<b>Notes</b>

<p>
Also read the
<a href="stats.html#NOTES">notes</a>
provided on our main statistics page if you haven't already.

<p>
All Webserver results derived from NetCraft and from querying the
remote webserver itself, at the time the mirror was taken.  We are
grateful for NetCraft:

<p>
<a href="http://www.netcraft.com">NetCraft</a><br>

<p>
<b>This data is unweighted</b>.  That means that I have made no effort to
present numbers or counts that are proportional to the distribution
of venders in the webserver market.  Therefore, keep in mind that,
for instance, the pie chart above is NOT the distribution of the
webserver market by vender.  It is the distribution of webservers by
vender that have been reported defaced, verified, and mirrored at
Attrition.org since we began keeping OS and webserver data in August,
1999.  Why would someone want to weight the data?  Market weighted
data could be used to show the proportional differences between venders
in the context of web defacements to infer differences in webserver
security.  While of great interest, and one of the most frequent requests
we get for our statistics pages, it's easy to naively infer webserver 
security on this weighted data and get matters very wrong.  For instance,
did Apache suddenly become a less secure webserver due to the recent wu-ftpd
exploit (also discussed below)?  I reckon not.  Nor would it be advisable to
infer Linux was any less secure an OS due to wu-ftpd.  Not to say weighting
data is bad.  It's the inferences we draw from weighted data that is open to
question.  Inferences drawn from known vulnerabilities of vender webservers
seems more reasonable and balanced, and would be very interesting.  For
those wishing to swim these murky waters, NetCraft, linked above, does 
provide extensive vender data for the webserver market for weighting data.

<p>
<b>Moving Averages</b> are used frequently, especially in financial 
markets.  Moving averages smooth the variance out of data, and may
help indicate trends.  A proportional (by percent, for instance) 
moving average also readily shows shifts from one item to another.
In this context, the recent 
<a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/frames/?content=/vdb/bottom.html%3Fvid%3D1387">
wu-ftpd bug</a>
which was widely exploited starting at least in early June of 2000 is
readily seen in the shift away from NT defacements toward OSs frequently
running wu-ftpd, mostly various Linux distributions.  Webservers, primarily
running Apache on Linux, went up subsequently, while IIS dipped as Linux
became a prime target as is obvious in the graphs above, especially the
proportional moving average graphs.


<p>
All Venders are aggregated over all versions.  We will present detailed
tables of version break-downs, cross-referenced by OS distribution, etc.,
in the near future.

<p>
The "All Other" webserver designation significantly includes any webserver
that we were not able to get an identification for.  While this is a small
count overall, it is large relative to the "All Other" webserver category.
