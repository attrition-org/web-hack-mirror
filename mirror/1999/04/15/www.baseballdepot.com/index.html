Hello, We are here to note that infomation on this site is not safe. Anyone
submitting a credit card number or any other infomation on this site can
be seen by malicious &quot;crackers&quot; and can be used to do alot of
illegal actions with that information. We have breached this sites security
for one reason and one reason only, These's people are not as safe as they
SAY they are and who they come out to be. How do you know you are safe
on the internet alone? Is someone watching you?<BR>
Who is the person looking at your information and who processes your information?
You don't know.. Our reason for this was that the security on this site
was so un-professional that we had to say something about it. You can't
trust anyone anymore. Blame it on low lack of laziness to make a quick
dollor. Anyone can say your information is SAFE on the internet, But is
it true, is it really safe?<BR>
<BR>
Anyone can throw up a quick website without getting security or care about
making their customers safe.. You know why? They are greedy and want money.
Do you want to get stuff from someone who doesn't give a shit about you?
The government makes &quot;hackers&quot; look bad when really they are
&quot;crackers&quot; and &quot;script kiddies&quot; who don't know shit
about what they are doing but to run someone else's program by typing a
simple name to run it who make the real &quot;hackers&quot; look bad..
Government doesn't give a shit about you either but when they use you to
take taxes out and use only so much out of them for city work.. &quot;
&quot;HOW&quot; is the keyword to everything! (Pr0xy) &quot; Becase if
you didn't know how then you couldn't do it..... Real &quot;hackers&quot;
are your friend they show what needs to be seen and they comment on what
needs commented about. Most people see &quot;crackers&quot; and &quot;script
kiddies&quot; as &quot;hackers&quot;. This was not a random site, this
was a site chosen by us to look at becase of it's content..<BR>
<BR>
NOTE:&nbsp;This is not to hurt this companys reputation. Everyone makes
mistakes even the best!...<BR>
<BR>
Remember, Watch who you give your information to.. Be safe and keep it
real.........<BR>
