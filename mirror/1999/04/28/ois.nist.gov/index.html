Hacking is a learning experience, not a crime.<BR>
There is no sense in sending today's intelligent<BR>
youth to jail for a "crime" that can be fixed<BR>
in a matter of seconds. Today's society is so<BR>
warped that the people who find the problems in<BR>
computer security are the ones who are frowned<BR>
upon instead of the ones who are really at fault.<BR>
So while you are reading this file the FBI is<BR>
probably trying to find this little bastard who<BR>
showed them up. But at the same time there are<BR>
children being exploited all over the world and<BR>
innocent people being killed, but who cares, I<BR>
damaged someones ego, therefore I am the real<BR>
enemy. So until next time, En Fin La Paix - Dv8.
