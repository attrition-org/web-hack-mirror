The world today is fucked up. Teens shooting up schools. What is the world coming
to? The fucked up thing is it is all blamed on the media. The MEDIA of all things.
The shooting at Columbine High School was blamed on things like Doom and
Marily Manson. Come on. Doom is one of the greatest shoot-em-up games made (next to Quake).
Go download Doom at http://www.idsoftware.com. I can't believe the shooting was blamed on
Marilyn Manson. Manson is the greatest band in the world. Let's piss people off, go visit 
Marilyn Manson's web site at http://www.marilyn-manson.com.
