</CENTER><H3>INTRODUCTION </H3>
During the summer of 1996, the UMKC School of Biological Sciences assigned 
an undergraduate advisor the task of making personal contact with medical schools 
in the Midwest and determining their admissions requirements.  The advisor traveled to 
15 medical schools, spoke with admissions officials, viewed facilities and spoke with 
students in some cases.  This file contains a summary of the information gleaned from these contacts.
<P>
The School of Biological Sciences has compiled specific notes from the interviews with each 
school into a binder.  Students may review &quot;SBS Notes of Medical School Admissions Meetings&quot; in the Undergraduate Programs Office, room 013 BSB.

<HR><A NAME="Look"></A><CENTER><A HREF="#TOC">[Table of Contents]</A> 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="#Top">[Top]</A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="../sbshome.html">[Home]</A>
</CENTER><H3>What are medical schools looking for in an applicant ?</H3>
Each medical school has its own idea of what type of person makes a good physician.  
There are, however, some characteristics that seem to be important to most schools.
<OL><LI><B>Academic ability.</B>  Medical students must be able to handle a very rigorous medical 
curriculum.  Medical schools look for students who have demonstrated that they can successfully 
handle a substantial course load which includes demanding science courses.  A high GPA with &quot;fluff&quot; 
courses does not generally impress admissions officials.   Schools want students who have a background 
in the humanities as well as the sciences and who are self motivated learners.  Medical schools also 
look for evidence that students can handle the stress that accompanies juggling studies with other activities.
<LI><B>Interpersonal skills.</B>  Physicians must be able to communicate effectively with their patients 
and colleagues.  Admissions committees look for evidence of an applicant's ability to work in a team setting 
and  take on leadership roles.
<LI><B>Motivation for medicine.</B>  Schools want students who are well aware of the commitment 
involved in practicing medicine.  Students who have experience in the medical field (as a volunteer in a 
hospital or clinic, for example) are able to make an informed decision about medicine as a career.  
Schools also want evidence that the student has empathy and compassion for others and a desire to 
be of service.  Knowledge of current health care issues also demonstrates a student's motivation for medicine.
<LI><B>Involvement.</B>  Medical schools seek individuals with a wide range of interests that extend 
outside of science and medicine.  Involvement in extracurricular and community activities which include 
leadership roles are viewed highly by admissions committees.  
</OL>
Each school emphasizes different aspects of this abbreviated list.  <I>Keep in mind that if a school does 
not believe you can handle the medical curriculum, all the compassion, involvement and interpersonal skills 
in the world won't get you admitted.</I>	

<HR><A NAME="UGed"></A><CENTER><A HREF="#TOC">[Table of Contents]</A> 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="#Top">[Top]</A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="../sbshome.html">[Home]</A>
</CENTER><H3>Your Undergraduate Education</H3>
<H4><U>Choosing a major</U></H4>
Throughout our discussions with admissions officials, never once did anyone say that he/she favors one 
undergraduate major over another.  In fact, many schools value diversity in the student body and encourage 
those with majors in the humanities and social sciences to apply.<BR>
You should choose a major in which you are genuinely interested for two reasons:
<OL><LI>Competition for medical school admission is steep and you may not be selected.  You will want to have the option to pursue another career you will enjoy.
<LI>If you are admitted to medical school, this may be your last opportunity to study another area in depth. 
</OL>
<P>For students at UMKC, the Biology major is the most direct route for completing a Bachelor's degree while 
also completing the minimal admission requirements as well as more advanced biology courses recommended 
by most medical schools.  By combining the courses required and/or recommended by the medical schools 
for admission with the requirements for a Bachelor's degree, students can efficiently reach both goals.<BR>
Many students interested in medical school choose biology because it is an exciting field and 
can prepare the student for careers in pharmaceutical, food or agricultural industries, allied health fields 
or graduate school.

<A NAME="Required"></A><H4><U>Planning courses</U></H4>
Most medical schools require the following one year (two semesters) courses for admission:
<I>General Biology</I>, <I>General Chemistry</I>, <I>Organic Chemistry</I> and <I>General Physics</I>, all with labs.<BR>
These courses are also requirements for the Biology major.
<P>In addition, some schools require <I>Calculus</I>, <I>English</I>, and/or <I>Computer Science</I>.<BR>
Students are encouraged to seek information on individual schools to determine specific requirements.   
<P>Many medical schools suggest taking science courses in addition those mentioned above.  
Several strongly recommend taking <I>Biochemistry</I> because it  helps to have this background during the first year 
of medical school.<BR>
In addition, <I>Genetics</I>, <I>Cell Biology</I>, <I>Developmental Biology</I> and other upper level biology 
courses are encouraged by medical schools.  Some medical schools also prefer students who have had some 
<I>research experience</I>.<BR>
For additional courses recommended by specific Midwestern medical schools, students are referred to the 
&quot;SBS Notes of Medical School Admissions Meetings&quot; binder in the Undergraduate Programs Office.
<P>With very few exceptions, the <A HREF="../ugrdprog.html#Programs">Bachelor of Science in Biology</A> from the 
School of Biological Sciences will fulfill the minimum entrance requirements for medical school.  
The <A HREF="../ugrdprog.html#Programs">Bachelor of Arts in Biology</A> can be modified slightly 
to include them.<BR>
Furthermore, both degrees incorporate, as requirements or electives, the recommended courses mentioned above 
including the opportunity to participate in scientific research.<BR>
The Bachelor of Science in Biology is especially challenging and an excellent preparation for the rigors of medical school.
<P>The School of Biological Sciences offers <B>the only program at UMKC</B> with the recommended upper-level science 
courses such as <I>Developmental Biology</I>, <I>Biochemistry</I> or <I>Molecular Biology</I>.  Only students who have taken 
<I>Genetics</I> and <I>Cell Biology</I> are able to take these courses.  Thus, to give yourself the best chance of 
acceptance, a <B><A HREF="../ugrdprog.html#Programs">major in Biology</A></B> through the School of Biological Sciences is strongly recommended.
<P>None of the medical schools interviewed give preference to a <B>B.S.</B> degree over a <B>B.A.</B> degree.  
Admissions committee members are more concerned with the individual's actual course work.  
They are looking for students who perform well while taking a full, rigorous academic load which includes pre-medical courses.  
Your advisor can work with you to plan course loads that are reasonable yet challenging.
<P>For students who must work while attending classes, carrying sixteen or seventeen hours may not be possible or advisable.  
Most medical schools realize that some students must work while completing their undergraduate degree and will take work 
schedules into consideration when evaluating the student's academic record.<BR>
Keep in mind, however, that working is not an excuse for poor academic performance.

<H4><U>Looking to the future</U></H4>
Use the first couple of years of your undergraduate work to investigate medicine as a career.  
Volunteering at a hospital or clinic or in some health related area can be an excellent way to experience the field of 
medicine and determine if medicine is the right career choice for you.  Reading journal articles also gives insight into 
the current issues in medicine.
<P>This is also a good time to begin investigating medical schools to which you will be applying.  
Each school has its own teaching philosophy and unique curriculum features.
<UL><LI>The School of Biological Sciences <I>Undergraduate Programs Office</I> has information on some medical schools.
<LI>Write to others that you are considering or visit their <I>Web Sites</I> on the Internet.  Many sites have student pages which 
can give you excellent insights into student life.
<LI><B>Medical School Admissions Requirements</B>, published by the 
<A HREF="http://www.aamc.org">Association of American Medical Colleges</A> (AAMC), 
is also a good source of information.
</UL>
At some point, you will need to ask professors for <A HREF="#Letters">Letters of Recommendation</A>.  Letters are the most helpful if the writer has 
had personal contact with the applicant.  Make an effort to get to know your professors.  If you do not anticipate any 
more contact with a certain professor, you may wish to ask him or her to write a letter immediately after you have taken his/her course.<BR>  
Have the professor send the letter directly to the School of Biological Sciences Undergraduate Programs Office.  
The office will hold the letter until you apply to medical school.  If a significant amount of time has passed since the letter 
was written, we will return the letter to the professor and ask if he/she would like to revise it before it is sent out.  
This works well because a professor may have over 200 students in one class and may not remember you individually 
two or three years later.

<H4><U>The Non-Traditional Student</U></H4>
In recent years, the number of medical school applicants who are seeking a second career, who are returning 
to school after an absence or who attend part time because of financial or family reasons is on the rise.  
Many of these students have work and family commitments that prevent them from fully participating in campus life 
or from taking a full academic load.  These applicants are not necessarily at a disadvantage.  
Most admissions committees take many factors into account when evaluating an applicant.  
Many medical schools welcome these applicants because these individuals tend to be mature and motivated learners. 

<H4><U>Minority and Economically Disadvantaged Applicants</U></H4>
In recent years, there has been a push to increase the number of  health care professionals from racial groups that 
have traditionally been underrepresented.  There are local and national programs designed to enhance a student's 
preparation for admission to a health professional program.  Because government funding changes from year to year, 
the availability of these programs may also change.  See an advisor for more information. 

<HR><A NAME="MCAT"></A><CENTER><A HREF="#TOC">[Table of Contents]</A> 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="#Top">[Top]</A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="../sbshome.html">[Home]</A>
</CENTER><H3>Taking the MCAT</H3>
The <A HREF="http://www.aamc.org/stuapps/admiss/mcat/">Medical College 
Admissions Test</A> (MCAT) should not be attempted before the completion of the medical school 
<A HREF="#Required">prerequisite courses</A>.  Students generally take the MCAT in April of their junior year.  
(At this point, many students have not actually completed their pre-medical courses but are very close to doing so.)<BR>
Taking the <I>April MCAT</I> also allows the timely reporting of scores to AMCAS (American Medical College Application 
Service) or any non-AMCAS schools and allows the student to retake the MCAT in August if necessary. The <B>registration 
deadline</B> for the April MCAT is in <B>March</B>.<BR>
It is strongly recommended that you take the April MCAT.
<P>All sets of MCAT scores are reported to the medical schools; therefore, it is not advised that you take the MCAT 
&quot;just to see how you do.&quot;<BR>
Preparation for the test is very important.  Spending a lot of money on a commercial review course is not necessary to do 
well on the MCAT.  It is recommended, however, that time is spent both reviewing important concepts from science courses 
and practicing questions similar in format to those on the test.<BR>
There are several <I>MCAT review and practice</I> manuals and review courses available in the Kansas City area.  See an advisor for more information.  
<P>Medical schools vary in the way they view multiple sets of MCAT scores.  In deciding whether or not to retake the test, 
keep in mind that retaking the test does not mean you will do better.  See the section &quot;Retaking the  MCAT&quot; in the MCAT Announcement booklet.
<P>The <I>MCAT registration packet</I> contains the current MCAT Announcement.  This booklet has valuable information on 
the types of questions asked, procedures on the test day and policies on score reporting and cancellation of scores.  
Read this booklet thoroughly and retain it in case you have questions later.

</CENTER><H3>Application to Medical School</H3>
<H4><U>The Application Process and AMCAS</U></H4>
<UL><DL><DT>AMCAS (<A HREF="http://www.aamc.org/stuapps/">American Medical College Application 
Service</A>) is used by the vast majority of medical schools in the U.S.  
<DT>The applicant sends one application form, MCAT scores and official college transcripts to AMCAS.
<DT>AMCAS verifies the information submitted on the application, adds the MCAT scores and forwards it to the medical 
schools of the applicant's choice.
</DL></UL>
If a school participates in AMCAS, you are required to apply in this manner.  
<P>Several U.S. and all Canadian medical schools do not participate in AMCAS.  The U.S. non-AMCAS schools 
include Yale, Harvard, UMKC, Columbia University, New York University, University of Rochester, University of 
North Dakota, Brown University, Baylor, Texas A&amp;M, Texas Tech and the University of Texas System.<BR>
You should write to these schools for application materials and send MCAT scores directly to them.
<P><U>The number one piece of advice from medical school admissions officials:</U> <B>APPLY EARLY</B>.  
<UL><DL><DT>We recommend that a student work on the AMCAS application during the <I>summer</I> of the year prior to the year of intended 
matriculation.
<U><DT>Medical schools' deadlines</U> for receipt of the AMCAS application vary from October 15 to December 15.
</DL></UL>
Once you submit the completed forms to AMCAS, <B>at least two weeks</B> are necessary to process your application and send 
copies to the schools of your choice.  During peek times, processing takes longer.<BR>
It is advisable to submit your application to AMCAS as early as possible, to allow adequate time for processing.
<P>The following are some tips for completing the AMCAS Application.  
<UL><LI>	Read through the <I>instruction booklet</I> before starting.  Retain these instructions for reference after submitting your application.
<LI>Under <I>extracurricular activities</I> and <I>employment</I> sections, include the dates of the activity, the approximate 
number of hours per week and any leadership roles you assumed.  If a job or volunteer work relates to the medical profession, 
give a brief description of your duties as space allows. 
<LI>The <I>personal statement</I> is your chance to articulate who you are and your reasons for seeking a career in 
medicine.  You should spend plenty of time with this section.  Be specific when discussing what experiences and/or people 
have influenced you in your career choice.  You may also wish to explain any discrepancies in the rest of your application 
in this space.<BR>
<UL><LI>Give your statement to several different people to read and give their reactions.
<LI>Proof-read it for spelling and grammatical errors carefully!  
<LI>Do not use tiny size type.   
</UL>
<LI>Obtain a student copy of your <I>transcript</I> from each institution you attended and refer to it as you fill out the <I>academic record</I> 
portion.  AMCAS checks this section against the official transcripts received directly from the institution, so be accurate.  
Read through the directions carefully before starting this section.
<LI>You may wish to consult an <I>advisor</I> when deciding to which medical schools to apply.
<LI>Type the application or use AMCAS-E. <U>Keep a copy</U> of everything submitted.
</UL>
<H4><U>Supplemental Applications</U></H4>
Once the medical schools receive your AMCAS application, they will usually send a &quot;supplemental&quot; or &quot;secondary&quot; application.  
The supplemental applications vary from school to school. (&quot;SBS Notes of Medical School Admissions Meetings&quot; contains copies 
and/or descriptions of supplemental applications from the medical schools interviewed.)  
<UL><LI>Answer the questions posed with as much care as you prepared your personal statement on the AMCAS form.  
<LI>Letters of Recommendation are also requested at this time (see below).
<LI>Return all materials to the respective admissions offices as soon as you can because files are often reviewed in the order they become complete.
</UL>

<A NAME="Letters"></A><H4><U>Letters of Recommendation</U></H4>
Many schools have a pre-medical committee, which receives letters (some for a fee) from faculty and composes a composite 
letter to send to medical schools of the applicant's choice.  The UMKC School of Biological Sciences (SBS) does not have such a committee.  
SBS believes that professors with whom the student has had personal contact are the best suited to discuss the qualities of the student.  
Therefore, instead of a composite letter, SBS will receive letters from individual faculty and send packets of letters to medical schools at 
the student's request.  Students in the School of Biological Sciences are advised to use this free service.
<P>Medical schools' admissions officials say the vast majority of the recommendation letters are mediocre and, consequently, not very helpful.  
<UL><LI>You are advised to ask professors that know you well and feel that they can write a <B>strong letter</B> on your behalf.<BR> 
When asking for a letter, you may want to ask directly, &quot;Do you feel comfortable writing a strong letter on my behalf?&quot;
<LI>Usually three letters of recommendation from professors, at least two of which are science faculty, are needed.
<LI>Additional letters may be submitted from employers or advisors who know the applicant well.
</UL>
Refer to information from the individual schools for the number and types of references desired.  The &quot;SBS Notes of Medical 
School Admissions Meetings&quot; may also be helpful.<BR>
<UL>It is a good idea to give each reference plenty of time to compose a letter.  We suggest asking the person before summer 
vacation after your junior year.</UL>
<P>Pick up a &quot;<U>Request for Letter of Recommendation</U>&quot; form for each reference in the SBS Undergraduate Programs Office. 
<UL><LI>On the form you will indicate whether you are retaining or waving your right to read the letter so that the referee will know your intentions.
<LI>The reverse side of the form contains a list of what many admissions committees would like to see addressed in letters of recommendation.  
<LI>This can be used as a guide to help your reference write a complete and detailed letter for you.
<LI>Give this form to the person writing the letter.  
<LI>This form will be returned to our office with the letter of recommendation.
</UL>
Upon receipt of the supplemental application from a medical school, the student can request that a packet of letters be sent to that school 
by filling out a &quot;<U>Request for Submission of Letters of Recommendation</U>&quot; form in our office.
<P>A short note thanking each reference for her/his time and effort is a good practice.  You may need another letter from this person later.

<H4><U>General Pointers</U></H4>
<UL><LI>Apply early.
<LI>Type everything that will go to the school and include your social security number.
<LI>Get letters early.
<LI>Keep in mind that any and all correspondence with the school may be added to your file including thank you notes.
<LI>Keep copies of <U>everything</U>.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="#Top">[Top]</A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="../sbshome.html">[Home]</A>
</CENTER><H3>Interviews</H3>
The interview is very important because characteristics such as communication skills, compassion and sincere motivation 
for medicine are assessed at this time.  The school will also determine if you and the school are a good match. 
<P>Interviews are conducted in a variety of formats. See &quot;SBS Notes of Medical School Admissions Meetings&quot; for descriptions of 
the interview formats of several medical schools and some typical questions.<BR> 
In general, be prepared to <I>discuss your personal statement</I> and supplemental application and to <I>explain discrepancies</I> in your 
transcripts and MCAT scores.  Schools may also be looking for your <I>knowledge of current health care issues</I>.<BR>
We advise you to find out as much as possible about <I>the school and its curriculum</I> before the interview so that you can <I>ask any questions</I> 
that you may have and articulate your reasons for wanting to attend that particular school.

<H3>How Medical Schools (especially M.U.) Choose their Students</H3>
<B><CENTER>A Summary Of Essential Issues</CENTER></B>

<OL><LI><B>Grades.</B>  Demonstration that the student is able to do well in science courses is a must.  
Generally, students with overall GPAs less than 3.2 and science GPAs less than 3.2 are poor candidates.  
For MU's entering Class of 1992, the average undergraduate GPA was 3.55 and the average science GPA was 3.50 
(the national means were 3.44 and 3.37, respectively).
<LI><B>MCAT.</B>  For most schools, generally good performance (8 or above) is expected.  MU's entering Class of 
1992 posted the following MCAT averages:  8.7 for Biological Sciences, 8.4 for Physical Sciences, and 9.1 for Verbal Reasoning 
(national averages were 9.2, 9.0, and 9.2, respectively).  It is also important that the MCAT scores reflect the GPA.  
While there are many good reasons for discrepancies, a student with high grades and low MCAT scores (or vice versa) 
can expect to be asked to explain the discrepancy at an interview.  A few schools (Johns Hopkins and University of Rochester, 
for example) do not use the MCAT for admissions.
<LI><B>Activities.</B>  Strong candidates for medical school have spent time in community or university service.  
Physicians need to have a good sense of community responsibility, and activities that reflect this make the student a 
more competitive applicant.  Involvement in student organizations, student government, church or charitable organizations 
strengthens an application to medical school.  Any leadership role the student played in these organizations is also evaluated 
favorably.  Research experience is also a positive factor (it is required of applicants for combined MD/PhD programs or programs 
that emphasize research in the medical curriculum).  Employment may also be considered a strong positive.
<LI><B>Letters of recommendation.</B>  Letters are an important part of the application.  It is important that as many of the 
recommenders as possible know the applicant well.  Most schools ask for a letter from the Premedical Advisory Committee which 
prepares a composite document from several faculty assessments.  Additional letters from community organizations or from 
an employer are usually helpful.  Letters from government officials or from family friends and relatives are generally not helpful 
and may be a detriment in some reviewers' opinions.  Students are advantaged by letters reflecting substantive relationships with a few instructors.
<LI><B>Interview.</B>  While it is understood that a 30-minute interview does not always represent the student well, this exchange 
gives the medical school a chance to assess the interpersonal skills of the student and to ask about inconsistencies in the record.  
The interview is really of more value to the student than the school, since the student is then allowed to discuss some aspects of the 
scholastic or extracurricular activities record that might not be well represented in the standardized application document.  
Additionally, this exposure allows the student to evaluate the institution in preparation for making the final selection decision.<BR>
Types of interviews range from individual, to group, to panel or jury.  Furthermore, candidates should be aware that 'non-interview' schools 
(e.g., University of Illinois, University of Iowa, and Brown) interview a small number of candidates about whom they need more information 
but, for the bulk of their candidates, they carefully review academic credentials and rely heavily on the personal statement and letters of 
reference submitted on behalf of the candidate.

<H3>Successful Interview Techniques</H3>
<B><CENTER>Sample Interview Questions</CENTER></B><BR>
Your interviews will ask a variety of questions, and your answers would demonstrate your maturity, 
character, knowledge, and ability to communicate.  There's really no way to &quot;study&quot; for an interview, 
but it might be useful just for practice to think about how you would answer them.
<UL><LI>How do you know that medicine is for you?
<LI>What has been your most important accomplishment?
<LI>Do you think doctors are viewed with as much awe as in the past?
<LI>Is medicine becoming more technical, and is this beneficial?
<LI>What do you think of euthanasia?  Abortion?
<LI>Who is to blame for the increasing health care costs?
<LI>What are your strong points?  What are your weaknesses?
<LI>Do you have any hobbies?
<LI>Tell us about yourself.
<LI>Are you interested in any specialties?
<LI>What will you do if you don't get accepted to medical school?
<LI>Why do you want to work with sick people?
<LI>Do you think doctors are overpaid?
<LI>Do you feel you are prepared well enough?
<LI>Why did you apply to this school?  What other schools did you apply to?  Why?
<LI>How will you finance your education?
<LI>Tell us about your undergraduate institution.
<LI>When did you decide to become a doctor?
<LI>Would you consider applying to a foreign medical school if you were rejected?
<LI>Are quotas fair?
<LI>Are you concerned about the surplus of doctors that is supposed to occur when you are out practicing?
<LI>What makes you different from everyone else?
<LI>What do you know about AIDS?  How do you feel about treating male homosexuals?
<LI>What three adjectives best describe you?
<LI>What do you see yourself doing 10 years from now?<BR>
<UL><I>A very popular question.  Unfortunately, one student answered, &quot;Uh, this is Wednesday, about two 
o'clock, right?&quot;  The interviewer said, &quot;Yes, it is.&quot;  As he swung his arm up as if he were holding 
a golf club, he said, &quot;I should be on the eighth hole.&quot;  Apparently, his humor wasn't appreciated - he 
was rejected by that school.</I>
</UL><LI>Where would you want to go to medical school, given the choice?
<LI>How do you see integrating medicine and family life?
<LI>What do you do for fun?
<LI>Describe your relationship with your mother/father/siblings.
<LI>What do you know about hospices, HMOs, or PPOs?
<LI>How do you think malpractice will affect you?
<LI>What do you expect to get from medicine?
<LI>What questions do you have?
<UL><I>You could ask:
<LI>What do you think are this school's weaknesses and how are they being  improved?  
<LI>What research opportunities would I have?  
<LI>How is your school unique?  
<LI>How would you describe the typical class personality here?</I>
</UL></UL>
NOTE:  After the interview, jot down the questions you were asked.  There's a good 
chance you'll get similar questions in subsequent interviews.  
If you take a few minutes to study the questions and your responses, you'll have better answers 
in your next interview.
