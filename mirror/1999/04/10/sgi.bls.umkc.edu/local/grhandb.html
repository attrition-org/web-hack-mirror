<P>Welcome to the on-line version of the Graduate Programs Handbook 
which is accessible to UMKC students and faculty with local access 
(i.e. any 'umkc.edu' server). The purpose of this Handbook is to summarize 
in one place the <A HREF="http://www.umkc.edu/catalog/bio-sc/0000.html">School of Biological Sciences' 
graduate programs</A>, the requirements for graduate degrees, and
various academic rules and regulations.  It offers guidelines
to practical procedures like <A HREF="../gradinfo.html">on-line inquiry</A> capability.
<BR>Note that academic regulations may change over time.  If questions
arise, please contact the Graduate Programs Office (phone <B>(816) 235-1385</B>)
and help to keep this Handbook up to date.  For additional information
about rules and regulations, students are referred to the

<P>The graduate programs at the School of Biological
Sciences are administered in coordination with the 
<A HREF="http://www.umkc.edu/sgs">School
of Graduate Studies</A> of the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
<UL>
<LI>The doctoral faculty in the two administrative divisions
of the School represent two Disciplines that are part of the
UMKC-wide Interdisciplinary Ph.D. program: <B>Molecular Biology
and Biochemistry (MBB)</B> and <B>Cell Biology and Biophysics
(CBB)</B>. Interdisciplinary Ph.D. students in the School of
Biological Sciences (SBS) must have MBB or CBB as a Coordinating
Discipline (also called Primary Discipline) or as a Co-discipline.
<LI>The School of Biological Sciences offers a <B>Master's
of Science (M.S.) in Cellular and Molecular Biology (CMB)</B>. 
<LI>The School of Biological Sciences offers a <B>Master's
of Arts (M.A.) in Biology</B>.  Students may pursue a certificate
in the Truman Medical Center Nurse Anesthesia Program concurrently.
</UL>

<P>The Handbook's <A HREF="#TOC">Table of Contents</A> 
is organized in the order of progress toward the degree.  It
lists the various steps along the way towards completion of
the degree.  The printed version of the Handbook, available
from the Graduate Programs Office, Room 016 BSB, contains many
of the forms that are required during progression towards the
degree.  In the current on-line version, these forms are not
available.  However, all forms can be obtained from the
Graduate Programs Office, Room 016 BSB.
<P>Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves
with the general and specific requirements, applicable to their
degree.  Students are also responsible for knowing the rules and
regulations contained herein, as well as in the UMKC General Catalog. 
The Graduate Programs Office is available to answer questions
and assist students.  However, knowledge of the requirements,
rules and regulations is ultimately the responsibility of the
student.
