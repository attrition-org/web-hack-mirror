</UL>
<A NAME="Schedule"></A>
To best assist you, we request that you make a tentative schedule of the classes you wish to take <U>and</U> bring it with you to your advising appointment.<BR>
<B>Even though the official &quot;<U>Class Schedule &amp; Guide</U>&quot; is the only 'official' list for course information, especially reference numbers, once printed, the Class Schedule is rapidly outdated by corrections.  Students will be able to browse the <A HREF="http://www.umkc.edu/registrar/sch.html">On-Line Class Schedules</A> which will be  kept up-to-date on a (bi-)weekly basis.</B>
<P><B>IF</B> you are a student that wants to transfer into Biology, e.g. from the College of Arts and Sciences or from one of the area's Community Colleges, clearly state this when you make an appointment.  These appointments are set for 45 minutes. 
<P>Appointments should also be set for questions and concerns that may take 15 minutes or more to discuss.

<H2>WALK-INS</H2>
<P><B>Winter Semester 1999</B></P>
<P>Advisors are usually available for walk-ins each  day.  Walk-in advising  is reserved for non-registration questions requiring less than 15 minutes.  
Call 235-1385 or come to room B016 in the School of Biological Sciences for available walk-in advising times.</P>
