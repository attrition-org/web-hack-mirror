<H2><A NAME="Interest"></A>Research Interest Areas</H2>

<P>A diverse range of basic and applied research projects are underway
in the School. The studies encompass a variety of aspects of an overall
research program on Molecular Recognition in Biological Systems. They are,
however, viewed from different basic multidisciplinary perspectives.</P>

<H3>Molecular Biology/Biochemistry (MBB)</H3>

<DL>
<DD>In this field, research interests of the faculty include investigations
in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, in which they study bacteria, viruses
and animal cells, and focus on such issues as gene structure and evolution,
regulation of gene expression, and structure-function relationships in
enzymes and membranes, including protein engineering. Their research uses
the latest recombinant DNA techniques such as gene cloning, PCR amplification,
DNA sequencing, <I>in vitro</I> mutagenesis and hybridization analysis.</DD>

<DT><IMG SRC="gif/bullet.gif" ALT="-" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14> Individual research interests
are described in the <A HREF="doctmbb.html">MBB
Doctoral Faculty Listing</A>. </DT></DL>

<H3>Cell Biology/Biophysics (CBB)</H3>

<DL><DD>A biophysical approach is primarily responsible for many recent spectacular
advances in biotechnology and in the studies of cell membranes, biological
macromolecules, neurobiology and enzyme mechanisms. Because of this, in
this School the biophysical approach becomes the interprogrammatic crossroad
for all investigators and provides the connective glue in investigating
structure/function relationships necessary for all other areas of research
interest.</DD>
