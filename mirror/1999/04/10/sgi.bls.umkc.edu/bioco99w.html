<CENTER><H3>THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION</H3></CENTER>
<P>One of the few areas of general agreement regarding the cost of higher education is that it is the most expensive form of education.  Yet, there is a significant amount of misunderstanding as to who pays for it.  At a public university, there should be no misunderstanding that the taxpayers, both of the state and the nation do.  According to President Pacheco's November 20, 1998, presentation to the Curators of the University of Missouri, student tuition comprises just 18 percent of the university's total revenue, a figure similar to that of major universities, i.e., ones capable of awarding terminal degrees (doctorates) and professional degrees (medicine, dentistry, law, etc.).  

<p>At UMKC, which has a low research income, few income-producing auxiliary services, and low endowment and high subsidy to the health professions, the percentage that student tuition contributes to revenues is akin to one third of the total budget.  A healthy sum is paid for their education, not just on the part of the beneficiary but by citizens at large.  It is in the nation's interest to build an educated citizenry, hence the subsidy to this education.  First, funds are provided by the legislature of the state of Missouri, by far the most generous contributor (about 40 percent) to the UMKC campus.  Second, we receive federal support for a variety of education programs, scholarships and other subsidies.  And third, support comes from research grants and training programs.</p>

<p>Through these pages I have stated or implied that this school is one of the best-kept secrets in the region.  It offers the best educational value.  This assertion is based upon the calculation that while student tuition revenues represent only 20 percent of the school's total budget, we are able to offer our majors unique opportunities unavailable anywhere else.  To begin with, we have an excellent faculty to student ratio.  In addition, all faculty teaching our major courses possess Ph.D.s while all lower division courses are taught by faculty experts in their disciplines who are active in the advancement of knowledge.  Faculty expertise encompasses over 30 different areas, and our curriculum is modern and interdisciplinary between physical and life sciences.  We integrate textbook-based knowledge with preparation for problem solving and development of skills for acquiring new knowledge, as represented by our writing intensive and synthesis courses.  Furthermore, in the past two years, our ability to offer undergraduate research opportunities to those qualified has expanded and such experiences are now available year-round. These standards cannot be achieved at any other college in the region, regardless of what they are charging for tuition; they result from being part f MU, the only state university system capable of awarding the highest academic degrees and with a charge for advancing knowledge.  We can do what others can only dream.</p>

<p>Yet perhaps the facet that contributes most to the difference between our program and others is the fact that our faculty is actively engaged in first-rate research.  This not only affects the level of competence and state of the art knowledge imparted by the teacher, it adds a seldom mentioned value: Because we have self-supporting researchers who earn their support from extramural (national) sources, no campus funds are directly used for faculty research. All resources allocated to the unit for education are used for that purpose.  Thus, the quality of education is enriched by the high caliber of the individual teachers while university-provided funding goes into education.  In addition, the availability of these teachers results in the existence of core facilities and instruction materials that are otherwise unattainable.  Such impact on this program has been enormous.  In 1992 when this school inherited the undergraduate program from the College of Arts and Sciences, only three and a half faculty positions were transferred.  The &quot;old biology&quot; department had been decimated, literally halved, in the last two years of its existence to balance the College's deficit.  No operating funds for teaching activities or secretarial staff were transferred to this school.  Teaching laboratories consisted of stuffed animals, dried plants, fossils and the like.  One does not have to be an old-timer to see that this situation is improving yearly, as demonstrated by the recent expenditure of over $60,000 for the acquisition of new microscopes for histology and cell biology.  And we intend to continue to improve resources while expanding our capabilities in what are becoming rare commodities elsewhere, hands-on laboratories.  The planned biochemistry and genetics laboratories are the latest in this modernization series to prepare our graduates to cope with the demands of jobs in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and environmental management industries.  Finally, instrumentation that is unique within a several hundred-mile radius is now accessible to those interested, and a growing number of students are taking advantage of it.</p>

<p>Our efforts have not always been welcome; indeed, they were detrimental in at least one case where students were the losers.  When this school assumed the B.A./B.S. programs in biology, over 80 percent of the students enrolled in the UMKC Medical School majored in biology.  When our faculty raised our academic standards, the School of Medicine was advised that a biology degree had to be earned and giving the students double, and in some cases triple, credit for courses that were already part of medical training would not be tolerated. UMKC medical students should receive an education equivalent to those elsewhere in the U.S.  Receiving a degree the old-fashioned way, by earning it, having demonstrated the same ability as those elsewhere in the nation (for the B.A. degree) was not embraced by those in charge of medical education in Kansas City.  The conflict was never resolved and now only about 2 percent of the medical class majors in biology.  By contrast, the U.S. average for graduating M.D.s showed that about 50 percent had received a bachelor's degree in a biological science!</p>

<p>At the School of Biological Sciences, we remain aware of our students' economic sacrifices to earn their education.  We strive to control these costs, and more importantly, prioritize efficiency to assure that our students receive the best return on their investment.  We also know that in spite of our progress to date, these are just steps in a path.  We must continue to improve our offerings and expand some priority areas in preparation for an intellectual and labor market that evolves.  Our aim for a long time will continue to be offering the best educational value in the region.  Nothing bespeaks better of our school than the quality of the education our degree holders carry with them after they graduate.  By your success we evaluate our worth as teachers and educators.</p>

Dean, School of Biological Sciences</p>

<A NAME="AA"></A><HR><div align="center"><h2>Important Information from SBS Academic Affairs</h2></div>
<h3>Introducing<br>
Dr. Bibie Chronwall, Associate Professor, Director of Curriculum</h3>
	<p>On February 1, 1999, Dean Martinez-Carrion appointed Dr. Bibie M. Chronwall as the new Director of Curriculum responsible for oversight of the programs of undergraduate studies and research.  Dr. Chronwall assumed these responsibilities upon the departure of Dr. Rona Hirschberg, Associate Dean, who accepted a position at the Center for Scientific Review, National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
	<p>Dr. Chronwall has been a faculty member in the School for many years.  She brings to the position a breadth of research and teaching experience.  She is eager to take on the challenges of this new position and looks forward to making significant contributions to improving all aspects of our undergraduate program.</p>     

<h3>RESEARCH</h3>	

	<p>The School's highly qualified faculty and state-of-the-art laboratory facilities provide an outstanding environment for undergraduates to do research.  Biology majors can be part of the process of creating new knowledge.  Only an academic unit at a research university can fully provide this experience.  This opportunity is implemented in three different ways: through the Saper Vedere Scholars Program; through the Honors Program, which is intertwined with the Saper Vedere organization; and through sponsorship of students' research by individual faculty. </p>    

<h3>SAPER VEDERE</h3>
	<p>This program takes its name from Leonardo da Vinci's unifying principle, &quot;to know how to see,&quot; and his lifetime devotion to establish interrelationships between art and science. He had a remarkable understanding of optics, mechanics, biology and cosmology.  The program focuses on the  practice of the scientific method in conjunction with the development of a keen sense of perception and an ability to represent and transmit acquired knowledge to others. </p>
	<p>The Saper Vedere Scholars program distinguishes itself from standard undergraduate research programs in several ways. First, it is a year round program beginning by the sophomore year.  In addition to hands-on laboratory research, the program includes a variety of intellectual and social activities.  Secondly, it is discovery-based, with mentor/pupil relationships occurring on a daily basis. Finally, it emphasizes integration of the principles of how new knowledge is created within the needs and wants of an educated society.</p> 
	<p>Saper Vedere Scholars is a highly selective program. Only eight freshmen/sophomore students are selected per year. Although a 3.1 science GPA is required throughout the program, GPA is not the sole criterion for selection. Evidence of a student's interest in sciences, research, discovery and integration of knowledge is expected.  Seminar series, meetings with distinguished visiting scholars, informal lunches, as well as formal gatherings of the Saper Vedere students and faculty are some of the activities to which the student must be willing to commit.  The program requires 15 hours of work (laboratory and other activities) per week during the academic year and full time during the summer.  Participating Saper Vedere Scholars receive fee remissions for Fall and Winter semesters and stipends during Summer.</p>

<h3>HONORS PROGRAM</h3>
	<p>The School's Honors Program is for qualified B.S. undergraduate students interested in pursuing rigorous preparation for advanced professional training and scientific careers.  The program combines a requirement for high levels of academic achievement along with the opportunity for undergraduate research experience and other enrichment activities. Students will participate in hands-on lab work, get to know faculty and graduate students, and will participate in the process of generating new knowledge.</p>
	<p>Only students with less than 70 credit hours will be considered for admission. Freshmen  with  a score of over 1300 on the SAT or 30 on the ACT who are in the top 10% of their high school graduating class will be considered for direct entry into the program.  Other students must have an overall GPA of 3.5 as well as a 3.5 math/science GPA, and have satisfactorily completed CHEM 211 and 212R, MATH 210, and BIOL 108 and BIOL 109 or equivalents.</p>
      <p>Students in the Honors Program will be assigned to an individual faculty advisor/mentor and will be included in scholarly and social events of the School. </p>

<h3>GRANT SUPPORTED UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH</h3>
        <p>SBS students may also become involved in research programs directed by individual faculty which are sponsored by federal grants.  Students interested in working with a particular faculty member should contact the individual faculty member and discuss their interests.  Students may receive undergraduate credit for their research experience.  In some cases, a stipend may also be paid.</p>  

	<p>Students interested in any of the above programs should contact one of the following members of the undergraduate programs office:<br>

<HR><div align="center"><H2><A NAME="AdvReg">Summer/Fall 1999 Group Advising</A></H2></div>
<p>Students in the School of Biological Sciences are <b>required</b> to be advised before registering for classes.  Instead of the traditional priority advising appointments, we will hold several <b>Group Advising Sessions</b>. During  these sessions, you will be provided with a CAPS report.  The CAPS report itemizes your degree requirements, telling you which you have met and which remain.  You will then be able to determine your own class schedule and obtain a registration release from an advisor.  Advisors will be presenting the <b>Group Advising Sessions</b>.</p>
<p>For those students who attend a <b>Group Advising Session</b> and have additional questions, there will be individual appointments available prior to registration. This is a huge advan-age when attending <b>Group Advising</b>.</p>  
<p>If you do not attend a <b>Group Advising Session</b>, advising appointments for summer and fall 1999 class schedules will not begin until April 19, after registration has already started.  By this time, some classes you may want or need could already be full.</p>
<p>If you are a new student at UMKC and were advised during LARD week (Jan. 4-8) for Winter Semester 1999, it is imperative that you make an appointment for full advising <U>BEFORE</U>  you attend a group advising session.</p>

<HR><h4>Did you Know..........</h4>
<p>The UMKC School of Biological Sciences was founded as the School of Basic Life Sciences in 1985, and became one of the 10 &quoteminence&quot programs established by the University of Missouri System-programs selected to achieve national and international prominence.   Since it was established, each year the school has brought in millions of dollars in extra-mural research funds.</p>  
<p>The school's goal from its earliest steps a decade ago was to position scientific thought beyond the campus to that of peerage among the great universities of the world. The education of undergraduates became a function of the school in 1992.  The Schools focus then included the purpose to prepare young minds to inquire about, address, and solve problems. </p>  
<p>As modern biologists, it is the school's responsibility to prepare our citizens for the age of recombinant drugs, genetic therapy, emerging viruses, new infectious diseases, drug resistant microorganisms, etc.  In the pursuit of quality, the faculty modernized the curriculum and introduced physical and chemical sciences for preparation in the understanding of molecular, cellular, and genetic concepts essential to advance the biological sciences and in health careers. The faculty also has recently modernized student preparation to levels similar to the median in the U.S., a preparation armed for eventually converging with that of leading curricula in the nation.</p>  
<p>Outstanding laboratory equipment includes an extensive array of modern instrumentation including  an electron microscope, X-ray diffractometer, automated oligonucleotide synthesizer, automated DNA sequencer, peptide synthesizer, molecular graphics workstation, an automated amino acid analyzer, confocal microscope and many types of spectroscopes, as well as facilities for cell culture and analysis.  The Linda Hall Library, internationally renowned science library, is located only one block away from the School.  Students also have access to the University's Miller Nichols Library.</p>

<HR><h4>Career options -- What's out there?</h4>
<p>There is an almost limitless variety of career options open to you.   In fact, the only real limits are those that are imposed by your own interests and your imagination.</p>
	<p>There are both professional scientists and science-trained professionals. In some careers, you will be deeply immersed in research and development. In others, you may use your science background in teaching, business, industry or government.   Investigate both kinds of career pathways.</p>
	<p>Whatever you think you want to do now, remember that most people change their career at least once in their lifetime. You will serve yourself best if you approach your undergraduate experience not as narrow training for a specific perfectly-defined career, but rather as preparation for a lifetime of creative problem solving.</p> 
	<p>You can enter many science and science-related careers directly, with only a bachelor's degree in biology. Jobs in the technical workforce are available in academic (e.g., research technician, teaching laboratory coordinator, greenhouse facilities coordinator), government, (e.g., research technician, regulatory agency field agent) and industry (e.g., research technician, life sciences product design and development specialist, technical product information specialist, quality control specialist, life science product sales).</p> 
	<p>Science-related careers that may require some limited additional study in another field include: science journalism (writers and editors), elementary and secondary education, medical technology, environmental regulation, pharmaceutical or agrochemical marketing/advertising,  economic development, bioinformatics, museum coordination.</p>
	<p>With a masters (MA) degree in the appropriate field you can become one of a group of science-trained professionals upon whom business, industry, government and education have come increasingly to depend. Careers include: genetic counseling, health care for the aged, public science and technology policy development and analysis, health policy development and analysis, environmental affairs.</p> 
	<p>You can combine an undergraduate degree in biology with professional degrees (e.g., MBA, JD) for a career in business or hospital management, stock/financial analysis of biotechnology firms, patent or technology transfer or environmental law, environmental engineering.</p> 
	<p>If you want to teach at the college or university level, or direct research projects in academia, government or industry, you will almost always need a doctoral (Ph.D.) degree. Occasionally an MD will suffice in the medical research arena. If you are interested in research, be sure you seriously consider a career in industry. The number of life scientists with a Ph.D. employed in business and industry has been increasing steadily. Today, over half of the new PhDs are employed outside academia. Of the senior scientists in business and industry, slightly over one-third have moved into management.</p> 
	<p>Experience tells us that you will probably have more than one job in your lifetime. Many of you will have multiple careers. The job market is constantly changing, and with increasing rapidity. These are the best reasons of all to develop a range of academic and career skills.</p>

<HR><p align="right"><h2>So you want to drop a course....</h2></p> 
<p>If you feel you must drop a course there are several issues that you need to consider before doing so.</p>

<h4><u>Drop Deadlines and what they mean.</u></h4>
<p>During the first four weeks of the semester, you can drop a course without any record on your transcript. It will appear as if you never registered for the course in the first place.  
Dropping during weeks 5 through 8 results in a straight course withdrawal.  The course title and a &quotW&quot will appear on your transcript. A &quotW&quot has no effect on your GPA.  The deadline for this type of withdrawal is called &quotLast day to withdraw without assessment.&quot<br>
Weeks 9 through 12 are called the assessment period.  If you withdraw from a course during this time, the instructor may assign you either a &quotW&quot or a &quotWF.&quot  <b>A &quotWF&quot has the same effect on your GPA as a regular &quotF&quot!!!!</b>  It is in your best interest to speak with the instructor before withdrawing during the assessment period to determine how you will be assessed.  If the instructor determines that you will receive a &quotWF,&quot it is better for you to stick it out and try to pull at least a D in the course.  The deadline for this type of withdrawal is called &quotLast day to withdraw for undergraduates.&quot</p>
<p><b>Beginning week 13, undergraduates cannot withdraw from a course, period.</b>  An instructor does not have the authority to withdraw a student.  The registrar will not withdraw a student at this point without the approval of the SBS Dean.  This approval is granted rarely and only for very extenuating circumstances.<br> 
All these periods are shortened proportionately for the summer semester terms.</p>
<h4><u>Money.</u></h4>
<p>Beginning the second day of classes, you can only get 90% of the course's tuition refunded.  The percentage refund dwindles rapidly as the weeks go by.<br>  
Dropping a course may have implications for your financial aid.   In order to renew your financial aid each year, you must complete 75% of the credit hours for which you enroll.  Your enrollment is determined at the end of the first week of classes.  If you feel the need to drop a course or two after the first week of classes, you should check with the financial aid office to see how this might effect your award.</p>
<h4><u>Progress toward your degree.</u></h4>
	<p>The biology curriculum is very structured.  Most biology courses have prerequisites and most are offered only once a year.  It is in your best interest to check with an advisor before dropping a course to determine how this will effect your progress toward your degree.</p>
