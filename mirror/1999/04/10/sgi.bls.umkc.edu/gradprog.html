<H2><A NAME="Programs"></A>Programs Description</H2>

<P>Graduate studies in the School of Biological Sciences focus on research
preparation in our major areas of faculty research specialization: molecular
biology/biochemistry, cell biology/biophysics, and neurobiology. Training
in these aspects of modern biology are pursued at the <B>Ph.D.</B> and
<B>M.S.</B> level. The graduate programs at SBS are part of the much broader
graduate and doctoral programs at UMKC. For information on <A HREF="sRect25.html">other options</A>
than those described here, see the <A HREF="http://www.umkc.edu/sgs">School
of Graduate Studies</A> page.</P>

<H3>Doctor of Philosophy Study</H3>

<P>The School of Biological Sciences participates in the UMKC's <A HREF="http://www.umkc.edu/catalog/gradprog/0140.html">Interdisciplinary
Ph.D. Program</A> in two disciplines: <B><A HREF="doctcbb.html">Cell
Biology and Biophysics</A></B> and <B><A HREF="doctmbb.html">Molecular
Biology and Biochemistry</A></B>.</P>

<P>The <B>Ph.D. degree training</B> is designed to prepare students for
a research-oriented career in academia or the private sector. An original,
independent research project under the supervision of a faculty adviser
is the core of this degree program. The program of study, while emphasizing
the importance of independent research under the supervision of faculty,
also provides a background of interdisciplinary coursework designed to
match the needs and interests of each student through various research
interest tracks.</P>

<P>The opportunity for research experience begins immediately as a component
of the first-year curriculum. Each student is assigned to a succession
of short research projects during the course of the academic year, working
in active research laboratories under the direction of faculty members.
These projects provide familiarity with a variety of experimental methods
employed in research and introduce students to the broad range of topics
under investigation by the faculty.</P>

<P>By the end of the first academic year, each graduate student is expected
to have achieved, through coursework, a general understanding of the basis
of molecular and cell biology. At that time, the students select faculty
research advisers and initiate active research on what will become the
topic of their doctoral dissertations. At the same time, a graduate supervisory
committee is appointed. The adviser and the committee work with the student
in selecting further graduate course training, if necessary, and monitoring
the progress of the thesis research. Committee members are chosen on the
basis of their ability to provide complementary expertise and guidance.</P>

<P>To qualify for degree candidacy, students must satisfactorily defend
an original research proposal. The culmination of the doctoral program
is the written research dissertation. In its final form, the thesis must
be approved by the graduate supervisory committee and defended in an oral
examination.</P>

<H3>Master of Science/Arts Programs</H3>

<P>In this area, the School of Biological Sciences offers programs leading
to the following degrees: </P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="sRect23.html">Master of Science in Cellular and Molecular Biology</A></LI>

<LI><A HREF="sRect29.html">Master of Arts in Biology with Nurse Anesthetist certificate option</A>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>The <B>master of science degree programs</B> involve approximately one
and one-half years of coursework; the process for selection of a faculty
adviser is similar to that in the Ph.D. track. A research project under
the supervision of a faculty adviser is required. A written thesis approved
by the student's graduate supervisory committee is also required.</P>

<P>Specific degree requirements vary among the research areas within our
doctoral or master's degree programs. Because there are no sharp divisions
in contemporary basic biological sciences, there is significant overlap
among various faculty research interest groups and academic divisions in
the School. This arrangement allows the student to examine any given research
grouping from an interdisciplinary point of view. The course requirements
allow flexible plans of study for each student's research interest with
a mandated interdisciplinary composition. In all cases, preparation for
a degree includes successful completion of a combination of coursework
and requirements established by the Office of Graduate Studies.</P>

of <A HREF="faculty.html">faculty members</A> and
is complemented by extensive interactions among the research groups in
an intellectual, stimulating academic environment of interdisciplinary
scope.</P>

<P>An extensive series of <A HREF="events.html">seminars</A>
attracts prominent scientists, encourages participation of the postdoctoral
trainees, and provides research perspectives covering contemporary cellular
and molecular biology, including biophysics and neurobiology.</P>

<P>Numerous postdoctoral assistantships that include fringe benefits such
as health and dental insurance are available. Furthermore, postdoctoral
research appointments in the School of Biological Sciences imply research
faculty status, which allows freedom to seek independent research grant
support from extramural funding agencies.</P>
