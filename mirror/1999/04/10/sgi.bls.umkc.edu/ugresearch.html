<P>The logical outcome of the existence of a strong research program at the School of Biological Sciences (SBS), which has resulted from the school's growth, first, as an eminence program and, now, a preeminence program, is the presence of a solid research environment.  This benefits undergraduate education by attracting highly qualified faculty, making research facilities and instrumentation available on campus and providing a means to financially support undergraduate research.  These assets, in turn,  are directed at integrating the process of educating students with the acquisition of new knowledge and the undergraduate curriculum of biology majors.  This capability, which only an academic unit at a research university can fully provide, is implemented in three different ways: first and foremost is through the <A HREF="saper.html"><I>Saper Vedere</I> Scholars Program</A>; second is through the Honors Program, which is intertwined with the <I>Saper Vedere</I> organization; and third, through the individual sponsorship of students' research by federal grants to individual faculty.  At SBS, financial support is associated with undergraduate research.
