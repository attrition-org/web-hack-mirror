<H3>INTRODUCTION </H3>
<P>
The purpose of this Undergraduate Programs Handbook is to familiarize
the School of Biological Sciences students and faculty with the
undergraduate programs offered by the School of Biological Sciences,
the requirements for each degree, and the various academic rules
and regulations which pertain to our students. This handbook is
by no means all-inclusive. For additional information about rules
and regulations which might apply, students are referred to the
<A HREF="http://www.umkc.edu/catalog/">UMKC General Catalog</A>.
<BR>
Be aware that rules and regulations are subject to change when
it is determined to be in the best interest of students and the
School of Biological Sciences. All changes will be conveyed to
students in a manner that is timely, permitting students to adapt
with no detrimental effects.<BR>
Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the
general and specific requirements which are applicable to their
degree. Students are also responsible for knowing the rules and
regulations contained herein, as well as in the UMKC General Catalog.
The Undergraduate advising office is available to answer questions
and assist students; however, knowledge of the requirements, rules
and regulations is ultimately the responsibility of the student.
<BR>
One final word. Requirements, courses and even prerequisites change.
We will not always be able to tell you personally about these
changes, but we will inform your advisor. Keep in touch.

</U></CENTER>
Career counselors agree:  biological sciences will be a &quot;hot&quot;
field in the 21st century.  School of Biological Sciences undergraduate
programs will prepare you for graduate or professional programs
as well as technical careers with pharmaceutical, food, agricultural
or health industries.  If you plan to teach biology, it will also
provide you with the courses you need for your subject area.<BR>
The school has a strong research mission and is focused on cellular
and molecular biology.  Outstanding laboratory equipment includes
an extensive array of modern instrumentation including an electron
microscope, X-ray diffractometer, automated oligonucleotide synthesizer,
automated DNA sequencer, peptide synthesizer, molecular graphics
workstation, an automated amino acid analyzer, confocal microscope
and many types of spectroscopes, as well as facilities for cell
culture and analysis.<BR>
The school was founded as the School of Basic Life Sciences in
1985, and became one of the 10 &quot;eminence&quot; programs established
by the University of Missouri System -- programs selected to achieve
national and international prominence.  The school soon became
nationally-known for its research.  Since it was established,
each year the school has brought in millions of dollars in outside
research funds.<BR>
In March 1992, the school, the Department of Biology and the Medical
Technology program from the College of Arts and Sciences were
joined to form the School of Biological Sciences.  The result
-- a fresh, new program with an intellectually stimulating environment
and exceptional faculty and facilities.  It's the place to get
in on the ground floor of the important work taking place in the
biological sciences.<BR>
The redefined school, which includes many of the six-year dentistry
and medicine students, is expected to have over 1000 students
this year.  The graduate program in Molecular and Cellular Biology
is the largest in the region.  The School of Biological Sciences
plays a crucial role in Marion Merrell Dow's $10 million research
partnership for studying the underlying causes of aging.<BR>
The School of Biological Sciences offers a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.)
in Biology, a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Biology and a Bachelor
of Science in Medical Technology (B.S.M.T.).  In addition, a minor
in Biological Sciences is available for students majoring in subjects
offered by other academic units.  The B.S. degree program, which
is the most intensive, is designed for students interested in
preparing for graduate study or professional schools.  The B.A.
degree program is more flexible and is designed to accommodate
students who plan to obtain minors in related departments, or
who wish to major in biology but do not plan to pursue post-graduate
study.  The School also administers the B.A. in Biology portion
of the B.A./B.A. Sec. Ed., B.A./M.D. and B.A./D.D.S. for students
who are admitted to those programs by the Schools of Education,
the School of Medicine and the School of Dentistry, respectively.
<BR>
In addition to the undergraduate programs detailed in this handbook,
the School of Biological Sciences administers programs in graduate
studies.  Graduate degrees from the School of Biological Sciences
include an Interdisciplinary Doctor of Philosophy, Master of Science
in Cellular and Molecular Biology and Master of Arts in Biology.
