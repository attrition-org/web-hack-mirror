<H1>Overview</H1>

<P>The School of Biological Sciences was established at the University
of Missouri-Kansas City on January 1, 1985. It has the primary responsibility
both for developing <I>strong research programs</I> in the modern biological
sciences and for providing <I>quality instructional programs</I> in life
sciences. The School supports the extensive health science thrust of the
University through <A HREF="gradprog.html">graduate</A>
and <A HREF="ugrdprog.html">undergraduate</A> teaching
as well as postgraduate and postdoctoral <A HREF="research.html">research</A>.</P>

<P>The creation of the School of Biological Sciences brought together existing
faculty members in basic life sciences disciplines and was augmented by
additional faculty positions and program improvement funds provided by
the state of Missouri and private <A HREF="support.html">resources</A>.
The Board of Curators of the University of Missouri, as part of a development
plan for the UMKC campus, has selected the School of Biological Sciences
as an area targeted for <I>programmatic eminence</I>. The School will maintain
state-of-the-art <A HREF="facility.html">research
instrumentation</A> and will recruit of additional <A HREF="people.html">research-active
faculty</A>. </P>

<H2>An Interdisciplinary Approach to Biological Sciences</H2>

<P>Modern biological, molecular and genetic research has altered the course
of science. The practical applications of this research to medicine, to
agriculture, to business provide new career opportunities for the future.
Modern biological sciences is the meeting ground of the converging paths
of biology, chemistry and physics, applied to achieve an understanding
of the nature and functional behavior of living systems. The spectacular
advances of the past decades in methodology and equipment have permitted
the research scientist to address questions at the cellular and molecular
levels. The techniques of molecular biology and biochemistry provide a
means of achieving an understanding of the regulation of gene expression
and the modification of macromolecular structure. The structural and functional
consequences of such changes, delineated with spectroscopic and other biophysical
and analytical approaches of increasing sophistication, provide experimental
bases for elucidating the mechanisms of life processes that were literally
unimaginable only a decade ago. This knowledge, and the development of
reliable techniques for the practical application of this information,
has permitted the establishment of biotechnology as a vibrant area for
current and future impact. </P>

<P>To prepare an individual adequately for a career in science, our research
programs provide ongoing projects in a variety of areas within the broadest
boundaries of interest and within a unifying theme of Molecular Recognition
in Biological Systems.</P>
