<P>You are cordially invited to participate in the 10th International Symposium on Vitamin B<SUB>6</SUB> and Carbonyl Catalysis and the 4th Meeting on PQQ and Quinoproteins to be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, from October 31 to November 5, 1999.  Santa Fe is the capital of the state of New Mexico.  Founded in 1610, it is the second oldest town and the oldest capital in the United States.  Santa Fe is a unique blend of English-American, Indian, and Spanish cultures nestled at 7,000 feet in the foothills of the great Rocky Mountains.  Today's Santa Fe is a community of 65,000 people and has one of the largest art markets in the world.  Around this time the average temperature range is 15<SUP>o</SUP>/0<SUP>o</SUP> C.</P>

<P><I><B>Logo (upper left): </B> Inside the pyridine ring is Mother Earth, taken from a NASA satellite photo into which molecular graphics of a transaminase and cell imaging have been incorporated.  The central figure for our Santa Fe site is based on a petroglyph of Kokopelli, &quot;the Hump-Back Flute Player.&quot;  Kokopelli appears frequently in the myth and religion of many Southwest Indian cultures. 

<P>For the Mimbres culture which flourished in New Mexico around the 12th century, he plays an important role in the creation myth, which says that mankind was originally led up into the real world by a hump-backed flute player.

<P>In Navaho religion, Kokopelli is often linked with fertility, the hump being made of clouds that contain the seeds of all vegetation.  He is also associated with the god of moisture and mist, the hump symbolizing a rainbow.  At times, he is portrayed as a mountain sheep and has supernatural control over these animals.

<P>Among the Hopi there is a Kokopelli kachina, and again, he is tied to fertility and abundance. 

<P>Kokopelli is depicted in numerous guises throughout the history of rock art in the Southwest and may be found on cave and rock walls over the western U.S. and into South America.</I>
