Ahem, Fist off ide like to say your fucking pathedic.  Why would you say that you were the first ones that 'hacked' this site? Look Here <a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/www.towngreen.com/">http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/www.towngreen.com/</a> I was the original one to compromise this domain.
<br>
Second, (-=D3n13d+Acc3s5=-) , you fucknut;  a 'hacker' does not 'hack' to damage systems like you.  If your going to do it, dont damage the damn thing.  Someone put allot of work into this domain, and they dont need your dumb ass fucking it up.
<br>
Third, UHA- get a fucking life. 
<br>
And Last, Redemption Own's You All.
