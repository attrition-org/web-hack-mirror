<br>
okay, this time im going to be serious for once.
<br>
Today, in a the suburbs of Denver CO.. two masked gunmen, opened fire in a highschool, killing dozens of harmless students, and injuring many more.
<br>
They tossed explosives, and shot at students at point blank range, laughing and enjoying it all.
<br>
This is an outrage, how can someone do this to people they knew, or dont even know? Revenge is one thing.. but hunting down, and killing dozens of innocent teenagers?

The incident at Columbine High School apparently began around lunchtime, but the shooting spree spread to the school hallway and library and possibly to the school roof, where two students said one young man was tossing grenade-like explosives. 
<br>
Two gun-toting teens were dressed in black trench coats and wearing masks, students said. 
<br>
Some said they were thought to be member of a small group of "outcasts" at the school known as the "trench coat mafia."

Parents of students rushed to the scene as heavily armed SWAT teams surrounded the school. One group of three young men dressed in dark clothing, possibly friends of the gunmen, were detained for some time by police and later released. 
<br>
Another young man later was seen being led away in handcuffs. The sheriff's department said he was not a suspect, but was being questioned because he was a known associate of the two suspected shooters. 
<br>
A school district official said school Principal Frank DeAngelis "actually saw one of the gunmen and was able to push some students into a location to protect those students." 
<br>
<br>
Think of all the cute chicks that died, its not fair.
<br>
I hope this is a reminder of how ugly our world can be.. hacking is one thing, but murder is selfish.
