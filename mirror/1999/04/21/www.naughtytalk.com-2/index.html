<p>Team Spl0it -  Haha, you are a pathetic excuse for a group.  Make this just another way of sayen, i've watched your members on many machines and you are pathetic, i own everything you do and much more, i take your roots, because your members dont' like the encrypted based daemon such as sshd, so i just sniffed your telnet sessions and laughed at your .bash_history for awhile on many machines.  You should give up now, this might start a fight between gH and spl0it, but i can base my comments on facts, because i have logs, .bash_history files i should frame for straight up lameness.  You kids need to learn to hide or maybe trojan atleast 1 thing, but you don't and you just go on, find / -name index.html and all this other funny shit.  I've found you on machines where you passed up cc#'s, huge databases with large corporations databases.  It's so pathetic i don't even wanna talk about it anymore.  I hope you just read this and fucking die and don't even try to step, because i'll fuck each and everyone one of you over 1 by 1, like a domino effect, because you are all skillLess and will fear my html and neat piss gif.  Have a nice day and train your members and read "security for dummies", because it worked wonders for gH. haah&*@^#^@#&*(@

<p>Denver and Feds -  If you haven't heard about the trench coat mafia then well, you are way behind in real news and shit.  This type of shit makes the United States of America look like Yugoslavia and shit, i mean it isn't the troops killing off our population, it is ourselves.  Our young people today are trapped in old skewl shit, thinking the mafia runs shit now, what type of shit is that.  If you weren't part of the mafia about 20 years ago or so and you think now is the time to start a mafia type organization, you are fucked up.  The laws and their bullshit about organized crime would crack down on your ass with tha quickness.  I seen no point in the shooting in Denver yesterday and will propably never understand why it turned out as it did.  I put it to everyone like this, we on the internet run the real world, we control your transactions, every data you send from one pc to another, we own.  Think of this type of shit and ask yourself "Why must the feds fuck with hackers?", but the answer is because they are scared of us.  They understand that we control the internet and not them nor any admins.  Everytime a huge system gets compromised like a military machine, you don't see it on t.v., why is this, because they don't want the public to understand they have poor network security and some private shit could be found and passed around.  They give excuses like, we kept low security to draw hackers to the network so we could catch them, *cough* bullshit *cough*.  If this was true, more hackers would get caught each day, but they aren't even smart enough to catch who they want.  Then make up huge sums of money it costed them to mv backup.html index.html, but you know how the government is, they like to suck our tax payers dollars into their pockets like a fucking money leech.  I don't understand how it can cost the government like 200k to fix a change html like some of my friends have been charged and shit.  Charges like destruction of computer property and shit, i guess it isn't a crime to hack a machine and idle then is it?  I'm not doing anything and i'm not taking up enough bandwidth to make a noticeable difference in traffic flow.  I should compromised like a huge military site and just idle with my real ip, what can i get charged with?  Show you how much of a dumb ass you are for not taking care of your network.  The networks on the internet is like a car in the parking lot.  If i leave a nice fast car in the parking lot with the doors up, someone is gonna get inside it and tamper with it and may even take it, the same with your network, you have doors (holes) open and we take it (compromise) and even some of us type of hackers/crackers fix the security hole, but still get no respect, we are labled as warriors or people who destory systems.  The government will learn one day to work with us instead of against us, cause if someone called an all out cyber war on the government and they noticed the power we had together and how much we could accomplish, they would shit in their pants........

<p>JP -  You are probably going to try to sue me over like trademark rights, but you know what?  I was reading up on trademark rights and shit.  Just because you reg a domain don't give you rights over shit containing antionline.  That is like sayen if i reg the.com and i sued everyone for using "the", you are fucking stupid JP.  You are pathetic and showed it to me last night when you were on the phone with a non-mentioned user and you asked aboug gH and said something like, "and then their is mosthated, hrmm hmm" and this user said i was on the phone and you pissed your pants.  "For future reference, please notify me of someone on the phone before we start the conversation"  You act like you said something i care about, besides the fact you pissed your pants when i ended up on the phone and you hung up on us and ran.  Don't worry about my group or myself, we are doing fine unlike you who runs the so called news site of the underground, yet you are scared to goto any con, in fear of someone punking your bitchass or stomping you until you unplugged your gay ass site's power suply.  One day JP you will understand i have no beef with you, but you start alot of shit just to get publicity and attempt to use mind control over the kids who don't hang with the underground, us real underground people who deal with this shit everyday think your site sucks elephant dick and will never capture the true ethics of how everything works, because even yourself still to this moment don't understand that you aren't shit to us.

<p><font size="2" color="red">BIG FUCK YOUS TO: Every war/packet group on efnet, you have no skill and half of you i have noticed don't even understand how the dos you use works and thinks it effects every OS and shit, itz really amusing to sit on a bsd box and watch myself get scanned and then hit with slice or an oob attack or scanned for netbus.  #nbh on efnet, you are all skillLess kids on my dick.  Undernet opers, why don't you just close down the shit, itz pointless, time consuming and full of elite script kids who dos your servers and practically have you admins by the balls, ex. pWr.  And the middle finger to you kid groups who don't respect other groups and thier accomplishments.  If you don't know shit about a group, don't talk shit about it unless you base your statements on facts, not jealousy
