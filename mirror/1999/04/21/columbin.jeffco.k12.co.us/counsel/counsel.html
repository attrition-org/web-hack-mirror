  <P>Peer Counseling is a program designed to allow students to talk with others their own age
   about a variety of issues.  There are two peer counselors available in the counseling office
    every hour who have been trained to handle these different issues.  Students are encouraged
	 to come and address their concerns with the peer counselors on their free period.</P>
	 <P>The Counselors can receive email at <a href="mailto:peers@imaginemail.com">peers@imaginemail.com</a>.  They are able to answer
	 questions on any issue you might have.</P>

<DIV id="kim" class="textLayer" style="visibility: hidden">
<DIV class="sectionTitle"><p>kim</p></DIV>
<P>Hi my name is Kimberly Lorenz.
  I became a peer counselor because I love helping people and I wanted to make a difference
  in our high school. My other activities at CHS include being a member of the National Honor Society
  and the captain of the Poms squad.<IMG ALIGN="left" name="kim_pic" SRC="../images/dot.gif" WIDTH=227 HEIGHT=108 ALT="Picture of Kim">
  I have been a pom for two years and I was a JV cheerleader
  before that.  Between doing homework, practicing, going to games and planning activities for
  peer counseling I don't have very much free time.  When I do find some time for myself I enjoy
  working out, hanging out with my friends, and drawing.  I have a small family of four including
  a little sister named Melissa who is a freshman this year.  I am going to attend the University of
  Colorado in Boulder next school year.  I can't wait for the freedom of living on my own and handling
  my own life.  I plan to try out for Express next year, which is the pom squad at CU.  I am not
  positive about what I want to do for a career but I am thinking about something in marketing or
  psychology.</P>
  <P>	I think our peer-counseling program is a really great way for students to get help from people
  that know more about problems they may be having.  I hope that I can help as many people as possible
  this year!</P>
</DIV>

<DIV id="tammy" class="textLayer" style="visibility: hidden">
<DIV class="sectionTitle"><p>tammy</p></DIV>
<P>Hi!  My name is Tammy and I am here to help you.  <IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" name="tammy_pic" SRC="../images/dot.gif" WIDTH=156 HEIGHT=94 ALT="picture of Tammy">
  I enjoy going to the movies and anything that deals
  with the outdoors.  I have played softball since I was five years old and I also run track.  I love to go
  rollerblading and mountain biking on the weekends.  I also like to go snowboarding in the winter.  Some
  of my favorite movies are Titanic (which is my favorite of all time), Meet Joe Black, Ace Ventura, Dumb
  and Dumber, Shakespeare in Love, Patch Adams, She's All that, Saving Private Ryan, and GI Jane, only to
  list a few.  Just in case anyone was wondering I don't like the movies just because of the actors (i.e.
  Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt).  My favorite actor and actress of all time are Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock.</P>
  <P>My family life is pretty normal.  I have a younger sister and one mother and father.  I have Jack
  Russell Terrier named Fireball.  We get along most of the time, even though my sister is a freshman this
  year and she gets on my nerves sometimes.  We moved to Colorado four years ago from San Diego.  I was a
  freshman at the time and it was one of the most devastating times of my life.</P>
  <P>My school life is pretty normal also.  I take two AP classes and Calculus is the hardest class I have
  ever taken in my life.  My college plans are a little bit different than most people because I have
  enlisted in the Navy and I hopefully will get an ROTC scholarship so I can go to college and not pay
  for it.  Looking back on high school I am almost glad it is over and I can move on.  I am going to miss
  the people that I have met and am friends with but I'm glad that I am going to meet new people next year.
  The one piece of advice that I could give to any high school student is to always work hard even when you
  think that it is not going to take you anywhere. Believe me, when your senior year comes and you can't get
  into a college because you slacked off your freshman year you are going to be kicking yourself.  Other than
  that high school was a wonderful experience and I sure am going to miss it but I am happy to be moving on.</P>
  <P>The reason that I became a counselor was first of all that I wanted to help others, but it was also
  because I wanted to dig into myself and figure what kind of person I am.  Before I became a peer counselor
  I didn't truly know who I was.  While I was being trained to counsel others I realized things about myself
  that I had never paid attention to before.  I learned to look more deeply in the things that were bothering
  me and figure out the root of where my anger and frustration came from.  I am now able to better perceive
  people's emotions by the signals and mannerisms they send out.  With this "talent" I notice things that
  people are trying to tell me about myself but they're not actually saying it.  This has taught me a lot
  and I hope to one day pursue the counseling aspect of life even if it is not professionally. </P>
</DIV>

<DIV id="ross" class="textLayer" style="visibility: hidden">
<DIV class="sectionTitle"><p>ross</p></DIV>
<P>Hey, I'm Ross.  In my free time I mostly just like to relax and hang out with friends.  I love doing things on the
  net, and I  also enjoy music, movies and TV.  Some of my favorite musicians are Orgy, Janet Jackson, Rufus Wainwright
  and Sugar Ray.</P>
  <P>  I have a younger brother who is a sophomore at Columbine, and I live right by the school.  I have only lived in this
  area for four years, but I have lived in Colorado my entire life.
  <IMG ALIGN="right" name="ross_pic" SRC="../images/dot.gif" WIDTH=302 HEIGHT=93 ALT="Picture of Ross">
  However, I do enjoy traveling to places like Hawaii,
  Las Vegas, California and Texas when time and money permit.</P>
  <P>I currently have 7 classes, including AP English, AP History and Newspaper and as of first semester this year I still
  have a 4.0 GPA.  I plan on either going to CU at Denver, UNC or Denver Tech after Columbine.</P>
  <P>I decided to become a peer counselor for several reasons.  Most of all I feel that I am a good listener and I can help
  other people by giving them an outlet for what they want to talk about.  I also wanted to get 
more involved in school since I had not been involved in too many things up to my senior year.  I, along with the others,
have learned many valuable skills and insights into human feelings and behavior, as well 
as learning more about myself. </P>
<P>Feel free to come by and see me during 7th hour if you have anything you want to talk about.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV id="krissa" class="textLayer" style="visibility: hidden">
<DIV class="sectionTitle"><p>krissa</p></DIV>
<P>Hi! My name is Krissa Eggert!  I am a peer counselor at Columbine High School, and I am a senior.  I am involved in
many activities at CHS; my favorite is track.  I have gone to
<IMG align="left" name="krissa_pic" SRC="../images/dot.gif" WIDTH=190 HEIGHT=101 ALT="Picture of Krissa">
CHS all four years and I have run for four years also.
I am involved in as many activities as I can because I feel it is really important to be involved in your school.  Because
I have participated in many activities, I have had the chance to meet a lot of diverse people!  When I am not at school,
I find myself working out, hanging out with friends and family or just relaxing.  I love to try new things and because of
that I have had many unique and exciting experiences.  I love to be around a lot of people and I feel the best when I am
around a lot of people (I think my personality feeds on it ).  Next year I am planning on attending a four-year University
in Texas, majoring in Occupational or Physical therapy.  </P>
<P>I wanted to become a peer counselor because since I was a little girl my dream was to help others.  When I heard that by
 becoming a peer counselor I could help others and make a difference in our school, I jumped at the opportunity; plus I get
 to meet a lot of new people.  Since I have become a peer counselor I have had the opportunity to make new friends, become a
  better listener, and improve my family and friend relationships.  I feel I am a very good listener and an easy person to
  talk to.  I, along with many others have had a not-so-perfect life, so I can relate first hand about what goes on in a
  teenagers mind.  I feel confident that if you were to come and talk to me that I would be very helpful. I am in the peer
  counseling office Monday through Friday 2nd hour, from 8:25-9-20.  So come and talk to me, I am here to listen and learn
  from you!  Hope to see you soon! </P>
</DIV>

<DIV id="kerri" class="textLayer" style="visibility: hidden">
<DIV class="sectionTitle"><p>kerri</p></DIV>
<P>Hi, my name is Kerri and I am here to help you.   First of all, I would describe myself as
an understanding and
<IMG name="kerri_pic" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="../images/dot.gif" WIDTH=155 HEIGHT=123 ALT="Picture of Kerri">
outgoing individual.  I love to help anyone with their problems.  The
peer counselors are probably the best group of people in all of Columbine.  We are
understanding and will help you with anything you need.</P>
<P>I play soccer at Columbine and I've played soccer for almost fifteen years.  It takes up
most of my time, but I make time for extra things.   I was on junior varsity my freshman year
and from my sophomore year on I've been on varsity.  It has been a great experience. My team
went to the state finals last year and lost, but this year I think we have a good chance of
taking it all the way.</P>
</DIV>


<DIV id="val" class="textLayer" style="visibility: hidden">
<DIV class="sectionTitle"><p>val</p></DIV>
<P>Hey! My name is Val! I became a peer counselor because I enjoy working with other people.  I had also
hoped itwould give me some insight into the counseling profession.  Through this program I have met many
new students from this school, as well
<IMG name="val_pic" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="../images/dot.gif" WIDTH=99 HEIGHT=113 ALT="Picture of Val">
 as seniors in my class that I did not know very well.  I have
enjoyed being a part of this program because I have learned more about who I am as a person.  Besides
being a peer counselor, I am an active member of National Honor Society and in the past have been a
member of Key Club.  Both of these activities I have enjoyed because of all the community service we do.
On a more personal level, outside of  school, I hold a job where I work six days a week which keeps me
very busy.  When I'm not running around, I enjoy hiking and working out. I also enjoy messing around with
my two three year old dogs, Kodiak and Koa Kai.  They are the best friends a person could have. When I
have spare time, I love to travel.  I have been all over the States with my family and have been on my
own to visit England, Italy and France. It was the best experience because I learned and experienced
other cultures along with some of my friends. My favorite thing to do when I'm on my own is listen to
music. I like Dave Matthews, Jewell, The Beatsie Boys, and V.A.S.T. </P>
<P>When I graduate, I am planning to go to University of Northern Colorado in Greeley.  I hope to teach
for a couple of years. Then I am considering going back to school and get my masters in guidance
counseling so that I can continue working with students just on a different level.  Right now, I am
available in the counseling office during 4th hour if you need to talk or have any questions.  I look
forward to your visit!!!</P>

Hello! My name is Angela.  I am the eldest of four girls.  I am 
close to my family and love doing the silly family outings every 
once in awhile.  I know what it is like to be dished out a lot of 
pressure from family due to the fact that I am my sisters' role 
model.  I enjoy going to the movies and anything that deals with 
the outdoors. I especially like to go skiing because I truly love the mountains. </P>
<P>My sisters are 12, 14,  and 16.  Melanie is also a student here, 
she is a sophomore JV Cheerleader.  Christa goes to Ken Caryl Middle 
School and is in the 8th grade.  She is an awesome ballerina.  Kaylee 
is a 6th grader at Dutch Creek Elem.  She is a talented and strong gymnast.  
</P>
<P>I currently am a member of the yearbook staff, NHS and am in AP
English.  I love to write and to find depth in things.  I am always 
searching for ways to solve my problems and seek advice from friends 
and family.  I like to learn from people and from my experiences. 
 I have been on various trips and find that hands-on experiences 
are the best way to get to know yourself.</P>
<P>I am fairly involved in school functions and met not only a lot
of students here that way, but also met a lot of the faculty in 
the process.  On the first day of school I had to go to the counseling 
office because there were problems in my schedule.  I was a scared 
freshman and the whole idea seemed scary to me.  The counselors 
were very nice to assist me and I felt comfortable there.  I also 
met some of the peer counselors when I was in middle school, so 
needless to say, I knew more about them then most people did my 
freshman year.  It has always been my dream to help even one person 
through their troubles.  I love working with people and I currently 
hold a job as an afterschool/daycare provider at Shaffer Elementary 
School.  I love to talk and am always ready to listen.</P>

<P>HI guys! My name is Alison Brock. I'm just going to tell you all a little bit about myself.
<IMG name="alyson_pic" align="left" SRC="../images/dot.gif" WIDTH=107 HEIGHT=193 ALT="Picture of Alyson">
Please restrain from laughing while you read this if you're in the library.</P>
<P> So I'll start with hobbies
I have. I really enjoy bowling (I actually bowl a 90, which is pretty good for me!) and going
to skateparks with friends. Mostly though I like hanging with my friends, even if we just sit
and do nothing. Movies are pretty fun to go to with friends. Some really good ones (if you want
a good laugh) would be Austin Powers, Monty Python and the Search for the Holy grail, and Robin
Hood: Men in Tights. I'm an outside person so I really like to be in the mountains doing mountainy
things, like snowboarding, snowshoeing, mountain biking, rock climbing, repelling, etc. I like
this whole long list just cuz being outside is like being stress free (unless I'm falling or
something) and just being myself without any worries of anyone making fun of me. You know what
 I mean?</P>
 <P>The reason I became a peer counselor was because I wanted to help people out with trials
 they were facing, and I wanted to find out more about myself (yup it really helps out when
 you have rough times in your life) and it just seemed like a fun thing to do. Plus a good
 way to meet new people in all grades.</P>

<P>Hi!  My name is Steve Vaughan and I am here to listen to anything you want to talk about.  First,
let me tell you a little bit about myself.  I have two sisters.  Molly is a sophomore at CHS and Keely
is an 8th grader at Ken Caryl.  I  have a dog named Shawnee and a fish named Smithers.   I enjoy
listening to music, singing, playing hockey, and hanging out with friends.  I also like to make movies,
although I am not very good at it.  Some of my favorite movies include Schinder's List, Saving Private
Ryan, There's Something About Mary, and Swingers.
 <IMG name="steve_pic" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="../images/dot.gif" WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=95 ALT="Picture of Steve">
 My all-time favorite director is Steven Speilberg
and my favorite actor is Tom Hanks.  Some of my favorite bands include The Barenaked Ladies, Dave
Matthews Band, Collective Soul, and Blues Traveler.  I don't get a chance to watch too much television
but when I do I love to watch the Simpsons. I love that show!!! I am a member of National Honor
Society and have participated in all four musicals.  Freshman year I was Motel in Fiddler on the Roof.
Sophomore year I was Albert Peterson in Bye Bye Birdie.  Last year I was Harold Hill in Music Man and
this year I was Will Parker in Oklahoma.  I love performing on stage because it relieves stress and
allows me to step into someone else's shoes for awhile.  Next year I plan on going to Creighton
University in Omaha, Nebraska.  I want to major in elementary school education and minor in music.
Overall, I am really looking forward to moving on with my life but I will miss some aspects of high
school, such as my friends.  It is really important to appreciate your friends while they are around
 you because you never know when they'll be gone for good.  I urge anyone to come into the counseling
 office during 3rd hour and we'll talk about anything you want.  I am here for you.
