<h1><i>electronic</i><br>Workshops in Computing</h1>
<h3>The journal of leading-edge workshops in computing science</h3>
<p>
Series editor: <b>C. J. van Rijsbergen</b>, University of Glasgow
</center>
<p>
The <i>electronic</i> Workshops in Computing (eWiC) series is published by the British Computer Society.
It is international in scope. 
<p>
Each publication is based on the proceedings of a specialist workshop and is designed to provide information that represents a "snapshot" of current knowledge, debate, or research.
It covers the broadest possible range of topics - subject only to the workshops being firmly established in computing and being of interest to the wider community.
Each title in the series has an associated abstract booklet, which can be ordered electronically, or bought through standard outlets.
<p>
The full papers and multimedia resources of a workshop are provided on this website - access to which is gained by providing information contained within an abstract booklet, or by providing a "Payment Code".  A Payment Code can be obtained by making a credit card payment on the eWiC customer helpline.
<p>
<hr>

<p>
<b>Free access to abstracts</b><br>
You are free to browse throught the workshops and read the abstracts of individual papers.
Access to the full text of the papers (and associated sounds/images etc) is by subscription only.
Each workshop displays both it's normal subscription price and the discounted price for BCS members.
<p>
<b>Subscription access to full papers</b><br>
An eWiC account will provide you with a single username and password to access all the workshops to which you have subscribed.
This gives you the full papers in both Acrobat and Postcript formats, along with any associated resource materials (e.g. sounds, images, movies, datafiles, etc.).
Additionally, you will soon be able to register a machine from which you regularly access eWiC, and have transparent password-free access from that machine.
<a href="/ewic/account/new.cfm">create an account</a>
<p>
<b>Transfer of old booklet-based subscriptions</b><br>
If you own one of the old booklets that were previously used to access the full papers of workshops, you can use that subscription to create one of the new username/password accounts.
Grab your booklet, and <a href="/ewic/account/new.cfm">create an account</a><p>
<b>Site subscriptions</b><br>
Transparent password-free access from all machines in a given sub-domain is available for use by, for example, libraries or other organisations.  Please <a href="contact.cfm">contact us</a> to discuss this.
