This hosting service was hit by GH and changed with the following message:
<a href="first/index.html">First Change</a>

After more exploration, they determined there was a lot more there and redesigned
the hacked page to show how insecure the domain was, and the consequences
that would ensue. This included finding illegal software, Denial of Service utilities,
and banking information.
