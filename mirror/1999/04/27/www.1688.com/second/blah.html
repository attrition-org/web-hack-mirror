Note From MostHateD:
	This has been rather amusing.  First of all, if you wish to notify some officials i would check your HD's and make sure everything you own is legal and registered in your name.  Got you thinking doesn't it?  I found numorous warezed programs with cracks such as DU, which was a traffic moniter which costs $15 which i know you could spare since you run this webhosting company.  But now you have dug yourself in a hole in which you can't get out.  I kind of think stealing and using warezed programs is a bit worse then to change a simple html.  You have more crack directorys then a warez kid on aol.  I mean everything you run, has a \crack\ directory with a registration number and everything you need.  That isn't even the most amusing part of this whole ordeal.  Do you understand that Denail Of Service is a federal offence?  In c:\utility i beleive i grabbed a NUKE program off your machine as well with router logs of you sending OOB stings to ips.  Why would an admin use a winNuke type program when that is against the law?  You are probably thinking, how did he get router logs, well on the K: HD i found a file with router information and the passwd to the router, which can be found [here].  All this illegal stuff and no legitiment reason for it.  You have a job, but you warez, you have a fast connection on a frame relay network, yet you choose to winnuke and then out of pure stupidity you leave the router passwd on your machine with out being encrypted, how pathetic, how did you make it to this level, warezed your way through aol?  I hope you aren't mad, but you need to check your holes in your system and stop the illegal shit or this would have never happened.  Learn to make friends and do right, not make foes and do wrong.  Whole ordeal dedicated to the Domination of gH in 1999.  Happy Hacking.......
