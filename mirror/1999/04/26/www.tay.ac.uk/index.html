<h2>A Changing World</h1>
<br>
<br>
Society is just a state of mind. A state in which you are oppressed by those of whom protect and control society. You can free yourself with a simple word, but you can choose not to in fear of becoming an outlander. These outlanders, which lay underground, are working against you. They are fighting for a reason that you believe is non-existent. A right in which you believe that you have but deep down inside know that is not possible. You may try to join them but you will not understand what they are fighting for. 
For all of your life you have been mislead and manipulated by these so called protectors of society. It is impossible for you to think you rely on your superiors to think for you.
<br><br><br>
Is there a way out ? Is there a way to take control of something you have sworn to others in order to become something which you know is impossible? Yes, there is a way out. Every man, or woman has the potential to gain control of that one thing that they lack. I cannot tell you what you need to know, for I am the owner of <b>my</b> life and <b>my</b> soul. It is up to YOU to decide what it is. You have your <b>own</b> mind. Use it. Free yourself. Take back what is rightfully yours and look at the world around you.
Look at how these inhuman people have destroyed us.&nbsp;&nbsp;
