on #wrestling---------
mr.x: hah have any negative words about 1wrestling?
carlh: Nah, nothing in particular:) Or atleast that I can say.  I have some, but i'll hold them back:) 

mr.x: what do you think of wcws new turn
carlh: I like some of what they are doing (letting the cruiserweights work tremendous matches), but don't like some of the other shit.

mr.x: like what?
carlh Giving the belt back to Page during the Main Event.  Load of horse shit.

mr.x: what about wwf's turn to more drama
carlh: Don't care for it.  If I want t&a i'll see the real thing, not watch made-for-tv versions of it.

mr.x: waiting for bischoff to come back?
carlh: No, I didn't care for Bischoff's booking.

mr.x: what do you want to see in the future?
carlh: I want to see new people, or atleast people worth giving it to hold the WCW Title... and the WWF needs 
       to do something about their Main Event roster as there is only so much you can do with Austin vs. Mankind, 
       Austin vs. The Rock, and Austin vs. The Undertaker and all those feuds have been played out entirely too much.

mr.x: may i publish this chat?
mr.x: in its raw form
carlh: I don't mind...

<tt><b>well.. both promotions are comming off another interesting night of werstling. personally.. this hack is dedicated
 to sting jobbing the one thing he deserves the most. why is it that wrestling doesnt seemt to give the people 
what they want these days. i do like the new rout that WCW is taking and i urge all of you to give WCW the support 
that it deserves right now. remember what wrestling is about...  wrestling. WWF is going way to far, right here... 
right now i urge everyone that sees this to tune there dials to a promotion that seems to remember what its all about.
