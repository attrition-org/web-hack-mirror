<p>sleepness nights, restless soul, forever bourdened with people ive seen
in a dream within a dream, telling me why im here, for that only reason,
I am bourdened.&nbsp;

<p>There are times when i want to shout obscenities at the top of my lungs.
Deprecations even.
<br>There are times i'm an intense dot of self-isolation. Sometimes the
day is filled with anonymous people who walk by, and ludicrously hand me
fat black pens, to draw that dot bolder and darker.

<p>i cant live

<br>&nbsp;
<p>people who helped me over the years of this beautiful network we call
the internet. You need to be praised, you put time of your life into what
you called ne0h.&nbsp;

<p>Well, here i am. i'm finally doing it. Finally writing this. To the
amorphous out there, to you.&nbsp;
<p>You tell me im not good enough to be here? You tell me what I can and
can not do, you tell me what ive done, I tell you want I cant do.
<p>trance, confusion of it all, death, pain, suffering from this disease
known as you.
<p>i'm a hacker. Sometimes i feel i've tattooed my identity with that label.
So that's why i'm here, talking to you. i'm taking a break from this network
of imbisiles, sodomists, and procrastinaters. But it's more complex than
a procrastination trip. Something else needs to be born.&nbsp;
<p>i hacked websites for what? you. I hacked them for the things I belive
I can do, for the admins, for their time. You need to get paid, but you
need somehting to do first. Give a helping hand, learn from what has been
done to you. Do unto others of what has been done to you. You have lost
in this battle known as security, you are futile before me.&nbsp;
<p>time and work has been put into these sites, time and money has it brought
to you? No. your imagination has gone and wandered off, you now know what
has been done to you, you cant stop it from happening, you know you cant
win, i am sorry.
<br>im sorry, but you dont know what im about, you dont know why I fully
did what I did, you cant be me, you cant see what I see, you cant feel
what I feel, stop trying to justify the wrong.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>So i sit here on my chair, thinking of what I have done, and why I did
it, you have fallen
<br>... I beat you to it.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i><font color="#FFFFFF">I am running from you, you wont find me.</font></i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>And now I watch you, what you have created.. I cry at your failures,
I laugh when you know it.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Collapsed from inner torture, how can you live this way? Shuffling for
relief, you wont find it here..
<p>Pain of lonliness, killing in the name of something that does not hear
your cries. You are greedy for the things you already have, and forgetful
of the things you desire.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>We're all stars now, in the fake show. Dont belive in this, you wont
succeed. Drama of emptiness, clinging on to the thin white wire that brings
out your faith. You will die a lonely soul, if you dont give it away.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Exploding hate for someone you dont know, search, and you wont find
it. Your pain has found your mind, your going to loose.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Insane eyes follow the path, horror of the world, tell him...
<br>Tell who?
<br>Him.. Tell him how you really feel.
<br>No. You wont find me here.&nbsp;</td>
