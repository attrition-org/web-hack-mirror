Shouts: newbies, <a href="http://www.p3ni5.8m.com">P3N15 CreW</a>, irc.psychic.com *sniff*
it was fun :(

Screw You: posers.

Special Note to <font color="white">DARKCORE</font>: If you are me, as you pose, would you
please tell all how you:<br>
1. beat syskey remotely (hint: not brute force)<br>
2. spawned a remote DOS shell<br>
3. did this while the network monitor was logged in?
<p>
If you can't answer, don't pretend to be me. It's not nice. I dislike slamming people, but
posing is far, far from hacking. For one thing, you boast my UNIX skills; I'm strictly NT.
