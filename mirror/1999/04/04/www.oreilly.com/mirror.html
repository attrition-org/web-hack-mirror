 Brother Mandalo explains: <p>
 
 On April 1st, 1998, Jason Mewhiney was arrested by the RCMP for allegedly defacing the NASA web page: http://www.hq.nasa.gov.  This arrest was originally attributed by the press to a 3 year investigation by the RCMP/FBI. Nothing could be further by the t

ruth.  In actual truth, this arrest was the result of hearsay coming from a 20 year old paid informant by the name of Nick Potkay (whose phone # incidentally is: (203) 746-0734).  It's nice that the FBI can make arrests in Canada based upon the word of a 

socially inept kid such as Nicholas Potkay isn't it? <p>
 
 This is your wake up call, we are making a declaration of war against all who would challenge the freedom of Canadians with such ludicrous actions!  We have broken into your phone companies, your breweries; everything you hold sacred!  And we will contin

ue to defile corporate Canadian privacy until the bullshit agendas of the Yanks are cast aside and realized for what they are! <p>
 
 Let us examine for just a moment the bullshit tactics of NASA:<p>
 
 The hack done at Nasa was merely a change to ONE file in the html directory, index.html and NASA claims it took over 200 man hours for them to correct this situation. Are we to believe that it takes 200 hours for a team of NASA employees to reinstall one

 computer and re-install the contents of that box from tape backup?  These numbers are totally arbitrary. If these numbers are accurate, then it is not so difficult to imagine how a tragedy such as the Challenger explosion could occur! <p>
 
 Your friendly neighbourhood "rocket scientists" at NASA are obviously fabricating these numbers in order to get the FBI to pursue Jason Mewhiney. Seventy-four thousand dollars to issue a couple of commands and replace the altered page? The calculators at

 NASA must have the zero key stuck or something. Seventy-four dollars perhaps, but seventy-four thousand? The painful reality is this:Jason is obviously a scapegoat for NASA's inability to secure their so called "critical" web site. <p>

 Finally, some parting words from Brother Mandabarb:<p>
 
 And so we come to an end of our diatribe. I hope you have enjoyed our spectacle. Remember -- in the future, question what your read. But most of all, phear -- For the Yorkshire Posse hath arrived.<p>
