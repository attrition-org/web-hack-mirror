<p><b>How does it feel...</b></p>
<p>How does it feel to be betrayed, to be neglected, to be punished severely when no damage has been done ?
How does it feel to wake up one morning and realize that everything you've ever done in your entire life has
vanished into thin air ? How does it feel to live in a <font color="red"><b>communist</b></font> country ?</p>
<p>Us westerners cannot see that there are countries on the other side of the world, that don't live the way 
we live. Our life of luxury, of freedom, of self-realisation is merely a dream for these people. These people's
only luxury is their existance, their freedom is the one opposed by a government so tyrannical that it absorbes
everything into the system what it can, their self-realisation is non-existant because of the thought control
imposed upon them by the government.</p>
<p>How is it possible that we have let it come so far. This form of government reaches further then only inside
the boundries of China. This reaches beyond the comprehension of every single living soul on the face of this
earth. We are talking about a full deniability of the basic truths of life which include life itself, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness. From birth, we are all, without any prejudice, endowed with certain unalienable rights
that cannot be taken away from us. Any attempt to do so would not only be a crime against the citizens of a country
or state, but it would be a crime against the entire population of this planet. Therefore it is not only their problem,
but it is also ours. We cannot let this slip by asif it does not concern us, it does!</p>
<p>Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any
hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.</p>
<p>Communism on itself is not a bad idea, but it just won't work. As proven before in the former Soviet Union, and
now in China, every attempt made to make the communistic theory into reality has <b>always</b> turned out into
tyranny. Some people <b>always</b> want more power then others. In a communistic system, it is not the people who
fail, but it is the government. Even division of goods and powers, on which all socialistic systems, including communism,
are based have failed just because of this. The equality which made these nations great, is now bringing them down. Because
some people think they have more power and are better then others. Out here in cyberspace, we are all the same, no skincolor,
no nationality. This is what makes us great, this is what makes us equal.</p>
