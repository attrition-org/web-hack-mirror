<p>Team Spl0it -  No replys to tha post from last and i figured that from the begining.  A war with you would be like taking candy from a baby or even breaking a hoe off for her first time.  Either we'll come on top right off the bat or we'll have to work to take you down, but never the less we'll win.  I've seen post from team spl0it along time ago and i used to follow a few of their sloppy hackers and just figured they would die out after the imapd days were over, but i seem to have been wrong, seeing they are still around.  I would appreciate a bit of respect in a territory you have no place being.  For one, you are a sloppy hacking group who dont' fix anything you have done.  Exploiting boxes after boxes for the simple fact to use them as trash to get caught on, never thinking someone could easily be folowing them around, just sitting and watching.  No respect for hackers nor crackers due to the fact, they aren't on that level.  Echoing non-passwd logins to the system with root permissions, not even attempting to hide from anything.  The first thing you should be taught besides exploiting mass ammounts of networks, is how to fix how you got in.  If you did this from the begining then maybe you wouldn't be known round the globe as a shitty pathetic un-experienced group of kids.  If you want to step to us in any way or atleast admit and come out sayen you don't want a fight/war and it'll be stopped.  But you are like kids who need to get a whooping atleast once to learn not to do something.  This right here is your whooping, learn from it.  But on a nicer note, enjoy the page discuss how we own you and smoke a blunt or joint to get high to this bomb ass herb site's new html.  Most of you are probably high right now, tripping, but still trying to type straight.  Keep toking, learn to stop choking and never stop smoking...

<p>Denver -  This is gonna be a bit long and i figured i would let you know before hand.  I feel for the people and Denver and my love goes out to every parent out their now that has to sleep another night with once less child.  My full support goes out to you and the rest that was involved in this ordeal.  The weird thing is that people are stereo typing half of this issue, saying that the internet was apart of it or that this was targeted on people in particular.  Why is the media so hard in trying to plant the reason on stupid shit and try to give a bad name to something just to get the readers hyped up.  Obviously, it's over now, the shooters are dead and nothing will resolve as a defenant answer.  Leave it at that and stop bringing it up every 5 minutes and having these familys which lost children this week have to see or hear constantly.  It's bad enough they have to go through something like this, but to hear about it everywhere you go and see it on everything you watch.  It's pathetic how you don't think about how the family's feel about all these stories streching the truth and shit.  Call it media or call it what you want, but it's nothing but a heartless soap opra yet deals with real life issues.  Gaining and using bad happenings as ratings for them, doing big storys on shit that should be kept to the family and shit.  Just is this my opinion and most of you will probably think that my opinion doesn't count and bla bla bla.  My opinions get expressed about as much as it possibly can on the place everyone goes.  The internet, people feel this is a bad thing for our kids and will root their brain.  Well, you learn alot more things on the internet then you ever will in school.  Half the things in school you won't use in anything in the future, yet on the internet, you use the current knowledge of learn the upcomming knowledge to be preparred.  Actually learning stuff you will actually use in the future, stuff you will remember and grow more towards it's usage.  The worst thing on the internet is actually the media underground, snooping around and trying to make a big story out of nothing.  Nothing major down here happens, you don't understand the underground scene so keep your nose out of it.  Just how i feel i suppose, but we are here to stay, so do what you wish, i can't stop you, but i can state my opinion where i can and when i want.  To wrap this up, Denver familys i support and so do millions of millions of others, we feel and share you pain.....

<p>About this site -  This is actually a china site for herbs and i noticed some nice things on this page.  I might get me some chinese herbs and be happy, but this domains hosting company is to blaim for this.  Make sure you email them and tell them their security sucks and might want to be given some free months of hosting for their mistake.  Just a thought for the clients.  I kinda like herb, because i makes me feel less pressured.  I know some people are high right now on the internet just tripping over nothing.  It's all good and keep smoking and one day it'll be legalized someone hear you instead of overseas and up in Canada.  Smoke it how you want and stay high.  I give the big middle finger to our government who has taken gods own doing which was set here to help where it's stated written in the middle.  "God put herbs on earth to help man kind." Btw, Cypress Hill i love you for that, I say if you smoke, you have god's right which overpowers any law made by anyone.  Say what you wish, but god is correct.  Hehehe, you admins fix up your shit, work on firewalling and trip wiring your systems and maybe you wouldn't have these problems.  Take care.

<p>Nato -  Ask Nastrodmous (spelling?) what this war will end in.  Could this be the war he stated would begin on june/july and be the begining of the end, lasting 30 years, killing off our own population ourselves.  Just Something to think about.

Team spl0it and all it's affiliates who are pathetic newbies of the such, antionline for trying to talk shit behind my back, crak- on efnet, just because we owned you so so badly and anyone else who hates on another group for no reason, but jealousy.
