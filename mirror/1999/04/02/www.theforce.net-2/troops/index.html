<p>



<h3 align="center"><font color="#ff0000" face="ARIAL">WELCOME TO THEFORCE.NET</font></h3>



<p><font face="ARIAL">



	If you've arrived here from CNN or somewhere else on the web, we'd like to invite 



	you click on the "TF.N MAIN" button



	to the left to visit theForce.net, the most complete news and information on



	everything in the Star Wars galaxy... including everything you could want to know about the



	upcoming prequels.



</font></p>






<h3 align="center"><font color="#ff0000" face="ARIAL">PLEASE READ THIS FIRST</font></h3>







<p><font face="ARIAL">We've been getting lots of mail regarding TROOPS.&nbsp; We wanted to



make it clear that, we, TheForce.net staff, didn't create TROOPS. Our role is to host the



digitized clips of Troops on TheForce.net, and other TROOPS related material.&nbsp; All we



did was create the TROOPS site. : )&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000"><font face="ARIAL">The



film itself was created by Kevin Rubio</font>, and his creative team</font>. <font



face="ARIAL">For more information, see the &quot;credits&quot; page (click on



&quot;credits&quot; on the menu at the left). We should also note that Kevin is not on the



recipients list when you email TheForce.net.&nbsp; If you mail



&quot;starwars@theforce.net&quot;, that goes to the staff members here, but not to Kevin.



&nbsp;&nbsp; We've been forwarding all relevant messages to Kevin.&nbsp; Now that all that



is cleared up... Enjoy Kevin Rubio's &quot;TROOPS&quot;, courtesy of TheForce.net!</font></p>



<HR>



<h3 align="center"><font color="#ff0000" face="ARIAL">QUICK TROOPS TRIVIA</font></h3>







<p><font face="ARIAL">Here's some answers to commonly asked questions we get.  For more, see the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions):





<P>It's OK to distribute TROOPS as long as it's not done for profit.  That keeps Lucasfilm happy and Kevin Rubio and friends out of legal trouble.  If you see bootleggers or other individuals selling copies, we'd love to hear about it!  It's not fair for them to make money off the TROOPS team's hard work and it's also illegal.





<P>No, the costumes aren't for sale, and they can't tell you how to make them.  The costumes were made by professional Hollywood artists who wore them to conventions and even the Star Wars Special Edition premiere.  They also happened to be Kevin Rubio's friends, and he asked them to wear them for the film.  They are custom made, so you're on your own if you want one!









<P>A sequel is in the works.  See <a href="http://theforce.net/cgi-bin/tfn.cgi?action=getstory&storyID=1529">this news story</a> for the information we have on it so far.







<P>The voice of Wakko from The Animaniacs, Jess Harnell, is the voice of one of the Troopers.  Cam Clark, the voice of Leonardo the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle and Die Fledermaus from The Tick, is the voice of the Fargo-accented Captain Bach.

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><big><strong>A MESSAGE KEVIN RUBIO</strong></big></font></p>







<p><font face="Arial">March 21, 1998</font></p>







<p><font face="Arial">To Everyone:</font></p>







<font face=arial>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you've taken the time to sit at your computer and call up this page,



it's probably because you caught the article in the Entertainment Weekly



"Oscar" issue. Although quite a boost to my already inflated ego, it



failed to highlight the many other talented people who worked on this



film.</p>







<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TROOPS is as good as it is because of all the individuals who worked on



it. From Steve Melching and Dave Hard Grove (who first came up with the



idea) to Shant Jordan and Patrick Perez ( whose effects gave TROOPS its



incredible look) to Eric Hilleary ( Those troop costumes were all made



BY HAND by the people wearing them) to the people at POST LOGIC (who



saved me several hundered thousand dollars) and on and on . . .</p>







<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I've said this all before, but it seems to bare repeating -



especially with most of the attention being focused on me. TROOPS exists



because a lot of good friends of mine gave generously of their time and



great talents to help pull this film off. All are deserving of the



attention and credit that TROOPS is generating.</p>







<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for endulging me. I hope you enjoy our film. And if it takes a



while to actually download it, please don't take it out on the good



people at The Force Net. They're doing more than anyone should ask of



them in trying to get this film out to you.</p>







<p>Take care & enjoy the film,</p>







<p>Kevin</p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><big><strong>A MESSAGE FROM TROOPS



CREATOR KEVIN RUBIO</strong></big></font></p>







<p><font face="Arial">February 11, 1998</font></p>







<p><font face="Arial">To Everyone:</font></p>







<p><font face="Arial">Well, here it is - finally. I hope it was worth the wait. Although



my name has been splashed across several web pages and articles related to TROOPS; I am



not the sole person responsible for this film. TROOPS, like most films, is the result of a



collaboration of some very talented individuals living and working (sometimes) here in Los



Angeles. I&#146;d like to take this opportunity to single out several of them.</font></p>



<b>







<p><font face="Arial">Shant Jordan</b> (pronounced &quot;Shaunt&quot;) and <b>Patrick



Perez</b>, my good friends and Prod./FX Supervisors: Their FXs are what raise this film to



an entirely different level, and it the biggest reason why TROOPS is as popular as it is.



Both they and I know this, but I wanted to express this in a public forum. Believe it or



not, this is not their best stuff. Some of the shots we had planned out would blow you



away! Time just didn&#146;t allow for us to include them. You may yet see them on this



site along with a brief write up on how they pulled this off.</font></p>



<b>







<p><font face="Arial">Eric Hilleary</b> and his entire crew: <b>David Max, Caleb Skinner</b>,



and <b>Kohar and Kenar Yegyayan</b>. <u>THANK YOU SO MUCH! </u>They are the designers of



the stormtrooper costumes, and the people wearing them. All of them gave more than I could



have ever hoped for. Although you will only see Eric&#146;s storyboards at this site - all



of them are incredibly talented artist. Their place looks like one big model shop adorned



with original concept ships and props that would put some sci-fi shows to shame. I hope



I&#146;ll be able to utilize their talents to the fullest in the future.</font></p>



<b>







<p><font face="Arial">Charlotte Fullerton</b> and the good people at <b>POST LOGIC in



Hollywood</b>: They are the reason that the film sounds as good as it does. <b>Bryan



Arnett, Fred Howard, and Connor More</b>, spent two weeks volunteering time after hours to



ADR, foley, and mix the film. To them and their wives, who didn&#146;t see them for the



all the nights I held them hostage - BIG BIG THANKS!</font></p>



<b>







<p><font face="Arial">Chris Gore</b> (Editor and Chief of Filmthreat Mag): Chris is, more



than anyone, the reason you guys are able to see this stuff. He was one of my biggest



supporters and cheerleaders for this film. He is also a very talented person in his own



right. I ask you to please take the time to check out his web site at : <b>&quot;filmthreat.com&quot;</b>



where you will be able to see more photos and storyboards of TROOPS, as well as



what&#146;s going on in the world of &quot;real independent&quot; film making. The site is



entertaining and every helpful to al you indie-film makers out there. Chris I&#146;m



forever grateful for all you&#146;ve done. (Make a print out of this so that you can throw



it back in my face if I land a big production deal and start acting like an ass)</font></p>



<b>







<p><font face="Arial">TheForce.Net</b>: Thanks for all the time and effort that



you&#146;ve put into this.</font></p>



<b>







<p><font face="Arial">Chrissy Hagar and EVINRUDE</b> (you know who you are): for keeping



my spirits up and my sanity in check when I was only getting 2 hrs. Of sleep a day and



driving all over town to supervise editing, sound mixing, and FX simultaneously. I love



you both!</font></p>







<p><font face="Arial">Finally: <b>George Lucas </b>(don&#146;t tell me y&#146;all



didn&#146;t see this coming) Thanks for three very entertaining film. </font></p>







<p><font face="Arial">Like the end credits say: <i>It is illegal to sell, purchase, or



make any money off of this video whatsoever. It was made for our amusement and yours (and



to showcase the under used talents of the participant) So don&#146;t even think about



selling it! If you do I will hunt you down and kill you . . . </font></p>



</i>







<p><font face="Arial">I&#146;ve put the film on this site and



&quot;www.filmthreat.com&quot; so that no one will have to pay for it. And I know



it&#146;s being bootlegged because I bought a copy this weekend! So to all you bootleggers



out there: I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE AND BREATH! Please stop selling it! I&#146;m not making a



dime off of this and it really pisses me off when you do! And, to all fans, please



don&#146;t buy a copy. It&#146;s not worth the dime.</font></p>







<p><font face="Arial">Ok, enough with the yakking. Enjoy the stuff on the site, have a



nice day, and may the force be with you . . . </font></p>
