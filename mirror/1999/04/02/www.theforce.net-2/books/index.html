Darth Biggles send us a whole pile of book news yesterday, and here's his first glimpse of the shelf stands for bookstores to hold Episode I products. Expect more from this spy soon:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>The first to be released is, as I earlier stated, a Battle Droid. I have now seen a photo of it and it truly is an amazing sight. The base, which holds the books is 3 feet high. On top stands the LIFE-SIZE and three dimensional Battle Droid, standing at 6 feet tall. A grand total of 9 feet! The other three dumpbins, which I haven't seen images of, are all based on the same pedestal; R2-D2, a Pit Droid, and the transforming Destroyer Droid seen in Trailer B. ALL will be available to purchase at $70 each by sending away with previously mentioned voucher from inside the TPM books.<P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<SMALL>Thu, Apr 01, 99 01:30:10 AM CST<P></SMALL>
Just in case you missed it, Canoe had an <A HREF="http://www.canoe.ca/JamStarWars/mar28_zahn_main.html" target="_new">interview with Timothy Zahn</A> over the weekend with some very interesting comments on the Star Wars novels in general and how the prequels will effect his stories. The article does contain some spoilers for the novels. Here are a few clips...  <BLOCKQUOTE>  He is almost dreading the May release of Episode I: The Phantom                      Menace because it could undo some of his interpretations of the                      Star Wars universe made in his five novels...<P>  Both plot points "were needed for closure," Zahn, 47, said from                      his Oregon home. "I was not making demands or anything. It                      was just basically, if I can't do these two, I'm really not                      interested in doing the book. Fine, thank you, someone else can                      do it, that's okay. And I guess they decided that both of those                      made sense." ...<P>  "Now, we'll just have to see if I got it right. If the Jedi going                      around in this prequel movies, doing all this extremely powerful                      stuff, then I will be shown to be wrong in my interpretation. But                      that's something that's always been there. Lucas is the final word                      on Star Wars. As it should be. And what he says and what he                      shows in the movies will be what is reality." ...<P>  "They were churning them out so fast," he said of the many Star                      Wars books, short stories and comics. "Mostly what I've had to                      work with are people's outlines, which may or may not be                      exactly what the final book turns out to be. That's always been a                      continuity problem headache all the way along. I'm surprised                      sometimes that we kept it as good as we did."   </BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<SMALL>Sat, Mar 27, 99 09:05:02 PM CST<P></SMALL>
I (Scott) was at the <A HREF="http://www.scifiexpo.com" target=parent>Sci Fi Expo</A> this weekend and had a chance to talk with Timothy Zahn a little.  (For those that haven't met Zahn, he's one of the most friendly and open authors I've ever met.  Definitely go meet him if you have a chance.)  I asked him if he had seen the info published in the latest Insider on the new Del Rey series.  He said, "No.  What's public knowledge now?"  Knowing what he could talk about, I told him that I was concerned that they were going to steer the series away from the storyline he set up.  I was concerned that they were going to ignore Luke and Mara's relationship and the plot points involving the Unknown Regions.  Much to my joy, he assured me that they will NOT be brushing off Luke and Mara.  In fact, for quite a long time, Lucasfilm has intended on the relationship between Luke and Mara to happen, thus Luke's abysmal track record with all the other women in the Star Wars Universe (including kissing his sister.  :)  ).  And as far as the invasion from the "outside" goes, it has to go through the Unknown Regions in order to take place.  So we really will get to see that part of the galaxy included in the novels.  This was great news to me and reassures me that Del Rey might know what they are doing.  :)  <P>Zahn mentioned that Thrawn's species will not be involved in the new books, but that he and Stackpole would like to pitch a storyline involving them to Dark Horse as a comic series.  If this is of interest to you, I suggest you <A HREF="mailto:dhc@dhorse.com">write Dark Horse</A> and let them know this is something you'd like them to print.  It might help Zahn and Stackpole out some if there is fan demand.<P>
