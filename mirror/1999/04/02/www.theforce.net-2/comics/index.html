It was over a year ago when TFN first told you about the Marvel reprint series from Dark Horse called <I>Classic Star Wars: A Long Time Ago</I>. Since that time, the project was downgraded from color to black and white, delayed many times and finally made to serve as bait for retailers to order other DH titles.<P>  After this long wait, I finally got my <I>A Long Time Ago #1</I> today. For me, it was "free" with the purchase of three issues of DH's "Bonelli Comics" comics. You'll have to negotiate with your comic shop owner for your copy.<P>  I must admit, it looks good in the black and white and smaller page size format. However, I was very disappointed not to see the work of two friends of mine who had been originally contracted to have work appear in this series. Comic guru and SW Galaxy Collector columnist Richard Handley was slated to write introductions to these stories. The intro was not there, though Rich is thanked on the inside cover. Also, TFN's own Amy Pronovost (an upcoming SW Kids artist) had contributed art for the cancelled introduction.<P>  In any case, it's great to see these 'classic' stories see new light and if you can pick up this title, I'd encourage it.<P>

<A HREF="http://www.comicbookresources.com/" target="_new">Comicbook Resources</A> has a short blurb on Tim Truman's involvement with the <I>SW Ongoing</I> and <I>Anakin</I> one-shot...  <BLOCKQUOTE>TRUMAN RETURNS TO 'PHANTOM MENACE' ERA IN 'STAR                        WARS' ONGOING <P>Sure, you may be smug because you've convinced one of your                        buddies to start camping out for tickets for "Star Wars: The Phantom                        Menace" already. But even if you get in on May 19, Tim Truman's                        already seen the world of the first "Star Wars" prequel. Twice.   <P>                        In addition to writing the "Anakin Skywalker" Dark Horse Comics                        one-shot that comes out before the movie reaches theaters, this                        summer Truman will also be taking over the ongoing "Star Wars"                        series set in the days before "The Phantom Menace."   <P>                        Truman, as you might expect, is suffering manfully through it all.   <P>                        "It feels great," he told the Comic Wire Sunday. "What a load of fun I'm having! I never                        thought I'd have so much fun writing this book, but it's become an incredible joy."   <P>                        The script for the Anakin one-shot holds a unique place in the works of this comics veteran.   <P>                        "I'm quite proud of the way the script turned out.                        It was the hardest story I think I'd ever done," he                        said. "I was picked because someone at Lucasfilm                        really liked the spirit and writing style of my                        'Tarzan Meets the Moon Men' 6-issue series I did                        with Tom Yeates. It was a rather pleasant change                        of pace to be recognized for my writing abilities,                        rather than my drawing, which is usually the                        case." </BLOCKQUOTE><P>
