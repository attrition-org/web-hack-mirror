<h2>Overview</h2>
</a>
<p>
The starfighters nicknamed &#34;TIEs&#34;
are the ubiquitous backbone of the starfighter forces of the Galactic Empire.
Similar vessels sharing TIE modular design elements
play vital support roles for the Imperial Forces
and in civilian applications.
Some of the most prominent known examples of these non-fighter craft 
are treated in this document,
in order to emphasise the common design elements.
<p>
Several models of TIE craft have been exposed and examined in extensive detail
in various official publications.
This document treats the whole series in a collective fashion,
in the hope that the detailed comparisons
will illuminate the fundamentals of TIE design.
Other sources have distorted the most basic aspects of TIE function,
or at least presented a confused and unphysical perspective.
The first few sections of this page reexamine the technological basics.
<p>
The latter, major part of this document consists
of a catalogue of the major designs of TIE craft.
Here they are presented on equal terms;
this is partly a response to previous references which have ignored
models which actually appear to hold important roles
in the Imperial forces in the <cite>STAR WARS</cite> universe.
<p>
Historical note:
&#34;tie&#34; was originally a reference to bow-ties,
a colloquialism invented by the ILM artists working on <cite>A New Hope</cite>.
However the twin-ion-engine acronym works handsomely
from an intrinsic view of the <cite>STAR WARS</cite> universe.

<a name="propulsion">
<h2>Propulsion</h2>
</a>
<p>
This distinctive series of small fighters and utility ships from
Sienar Fleet Systems is named for its propulsion system.
The label &#34;TIE&#34; literally means &#34;Twin Ion Engine&#34;.
Each engine generates a stream of charged particles
which are hurled at relativistic speeds and channelled
through nozzles at the back of the ship.
The exit of particles imparts a thrust to the ship in the opposite direction,
which is the same kinematic principle as underlies chemical rocketry.
The tight acceleration and streaming
of the invisible particles
is achieved by powerful applied electromagnetic fields.
The fields at the nozzle's aperture can be manipulated to
divert the stream,
allowing the thrust to be angled anywhere in a wide arc of possible directions.
The independent vectoring of the streams from the two engines
allows for extremely dynamic manoeuvring.
<p>
The engine nozzles are seen as glowing red circular areas
and are visible only from directly behind the ship.
Not all ships in this series literally fit the &#34;TIE&#34; name.
Some have different numbers of engines.
Lord Vader's custom fighter, for instance,
has four ion engines and should rightly be called
a &#34;QIE&#34;: &#34;Quadruple Ion Engine&#34;.
Other vessels, like the TIE Defender, with its three-fold symmetry,
have different numbers.
The engines of the TIE scout, bomber, boarding craft and transport
are difficult to locate and count using presently-available images.
Counting the engines of different models is an interesting exercise
which may tell us about the propulsive capabilities of the various craft.
<p>
TIE fighters have enormous accelerative capabilities for their size.
They can effortlessly make orbit from the surface of a habitable world,
which implies that their onboard energy sources are much greater than
6x10<sup>7</sup> joules per kilogram of the ship's mass.
This is the bare minimum needed to reach escape velocity from
the surface of an Earth-like world.
The same feat involving a planet of Bespin's size
would require more than nine times as much energy.
(Of course, even the most humble freighter craft in <cite>STAR WARS</cite>
are capable of that.
This is just an indicative energy scale for all <cite>STAR WARS</cite>
sublight travel.)
Considering the ease and rate at which TIEs
travel to and from planetary atmospheres in various books and comics,
and the tremendous acrobatics carried out at the same time,
a better minimum estimate on the energy available for propulsion
would be hundreds of times greater.
<p>
The fleet of star destroyers in <cite>Return of the Jedi</cite>
moved into its attack position with a nett deceleration magnitude
of at least 4000<em>g</em> [Earth gravity].
Starfighters are considerably faster.
An <em>Imperator</em>-class star destroyer can marginally outrun
the <em>Millennium Falcon</em> in linear sublight acceleration,
and most TIE models are significantly faster than the <em>Falcon</em>.
Therefore most TIEs are capable of straight-line accelerations
and decelerations on the order of at least thousands of <em>g</em>,
no less than some tens of thousands of m/s&#178;.
<p>
Devices called <em>inertial dampers</em>
are employed to prevent these accelerations from destroying
the pilot and instruments.
This is a commonplace use of artificial gravity technology,
which applies a force to the ship's interior,
varying to exactly counterbalance the inertial forces
caused by external acceleration and manoeuvres.
Inertial dampers have practical limitations.
Sometimes a force is too violent or sudden for the compensators
to adjust and counterbalance,
leaving a potentially deadly residual force.
The safety limits of inertial integrity may be
one of the chief determining factors of starfighter performance.
Because starfighters are subject to worse accelerations than commercial vessels,
they should be fitted with a higher grade of inertial dampers.
Nonetheless, many pilots turn down their dampers slightly,
so that they experience a tiny fraction of the true acceleration.
This aids a pilot's intuitive physical sense of his craft's motion
[<cite>X-Wing Rogue Squadron</cite>].
<p>
Some, if not all, TIEs possess repulsorlift generators for movement
close to a planetary surface.
This is particularly useful for unaided emergency landings.
Normally, TIE fighters are berthed and manipulated using
docking bay tractor beams in the mothership or base.
Most combat TIEs lack any kind of landing gear;
the preferred docking position is hanging from a specialised rack
with gantries to provide access for pilots and service crew.
In some comics and novels
evidence suggests that the wings can actually bear the weight
of an unpowered fighter,
but this might simply be a case of leaving the repulsorlifts
active while parked.
The heavy TIE transport ships rely entirely on a set of landing pads
because of its enormous weight,
and the wings are deliberately raised so that they can never touch ground.
<p>
Most TIE combat ships lack hyperdrives.
This mass-reduction adds to sublight flight performance,
and it is not a serious tactical or strategic restriction.
Since the Imperial forces can send enormous warships
or surface garrisons virtually anywhere in the galaxy,
there was no shortage of potential motherships or bases
for short-range fighter missions.
<p>
Long-range TIEs are not new, however.
Lord Vader's advanced TIE prototype is hyperspace-capable,
and the presence of TIE &#34;assault craft&#34; aboard the earliest
<em>Imperator</em>-class star destroyers
(which are drawn as unipod bent-wing craft)
hints that his &#34;prototype&#34; might actually have been commonplace
through most of the history of the Empire.
The TIE Scout craft also possess fully functional hyperdrives,
for obvious reasons.

<h2>Technology</h2>
</a>
<p>
<a name="wings">
<h3>Wings &#38; power</h3>
</a>
<p>
TIE-series starships have enormously powerful reactors for their size,
as demonstrated by the fighters' potent firepower and dynamic handling in
dogfights.
Since reactor power is disproportionately great for the size of the craft,
the removal and dissipation of waste heat becomes a problem of fundamental
importance.
TIE engine design makes this particularly problematic,
because the outlet nozzles are narrow.
Thermal energy from inside the engine
is only able to exit through an effective aperture
of less than a hundredth of a square metre per engine.
<p>
The solution is to add two or more heat panels to the sides of the ship,
and to pump the reactors' waste heat into radiator wings.
An effective radiator requires a large surface area,
but making the wings too extensive would interfere with the pilot's view.
The wing configuration of each TIE design,
with a given total reactor power,
is a compromise between these opposing considerations.
Darker surfaces make more effective radiators,
hence the predominant charcoal-black tone.
For a given wing shape,
the effective surface area can be increased
by introducing a fine grille texture or
some other pattern of lumps or ridges.
Even if we ignore the contribution of corrugation,
radiators held at only a few hundred degrees
(much less than the several thousand degrees
of the incandescent engine interiors)
may increase the effectiveness of heat removal by thousands of times.
<p>
The more powerful the craft, the greater the total wing area should be,
assuming that radiator technology remains constant
and that the same panel texture is always used.
This is the case
for designs newer than Lord Vader's TIE.
Ships such as the TIE Avenger, Defender and Scimitar appear to follow
the wing-area/power rule-of-thumb.
However there seems to be a distinction between the flat-wing and bent-wing
designs.
The flat-winged TIE fighters tend to have greater wing areas
for their power;
much greater than an Interceptor or Vader's long-range craft.
Bent-wing configurations may give a fundamentally better radiator quality,
perhaps through some kind of improved heat circulation.
Alternatively, there may be no technological advantage,
and the high-power small-wing designs may be expected to suffer
more obscure technical drawbacks.
They may be more fragile or difficult to maintain.
<p>
Since most TIEs are intended for the rigours of space combat,
there are some tactical design constraints.
To help reduce the chances of being hit,
a fighter should be shaped to minimise the area visible to an enemy.
The most dangerous situation in a dogfight is when
the TIE is directly in front of its foe:
this happens either when the TIE is being chased,
or in a head-to-head attack.
With the two ships moving and accelerating in parallel or antiparallel
directions,
the enemy pilot has maximum time to aim and shoot.
Encounters are much briefer when
the fighters are at oblique or acute angles to each other.
Thus the wings of most TIEs are built so that they face sideways,
and they appear only as thin lines when seen from
the front, back, above or below.
<p>
The bent-wing designs redistribute some of the side surface area
to diagonal facings further towards the top and bottom.
This makes the craft a smaller target from the side
but a larger target from above or below.
This may be an advantage if side attacks are more common than
vertical attacks,
but it's unclear whether or not this should be so.
Also, it isn't obvious whether this possible tactical advantage
would be the primary reason for bent wings, or merely an incidental benefit.
<p>
Apart from the wings, the TIE design is very compact
and reduces exposure.
Most of the machinery is packed within a cockpit ball
and the pylons which support the wings.
If the large radiators weren't needed,
it is likely that the entire ship would be made spherical.
<p>
The compact and enclosed engine design minimises
vulnerability to enemy fire.
Because the thruster nozzles are no more than a hand-span wide
and the drive mechanisms are hidden within the main hull,
a TIE would rarely suffer the kind of engine hits which
rebel fighters often receive on their
stripped-down, oversized and exposed hot-rod sublight drives.
<p>
Except on larger TIE craft,
the power reactor(s) are usually mounted within the cockpit ball.
The exact location is uncertain,
but the possibilities are limited
since the ball is mostly hollow, and has large windows on several faces.
There are two ringlike structures running around the cockpit ball:
one above and one below the pilot's level.
It has been speculated that these are toroidal fusion reactors.
Alternatively, the reactor(s) might be directly beneath the pilot seat,
between the engines.
Considering the small amount of space available,
the reactors of Imperial starfighters must be marvelously compact devices,
or else must occupy much of the craft's volume.
<p>
<a name="wings2">
<h3>Secondary wing functions:</h3>
</a>
<p>
Some sources suggest or assume that the wings of TIE craft are
solar power collectors.
Unfortunately, this cannot be one of the wings' significant functions.
Sunshine and starshine are not sufficient to power
the propulsion, weapons or any other major mechanism
of any craft which is as potent and dynamic as a TIE-series starship.
If the fighter is operating in space near a habitable planet,
the sunlight will provide no more than about a kilowatt per square metre.
The common TIE has an array area of just over a hundred square metres.
At this rate, it would take at least several weeks to accrue enough energy
to enter or escape the gravity-well of a planet.
The energy requirements for hyperspace jumps,
made by the non-combat TIEs and the most advanced fighter models,
are much more extreme.
<p>
A solar-powered TIE would be at a great disadvantage if it was deployed
in the outer reaches of a system or in deep space.
At most, any solar power collected through the radiators
is supplementary to the onboard reactors.
Perhaps it is enough to augment the power to cockpit instrumentation
and other peripheral processes.
At most, solar power could be used for ignition
when the fusion reactors are cold-started.
They might barely provide enough power to charge up
a small, low-temperature electrode fusion device,
which might in turn help to initiate the main reactors.
(Of course,
this would not be the primary justification and function of the wings,
but it might account for the popular perception.)
<p>
Various commentators have suggested
other secondary functions for the wings.
Most of these alternatives are concerned with propulsion:
<ul>
<li>
It has been speculated that the wings serve as electromagnetic devices
to further manipulate the engines' ion streams.
This theory suggests that the wing area should be concentrated
around the stern.
However, most TIE wing shapes are balanced in the fore-aft direction,
or else are extended forwards rather than backwards.
<li>
Another idea is that the wings are gravitic devices which are somehow used
to rotate the craft.
However this would violate conservation of momentum and angular momentum;
if the fighter can spontaneously start turning,
it must be exchanging momentum and angular momentum with something else,
be it the ion-stream exhaust or its deflector shields.
Most TIEs lack shields,
and the exhaust is already well manipulated by the thrust nozzles.
<li>
Another idea is that the dark areas are exhaust grills for waste gases,
but it is hard to see why such a large area would be needed for this
kind of process.
The true functions of the TIE wings must be area-dependent.
<li>
It has been suggested that the wing spokes may fire propellant
to assist manoeuvring,
but they appear to be structural, show no sign of nozzles at their tips,
and this theory can't explain why the intermediate dark areas would be needed
anyway.
</ul>
<p>
As part of the radiator function,
the spokes probably serve as conduits for some kind of coolant.
Hot coolant will be moved from the reactors and engines,
through the wing pylons,
along the spokes, through the radiator panels,
and back through different spokes to the pylons
and the ships' core systems again.
We need not know the precise physical and chemical nature of this coolant,
only that there is a coolant of some kind.
If TIE wings do play a role in manoeuvring the craft,
it is probably via some method of temporary braking
acting on the circulating coolant
(assuming that the coolant is ordinary matter with mass).
<p>
One more suggestion is that the wings are shield generators.
However most TIEs struck by laser cannon fire
do not behave as if they are shielded.
Furthermore, there is the significant fact that
many classes of ships known to carry shield generators
(<em>eg.</em> X-wings, Y-wings and star destroyers)
do not also have features resembling TIE wings.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="weaponry">
<h2>Weaponry</h2>
</a>
<p>
The standard mount point for the primary weapons of a TIE craft
is just below the forward cockpit window on the main hull ball.
Vessels designed for mainly non-combat roles
may have a single central cannon
with a barrel gauge of several centimetres,
but the most common configuration on combat ships
is a pair of laser cannons side by side.
Placement of guns near the centre of a fighter
provides a stable weapons platform
and may provide slight advantages to pilot aim.
[Central placement is reported as an advantage in performance comparisons
between World War 2 fightercraft.]
<p>
The laser cannons are usually represented as
short cylindrical protrusions from the hull plating.
An alternative form of laser cannon takes the form of an orange conical device
of a size similar to the cylinder-type cannons.
These seemingly simple structures
evidently are not the only mechanism involved,
because the blast bolts can be shot out in many different directions.
Although this isn't obvious to the eye, something inside the weapons
must be capable of swivelling.
The pilot may direct his fire anywhere within the field of view without
turning his craft,
and the tracking does not detectably delay the bolts' firing.
This is a significant advantage over the more static armaments of most
rebel starfighters, such as the X-Wing and Y-Wing,
<p>
Some models of TIE interceptors and other heavier combat craft mount
laser cannons and ion cannons on forward tips or the hubs of the wings.
The reasons for this are not entirely clear:
there may be tactical and practical advantages
in having the cannons widely spaced;
or it may simply be a matter of main cockpit ball being too tightly packed
with other systems.
Direct attachment to the radiators might allow a marginal improvement in
the cooling of overheated weapons,
or it might allow easier access for maintenance crews.
Spreading the fire may improve strafing,
and may boost the chances of scoring a few hits
even when a few of the linked shots miss.
Another possible advantage is redundancy of guns on a partially-damaged fighter:
a single grazing hit cannot ruin all of the interceptor's weapons at once.
In any case, most designs with wing-mounted guns already
have the standard chin guns;
wing guns usually seem to be supplemental.
<p>
The bolts fired from TIE laser cannons are consistently green in colour,
at least on the military models.
Green blaster bolts appear to be exclusive to spacecraft and artillery
in Imperial service.
The physical significance of this is unclear.

<h2>Cockpits</h2>
</a>
<p>
The cockpit ball is a constant of all TIE designs.
It can be used as a yardstick unit to determine the scale of
newly discovered TIE vessels.
Cockpit interiors and instrumentation are well standardised among the TIE series
starfighters and utility vehicles.
The TIE fighter, interceptor and X1
all had the same interior panelling in the films.
<p>
The main controls of a TIE are believed to include both foot-operated switches
and a double-handed control yoke.
The latter is a box-like device with several switches.
The pilot presses the whole gadget from side to side
affects the manoeuvring of the craft.
Thumb switches are triggers for the weapons systems,
and there is at least one rotating knob control which has some effect
on targeting.
Two of them might affect the direction of aim,
and perhaps the third knob affects the distance of
the point where the beams converge.
<p>
The tactical display for the targeting system is in the middle of
a rectangular box the same size as the head of the control yoke.
A circular screen displays crosshairs, a wireframe representation of the target,
and intermittently visible text providing tactical information.
To the right of the screen there are two rotating control knobs,
and another one to the left.
There are two small red indicator lights above and below the leftmost knob.
This entire panel may actually be the upper surface of the control yoke,
between the handgrips,
but the evidence of the films is not yet conclusive.
<p>
The cockpit walls are covered with
tiles shaped like regular right-angled triangles.
Some of these panels are bare blank metal.
Others are covered with red indicator lights shaped like circles
or round-ended straight lines.
These presumably are status lights of some kind.
TIEs with more or less complex systems may have
varying numbers of these modular panels,
in different configurations.
The meaning of the lights is not clear,
but the patterns are probably meaningful to trained Imperial pilots.
Panels conveying less vital information would be placed
further from the forward viewport.
Light tiles seem to be preferentially arranged so that they are clustered
together in groups of four,
with the right angles together.
Blank tiles surround these clusters.
<p>
It's possible that there is some kind of sensor display on the upper wall
of the cockpit to the pilot's left side.
When attacked by the <em>Millennium Falcon</em> over the first Death Star,
Lord Vader looked in this direction.
One of his wingmen also looked at the cockpit wall high to one side.
Since there is no viewport in this direction,
the men probably weren't just glancing at the freighter itself.
<p>
Alternatively, the pilot helmets may have
holographic virtual reality and stereo sound to provide
realistic audiovisual sensor information.
If this is the case then they may have been looking at a simulation
of the actual position of the freighter.
The cockpit instruments would be redundant.
<p>
There are two distinctive structures overhead
on the ceiling to the left and right
of the forward viewport.
Each of these objects consists of a cluster of four rounded metal rods
pointing directly out of the wall.
The rods are silvery, about two centimetres thick
and at least fifteen centimetres long.
Their function is unknown.
<p>
The aft of the cockpit has some more distinctive features.
in the exact middle of the wall there is a hexagonal window,
or a holographic monitor simulating one.
(Lord Vader's TIE X1 lacks a real aft window,
for instance, but he has a substitute.)
The sides of the viewport are surrounded by six
silvery metallic panels shaped as obtuse triangles
and bearing a number of short, round bolts.
These panels fit the edges of
the regular triangular panels of the regular areas of the cockpit walls.
To the left and right of the viewport area there are
large circular indicator lights, which are about three centimetres in diameter.
The starboard light is red; the port light is white.
The lights sometimes flash on and off, for an unknown purpose.
When Lord Vader fought to regain control of his fighter
at the end of the Battle of Yavin,
these lights in his craft flashed vigorously.
<p>
The primary hatch is on the middle of the aft face of the fighter.
It is circular, includes the stern window and is hinged at the top.
Within the cockpit,
at the bottom left and right of the window there are pneumatic piston devices
which are part of the mechanism to open and close the hatch.
There is a handgrip above the hatch off to the port side;
this aids a right-handed pilot exiting the craft.
On the TIE's exterior, the hatch hinge mechanism is prominent
on the upper aft part of the hull above the window.
<p>
There occasionally appear to be one or two optional secondary hatches
for entry or exit from a TIE.
The circular section on top of the cockpit bulb is sometimes
shown to open by either splitting into left/right parts,
or by a hinge at the back.
In the comics, the top hatch is often used for the launch of an ejection seat;
this may be its original intended purpose.
Looking at it from the inside of the cockpit, (in the films)
there is no obvious sign of a top hatch;
what ought to be the joint area is a nondescript surface
with a couple of dark pipes.
<p>
A third hatch, on the <em>underside</em> of the cockpit,
was present on four black-market TIE fighters
used by the Rebel Alliance in a covert attack on Admiral Giel's armada.
The bottom hatch may be a makeshift modification made to accommodate
other changes:
the laser cannons had been altered for a high-power blast capable of
puncturing capital ship shields;
and makeshift hyperdrives were also installed.
The original purpose of the lower hatch was probably nothing more than
for engineering service access to the fighter's vital systems.
<p>
There is a prejudice in the folklore of rebel pilots,
a belief that Imperial TIE pilots are treated as expendable
and that their craft lack safety features.
This is demonstrably false.
TIE pilots flying in space missions
wear a comfortable, insulated and fully air-tight spacesuit
enabling them to survive in vacuum.
TIEs are equipped with automatic ejection seats,
which have been seen in action in
the asteroid field in <cite>The Empire Strikes Back</cite>
and in many old and new comics.
[Wedge Antilles does not realise this capability,
eg. <cite>X-Wing: Wraith Squadron</cite> p.162.,
but this may be just rebel pilot folklore.]
The ejection seat seems to optionally launch through
either the forward viewport or the top of the cockpit ball.
The appropriate section of the cockpit is blown away
by explosive bolts firing a split second prior to the seat's launch.
<p>
The durability of the front viewports of TIE fighters
is a subject full of interesting discrepancies.
In <cite>The Empire Strikes Back</cite> TIEs flew from atmosphere into orbit
around Bespin, which means that the thermal properties of the transparisteel
must be superior or comparable to the hardiest hulls of the most primitive
spacefaring civilisations.
This is unsurprising, but
the response of a TIE window to blaster fire seems variable.
In <cite>X-Wing: Wraith Squadron</cite> [p.200]
unfitted viewport panels were used as cover against probot blaster fire,
which is generally considered to be more powerful than that of a hand blaster.
In <cite>Rebel Agent</cite> [p.123], a bolt from a blaster fails to penetrate
a TIE windshield, but causes blistering on its surface.
In <cite>Crimson Empire</cite>, a shot from a blaster pistol
smashed right through the window and killed the pilot.

<h2>Deployment</h2>
</a>
<p>
According to the relevant blueprints in
<cite>The Technical Book of Science Fiction Films</cite>,
the starfighter complement of the first Death Star was:
<ul>
<li>1831 TIE fighters;
<li>2904 TIE assault craft;
<li> 806 TIE boarding craft;
<li>1384 scouts.
</ul>
<p>
The <cite>Star Destroyer Imperator Class</cite> blueprints
list a hangar complement for
this common model of medium-sized Imperial warship.
This is indicative of the original fighter complement of the
<em>Imperator</em>, early in Palpatine's reign.
This stated complement is:
<ul>
<li>48 TIE fighters;
<li>24 TIE assault craft;
<li> 6 TIE boarding craft.
</ul>
<p>
The &#34;assault craft&#34; are probably either bombers
or heavy fighters similar to Lord Vader's.
The blueprint crossection portrays them as
a single-pod bent-wing design.
(NB.  Bent-wing TIEs are not especially new;
they have existed throughout most of the history of the Empire.
In addition to this TIE assault craft,
the TIE boarding craft and at least two designs of TIE landing craft
have existed for many years.)
<p>
Imperial strategy and tactics evolved over the years,
and by the later stages of the Palpatine Era
other TIE designs had been developed for more specialised combat roles.
By the time of the Battle of Endor,
the interceptors were used more widely and in greater numbers.
It was intended that they would eventually replace ordinary TIE fighters
in fleet usage.
Around the time of the Battle of Endor, the typical composition of
an <em>Imperator</em>'s TIE wing would be something like:
<ul>
<li>48 TIE fighters
<li>12 TIE interceptors
<li>12 TIE bombers
<li> 6 TIE boarding craft &#38; shuttles [speculated]
</ul>
<p>
The figures for the complements of <em>Imperator</em>-class destroyers
are probably representative of the composition of the starfighter forces
carried by other ships of the Imperial starfleet.
Warships with smaller or larger internal hangar space
would have fractions or multiples of these numbers.
<em>Executor</em>-class command ships by regulation have a bare minimum of
twice the <em>Imperator</em>'s TIE complement,
but this may include elite squadrons of TIE Avenger and Defender craft.
The sheer size of an <em>Executor</em> implies that its maximum fighter capacity
may be in the tens of thousands or more.
There exist carrier craft which are between a destroyer and command ship
in size;
they probably house hundreds or thousands of fighters.
<p>
The minimal Imperial garrison has storage space for
forty small unipod TIE craft.
The typical complement is thirty TIE fighters
and five TIE bombers;
the bipod bombers occupy space equivalent to two fighters.
Ideally an Imperial starfighter wing has seventy-two craft,
but the wing of a basic Army garrison is reduced
because the Imperial Navy tends to be
jealous of the starfighter forces assigned to it.
At least that is a commonly reported perception of the situation.
<p>
High performance fighters were provided to elite squadrons
engaged in missions of vital importance.
Designs such as the TIE Avenger and Defender seem to have been
exclusive to forces under central Imperial command,
under Grand Admirals or Lord Vader.
They were probably unavailable to the parochial local forces of
sector Moffs.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="catalogue">
<h2>Catalogue</h2>
</a>
<p>
What follows is a list of several of the known models of TIE combat craft
and utility vessels.
This is not a complete catalogue;
many other designs probably appear on the pages of the first-generation comics,
or else have not yet been seen in official publications.
For instance, there is fighter design which Admiral Ackbar recognises
as commonplace,
(its technical designation is &#34;V38&#34;,
akin to the &#34;X1&#34; of Lord Vader's fighter)
which remains unpublished and is only known by its similarity to
the TIE Phantom prototype.
It is quite likely that other TIE models exist,
which have by chance not been mentioned yet.
<p>
Some of the presently published references
are confused about the proper
terminology for the TIE Avenger and the TIE X1.
These vessels are often called &#34;TIE Advanced&#34;
as if they were mere variants of each other.
However even the most cursory glance at their features
(wing configuration, hull shape, number of engines)
shows them to be fundamentally different designs.
Although they may play similar roles, the Avenger and X1
are as distinct as the TIE Bomber is from the TIE/gt fighter variant.
They are long-range advance fighters, and the term &#34;TIE Advanced&#34;
is an obvious nickname.
<p>
The proportions of various TIE vehicles stated below are
derived from several sources.
The features seen on film take precedence,
but clear photogrammetry is not always possible.
Indeed a majority of the TIE models have not yet appeared onscreen.
In most cases, the orthonormal drawings in
<cite>Essential Guide to Vehicles &#38; Vessels</cite>
are used.
Therefore these results are only as good as the artistic work
of that publication.
In the case of the standard TIE fighter,
we are fortunate to have two separate sets of blueprints
drawn during the production of <cite>A New Hope</cite>.
<p>
The basic units used to calculate the lengths and areas is the diameter
of the cockpit ball.
This is a constant yardstick of all regular TIE designs.
The fact that the ball remains the same size on all models
is much more certain than
any of the absolute dimensions separately published
for any particular ship.
<p>
The stated dimensions of the special effects model of the standard
TIE Fighter are 36cm x 38cm x 48cm.
The model was built to the 1/16 scale convention,
so its absolute width, length and height are
(with appropriate precision) equal to:
5.76&#177;0.08m, 6.08&#177;0.08m and 7.68&#177;0.08m.
<!-- 7.2m, 6.0m and 6.14m,
(or 24', 20' and 20').
-->
This result is slightly smaller than measurements stated in roleplaying game
products: 6.3m length for the fighter.
Since no justification or reasoning for the 6.3m figure has ever been
published,
this document provisionally assumes that the standard TIE is 6.08m long.
On this scale, the cockpit diameter is 2.04m.
[Using the RPG-based figures would require multiplying
all lengths by 1.036 and areas by 1.074.]
<p>
Other statistics stated below include
the standard armament or payload of a craft,
the number of engines (if known).
An indication of each model's typical maximum acceleration is given;
these statistics are quoted from three types of sources:
<ul>
<li>In a handful of cases absolute accelerations
are taken from an explicit starfighter performance diagram
created by ILM during the production of <cite>Return of the Jedi</cite>.
The ILM unit of acceleration is MGLT;
for discussion of what it means, refer to
<a href="units.html#propulsion">Standard Units</a>.
<li>LucasArts computer games also use MGLT,
but the games' pre-Newtonian physics treat it as a speed limit
rather than a measure of the ship's thrust or acceleration.
LucasArts figures are taken at &#34;half ELS&#34;,
which is an average balance between engine, weapon and shield power.
<li>The WEG space travel units used in the roleplaying game were deliberately
designed to evade comparison of absolute values.
The unit takes different absolute values depending on the local conditions,
the presence of obstacles etc.
</ul>
<p>
By performing regression analysis on the data for several known
rebel and Imperial fighters and bombers,
it is possible to derive approximate mathematical expressions relating
these three different acceleration ratings.
The ILM rating in MGLT is proportional to
the LucasArts rating raised to the power of 2.4.
Thus the TIE Avenger and Defender are 240MGLT and 282MGLT on the ILM scale.
The WEG rating is weakly related to the other standards.
If the LucasArts MGLT rating is <strong>L</strong>
then the WEG rating is in the range <strong>W&#177;1</strong>,
where <strong>W=0.14L-5.5</strong>.
Thus the WEG propulsion ratings of the Avenger and Defender
cannot be less than 14 and 16 respectively.

These classic TIE fighters date to the later years of the Old Republic
and the earliest phase of the Galactic Empire.
The linear acceleration of these ships was on par with
rebel X-Wing starfighters:
both are rated at 100MGLT in the
<a href="/swtc/Pix/book/art/ilmmglt1.jpg">
performance diagram</a> drawn by ILM artists.
Except for Lord Vader's craft,
all of the Imperial fighters deployed at the Battle of Yavin
was of this kind.
The newer <a href="#tieln">TIE/ln</a> fighter achieves a higher performance.
<p>
Although he commissioned the advanced technology of the Death Star,
Grand Moff Tarkin's realm was a galactic backwater
and his starfighter forces consisted of less-than-new models.
Within a few years, the basic TIE had been almost entirely superseded
and replaced by the faster TIE/ln.
Like most TIE designs, the basic TIE fighter is short-range
and is not hyperspace-capable.

The new standard TIE/ln fighter
is visually distinguished from its basic TIE predecessor by
the darker hue of its primary hull alloys.
Faster and more durable,
it still lacks hyperspace capabilities,
but may be capable of more extended sublight flight,
such as the pursuit of the <em>Millennium Falcon</em> from Hoth.
The manufacture of a single TIE/ln is supposed to cost 60000 credits.
<p>
There exist several specialised variants of this TIE.
Most of them have been described adequately elsewhere;
their differences are not great enough to warrant separate treatment here.
The TIE/rc is a short-range reconnaissance craft.
TIE/gt is a light ground-support bomber.
TIE/fc fighters provide target designation and telemetry data
to aid the fire-control of long-range strikes
by warships or baseline combat fighters.
<p>
Another modified version of what otherwise looks like a TIE/ln
lacks the dark radiator panels on the inner wing surfaces,
which gives it effectively half the radiator area.
These fighters were most numerous in the remnant Imperial forces stationed
on Cilpar in the months following Palpatine's defeat at Endor.
(The only other kind of TIE seen on the planet was a heavily armed
<a href="#assault">bent-wing assault fighter</a> flown by the senior pilot
of the unit.)
<p>
Perhaps the radiator area was reduced because
these are ground support fighters
and airflow over the outer surfaces
is sufficient to cool the fighter.
Removing redundant radiators could simply maintenance.
Alternatively, these fighters may represent an intermediate of
the ordinary flat-wing fighters
and whatever technology enables the bent-winged
fighters to operate with reduced radiator area.
However it probably doesn't represent
a fundamental stage in technological advance,
because several kinds of bent-wing TIEs existed for years before
<cite>A New Hope</cite>.
Perhaps instead they are an extremely old TIE,
predating the practice of mounting double-sided panels?

TIE fighters with extended aft sections were part of Admiral Griff's forces
based at Jovan station
and participating in the early strikes against the rebels' base at Yavin IV.
This tail section resembles the structure of the Kenner TIE Fighter toy.
Its function is unknown, but it is reminiscent of Lord Vader's fighter,
and therefore it may contain shields or a hyperdrive unit.
<p>
It seems to be a commonplace vessel, at least in the campaign against
the Yavin rebels.
The fighter was not unique to Admiral Griff's command either,
because at least one more example appears in Moff Tavira's forces
about a year after the Battle of Endor,
in <cite>X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Warrior Princess</cite>.

This is a short-range reconnaissance TIE based on the common TIE fighter.
However the physical difference between the TIE Vanguard and TIE Fighter
are greater than for the TIE/rc reconnaissance craft.
Several large antennae for sensors and scanners protrude from the cockpit ball.
The upper section of each wing is shortened and swept outwards
to reduce interference with some of the dorsal scanner devices.
In extrinsic terms, this vessel was invented for the SWCCG card game;
in intrinsic terms, it was deployed by Imperial forces at least as early
as the Battle of Yavin.

<p>
A hyperdrive-capable scout and reconnaissance craft.
The unipod hull appears to be much longer and thicker than
that of the smaller TIE fighters, but the front end is the same standard
ball cockpit.
There usually is a single laser cannon on the chin of the cockpit ball,
although limited-production double-cannon variants have been seen.
<p>
In order to support the large radiator wings,
the wing pylons are the thicker, sturdier kind, similar to those of
Lord Vader's long-range fighter.
The wings are bent,
but unlike the wings of a bomber or boarding craft,
there is only one bending edge.
<p>
The wing area is mostly above the midplane of the ship;
presumably this is to keep the wings clear of the ground
during independent planetary landings.
As a scout craft, this ship should be able to land in places
other than the conventional ceiling rack of a garrison base or warship.
The TIE Scout probably has retractable landing pads like the larger
TIE transports.

<p>
TIE Boarding Craft were conceived for <cite>A New Hope</cite>
but could not be included in the film.
These bent-wing vessels are one of the oldest common TIE models,
dating back to the earliest days of the Palpatine's rule.
It seems that the star destroyer <em>Imperator</em> was designed to carry
six of these ships
[according to the <cite>Star Destroyer Imperator Class</cite> blueprints].
TIE Boarding Craft were also a major part of the hangar complement
of the Death Star battle station (806 were carried).
<p>
The wings and hull design are similar to those of a TIE Bomber or TIE Shuttle,
but the vertical segment is somewhat larger,
and appears to have radiator panels on its inner surface as well.
The starboard pod contains the cockpit, but has space for more occupants.
The portside pod carries at least a squad of stormtroopers
for boarding operations.
The forward end of the port pod bears what looks like a docking clamp,
and presumably has a general-purpose airlock
and automatic cutting torches
to breach the enemy ship or space station.
It is possible that this mechanism may be extensible beyond the vessel's wings
to facilitate mating with a wider variety of docking ports.

Whether the shuttle and the boarding craft are the same is unclear;
they have similar shape and size.
The boarding craft certainly must have superior armour and speed,
since it is principally used during hostilities.
The interior of the TIE Shuttle is less cramped,
giving the courier passengers more space than
the more numerous stormtroopers who are carried in each TIE Boarding Craft.

This bent-wing TIE transport craft is based around a single heavy hull pod.
Like the flat-wing triple-hulled
<a href="#tietransport">TIE transport</a> described elsewhere,
the lower wing surfaces are short enough so that they do not touch the ground;
support is provided by two pairs of landing gear.
Present imagery does not make the engines obvious,
but circumstantial evidence indicates that it has a hyperdrive.
<p>
On the dorsal surface there are two large antenna arrays
for communications or scanning.
The craft appears to be capable of transceiving interstellar hyperwave channels
with a sufficiently powerful warship like the <em>Executor</em>,
although the TIE is probably not able to open a channel alone
(much the same as for the hyperwave equipment on other small starships,
probots and tracking devices).
<p>
This vessel has a single pilot
(who wears an open &#34;cockroach&#34; helmet rather than combat flightsuit)
and room for at least one passenger.
Considering its use by former-Admiral Giel
in his investigation of the abandoned rebel base at Golrath,
it was probably able to carry at least a squad of stormtroopers as well.

At least two distinct models of large, triple-hulled vessels
are designed to carry large numbers of troops or other personnel.
They are used as dropships or as regular troop shuttles.
As a planetary landing craft, these TIEs carry no less than eleven troops,
and they seem to have space for many more:
perhaps a whole platoon.
Seen in the <cite>Marvel</cite> comic series.
<p>
Two different models are known, distinguished by their wing details
and the functions and features of the three hull modules.
(It would be fairer to treat each design in a separate section;
a future revision of this document will do so.)
There is a flat-wing design with smaller radiator area,
and a bent-wing model with somewhat larger area.
The bent-wing model was in use at least ten years prior to the Battle of Hoth;
the flat-wing model was employed on Imperial-occupied Bespin
before Palpatine's fall.
<p>
<a name="tielander">
On the bent-wing landing craft model,
</a>
the cockpit is in the starboard upper hull module.
The forward end of the lower module has a hatch for debarking troops.
The front of the upper portside module has a mechanism resembling that of
the equivalent section of a TIE Boarding Craft or TIE Bomber.
<p>
In the flat-wing transport ship the cockpit is in the lower module.
On the front of each of the upper modules there is what appears to be
a large boarding hatch for troops and their equipment.
The stern is massive and structurally complex,
and it extends well behind the wings.
A pair of circular structures on either side of the tail
resemble standard airlock docking rings.
However they may be too close to the engines to perform that kind of function.
<p>
Unlike most military TIE designs, these ships have sets of landing gear.
The wings may be unable to bear the ship's weight,
so they are positioned high enough so that they never touch the ground.
The flat-wing model has its flat wings positioned somewhat higher.

<dd>2 + 4 optional additional laser cannons (SFS L-s9.3).
</dl>
</ul>
<p>
This short-range fighter was
first manufactured soon after the Battle of Yavin,
and became abundant by the time of the Emperor's fall.
One of the faster Imperial starfighters;
its acceleration rating is 125MLGT according to ILM concept diagrams
prepared during the production of <cite>Return of the Jedi</cite>.
<p>
The interceptor has numerous hard points for laser cannons.
The most basic model has four cannons, which can be quad-linked,
on the front tips of the wings.
The sub-class of interceptors deployed at Endor
bore a pair of identical cannons in the usual place below the forward window,
and two more pairs on the hub of each wing near the targeting sensors.
This gives a blistering firepower with a total of ten laser cannons.
Of course, it is possible that some of the extra weapons
are ion cannons or other types of armament,
but their visible structural details are identical to the conventional
laser cannons.
<p>
It is unknown whether there are any practical disadvantages
counterbalancing the benefits of the weapons upgrade.
Perhaps the heavily armed interceptors have
marginally greater energy consumption,
and therefore need to return to base for refueling
slightly sooner than the basic model.
Perhaps they simply are more expensive to construct
and more difficult to maintain.
<p>
Other variants included a hyperspace-capable version
(possibly a separate class rather than a retrofit)
employed by Admiral Trigit in the forces of Warlord Zsinj
[<cite>X-Wing Wraith Squadron</cite>].
When Grand Admiral Thrawn returned from Unknown Regions to confront
the New Republic,
he ordered the development and installation of potent deflector shields
on his forces' TIE Interceptors.

A regular TIE interceptor like the ones deployed at the Battle of Endor,

The common notion that TIE interceptors have only four cannons is due to
the omission of small parts for the guns on the cockpit chin
and poor detail on the wing hubs
on the model kit made in 1983.
Since the computer games have subsequently used the 4-cannon model,
the most generous possible explanation is that the games reflect
a low-firepower, cheaper, older interceptor variant.
The ten guns on the interceptors used at Endor are all shaped
<em>exactly</em> the same as each other;
there can be no mistaking their identification.

Another distinct fighter, with greatly enhanced and overpowered weaponry,
was used at least as early as a few months after the Battle of Endor.
This ship had four cannons of enormous size on the wingtips,
and one cannon of more ordinary magnitude on each wing hub.
There are no weapons on the chin of the cockpit ball.
<p>
The observed example was flown by one Major Grode,
of His Majesty's Crimson Squadron, stationed at an Army garrison on Cilpar.
The garrison was in disarray
and had suffered from the continual attrition wrought by a local
resistance movement.
Grode had obvious problems with equipment and personnel.
This may be the reason why he was the only member of
his unit to possess the elite fighter:
it may be the only operable one left;
or he may have simply scrounged it.
Since the Imperial forces remaining on Cilpar were particularly decadent,
it can be assumed that this design predates the Emperor's fall
and was not particularly rare.

Lord Vader's personal fighter belonged to this
class of long-range (hyperdrive-capable) fighters.
It is sometimes regarded as a custom or deluxe design,
but this may be just a figment of hindsight,
since this class became a source of inspiration for
the later, famous Interceptor and Avenger models.
This heavy fighter may actually have been a commonplace long-range fighter
design used throughout much of the history of the Empire:
according to blueprints,
the star destroyer <em>Imperator</em> (the first of its class)
originally carried a number of unipod bent-wing &#34;TIE assault craft&#34;.
<!--
This seems to have been the hangar complement on the destroyer's maiden voyage.
-->
<p>
The &#34;customisation&#34; of Vader's personal TIE
might actually extend no further than its provision of shields
(This is a distinctive feature;
most TIE fighters are unshielded and rely on
superior piloting skill and tactical advantage.)
Alternatively, the modification might involve the partial removal of shields
or targeting systems,
since Vader's excellent piloting skills are augmented by
his mastery of the Force.
Perhaps the speed or the power of the weapons have been enhanced.
Perhaps the customisation involves life-support in the cockpit;
Vader's fighter might optionally provide him with an environment
similar to that created in his hyperbaric meditation chambers.
<p>
In any case, this fighter is
significantly faster and more manoeuvrable than its mass would suggest.
Four thruster nozzles are placed in two pairs above and below
the extended tail of the fighter.
This section, containing a shield and hyperdrive units,
blocks the usual cockpit rear viewport.
Therefore a realistic holographic viewscreen
is mounted behind pilot seat to mimic the rear window
found in ordinary TIE starfighters.
Judging by cockpit interior details,
the main hatch is still at the rear of the ship,
but the mechanism by which it opens must be more complex
than for TIEs with a simple unadorned hull pod.
<p>
The wing pylons are thicker than usual,
and there are large holes in their front faces.
Through these gaps, a set of curved pipes can be seen.
The pipes run in the same general direction,
from the main hull towards the wings.
These probably carry outbound coolant.
The partial exposure of these pylon pipes to space may be a modification
to further improve the removal of excess heat.
The long-range TIE Scout craft described above also has thick pylons with
similar holes.

An advanced, hyperspace-capable starfighter design attributed to
Lord Darth Vader.
It is sometimes nicknamed &#34;TIE Advanced&#34;,
but this is improper terminology
because it applies equally to other, completely distinct models
like Lord Vader's TIE X1.
Developed prior to the Battle of Hoth and used extensively
in unpublicised campaigns
against mutinous and corrupt elements within the Imperial Navy.
Deployed only with elite and ultra-loyal fighter units,
due to its enormous expense.
Production declined after Palpatine's fall,
for economic reasons.

The most advanced combat TIE seen so far.
Developed shortly after the Battle of Hoth,
following the success of the TIE Avenger.
Its applications were similar to those of the Avenger:
campaigns of vital importance to the Emperor,
especially the efforts against pre-Endor warlordism
within the Imperial Forces.
Equipped with hyperdrive, deflector shields, and advanced weaponry
of various kinds.
It is the fastest and most manoeuvrable manned spacecraft known,
but production was limited by its enormous cost:
over 300000 credits each.
The Defender was only available to the most elite starfighter units
with proven performance on the Avenger.

<h3>TIE Scimitar</h3>

<p>
When Grand Admiral Thrawn returned from his missions on the galactic fringes
to wage a campaign against the New Republic,
the TIE Scimitar was developed and commissioned on his orders.
This heavy bomber design also seems to have reached
the forces of the Palpatine Clones on Byss.
[The fugitive Royal Guardsman Kir Kanos possessed a TIE Scimitar
in <cite>Crimson Empire</cite>.]
<p>
The hull is an elongated unipod design,
with the cockpit extending forward beyond the wings
to provide superior crew visibility.
The two crewmen enjoy extensive viewport strips
along the cockpit ceiling, and below to port and starboard.
In an emergency, the entire cockpit pod can detach to jettison
the wings, main hull and payload.
<p>
A TIE Scimitar is propelled by a single ion engine,
augmented by a pair of powerful manoeuvring repulsor drives
mounted on the wings.
Repulsors are the most efficient form of propulsion
within the gravity well of a significant planetary body;
and bombers naturally spend many missions attacking ground targets.
<p>
The wings are an unusual shape:
scalloped so that the panels turn back slightly around the pylon.
This increases the craft's forward or rear profile,
and hence its vulnerability to enemy fire.
The explanation for this design compromise is not obvious.
It may be less a concern for this bomber than other TIE designs,
since the Scimitar is equipped with strong shield generators.
It may be an aerodynamic concession of some kind,
owing to the fact that these bombers often operate in atmosphere;
or it may have something to do with leverage and the action of the repulsors
to turn the craft.

Droid/computer controlled starfighter mass-produced
from the factories of the World Devastators
of the Battle of Calamari and the Shadow Hand campaign.
SFS had experimented with drone TIEs for many years,
but they were impractical as long as the Empire dominated
the sapient and material resources of the galaxy.
The drone fighter's
programmed piloting and combat tactics tend to be idiosyncratic or inferior
to a living pilot.
Therefore the ability to mass-produce it is the only major advantage.
The TIE Drones are deployed only in overwhelming numbers,
and in situations when the efficiency of manufacturing
outperforms the effectiveness of Imperial pilot recruitment and training.

<p>
This is a little-known experimental two-man fighter
produced in limited quantities at a secret facility sometime
before the Battle of Endor.
According to Admiral Ackbar,
it is a modified version of an extant fighter model called V38,
with the most important addition being
a special set of sensor/scanner countermeasures.
<p>
In the computer game the prototype craft appeared to be named &#34;Phantom&#34;,
but the term &#34;TIE Sentinel&#34; has also appeared
(most prominently in a Hasbro online survey about future toy concepts).
Most likely a TIE Sentinel is the V38, lacking a cloaking device,
and the cloakable experimental fighter is the TIE Phantom.
<p>
The triple wings total a radiator area equivalent to over double
that of a TIE interceptor.
There are three engine outlets in an equilateral triangular configuration
on the stern, which is a flat rather than spherical surface.
<p>
The cockpit configuration is unusual;
it looks more like part of a Corellian freighter than a spherical Sienar design.
This may have been used only on prototypes;
production models, had they ever been built,
probably would followed SFS conventions.
Crew enter through an elevator hatch under the primary hull.
<p>
The vessel is armed with two chin-mounted laser cannons
in addition to the three which appear to be mounted on the wingtips.
It also carries some remarkable power-consuming extras,
which might reduce its propulsive performance to something less
than an older fighter or bomber.
These luxury devices
including a shield generator, a hyperdrive,
and some sort of cloaking device
which is capable of operating even during a hyperjump.
<p>
The latter feature is most surprising for a ship of this size.
The Imperial Navy only used cloaking devices for very special tactical purposes,
and full cloaking shields were technically impractical
on anything but large warships or cargo vessels.
A cloaking device mounted on a starfighter
must have some drastic hidden or overt drawbacks.
Perhaps there are dangerous side-effects for the pilot?
Perhaps the fighter contains a compact but unstable energy source
that produces a gargantuan explosion when the ship is crippled?
In any case, the cloaking devices on the prototypes were flawed,
the cloak effect tended to flicker on and off,
and was prone to outright failure.

<p>
A fighter design which apparently was well-known in the <cite>STAR WARS</cite>
universe but thusfar has only been glimpsed in the literature
in the form of a modified cloaked variant.
At this time we have no way of knowing which of the Phantom's features
are shared by the parent model.
The basic hull, engine and wing configurations are probably the same;
if there were fundamental changes then Ackbar would not be justified in
calling the cloaked ship a mere modification.
The cockpit is certainly a standard TIE ball,
attached to the main hull, rather than the makeshift conical alternative
used on the transitional Phantom.
<p>
The military and colloquial names for this fighter have not yet been revealed.
The technical designation used by Admiral Ackbar is V38.
Perhaps it would be listed as TIE/V on tactical displays
(with this ship being the 38th sub-model),
and the common name (analogous to &#34;Interceptor&#34; or &#34;Defender&#34;)
beginning with a &#34;V&#34;.
Alternatively, it may be the &#34;TIE Sentinel&#34; mentioned in the
Hasbro online survey;
this designation fits the V38 better than its cloakable descendent.
Of course these speculations may actually be meaningless,
since the Galactic Empire does not use the Latin alphabet
and all fighter designations are translations from Imperial Basic.
<p>
The three wingtip cannons on the TIE Phantom may be a hint at
the role of the mainstream TIE Sentinel production model.
If these weapons are ion cannons they would compliment the laser cannons
on the cockpit chin,
and also would help to round out regular TIE starfighter forces,
which generally lack ion cannons.
The absence of ion cannons on common TIEs may have a tactical reason,
or else it due to technical constraints
(<em>eg.</em> ion cannons may require power systems
that are not easily contained on compact starfighters).
The TIE Sentinel is not a rare vessel,
but not a dominant and common design either.
Its tactical role must be special in some way,
and the ion cannon hypothesis seems a good possiblity
(though not a unique solution).

<p>
Exclusive to the forces of Warlord Zsinj,
and not truly a SFS design.
The most distinctive feature of this fighter is the absence of wing pylons
and the direct attachment of radiator panels to the cockpit ball.
The total area of panels is also very low;
this is probably a low-power fighter.
There may be other disadvantages and shortcomings,
such as reduced flight range.
Perhaps the design reflects Zsinj's ruthlessness,
making serious concessions to pilot safety.
For example, the compactness may come at the price of exposing pilots to
dangerous radioactive emissions.
<p>
The illustrations in <cite>Cracken's Threat Dossier</cite> are problematic.
They only show signs of two of the four laser cannons described in the text.
The weapons would more plausibly be mounted on wingtips
similar to those of the TIE Phantom or TIE Interceptor.

we see a slender blade-like fuselage,
with a spherical bulb at the aft end.
The bulb has a much greater diameter than the equivalent section
of a TIE vessel,
as shown when Darth Maul descended the boarding ramp
onto the Tatooine sands.
Assuming that the portal is two metres high,
the bulb diameter is no less than 4.9m.
(Therefore this is <em>not</em> a merely fighter-sized ship.)
<p>
On either side of the sphere there are two bent wings with a TIE-like form
mounted on pylons.
The wing panels appear to be hinged so that they fold down towards their pylons
in landing mode.
The most remarkable thing about the wings
is that there aren't clearly visible dark radiator areas,
at least on the inner surfaces.
Structures are glimpsed on the outer surfaces that may be radiators.
It is possible that the radiators are covered by a heat-permeable film
matching the tone of the rest of the hull.
The omission of equivalent radiator covers
on later Imperial TIEs may be a sign
of a more functional and minimalist design fashion.
<p>
If (and this is not yet proven) Maul's ship
really does lack radiators,
then the TIE-like wing shape may be just a coincidence,
or else it amounts to an interesting suggestion about the wings' function.
It may be that the wing shape is dictated by
something else in addition to the need for radiator surface.
Alternatively, Maul's ship may be a modified model,
with stripped off radiators compensated by having
wider engine vents.
<p>
The two ion engine nozzles are in positions corresponding to those of a TIE,
but they are broad and cigar-shaped instead of compact and circular.
The engine glow is a peculiar yellow-blue,
which may suggest the presence of small and closely spaced sub-elements
alternating in temperature between five thousand degrees celcius
and several thousand degrees higher.
(Purely green thermal emission is impossible.)
The simulated aural sensor signature
[refer to <a href="astro.html#sound">Astrophysical Concerns: Sound in Space</a>]
is very similar to that of a TIE fighter,
which supports the theory that the reactor or parts of the engines
are similar in design.

Shay Pierce:
<pre>
The thing that was not
immediately evident, however, was the fact that, from a design viewpoint,
the wings seemed to be a mere afterthought. I would speculate that the
starfighter fighters designers concentrated on the main cockpit and body,
which on its own fits in quite nicely with the other starfighter designs
seen during that period. The wings were probably added on by technical
and functional necessity. As the TIE evolved, the design, like the rest
of the Empire, rebelled against the decorative designs of the Republic
era and instead concentrated on functionality; therefore the TIE Fighter
was made as nothing but a cockpit with lasers and engines attached
directly to it, and wings to radiate the excess engine heat. As you
pointed out, even the wings probably would have been left out if it had
been possible. Later TIE models made use of the wings by placing laser
cannons on them.
