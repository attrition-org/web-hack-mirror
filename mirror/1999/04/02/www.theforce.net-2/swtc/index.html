<p>
These pages examine particular technical aspects of <cite>STAR WARS</cite>.
The motivation of this project is to synthesise and explore
a physically self-consistent reality for that universe.
There is an emphasis on topics inadequately covered by offline references.
<p>
Over the years, these commentaries have been greatly enhanced as a result of
debate and discussion involving many correspondents.
Suggestions are welcome,
although I cannot always give an immediate personal reply.
All original contributions are acknowledged.
Topic proposals for new <cite>STAR WARS</cite> technical commentaries
are also welcome,
but I'm already busy developing many other pages offline.
<p>
Visible and actual progress in these pages
varies according to the demands of my &#34;real life&#34;.
My own doctoral research takes precedence over this passtime.
Also note that these pages have no relation to my real physics work.
This hobby simply uses the methods and language of science
to consider the question:
<em>&#34;If the <cite>STAR WARS</cite> universe was real,
how would its phenomena be understood?&#34;
</em>
<p>
All contents are subject to revision and correction without notice:
the primary objective for these pages is accuracy and rational consitency,
not the development of any fixed dogmatic line.
New items are identified in the <a href="history.html">site updates</a> page.
