<h2>Introduction</h2>
</a>
<p>
This page is a review of the most visible kind of military ground vehicles
in <cite>STAR WARS</cite>,
and a starting point for consideration of topics related to
ground combat in that universe.
The cursory but broad collective survey of military walkers
is written for the purpose of illuminating
the common physical and functional characteristics of these craft.
The commentary deliberately foregoes indulgence in small details
for the sake of forming a more concise overview.
Particular sections may be elaborated into in-depth sub-pages
at some point in the future.
Possible areas for further study include physical analyses and measurements of
walker motion, firepower
and the effectiveness of walker armour and other defences.
Parallel commentaries should eventually catalogue and consider
military crawlers, repulsorcraft and war droids
in a similar manner.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="role">
<h2>Role</h2>
</a>
<p>
The concept of the military walker
must have some practical advantage
within the overall strategic and tactical scheme
of the Imperial Forces.
Walkers must have military value
in relation to the other instruments of surface warfare
such as repulsorcraft, artillery, infantry
and support from fighters and warships in space.
Whatever the key benefits walkers provide may be,
it must be due to something other than speed.
Armour is an advantage, but it doesn't explain why a walker design
is better than an armoured repulsorlift vehicles of similar size.
<p>
Possibly the best answer is     
found in the names of these vehicles - "all terrain".  Walkers are good   
for negotiating extremely variable terrain strewn with obstacles.  
Although a repuslorlift vehicle of equivalent size may be faster,
it is a single rigid object.
A walker's flexibility makes it easier to deal with  
terrain features which are abrupt and comparable to the size of the 
vehicle itself.
Additionally, <cite>Essential Guide to Vehicles &#38; Vessels</cite>
and other sources indicate that there are locations in the galaxy
where unusually variable gravitational or magnetic conditions
confound standard repulsorcraft.
<p>
Simply being in contact with the ground is an advantage for a walker.
The ground is a potent device for vehicular control.
A ground vehicle under fire or delivering its own momentous volleys
is braced and supported by the ground.
The advantage of traction allows a surface vehicle to stop, start
and dodge in an instant,
whereas a turning or braking aircraft has to use lateral thrusters
or rely upon relatively tenuous frictional contact with the air.
Crawlers share these benefits, but they lack the articulation
that helps walkers on particularly rough terrain.
<p>
Of course the cost of this stability and versatility
is that walkers have very limited speed.
This drawback means that there is a complimentary relationship
between walkers and flying vehicles.
Neither of them can serve every imaginable military purpose.
Speeds of dozens of kilometres per hour are enough for a walker
to dominate footsoldiers and artillery,
providing intimidating control over territory.
Contrast this with the operation of fast repulsorcraft
which must fly higher in order to avoid ground-level obstacles.
Repulsorcraft may have quicker access to distant parts of a battle,
but their speed means that they have a more superficial presence
in any particular location,
and they cannot operate so effectively near the ground.
<p>
Thus walkers are the prime combat vehicles for the <em>occupation</em>
of territory.
A walker trades speed for versatility and presence.
Walkers are built to seize and assert dominance on the ground.
It is noteworthy that the main weapons of known walker models
point forwards, laterally or downwards.
They are directed at enemy peer vehicles or at ground targets.
Walker designers may assume that
whenever necessary, walkers will operate in conjunction with
friendly flying forces
that are able to provide cover from enemy starfighters and airfighters.
<p>
This was not the case in many of the battles in the existing literature.
In the movies,
Imperial walkers only faced opponents with much inferior firepower.
During the Battle of Byss in <cite>Dark Empire II</cite>,
the walker and crawler forces did benefit from air cover,
which was swiftly defeated in the confined urban battleground.
<p>
All of the above-mentioned features and advantages of walkers
are also shared by large war droids.
Deploying crewed walkers rather than similar machines with droid intelligence
has more subtle tactical benefits that may not be immediately obvious
to opponents on the battleground.
The basic difference is concerned with decision-making capabilities.
Although a droid army may be programmed with
faster reflexes and greater specific skills,
an army of disconnected but cooperative living warriors
have a very different capacity for establishing and revising priorities.
The drawback of the droid mind is that it is factory-pressed and ideosyncratic.
Large groups of identical combat droids
necessarily exhibit a sameness of behaviour
that a smart living commander can exploit.
This was shown graphically in the Balmorran victory
over Imperial invaders in <cite>Dark Empire II</cite>,
when the Balmorrans droids themselves were programmed to anticipate
the older Imperial models.
<p>
On the other hand,
human walker crews all carry the variety of minor neuroses and inspirations
that are a natural part of being a living animal for at least two decades,
and these personal differences, and manifestations of informed volition,
may affect the combat reactions of each walker,
making each one slightly unique.
The physical advantages of a droid can be matched by the walker's
integrated sensor, communications and targeting systems.
The difference between a walker and a war droid
is the difference between a user with a tool
and a smart tool alone.
<p>
Of course war droids are more advantageous than walkers
in certain circumstances, otherwise they never would have been invented.
Xim the Despot,
the Trade Federation in <cite>The Phantom Menace</cite>,
and the Imperial holdouts of the Deep Core all used combat-capable droids
to fight their battles wholly or in conjunction with regular forces.
The key factor common to all these powers is that
manufacturing was more economical than recruitment and crew training.
Xim, being a vile pirate warlord, controlled only a small part of the galaxy
and he may not have had much confidence in the loyalty of his subordinates.
The Deep Core Imperial enclaves consisted of essentially barren space,
with very few inhabited systems
and insufficient time for personnel training to keep pace
with the Palpatine clones' expansionist ambitions.
The battle droid description in <cite>Behind the Magic</cite>
indicates that they are a secondary kind of army,
assembled as a matter of discretion,
and they are not otherwise preferred to living troops.
A live army is more difficult to conceal,
due to the conspicuousness of recruitment and indoctrination.
Battle droids are the kind of army that is built
whilst pretending not to have an army.
A full galactic government, on the other hand,
has nearly endless manpower to call upon.
<p>
Although walker crewmen share similar or possibly identical training,
the diverse functions of the machine dictate a diversity of forms.
Of all vehicles in the broad walker category,
there are many different designs serving unrelated operational purposes.
Some walker models are large enough to fulfill other roles in addition to
that of a basic assault vehicle.
For instance, the AT-AT walker serves as an armoured personnel carrier
(at platoon level)
as well as an indomitable mobile weapons platform.
Smaller walkers may have fewer interior options
but their mobility and lesser durability suits them to
tasks where a more fleeting presence is required.
<p>
A side-effect of a walker's powerful presence is its enormous visibility
on certain kinds of open terrain.
The greatest of walkers make formidable targets
that are slow-moving compared to their size.
However the resources of the Empire are such that it can afford to
build and deploy vehicles with armour and other protection
that confidently surpasses the firepower of their expected opponents.
On the other hand, visibility can be a great asset.
Walker gunners have a good view of the surrounding battlefield,
and they can shoot what they see.
Exposure to enemy fire is not so great a concern
when the enemy's fire is much less powerful.
Height and presence also imparts the advantage of immense intimidation,
when the walkers are operating from a position of strength.
<p>
The physical dominance and remarkable combat effectiveness
of some models of Imperial walkers
has led to a notion that they are &#34;weapons of terror.&#34;
This is an exceptionally negative idea
and it probably reflects an envious pro-rebel bias in most references.
Effectiveness is terrifying, but terror is not the same thing as effectiveness.
If walkers depended on scaring opponents
rather than their basic military capabilities,
then they would suffer abyssmal defeats against
battlefield foes who were either well-trained
or who belonged to species with very nonhuman thinking.
Even cheap war droids can be made to be dauntless in the face of a walker.
Intimidation may be an incidental benefit of walker design,
but not necessarily a key function.

<a name="deployment">
<h2>Deployment</h2>
</a>
<p>
In order to see action on a planet,
walkers must be ferried to the surface from their mothership or depot.
In controlled territory they could be shipped in parts
and assembled in a secure facility.
However deployment in a battle zone requires that the walkers be landed whole
with their crews in a state of readiness.
This requires an armoured landing barge.
Unfortunately these vital vessels are not often depicted
in the filmed and unfilmed <cite>STAR WARS</cite> literature.
<p>
A walker landing barge must be at least large enough
to contain its particular cargo.
Knowing the dimensions of various walker models tells us
that the corresponding barges must be greater than a certain size.
At the same time, the barges cannot be arbitrarily large,
or else they will not be suitable for use from certain classes of motherships.
<p>
It is doubtful whether the regular hangar apertures of common star destroyers
are able to pass a barge large enough to contain
more than a handful of tightly packed AT-AT walkers,
let alone a barge carrying one of the large walker models.
In non-canon official publications there is an implicit assumption that
the destroyers can deploy walkers,
but it's not clear whether a suitable landing barge could fit through
the forward bay, which has the largest hangar on the ship.
If this is possible, each barge could not carry very many walkers at once.
<p>
A simpler explanation would be that destroyers are actually not often meant to
deploy fully assembled walkers,
but tend to carry parts for the resupply of garrisons.
The AT-ATs participating in the Battle of Hoth probably came from
the <em>Executor</em>,
which has vast space available for the launch of huge barges.
The unfilmed, sheltered forward end of
the <em>Executor</em>'s main ventral cavity
may have several open hangars capable of launching
barges big enough to carry good numbers of any of the known walkers.
<p>
<cite>STAR WARS Incredible Cross Sections</cite>
suggests the existence of an enormous oversized hangar cavity
at the aft end of the main bay of the star destroyer <em>Devastator</em>.
Apparently, huge sections of the wall on this ship slide lumberingly away
to allow the ingress and egress of barges and other landing craft.
An unsheltered forward-facing hangar is an extreme tactical liability
for any spacegoing warship,
therefore this aperture could only be put into operation
when all possible attackers have been cleared from
the star destroyer's theatre.
<p>
The AT-AT cut-away diagram in <cite>STAR WARS Incredible Cross Sections</cite>
indicates that the large notched surfaces
on the lower edges of the hull sides
are actually the attachment points for clamps that secure
each walker inside the landing barge.
These braces make a great deal of sense,
especially in case the inertial dampers inside the barge happen to fail.
The jostling of a starship accelerating
like those known in <cite>STAR WARS</cite>
might be a danger if there were huge unsecured walkers inside.

<a name="crew">
<h2>Crew</h2>
</a>
<p>
In the movies, two distinct uniforms for walker crew were seen.
AT-AT crews wore a grey and white sealed flightsuit
with some additional chest and shoulder armour,
which may be a concession to the possibility of personal combat
on the ground.
AT-ST crews wore similar grey overalls without the armour,
and the airtight helmet used by the AT-AT crews is replaced
by a grey open-brimmed helmet with chin-strap and goggles.
<p>
The difference of equipment and uniforms deserves explanation.
<cite>STAR WARS The Visual Dictionary</cite> indicates that
the personnel with closed helmets have some history of personal combat,
but is silent concerning the unmasked uniforms.
Since the men are undoubtedly the same kind of personnel,
with similar training,
the reason for the variation of dress
probably depends on either the vehicle-specific requirements
or the operational conditions of different ground missions.
<p>
AT-ATs and other large walkers may have more complex controls,
requiring in-helmet displays like those of naval gunners or starfighter pilots.
Alternatively, the crews fighting on Hoth may have worn full environment suits
as preparation for the contingency of making vehicle repairs
in inclement outdoor conditions.
But if the cockpit crew are prepared to go outside,
then why wasn't General Veers similarly clothed?
Did he have optional attachments to quickly turn his suit into
an olive-grey equivalent of sealed snowtrooper gear?
<p>
Perhaps the distinction has something to do with the fact that the walkers
on Hoth were landed from space.
If these uniforms are used as the army version of a vacuum flightsuit
then their similarity to a TIE pilot's uniform would be naturally explained.
The walker crews probably do not double as barge crew,
because that would require too much multi-skilling,
but the descent to ground carries a non-trivial prospect of interruption,
hostile boarding or exposure to space.
In contrast, the men who drove the scout walkers on Endor
were permanently stationed on the ground, in hospitable weather,
and they would not have regular exposure to dropship flight.
Therefore they could wear a more comfortable and open uniform.
<p>
Alternatively, the difference could be due to a distinction between
stormtrooper and regular army vehicle crews.
There is as yet no evidence that stormtroopers
have separate armoured vehicle units,
but if they do then the stormtrooper-like masks of the AT-AT pilots on Hoth
would be easily explained.
However Imperial starfighter pilots have nearly identical helmets
and yet they certainly have no connection with stormtroopers.
Therefore the closed helmets of some walker crewmen
are not a compelling sign of stormtrooper association.
The closed-helmet vehicle crews are implicitly attributed to the regular army
in <cite>Rules of Engagement</cite> roleplaying supplement,
which specifically states that
&#34;there are no stormtrooper crewed tanks&#34;
and that stormtroopers are infantry only.

<h3>Windows</h3>
</a>
<p>
Depending on the climate and the walker model,
walker cockpits may have one or more viewports
that may be either open to the air or made of airtight transparisteel.
Transparisteel is a transparent substance that is only somewhat less durable
than regular opaque armour;
it is favoured on the AT-AT.
The AT-AT viewport has been known to withstand
collision with a rebel snowspeeder [<cite>The Empire Strikes Back</cite> novel]
but not a concerted attack by lightsabre [<cite>Marvel comics</cite>].
Open viewport hatches offer a more limited view of the surrounding terrain,
but permit sound from outside
and can be closed by armoured shutters.
<p>
There is something of an enigma about the forward viewport of the AT-AT walker:
from the outside it sometimes seems red.
In most pictures of AT-ATs the viewport is too deeply shadowed for
any colour to be seen, but there are
<a href="/swtc/Pix/cards/wide/tesb022.jpg">distinct exceptions</a>.
Yet from the cockpit interior, the surrounding scenery does not appear tinted,
as seen in General Veers' vehicle in <cite>The Empire Strikes Back</cite>.
Therefore it seems as if the window is not actually red.
It would be difficult to conceive of
a kind of glass (or &#34;transparisteel&#34;)
that outwardly reflects red better than other colours,
without affecting the colour balance of
the light that goes straight through it.
The effect probably is not due to the window itself.
<p>
In <cite>Return of the Jedi</cite>
an AT-AT carrying Luke Skywalker
approached an Imperial landing platform during the dark hours of the morning.
The cockpit was lit from within and the window did appear red.
The nighttime conditions hint that the redness
is probably due to the lighting inside the cockpit,
not anything to do with the window's intrinsic colour.
The use of red illumination at night is common
even in primitive nuclear-age cultures.
It has the benefit of making things visible
without greatly affecting human night-vision.
In other words, a walker crewman can see his instruments clearly,
but his eyes will adjust more readily
if he steps outside into the real darkness.
<p>
Of course, at least some AT-AT pilots and gunners
have helmets that are similar to those of stormtroopers and TIE pilots.
These devices usually have
built-in night-vision and image enhancement computers.
But army officers like General Veers
and enlisted crewmen in
<a href="/swtc/Pix/chron/atstcrew.jpg">unarmoured dress</a>
do not always wear these helmets,
so they at least would benefit from
the use of red night-lights in the cockpit.
The cockpit night-light seen active on one of the Hoth AT-AT walkers
may have been negligently left on at the start of the battle,
if the Imperial force landed just before or during dawn.

<h3>Feet</h3>
</a>
<p>
Most known walkers in in all mass ranges
have single-jointed toes on their feet.
The advantages of toes for a walker are probably similar to the advantages
of toes for a walking animal.
Toes provide added flexibility which improves footing on some awkward surfaces;
they add extra degrees of freedom, and this flexibility may improve balance.
<p>
Toes mean that the contact between foot and ground is capable of yielding
during the step.
A walker with a toeless inflexible foot would inevitably
press the sharp edge of its foot on the ground while running.
The poor distribution of weight at that instant
would create enormous pressure which could break the ground deeply
and thereby cause the machine to stumble.
<p>
On a few walker models, the toes may actually have some manipulative ability.
The toes of the <a href="#atst">AT-ST</a> are tipped with wire-cutting devices,
and the <a href="#cap2">CAP-2</a> has pincers on the ends of its forward limbs.

<h2>Catalogue</h2>
</a>
<p>
The names of walker classes are usually accompanied by an acronymn
expressing the main combat role of the particular vehicle.
For instance the AT-AT is an armoured transport,
whereas the AT-ST is a scouting vehicle.
The construction of English-language acronyms cannot be intrinsic to the
<cite>STAR WARS</cite> universe,
because the story is written as a translation of a tale from
&#34;a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.&#34;
<cite>STAR WARS</cite> can and is translated into languages other than English,
therefore English acronyms do not have any particular precedence.
Within the fictional universe, the real acronyms
would be written in a different alphabet
and based on the spelling of the walker's long description
as expressed in Galactic Basic.
<p>
Unfortunately only a handful of the known walker classes
presently have official names.
Walker models which differ from the named examples ought to have
equally distinctive names.
There is a fallacious prejudice that any two-legged walker must be
some kind of &#34;scout&#34; walker,
regardless of its actual capabilities and role.
In fact most of these designs are as distinct from the AT-ST
as the AT-AT or AT-PT are,
and they should therefore have a designation at least as unique.
Walker variants do exist,
but as a general rule of thumb they should only share a name
in cases where one
could conceivably be made as a refit or minor modification of another.
If the hypothetical conversion process
is as extensive as building a fresh vehicle
then they are in different classes.
<p>
The Kuat Drive Yards walker designations
seem to vary by only one letter at a time.
We can speculate on some possibilities for the true names of presently-anonymous
walker classes:
AT-BT bulk transport;
AT-CT command transport;
AT-HT heavy transport;
AT-LT light transport;
AT-MT modular transport;
AT-OT observer or overseer.
However this document does not have the prerogative of invention;
it is only an interpretive survey.
Walkers that are presently anonymous are treated as anonymous in this page.
The vehicles listed below already exist in the official <cite>STAR WARS</cite>
literature,
but it is the exclusive preserve of future official publications
to name them.

This massive walker is so huge that its body is almost entirely unseen
in the one available image of it.
Two legs are visible, and the orientation of their joints indicates that
they are arranged in front and back rows.
However it is quite possible that there are more than two rows of legs,
since the far side and the other end of the vehicle are out of sight.
<p>
The best way to scale the visible features in the walker picture
is to compare the far leg and foot with the trooper standing in its shadow.
He must be very close to it,
because is in the shade and he's also in almost the same direction as the foot.
Since he and the foot are both much closer together than the separation
of either from the camera viewpoint, perspective effects are minimal.
The distance from ground to the top of the footpad is 6.0m,
and the foot diameter is 10.6m, excluding the four toes.
The top of the ankle joint is 17m high,
and the shoulder and underbelly of the walker
are somewhere over 32m above the ground.
Because the camera's position and distance
in relation to any of the features are unknown,
the distance between the walker's feet is not directly calculable,
except that it must be greater than an absolute minimum of 26.8m.
It would be unrealistic for 10.6m-wide feet to be truly this close together;
and the overall length of the walker must be many dozens of metres long.
<p>
This walker probably has at least eight times the cargo and troop capacity
of an AT-AT, which only carries a single platoon of troops.
With a greater number of decks as well as a greater basic deck area,
the larger walker
probably could hold many more;
perhaps over a thousand men in comfort.
Indeed it might be able to carry a number of heavy and medium walkers
just as an AT-AT may carry speeder bikes.
This is much more practical for large-scale invasions requiring
delivery of vast numbers of troops and masses of equipment to a target zone.
<p>
This walker's prime role must be very different from that of an AT-AT.
Is it a siege vehicle?
It must be more heavily armoured,
and it is certainly large enough to mount warship-grade shields.
Its interior capacity may be large enough to carry thousands of troops
and numerous smaller walkers.
On the downside, it is too large for deployment from a regular star destroyer.
It could only be transported in huge dedicated freighters
or heavier warships with vast hangar capacity,
such as the
<a href="dagger.html#executor"><em>Executor</em>-class</a> command ships
or the massive <a href="dagger.html#carrier1">fleet carrier</a>
seen in Admiral Giel's armada.

This is another walker seen only in a single image.
Like the <a href="#ultra1">ultra-heavy walker</a> described above,
only two legs and feet are seen.
It is not even certain whether they belong to the same vehicle,
because all of the body unseen above the upper edge of the picture.
The orientation of the feet and legs joints indicate that
the line of sight is transverse to the walker(s).
If it is a single vehicle, the distance to the far foot indicates that
it is very wide and it would be much more massive than an AT-AT.
<p>
Otherwise, it must be of a scale comparable to an AT-AT,
because the leg is higher than half an AT-AT's height.
The visible portion of the far leg extends 12.5m above the ground,
which is comparable to the size of an AT-AT leg.
The top of the foot pad is about 3.0m high,
and the diameter is 4.6m.
There are no toes on the visible side of the foot.

<p>
The AT-AT walker is the model seen most commonly in the <cite>STAR WARS</cite>
movies, and its role seems to be roughly analogous to that of
TIE fighters in space.
Because it is so well documented,
the AT-AT serves as a good benchmark for discussion of other walker types,
without necessarily conceding it any kind of primacy.
Some commentators blithely assume that it is the largest land vehicle
in the inventory of the Imperial Army,
but this assumption has no real justification.
<p>
The scale of the AT-AT is contentious.
There are several independent claims and points of evidence:
<ul>
<li>
<cite>West End Games</cite> and derivative sources
indicate a height of fifteen metres,
but they do not state any justification or proof.
Their number could be an arbitrary invention for all we know.
On the other hand, AT-AT walkers seem much bigger in the movies.
<li>
A late-stage ILM scaling diagram from the production of
<cite>The Empire Strikes Back</cite> indicates a height of about 14.5m.
However it's impossible to say whether this diagram reflects the final
condition of the movie.
<li>
Long-range views of Luke Skywalker ascending a cable beneath an AT-AT
indicate a height of 22.6m, with a precision of seven percent.
<li>
Comparison of an AT-AT and the scale of the handrails of a docking platform
at Endor in <cite>Return of the Jedi</cite> indicate a height of about 23m,
with the rail being slightly more than 1.0m above the deck.
This is consistent with architectural standards handrails on Earth.
<li>
One of the walkers on Hoth managed to crush Skywalker's snowspeeder,
covering most of the vehicle with the walker's footpad.
If an AT-AT is about 23m tall, the foot diameter is about 4.5m.
The snowspeeder's length is independently known from set blueprints: 4.53m.
If the AT-AT was only 15m tall, it could not have covered the 'speeder as
well as it did.
<li>
Interestingly, the length of the snowspeeder as indicated by set blueprints
[<cite>The Art of STAR WARS Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</cite>]
is 4.5m, which would suggest that the walker foot should have covered it.
However vehicles on movie sets are traditionally built underscale.
Oddly, the <cite>West End Games</cite> value for the snowspeeder length
is 5.5m, which supports the larger, non-WEG value walker height.
<li>
A stormtrooper officer receiving orders from General Veers
was able to stand and walk within the AT-AT cockpit.
If the vehicle was only scaled to 15m tall,
the space between floor and ceiling in the cockpit would have been
no more than 1.3m.
The walker must be scaled to over 20m in height in order to allow
the observed cockpit scenes to fit.
<li>
Observations of a snowspeeder in the act of tying an AT-AT's legs
would provide another scale estimate.
By initial eyeball estimates,
these scenes seem to support a larger AT-AT height.
</ul>
<p>
On the balance of evidence, an AT-AT walker is approximately 23m tall
and 26m long.
<p>
<h3>Motion:</h3>
<p>
During the normal walking motion of an AT-AT,
only one foot moves at a time.
On flat terrain, the steps are taken in a regular sequence.
When the walker is moving straight ahead,
all the steps are the same length.
When the walker turns or traverses uneven terrain,
the step sizes vary.
<p>
The top speed of an AT-AT is said to be about 60km/hr or 17m/s.
At this pace the vehicle would advance by its own body length in 1.6 seconds.
This is not an unreasonable level of activity considering
the length of the walker's stride and the effectiveness of power sources
in <cite>STAR WARS</cite> technology.
If the stride of an AT-AT is about ten metres,
Each foot would make a step every 0.6s
during a drive at maximum speed.
If only one leg moves at a time,
each entire step would have to start and finish within 0.15s.
It seems most likely that a running AT-AT steps with more than one foot
at a time.
It is most likely that
the diagonally opposite feet would move synchronously.
<p>
The walkers on Hoth took steps of about ten metres every second,
one foot at a time, which corresponds to about 9km/hr.
This is much less than top speed.
Veers' group was probably stepping cautiously across the perilous glacier,
and they were distracted by the need to turn to fire upon rebel 'speeders.
<p>
The maximum mobility of the leg joints is not known.
The legs can move sideways at the hip, to some extent,
as shown when General Veers' walker sidestepped
to blast an oncoming snowspeeder from the sky.
<p>
<h3>Capacity:</h3>
<p>
According to the
<cite>STAR WARS Encyclopedia</cite>
and earlier references from the roleplaying game,
AT-AT walkers carry forty ground troops plus five speeder bikes.
According to the <cite>STAR WARS Sourcebook</cite>,
an alternative interior fit allows an AT-AT to carry two scout walkers.
It's not clear how anything as large as an AT-ST could fit in the AT-AT hull,
unless it is partially disassembled,
so this may mean a smaller kind of walker.
<p>
AT-AT walkers are reported to deploy their passengers
via several different means.
They supposedly can kneel to within three metres of the ground
for the troops to debark via side or rear hatches.
The existence of side hatches is strongly suggested by the rectangular outlines
seen on the sides of the walkers,
and some of these panels actually shook loose
when an AT-AT tripped in <cite>The Empire Strikes Back</cite>.
At least one side hatch was confirmed explicitly in
<cite>Return of the Jedi</cite> when a walker docked at
an Endor landing platform and several passengers emerged.
However the existence of a rear hatch is extremely doubtful.
The hind section of an AT-AT is consists of solid drive mechanisms
connected to the cylindrical belly shaft.
<p>
In <cite>STAR WARS Incredible Cross-Sections</cite>
the cut-away diagram of the AT-AT reveals two internal decks,
and that the troops riding in the body section
deploy through one or more belly or side hatches.
They appear to absail down a cable attached to an overhead railing.
In many other representations the exiting troops march down extended ramps
from the side hatches while the AT-AT is prone and temporarily immobile.
In contrast the absailing procedure is quick to disgorge the men
and spares the walker from vulnerability
since it can occur while the machine is upright.
This form of deployment probably takes precedence over the
kneeling and ramp extension operation,
which would be acceptable only in pacified zones.
<p>
<blockquote>
AT-AT walkers can unleash their assault forces in several rapid waves
using drop-lines with attached harnesses.  Boom racks extend to drop
combat troops and equipment over the side.  Speeder bikes are deployed
using harnesses at front and back.
</blockquote>
<p>
The importance of troop and cargo capacity in the AT-AT design is unclear.
On the one hand, the name of the vehicle, &#34;armoured transport&#34;,
implies that the carrier role is essential.
On the other hand
forty troops is a mere platoon,
and it is not a large number compared to the overall size of the vehicle.
The troops seem to sit in spacious comfort.
At the same time these walkers clearly act as front-line attack vehicles.
there may be larger walker vehicles in the Imperial arsenal,
and they also must have the luxury of abundant deck space.
It seems likely that most large walkers serve as personnel carriers
to some secondary extent,
because sheer size makes it easy to design habitable interior spaces.
<p>
<p>
<h3>Weaponry:</h3>
<p>
When General Veers' walker fired upon the rebel power generator,
at the climax of the Battle of Hoth,
one of his crewmen estimated the range as &#34;one-seven-decimal-two-eight&#34;.
Metric units are standard in the <cite>STAR WARS</cite> movies,
so this range is almost certainly 17.28km.
Judging by the view from the walker cockpit,
the generator is clearly much more distant than a few metres,
tens of metres of hundreds of metres.
<p>
This range is on the order of the distance to the horizon
for a terrestrial planet.
The higher one stands, the greater the distance to the horizon,
since the line of sight passes over and around more of the planet's curvature.
If the planet Hoth&#160;6 is the same size as Earth,
the view across a flat battlefield would extend up to about 16km
for a viewer in a walker cockpit.
If the walkers were on high ground, the horizon distance would be further:
a 80m rise would extend the line-of-sight range to over 32km.
Since the AT-ATs attacked over a &#34;North Ridge&#34;,
the range of 17.28km is probably just the direct line-of-sight distance
just after the generator came over the horizon.
This indicates that line-of-sight obstructions are the only practical limitation
on the range of the AT-AT's guns,
and the intrinsic range of the weapons is very much greater.
<p>
This incident is a valuable benchmark for the performance of AT-AT weapons,
since by Veers' command &#34;maximum firepower&#34; was used.
The blasts at the generator seemed to involve visible bolts
that were particularly long
or perhaps a series of smaller bolts in very close succession.
This establishes a limit on fire rate
and demonstrates the appearance of maximum intensity bolts,
as opposed to the ordinary shots used elsewhere.
<p>
Then follows a shot in which the generator is shown exploding,
with rebel soldiers in the foreground.
This would enable the derivation of
a very rough lower limit on the size of the generator.
This minimum scale might give a hint about the AT-AT's range.
The idea is untested; it will be attempted during a later revision of this page.
<p>
The AT-AT has two pairs of guns, mounted on the chin and the cheeks.
The heavier cannons on the chins are fixed to point in the direction
of the walker's head.
They therefore have more physical support,
and they seem to need it.
Due to some kind of recoil or another reason,
the guns jerk backwards be at least half a metre when they are fired.
They swing back into their normal position within less than a second.
The entire lower part of the walker's head looks as if it is dedicated
to suspension and power for these cannons.
<p>
The side guns are on vertical turrets,
allowing them to swivel upwards to fire upon targets above the walker.
This makes the guns better suited to defending the AT-AT
against hostile craft in the air.
The heavy chin guns, in contrast,
seem suited to obliviating slow-moving targets on the ground.
<p>
<h3>Armour:</h3>
<p>
AT-AT walkers are essentially invulnerable to conventional artillery fire.
Their hull surfaces absorb and dissipate blaster bolts
without the vehicle feeling so much as a jolt.
This tends to support the notion that the fire from
galactic energy weapons
carries very little momentum (making it light-like)
and that the observed kinetic effects are due to
the expansion of hot material in the resulting explosion and/or    
interaction with shields (which carry momentum and angular momentum).
<p>
Only two points of vulnerability in the AT-AT hull are known at this time.
One was the hatch used by Luke Skywalker to penetrate a concussion grenade
into a walker's interior.
That weak spot is hidden beneath the lips of the lateral hull armour
amidst the walker's drive mechanisms.
The second weakness is the pair of open vents
just under the armoured upper shelf
of the front face of the main hull.
One snowspeeder on Hoth strafed and missed these vents on an upright AT-AT,
before Luke Skywalker decided his trip-cable tactic.
After the first walker fell,
a 'speeder made an identical attack without fear of the walker's head guns.
It was able to blast the vents precisely and the AT-AT exploded immediately.
The intention and connection are clear.
Obviously this area is a point of vulnerability
whether or not a walker falls.
This soft spot is probably well-known to rebel pilots,
at least in theoretical terms.
<p>
The AT-AT walkers are astonishingly resilient to enemy fire from the outside,
but are easily demolished from within.
This is an important clue about the nature of the armour.
Its effectiveness may be directional.
Or it may be essentially designed for energy attacks,
with an enormous heat capacity and thermal conductivity,
so absorbed blaster bolts heat a large patch of hull slightly
rather than heating a localised area to the point of vapourisation
(which is what happens with ordinary materials).
It remains uncertain
whether these unusual properties are innate to the armour material,
or are the result of augmentation by something akin to
an energy shield suffusing the hull of an active walker.
If the former possibility is correct,
it seems likely that the armour incorporates exotic forms of matter
beyond those available to Earthly chemistry and nucleosynthesis.
<p>
The resistance to blaster fire is not just a ray shield projected
out to some distance from the surface of the vehicle,
as a starship would use.
If it was a ray shield, we would expect to see absorbed bolts splinter
into a shower of relatively harmless daughter bolts,
as is the known behaviour of ray shields in space.

Shortly before the destruction of Alderaan,
Princess Leia named one of the pet pittins belonging to her
foster Aunt Tia.
She named this attentive but particularly diminutive hairy creature
&#34;AT-AV&#34; in reference to a military walker
called &#34;All-Terrain Attack Vehicle&#34;.
This reveals the existence of a distinct and presumably formidable
class of walker before the Battle of Yavin.
Little is known about this vehicle other than what is implied in its name.
It probably does not carry many passengers
and it is probably exclusively dedicated to a role as mobile weapons platform;
as opposed to the AT-AT which partially serves as a &#34;transport.&#34;
Its stance, whether quadrupedal or bipedal,

Judging by the size of its visible guns,
this vehicle bears at least as much firepower as an AT-AT walker,
but it is less massive and has a less robust posture.
The weapons include twin chin-mounted heavy laser cannons,
and what appear to be medium cannons on shoulder turrets.
The three toe/claws on each limb are much longer than
the feet to which they are attached.
The head vaguely resembles the front portion of an AT-AT's head,
and the cockpit window is wide and rectangular,
indicating room for two or three crewmen sitting beside each other.
The neck is short and protected by the broad-shouldered main hull.
<p>
Two of these walkers were seen
defending the Byss Citadel against the ground attack by
the New Republic's commando forces and Balmorran war droids
in <cite>Dark Empire II</cite>.
Since these examples were seen surrounded by AT-ST sized walkers,
it is possible to determine strict limits on their dimensions.
These medium walkers are substantially taller,
such that their chin guns are high enough to fire over
the heads of the lesser walkers.
Nevertheless, they are significantly shorter than an AT-AT.

This walker maintains some of the dexterity inherent in bipedalism,
but it trades agility for massive armour and powerful weapons.
The advantage of this is that it makes a more robust war machine,
which is more durable under enemy fire
and more able to stride and crash through obstacles.
It is an exceptionally bottom-heavy model;
judging by volume, over half of the walker's weight is in its
feet, legs, and drive system.
<p>
The thick trunklike legs each end in three long toes
for balance and spreading the walker's weight.
The legs are jointed at an ankle, knee and shoulder.
These joints are internal and largely hidden by the outer leg armour.
It seems possible that they do not bend as far as
the joints of other walkers of similar size.
Each shoulder is a massive cylindrical shaft mounted
so that half of it protrudes from the walker's belly,
and the top half is buried in the lower rear of the hull's lateral armour.
It looks as if the shoulders can pivot independently about a vertical axis,
as well as rotating the leg attachement around the shaft.
<p>
A few examples of this design have been seen
in different parts of the literature.
When in <cite>Dark Empire</cite> Luke Skywalker was drawn into a Force storm
over Coruscant,
one of the <a href="#flying">wrecked walkers</a> lifted alongside him
had a boxy body and a bulky cylindrical triple-toed foot
similar to this design.
Later, the key example of the class
was seen defending the Byss Citadel against the ground attack
by the New Republic's commando forces and Balmorran war droids,
in <cite>Dark Empire II</cite>.

The so-called &#34;spider walker&#34; was developed on Carida
under the orders of the planet's defacto civil ruler, Ambassador Furgan.
It was first put into action seven years post-Endor
when Furgan sought to abduct one of the infant grandsons of Lord Vader.
Although that mission failed,
the design was disseminated to warlords of the Deep Core.
<p>
The MT-AT is intended for operations requiring the traversal of
seriously rugged mountainous terrains.
It is much more dextrous and agile than regular walker classes,
and its eight clawed legs enable it to find a very secure foothold.
The greater number of limbs makes the MT-AT more trip-proof than the AT-AT,
and provides better weight distribution for movement across unstable land.
If the MT-AT has a disadvantage,
it may be that its spindly form
seems more fragile than that of other walkers of a similar mass.
Its chief advantage is the ability to access ordinarily impenetrable positions,
but not necessarily to act as a domineering juggernaut.
<p>
This is the only known walker design to mount weapons
anywhere other than the main hull and head.
Each of the legs has a swivelling blaster cannon on the elbow joint.
Aiming these continually moving guns must be a considerable problem,
unless the gunner is aided by the semi-automated systems
that drive the vehicle.
(The gunner is one of only two crewmen who handle the complex machine.)
The larger chin-mounted laser cannons
are intended for defence against flying foes,
which must mean that the head can twist upwards with considerable flexibility.

with a proportionately large hull section.
The front part of the head is dominated by a wide translucent cockpit canopy.
The size of the head suggests that it may have capacity for
at least a dozen passengers

This lanky bipedal assault walker stands at approximately ten metres tall.
Compared to the AT-ST,
this machine has a longer stride,
superior gyro systems and better leg articulation allow
a proportionately faster running speed.
The head is almost as large as that of an AT-AT, allowing for a spacious
cockpit for the two crewmen.
The large space available at the back of the head might allow for
a significant cargo capacity,
a squad of ground troops or expeditionary passengers,
or facilities for the comfort of the crew on prolonged missions.
The foot claws lack the wire-cutting mechanism of an AT-ST.
The primary weapon of this vehicle is a single massive chin-mounted heavy
blaster cannon.
The fire arc of the cannon is not wide,
so the walker must swivel its head or turn bodily to face its targets.
<p>
Notes attached to the design sketch from <cite>The Empire Strikes Back</cite>
indicate that it is a one-man vehicle.
There is plenty of space at the cockpit console for an optional co-pilot
or passenger to sit beside the necessary crewman.
The walker encountered by Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker
in the jungles of an Imperial training planet
was manned by one pilot/gunner trainee and his instructor.
<p>
Known deployment includes
jungle, forest, glacier terrains;
and the walker existed at least as early as one year post-Yavin.
One of these walkers accidentally encountered Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia
on a nameless world that was used as a training ground for
Imperial troops and walker personnel.

This tall bipedal walker design
shares many of its basic features and proportions with
<a href="#lightmedium2">[light-medium walker #2]</a>.
It has a similar heavy chin-mounted cannon,
but there are two additional large weapons mounted on rounded swivel turrets
on the sides of the head.
Otherwise the head is much the same.
The undercarriage and legs are similar,
but the general stance is less upright
and the lower leg section appears to have shorter and has an extra ankle joint,
more like the AT-ST.
The feet have not yet been pictured.

This medium bipedal walker design is distinguished by
its open panoramic cabin windows,
long tail section
and aft secondary observation post.
Two rotating floodlights are fitted onto the front and back ends of the body.
The legs are study and the feet are four-toed like scaled-down versions
of AT-AT limbs.
The walker can squat to the point where the undercarriage is only slightly
more than two metres above ground.
<p>
According to the annotations on the <cite>The Empire Strikes Back</cite>
design sketch, this is an older model of scout walker.
A scout or observational role is consistent with the weak weaponry,
extensive viewports and consequently modest battleworthiness.

The two-man AT-ST walker guards the flanks of formations of larger walkers,
provides infantry support,
or conducts long-range scout patrol.
Several variants exist, with minor changes to the weapons and cockpit viewports.
In temperature climates on worlds with hospitable atmospheres,
a version with open-air viewport hatches may be used.
In more hostile environments, there is an AT-ST variant with
airtight cockpit and sealed viewport windows like those of an AT-AT.
<p>
Like the AT-AT, the size of the AT-ST is controversial.
There is a scale reference diagram in the production art of
<cite>Return of the Jedi</cite> indicating a height of 20'6&#34; or 6.25m.
The graphic novel <a href="novels/jk.html"><cite>Jedi Knight</cite></a>
indicates a height of about 7m.
Roleplaying game sources state a height of 8.6m, also without giving evidence.
The blueprints for the life-sized exterior prop
used in <cite>Return of the Jedi</cite>
state a height of 320&#34;, which equals 8.13m.
So far this is the evidence most consistent with
the final version of the film.
<p>
It has been suggested that AT-ST walkers may have some form of shielding,
because of their observed resistance to their own kind of weapons.
When Chewbacca hijacked an AT-St one Endor and used it against another walker
it took more than one shot to destroy the target's cabin section.
However this observation is indecisive because
the damaged area was out of camera sight.
It may have taken several shots to penetrate the armour.
The final blast may have been due to an explosion of the walker's power cells.
In any case, this incident is an excellent demonstration of
the comparison between firepower and durability in smaller walkers,
whether the protection involves ray shielding, armour
or some kind of intermediate technology.

This is another bipedal walker similar to the AT-ST scout walker
in terms of shape and scale.
The leg and gyro systems of the two designs are almost identical.
However this model's foot-pads bear two extra claws on either side,
allowing for improved balance
and slightly more flexibly of foot placement.
The claws may also provide better bracing when the walker fires its weapons.
<p>
Unlike the AT-ST, this is not a mere scout vehicle;
The weaponry is considerably heavier.
The side-mounted blaster and grenade launcher of the AT-ST are absent.
The starboard gun is replaced by a diminutive vertical turret gun.
The main armament is a large forward-facing vertical turret weapon.
This weapon sits in a broad vertical slot running up the
starboard side of the front face of the head,
and can presumably angle up and down.
The nature of the gun is unknown at this time;
it may be a medium blaster cannon or missile launcher.
In any case, its size is impressive compared to
the dimensions of the whole head cabin.
<p>
The weapon's size dominates the hull,
possibly reducing the amount of room available in the cockpit.
This could be a single-pilot vehicle,
which might require the superior concentration and multi-tasking skills.
Alternatively, the walker may rely upon a greater degree of automation
and a more advanced and expensive pilot control interface.
The examples seen on Byss were probably crewed by members
of Palpatine's Royal Guard.
<p>
No viewports are visible in present images.
There may be a viewport which is too small to discern on present images;
one of the AT-ST viewport panels would be difficult to see.
If there is a true lack of open viewports then perhaps it is
connected with the functioning of the prime weapon.
Perhaps the weapon produces radioactive wastes, a high-energy backwash
or other byproducts which
preclude open windows like those of an AT-ST scout walker.
<p>
At least four examples of this walker
were deployed by the forces of the Byss Citadel
during the Battle of Byss.
A few met the New Republic war droids before they reached the Citadel,
and three more stood amongst the last mechanised defenders of the fortress.

<p>
According to <cite>Dark Force Rising</cite>,
this is a one-man military walker design
used during the waning years of the Old Republic.
The Imperial-era manufacturer has not been identified.
It seems to have entered galaxywide though not ubiquitous use,
since a version of the AT-PT appears in Imperial use
in some recent LucasArts computer games.
<p>
The AT-PT is not large or powerful enough to pose much threat to
regular military vehicles.
It would seem to be most effective in a direct anti-infantry role,
since it has a single crewman
and places him on a level not much higher than the eye level of footsoldiers.
The operator of an AT-PT could be regarded as being just one step above
a user of power armour,
as the machine allows him access to the same kinds of spaces
as an ordinary solider would occupy,
whilst offering physical protection
and somewhat greater speed and agility.
According to <cite>Essential Guide to Vehicles &#38; Vessels</cite>,
the AT-PT was originally intended to give a single man the effectiveness
of an entire squad.
An AT-PT platoon would have more power than a regular infantry company.
<p>
The AT-PT has superior agility and stability than an AT-ST,
and can negotiate more rugged terrain.
It can also change stance,
going into a &#34;half-crouch&#34; in confined conditions
or raising the main hull for faster upright striding.
<p>
The crewman accesses the vehicle through a side hatch
above the shoulder.
The forward viewport of the cockpit is proportionately large
compared to the style of more modern military walkers.
This may be a sign that the AT-PT was never intended to wade directly
into the fire of vehicle-scale weapons.

<p>
The CAP-2 light single man Imperial walker built with four limbs,
seen in use by Lord Vader's forces around the time of the Battle of Hoth.
The hull is built in two sections, front and back.
The front part consists of a vertical cylindrical cockpit surrounding the pilot,
who is seated upright in an almost standing position.
The cockpit canopy is a transparent bubble giving the pilot excellent visibility
in many directions.
The tail section must contain the vital power and drive systems.
The aft end of the vehicle terminates in a large cargo claw
that is sometimes seen to hold an immobilised or incapacitated prisoner
collected from a battlefield.
<p>
The weaponry of the CAP-2 is minimal in vehicle terms,
but still quite impressive on the scale of footsoldiers.
The single blaster cannon is mounted on the forward face of the pilot module,
just below the brim of the cockpit canopy.
The vehicle's designation &#34;CAP-2&#34;
has not yet been interpreted officially,
but considering this walker's advantages, its acronym might mean
something like &#34;compact assault platform.&#34;
The vehicle's nickname &#34;captivator&#34; suggests that
it may be intended to wade through the lines of enemy footsoldiers
to capture vital assets
or even to abduct important officers from the field.
<p>
The articulation of the walker's forelimbs makes
the seizure and manipulation of objects and persons feasible for the CAP-2
in a way that is not possible on most other walkers.
As well as being nimble and multiply jointed,
each arm ends in a grasping claw or hook.
Combined with the dexterity of the legs,
the grasping ability of the CAP-2 probably allows it to move across terrain
at least as difficult as that tackled by the <a href="#mtat">MT-AT</a>.

The SecuriTech Espo Walker 101
is one of few observed combat walkers known to be manufactured by
a company other than the Kuat Drive Yards corporation.
It is an urban, riot control vehicle
used by the police and security forces of the Corporate Sector Authority.
Not a true war machine, the walker is only partly armoured
and there is a broad cockpit canopy to give the crewman good visibility.

<h3>Unclassified Others</h3>
</a>
<p>
Partial wreckage of several other walker models has been seen
strewn across battlefields in several <cite>STAR WARS</cite> comics.
The fragments documented below are complete enough to show that
they once belonged to walkers,
and that these designs are distinct from those described above.
However the incompleteness of the hulls
makes it impossible to detail all the features with complete certainty.
<p>
<h4>[single-pilot light walker]</h4>
<p>
A light walker with a head similar to the AT-ST,
but narrower and smaller.
There are two side-turret weapons and a large chin gun.
The snout tapers towards this gun
in a way that the front of the AT-ST head does not.
The mangled metal at the back of the head
and the size of the wreckage beside it
suggest that the head may have been connected horizontally to a larger body.
(<em>Ie.</em> the body may be attached behind rather than below the head.)
<p>
The TIE Crawler lying just behind the walker wreckage provides an excellent
yardstick.
The TIE cockpit diameter is about 2.04m, implying that:
the circular mount of the portside gun is 1.08m in diameter;
the side gun barrel is over 1.30m long;
the chin gun is over 1.92m long.
The first visible leg segment is at least 3.47m from joint to joint,
and the whole visible section is more than 5.20m long.
<p>
The estimates on the head's upper surface dimensions are
1.63m long and 1.29m wide, but the true values are close to these limits
because the viewing angle is modestly direct.
A complete walker probably stands about seven metres tall or slightly less.
The cockpit size suggests that it is a one-man walker.
<p>
The pilot's hatch is obscure.
It isn't the kind of rounded lid seen on an AT-ST.
The best possibility for the hatch
is a regular-edged depression in the front-right corner
of the top of the head.
If there is a substantial body behind the head section
then the pilot may actually enter through a hatch on the body,
then climbing through a neck passage to reach his cabin.

it is definitely from a walker,
but it's not absolutely certain to belong to the nearby head.
</blockquote><hr>
</blockquote>
<p>
<h4>[boxy walker #1]</h4>
<p>
This machine has a boxy hull that is taller than it is wide,
and longer than it is tall.
By comparison with background AT-AT walkers,
the vertical span of the head is less than 7.6m.
The body may actually be longer than the visible remains,
because the back edges show torn metal.
The crew hatch is rectangular and mounted on the upper surface;
and there is a armoured window shutter on the port side.
<p>
A pair of legs is attached to the forward end of the body
and they are jointed backwards like the limbs of an AT-ST
or the forelegs of a quadrupedal animal.
The foot appears hemispherical, and there is at least one squarish toe.
Whether there is a pair of hind legs is not yet known.
<p>
One of the most distinctive characteristics of this walker
is the abundance of medium and heavy guns.
They are conspicuously asymmetric:
about half of the port side of the hull is indented and dedicated to
a huge double cannon on a vertical turret;
the lower portside of the front face is dominated by a cannon resembling
one of the main laser cannons of an AT-AT;
and a lighter gun sprouts from the starboard edge of the forward face.
<p>
There is a rectangular crew hatch
on the top of the hull beside the portside gun.
There is a viewport hatch just above the forward laser cannon,
which suggests that at least one crewman
is seated immediately behind that weapon.

<h4>[boxy walker #2]</h4>
<p>
This medium-sized walker was destroyed and lay in the Imperial Palace
district on Coruscant during the battles following the Thrawn campaign,
[in <cite>Dark Empire</cite>].
The surface features of the body are difficult to interpret
because this machine is so thoroughly wrecked,
but there is at least one pair of legs attaching to the sides of the hull.
The legs have a rectangular cross-section
unlike those of [<a href="medium2">medium biped #2</a>].
There may be a small head cabin skewed off to one side of the rest of the wreck,
but this is not really clear.
<p>
The hull of this machine is at least 1.9m in the vertical direction,
judging by Luke Skywalker standing nearby.
The diameter of the shoulder joint is at least 0.5m,
and the leg seems to be at least 0.4m thick.

<h4>[boxy walker #3]</h4>
</a>
<p>
This walker is bipedal and its two legs are attached
near the back of the underside of the hull.
Each foot has three large claws: one at the back and two at the front.
Viewed from above, the hull is boxy and slightly hexagonal.
The chin underhang forward of the legs tapers upwards
towards the front of the vehicle,
where there is a laser cannon in a vertical slot.
There is at least one lighter double blaster on a starboard side mount
near the chin gun.
The viewports are few and unobvious;
the only one visible in present images is a hatch above the chin cannon's slot.
The rectangular crew ingress/egress hatch
is on the rear edge of the starboard side of the hull.
The hull is approximately two metres wide, four metres long and two metres deep.
The leg fragments suggest a height of about ten metres.

<h4>[flying debris]</h4>

<p>
Many walker pieces were seen as Luke Skywalker was sucked up by
the Emperor Clone's force storm.
One has a boxy hull, a single remaining rounded leg and
a distinctive three-toed circular foot.
This is reminiscent of [<a href="medium2">medium biped #2</a>].
They may be the same or similar models.
