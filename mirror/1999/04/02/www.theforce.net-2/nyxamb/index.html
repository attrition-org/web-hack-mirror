Out in the far reaches of the galaxy, beyond Tatooine, far beyond the outer rim, exists the Nyxamb Cluster.  Free from the galactic war, the beings in this quiet corner of space have their own struggles, conflicts, hopes and fears... They have just perfected hyperspace travel, and they have now invaded theforce.net.<p>



From the creative mind of Amara comes 'Nyxamb Cluster', a Role Playing supplement that can be used as part of an ordinary galactic campaign, or as a standalone using the West End Games rules.  <p>

This is a page in the making, most of the information exists in paper format (scattered in various notepads and sketchbooks) and so it is coming online as soon as I get things typed up.  It's not poor management, its interesting as you, the viewer, get to watch the cluster blossom and grow with each update.  Thank you for everyone that has taken the time to comment on this page.  <p>
The only sections which are currently viewable are <a href="history.htm">history</a>, <a href="aliens.htm">aliens</a> and <a href="planets.htm"> planets.</a>   These sections are not complete, but they are the three that will be  worked on initially.  <p>
The <i>notes</i> section will eventually contain GM and player tips, plot devices and character templates.<p>

Last Update April 30th.  The Planet section is complete!  Go check it out!<p>
