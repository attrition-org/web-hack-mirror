<CENTER><B><U><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=+2>Frequently
Asked Questions</FONT></FONT></FONT></U></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">We get a lot of mail from a lot of people.
Often, the letters ask similar questions. So in order to answer questions
for you easier, check out our answers to these Frequently Asked Questions.</FONT>
<BR>
<HR SIZE=5 WIDTH="80%">
<BR><B><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>General Star Wars Questions</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">WHERE CAN I FIND WINDOWS 95 STAR WARS
THEMES?</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Do you need a Star Wars theme for your
Windows 95 Desktop? If you have Microsoft Plus, then you can Click <FONT COLOR="#330000"><A HREF="http://www.windows95.com/apps/themes-movie.html" target="_parent&quot;">Here</A></FONT>
and get some really cool ones like a Yoda theme, a TIE pilot theme, an
X-Wing theme, and more!</FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">WHAT IS THE STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL
AND HOW CAN I GET A COPY OF IT?</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">The Holiday Special came out on TV back
in 1977 or 78. It was an incredibly horrible show that was about Chewbacca
trying to get to his family and home planet for Life Day (i.e. Christmas)
All of the original actors were in it, plus Bea Arthur, Harvey Korman,
and Art Carney. It was sooooo bad. Lots of disco, endless growling by Wookiees,
Jefferson Starship, and an awful life-day song sung by Carrie Fisher (to
the tune of the Star Wars theme). Lucas hates it and Fisher denies she
ever did it. The only good part is a short cartoon that introduces Boba
Fett, his first appearance ever. All the original actors (Ford, Fisher,
Hamill, Daniels) did the voices for the cartoon, too. It is the only redeeming
part of the show. Though it is bad, it is an interesting part of Star Wars
history that most fans will want to check out once. (Yeah, once is enough)</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">If you want a bootleg copy of it, go to
the collectors newsgroup and say you want to buy one. Somebody should help
you out. You can also try a comic or sci-fi convention. Don't pay more
than $10 for one (we bought ours for $7 at a convention). It will probably
never be released by Lucasfilm, so don't hold your breath waiting for a
clean copy.</FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">DO YOU KNOW HOW I CAN GET A PART IN
THE PREQUELS? HOW DO I GET IN TOUCH WITH LUCASFILM?</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Sorry, we don't know the number of the
casting agency for the prequels. While we do have some contact with Lucasfilm
representatives, they don't want their addresses released to the public.
Plus, we try not to bother them, so we only talk to them on special occasions.</FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">CAN YOU GIVE ME NATALIE PORTMAN'S ADDRESS?</FONT></I>

<P>Almost 2 years ago, somebody wrote us pretending to be Natalie Portman
and her friends Rachael and Amber.&nbsp; They were very convincing, but
in the end, the best we can figure is that some guy liked to pretend to
be teenage girls.&nbsp; So, no, we can't give you Natalie's email address.&nbsp;
We'd suggest you send what you want to send to the Star Wars Insider, so
that they can route it to her.

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">WILL THE MEN BEHIND THE MASKS TOUR BE
COMING TO MY TOWN?</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">We don't know, but call (818)759-8396 and
they can tell you. It's the headquarters for the Tour.</FONT><I></I>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">WILL YOU SELL ME ONE OF THE BOOKS OR
TOYS I SAW ON YOUR PAGE?</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">No. But we can try and help you find one
of your own. Just ask us.</FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE ABBREVIATIONS
YOU USE?</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Here's a few of the abbreviations you may
see on this page:</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">MTFBWY - May The Force Be With You</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">SW - Star Wars</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">ESB - Empire Strikes Back</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">ROTJ - Return of the Jedi</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">SE - Special Edition (Example - SWSE =
Star Wars Special Edition)</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">RASSM - The newsgroup news:rec.arts.sf.starwars.misc</FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INTER-FIDO STAR
WARS PAGE?</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Mike Farnham, the owner, had some problems
with a hacker. The hacker called AOL and told them to close Mike's account,
which they did. So Mike was out of luck, as far as AOL was concerned. So
Mike moved the page to another ISP. Well, during the transition, he realized
how much time and money Star Wars was taking up in his life. So, he decided
to shut the page down and quit Star Wars cold turkey. He said he might
try to start the page up again, but not in the foreseeable future. If he
does, we'll let you know.</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Technical</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">WHAT SOFTWARE DO YOU USE TO PUT THIS
PAGE TOGETHER?</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">A variety. Since we have several staff
members, and each has his or her own preferences, the list varies wildly.
For example, Darin is a command line Unix type of guy, so he edits files
on his Linux machine using emacs, or sometimes Netscape Composer. Some
of the other guys are Windows users, so they edit off-line using Netscape
or Frontpage or Wordpad, or whatever. For graphics, Photoshop is the tool
of choice, though Darin uses the GIMP (a free Photoshop-like tool for Linux).
Things like Lview and Paintshop pro occasionally get used too.</FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">WHAT KIND OF NETWORK?</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Our host has multiple T1 connections to
the internet.</FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">WHO HOSTS YOU? HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Currently, Simplenet hosts us. Check out
their page at&nbsp;</FONT> <A HREF="http://www.simplenet.com/">www.simplenet.com</A>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">
for more details. We have been hosted at Texas A&amp;M University, the
Internet Nexus, and Global Internet Solutions. We keep having to move because
we keep taking up all the available bandwidth...just too popular I guess...</FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But we seem to have stabilized a bit now.

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">HOW DO I (USE SSI, DO FRAMES, MAKE ANIMATED
GIFS, WRITE HTML, WRITE CGI SCRIPTS, SETUP A MAILING LIST, ETC.)?</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">We'd like to help you out, but we all have
school or jobs in addition to doing the page. You should check out <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/" target="_parent">Netscape</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.builder.com/" target="_parent">Builder.Com</A>, or
browse around <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com" target="_parent">Yahoo</A>
for help.</FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">WILL YOU HOST MY SITE?</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">We get a lot of requests to join TheForce.Net,
but joining is by invitation only. Sorry.</FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">WILL YOU MAKE ME SOME COOL GRAPHICS?</FONT></I><I></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">We really don't have time for that. If
you offered some $$$, some of us might make some time though. :)</FONT>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Legal</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">AREN'T YOU AFRAID LUCASFILM WILL FIND
OUT ABOUT YOUR LITTLE OPERATION AND SHUT YOU DOWN?</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">"It's always been a shadow that looms over
us, but..." Lucasfilm already knows about us and visits almost daily. Seriously.
We've tracked them in the logs. But since we put up plenty of disclaimers
and try to credit our sources and attribute copyright, they're cool with
us. LFL is not out to shut down fan pages! They do want fan pages to be
clean and responsible, though.</FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">CAN I RIP OFF STUFF FROM YOUR PAGE?</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">We can't very well keep you from hitting
that right mouse button, now, can we? However, if you "Xerox&copy;" our
site, we can almost guarantee you won't get as many hits as you would if
you were simply putting up something original.</FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">WHAT ABOUT NET-PSYCHOS?</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">An individual has been going around impersonating
us, trying to soil our name. He has broken several laws. Note that impersonation
of someone by forging an email address is against the law. So don't do
it. The FBI and local law-enforcement agencies do follow up on reports
of such abuse. If you receive a harassing message that appears to be from
us, please check the headers. You will find that it did not originate here
or from our personal addresses. Please let us know (in a kind manner if
possible!) that you received such a message and forward it to us including
the full headers.</FONT>
