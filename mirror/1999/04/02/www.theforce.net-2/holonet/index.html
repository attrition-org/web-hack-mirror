"Gravity Grave"  follows up his earlier emails with some additional information about the possibility of a travelling show of the Smithsonian's Magic of Myth display. This is sure to be a huge success, especially fueled with the anticipation of Episode I. Here's his followup:<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  I'm attaching the list of props and costumes and models that are listed in the brochure.  The list of artwork is just too long, I'd never get it all typed!  I can say that the artwork list consists of various paintings, drawings, and airbrushed photos by Terryl Whitlatch, Alex Tavoularis, Ralph McQuarrie, Ron Larson, Joe Johnston, Norman Reynolds, Nilo Rodis-Jamero, David Carson, Patricia McDermott, Paul LeBlanc, and marilee Heyer.  One thing that I probably should mention that I failed to in my original message is that this brochure is definitely not intended as a consumer piece - it's designed to drum up sponsors for the tour, so presumably until they are able to nail down sponsorship for this the dates are in flux.<P>  <i>MAJOR ARTIFACTS FROM THE EXHIBITION</i> <p><blockquote>  <b>Costumes- <BR></b>    Admiral Ackbar <br>  The Emperor Palpatine  <br>  Greeata  <br>  Han Solo  <br>  Imperial Officer's Uniform  <br>  Imperial Royal Guard  <br>  Imperial Snowtrooper  <br>  Imperial Stormtrooper  <br>  Imperial TIE Fighter Pilot  <br>  Lando  <br>  Lando disguised as Skiff Guard  <br>  Luke with saber  <br>  Luke - hoth gear and lightsaber  <br>  Luke - X-wing pilot  <br>  Lyn Me  <br>  Tusken Raider and Gaderffii Stick  <br>  Obi-Wan Kenobi  <br>  Leia  <br>  Leia (Bespin Gown)  <br>  Leia as Boushh w/ thermal detonator  <br>  Leia - slave girl  <br>  Rebel Footsoldier  <br>  Rystall  <p>    <b>Characters - </b>  <br>  Boba Fett  <br>  C-3PO  <br>  Chewbacca  <br>  Darth Vaber w/ lightsaber  <br>  Gamorrean Guard  <br>  Jabba The Hutt  <br>  Jawa and Blaster  <br>  Klaatu (Wooof)  <br>  R2-D2  <br>  Rappertunie <br>   Salacious B Crumb  <br>  Sy Snootles  <br>  Wampa Ice Creature  <br>  Weequay  <br>  Wicket  <br>  Worrt, road creature  <br>  Yoda  <p>  <b>Production Props and Models -  <br> </b>    Bespin Twin Pod Cloud Car  <br>  Darth Vader's TIE Fighter  <br>  Darth Vader's Helmet (interior)  <br>  Ewok w/ Hang Glider  <br>  Han Solo in carbonite  <br>  Imperial Probe Droid  <br>  Imperial Shuttle Tydirium  <br>  Imperial Speed Bike w/ scout  <br>  Imperial TIE Bomber  <br>  Imperial TIE Fighter  <br>  Imperial TIE Interceptor  <br>  Imperial Walkers  <br>  Interrogator Droid  <br>  Jedi Training Remote  <br>  Milennium Falcon  <br>  Mon calamari Transport <br>   Mouse Droid  <br>  Rancor  <br>  Rebel B-Wing Fighter  <br>  Rebel Blockade Runner escape pod  <br>  Rebel Sensor Pack  <br>  Rebel Snowspeeder  <br>  Rebel Y-Wing Fighter  <br>  Tauntaun  <br></blockquote></blockquote>    Gravity has also promised us some scans over the weekend. . . look for them soon!<P>

<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=#01237D><B>Boston Globe Article</B></FONT><BR>
<SMALL>Wed, Mar 31, 99 03:33:26 PM CST<P></SMALL>
Sidestep, Joshua D Bernard and Elizbeth Carver directed us to this article from today's <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com" target="_blank">Boston Globe</a>.  Unfortunately, the author's tone is a bit condescending, and we certainly don't agree with the comment referring to Countingdown.com.<P>    <blockquote><P><B>The second coming of 'Star Wars'</B><P>     By Alex Beam    <P> 03/31/99<P>     Have you noticed how the frenzy attending the release of the new ''Star Wars'' movie resembles Parousiamania? Yes, I thought you had.<P>    Parousiamania, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is the ''excitement or frenzy aroused by the thought of the Parousia'' - a New Testament Greek word referring to the ''arrival,'' or Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Believing Christians live in anticipation of this moment, the time of the Last Judgment and the establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth.<P>    The Bible isn't clear on the timing of the Second Coming. As a result, believers occasionally experience manic fits of anticipation, especially in the months and years preceding a millennium. How very odd that George Lucas has chosen the last Easter Week of the millennium to dial up the promotional hype for his new ''Star Wars'' episode, ''The Phantom Menace.''<P> Coincidence? Or something more ...    In one respect, this analogy falls flat. Two thousand American movie theaters have fixed the date for the arrival of ''The Phantom Menace'' - Wednesday, May 19. But in other ways, it holds up quite well. Earlier this week, for instance, Lucas & Co. announced that they wouldn't sell any advance tickets to avoid setting off a bidding mania among crazed fans. So the loons who run the Web site http://starwars.countingdown.com started lining up yesterday at Mann's Chinese in Hollywood to buy ''Menace'' tickets!<P>    In addition, we have: <P>    Gradual revelation: The unveiling of the two ''Star Wars'' trailers, one in November and one earlier this month, have attracted more attention than most movies released during the same period. The offical Web site, http://starwars.com, registered 3.5 million video downloads of the trailer during five days this month, probably an Internet record.<P>    Approved houses of worship: In a lengthy pronunciamento, 20th Century Fox bossman Tom Sherak has declared that only certain, specially qualified theaters will be allowed to show Lucas's precious work: ''The film will play all digital formats, Dolby Digital, DTS, and SDDS. If a theater is in a market that has digital theaters but does not have digital sound, it will not play in that theater.''<P>    Speaking through the prophets: The New York Times dispatched once-respected journalist Orville Schell to the Lucaslair, whence he returned with the news that Lucas really, really loves his children. In hot pursuit, CBS's Leslie Stahl gave Lucas 30 minutes of prime airtime to reiterate his startling declaration of unconditional love for his children.<P>    Relics for sale: ''All four new "Star Wars' glass Christmas ornaments are rendered with the old world craftmanship that has made the Christopher Radko name world famous with collectors. Crafted exactly as ornaments were a century ago, each unique piece is individually mouth blown, silvered and hand painted, and requires an entire week to create. Get ready to decorate your "Star Wars' Christmas tree.'' Available for pre-order from the Web site at $20 each.<P>    Canon Formation: Since 1994, Lucas's spokeswoman, Lynne Hale, has been filming the making of ''The Phantom Menace.'' Working with three recent graduates of Stanford University's film school, she has shot more than 600 hours of must-see video, which can be sampled at the Web site.<P>    If you've read this far, you might find the ''Star Wars''/Parousia analogy stretched, or even offensive. Let me refer you to the bible of ''Star Wars'' studies, Entertainment Weekly. EW reports that in 1977, with the popularity of the ''Star Wars'' story rivaling that of you-know-who, director Francis Ford Coppola ''seriously proposed that Lucas start a religion, using the murkily defined tenets of "the Force' as a central holy text.''<P>    ''That was Francis's thing,'' Lucas told EW. ''I remember him saying, "You know, you've got a certain amount of power in politics. But religion! With religion, you really have power.' I told him, "Forget it. I don't have any interest in power.'''<P>    Are you reading this in the morning? Only 48 days and about 3 hours until the first showing!</blockquote><P>
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=#01237D><B>Magic of the Myth Exhibition</B></FONT><BR>
<SMALL>Wed, Mar 31, 99 03:14:14 PM CST<P></SMALL>
A reader codenamed "Gravity Grave in Chicago" reportedly got their hands on a promotional booklet for the Star Wars - The Magic Of Myth exhibition. We haven't seen much specific info about it yet, so they toplined it for us. Here's the report:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>  The booklet is a thin 8.5x11 spiral bound affair, full color from what looks like a high-end color printer.  It came to us from the Smithsonian Institution Travelling Exhibition Service.  It touts "a major travelling exhibition beginning in September 1999."  It promises props, costumes, models,  artwork, photomurals, and interpretive panels that total up to fill approximately 1,327 square meters (5,000 sq feet).<P>  The tally goes like this:<BR>    30-35 mannequins <BR>  35-40 models <BR>  50 pieces of framed artwork <P>    Also features companion book, 30 minute documentary film (provided to exhibitor on laser disc), and interactive audio tour. Their itinerary runs as follows (venues obviously TBD): <P>    Venue 1 9/11/99-1/2/00 <BR>  Venue 2 2/12/00-6/4/00 <BR>  Venue 3 7/15/00-11/5/00 <BR>  Venue 4 12/16/00-5/8/01 <BR>  Venue 5 6/19/01-9/9/01 <BR>  Venue 6 10/20/01-2/10/02 <BR>  Venue 7 3/23/02-7/14/02 <P>    The introduction explains, "the timing of this exhibition takes advantage of the worldwide cinematic release of Episode 1, the much-awaited first installment of the second Star Wars trilogy.  The exhibition will premier several significant artifacts from the new film, making it an even greater attraction to a base of STAR WARS admirers that has been growing rapidly for more than 20 years."<P>    </BLOCKQUOTE> Interesting to see the travel plans well into the year 2002! Look for more soon from this important new source!<P>

There were some non-earth-shattering SW-related media mentions, but we thought you would be interested.<P>  Reader Geoff pointed us to a very interesting article in the <A HREF="http://www.telegraph.co.uk" target="_new">Electronic Telegraph (UK)</A> called "The story that changed a generation". (You'll need a free registration to read the article.)  <P>  Movieline asked some <A HREF="http://web3.stlnet.com/postnet/news/wires.nsf/National/1B225D59EB6B26B086256744003C73DE?OpenDocument" target="_new">celebs to name their favorite Star Wars characters</A>. They have responses from Keri Russell (Felicity), Jim Caviezel (The Thin Red Line), Freddie Prinze Jr. (She's All That), James Van Der Beek (Dawson's Creek), Ben Chaplin (The Thin Red Line), and David Boreanaz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer).  <P>  Los Angeles Daily News has a story on <A HREF="http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/007644.htm" target="_new">reactions to LFL's advance ticket sale policy</A>. Here's a clip...<BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL>  Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co., said theater chains  will probably go along with the request. "I think exhibitors will agree because they want to maintain the best  possible relationship with Lucas and Fox," he explained. "I think holding  off on advance sales is a good idea. People are going to cry foul if they  stand in line and can't get tickets because people on the phone have gotten  them all."</SMALL></BLOCKQUOTE>  Wired is carrying a similar story, "<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/18739.html" target="_new">Star Wars' Ticket Wars Averted</A>".<P>

<SMALL>Tue, Mar 30, 99 04:46:25 PM CST<P></SMALL>
Rick forwarded us the following from the New York Post  <BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL>  '60 MINS' IS SCI-FINE    by MICHAEL STARR <P>THE force of "Star Wars" creator George Lucas helped CBS' "60 Minutes" score  some solid numbers Sunday night.   <P>  Lesley Stahl's two-part interview with the reclusive Lucas was seen by 20.9  million viewers, according to preliminary national Nielsen data released  yesterday.   <P>  While those numbers helped CBS win the Sunday-night ratings race, the show was  only the seventh-highest-rated "60 Minutes" broadcast this season in terms of  total viewers.   <P>  For instance, over 25 million viewers tuned in on Jan. 17 when the show  featured reports on domestic violence in the military, a woman killed in South  Africa by the same people trying to help her, and an 11-year-old girl held in  jail without a lawyer or her parents.   <P>  Nearly 24 million viewers tuned in on Nov. 29, 1998 - one week after "60  Minutes" showed videotaped footage of Dr. Jack Kevorkian administering a  lethal injection to Thomas Youk, who was suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease.   That show, however, focused on the Y2K problem, Nazi slave labor and black  farmers in the South denied government loans.   <P>  On Sunday night's "60 Minutes," Lucas talked about the upcoming "Star Wars  Episode 1: The Phantom Menace" and showed some never-before-seen clips from  the highly anticipated movie, scheduled to open May 19.   <P>  In the second part of his interview, Lucas discussed his fiercely guarded  personal life.   <P>  Sunday's third "60 Minutes" piece focused on six jailed Iraqi dissidents  formerly backed by the CIA.</BLOCKQUOTE></SMALL><P>
