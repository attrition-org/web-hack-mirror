<P>I don't know about you, but I find most Star Wars trivia to be so 
hard that I'll never answ

er

 i

t or so easy that it's not enjoyable.  So 
the purpose of this trivia section is to be INTERESTING.  If you can answer 
the questions, GREAT!  If not, I hope you'll learn something cool
about the films which you didn't know before.  That way, everyone
gets something out of it.
