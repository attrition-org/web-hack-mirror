<br>
Dreaming of that face again.
<br>
It's bright and blue and shimmering.
<br>
Grinning wide
<br>
And comforting me with it's three warm and wild eyes.
<br>
On my back and tumbling
<br>
Down that hole and back again
<br>
Rising up
<br>
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye.
<br>
<br>
In... Out... In... Out... In... Out...

<br>
A child's rhyme stuck in my head.
<br>
It said that life is but a dream.
<br>
I've spent so many years in question
<br>
to find I've known this all along.
<br>
<br>
"So good to see you.
<br>
I've missed you so much.
<br>
So glad it's over.
<br>
I've missed you so much
<br>
Came out to watch you play.
<br>
Why are you running?"
<br>
<br>
Shroud-ing all the ground around me
<br>
Is this holy crow above me.
<br>
Black as holes within a memory
<br>
And blue as our new second sun.
<br>
I stick my hand into his shadow
<br>
To pull the pieces from the sand.
<br>
Which I attempt to reassemble
<br>
To see just who I might have been.
<br>
I do not recognize the vessel,
<br>
But the eyes seem so familiar.
<br>
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
<br>
Singing one familiar song...
<br>

<br>
So good to see you.
<br>
I've missed you so much.
<br>
So glad it's over.
<br>
I've missed you so much.
<br>
Came out to watch you play.
<br>
Why are you running away?"
<br>
Prying open my third eye.
<br>
So good to see you once again.
<br>
I thought that you were hiding.
<br>
And you thought that I had run away.
<br>
Chasing the tail of dogma.
<br>
I opened my eye and there we were.
