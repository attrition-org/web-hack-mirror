In short the peace agreenment Serbian President is being 
forced to sign said:

Serbs either give Kosovo to Albanians or Let USA control Kosovo 
(Like they control Bosnia now)
for both Serbs and Albanians. If not, you will BE BOMBED!

Milosevic (Serbian president) made a mistake by letting USA control
Bosnia, however why should Yugoslavia need USA to run Kosovo for them?
They can run their land themselves.

Kosovo Story Example:

Let's say You have a house (the house is called Serbia). I am an
Albanian and you let me live in one of your house's rooms (the room
is called Kosovo). After some time all your neighbours start hating
you and I don't want them hating mee too, so I want to move out of your
house (Serbia). Only this time I want to take the room (Kosovo) with
me. Of course you don't let me take a part of your house and you kick
me out. Then I call my big brother (NATO). He says "Give the room to
my little brother, or let me sort out things for both of you (he gets
to do whatever he wants with the room in your house)". You don't want
anyone to mess with your House so you don't let my Big Brother in. He
then kicks your ass (bombing), gets you fired from your job (bombing
of factories), kills your friends (bombing)... You still don't let him
(NATO) enter your house. So my brother keeps comming back every day
kicking your ass, crashing your house, sending Rats (Spys) into your
house, killing more of your friends,... You still don't give up, so my
Big Brother (NATO) brings his friends (more bombers, apache chopers,
land troops, etc.) to help him kick your ass even more... But Your brother
doesn't realize you will NEVER GIVE UP! Nobody can take your house, or
a part of your house from you if you are a good SERBIAN.

During this minute you were reading the example you shared a Yugoslavian
moment. You were a good Serb. Thanks for reading
