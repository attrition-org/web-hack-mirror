<font face="Arial Black,Helvetica,Sanserif" size="3">Do you know about the 
people that NATO is defending in Kosovo?  Read all about them

Don't eat everything CNN and other media outlets serve -- try some
<a href="http://www.beograd.com/nato/voz/index.html">Foreign Cuisine</a>.
The media is stronger than any army because they strive to manipulate and
control the minds of the people.
<p>
CNN is lying and hiding pictures! You got those train crash pictures from
Reuters. Serbian TV showed the whole story, but CNN didn't.  They only show
the train wreckage, but where are the dramatic corpses, burned bodies, spilled
brains, and other images that they won't show the world?
<p>
CNN won't show the massive protests in Germany, Greece, Italy, France,
Australia, or the USA. There are protests every day of over 100.000 people
but CNN won't show that to the USA citizens.
<p>
CNN won't tell the people about losses in the NATO army.  They won't tell the
people about that plane which crashed in Bosnia last night.  Why don't they
tell you about the helicopter full of NATO special soldiers which was
destroyed 2 days ago?
<p>
CNN claims to know *Everything* but it won't show the people things that
oppose the efforts of the NATO regime.
