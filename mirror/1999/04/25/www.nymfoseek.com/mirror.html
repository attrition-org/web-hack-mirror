<font size=6><center>Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God?  Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.  And that is what some of you were.  But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.<br></font>
<font size="2">(1 Corinthians 6:9-11)</font></center><br><br><font size=5 color="yellow">
Above all, God loves you.  When he sees his children hurting themselves he weeps, like any good parent would.  And he weeps when he thinks of the day when you will be judged, and he will watch you being taken away and eternally separated from him.  It doesn't have to be this way.  There is a way to him, he loved you so much he sent his son to die and remove all your sin and guilt.  It's a free gift, and it's extended to you right now, you don't have to do anything but accept it.  I can't love you nearly as much as God does, and I still never want you to see the day where you'll be led to the gates of hell.  But all I can do is lead you to the water, you must choose God yourself.  No decision is more important than this, it's the reason he made you.  He died just to talk to you, all you have to do is listen.  Listen, repent, and above all, love him.  He loves you.<br><br></font>
<center><font size=6>The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!"  And let him who hears say, "Come!"  Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.<br><font size="2">(Revelation 22:17)</font><br><br><br><br><font size="2">
