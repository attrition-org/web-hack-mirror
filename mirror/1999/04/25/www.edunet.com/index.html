<P>You know, recently I've been wondering about something. In this world
we have a profession called <B>teachers</B>. They are supposed to help
guide you through their subjects in a way that will actually teach you
and make you WANT to learn. Are they supposed to, however, make you learn
everything yourself? And then blame bad grades on you? And why...maybe
because they don't like kids, don't enjoy teaching, need the money, got
stuck teaching...that list goes on. But for whatever reason, it is still
WRONG.
<P>This is a call. A call to all teachers - to TEACH. That's right, make
it so the students like your subjects and can't wait to get more. Not so
your students watch the clock the entire time. You can't make everyone
learn, but believe me, you sure can interest a lot of people in your 
subject,
only if <B>YOU</B> <B>TEACH.</B>
<P>All teachers who don't want to be there, and make class hell for 
everybody,
I SHUN YOU.
<P>This site "defaced" by an anonymous person who hopes for better 
teachers.
This was not "elite" in any way. Administrator: Please look into fixing
your Cold Fusion holes.
<P>[ Another injustice in this country is the Kevin Mitnick case. Please
