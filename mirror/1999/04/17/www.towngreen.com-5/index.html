<p align="center">Ok,&nbsp; I ownz this site once again. Now I will make a statement. Once
I own a site dont try to hack it. Cuz if you hack it after me your really really lame cuz
that just means you dont know nothing and you have to copy someone else. It doesn't show
any of you skills if you have to take a site someone had already owned. Here are some
sites that I owned and that lame groups like United Dick Suckers took over cuz they know
shit. And they have to copy just like the other groups.</p>

<p align="center">Towngreen, Capitalcom, MBAssociates, Mini Systems, Thermatecinc and many
many more but dont want to post.</p>

<p align="center">And for the lame groups that are hacking Towngreen, U are really lame,
who ever delete all the directorys and files are fuckin stupid your not a hacker your a
lamer and the next person that does that i will post you ip address and put them in the
log files. </p>

<p align="center">And remember I was the first person to take own Towngreen. So fuck off.</p>

<p align="center">Greets to my leet friends</p>
