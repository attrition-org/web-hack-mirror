Its time for a change...<p>
Sometimes i think its all just a game...<p>
and sometimes i think its the key to fully living...<p>
Some tell me im wrong..<p>
some tell me im right...<p>
But theres always a voice that keeps us going...to learn more...to strive more...to put more effort towards learning...<p>
Im learning..i learn more everyday...and nothing is stopping me...<p>
thats because nothing can....we are unstopable...nothing can cease our exsistence...<p>
nothing...<p>
And that, my friends, is what i feel...every time i hit the power button on my machine...<p>
<p>
and yet, still i wonder....Is it worth it?<p>
But until we find out....if we ever do...we must go on...defacing websites to get our point across...because no one else cares or gives a shit about what we think...<p>
its time for a change...<p>
