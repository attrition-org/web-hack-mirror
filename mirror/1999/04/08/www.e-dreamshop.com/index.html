<h1 align="center"><font color="#FFFF33">In todays news WWW.E-DREAMSHOP.COM HACKED</font></h1>
<h1 align="center"><font color="#FFFF33">April 7, 1999</font></h1>

  Destruction </font></h1>

<h1 align="center"><font color="#FFFF33" size="3">Today another of our kind got 
  caught. It was Zyklon this time. We read the articles, we've seen the damage, 
  we do not condon it but we do accept it. First off, WE, HACKERS, ARE NOT CRIMINALS, 
  what WE ARE are explorers. We are the electronic explorers, we are the new Christopher 
  Columbus', the new Ponce De Leon and Lief Erickson. We as hackers are not out 
  there to rampage and pillage the village. We are on a quest to find knowledge, 
  though it may be locked away, we see it as our responsibilty to free it from 
  its confines. I have been fed enough of this press bull shit on how hackers 
  are evil, and criminals. Granted not everything we do is legal, but we are not 
  a burden on society. When we get arrested we are put in with the murders, rapests 
  and child molesters. You, the public and narrow minded see us as an enemy, as 
  a threat. We are not a threat, the threat lies within all of you who are stupid 
  enough to believe everything you read and see on tv or in the movies. Where 
  the hell were all of you when G.O.D was passing out the brains, were you jerking 
  yourselves the fuck off??????? Im gonna tell you all something scary, hackers 
  are everwhere. Every country, every city, every family. Hell your son or daughter 
  could be one and you won't even know it. They could of said something to you, 
  but YOU were to busy sucking off the milkman or raping the girlscout from next 
  door to listen to them. I admit to being a hacker, and guess what, IM DAMN PROUD 
  OF IT. See the way I see it is, I can do things most people can't, I can manipulate 
  a computer network, I can fuck with the phone lines, hell, I can find out where 
  YOU LIVE. bwaahahahahahhaahhahah. Whos to say im dangerous, some overpaid news 
  jockey behind a desk. Tell me something, you never hear of any good things hackers 
  do, do you? NO!! That is becuase the news does not report that kind of information. 
  If its good, don't expect to see about it on tv or in the local paper. Heres 
  a bit of information you probably didn't know. The US Government has hackers 
  working for them, thats right. They higher hackers to infiltrate other countries 
  systems and for their own security. Now why don't all you MENTAL MIDGETS go 
  learn something about us, that is, besides the negative press that we get!!</font></h1>
