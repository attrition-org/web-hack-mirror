<p>To Admin: No files were destroyed or damaged during this exercise. Your old work is at oldindex1.html. Your password was EXTREMELY easy and your associates have insecure email accounts. I hope this has been a informative, educational experience...and just think. It was free!!!!</p>

<p>  I mainly hacked this site cuz I was bored as hell and everyone else was sleepin. But also to say that John Howell is a idiot, This war is pissin me off, and I'm sick of hearing about Y2K bullshit</p>

<p> Shoutz to: Knyterage, King Dragon, Overkill, Nocx, and the rest of GoD. Also to Classofmyown, Dyno, Trish, Roc, and ZYKLON....hang in there man.</p>
