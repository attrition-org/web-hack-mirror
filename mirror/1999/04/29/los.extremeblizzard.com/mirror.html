Note to Sysadm: <BR> 
 
        Once we heard you were heading to the server, we went to your
place  
        to party. Don't worry man, after the cat clogged the toilet, we  
        plunged that bad boy down, and pissed on the rest of the carpet
so  
        it'd match the water mess.  We felt responsible man, ya know, so
we  
        made sure everything was in order. <BR><BR>
 
        PS:   Don't worry, we won't tell anyone about all that bondage  
              equip.; your secret's safe with us man.  
<BR><BR> 
Nah, I'm just messin' with you. Hey, in fact, we backed up everyones
index ;)  You've got to expect a little beating, because we did out-smart
you. Hey 
look on the bright-side! If you were in China man, they'd like casturate  
you, and rename you Wong-Gon or something.  <BR><BR>

"The Message" <Drum role><BR> 
 ===========<BR> 
 
Ah, yes -- now I will sum up the transition hacking has made. Long ago,  
there were hackers, and they'd do what it took to get their kicks,
learning along the way. Those hackers mature, start to seek legitimacy
but 
refuse to drop there "hobby," so the few looked up upon, coax the entire 
community to strive to look legitimate in the eyes of general public.
This 
aristocrasy is no more than hackers turned security consultants,
concerned 
with this process:<BR><BR> 
 
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> 
Find exploit - >  Publish exploit - > Patch exploit [LOOP]<BR><BR> 
<FONT COLOR=WHITE> 
That way they get the prestiege and maintain their "legitimacy."; I have
no _real_ problem with this, but if you put actual implementation of
exploits  
down, you blow goats. -- Hacking isn't about tracking down every bug for
Joe Smoes software co. -- It's about having fun for our amusement, and  
satisfying the need to know `What's behind this?` 
 
End point, we're having fun, maybe you should too, if you're not already.
