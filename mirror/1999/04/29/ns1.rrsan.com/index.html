Greetings kiddies. If you are looking to 
<p>
visit the San Diego Road Runner site, you can go <a href="http://www.san.rr.com">here</a>.
<p>
Road Runner's security sucks, just like Bill Clinton. I bet he 
<p>
feels like a man, fucking his interns, bombing third world 
<p>
countries, and generally being a poor president. Clinton should
<p>
have been impeached. The USA and NATO think world peace can be
<p>
forced onto the world. It can't. It takes the cooperation of
<p>
the world. Bombing countries <b>will not</b> bring peace.
<p>
NATO should keep their nose out of other people's business.
<p>
It is not our problem. The US has bigger problems other than
<p>
this stupid shit. I want to see irc.psychic.com back. It doesn't
<p>
belong as an EFNet link, although EFNet owns. psychic will always
<p>
own you. #irc.psychic.com. Oh yea, FREE KEVIN.
