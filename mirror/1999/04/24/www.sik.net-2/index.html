FREE KEVIN, no - lets bitch about the killing in colorado (You know, the two kids that went mad and shot lots of people.)</p><p>People are already trying to use the excuse that the pair were picked on and made to feel bad at school, which is why they went mad and killed a whole bunch of innocent people. Well, that is a pile of BULLSHIT.</p><p>There is <b>NO EXCUSE</b> for what those two did. They were sadistic and sick individuals who showed no remorse. They deserved to die, and I just wish it could have been even more painful for them.</p><p>Having said that, socitity is somewhat to blame - had america introduced stricter gun control many years ago, this type of incident would be far less likely to happen. If guns are harder to get, then the majority of insane people will take the easier option and use something they can get easily, like a knife. Sure, some people will still get hurt - but you <b>WONT</b> end up with 25 dead people at the end of it.</p><p>Ive heard some stupid fucking shit over this today, the most stupid thing Ive heard, on the local news, is that the tecahers should have been armed so that they could have potentially shot the killers themselfs.</p><p>Thats SUCH A FUCKING STUPID IDEA its hardly believeable. As well as expecting them to teach a bunch of assholes you feel they should be loaded up ready to kill them if they go mad? Thats shit and you KNOW it.</p><p>Anyway, this is a non-ending rant so I will slowly drift away into nothing.</p><p>Respects:</p><p>Jordan Lee - Still my best buddie, love you.<br>Jan Lee - Still scary, love you too.<br>Madsmurf - Your still the dude.<br>Indica - *drool*, your hot.<br>Attrition - Carloyn is still a whore.<br>2600 - Your websites ugly, fix it.<br>Slashdot - Taco, respect for your work.<br>Freshmeat - Scoop, you may be a hairy german but we luv you.<br>Raster - You write some mad shit, E owns our minds.<br>Clinton - Violence is not the answer - SO WHY ARE YOU BOMBING SERBIA, IDIOT?<br>Mudhoney - Gimme that guttermouth shit, bastard.<br>Stuart Luscombe - Youre a horny trip.<br>Spacecrew - Hey d00ds.<br>Full AxX - Keep up the code.<br>Alan Cox - AC patchs own me. Your wifes ugly tho.</p><p>Disrepects:</p><p>Danny-boy - I hate you, I will always hate you - you are the lamest prick I have ever met, I wish you would burn up and die a slow and painful death. I hope rabid animals rip off your flesh and piss over your dying body.</p><p>Bill Gates - Fine businessman, but you make the worlds worst software, you have the money to change that. Do it.</p><p>James Toovey - Your fat and you smell funny. Wash sometimes, ok?</p><p>People of Turkey - Bow down to your Greek superiors.<br></p></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
