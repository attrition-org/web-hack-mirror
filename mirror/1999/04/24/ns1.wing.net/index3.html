<font size=4>Top 10 reasons why JP <b>sucks</b> . . .
<br>
<br>
</center>
1. they steal people's code, strip out their name and replace with their own 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"antionline" banner. just like rootshell.
<br>
<br>
2. in the face of no news, they resort to libelous opinionated articles ghost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written by others. (ie: puppet)
<br>
<br>
3. claims to be a first with the happy hacker wargame crap, even though these 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contests have been going on for over a decade.
<br>
<br>
4. maintains a database on hackers and their claims while having close ties with the 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FBI and other informants.
<br>
<br>
5. offers no legitimate products or services that are new or original. like countless 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other sites, AO is nothing more than a leech point for other people's hard work.
<br>
<br>
6. "I'm not a hacker" then represents the hacker subculture in media articles and 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTV specials.
<br>
<br>
7. What little news is released is poorly written, lacks research, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hypes simple events (milworm, LOU, etc)
<br>
<br>
8. sellout. once spoke out against charlatans like Carolyn Meinel, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now works for them.. Money talks.
<br>
<br>
9. John Vranasevich
<br>
<br>
10. JP starts rumors and backstabs simply to get people worked up, all in order to write more pathetic news.
