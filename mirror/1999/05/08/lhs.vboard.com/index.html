If my demands are not met in five (that is f-i-v-e for all you
hooked on phonics students) days, I will hack a server a day
until it is. This is the lamest web site I have ever seen. These
people really suck at HTML. This IS a personal hack. I hate the
teachers at this school. They are all pricks. Especially Mr. Andrews.
He is da admin of the school's leet Novell network (he pheers me).
Mr. Andrews: You need to mind your own fucking business. You shouldn't
poke your nose into other people's business. Yes, I am talking about the
Lindsey W. incident. Not to mention, you accusing me of hax0ring your
precious network (tee hee). Next on the agenda is Mr. Wessel. You are just
a lame teacher. You know shit about computers. You try to act like you
know everything about computers and how they work. Too bad I spend most
of my class time explaining shit to you. Mr. Hunter. You're a washed up
retired minor league bench warming wannabe computer teacher. Finally, there
is Mrs. Hund. You're a fat wh0re. You know absolutely jack shit about
computers. I guess that is why you teach word processing. "Enter, space,
space, enter, enter your name". You compliment me on my computer skillz
so you don't piss me off and make me hax0r the network. I think it is pretty
funny.
