        <p>Well I know hacking is not about changing and defacing a site. Some 
          people can say what I did was wrong or the act of a Skipt Kiddie and 
          they are entitled to their opinion. I just<br>
          want to let you know that no harm was caused by this breach of security. 
          I only did this<br>
          to bring the flaws to the attention of the web master. I would Like 
          to just say Sorry guys<br>
          but I am sure if I would have come to you and told you that you had 
          hole you would have<br>
          told me to prove it. Well this is just a way of showing you that you 
          had a bug. I used a <br>
          simple exploit that has been around for awhile to get in. I would suggest 
          that you go to<br>
          cert and do some research on SunOS and patch it up. Your page has been 
          saved <a href="indexback.html">here</a> <br>
          all you need to do is rename it back to index.html<br>
