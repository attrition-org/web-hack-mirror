I thought for a long time about what to label this hacked site,
and what information I should have on the topics that I believe
in. The answer I came up with, didn't impress me. I really should
be doing this for all the innocent victims that died in Denver.
But, I do not know enough about the subject to do a whole page on
it. I know that I copied ne0h's page. But with his
acknowledgement.<br>

<p>In the suburbs of Denver CO.. two masked gunmen, opened fire
in a highschool, killing dozens of harmless students, and
injuring many more. They tossed explosives, and shot at students
at point blank range, laughing and enjoying it all. This is an
outrage, how can someone do this to people they knew, or dont
even know? Revenge is one thing.. but hunting down, and killing
dozens of innocent teenagers?<br>

As people, we must stop this! This is not acceptable. We're
asking parents to please pay a little more attention to what
their kids are doing! We can't afford to let this happen any
more! This is not a joke, kids are killing and doing it in cold
blood. I don't see how someone can kill someone else, let alone
kill more than one person. The media is being blamed on what
happened. I blame parents, you see, parents are the ones that
should be knowing whats going on in their kids' life. The parents
should have seen that something was wrong. <br>

else! Talk to your kids about this! This is not funny nor
acceptable. Yet some kids believe that what they did was
&quot;cool&quot; and well-planned. This can not keep happening.
We, as human beings can not teach our kids to do this. We can't
let it happen! The shooting was being blamed on Marilyn Manson,
Rammstein, Hitler, and others. This is beside the fact that these
two kids had a mental illness. No one on earth, that is sane, can
shoot people and laugh while they are doing it. I think these
kids had less going for them than we though. I hope other's agree
that there was a mental illness in effect for this.<br>

<p>I'm sorry to the administrator, I didn't mean to cause any
trouble. Your server was very badly misconfigured. Please fix the
configuration, so no malicious people have the chance to do
damage. I want you to know that no files were deleted during this
whole thing. I wasn't going to change the page, but you guys
didn't pay attention to the people logging in. I gave you plenty
of time to reconfigure. Your original work is found at
'default2.htm'. Remember, this was not a malicious attack, only
to let the public know my feelings on the subject.<br>
