<I>sorry mr.admin...you have holes that should have

<P><B>By now, I am sure everyone has heard about the Colorado shootings.
But have you heard of the impact it has on schools? At local schools, students
don't show up because of people saying there will be another shooting.
At my school, we had a fake bomb threat, so people can have an execuse
to ditch and party. It made 1,800 people stay out of school. This tactic
is <I>sick. </I>Anyone who is trying to use this tactic to get out of school,
you are sick bastards.</B><B></B>
<P><B>To our esteemed leader, President Clintler....how can kids learn
that violence is bad when you are bombing the hell out of Kosovo? You blame
the media and TV for bad youths, but what exactly is on TV that is violent?
That's right, President Clintler talking about how he plans to bomb Kosovo
more and more. And don't even attempt to talk about family values and good
morals. You are a "poster child" for an Anti-Morals Campaign.</B><B></B>
