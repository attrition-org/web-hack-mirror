The Web has been created by millions of people just like you. Simply because
they want to create. Without need, greed, fear, hierarchy, authority figures,
ethnic identification, religion, or any other form of manipulation. Nothing
like this ever happened before in history. It is a whole new dimension of
human potential. There are no limits here. There are no bounds. Reach out and touch
millions of people.
