     Today, we are here to talk about a couple facts of life... Justice... And revenge.<br><br>

     Justice, such a beautiful word... Such a beautiful meaning... Such a beautiful illusion. Perhaps you believe that the juridiction system is perfect, that there are no flaws, or hardly any. We're here to change your mind about that.<br>
     Last year, a man robs 34 people of over 100, 000$ each, some of which lost their house, others of which lost everything. How did he do this? By means of franchises, selling them using papers that described fake incomes. People look at the incomes, amazed by how much profit they are going to make once the store is bought... Amazed even more once they bought it, and noticed they're in the red by thousands, some even millions.
This man was then brought to court, and sentenced to... Nothing. Nada. Why? He declared bankrupt, personnal and buisness, thus had to pay nothing, and didnt even go to jail.
This man caused so many people to divorce, to loose their house and everything in them, and to commit suicide, yet he was sentenced to nothing.<br>
     Another time, a man creates a virus. You probebly heard of Melissa, right? A harmless virus, that simply reproduces. This man has caused no deaths and has not made people loose everything. And you know what happened? He got 40 years in jail, and had to pay 500, 000$US. So now tell me... Has your view on justice changed?<br><br>

     Now about revenge. A few years ago, a girl gets raped. She's beautiful, friendly... and a child. The man who raped her happened to work at her school. He was thrown out of many states previously, because he was procecuted for child abuse... Yet never prooved guilty. After having raped her, he attempted to kill her, yet without success. The girl was a witness of the rape, for she was the victim. The man was the only person in the school, and thus no one else could have raped her. <br>
     At court, this man was prooven not-guilty (Another example of poor justice?). The mother was so infuriated, she took out a gun from her purse, and shot the man. He later died of the gunshot. She was sentanced to 6 years in prison, for having murdered a psychopathic rapist. Revenge. Justice. Dont they just fit together like a map of lies?
<br><br>

     We are here to revenge for all the wrongs that have been done to all the citizens of every country. We are here to fight for justice towards the lies we have been told. Help us revenge the illusion of justice... You dont want <i>your</i> kids to grow up in a justice-free world do you?
