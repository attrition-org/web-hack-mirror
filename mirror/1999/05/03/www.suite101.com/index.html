*Cough*. Ahem. Regarding the Littleton shootings, and school shootings in general. WHY THE HELL ARE THEY STILL HAPPENING?

Perhaps, just maybe, the fact that people, parents, and society will always blame someone else. It's the gun control laws! No, it's television! No, it's the evils of the internet! Let's blame the fucking propane companies for providing means to make propane bombs, too! AND BURLINGTON COAT FACTORY FOR THOSE EVIL TRENCH COATS! DONT FORGET id Software FOR MAKING DOOM, AND NINTENDO TOO!

Hey, I play Doom, Quake, and everything in between. So do millions of others. And yet I don't kill. I surf the internet several hours a day. And yet, I still don't kill people. I watch violent R-rated movies like The Matrix, and yet, I don't kill people. I get fucking IRATE at the idiots that run my school, but I keep it to myself.

WAKE THE FUCK UP PEOPLE!
The media, music, movies, and matrix isn't to blame. Kids who kill other students are disturbed need to have therapy and counseling before something horrible like Littleton occurs. Parents, it is your job to watch for the signs. Talk to your kids, get inside their heads. See if something is troubling them. Communication with your teen is key to a stable, mental well-being.

Stop pointing fingers, and start looking around. The true solution to teen violence is right under your nose.
