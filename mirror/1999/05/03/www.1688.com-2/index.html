<p>Team Spl0it -  I myself have been talking to f0bic, this fued is over.  It was childish and had no point and wouldn't have ended unless we became mature and talked it over.  I hope this will help us both in learning from stupid mistakes.  War is not for educational benefits, so why do it.  Especially if the two groups are of the same rank.  Hope you go about with your business as will we and take care.  f0bic i love you and keep on doing what you do.

<p>ant1-secur1ty taskforce -  Honestly the most pathetic group of kids since milw0rm.  You give hacking/phreaking groups bad names with your stupid hackerish talk with your little numbers and you have the most stupid name for a group i've seen ever.  You didn't start doing shit until this cold fusion shit came out for you windows kids eh?  I did a cold fusion just for you guys, because i know how you can't access anything else but windows machines.  Below you will find a msg to ben, your founder/fagget or whatever you wish to call him, he who leads you in the windows direction and shows you the light of mole.cfm.  You honestly think you are a match for gH and itz aquantences?  If so, i would love to meet each of you on irc somewhere, anywhere, i could care less, just to talk to you guys and see how much you really know.  In my point of view, i'll guess you know shit about linux nor anything non-windows related.  Probably don't even understand how the cold fusion exploit works and why it does work!  So basically, you are using a windows exploit that you don't know shit about, but has been out for months now.  I have a feeling this is in retaliation to team spl0it, which if you didn't read above has talked out itz differences and spl0it can take up for themselves, but you have crossed the line.  Give reason with your ethics of shit talking.  Atleast i have the nuts/skill/backup to call whoever out i want and i have facts to base my statements on.  Just because i can do this, don't mean i will call every fucking group out, but the chosen lame ones who think they can just jump up when a new exploit comes out and bump the old ones off, i laugh in your kids faces.  You will die out when you run out of windows boxes and when a linux exploit comes out, you will have nothing to run it off of. HEH, and ben, have fun reading below, you will love it.

<p>About this site -  Btw, this is the second time this site has been compromised, thankx to mindphasr i can do it again.  I have only one thing to say in a long sentence.  This machine was compromised using the cold fusion lame exploit, but Bank Information was taken to show the admin he shouldn't leave such information in plain site on a network over the internet, warez was found and kept due to the fact using cracking programs to crack registration codes/locks on costly programs is also illegal and the router login i have with the passwd 'superman' which i found in plain txt, now this was the funnies shit i've ever found, either keep your shit encrypted or don't keep it over the internet at all. peace.

Now this above isn't legal i don't beleive and is being looked into.  Benie boi, you should learn to be legit if you have something going for you.  I hope you didn't card that domain, that wouldn't be good.  If you get caught for carding you know you have to pay for every CC# they find on your machine.  Sucks when you have a database of them and you get busted.  You are a skillless bitch as well, i noticed you are in other groups as well and your skills state you as having "bot skills" <- wtf is this.  Making bots takes skill?  Must be a new era of hackers these days with great eggdrop/mech skills in the year 2000 to come i will fear the internet with ./hack bots. HEH  NeUA is a neat group, but why did they choose you to be "co-founder" of them when i knew them from when they chilled in #resolve when all that shit was attempting to come together.  To bad little kids had to fuck it up, but i tried.  Come on benie, i know you can post more then lame fucking cold fusion hacks or are you too pathetic or scared to log into something you can't clean your logs off of?  You probably didn't know cold fusion logged did you?  I'm surprised you can find the HTML, i noticed some of your friends in a few logs and it was funny, because i knew that it was some of your doings, because you would browse around and couldn't find the default.htm file, because it was on another HD, which you don't understand how to use Cold Fusion to access other hard disks, but oh well, that is you guys lose or just showing plain stupidity.  I'm gonna find you Ben, it won't take long trust me.  I'm gonna fuck your world up until you with you never played war games.  I"ll take it to a level to where you wont' understand the rules, reason being, there will be no rules.  Me and you Ben.  Come on, you are something we think we are correct.  Show it, before i find out who you really are and really have fun with your lame pathetic ass.  San Diego is big, but not many people run the webpage and it won't take long to find you, have fun and i hope you get a legit domain soon, this one sd2600.net will be gone soon.  Fuck you skillLess bitches and especially Ben for running a stupid webpage, going to the most pathetic meeting in the world and fucking with the wrong people; have fun......
