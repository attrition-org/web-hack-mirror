Don't even try to tell us what to do. We own you, and we own gH. We are the
masters of the internet, we are everywhere and everything. DISO watch out
for us, because we're coming, and when we do, you better run, because you
script kiddies wont last a second. You made a grave mistake threatening us
tonight, and you'll pay for it. We are what you think you are.
