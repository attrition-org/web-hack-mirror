<title>is that the feds i hear knocking at my door?</title>
<hr>
hey whats up....errr, hold on,  my elite friend 'fred' needs some porn,  i
just rooted a porn page so i'll brb while i make him an account........ok,
where were we?  oh yes,  well, while he's off doing....um,  yea...lets
continue shall we?  well,  today just fucking(i did hack this,  i do have
the right to cuss don't i?) sucked.  i take the day off from work so i can
hook up and spend time with this girl i really really like,  AND SHE CAN
ONLY COME OVER FOR AN HOUR BECAUSE HER EX IS COMING TO VISIT HER.  the
reason why she didn't want to get involved with me before?  BECAUSE HIS D
UMBASS IS SUICIDAL AND WANTS TO KILL HIMSELF SO SHE SPENDS TIME WITH HIM.
but then i finally get her and my mother,  MY GODDAMN MOTHER!  comes in
and starts talking about kids killing each other at school,  they didn't
like my theory about thining the herd....53 minutes later,  im half asleep
when my mom goes to make dinner,  and of course,  she has to go to her
ex's.  sigh.  ok,  now i know what your thinking 'h3y th1s 1sn't wh4ts 0n
h3r3'  your right.  my good friends let me um,  borrow i guess,  this
shell.  because as insecure as it was,  i wouldn't classify it as actually
trying to keep me out.  oh well.  and to think,  i waste my days away
washing dishes making minimum wake while the guys that run this place make
3-5x that much.  ok.  let me give you a quick example.  if you have no use
for a program or daemon or anything,  DON'T HAVE IT ON YOUR MACHINE OR
RUNNING.  example,  when you installed redhate,  i noticed you left every
damn thing open.  i mean,  status is a neat toy to play with.   oh well.
damnit,  my fatass is hungry now.  someone hack pizzahut.com or
dominos.com or better yet,  someone card a pizza to my house....send to
care of Chris Dumas

anyways...while im waiting on that pizza....there's a few things i gotta
get off my chest.  whats up with all the media hyping this columbine or
whatever shooting.  saying 'its the parents fault'  bullshit.  how many of
you as kids actually were open enough to where your parents would notice.
personally if i was going to go blow up my school,  i would have been more
orginized,  lots more dead,  esp those damn christian,  anyways....its not
because of tv,  its not because of music,  its because of the conditions
that these kids were raised in.  it was there surroundings.  they weren't
influenced by watching a movie and saying 'hey thats cool,  lets do it
too'  sure,  some of thought about it....but then 2.037 seconds later you
would say 'hmm,  no,  that'd suck'  and what kind of rant would this be if
i didn't preach on about my anti-canada propagada?

LETS INVADE CANADA!  ALL CANADIANS NEED TO DIE (with the exepction of one,
WaR[GoD],  he's cool and can live,  he'll help us)  let me guess....you
want an excuse to invade canada? alanis morressette.  'nuff said.  i have
more reasons,  selling toilets with illegally sized water tanks....inturn
wasting our water,  and not only that...but..well,  i'll save more of that
rant for later.

ok,  i'll finish this up soon.

now,  i know all of the 'elite hackers' on irc all listen and love rap
(*caugh* gay *caugh*) but you what?  i can't stand it.  here's my saying i
borrowed from nate:

rap is gay:  is that good freestyle?  is it flowing?

my main gripe right now (other then i can't get laid...maybe if i was
offline more and stayed away from work i could....eh)  is that fear
factory is on the second stage of ozzfest.  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
THINKING?  PUTTING DEFTONES AND GODSMACK ON THE MAIN STAGE AND PUTTING
FEAR FACTORY ON THE SECOND?  am i the only one to see whats wrong with
this?  fear factory fucking owns those bands.  iwould rather pay $50 and
see fear factory then pay $20 and see deftones and godsmack.  if anyone
anywhere remotely close to mr osbourne see's this....CHANGE THE BILL,
FEAR FACTORY IS BETTER THEN ANY KORN WANNABE BANDS THAT WILL EVER BE
HEARD.  i mean,  damn,  system of a down, deftones, godsmack....is this a
tribute to korn?  please for the love of all thats left in this slowly
dying last breed of powerful, strength inducing, agressive, energy
explosive brand of music put fear factory before any of those wannabe
korn bands.  i mean,  this is a metal concert,  manson didn't deserve to
be there before,  and SoD and deftones don't deserve to be here now.  open
your eyes.  get biohazard back.  get pantera, get megadeth,  go out with a
mother fucking bang.  make woodstock look like a tea party.  its the last
concert with ozzy and black sabbath.  if this does go down like this,  it
will truely be a sad day for metal.  please

damn i feel like im in school...hmm,  speaking of which i gotta start soon
again, blah.

i know most people put shout outs on there page to make there friends feel
elite,  like the just climbed mount everest or something.  i'll do it
cause im extremely tired and have work tomorrow (washing dishes, go
figure)  so  i'll leave a little vague shout out list before i go on efnet
and sleep.


hi's goto:

to fred the elite tree hacker
all my paranoid friends out there(you know who you are)
only about 3 people on efnet....90% (including myself) are lame script
kiddies that don't even run an *nix os.  hell,  half of them probably
can't spell it.(that goes out to myke, vango, lusta, among others)

die_you_son_of_a_motherless_goat:

everyone who's smurfed me
  


blah,  its late,  im going to sleep now,  any objections...no?

oh,  fear the bread...and

since people probably already know who i am,  why not paste a nice little
quote:

[ryan-(phear@sdn-ar-002flmelbP324.dialsprint.net)] how do i ftp to a
rlogin shell?


[anarchee(anarchee@ip3.pontiac.mi.pub-ip.psi.net)] fuck, is imapd scanning 
illegal?


(see what i mean about elite script kiddies on irc?)
