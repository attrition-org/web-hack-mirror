    <p align="left">Yes, it is us, the Federal Bureau of
    Investigation. You all thought that we were a Federal Agency.
    You thought wrong. We are actually a group of elite hackers.
    We had you all fooled. You stupid Americans. You should learn
    to be more aware of this kind of shit. Sure, most of us are
    gay, but I don't judge my fellow FBI hackers by their cover.</p>
    <p align="left">As for gH, we will own you all. We already
    locked up most of your members. There aren't too many left.
    p0gO, I know you are elite and all, but you are next. You
    really want to know who hacked <a
    href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">www.whitehouse.gov</a>? Look
    at our skill:</p>
    <p align="left">[jscott@fbi.gov ~]$ telnet www.whitehouse.gov<br>
    Trying 198.137.240.91...<br>

    Connection closed by foreign host.<br>
    [jscott@fbi.gov ~]$</p>
    <p align="left">Bahahaha. WE HACKED THE WHITEHOUSE! We just
    thought we would cover our asses and blame it on hackers.
    That is the best cover in the world. There are my *.gov sites
    to be owned...soon.</p>
