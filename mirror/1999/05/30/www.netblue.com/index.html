On with the show, another one bites the dust. Does anybody
else here realize that a lot of domains are being hit here?
I dunno if it is the webmasters fault anymore, it seems the 
pages don't stop coming! Don't hate us for who we are. Don't
hate us period, we aren't against you. We are with you. Show
us some support, prove that all hackers can get along. Don't
bad-mouth other groups or people. They know that you don't 
like them, so don't prove it to the rest of us, let us have
the freedom of choice to ourselves. Keep the true hacker spirit
alive.<p>
