<p><font face="Courier New" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Security? I think not(blah blah this
system was comprimised by gH). It's time, time groups unite as one, instead of fighting
eachother, fight as one. I'm sure you've heard all this shit before, but have you ever
thought about it?.&nbsp; We would be unstopable. Right now your sitting infront of your
computer thinking to yourself, `webhacks are useless and gay.` But that's how I get
through to people, talk all the shit you want. I could easily make a list of fuck-you's on
this page, which would cause nothing but group tention, but I have a motive. gH, MoD,
forpaxe, team spl0it, High tech hate, Defiance, stonehenge crew etc.should link. I could
go on all day naming groups, Im sure a member from each group knows one from another talk
about it.<blink>infamous/gH</blink></strong></font></p>
