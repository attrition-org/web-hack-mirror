<b>sad but true, freedom is an illusion</b><br><br>
you can do next to nothing today without your so-called superiours knowing<br>
the time, the place, the reason and the shoes you were wearing. what happened<br>
to the right for privacy ?<br>
take, for example, the pentium 3 chip. yes, i know we talked about that before,<br>
but intel claimed the problem was fixed and the number could be hidden if<br>
wanted.<br>
now, the people from <a href="www.zero-knowledge.org">zero-knowledge</a> developed a<br>
program that shows the number can still be revealed - still without any knowledge of the user.<br>
so, you'd think intel would fix it, but noooooooo...<br>
they made the program come on the list of some widespread virusscanner, thus<br>
making the user believe the program created by <a href="www.zero-knowledge.org">zero knowledge</a> is <br>
malicious. smooth move. this is what the big companies do all the time.<br><br>
i would be extremely happy if i could deface a page with a message like<br>
"FREEDOM EXISTS" or something, but i don't think that'll happen in the future.<br><br>
i wish orwell was still alive. if he'd see this, he'd understand that big<br>
brother is no longer watching, but acting.<br><br>
<h1>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT FOR PRIVACY</h1><br>
don't let them take it away from you<br><br>
