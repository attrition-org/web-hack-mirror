well , hmm, just the hell of it I imagine.&nbsp; Ok heres the deal, i cant think of shit

<table border="0" cellPadding="0" cellSpacing="3" width="500">

  <tr>
    <td vAlign="top"><p align="center"><font face="arial,helvetica" size="2">She don't care
    about my car<br>
    She don't care about my money<br>
    And that's real good cause I don't got alot to spend<br>
    But if I did it wouldn't mean nothin' </p>
    <p align="center">She likes me for me<br>
    Not because I look like Tyson Beckford<br>
    With the charm of Robert Redford<br>
    Oozing out my ears<br>
    But what she sees<br>
    Are my faults and indecisions<br>
    My insecure conditions<br>
    And the tears upon the pillow that I shed </p>
    <p align="center">She don't care about my big screen<br>
    Or my collection of DVD's<br>
    Things like that just never mattered much to her<br>
    Plus she don't watch too much TV </p>
    <p align="center">And she don't care that I can fly her<br>
    To places she ain't never been<br>
    But if she really wants to go I think deep down she knows that<br>
    All she has to say is when </p>
    <p align="center">She likes me for me<br>
    Not because I hang with Leonardo<br>
    Or that guy who played in 'Fargo'<br>
    I think his name is Steve<br>
    She's the one for me<br>
    And I just can't live without her<br>
    My arms belong around her<br>
    And I'm so glad I found her once again<br>
    And I'm so glad I found her once again<br>
    And I'm so glad I found her once again<br>
    Gazing at the ceiling as we entertain our feelings in the dark<br>
    The things that we're afraid of are gonna show us what we're made of in the end </p>
    <p align="center">She likes me for me<br>
    Not because I sing like Pavorotti<br>
    Or because I'm such a hottie<br>
    I like her for her<br>
    Not because she's phat like Cindy Crawford<br>
    She has got so much to offer<br>
    Why does she waste all her time with me<br>
    There must be something there that I don't see </p>
    <p align="center">She likes me for me<br>
    Not because I'm tough like Dirty Harry<br>
    Make her laugh just like Jim Carrey<br>
    I'm like the Cable Guy<br>
    But what she sees<br>
    Is that I can't live without her<br>
    My arms belong around her<br>
    And I'm so glad I found her once again<br>
    Found her once again<br>
    I'm so glad I found her once again<br>
    Once again </p>
