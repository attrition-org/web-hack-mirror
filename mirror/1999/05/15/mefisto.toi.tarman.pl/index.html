is it just me, or is it really fucked up that the secret service or
whoever the fucks are can arrest someone just for using the name zyklon? i
mean.. they take his name off some hacked sites, go on irc and /whois
zyklon, get a warrant, and take him to jail. end of story. oh yes this
definatly makes him GUILTY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT :P what ever happened
to INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY? using the name zyklon on irc *hardly*
makes him guilty of anything! half the time i have to wait for my nick on
irc because some other faggot has it! oh yeah to any fed reading this, i
also demand that you give zeronine and diesl0w their computers back OR
ELSE@#%! i want to see zyklon, diesl0w, and zeronine back online within a
week, or you can expect some more gH world domination.<hr>
