<p align="left"><font size="3">This page is <strong>default.htm</strong> and when you
replace it with your content, it will be lost, so we have saved a second copy under the
name <a href="digexwelcome.htm">digexwelcome.htm</a>. Some documents that may be of
interest to you, detailing some of the included features and enhancements are listed here:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">This machine is running <strong>Microsoft Internet
Information Server 3.0</strong> (IIS 3.0) with <strong>Active Server Pages</strong>. You
can use Microsoft® Active Server Pages (ASP) to embed scripts within your HTML pages to
create dynamic, interactive content for your Web site. In the past, scripts written in the
popular scripting languages VBScript and JScript have been processed by Web browsers that
support the language in which the script was written. Active Server Pages enables your Web
server to process VBScript and JScript commands. Any browser that can contact your Web
server, regardless of its support for VBScript or JScript, can work with ASP and the
dynamic output. Modules are being developed that will allow other scripting languages to
be plugged in to the server allowing the server to speak those languages (including Perl)
with the same fluency. <a href="/iasdocs/aspdocs/roadmap.asp">Read Microsoft's docs on
ASP.</a> Or try out an <a href="/Advworks/default.asp">ASP enabled site.</a> </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Go back to the ASP docs page, look at the search button at
the top right, see it? That search button calls the form that uses the <strong>Index
Server 1.1</strong>, another part of IIS 3.0, to search through all the ASP documentation
for hits. You can use this same engine to search your content almost anywhere on your
server by using this <a href="samples/indexserver/Samples/Search/QUERYHIT.HTM">more
general form</a>. After you read the <a
href="samples/indexserver/srchadm/help/DEFAULT.HTM">Product Documentation</a> on Index
Server you'll be ready to give your users queries tailored to their interests. Index
server is a simple concept, but very deep in its capabilities. For example, it's not
limited just to text or html files. It can read and understand the content in Word Docs
and Excel spreadsheets and include them in your indexes. I'm sure you'll appreciate these <a
href="samples/indexserver/srchadm/help/install.htm#Samples">samples</a>. It can even be
administered <a href="srchadm/admin.htm">online</a> (you will need the password.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Until you get fluent with ASP, you may have existing
scripts that run with <strong>Perl 5.0</strong>. We think you'll be very happy with the
performance of Perl under NT, especially if you use the Perl ISAPI dll. You can read an
overview of the NT implementation that is included with your Digex NT Series Web Server <a
href="samples/perldocs/digexstdperl5.htm">here.</a> Or you techie folks can go right to
the <a href="/samples/perldocs/default.htm">manual.</a></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Less experienced, and even more experienced, people may
want to check out Microsoft's FrontPage, the easiest way we know of to quickly create high
quality, dynamic web content. You can get a copy of FrontPage almost <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage">anywhere</a>, start it up and point it at your
webserver here. Your FrontPage application communicates with the <strong>FrontPage Server
Extensions</strong> we have installed on this server. Once you've logged in, creating your
web looks and feels just like using Microsoft Word. You can add links, tables, images,
search engines, discussion groups, as easily as typing. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">But wait, there's <strong>more!</strong> Once you've
created your dynamic, interactive pages, you'll want to see where people are spending
their time on your website. At Digex, we report on your <strong>statistics nightly</strong>
using a commercial Web Stats package, and our reports are <a href="stats/">available here</a>
(password, please.) </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">To actually <a href="samples/addcontent.htm">administer the
server and install content</a>, you'll need to connect to it. You can use Frontpage or FTP
as mentioned earlier. More sophisticated users may need to get a Netbios connection. To do
so, you have two choices. If you have Windows NT 4.0 you can use whatever Internet
connection is available to you and then use PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling Protocol) to
tunnel through the Internet and connect directly and securely with the server at Digex. (<a
href="samples/pptp/default.htm">How to PPTP is here</a>.(big document, 240kb, print it out
and have it next to you while you configure PPTP.) Microsoft has <a
href="http://backoffice.microsoft.com/downtrial/moreinfo/win95pptp.asp">free PPTP drivers</a>
for Windows 95. We have <a href="samples/win95Dialin.htm">some tips</a> on configuring
Win95 to connect to your server. Regardless of which client machine you have, read this
note on <a href="samples/win95Dialin.htm#Shares Available only with Netbios connection">Netbios
shares</a> available to you.&nbsp; Please read <a href="samples/notes.htm#User">this note</a>
on user accounts on your machine.&nbsp; We have also put a fair number of utilities in a
share called digexadmin.&nbsp; You will need a Netbios connection to get to this share,
once you're there, please read the file rktools.hlp for a description of those utilities.
&nbsp; And read this note on <a href="samples/notes.htm#Good Web Development Practices">Good
Web Development Practices.</a></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">We have one more feature for you. Most people need to be
able to <strong>SendMail</strong> from their website. Here's a sample <a
href="samples/email.htm">email form</a> that will only work if you have a SMTP mail
service installed. It's only configured to mail to me (<a href="mailto:adam@digex.net">adam@digex.net</a>)but
it demonstrates the idea. If you think you can use this, just email me and we'll make the
changes necessary. This is freeware and not supported or endorsed by Digex, but if you
find it useful, and want to use it, it seems to work. You can download the <a
href="samples/wsendmail.zip">zip file</a> and read the source code and docs. The folks at
NetOne have written a <a href="http://www.onechoice.com/formmail.html">Perl script</a>
that works in conjunction with this program.</font></p>
