&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b><font size=+2>D</font></b>on't panic, nothing has been destroyed or deleted. I would like to thank the people of Microsoft for their wonderful networking software (sarcasm), and to all those web hosting services that overcharge people, and myself for doing what I do. Further more, I would like to give shouts those bastards at 2600 (love the mag btw), l0pht, and CDC. More shouts to my boi Beta. <b>SORRY JAG, FORGIVE MY TEMPER...</b>
