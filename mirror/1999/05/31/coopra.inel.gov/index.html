At this moment and for what we know, F0rpaxe is the only Portuguese group that is executing massive attacks on edu, gov , mil, com,servers. Maybe this is the reason why F0rpaxe is now being wanted by PJ (Portuguese police) and some international organizations like FBI and Interpol. While we had been<br>away for a few days we had watch several events on the Portuguese media whitch in a certain way implicates F0rpaxe.<br>Some newspapers reported that PJ is now doing their homework together with FBI to lock down &quot;Hackers&quot; who aleggely are involved on US hacks. <br>Also PJ is now our BIG BROTHER since they are gathering efforts to make a net surveillence over POrtugual. For what it seems they have the help of<br>Portuguese ISP's like Telapac. Their goal is to track down hackers...<br>In an article of &quot;EuroNoticias&quot; they call hackers to the ones who use trojans<br>to steal accounts (l0l). If PJ thinks that this is their biggest problem then <br>that info about working together with the FBI is a bulshit...<br>Portugal is now passing through serious or hilarious actions.. IF the goal<br>of PJ is to track down people who use trojans to steal accounts then they<br>have to arrest all population. We think that this isn't their main goal <br>since F0rpaxe had been informed that PJ is trying to get solide proofs<br>that we are the responsables for all those hacks.<br>PJ doesn't scare anyone.<br>IF FBI is really working together with PJ then they are doing this only because<br>of us...most certainly to erase us from the system...<br>FBI had been mounting schemes to track us down....<br>FBI had already tried to pretend being Iron-Lungs to get info about our current hacks,<br>if we still had acess to gov servers, if we had copyed military databases and all<br>that sort of things...<br>The real I-L reported that the fake I-L wasn´t him. <br>The guy was always asking things and we just ignored...it could be just<br>a lamer trying to get some info about us...<br>But then the attemptives to track us down started: the guy started to contact<br>people who are closed to F0rpaxe ,like some fo attrition staff, in order<br>to get our contact like phone etc...<br>They even asked some of them to phone us....<br>When they realized that we had discover they started trying to get info<br>from all those who surround us...a few days later an article on a newspapper<br>reported that FBI and PJ were (or are?) working together...<br>We don't know if all this is the truth or only a misunderstanding but one<br>thing we know FBI really want us bad and they will do anything to caught us.<br>We think that FBI doesn't want us just because of all the hacks but to show<br>that they have the authoritie to arrest hackers of other country's.<br>Although they need the permissions of the government and that isn't easy.<br>They should be tired of making American Hackers life miserable and now they<br>want to do the same with us.......<br>As we told before we had been away for a while because things were starting to<br>be pretty bad… <br><br></font><font face="Times New Roman" size=2><B>Groups who work on the shadow<br></B></font><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Some groups just disappear but they don't disappear trully..They start working<br>on the shadow because FEDS are always ready to take them down...We thought<br>that it would't happen that with us but sooner or later we will need to<br>go back to where we belong...to the shadow.<br>We also take this chance to show our support with people who are now<br>facing legal troubles, like I-L, dk, Zyklon.....Kevin and all the others who<br>will face them in the future… gH has also our support.<br><br></font><font face="Times New Roman" size=2><B>Information in Portugal <br></B></font><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Portuguese media isnït aware of all this.... neither some admins who were&nbsp; <br>hacked and nothing was reported....In Portugal people don't care about what<br>happens...They aren't aware that there are people building an underground system. <br>Ity's just that. On CNN, ZDNET, Wired etc.. they inform what's happening....<br>In Portugal the media just doesn't give a shit....<br>Maybe this is the best for us since this will prevent a media hype and PJ and other<br>FEDS won't be after us so soon..but information isn't circulating as it should.<br>People built a bad image of the &quot;hacker&quot;. Portuguese media report &quot;hackers&quot; as being<br>the ones who use trojans...<br>Man....they arten't aware of the true meaning of the concept &quot;hacker&quot; <br>They should think about it...<br><br></font><font face="Times New Roman" size=2><B>Why are we doing this?<br></B></font><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>We agree with some of the things that had been said by some groups. We are always hacking and for what? We hack and hack things whitch can be fixed in 2 minutes. In fact we could have done worse like destroying completely all servers. We can do it if we want but hackers are waiting for justice. If FBI doesn´t stop we won´t and we can start destroying. We think that FBI should explain what a fuck they are doing. For the moment we won´t destroy the servers we hack but if it is necessary we can burn alot of servers. For example this gov server could be erased completly.&nbsp; Everyone should think about this, about what´s happening.<br><br>Don't make all this a media hype just inform in a simple manner....people<br>need to know. People need to know why all this hacks. People need to know who FBI really is.<br></font>
