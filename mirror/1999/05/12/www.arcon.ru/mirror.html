I don't understand. All these hacking groups are popping up now.
All they do is fight. We are supposed to be on the same side.
Hackers fight to get our opinions heard, not to fight each other.
Let's get along! I am wondering where the Injun Hackers are too.
They claimed to be elite yet I haven't heard from them in a while
=\. I am still waiting for irc.psychic.com to be opened back up.
Everyone prank this person. He is an undercover fed. Tell him
that p0gO sent you: <br>
