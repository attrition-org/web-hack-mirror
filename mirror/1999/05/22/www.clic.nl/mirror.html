<b><u>0wned</u></b> - People went in, people went out. Some of the people 
gained root, while others had no idea what to do with their newly gained 
shellaccount. This server has been compromised so many times by so many 
different people over the last couple of days, that you'd expect the people 
administrating this server to have set up something more solid by now. This 
however seems not to be the case.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<!---
   And it's about bloody time they woke up.

<center><h2>This is your wake-up call.</h2></center>
Maybe it's about time that sysadmins learn to know about the weaknesses of the
servers they are administrating. Up until now there have only been people like
ourselves hacking into the server, but what if one of those many many people 
who gained access actually had malicious intent? All data on this server 
could've been wiped away in a split second - or worse, could've been used 
*against* one of the many sites hosted on this server.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In this hack no data has been compromised, read, filtered or modified and 
no files were tampered with. Mail accounts have not been accessed and no 
backdoors or filters have been installed on the server (although we easily 
could've done that as you might realize by now).<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A simple "mv index.old.html index.html" will bring your site back the way 
it was before we entered.<br>
