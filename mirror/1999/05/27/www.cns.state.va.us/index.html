<P>cause they don't got a clue about who hacked whitehouse.gov...</P>
<P>They are arresting gH members and are trying to get them narc, and do all the work for them. zyklon, a gH member who is indicted for crimes, is also being questioned.</P>
<P>the fbi can go to hell with their little contracts that they try to make with the people raided. they should know that no one is going to narc.</P>
<P>the raids have made gH and friends very mad. we think it's payback time now. </P>
