	Okay, we talked with f0bic in #./hack
	and we came to an agreement.
	gH and spl0it are basicly fighting for
	one.. 

	no more tangles between us.
	its all cool now.

	ANYWAYS.. this is my late-night anti JP hack.
	HEH!

	JP is still a dumbass gimp whore bag. Once 
	frauds like this lay off the crack,
	the net will be a better place.
