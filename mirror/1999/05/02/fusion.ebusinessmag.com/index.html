The bombing is ridiculous! The Ethnic Albanians and the Serbians have been
fighting in a civil war for hundreds of years. How would the US liked it, if
near the end of our civil war, Britian said, sorry, we support the
Confederates and started attacking Washington D.C.? Let them fight their own
war, and the losing side always makes things out worse then they are, in the
hope to get some sympathy.

Why did those kids kill the other kids? Did it ever dawn on anyone that
years of tormenting could of had some kind of impact? I am not saying that,
that was an excuse, but it sure played a huge part in their animosity toward
their school. Maybe if we all learned more TOLERANCE for people, that would
of never happened, and those 15 people would still be alive today.
