<p>
<b><font size=4>SUBMISSIONS TO SERVICE. </font></b>
</p>

<p>
Users are entitled to submit memoranda, newsletter articles, outlines and other substantive materials for inclusion in the
appropriate BellSouth library database. Users shall not submit any material that is defamatory, infringing, violative of applicable
law or otherwise detrimental to the system. 
</p>

<p>
While a user may preserve its copyright interest in submitted material, all materials submitted for public posting to the system
shall become part of a database, all compilation and collective copyrights in which are owned exclusively by BellSouth.
Moreover, users who submit material shall be deemed to (i) grant to BellSouth and subscribers to the system a paid up,
perpetual, world-wide irrevocable license to use, copy and redistribute such materials and any portions thereof and any
derivative works therefrom and (ii) warrant that such submitting user has all rights necessary to submit such material and that the
use of such material by BellSouth and subscribers to the system will not infringe any other party's rights. 
</p>

<p>
Each user agrees, as a condition of such license, (i) not to remove identifying source information from verbatim copies of
user-supplied materials (or substantially similar derivative works) found in public areas of the system and (ii) not to reproduce
portions thereof in any way that identifies the source but fails to describe accurately the nature and source of any modification,
alteration thereto or selection therefrom. 
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the licenses granted by users and information suppliers, users shall not engage in systematic, substantial and
regular replication of materials supplied to the system where the effect of such actions is to provide another person who is not
an authorized subscriber to such materials with a substantial substitute for a subscription. 
</p>

<p>
All users must abide by special terms and conditions associated with materials posted in the PRIVATE, NEWS, FYI and
RESOURCES areas or otherwise associated with information originating from commercial information providers. 
</p>

<p>
<b><font size=4>DELETIONS FROM SERVICE. </font></b>
</p>

<p>
BellSouth will delete any materials at the request of user who submitted the materials. BellSouth reserves the right to delete (or
to refuse to post to public forums) any materials it deems detrimental to the system or is, or in BellSouth's opinion may be,
defamatory, infringing or violative of applicable law. Although BellSouth reserves the right to exclude memoranda, it will not
knowingly edit materials submitted by users. Electronic mail stored on the system, whether or not it has been read by the
addressee, will be deleted after 90 days.

<b><font size=4>VIRUS PROTECTION</font></b>

Each party that submits materials agrees that in uploading executable files to the system it will use only computer systems

</p>

<p>
<b><font size=4>PRIVACY POLICY</font></b>
</p>

<p>
BellSouth is sensitive to privacy issues with respect to the use of customer information provided to us over the Internet.  We believe it is important for you to know how we treat the information about you that is received by us when you visit. In general, you can visit BellSouth on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself.  Our web servers collect domain names, and not the email addresses of our visitors.  This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, number of pages viewed, and methods by which our site was found. BellSouth uses this information to evaluate the use of our site and to continuously improve the content being provided. 
</p>

<p>
There are times however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address and other contact information.  This information is usually required to process requests initiated by 'visitors' to our site such as: on-line ordering, product & service information, developing profiles for receiving news alerts, and for sweepstakes entry.  When such information is needed, we will let you know how we will use the personal information at the time of collection.  While BellSouth may use this information to contact or send materials to you for marketing purposes, we will take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard the information from unauthorized access and, unless we specifically disclose it to you at the time of collection, we will not make customer-specific information that is gathered on our site available to unaffiliated organizations for commercial purposes unrelated to the business of BellSouth.
</p>

<p>
As a service to the news media and general site visitors, BellSouth provides an information notification service.  Visitors may voluntarily enter a  password protected, personalized 'contact profile' to receive late-breaking news and product specials via e-mail. Subscribers have control over their selected news selection and whether or not they want to suspend the service entirely, by re-visiting our site and amending their selections directly without having to email someone and wait for a reply.
</p>

<p>
BellSouth may make use of a technology called cookies, in order to provide you with tailored information.  A cookie is a tiny element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return.  You may set your browser to notify you or decline the receipt of a cookie.
At times we conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs and profile of our visitors.  When we conduct a survey, we will let you know how we will use the information at the time it is collected from you.
</p>

<p>
The BellSouth web site may contain links to other sites such as our sales affiliates and community service organizations.  While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.
</p>

<p>
Because of the evolving nature of the technologies that we use and the way that we conduct business, we may amend this policy from time to time.  We will post any revisions on this site.
