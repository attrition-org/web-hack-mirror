I just want to indicate that if you hack a server and change the html you should atleast have something to say atleast one to 2 subjects that will catch the eye, not this bullshit about oh your 0wned wow anyone can do that. Make up html thats funny like a goat fucking some girl in the ass or something, so it catches the eye and they want to keep reading. Okay to something eles, the whitehouse.gov hack from global hell, I like that you got access but the html needs alittle work on something big like that. Well nothing against you but thats what i think.<hr>Shout outs:NiTe , jennie , mindphasr , TrojaN_HorsE , Team Spl0it , mosthated.<br><br>As you can see this website has been compromised in no such way this was a "elite" hack i just wanted to get the point across.<br><br>Oh and shouts to everyone thats trying to make a diffrence on the internet and rl.<br>fuck you: Okay i only have 2 people i would like to say fuck you to, that is sublime and tal0n.
