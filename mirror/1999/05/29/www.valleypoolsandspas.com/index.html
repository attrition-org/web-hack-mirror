<p>Hi kids, do you like violence? How about getting nabbed by the
FBI? Hehe.. Hello all, it's me again, this one's on a more upbeat
note though. Recently, some of my friends and comrades got caught
by the FBI. I did not like this, and thought I'd do something
about it; then I got tired and just forgot.</p>

<hr width="80%">

<p>I oughta praise you like I should: This is to praise all the
hack groups who aren't dissing others, and to all the hackers who
are showing the government and alike who dominates. Yes, hear
this government, this is our world. We are your enemies, we are
your superiors, we are what you wake up in the morning to catch,
we are a dramatized version of you. We are an advanced version of
you. We are your creators, you could now be where you are without
us. Thank us, don't kill us. Thank us, and fear us.</p>

<hr width="80%">

<p>How corny was that? Well, there's an FBI agent reading this
right now, looking for speeling msitakes (hehe), trying to scrape
whatever they can off of who they have. It's a day that no one
thinks will ever come, and it comes to most everybody at one
point in their life. I await you guys, I'm here.</p>

<hr width="80%">

<p>Yeah, that's right... gH lives! The FBI thinks that they have
something on us. They don't, they never have, and never will. gH
is alive and happening. Remember The Mentor said, you may stop
this individual, but you can't stop us all? Hehe... Well, as you
know, he was right. It's funny, the FBI has nothing on anyone, so
it questions the same people over and over and over again,
thinking they will crack. Well, I'm asking you, as my friends,
comrades, and fellow hackers alike. Don't crack. Keep it all
underground, no matter how tempting the deal is, don't wreck the
spirit of the hacker. There you go Agent 34, you stopped my
friends, but you wont stop me. I'm right here. gH is right here.
We're all still here, just in a different world. Take us down by
the millions will you, we won't fall, we will prevail. We always
have, we always will. We are the one's who understand you; don't
fight us.</p>

<p align="center"><b>FBI Agents everywhere..</b><br>
<br>
HoHo, HaHa, HayHay,<br>
There coming to take me away.<br>
I am here, and here come they<br>
My antagonist and enemy, and now I pray<br>
That they wont come near me, as they did to my friend<br>
They question the same people, it's becoming a trend<br>
Sneeking through the bushes, predator approaches<br>
They bust down my door (infested with roaches)<br>
They scream out the words, I thought I'd never hear<br>
Bust a cap in their ass... yeah, now do you phear?<br>
</p>

<p align="center">My poetic skills are there.. hacking skills are
lacking, FBI dodging skills are not needed. What else do I need?
I'm all set. gH Baby! We're here to stay. Always forever.<br>
