<p align="left">也许与你从西方媒体获得的消息不同，我们将告诉你我们来这里的原因。<br>
五月八日的凌晨,当你们在梦中与天使交谈时.中国驻南斯拉夫大使馆荣幸地被尊贵的B--2轰炸机光临，有三名手无寸铁的中国记者无辜地领略了GBU--28穿透导弹的精确制导和惊人威力。在这一事件中，美国军方再一次获得了展示其武器精良的舞台，而中国有三位母亲同时失去了自己的孩子，有一位孩子失去了自己的母亲，而策划这一惨案的凶手却轻描淡写地归咎于一次失误，试图以自己的低能来欺骗中国人民的感情,将法律和道德置之不顾。而我们也因此来到这里，继续三位正直的记者未完成的公正而真实的报道。同时代表十三亿受到欺骗和伤害的中国人民来表达我们的愤怒。<br>

We are here to tell you the truthes, which might have been presented differently to you by 
your<br>
Government and mass media. On May 8, 1999, when most of you were still in your sweet 
dreams, talking peacefully with your angles, the Chinese Embassy at Bulgrade, the 
Yugoslavia captial, was outrageously attacked by at least 3 precision guided missles of 
NATO from one B-2 bomber. Three innocent, harmless chinese journalists were killed and 
more than 20 chinese were injured. Once again, the &quot;mighty&quot; America and NATO 
impressively showed up their excellent killing<br>
technologies to the whole world. Three chinese mothers lost their beloved children, one 
child<br>
lost his mother. But the America leaded NATO who planned and did this insane murder, 
dcalred it<br>
was an accident shamelessly. This can only shows the world how foolish and arrogant these 
murders really are, how disrespectful they really are to the real human rights, ethics, 
and<br>
international laws. Therefore, in order to let people all over the world know the truth 
and <br>
remember the crime, we came here to finsish the unfinished, real, unbiasd work of the 
three dead repoters. We come here to represent 13 billion chinese people to express our 
outmost indignation and solemn protest to the USA leaded NATO <br>
<br>

毫无疑问以美国为首的北约是故意轰炸中国大使馆，这里有着极其龌龊的，阴险的，令人作呕的阴谋。<br>

The brutal attack of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade has generated wide spread angry 
feelings<br>
among not only the Chinese people, but also all peace-loving people of different nations 
in the<br>
world. We would like to express our deep regret and condolence to the people of China over 
the<br>
dead and the wounded incurred in this tragic incident and demand:<br>
<br>
<strong><font color="#FF0000">1. Stop the bombing immediately!<br>
2. An open and official Apoloy (not &quot;regret&quot;) to China and the victims 
relatives!<br>
3. A thorough investigation of whole accident!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prompt disclosure of the results of the investigation!<br>
4. To punish severely those reponsible for the attack!<br>
