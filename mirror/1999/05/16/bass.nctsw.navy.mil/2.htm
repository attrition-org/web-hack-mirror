Excerpts from online articles<br>
<br>
人真的生而平等吗？三个被俘的美国大兵，在美国传媒中的地位肯定高于四个已经长眠的中国人。美国电视可以一遍又一遍地播放三个美国佬对家人讲话的录象，却从来不屑于提及三位中国人的名字，仿佛怕鲜血玷污了他们高贵的嘴巴。或者美国人真的就高贵一些吧，移民到美国就意味着自身的升值。三个大兵至少有机会向家里人道下平安，而中国人就即使无辜死亡也只是换了几句没有任何附加值的歉意。对不起，我打错人了，我向你表示歉意，但应该承认你们的脸长得也不是地方。中国人的脸真是犯贱，贱到耽误了高贵的美国打其他地方。克林顿，你这次又错了。应该道歉的是中国人，耽误了你们的宝贵的电子游戏时间，真是万分的对不起，我们下次再也不敢了。<br>

Are people really equal? Thanks to the American media, the three captured American solders 
must be much more respected than the 3 Chinese who died in the war. The American media 
plays footage of these 3 American soliders speaking to their family over and over, but 
they never bother to mention the names of the 3 Chinese, as if the blood of these Chinese 
would pollute their noble mouths. The three American soldiers could at least speak to 
their families, but the Chinese's deaths worth only a few meaningless apologies. &quot;Oh 
I'm sorry, we killed the wrong guy. We apologize. But it's your fault to be there.&quot; 
It's us Chinese who should apologize. We are the bad guys, again. </p>

总是想着这样一个事实，究竟谁是罪犯，谁是受害者。话说有个权势很大的人杀了人，因为他权势大，所以没人敢惹他，自然告状也告不赢。受害者的家属只有忍声吞气，整人以泪洗面，痛哭失声。但是，这下又犯错了。因为权势者老是听见哭声，再加上心里有鬼，闹到晚上失眠。几天下来，权势者大发雷霆，最后将受害者家属告到法院。理由是他们的哭声给权势者造成了精神伤害，自己理所应当获得赔偿。所以，有时候悲伤并不是一种基本权利，这要视悲伤的矛头而定。据说我们的悲伤也已经引起了美大人的不满了，他们反复播放了被悼念的声音惊到一团的使馆人员，果然是楚楚可怜状。按照美国正常的逻辑接着就要开始起诉了。你可以悲伤，但决不能让我听到，否则就是侵犯了我的人权，请注意，这是天赋人权，是神圣不可侵犯了。真地想问问这个可爱的天，为什么就可以赋给美国这么多美丽的人权，为什么不分一点给那三俱中国僵尸？中国果真是太阳照不到的地方吗？<br>
<br>
I always wonder who is the criminal and who the victim. Say for example, a man with a lot 
of power killed someone. But because he has a lot of power, the victims family could not 
win on the court but only cry every day. But they are the bad guys, because the powerful 
man often hears the crying, plus he's afraid of the ghost of the dead, it really bothers 
him, so he cannot sleep well at night. So he sued the family of the dead man because what 
they did bothered him. Therefore, sometimes being sad is not a natural right. It depends 
on who you're against. I heard that our sadness has made Americans very unhappy. The media 
kept playing the sound of the people in the US embassy, who were bothered by our mourning. 
They ARE so poor. So in the American logic, they should be suing us now. Yes, you may 
mourn, but you're not supposed to let me hear it. If you did, you've violated my human 
right. And hey, that's the right God gave us, the most holy, unviolatable right. I can't 
help wondering why the Americans always have so many rights, why not share a little with 
the 3 Chinese corpses. </p>

同样的示威游行，八九年就是自发的正义游行，九九年就变成是中国政府所指示的阴谋。在你们的电视屏幕中，游行的人个个都拍到面目可憎，十足的暴徒形象。有一点事实可以告诉你们，十年后的学生，就整体水平而言，肯定比十年前的学生漂亮许多。吾尔凯西那叫作脸？他只是完美解释了生物学上的一个名词-灾变。你们可以指责中国政府利用群众，向你们施加压力，但我们自己有另外一个解释，叫做民心可用。如果我们的愤怒被政府所利用向你们增加了一分一毫的压力，我们都感到无比地快慰，一种被人利用的快慰。暴徒这个名词由中国政府口里转移到了你们的口中，看来暴徒是有时间性的，更是有针对性的。比八九年温和地多的行动，只是因为针对你们于是就变成了暴行。自然，你们的轰炸还不算暴行，有个十分暧昧的名称，技术性失误。或者用错了地图的失误，或者是近视眼看错了地方的失误，更或者是我们的失误，是我们把大使馆建错了地方的失误。对于我们的暴行，我们表示歉意，对于我们建错了使馆的失误，我们表示更强烈的歉意。<br>
<br>
<br>
Similar two protests--- the one in 1989 was a voluntary and rightful protest, but the one 
in 1999 now is a conspiracy under the secret command of the Chinese government. In 
American TV, the protestors are all scary rioters. But I can tell you something: The 
students after these 10 years, are better than the students 10 years before on average. 
You can condemn that the Chinese goverment is using their people to put political pressure 
on you. But, if our rage, used by the government, has really put any pressure on you, I 
will feel enormously rejoiced. Our protest today is much milder than the 1989 one, but 
since it's against you, it's called riot. Of course, your bombing does not qualify to be 
called riot. You have a good name for it: a tragical mistake, or a mistake by outdated 
map, or a mistake by some near-sighted guy who looked into the wrong place, or let's just 
say it's our Chinese's mistake. It's our mistake to build the embassy at the wrong place. 
We strongly strongly apologize for our mistake, and for our protests.<br>
<br>
<br>
现在让我相信西方传媒的公正性，不如让我相信莱温斯基是个处女。也许莱温斯基会对这种类比表示不满，毕竟她曾经是个处女，但西方传媒是否曾经公正过都是一个疑问。莱温斯基正在想方设法给自己立个牌坊，立一个类似戴安娜那样一个纯情牌坊，我们赞赏她的努力，即使不会成功也罢。我们更佩服西方传媒立贞洁牌坊的本领，赖温斯基的牌坊上写着“即将纯情”，而西方传媒的牌坊上也有四个大字“已经公正”。抽雪茄去吧，自由公正的西方传媒们。面对两个中国同行的无辜死亡，你们的公正去到了哪里？你们看到了脏<br>
裙子，你们看到了赤色中国的威胁，你们却看不到被炸翻的公共汽车，你们更加看不到中国亲人的眼泪。闪闪发光的公正性里隐约散发着一种腥臊味，一股血腥味，但你们依旧说它香气扑鼻。我感冒，最多只能分辨到过期的古龙水味道。<br>
<br>
<br>
If you want me to trust the justice of the Western media, rather let me believe Monica 
Lewinsky is still a virgin. Maybe Lewinsky wouldn't be too hapy with this analogy, but 
it's questionable<br>
whether the Western media have ever had any justice. I respect her effort to make herself 
look<br>
like a virgin, but I respect more the ability of the Western media to make anyone look 
like a<br>
virgin. Just go smoke your cigars, so-called free and fair Wester media. At the deaths of 
3<br>
Chinese people, where is your justice? What you see is dirty dresses, and the threat from 
the<br>
rising Red China. You cannot see the bombed bus full of people, nor the tears of the 
Chinese<br>
families. I can smell blood from the shining justice. And you claim it smells good. or 
maybe<br>
there's something wrong with my nose.</p>

中国已经有了许多历史的伤痕，但肇事者却往往不承认。一个日本人，一个德国人正在为南京大屠杀作证。因为他们是较高贵的人种，所以他们的日记比三十万冤魂的呐喊更加被世界所重视。我们无须介意那个日本兵的官司是否获胜，也更不必为德国人的正义感而特别的感动，有没有他们作证都抹杀不了屠杀的事实，那一个个万坑就已经说明了一切。难道我们这次也必须拉一个美国人作证才感到理直气壮？我们的使馆原先在那里，现在已经变成了另外一个模样，这已经足够了。我们自己挺起腰，自己就可以给自己怍证，日本人<br>
以前对中国人犯下了罪行，美国人现在又对中国人犯下了罪行。 <br>
<br>
China has a lot of scars in its history, but the criminals rarely had the courage to 
admit. A<br>
Japanese and a German can testify in a lawsuit against what the Japanese did in NanKing 
Massacre, just because they're &quot;better&quot; races, so their diaries even worths more 
than the actual more than 300,000 dead bodies. We don't need to worry if the Japanese 
soldier won the suit, nor do we need to be moved by the German's sense of justice. With or 
without them, the massacre of more than 300,000 Chinese people in NanKin is a non-erasable 
fact. Those buried dead bodies already said it all. Do we even need an American to testify 
for us? Our embassy stood there, and now it has another look. Isn't that just enough to 
say everything? We are proud of ourselves, and we can testify for ourselves. The Japanese 
did something wrong to us, and now it's the Americans.<br>
<br>
美国人用了七个人去拯救一个大兵，只是因为美国军方心里觉得对不起那位士兵的母亲。美国人狡辩到这次轰炸是一次失误，因为他们根本没有感觉到中国母亲的存在。美国的导弹对中国进行了第一次轰炸，美国人的无耻言行对中国人的心灵进行了第二次的轰炸。<br>
<br>
<br>
US Army sent 7 soldiers to save one private Ryan, only because the Army's top felt sorry 
for<br>
Ryan's mother. Americans claim this bombing is a mistake, because they never felt the 
existence of Chinese mothers. Their missles was the first wave bombing on us, and their 
shameless words bombed our Chinese hearts afterwards.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>向你们澄清几个事实：<br>
<br>
Let's make a few things clear:<br>
<br>
北约是故意袭击中国大使馆，而西方媒体却一直是别有用心的传递着一个信息：“误炸”。进而还学猪八戒――倒打一耙，说中国袭击美国大使馆。<br>
<br>
NATO bombed the Chinese embassy on purpose, but the Western media kept sending oen message 
to the people: &quot;Mistakenly bombed&quot;. And they are even trying to turn the fact 
upside-down, saying that we Chinese are attacking U.S. embassies.<br>
<br>
我们抗议是自发的，而西方媒体却舔不知耻地说是政府策划的。我觉得很恶心，要吐。他们的一个证据就是说学生是做大客车来的。实际上，做大客车来的是少数。而且，他们把“大客车”作为证据，似乎是说在中国，只有政府才有大客车？这简直――我已经吐得不行了。实际上，政府不但没有所谓“组织”游行，反而还是――从某种意义上说――有些限制。要不然，美国大使馆可能就不仅仅是窗子破了。政府实际上是保护了美国的安全。<br>
<br>
Our protests are absolutely voluntary, but the shameless Western media keep saying that 
the<br>
protests are planned and encouraged by the government. They make me so disgusted. Their 
only<br>
evidence is that the students went to the embassies by buses. As a matter of fact, only a 
small<br>
percentage of the students took bus to the embassies. Besides, are they saying that only 
the<br>
Chinese government can own buses? That is so---- I cannot stand it. Actually, the 
government not only never &quot;organized&quot; any protest, but also, in a way, 
restrained the protest. Or else what the U.S. embassies had now would not be just broken 
windows. The government, in fact, secured U.S. embassies.<br>
<br>
来中国旅游是否安全？你们问一下现在正在中国旅游的人就知道。之所以有人散布谣言说不安全，是因为他们敌视中国，尽一切可能的破坏中国的形象。<br>
<br>
Is it safe to travel to China now? Don't take my words. Simply ask people who are taking a 
tour in China right now. The reason somebody broadcasted the rumors that it's unsafe to 
travel in China is because they hate China and want to destroy the positive image of China 
in every possible way.<br>
