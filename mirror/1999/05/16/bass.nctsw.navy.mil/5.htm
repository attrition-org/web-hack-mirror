<p align="left">们来自中国，我们不是恶意地入侵，也不是恶作剧，我们只是来告诉你们，在你们身边正在发生什么？并且提醒你们，应该为世界和平做些什么？<br>
<br>
<br>
We are from China. We do not have a bad intention, nor are we just having fun. We are here 
to<br>
inform you what's going on around you, and to remind you what you should contribute to our<br>
world's peace. <br>
<br>
我们是中国黑客紧急会议中心，我们对这起事件负责。首先，我们本不是黑客，但以美国为首的北约对我驻南使馆的野蛮暴行，对我中华民族的肆意侵略，加上外国媒体对我们的抗议活动的肆意诬蔑，使我们不得不拿起武器，其次，我们并不关心政治，但为了世界和平，我们不得不发出我们的声音。<br>
<br>
We're the Chinese Hackers' emergency center. We are responsible for this incident. First 
of all, we used not to be hackers, but due to the rude attacks to our Chinese nation by 
the NATO under the leadership of the U.S., and due to the biased reports on our voluntary 
protests in the Western media, we have to defend ourselves and fight back. Secondly, we 
don't care about politics. But for the sake of World's Peace, we have no choice but speak 
out our mind.<br>
<br>
声明：本组织是一个临时组织，成员来自中国各地。我们成立的原因是――北约的无理野蛮的挑衅，我们成立的目的――抗议，打破外国敌对新闻机构的新闻封锁，让世人都能看清楚美国和北约的霸权心态和禽兽行为。我们没有严密的分工和行动规则，我们甚至互不认识，但我们团结一心。我们坚决拥护中国政府和中国共产党的主张。请公安部门放心。我们不会删除或破坏他人站点的任何数据。只要中国人民和中国政府的最终目的全面地无条件地一达到，我们自然解散。但是，现在，我们在行动！<br>
<br>
We declare that this organization is a temporary one, founded by members from all of 
China. The<br>
reason we found this organization is--- to protest, to break through the news blockade to 
the<br>
truth by the Western news media, and to make it possible for everyone to see clearly the 
real<br>
image of the intention and rude actions of the US-NATO. We do not have a well-planned<br>
who-does-what, or any specific rules. Even, we do not know each other. But we're formed 
together, with one uniform goal. We strongly support our Chinese government and the 
Chinese Communist Party's decisions. We will not delete or destroy any website's data. As 
soon as the Chinese people and government's goal is finally unconditionally reached, our 
group will disband by default. But now, we are on action!<br>

这一段话是说给美国黑客听的：我们不是想炫耀点什么，我们也无意跟你们对抗。但我们听到了你们要“报仇”的消息，我们感到非常遗憾，我们确实不想与你们发生冲突。我想，我们国家的网络安全系统平均起来比你们国家的要差的多，希望你们不要以此来展示你们的能力。但是，我们并不惧怕任何威胁。总之，希望你们能理解。<br>
<br>
This paragraph is to the American hackers. We do not want to show off anything, nor do we 
have the intention to start an online war with you. When we heard the news that you were 
going to<br>
&quot;revenge&quot;, we felt very sorry because we did not intend to have any conflict 
with you. In my<br>
opinion, the security system in our country's networks are worst than the ones in your 
country on the average, which will be an advantage to you. However, we are not afraid of 
any threat. Anyway, I hope you can understand us.<br>
<br>

这一段话是说给CIA和FBI听的：我听说你们正在调查我们，其实，我们跟普通老百姓无异，我想，要是你们愿意，你们可以调查所有中国人的行动，如果你们没有新地图，我可以给你一份，不贵，才两块钱。别老盯着我们，本组织组成结构极不严密，我们互相根本不认识，而且，大部份是提供后勤的普通网民，只有少数几个人掌握攻击技术，而这几个人有几个，分别是谁，我们根本不知道。而且，你们调查了也没用，你们国家过去不给我们引渡罪犯，现在，我们照样不给你们引渡。<br>
<br>
This is the paragraph for CIA and FBI: I heard that you are investigating us. Actually, 
we're<br>
just average people. You can investigate all the Chinese's actions if you like. If you 
still don't have the new map, I can give you one for just two dollars. Don't put your 
energy on us. Our organization is not complex at all. Even, we do not know each other. 
Besides, most members are just average web users doing some simple jobs (Such as me, the 
translator :o). Only a few of us knows the hacking technics, and I have no idea how many 
there are, or who they are. In addition, your investigation will only turn out to be a 
fruitless effort. In the past, your government refused to return Chinese criminals to us. 
Now it will be our government's turn to refuse.<br>
<br>

最后一段话是说给中国公安和国家安全人员听的：警察叔叔，您好，你们已经注意到了我们。但说实话，我们太善良了，完完全全是守法的市民，我们认真学习了中国的有关法律法规，但没有发现我们犯了哪一条。而且，我们也不是“非法集会”，因为我们根本没有见过面，我们每个人都不清楚本“中心”的详细情况，更别谈“坦白从宽”了。总之，找到我们，我们也是一问三不知，是确确实实真的不知道。对不起。我们承诺，只进行教育，不会破坏删除数据。我们还立志帮助我国的网络系统提高安全水平。总之，我们坚决拥护中国政府的一切主张，坚决拥护中国公产党的领导，遵纪守法，忠心报国，时刻听从党的召唤！<br>
<br>
Again, we strongly support any policy, decision, or action by our government and our 
police. We<br>
were not encouraged by the government, nor anyone. We are doing this solely on our own 
free will. The purpose of news media is to fool the average people like you and us. But 
sometimes the American people are just too ignorant to question the credibility of your 
country's media. Too often what you get is the negative image of today's China. And now 
they're making you think<br>
bombing the Chinese embassy is just a little &quot;tragic mistake&quot; and that we're 
making a fuss of this with all the protests. Please, think again! What would Americans do 
if your overseas embassy is bombed?<br>
