BEAT THIS SHIT <a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/edu/cim.ucdavis.edu/">FORPAXE</a>@#%!
 itz quality, not quantity BITCHES. Now im not going to go off on some "hacktivism" shit 
because i honestly didnt own this page with ethics in mind. Sorry guys, but this one 
is just to tell forpaxe to SHUT THE HELL UP and leave us alone. We *never* did shit to 
you or said anything negative, but <a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/edu/cim.ucdavis.edu/">look</a>.. 
out of nowhere you call us lame for owning something you could never DREAM of touching (yes you 
know exactly what im talking about). I really hate to say this, but JP > forpaxe. OUCH.
