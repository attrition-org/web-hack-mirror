Guide To Disruptive Revolutionary Tactics for High-Schoolers!!</em></font></h2>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>1.</b> Get a syringe
    (minus needle) or similar device. Mix both tubes of epoxy
    glue with a little rubbing alcohol. You now have about half
    an hour to fill locks, door jambs, etc. before glue hardens.
    If you can't get the epoxy glue and syringe a tube of
    airplane cement can also be used although it is not as
    permanent. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>2.</b> An
    alternative use for the syringe is to pretend to shoot up
    while a teacher is watching. If they speak to you tell them
    you have to do it because school is so horrible.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>3.</b> Call the
    school and leave the phone off the hook. The way some (but
    not all) phone systems work this will tie up their phone for
    as long as yours is off the hook.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>4.</b> Protest U.S.
    aid to reactionary regimes abroad by defoliating plants
    around the school or by digging a bomb crater on the front
    lawn. When the ecology freaks complain ask them where they
    were when the U.S. was doing the same thing to Indochina.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>5.</b> Draw or paste
    something 'obscene' on pull-down wall maps or movie screens.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>6.</b> Get some of
    the punch cards that your school uses for taking attendance.
    Punch new holes in them either with a keypunch machine or a
    screwdriver. Then switch the cards with others wherever they
    are stored. If you can figure out the code the cards are
    punched by this has even more possibilities. You can often be
    just as effective without actually repunching the cards by
    redistributing them a few days after you collect them
    (particularly when they're used for attendence).</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>7.</b> Start an
    information service to get new students opinions and warnings
    about the teachers and administrators before enrollment day.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>8.</b> Bad food?
    Have a good old fashioned food riot.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>9. </b>In gym
    classes or in hallways between classes have massive searches
    for 'lost' contact lenses telling people not to walk through
    the hall or 'you might step on it'.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>10.</b> If your
    school still has a dress code protest it having everyone do
    something disruptive that does not violate the code. For
    example, dye your hair green with food coloring.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>11.</b> Free all the
    animals in the biology classroom.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>12.</b> Write a
    'consumer report' on the 'education' you've been consuming.
    Distribute it to parents at school functions.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>13.</b> Periodically
    have students go to the office to have some rumor confirmed
    or denied.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>14.</b> Perform
    citizen's arrests of administrators for destroying the minds
    of youth then telephone the police to come and take the
    criminals into custody. (This would be an excellent guerilla
    theatre action).</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>15.</b> Rip off
    dishes and silverware from the cafeteria, towels from the
    gym, stencils and paper from the duplicating room, layout
    equipment from the art and drafting departments, tools from
    the wood shop, and light bulbs from the sockets. Give them to
    a needy movement group.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>16.</b> During lunch
    turn on and light all the gas jets in the science labs.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>17.</b> Change the
    teachers suger at the staff room with coocane :) the teachers
    might start playing some games with you.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>18.</b> You can make
    a very effective fuse by inserting a non-filter cigarette in
    a book of matches so that it touches the head of some matches
    and will ignite them when it burns down that far. Then loosly
    crumple paper around the matches and cigarettes so that they
    are hidden. Toss it in a wastebasket or any other area with a
    lot of papers preferrably in the office. It takes about 5
    minutes to ignite -- by then you can be on the other side of
    the building. Practice this at home before trying it.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>19.</b> Have giant
    coughing or sneezing epidemics in class or study hall. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>20.</b> Rub
    lipstick, glue, vaseline, or shit onto the doorknobs of the
    school's administrative offices.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>21.</b> Swallow some
    snake bite antidote then walk into the principal's office.
    The antidote (most types are harmless -- make sure you get
    that kind) will make you vomit. Do so all over his carpet,
    desk, clothing, etc. then apologize profusely.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>22.</b> Pick up some
    dog training liquid at any pet store -- it smells like
    concentrated piss. And if you can't figure out what to do
    with that then you shouldn't be reading this.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>23.</b> Remove
    contents of teacher's mailboxes. Print up everything that's
    confidential or interesting.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>24.</b> Leave notes
    and hints that 'Tuesday's the day'.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>25.</b> Impersonate
    parental voices and make irate phone calls to the office.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>26.</b> Make a super
    stink bomb out of Hydrogen Sulfide and put somewhere in the
    ventilating system. This has cleared school buildings for
    days.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>27.</b> If your
    school has a suspended ceiling (a ceiling composed of
    rectangles or squares resting on a frame so that the
    rectangles can be pushed up) you can put a dead fish -- or
    anything else -- above them. Or put it into empty lockers and
    glue them shut.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>28.</b> Put signs on
    your locker saying 'this locker will self-destruct if opened
    for inspection'.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>29.</b> Give your
    school library a subscription to a good underground newspaper
    from your area and insist that they make it available to
    students.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>30.</b> Print up
    false notices frequently using the same format as the school
    uses and distribute them to the teachers' mailboxes.
    Eventually they'll never know what to believe.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>31.</b> Make your
    own passes, forms, tickets, etc. or lift them out of
    teachers' desks.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>32.</b> Need a
    signature? Collect things that have teachers' signatures on
    them. Paste them all down on a sheet of white paper and
    either xerox or print up a bunch of copies. Forge when
    useful. (When getting started you might put a piece of carbon
    paper under the signature with the carbon paper facing down
    on what you want signed. Then trace over the name with a
    steady relaxed hand. Practice makes perfect.)</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>33.</b> Do some
    revolutionary wall painting. All you need is a can of spray
    paint (red?) plus a little imagination and courage. Then
    write your favorite slogans on walls, sidewalks, blackboards,
    etc. If you are a perfectionist you can make a stencil, but
    that limits the size of what you can do. WEAR GLOVES or you
    will certainly get tell-tale paint on your spraying finger.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>34.</b> Are certain
    teachers or administrators misbehaving? Print up a rat sheet
    with their names and telephone numbers and distribute it. Now
    students can call up at any time and reprimand them -- 3:00
    AM for example. Also you could order them pizzas ... plumbers
    ... think big!</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>35.</b> Break into
    your school at night and burn it down. To get inside you can
    either hide in the building during the day and wait until the
    janitor leaves (know in advance what time that is), or come
    in later at night and either force your way through the door,
    find an open window, or break a window (see Monroe Mindfuck).
    If you use the latter method do it a few hours or days in
    advance so you don't get caught if it attracts attention. Be
    careful not to leave fingerprints -- wear gloves all the time
    if possible. Once inside make sure the walls will light well
    by placing loose paper or wood around them, or squirting
    lighter fluid, kerosene, or gasoline onto them. If a lot of
    burnable boxes are stacked in one area spread them around.
    Start the fire from the inside of the building so it will
    take longer before it can be seen from the windows. Make sure
    the fire has a way to travel from one burnable area to
    another. Of course you should wear dark clothes and know
    exactly where you are going when you split.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>36.</b> Get hold of
    a film to be shown at a school assembly and splice in parts
    of another movie of your own choosing before the assembly. A
    little imagination on your part will make for an
    unforgettable day.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>37.</b> Clog up the
    drains of sinks with clay then turn on the water after
    everyone leaves school.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>38.</b> Teachers
    often leave gradebooks, conduct sheets, and attendance
    records unguarded. Take every chance to help yourself.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>39</b>. Put up
    posters all around the school. To make them stick permanently
    use Pet evaporated milk for glue.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>40.</b> You could
    ice-pick tires as a warning -- but make sure you have a total
    enemy before you put sugar in their gas tank.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>41.</b> Start
    wailing in the halls.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>42.</b> If you can't
    find any skunks, let chickens loose in the school ... or
    pigeons.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>43.</b> Create the
    'WEB OF THREAD' in your classroom. Have everybody in your
    class bring a spool of thread -- with extras for people who
    forget. Tie your thread onto something and pass the spools
    around till you run out, winding thread around everything.
    (It is best to pick on one of your more dullwitted teachers
    for this one). Expalin that you did it in the name of art.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>44.</b> Carry and
    pretend to sell oregano rolled in papers and aspirin with the
    name filed off.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>45.</b> Put Calcium
    Carbide (available in some parts of the country as 'Gopher-
    Go', also available in some hobby and joke shops) in a
    gelatin capsule and flush down a toilet or sink. Calcium
    Carbide reacts violently with water, quickly producing large
    amounts of HIGHLY FLAMMABLE gas and bursting pipes, etc. as
    soon as the water dissolves the capsule.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>46.</b> Ride a
    bicycle down a busy hall.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>47.</b> Save your
    book reports and essays. Give them to other students to use
    next year or re-use them yourself with different teachers.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>48.</b> Play with
    lighting and microphone controls during 'important'
    assemblies.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>49.</b> Flush things
    down the toilets (preferably faculty johns) like balloons
    filled with air, baseballs, M80's, huge amounts of toilet
    paper, etc. Then build an ark.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>50.</b> Start a
    campaign to have the letter Z appear everywhere as the mark
    of angry students.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>51.</b> You can
    short-circuit the school's wiring by taking a regular plug
    with a short cord attached. Connect the 2 wires with a switch
    between them. Plug it in, turn the switch on, and you've
    blown a fuse. Turn it off, pull it out, and try another. You
    don't have to use the switch, but if you don't sometimes the
    current will arc and weld the plug to the socket.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>52.</b> Set up a
    fake school and hire away the lousy teachers -- or put up
    notices inviting the entire school to a going away party for
    a teacher who isn't really leaving.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>53.</b> Read the
    school budget. Reprint and distribute a list of the stupid
    expenditures.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>54.</b> Take booze
    to lunch in a thermos and pass it around.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>55.</b> During some
    important test (SAT/ACT/etc. ) on each subject have some
    student who is good at that subject stand up and read the
    correct answers for as long as possible. When they're
    finished or silenced have someone else stand up and do the
    same thing. The test results will be worthless and it will
    have to be given over at great cost to the school.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>56.</b> Take down
    the American flag in front of the school and put up one of
    your own. The best way to do this is to lower the flag that's
    already up replace it with your flag and cut the rope about a
    foot below where the flag is attached. Then tie a slip knot
    around the other end of the rope that is hanging down to
    raise the flag. At this point there is no way your flag can
    be lowered without someone climbing up the flagpole.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>57.</b> Put alarm
    clocks in various lockers set on 'loudest'. Set the alarm
    clocks so they will go off about every 10 minutes then close
    and lock the lockers.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>58.</b> Have a group
    of people march around the school with a flag singing the
    Star Spangled Banner. If the administration tries to punish
    you telephone your local radio stations and patriotic groups
    and complain that your school is being run by pinkos.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>59.</b> In a class
    where there is a rule against chewing gum have everyone blow
    a bubble at the same time one day.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>60.</b> Many schools
    have automatic sprinkler systems which go off automatically
    when sensors in the ceiling feel too much heat. Find the
    sensors and hold up a match to them.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>61.</b> Persuade the
    graduating class to use their senior gift money for something
    useful or subversive.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>62.</b> Reprint
    School Stoppers Textbook in your underground paper or on a
    leaflet or buy bulk copies and pass them around.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>63.</b> Demand that
    all equipment being stored rather than being used be made
    available to students.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>64.</b> If your
    school won't have a teacher evaluation make up some forms and
    do it yourself. Compile the result and publicize them to
    students, faculty, school board, and community.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>65.</b> Use your
    'free choice' book reports, term papers, etc. to read
    revolutionary literature and further the political education
    of you and your class.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>66.</b> Have a
    student lie on the ground. When a teacher comes scream 'he
    jumped' and point to the roof or third floor window. Mumble
    'Fred dared him' or 'Maybe it was LSD.'</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>67.</b> Make an
    address list of disliked adults in your school. Answer sex
    ads for them -- or order them a few gross items (C.O.D. of
    course).</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>68.</b> Toss
    handfuls of BB's on the floors of busy halls, assemblies,
    graduation ceremonies, weddings, funerals.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>69.</b> Steal
    cafeteria trays or plates, burn large holes in them, and turn
    them into the school washer saying 'I guess the food did it'.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>70.</b> Leave phony
    letters of resignation from teachers or administrators on the
    principal's desk.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>71.</b> Get a small
    group to always carry screwdrivers and slowly dismantle the
    school.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>72.</b> Lots of bomb
    scares tend to break up the boredom especially during exams
    or on beautiful days.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>73.</b> Photograph
    teachers and administrators constantly -- even without film.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>74.</b> If you've
    got the nerve piss in your pants while giving an oral report.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>75.</b> Splice into
    your school's intercom system (from a remote hidden spot).
    Now you have your own guerilla radio station. Play on!</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>76.</b> Drop large
    bottles of ether in science class.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>77.</b> Hang your
    teacher! Hang a hangman's noose from a tree - make a dummy
    and hang the dummy from the noose. Pin notes on it like
    'Weatherbee in '73.' To add realism put holes in the body
    then let dilute ketchup trickle down.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>78.</b> Newspaper
    stands in buildings are usually left unguarded. Take out
    papers and replace with rotten comics or papers.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>79.</b> Put a rotten
    apple or stale sandwich on teacher's desk.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>80.</b> If your
    school intercom has phones that connect into the intercom
    switchboard, put a small magnet either where the cord comes
    out of the handset or in the part where you hear. If the
    intercom just has a speaker, put the magnet near or on one of
    the electrical connections of the speaker. In either case it
    will short out the system. It may take weeks for them to find
    the trouble.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>81.</b> Take the
    door of the administration offices off its hinges but leave
    it standing there so that when the principal tries to open
    the door in the morning it will have a slightly crushing
    effect.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>82.</b> Can't figure
    out what to do with that blinking light that came with your
    one Pink Floyd album. Sneak into the girl's locker room and
    hid it behind an air vent in the wall. Then when one of the
    girls notices the blinking light, they'll think theyr being
    taped! }:¬]&gt; class dismissed!</font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>83.</b> During a
    school walking trip you will notice that there are sign posts
    telling you where to walk, so simply change the direction of
    the sign ripping the tag off the wall - watch everyone go in
    the wrong direction (works really well on a long nature walk)
    - you'll probably get back to school at 3am.. If your the
    last person that got the right direction, you will be ACCUSED
    of doing it, so act smart by taking a map with you! </font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>84. </b>Find out a
    teachers phone number and stick it up in all the phones boxes
    in a sex district saying &quot;naugty but nice&quot; ..print
    them out with the number and watch the teacher lose his/her
    temper! :) LOL! </font></p>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><b>85. </b>Break one of
    the legs on the teachers chair during a time when there is
    nobody there - keeping the chair upright - then when the
    teacher will sit on it, you should be prepared to call the
    ambulance from africa.</font></p>
