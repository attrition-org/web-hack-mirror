Devil-C are right, we must stop this senseless group bashing.
There is no need. Every group is trying to out-do another, what
for? So they can get more of the spot-light? What spot-light? Are
we on the news for hacking/defacing pages? Are we in newspapers?
Are we on the radio? The answer is NO. These hacks are only seen
by us, the hackers, and pretty much no one else (unless it is a
major/controversial attack). So why do we bash each other? I dont
know, i dont think the bashers do either, they just do it out of
pure stupidity/to show off.</em></font></p>

'Defiance' is a new &quot;gr3wp&quot;, that shows that they are
pretty much nobody's and should be quiet about bashing other
