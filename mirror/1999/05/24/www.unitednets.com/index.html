Doobie doobie doo. Well, the end of the schoolyear for most kiddies is here. Ah yes, summer... time to drink, smoke weed, and
get laid. (not in that order necesarily) All I have to tell you new teenagers is be careful... don't do anything stupid...
like not smoke. SMOKE POT AND BE HAPPY! Screw the government. Just watch out for cop cars when toking in the backseat of your
car. Never smoked? No problem, just ask anybody at your local highschool about it... 4/5 kids smoke pot. (fuck those
commercials that say otherwise) Do as the Slack says and grab a bong, you know I will!<p>
