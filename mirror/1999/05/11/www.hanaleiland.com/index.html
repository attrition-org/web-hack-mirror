<p align="center">Not much to say, but I thought I'd say it,
before it got out of hand. These things can explode, and nobody
will know it for a while. A lot of people have been saying
personal thoughts about others, so I thought I would too. This
has nothing to do with how elite people are, and I'm trying not
to direspect anyone every group here, I have respect for, you'll
understand more as you read.</p>

This is out the the INDIANhackers, supposedly, you were here to
stay, and you hacked a lot of pages for a while, when wu-ftp was
still popular, however, now that there are not many boxes that
have wu-ftp, it seems you've died away? Who are/were the
INDIANhackers, and why have you just died away? This is what I
want to know. If you are still there, present yourselves, with
out a wu-ftp exploit. I have nothing against you, I'm just
wondering where you have gone?</p>

<p align="center"><br>
I am also getting tired of people using the same html on a whole
bunch of pages, for one, if you're gonna hack a site, please do
so with a reason, not to just own the site. That's getting lame.
IT might have been cool when there weren't so many script kiddies
around, it's just now, everyone wants to label each other, and
people that use the same html are getting looked down upon for
it.</p>

What is wrong here? Why are there so many groups that are against
each other? All these people do is go around dissing other groups
or people. Stop the madness! We are not against hackers, we are
hackers, it's not us against us, and the government against us.
It is us against the government and the government against us
(sometimes). It seems a lot of the hackers out there, have lost
their ethics. Remember when you were learning? You were told to
read, and when you read, all you read was that hackers don't
destroy systems. Those are crackers. Well, I think those thics
have slipped. I've seen numerous displays of a 'hacker' trying to
intimidate another. No one cares, no one actually sits around,
and waits for the other 'hacker' to strike back, so there's no
point in it. Grow up. We don't think you're cool, we think you're
lame.</p>

<p align="center"><br>
Yeah, it's time for me to rant on and on about NATO. I find it
rather hard to believe that the USA can use satelites, to look
through your bedroom window, but can't aim enough to miss an
embassy? All those Serb troops (like 500+) escaped somehow, and
we can't seem to find them? This strikes me as odd, if not
pathetic. We claim that NATO is helping, that we are the Robin
Hood's, and we'll save Kosovo. This is bullshit. We're not saving
anyone, we're killing others, two wrongs do not make a right. If
we're doing such a good job, why do we see pictures of innocent
people being killed in Kosovo, shouldn't we have killed off the
bad guys, before we hit the Chinese Embassy? Maybe if they didn't
lie, maybe if we saw what was really going on, we wouldn't think
the same way.</p>

Your worked is backed up as 'index2.htm' Rename index2.htm to
index.htm and you're all set, it's not $100 000 worth of damage,
I didn't delete anything, just renamed your files. Sorry for the
trouble I caused.</p>
