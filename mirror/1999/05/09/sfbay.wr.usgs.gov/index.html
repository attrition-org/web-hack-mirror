<center>This is where everything goes crazy, this is where the whole world turns upside 
down, and everybody that thought there was such a thing called gravity falls out
of this huge bowl we call Earth. This is our world, this is where we come to play.
This is where we belong, and where we overthrow you.</center>

<center>I'm sick of people getting into arguments, hacking was not started so that p people
could diss each other, it was started so we could do anything we want. Stop fighting! 
This is supposed to be us versus the government, not us versus us, and the government 
versus us. I feel sorry for those of you who get caught up into that crap about who's
leeter, it's pretty pathetic. Seriously, do you think that we wait for the opposing
team to hack back and swear? Stop the insanity!</center>

<center>Nothing was deleted in this hack, your files are backed up at 'access_sfb2.html'.
A simple 'mv access_sfb2.html access_sfb.html' oughta do the trick, not $100 000
worth of damage. Sorry, for the inconvenience, this site was comprimised, not 
because I dislike you, but because it was vulnerable.</center><p>
