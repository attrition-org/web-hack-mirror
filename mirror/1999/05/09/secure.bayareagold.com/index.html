               once again our message is simple - free kevorkian.
he did not commit murder, he helped a terminally ill sufferer to ease his pain
the us government r just to fucking pigheaded to recognise this. pigheaded or 
just fucked. like we all know kevorkian is innocent, yet he goes to jail. we all
               know oj simpson was guilty and yet he walks free. 



                       ironic isnt it - justice its not
