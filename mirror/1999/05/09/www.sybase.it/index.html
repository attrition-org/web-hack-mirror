Rootwar niggas just penerated your box due to inadequate security. Secure your system to prevent this from happening again. Comprehendo? 
In other words....if it lacks security, we'll be back. But if it's patched up, we'll stay the FUCK out.  Is it too complicated a concept for you system adminstrators to comprehend?  Subscription to <a href="http://www.netspace.org">http://www.netspace.org </a>will help too...keeps you updated on some vulnerabilities.<br>
