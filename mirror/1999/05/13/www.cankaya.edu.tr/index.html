	I have received much criticism from people stating that the way I hate the Turks is just stupid because they have done
nothing wrong. Or the ever so popular 'they haven't done anything to the Greeks since 1821 or World War 2'. Clarification,
they never stopped doing anything to my brethren Greeks and cousin Cypriots. This following information was compiled by
<font color="#cc33cc">The Infinite Budha</font> (Stonehenge Crew), a Greek who knows what he is talking about. Read it
thoroughly, view the graphics, and then come up with a decision about the Turks for yourselves. No matter your decision, it
won't change my opinion on them. (When I say Turks, I mean the military mainly, whom are ordered to rape, murder, and break
innocent Kurds and Greeks... and enjoy doing it. The simple Turks, I have no quarrel with.) If you have any small children,
people with heart problems, etc, you might not want them to see the images at the bottom of this page.<p>

	<p>CYPRUS, an independent country, was invaded by Turkey in 1974. Two hundred thousand Cypriots of Greek and Maronite
descent were forced out of their homes in northern Cyprus and became refugees in the south. Many thousands were killed,
injured, or raped. Large numbers of illegal settlers were brought in from mainland Turkey and most Cypriots of Turkish descent
were forced into exile. <p>Occupied Northern Cyprus has a puppet government controlled by Turkey and protected by 40,000
Turkish soldiers. As specified by many International Agencies (eg. Amnesty International), Turkey has one of the worst records
on Human Rights violations in the world. <p>Numerous<a href="http://www.kypros.org/Cyprus_Problem/UN.html"> United Nations
Resolutions</a> calling for the immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops and the return of all refugees to their homes have been
blatantly ignored by Turkey. Meanwhile, the plight of the Cypriot people goes on. No refugee has ever been allowed back in
Occupied Northern Cyprus. When they try to go back they are brutally <a href="http://kypros.org/Cyprus_Problem/">attacked
and murdered</a> by the Turkish Occupation Forces. <p><b>We ask you kindly not to visit Occupied Northern Cyprus</b> and thus
financially, morally, and politically provide support for the illegal and barbaric occupation of our homelands. Thank you for
your understanding and we wish you a pleasant stay in Free Cyprus. <p>NOTE: Visiting Occupied Northern Cyprus also 
constitutes a serious personal safety and health hazard. The following, for example, apply to Occupied Northern Cyprus.
<p>1)There are reports of endemic hydatid disease, brucellosis, rabies, salmonellosis and bacterial meningitis. <p>2)The
incidence of serious crime and road traffic accidents is very high. <p>3) Medical facilities are of a very low standard.

	<center><h3>Kurd Sufferage</h3></center><p>
	The pictures published here are evidence of a savagery that took place in April 1995 in the district of Hakkari in the
Kurdish regions of southeastern Turkey. The perpetrators of this act were Turkish soldiers, members of the Hakkari Mountain
Brigadier Command, and the victims are four members of the People's Liberation Army of Kurdistan (ARGK). These photos were
featured on the cover of the January 11-17 edition of the London weekly "The European". The savagery of the Turkish
state is not limited to the Kurdish regions of Turkey, however. During its cross-border operation in northern Iraq in March
and April of 1995, disregarding international outcry, members of the Turkish armed forces massacred seven shepherds in Dahok
in the same manner. Do not misunderstand this message: This is not simply exterminating the Kurdish people, this is
terminating humanity. <b>Halt This Savagery!</b>
