<h1>This page was just hacked on 5-19-99 by Analognet, Knyte Rage and King Dragon.</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Evening folks, how are you all?? Well I do hope.&nbsp; My name is Knyte Rage and I will
be your guest speaker for the evening.</p>

<p>First off Id like to congratulate Analognet and his wife on their first child, which
whom middle name is taken from me :o)</p>

<p>I also want to mention&nbsp; UHA1.COM, I found an interesting screen play there and it
kicks major fucking&nbsp;&nbsp; ASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; also
check out THEWARINDUSTRIES.COM also another good sight I stumbled upon.</p>

<p>Well, right now we seem to be on some sort of tropical vacation. Ya know that's why we
haven't owned more sites.&nbsp; Vacation is good.&nbsp; I love these mixed drinks with the
umbrellas, Yummy!!!</p>

<p>I bet some of you are wondering why we did this.&nbsp; That's Simple, because we seek
the knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also we did it, simply, because we can and you can't.&nbsp; I
would also like to extend greetings and salutations to EHA, ::coughing:: losers

educational, its at the WWW MESSAGE BAORDS @ THEWARINDUSTRIES.COM hee hee, check it
