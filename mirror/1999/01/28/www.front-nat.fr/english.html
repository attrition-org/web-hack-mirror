<h1>Welcome to the 'FRONT FACHO' site</h1>
<font size=+1>This political movement sanctionned by French laws, which encourage/condone racial inequity and create total insecurity, is validated by 15% of the French(France) who are not people who have lost their roots but very truly real fascists, racists whom we have already met under Petain. Petainists are all that, democracy is coming to an end. Can we discuss with those people who make the worst in men come back to the surface. Thanks to democracy.

<B><I>Call to the dissolution of the FN after the Vitrolles incidents</I></B>
<BR><B>PARIS</B>may 24, Reuter - The socialist senator Jean-Luc Mélenchon,
the ecologist Marie-Christine Blandin, président of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais regional council, and the writer François Cavanna have, with others, launched a call to the dissolution of the FN, after Friday Morning's incidents at Vitrolles, in the Bouches-du-Rhône.

In a communiqué (sorta like a letter or press release) published that evening, they announce the creation of the "Mouvement pour la dissolution du Front national" (Movement for the dissolution of the FN), underlining that it is a "civic, democratic, and social requirement" because French law (January 10, 1936 law completed in 1972) prevents associations which cause armed protests in the streets or incite to racial hatred.The communiqué is also signed by three of Charlie Hebdo's collaborators (Val, Charb, and Cabu) and by the european deputy Aline Pailler. 
In another communiqué, the police officers' union (Centrale unitaire de la police) demands an investigation on the DPS, the FN's order service, and calls to dissolution in the name of this same law. Vivid incidents oposedFN militants to members of anti-racist associations on a marketplace at Vitrolles.
The confrontation started when Bruno Mégret - general delegate whose wife Catherine is the mayor of the city since februrary - and his team, who were distribution flyers on the marketplace, crossed "Ras l'Front" militants who were accompanied by "SOS-Racisme" (sos-racism) president Fodé Sylla.After exchanging "bad words" tear-gas was used and militants on both sides resorted to using their fists. Police forces had to intervene to separate the antagonists. According to the FN, Claude Bourges, a collegue of Catherine Mégret's, was injured to the jaw. Bruno Mégret announced that his wife had pressed charges, mainly against Fodé Sylla, for "inciting to violence followed by acts". Fodé Sylla asserted that a member of the Mégret couple's order service "took a gun out" at the beginning of the incidents. He added that Bruno and Catherine Mégret, accompanied by a "oppressing order service", had "started to shove everyone around" and that tear-gas had been thrown "in a supercharged and fascist atmosphere".
