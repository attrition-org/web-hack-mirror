*sigh* You already know the deal.  gH just thought they would let it be
known the disgust we have in milw0rm's hacked sites.  I have found no
point in the altering of homepages nor do i see any style nor effort put
into them either.  As you can see i myself use the same html format
everytime just because i don't see the need to do html from scrath
everytime i 0wn a site and only see it up for like a few hours.  For those
who don't know about milw0rm, they hang on undernet (us.undernet.org) and
hang in #rootworm which is registered because they know that they have no
power nor any backup to help them hold their home channel.  Undernet
groups are lame in general and itz pointless to even connect to undernet
since itz irc network can be lagged by a 14.4 :)  milw0rm i hope you all
remember the prohosting.com shit that went on and i have waited long
enough to humiliate you bitches world wide again in the "hacking" scene.

	<p>China deserves a kick in the ass as much as milw0rm does.
Sentencing a "hacker" to death is way out of line.  I don't see how
computers can get you charged and sentenced to death.  Itz stupid how this
all worked out, but since your sentencing i know you china admins have
seen and will see plenty more sekurity breakins on your systems just to
show you how stupid the decision was to punish the "hacker" so
intensively.  Recently LoU called cyberwar on china & iraq but i have seen
nothing done about it.  I used to hang wif LoU, but now that i have seen
the media wh0rez real sides, i don't hang their anymore.  LoU consists of
20% people wif skill, 50% of kids and irc newbies and 30% media wh0rez,
reporters and people who just snoof what they are doing.  If they want a
cyberwar, i myself will bring them one personally like i have done in the
past.  
<p> Legions of the Underground - This goes to you fuckers, if you wanna
cyberwar then so it be, i will wait for a reply to this hack and knowing
you guys it will be some dumb site that even my mom could root using phf &
statd skillz.  I'm sorry i 0wned a major chineese box since you know, you
called cyberwar and stuff, but face it.  You have no skillz, no
organization and half of the "hackers" on irc after you guys for giving us
"Real Hackers" a bad name and making us get labled as INTERNET TERRORISTS.
Now Fuck Off.

	<p>LoU i'm sorry but we used to be kewl <br>
If you wanna cyberwar then do what you do. <br>
Get fucked everyway possible, with no way out <br>
gLobaL heLL's fucking your baby's moma making her scream and shout. <br>
<br>
gH vs. Lou is no kinda match nor worth it <br>
optiklenz has to read BitchX.doc to know how to work it. <br>
Don't worry, we ain't even stressing it <br>
but if you wanna start a way, you know we'll be wrecking it. <br>
<br>
Catching us will never happen nor will you come close <br>
because most admins are 12year old man page reading kiddies at the most.
<br>
Our hacks and html skills are here for you to view for free <br>
so if you attempt to catch up wif gH then we will hang your nuts on our
Christmas Tree. <br>
