several countries has been outstanding, however the laws in Russia and Japan suck. &nbsp;
So we've adopted a more aggressive approach to sites that originate from .ru and .jp&nbsp;

<p><strong>So, we're going to &quot;assist&quot; in removing these sites whenever we find
them.&nbsp; No hosting service is safe from our ability to take them over, so it is in
their best interest to not host child pornography.</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>To the people at gen.com,</u> wake the hell up.&nbsp; This is a harmless
compromise intended to bring attention to the issue at hand.&nbsp; You guys desperately
need to get a grip on security and pay attention to the type of material you host. &nbsp;
Fortunately for gen.com we chose this path - image how long your servers would be offline
if Law Enforcement confiscated them for hosting child pornography.&nbsp; I'm sure your
customers would be thrilled to know your security sucks AND you support Child
Pornography.&nbsp; Get with the program or we'll revisit you.</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>To the people *cough* at asdy.com</u>, things are going to get interesting
for you.&nbsp; Sit tight and enjoy the ride.&nbsp; Now would be an excellent time to clean
up your act and stop supporting child pornography.</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>To the pedophiles</u>, be aware that no site is safe from our reach. &nbsp;
You have no idea of how long we've owned this server, nor how much information we've
gathered about it's visitors.&nbsp; You also have no idea how many other sites we own as
well.&nbsp; You should feel very naked in light of our ability to track your activities,
as you never know if we're watching.&nbsp; Look for us to visit other sites with our
message.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Oh yeah, no group will be taking credit for this as it's not done by any
organized group.&nbsp; So when all the script kids start writing 3|3373 claims about this
one, you'll know they're lying.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Until next time ...&nbsp; </strong></p>
