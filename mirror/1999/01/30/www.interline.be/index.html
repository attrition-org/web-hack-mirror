 <b><h3>Fighting is not something to be proud of, but someone has
to do it.</h3></b>

 <br>
 <ul>
 <p>Biological weapons, chemical weapons, and nuclear weapons, none
of these can stop us...
 For we are not here, yet we sit before our computers and proceed
with such malicious activities.
 Cyberspace is a new battlefield and we have the advantage. Our
advantage is not experience or
 weapons, but we have the will to push us and the morale to keep
fighting until the end. You can kill
 us, imprison us, and torture us but we will <b>never</b> give
in.</p>
 
 <p>The image that your government gives us is an obese little
techo-nerd that wants revenge for all
 of the bullies that picked on us is school. None of this is
true... Our cause is to wake you up
 from the fake reality that they have put in your minds, to let you
see the real world and to experience
 the poverty, war, and ailments that is happening right now. The
government created us and now they
 want to destroy us. In the end, it's reality you have to face, not
what the government gives you. 
 We are doing this for the people who cannot fight for themselves
and those who neglect the fight for the
 helpless.</p>
 
 <p>Our time is coming soon. Our front is gaining more territory
every minute. The government
 can put all their men on the front lines, but we can walk right
through them. When we reach the central
 government we will stop... For we cannot go any further. <b>But
Why?</b> The government has filled your
 heads with so many lies that the people will stop supporting us.
The time is now, wake up, face the truth.
 We are not the enemies, it is you, your neighbor, and the people
who supposedly protect you. Join
 us and regain the freedom that is rightfully yours.</p>

 <p>Thanks to our premature reporting of your security bug, further
complications have been avoided.
 Malicious hackers with bad intentions could have destroyed your
entire Internet Service that would
 leave the customers with no other choice then to switch to another
ISP. Therefore we fixed your bug
 because you would never have figured out how to secure it.
