<B><H2>A Cyberpunk Manifesto</H2></B>

<BR>
<B>1/ </B>We are those, the Different. Technological rats, swimming in the ocean of
information.<BR> 
<B>2/</B> We are the retiring, little kid at school, sitting at the 
last desk, in the corner of the class room. <B>3/</B> We are the teenager everybody considers strange
<B>4/</B> We are the student hacking 
computer systems, exploring the depth of his reach. <B>5/</B> We are the grown-up
in the park, sitting on a bench, laptop on his knees, programming the last
virtual reality. <B> 6/</B> Ours
is the garage, stuffed with electronics. The soldering iron in the corner
of the desk and the nearby disassembled radio- they are also ours. Ours is 
the cellar with computers, buzzing printers and beeping modems.
<B>7/</B> We are those that see reality in a different way. Our point of view shows 
more than ordinary people can see. They see only what is outside, but we see 
what is inside. That's what we are - realists with the glasses of dreamers.
<B>8/</B> We are those strange people, almost unknown to the neighborhood. People, 
indulged in their own thoughts, sitting day after day  before the computer, 
ransacking the net for something. We are not often out of home, just from 
time to time, only to go to the nearby radio shack, or to the usual bar to 
meet some of the few friends we have, or to meet a client, or to the 
backstreet druggist... or just for a little walk. <B>9/</B> We do not have many 
friends, only a few with whom we go to parties. Everybody else we know we 
know on the net. Our real friends are there, on the other side of the line. 
We know them from our favorite IRC channel, from the News-Groups, from the 
systems we hang-around: <B>10/</B> We are those who don't give a shit about what 
people think about us, we don't care what we look like or what people talk 
about us in our absence. <B>11/</B> The majority of us likes to live in hiding, 
being unknown to everybody except those few we must inevitably contact with. 
<B>12/</B> Others love publicity, they love fame. They are all known in the 
underground world. Their names are often heard there.<BR>
      But we are all united by one thing - we are Cyberpunks.<BR>
<BR>
<B>13/</B> Society does not understand us, we are "weird" and "crazy" people in 
the eyes of the ordinary people who live far from information and free ideas.
Society denies our way of thinking - a society, living, thinking and 
breathing in one and only one way - a clichc. <B>14/</B> They deny us for we 
think like free people, and free thinking is forbidden. <B>15/</B> The Cyberpunk 
has outer appearance, he is no motion. Cyberpunks are people, starting from 
the ordinary and known to nobody person, to the artist-technomaniac, to the 
musician, playing electronic music, to the superficial scholar. <B>16/</B> The 
Cyberpunk is no literature genre anymore, not even an ordinary subculture. 
The Cyberpunk is a stand-alone new culture, offspring of the new age. 
A culture that unites our common interests and views. We are a unit. We are 
Cyberpunks.<BR>
