<h2>
<center>Warning - Your NT 4.0 Server Is Not As Secure As Microsoft Claims It Is</center>
</h2>
<p>
The security of your system has been compromised within seconds. Access to every share on
your NT 4.0 Server (including all hidden shares) has been gained soon after. This is a 
Class A Security Hole.
<p>
What you need to know:<br>
It is noted that Microsoft Windows NT 4.0's Security is rated at C2 by the NCSA. However, 
they won't tell you that this means. What this means is that it was rated C2 as: 1)
Standalone; non-networked 2) Only rated on Compaq Proliant 2000 and 4000 Pentium and a 
DECpc AXP/150 Alpha. <p>
Further: <br>
I will not tell you what to do, but I feel you need to spend more time on
security. How would you feel if a malicous person destroyed your system?
<p>
Why I did this:<br>
It's a rather simple way to say a lot about Microsoft. I did not do this to 'shove it in
your face'. Rather, i did it to let others know more of the truth about Windows NT. Why does
the world fall for the so-called security of Microsoft? I don't know. It is through this
train of thought that I can not say "Eye 0wnz j00". Instead, bow your knee to 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>; but only if you want to.
