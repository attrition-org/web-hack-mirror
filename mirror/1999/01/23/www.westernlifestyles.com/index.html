<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Tahoma">Hey... I'm back
again. I've decided to stop defacing so many servers because
people have been pressuring me that defacing webpages is immature
and lacks ethics even though I do no damage... So I've given in
and I'll be laying low for a while. It was fun while it lasted
but I guess just 0wning stuff does get boring after a while. Oh
and I have a few messages, I'm sorry to gh for dissing them on
some of my hacks but me and MostHateD are cool now, and to all
the people pressuring me to stop deafacing webpages this one's
for you. And for all those people saying I scan for everything I
hack... I don't think. So I'm out but you can still find me on
EFnet at #hackphreak or e-mail me at </font><a
