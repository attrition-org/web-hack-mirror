<p> There are hackers all over the world. and these FBI fuckers think they can stop us from one day to another. HAHA that makes me crack up<p> The feds are locking down hackers from gH for no reason. they are locking down people that dont deserve it and thats why this is the time when HACKERS need to unite and fight for our rights.
<br> They are trying to lock down f0rpaxe members as well. but there are to many of us and they just wont finish us.
<p>Message to the owner of the page : DONT BLAME US , BLAME THE FBI. we wont stop owning servers until they get in their knees and beg for forgiveness.
<p> y0 gH & f0rpaxe count me in. These fuckers cant stop us.
<p>Greets : Microchip/in0de/phrazer/gH/ & and all the people that are with us.</font></p>
