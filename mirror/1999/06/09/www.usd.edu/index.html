        <td width="46%"><p>We are back. We admit it, we are
        owned. Hackers own our lame asses. We thought we could
        hold you all down by raiding a bunch of innocent hackers,
        but we failed. Here is a little FYI. It is true, the FBI
        is a group of gay hackers. We were supposed to be the
        GBI, The Gay Bureau of Investigation. But, there was an
        error in a newspaper calling us the FBI. We thought it
        sounded better so we went along with it. Besides, it
        would help keep our cover better. </p>
        <p>Most of our time is spent beating off to gay porno
        magazines while our fellow agents get anally molested by
        the CIA, the Central Impotence Agency. From my ten years
        with the FBI, my anal orifice has become a whopping eight
        inches wide from all the anal sex0r.</p>
        <p>Well, I have to go now. My gay boyfriend is paging me.
        I just love to stroke his cock while a cock is inside my
        ass. =-O~~</p>
        <p>We are owned by: gH, p0gO, ne0h, Devil-C, KoLdKuTtA,
        ox1dation, OpticMyst, chr0nicle, f0rpaxe, Level 7,
        Defiance, Bell (cuz they have nice toys), eckis, v00d00,
        Mozy, Cyrus, jennicide, MagicFX, DigiAlmty, and the rest
        of the hacking scene.</p>
        <p>We are NOT owned by: the posse (cuz they are lame
        kiddies).</p>
