The content of both attachments are identical, and include a<br>graphic of the FBI Seal.&nbsp; The attachments are more suitable for<br>duplication and distribution to Executives and other decision makers, or<br>as a part of a security newsletter, training package, or other<br>informational purpose. <br><br>Any questions may be directed to Special Agent Richard Haidle, FBI Los<br>Angeles Awareness of National Security Issues and Response (ANSIR)<br>Coordinator, at 310-996-3557 (Voice), or 800-734-1288 (Fax, only good for<br>calls within California), or by email to rhaidle@leo.gov . <br><br><br>THE CURRENT ADVISORY FOLLOWS:<br><br>ANSIR Email -- NIPC Hacker Advisory (99-010)<br><br>National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) Well-publicized Hacker<br>Activity Against U.S.&nbsp; Government Sites (NIPC warning 99-010) <br><br>Ref: NIPC information system advisory 99-008 (11 May 99)&nbsp; This Awareness<br>of National Security Issues and Response (ANSIR)&nbsp; communication is<br>intended for corporate security professionals and others who have<br>requested to receive unclassified national security advisories. This<br>communication is not a press release and should not be furnished to those<br>who are not direct recipients of ANSIR Program disseminations or<br>republished in any public format without specific authorization from the<br>National ANSIR Program at FBIHQ. Media requests should be directed to the<br>local FBI field office media representative. <br><br>The purpose of this advisory is to summarize recent, well-publicized<br>hacker activity against U.S.&nbsp; Government sites and provide an assessment<br>and recommendations. <br><br>On 26 May, the FBI Dallas office executed numerous simultaneous search<br>warrants. Some of the individuals included in the searches were from the<br>hacker group Global Hell.&nbsp; Allegedly because of these searches, persons<br>claiming to be members of the group took credit for a subsequent denial of<br>service attack on the FBI web site (hosted by IBM Global Networks). The<br>U.S. Senate web site was also reportedly hacked in response to the FBI<br>searches by the hacker group Masters of Downloading. Over the Memorial Day<br>weekend, public reports of additional searches involving Global Hell<br>members were followed by additional web page hacks including the<br>Department of Interior (claimed by Global Hell) and the Department of<br>Energy&#39;s Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (claimed<br>by F0RPAXE). <br><br>The reference message identifies the Portuguese hacker group F0RPAXE and<br>their initial activity over the past six weeks. In addition to the DOE<br>Idaho laboratory, F0RPAXE has claimed responsibility (on attrition.org)<br>for dozens of additional web page hacks over the past few days of various<br>commercial and public sites. These claims are uncorroborated and<br>inconsistent with their prior U.S. Government and military web page<br>hacking over the past six weeks. Unlike before, this weekend&#39;s hacking<br>suggests the use of automated tools, and the language in their weekend<br>statement reflects more hacker support than a Portuguese protest agenda.<br>There is little direct evidence that F0RPAXE is really or strictly a<br>Portuguese-associated group. <br><br>Ongoing investigations of this recent hacker activity may involve<br>individuals both in the United States and overseas which highlights the<br>lack of political and geographic boundaries in cyber space. This recent<br>hacker activity may continue and may include a protest of and/or response<br>to an expected June sentencing of Kevin Mitnick. The techniques used in<br>all the attacks are well- known denial of service exploits, including cold<br>fusion, automated access or Smurf attacks, and website vandalism involving<br>intrusion into the website server. <br><br>Recommendations: NIPC suggests that recipients consider the following<br>actions to protect information systems and networks: System and network<br>administrators should examine their systems for intrusion exploits and<br>report them as appropriate. These exploits could include intrusions<br>originating or passing through dial-up connections belonging to foreign<br>Internet service providers, unauthorized system access, unusual or<br>disruptive E-mail traffic or web site activity, etc. System administrators<br>should also evaluate the presence and effectiveness of computer security<br>procedures required by their organization. These include network intrusion<br>detection, blocking or limiting unnecessary inbound traffic, regular<br>review of system logs, disabling inactive user accounts, password and<br>login ID changes, ensuring recommended patches are in place (almost all of<br>the intrusions observed to date utilized exploits with publicly available<br>patches), and similar actions. <br><br>NIPC encourages affected sites to retain as much relevant log information<br>as possible, while re- establishing their web presence as quickly as<br>organizational judgment and requirements suggest.&nbsp; Recipients are asked to<br>report suspicious activity to your local FBI field office ANSIR or NIPC<br>Coordinator and to your own organizational computer emergency response<br>group, as appropriate. The NIPC can be located at Internet web site:<br>www.nipc.gov. <br><br>The Los Angeles office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is located<br>at 11000 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90024.&nbsp; The telephone number<br>is 310-477-6565.&nbsp; The FBI Los Angeles Awareness of National Security<br>Issues and Response (ANSIR)&nbsp; Coordinator is Special Agent Richard Haidle. <br>Special Agent Haidle may be contacted at 310-996-3557 (voice),<br>800-734-1288 (fax), or rhaidle@leo.gov (email).&nbsp; If you are aware of<br>individuals that would be interested in receiving future advisories, or<br>would like to add others within your organization to the list of<br>recipients, please forward the following information: <br><br>Recipients Name<br>Email Address<br>Company/Organization Name<br>Postal Address<br>Voice Number<br>Fax Number<br><br>SA Haidle is also available to give presentations on various National<br>Security related issues to appropriate audiences.&nbsp; Presentations are not<br>classified, and will focus primarily on Economic Espionage and Theft of<br>Trade Secrets or Proprietary Information. <br><br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br>Version: 2.6.2<br><br>iQCVAwUBN10mjc2OVDpaKXD9AQGZdQP/b2C2tDrQvc15xAG/DhzSjmWNWC4RlrQn<br>I5E7VsxqrmC4E+5IDWCtEulsnXN3W92zpAqkUNNUogjwbMnkRq1nKsanh+30vbiH<br>lzX5z7XwxQcqlgJpGXZWwXtSI2zr4W7Dpu4oI05hy3V2RXyDRTCvWvI/HhqCzUR3<br>Ou7E7BGiO9I=<br>=aeSH<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br><br><br></font>
