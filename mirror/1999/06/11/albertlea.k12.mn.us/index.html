<h3>This had to been said one way or another so here it is<BR>
<BR>
Everyone currently in the "scene" needs to get a new attitude...<Br> things aren't the way they should be and haven't been for awhile.<br>
All of us need to realize that even though we may hate each other one way or another we have to get a long.<BR>
So no matter how "elite" you think you are stop acting like you are better then everyone else.<BR>
<br><br>
Hyperburn<br>
The Sacred Scene<br>
<br>
<br>
Lately, I've noticed the scene has changed over the last few years. I wouldnt<br>
say that these changes could have been avoided, but they are changes. Where as<br>
before, people werent as close of friends as many of us are today. Where as<br>
before, many of us would stay up until the wee hours of the night reading text,<br>
and trying out new things; Today, we go dumpster diving, and set up webpages. I<br>
dont think there is anything wrong with what goes on these days.<br>
<br><br>
But I think we need to look back, and ask ourselves which scene was more<br>
productive. I have looked back, and so have people that Ive talked to. We<br>
examined our lifestyles then and now. What we get accomplished then and now.<br>
And, it was very evident which era we chose.<br>
<br><br>
Hell, I even had a hard time getting this zine's usual writers to contribute<br>
anything. This has to be the most unorganized issue ever produced by evil<br>
empire. And why shouldnt it be? This scene doesnt pride itself on sharing<br>
information. It prides itself on irc, and mindless regurgitation of text files<br>
on webpages. We have to consider what we're doing. And ask ourselves what the<br>
"scene" has become. Because the old definition doenst work anymore.<br>
