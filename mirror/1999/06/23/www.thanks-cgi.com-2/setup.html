We sincerely apologize for our free setup service is no longer available. 
To comply with the company's regulations, we will be charging a nominal fee 
of US $35 per service. See following for detail. 
<hr>
Currently we can only accept UNIX setup due to the various conflicts 
between NT II4 Server and Perl.  Since the majority of our CGI script
were written in Perl, we strongly recommend NT users think twice before 
installing our CGI product. 
<br><br>
Practically speaking, please ensure your server supports CGI-BIN beforehand.
Because of our limited resources and other difficulties, we insist 
absolutely no refund if incompatibility takes place. On the other hand, our 
programs have successfully shown compatibility and workability on other 
servers. Therefore UNIX servers which support CGI can have 100% confidence 
in our script. 
<br><br>
We also provide Hosting service if you are looking for a Server that 
supports CGI script. (of course all our CGI scripts are then supported)
Please feel free to <a href="mailto:info@thanks-cgi.com?subject=UNIX SETUP">contact us</a> for further detail. Thanks!!
