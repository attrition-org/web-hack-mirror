		Why are they here?</font>

		- They want to show the world how 
		  big and mighty they actualy are..

		- Because they have no friends.

		- Because they don't have lives.

		- Because they have been rejected.
	
		- Because they are losers.

	Date: 1998/06/18 
	Author: Microchip (forpaxe@mail.telepac.pt)
  	 Posting History    
 
	I´m Microchip ,15, and i´m trying to learn some 
	hacking by myself becuase there isn´t a real 
	hacker capable of transmiting all is knowledge 
	to me in order to proceed his future career like 
	if i was his child.
	I had got my schools e-mail and i had already 
	done some mailbombimg etc.. I am thinking in a 
	real hack. I thought about it and i had realize 
	that i could simulte an importante message attached 
	with a program made by me. I would make a 
	program wicth ould get the password and username 
	of my school witch is conected to Ip.
	For example. I will build a program sayng some 
	school info but the program will execute a program 
	that records all the keys pressed by the user to a 
	log file. Then when the school was online the program 
	would e-mail me the log file using my e-mail program 
	made by me.
	I had already done the fake program and the e-mail 
	program. I just need to know how to detect that 
	the user is online and how to launch a program when 
	he is online in order to transpose the information 
	to my computer.

   	Posting History    
 
	Greetings. I started to build a web page a 
	few days ago. I  want to put my menu in the 
	left side but in order to be there all the time
	whithout  being scrool down or up. For example:
	------------------------------------------------
	
	/////////////        /    ............
	/  s
	/ menu/        /    aaaaaa                                          
	/  c /          /        /      bbbbb
	/    r
	/          /        /
	/    o
	/          /        /
	/    o
	////////////        /
	/    l
 
 
	When I srool the page the menu stays on always on 
	it´s original position. How do I do It?
	I am building the page on publisher 98
	I have frontpage 97 too
	In www.motiv8.org they have a webpage with the 
	kind of look that i am trying to do (what refers to 
	the menu etc..)

		Are they hackers?</font>
		
		.. what do you think?

		F0rpaxe hacks
		Operating Systems hacked.
		from least to most.

		-] 2 mass hacks of both NT servers. 
  		   - 1st mass: 51 servers.
   		   - 2nd mass: 6 servers.
		-] 3 servers (down)
		-] 7 servers (likely) to be other than NT.
		-] 10 servers (still) running cold fusion.
		-] 60 servers running Windows NT.
		-] Total of: 137 servers 

		Prepare to be schooled in 'F0rpaxe techniques'

		1. Double click on  'INTERNET EXPLORER'

		2. Find a URL you want to 'hack'
		   put in: 

		   http://www.server.com/cfdocs/expeval/openfile.cfm 

Select a file to upload from your local machine and submit it. You will 
then be forwarded to a web page displaying the contents of the file you 
uploaded. The URL will look something like: 
<font size=1>cfdocs/expeval/ExprCalc.cfm?RequestTimeout=2000&OpenFilePath=C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\cfdocs\expeval\.\myfile.txt</font>
Now replace the end of the URL where it shows ".\myfile.txt" with 
"ExprCalc.cfm". Going to this URL will delete "ExprCalc.cfm" so that web 
users can now use "openfile.cfm" to upload files to the web server 
without them being deleted. With some knowledge of Cold Fusion a web user 
can upload a Cold Fusion page that allows them to browse directories on 
the server as well as upload, download and delete files. Arbitrary 
executable files could placed anywhere the Cold Fusion service has 
access. Web users are not restricted to the web root. 

		Ta da.. now you can be an ELITE HACKER LIKE FORPAXE.
		if you can't figure this out.. visit the page of
		Forpaxe's BEST FRIENDS..

		<a href="http://www.l0pht.com">The L0pht. (Hi RAgent.)</a>

		In fact, anyone can be like Forpaxe.
		All you need is a browser.
		Pretty spiffy, eh?
	
		In conclution, the media calls Forpaxe 'Hackers'
		opening a browser is not considered a 'hack'
		please, bare with me.. these people are lame.

		See? Im not the only one who thinks Forpaxe is

		system, there is no sniffers running, there is no
		tools, or hacking from your system going on. I have
		already left. You can look as much as you like, I am
		long gone from your site. Im not malicious, in fact,
		I even patched up the hole in your system before I 
		left.. Sorry for any inconvinience.
