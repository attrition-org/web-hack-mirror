Dear world,</strong></p>

<p align="center">How is it possible that two countries, that much alike<br>
are in constant battle with each other?<br>
<br>
As i qoute from CNN:<br>
<em>&quot;South Korea has accused the North of firing first <br>
after its warships sailed back and forth across the sea&quot;</em><br>
<br>
A country is for 99,9% made up out<br>
of it's people.<br>
<br>
But did they start this new crisis?<br>
<br>
No, the South and North Korean _goverment_ did.<br>
But are they going to be the victems? <br>
Are they the ones suffering when a brutal war starts?<br>
<br>
No, the real victems are (again) the normal people, working<br>
hard to make a living and not educated about what's really going on.<br>
<br>
Is this battle going to be another waste of many, many<br>
precious lives just to save the ego of some<br>
high-placed people?<br>
<br>
Let stop this fucking bullshit<br>
and cooperate to make a difference.<br>
