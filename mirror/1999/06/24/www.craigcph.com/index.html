<p align="center">Money is the key top end all your wo's,<br>
your up's and down's<br>
your high's and your low's<br>
Why don't you tell me the last time that love bought your
clothes,<br>
It's Like That, and that's the way it is.<br>
-- As told by Run DMC and Jason Nevus... our hero's.</p>

<p>This is another one for tonight, the fed's are smart, there's
no doubt about that, we're not calling them dumb, because they
aren't. They have technology, we do too. quoted well here:</p>

<pre>
		&quot;That's the reason I'm mad at the fed's, because they're
		trying to take matters into their own hands, when half
		of the server's don't even care.. because I help them.&quot;

<p>That's what I'm talking about, they think they're all
high-and-mighty but they don't realize, that they are making us
out to be worse than we are, and that half of the admin's won't
press charges, because we are helping them fix their problems.</p>

<p>The hacks against the government are stupid, they make our
rules, so whats up with that.. we keep hacking them, and the
rules will tighten. I'm not saying stop, just cut down.. okay? I
know that they're an easy target, but some of the server's are
setup with holes to catch us, if you're hacking nasa.gov with PHF
something wrong@!$!#@^%!@%^ Damn son!</p>
