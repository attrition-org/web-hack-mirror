<p>The wierdest part of the whole thing is, I keep contradicting
myself (wait, no I don't) in this whole thing, and people are
letting me get away with it. It's not something I try and do,
it's just that my views are always changing... I'm sure you
understand.</p>

<p align="center">%/%The Conscience of a Hacker/%/<br>
Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they
look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that
you will never forgive me for.<br>
<br>
I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this
individual, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all
alike.<br>

<p>That's right... Jesus Christ! The Mentor is dope, I love that
piece. I know you love it too so don't lie. A word to who is
coming to this site to read what it usually has to offer, I'm
sorry. This was because I lack the life to go do other stuff
right now. Maybe it's wrong, maybe not. Don't judge me for the
colour of my skin, or how I play the game (And that's what this
is. A game.), hate me for who I am.</p>

<p align="center">just move your old index file (index2.html) to
