<p>Yeah, it's time once again, for everybody to hop along the HO
TRAIN! (WWF fans will know that one). Pimpin' aint easy, and the
kiddies finally get out of school, so html skills are gonna be
flying. This isn't elite, it's not. I'm not stupid, I know elite,
maybe my defacements aren't k-rad, but these are for fun,
although there might be reason behind them, there's no doubting
that I am just doing this for fun.</p>

<p>This shit is going crazy... I can't believe I'm still here
doing this shit, thought I woulda got bored by now. I thought
this was gonna be a one time thing, how come I keep on going? How
come I'm not stopping, I am being sucked in by this force we call
hacking... let me out, I'm just a man, making a difference. Call
it what you want.. I'm bored, and this shit is too easy!</p>

<p>I didn't delete anything from your page, just renamed
index.html to index2.html, all you have to do is rename
index2.html to index.html and you're set, I didn't install
trojans or backdoor anything, I promise... Just rename and you're
ready to go again, any problems, contact me. You know where.</p>

<p>I pulled up to the club like your love, I thought she said
thug, but she called me a scrub, that musta been a joke lucky
pigeon haired freak, lucky I spoke! That aint my car, that aint
your hair, uh-oh.. pigeon take your friends jewels off. Uh-oh
pigeon take your friends shoes off, NOOO I don't want no pigeons!
Pigeon is a girl who gets no doves from me, playing the bardem
broke, which her best friends coat, trying to holler at me! (As
translated by i0nic)</p>
