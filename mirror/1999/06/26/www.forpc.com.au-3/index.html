/cfdocs/expeval/openfile.cfm

Fun, isn't it?  Wanna know how i got this?  They uploaded it themselves!
Don't believe me? </pre><A HREF="cfdocs/expeval/index.txt">I found it here</a><br>
They left <A HREF="cfdocs/expeval/Readme.txt">this</a> too.<pre>
I wish only wish I could be so l33t..  But enough bitching about the 
method, who really cares? Holes are holes, I guess.  What i wanna talk 
about is all these damn senseless defacing.  Why get up on your soapbox
if you don't have anything to say?  Hacking isn't about graffiti, it's about
exploring.  It's not about destruction, it's about knowledge.  Our crime is 
curiosity, not vandalism.  The medium is not the message, the message 
must stand by itself.
</pre>
<br>
Here's two texts for ya.  Read, learn, explore.<br><br>
<center><A Href=http://www.hackernews.com/orig/whoever.html>Buffer Overflow on defacement</a><br>
<A Href=http://www.attrition.org/~modify/texts/ethics/hackers_manifesto.html>Hacker's manifesto</a> - MUST READ<br>
<br></center>
BTW, if your questioning the ethics of this defacement, I could have changed all of these:
<pre>http://www.bigpineapple.com.au
http://www.2000plusair.com.au
http://www.caninebehaviour.com.au
http://www.chateauroyale.com.au
http://www.commhedge.com.au
http://www.cribbean.com.au
http://www.digital.com.au
