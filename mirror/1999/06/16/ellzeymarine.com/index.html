<p align="left">We disappeared for a while but we wanted you to
know that we are still here. We haven't disappeared. No fed's
caught us. There is no stopping, there is no looking back, this
is an addiction, this is not fun, this is not a fetish we have,
we can't stop ourselves, you can't stop us, no one can save us,
we are doomed (mwashwashwash$@$@#%&amp;%&amp;).<br>
<br>
We're back, and this time we're coming stronger than ever, but
first, I must say that I'm sorry. In my first hack, I called
xhostile a lamer, and later, I stated that I was sick of hackers
putting one another down. Brought to my attention, I wanted to
say that I apologize to xhostile, though we still do not get
along. This is our world, we must keep it as sane as possible.
People can come in and bad mouth each other, but it makes no
difference. It makes us look stupid, we're better than this.<br>

your inner thigh<br>
&lt;Devil-C&gt; You're fucking sick.. get the hell away, you fat
piece of shit<br>
&lt;Carolyn-Meinel&gt; I want your balls in my mouth<br>
&lt;Devil-C&gt; You would.<br>

Anyways.. I ask again where the INDIANhackers have gone.. are
they exactly what they called others? A fad that died away? We're
here.. we've been here the whole time. You hacked all your sites
with wu-ftp. We know that. But it takes less skill to go out and
hack something with another exploit. Just come back for one hack
and I'll be pleased.<br>
