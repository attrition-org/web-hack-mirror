<p align="center">I am realy sick of all this talk of baning paintball.&nbsp; paintball is
a sport.&nbsp; if you ban paintball guns becuase they *vandilize* property than lets ban
real guns first.&nbsp; Real guns kill people.&nbsp; I know all of you would rather have a
yellow splat on your house than have a hole in your head.&nbsp; I think police need to
stop worrying about paintball vandilisum and worry about murders.&nbsp; Yea i see
paintball shootings on the tv once a month or so but i see 10-20 murders every night on tv
and when i see paintball shootsing its some kid who got a bruse.&nbsp; When i see muders
on tv they are dead.&nbsp; As in no more life.&nbsp; So please stop worying about
paintball and care more about the comunity.&nbsp; take care of murders, and much more
important stuff first.</p>

<p align="center">I know this hack has nothing to do with hacking but i am a BIG TIME
paintball player and this pisses me off.</p>
