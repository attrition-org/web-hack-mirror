<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Back again, hi, I would just like to
give a word of advice to the admin, you should be aware of little
holes like this, keep updated. I do not think I am elite. But to
all you people out there, just chill. I would also like to say
FREE KEVIN, he is an icon to mosy every hacker. And also give
thanks to my br0 m0zy for bein' such a g0od friend... I know the
NATO/Serb activity is pretty much over, but it was stupid on both
parts sort of... NATO could have used less force and avoided
hurting more people but on the other hand the Serbs could have
just let other's live in peace and believe in what they please...
Thats all f0lks.</font></p>
