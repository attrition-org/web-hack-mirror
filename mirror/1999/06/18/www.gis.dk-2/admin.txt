To the admin,

Your server has not actualy been 'hacked' but yet,
I have merely defaced your website in order to view
a few things out to you.

1. Hackers don't care what it is, first chance they
   get they will flock over you like a hawk and feast
   on your insides.

2. A hole in a server can cost you money, time, and
   most of all, perhaps your job. Please be aware
   hackers are everywhere, and there are more and more
   coming into your face as we speak.

3. Cold fusion is a lame bug, you should read up on your
   security if you want to run an efficient job. And get
   customers.. Do you think someone would want to be 
   hosted by someone who has been hacked 15 times?
   I don't think so.

4. The bug is 'openfile.cfm' a remote user can go into
   your system and send a file, so they can browse your
   hardrive, and delete and steal anything they feel.



Please, be more cautious next time.
I have cleaned your system of any temp files that take
up space, and got rid of my presence. Logs are wiped, 
incase you want to get smart, and the hole which was
placed is now gone, and can never return.


Thank you.
