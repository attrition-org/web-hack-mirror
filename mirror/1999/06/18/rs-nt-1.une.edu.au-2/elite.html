<pre>

* Attention *

This box (http://rs-nt-1.une.edu.au) that I have just
now re-'hacked' was first 'hacked' by Forpaxe.

Yes, this was cold fusion, No, I don't hack with cold 
fusion. I re-did this only because Forpaxe did it.


I rehacked http://fjsrc.urban.org/, but before attrition
saw it, it went down. I am posting the HTML I put on that
page, on this page, just to let the world know.

I will re-own every box Forpaxe has ever done, until
they admit absolute defeat by the unmerciful ne0h.

Forpaxe, you are owned.
Not because im not a hacker, or because im lame,

Because your sloppy.

* Attention *

Okay, son. Listen to ne0h one more time, you obviously didint
get my fucking message through.

Last hack:
(on this box, that is.)

>Forpaxe Owns You All
>l0l.... F0rpaxe had already reported that m1crochip 
>doesn´t have nothing to do with an asshole called João 
>Carlos Ramos Matos. 


- how did you know it had a ã in his name? 

>We have never posted that crap on 
>2600. 

Who said you posted it on 2600?

>It seems that guy had also named is group f0rpaxe,
>maybe to imitate us. 


right, the postings were made in '98, but you started
'hacking' right when cold fusion came out.. are you
telling us, these guys imitated you, a year ago? WOW
WE HAVE PSYCHIC HACKERS. whoohoo.. you dumbass.


>He was never a member of f0rpaxe 

heh. right.

>and is nickname is Microchip and not m1crochip (there 
>is a little difference: one is a lame nickname the other 
>is m1crochip real name).

>phone to what you belive to be m1crochip. l0l.

>We don´t 
>care about that asshole. If he wanted to imitate us 
>then FBI will be looking for him and not for us. Cool..

under Forpaxe.com ? Or is this my imagination? haha.

>. Shame on those who try to fight against us. 
>Those only show that they don´t support the scene.
