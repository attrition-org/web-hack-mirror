<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Arial Baltic"><strong>Ok,
this is a message to </strong></font><font size="6"
face="Arial Baltic"><strong>&quot;y0&quot;</strong></font><font
size="5" face="Arial Baltic"><strong>. The dumbass who call
himself the &quot;clean up crew&quot;.</strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Arial Baltic"><strong>Uhh,
what the fuck? </strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Arial Baltic"><strong>Here's
a quote:</strong></font></p>

<p align="center">&quot; Hey admin, these guys hacked your site
and left your holes wide open, I figure someone's gotta fix them.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial Baltic"><strong>First
of all, these sites werent &quot;hacked&quot; they were
&quot;defaced&quot; with a little file that was left by
Forpaxe/other group. Through a web-browser, just like you. You
&quot;figure&quot; someone's gotta fix them? Umm, ok, then
someone tell me what the &quot;admin's&quot; job is? To sit and
watch the logs?</strong></font></p>

<p align="center">Your welcome. BTW again, folks, if your gonna
cold fusion a server, assuming you have something important to
say (Other than slamming other groups!, <a
href="http://www.hackernews.com/orig/whoever.html">grow up</a>),
at least patch the hole up. Meaningless vandalism is stupid, get
over it. &quot;<br>
<font size="4" face="Arial Baltic"><strong>&quot;Your
welcome&quot; Hmm, thats like saying here, here, let ME shoot you
in the foot so you dont shoot yourself with at a later time. The
only reason &quot;we&quot; coldfusion a server is to do something
else, not show how &quot;r33t&quot; we are, like yourself. Why
would we have something to say on a CF server you dumbass. And
patch the hole up? To my knowledge, you need to have phsysical
access to the server to &quot;patch&quot; it up. Although you CAN
DELETE some files, but thats not &quot;patching&quot; is it?</strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial Baltic"><strong>&quot;Meaningless
vandalism is stupid, get over it&quot;. Excuse me, but, your
&quot;clean up&quot;, is that supposed productive? Is it supposed
to be something else than &quot;meaningless vandalism&quot;? I
think not.</strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial Baltic"><strong>If
you're going to &quot;fix&quot; a hole, then why announce it? It
will cause less trouble to the admin. The same thing would be to
walk into a bank with loaded shotguns and announce that YOU ARE
NOT ROBBING THE BANK, you are just showing how easy it might be.</strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial Baltic"><strong>If
your so r33t, why go after someone and clean their holes? Why not
do something real? Why not learn something real.</strong></font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial Baltic"><strong>Ok,
dumbass, Im done now, why dont you clean my &quot;hole&quot;.</strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial Baltic"><strong>I've
left it SOMEWHERE on this server, see if you can find it asshole.
THERE IS A BACKDOOR, you just gotta find it.</strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial Baltic"><strong>Good
luck asswipe. Why dont you get real and do something other than
Cold Fusion, why dont you try DOS, for you, its the next best
thing.</strong></font></p>
