<p>Yep another site selling cgi scripts with major security problems.
<br>CGI programmers need to spend a little time testing the security
<br>aspect of thier scripts before trying to make money with them.
<p>Greets fly to the staff's at:
<p><a href="http://packetstorm.harvard.edu/">Packet Storm Security</a>
<p><a href="http://www.hackernews.com/">Hacker News Network</a>
<p><a href="http://www.attrition.org">Attrition</a>
<p>Personal Greets fly to:
<br>v00d00. mozy, and HFX
<p>To the site admin: sorry for the hack, but your tools need alot of security
work.
