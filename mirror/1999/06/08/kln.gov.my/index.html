AntiOnline crosses the Line
6.7.99


INTRO:

John Vranesevich is the founder of AntiOnline [<a href="http://www.antionline.com">www.antionline.com</a>].
During the past five years, AO has grown from a five megabyte hobby web site, into a
multi domain business venture with hundreds of thousands of dollars in venture
capital. AntiOnline now claims to be the number one security resource on Internet. 
Despite this growth and development, AntiOnline has been under continual fire from 
critics and friends alike. Serious questions have been raised to the methods of reporting, 
staff background, journalistic integrity and business practice.

Since AntiOnline has become a commercial entity (02-22-99), the site has released 
67 pieces (some news articles, some 'specials'). Of these, 12 have been found to 
contain serious <a href="http://www.attrition.org/negation/special/../errata.html">errata</a>. So of the 'reporting' that AntiOnline 
has conducted, close to <b>20%</b> has been inaccurate.

Recently, information has come to light that suggests a far more serious agenda
exists at AntiOnline. In the past, AntiOnline had two incidents that brought them
into the spotlight, and put them on a journalistic pedestal so to speak. 

The first was centered around two teenagers in Cloverdale CA, and one adult in Israel that
was known as "Analyzer". AntiOnline got the scoop that these three (and others) were
responsible for compromising hundreds of military and government servers.
Through repeated interviews and communication, AntiOnline managed to hype up these
attacks which lead to them being described as "the most organized and systematic 
attack the Pentagon has seen to date." A short while later, it was discovered that
this threat was nothing more than a group of mostly teenagers breaking into low
security machines.(<a href="http://www1.sjmercury.com/business/center/hacker031998.htm">1</a>)

The second spotlight shone on AntiOnline after several exclusive stories and interviews
with a group calling themselves "The Masters of Downloading". AntiOnline reported
that the members of this group were responsible for compromising hundreds of
"high security" Department of Defense computer systems, and stealing
files they said were "obtained from the classified Defense Information System 
Network." Interviews between AntiOnline and the cracker said "I think international
terrorist groups would be interested in the data we could gain access to.."

Media outlets such as ZDNet unknowingly drew comparisons in the two stories. 
ZDnet said in one article(<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/content/msnb/0421/309021.html">2</a>) "The alleged hack - which follows a highly publicized
attack on Pentagon computers by an Israeli hacker known as the "Analyzer" and his
associates -- would be a major escalation of "informational warfare" on
government computers."

From all appearances, AntiOnline was single handedly responsible for a significant 
amount of the media sensationalism. Not only had AntiOnline driven the media hype
behind the stories, they put various government and DOD organizations on full
alert preparing for the fallout these attacks would cause.

There is new information coming to light suggests that AntiOnline had a more integral
part in the generation of their news. That the typical journalist/contact relationship
did not exist, and in fact, AntiOnline may have been responsible for creating some
of the news to report on.

With these recent allegations coming to light, the ATTRITION staff and several
associates set out to find out the details and foundations of the assertions.

<hr>
OUR GOAL:

To prove Masters of Downloading (MOD, headed by a hacker named so1o) was paid by 
John Vranesevich/AntiOnline to hack www.senate.gov or another high profile site in 
order for AntiOnline to break major news. To further establish that AntiOnline 
employs active and potentially malicious hackers. 


<hr>
REQUIREMENT:

To prove this, we must first prove several points.


allegation				evidence
----------				--------
so1o is on Antionline payroll		<a href="http://www.attrition.org/negation/special/proof1.html">proof.1</a> (Email)

so1o == Chris McNab 			<a href="http://www.attrition.org/negation/special/proof2.html">proof.2</a> (Email)

so1o is an MOD member 			<a href="http://www.attrition.org/negation/special/proof3.txt">proof.3</a> (Comparison of MOD/CZ hacks)
					<a href="http://www.attrition.org/negation/special/proof5.html">proof.5</a> (IRC chat with so1o)

AO reported on it first			<a href="http://www.attrition.org/negation/special/proof4.html">proof.4</a> (AntiOnline reports)

<hr>
ADDITIONAL:

On June 3rd, 1999, John Vranesevich released an editorial titled
<a href="state_of_union.txt">"State of the Union"</a>. This piece calls into question the true relationship
between Mr. Vranesevich and Chris McNab (a.k.a. so1o). The <a href="http://www.attrition.org/negation/special/proof6.html">relevant text</a>
and concern it raises, coupled with the time of this editorial and subsequent 
information presents a more damning argument.

On June 4th, 1999, John Vranesevich released a more dramatic and disturbing
editorial titled <a href="change_in_mission.txt">A Change in Our Mission</a>. To most of his readers,
this was no doubt surprising, but expected. For a smaller group of us, the timing
of this article suggests much more. On the afternoon of June 3rd, an individual
questioned Mr. Vranesevich about his ties to so1o. When challenged, 
Vranesevich begins to deny his involvement with McNab. This denial comes
after mail explicitly stating he WAS funding McNab, and after working with
McNab on an AntiOnline "exclusive" on the MOD hacks. The following
<a href="http://www.attrition.org/negation/special/proof7.html">log and comments</a> illustrate the denial and further backs our goal.

<hr>
CONCLUSION:

One would hope that high ethical standards are above the law and are in effect 
with ANY media outlet. It seems that isn't true. Not only has AntiOnline descended 
into the realm of unethical journalism and business practice, they have done it 
while thumbing their nose at the Internet. As if they can commit these practices 
with impunity, John Vranesevich taunts "Well, it would take a lot more than an act 
of congress to  get AntiOnline shut down =) I could always ship the site off 
to England ;-)  That's another good thing about the Internet. The laws of one land 
don't  hold true in them all ;-)". This was written as a reply to one comment in
the AntiOnline mailbag on 7-13-98.

As if this is not bad enough, Vranesevich has recently gone on to admit to
some of his deeds. In a "change of mission statement" released on 6.4.99,
he goes on to say "Many times, I knew about these instances before hand, and 
could have stopped them."

The information presented above is more than adequate proof that John Vranesevich 
is funding an active hacker to break into high profile sites. The motivation for this 
is to increase the awareness and therefore the profitability of his web site AntiOnline. 
He pays people to break into sites in order to report on it as an 'exclusive'.

Folks.. 1 + 1 still = 2.<br>
