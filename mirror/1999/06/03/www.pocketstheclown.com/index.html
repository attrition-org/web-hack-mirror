        size="2">government is looking for a Dutch TV- Clown,
        called 'Bassie'. The clown committed several crimes in
        Korea, Japan and the U.S. He was last seen in a plane to
        Japan, filled with nude women. The clown was also
        responsible for a big fight in Korea, two weeks ago,
        after he abused about 50 Korean girls in a cinema. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">He likes to destroy restaurants, what
        he did in Korea and in Danville, USA. The total damage is
        about $50.00. The F.B.I. is looking for him, because the
        clown and his friend, an ugly acrobat, are two
        cyber-terrorists. They hacked several computer-servers,
        but they never damaged anything during the hacks.</font> <font
        size="2">It is also beleived that 'Pockets the Clown'
        might have been a friend/lover of Bassie's, although that
        was not confirmed.</font></p>

        <font size="1">The clown they are looking for. (Picture
        by FBI)</font> <p><font size="2">The FBI and Korean
        government asks you to contact them if you ever see these
        clowns. The clown (Bassie) was last seen with red hair, a
        red nose, white make-up, and a red jacket. Don't try to
        stop this man yourself, he could be dangerous. The Dutch
        government says that it's proven that the clown can be
        very aggressive to children, and that the children who
        watched his TV-show still have some serious problems. So
        be aware of this man! The Dutch government described the
        acrobat as a strange man, who always can be found in the
        neighborhood of cheap hookers. You don't have to be
        afraid of him, the last time he was seen, he asked a nine
        years old girl to open a can of beer for him. And the
        Dutch government didnt even want to start talking about
        Pockets, the said she/he/it was unimaginably mean and
        ugly, under the make up ofcourse, but otherwise a nice
        person.</font></p>

        <font size="2">We have no idea what that means. The two

        webservers all over the world, but they still haven't
        found it. We think they will continue their search. </font></p>
