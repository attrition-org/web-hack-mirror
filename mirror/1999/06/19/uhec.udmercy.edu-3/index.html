Hey admin, the last guys here didn't pick up after themselves,
so i came and cleaned up for ya.  Your welcome.  BTW folks, if your
gonna cold fusion a server, assuming you have something important
to say (BS sure didn't, <a href="http://www.hackernews.com/orig/whoever.html">
come on guys</a>), at least patch the hole up (Although your attempt
to hide the hole was kind of amusing).  Meaningless vandalism is stupid,
get over it.<br><br>
