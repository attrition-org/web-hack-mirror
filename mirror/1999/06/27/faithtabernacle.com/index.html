<p><font color="#336699" face="Fixedsys">Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, children of all ages. I have defaced, yet another
page, to bring you in on the low-down. If only I had something to
bring to you, I'd be all set. I'm sitting here, pondering what to
write to you guys to make you think I'm cool, or elite. But do I
really want to impress you? We're on a team, and if you people
can't accept how I play this game then I do not know what to
think. I've heard people are mad because I only hit no name
sites. If you are holding a grudge against me because I am a
small-time hacker, you have problems.</font></p>

<p><font color="#336699" face="Fixedsys">But enough of that, I'm
not here to make enemies. It has been a while since I wrote my
viewers a poem.. would you like to hear one? Of course you do!</font></p>

<p><font color="#999999" face="Fixedsys">Hey diddle-diddle, the
cat and the fiddle,<br>
A cow tries to hop over a star<br>
But right about the middle, 'Cow' sticks and has to wiggle<br>
Of course it didn't get very far.<br>
So now we have you, a person named diddle-diddle,<br>
and a cat that's somewhere private, where he's making love to a
fiddle<br>
and a cow that got stuck on the star<br>
But think back to when you're a kid<br>
And all the silly things you did<br>
Now does this poem really sound that bizarre?</font></p>

<p><font color="#336699" face="Fixedsys">Okay, now that made
absolutely no sense what-so-ever, and it sucked. But, I'm out
here doing it, at least I got the balls to come and do it (I know
it's not balls, it's just plain stupidity).</font></p>

<p><font color="#336699" face="Fixedsys">I want to know where we
get these names, h4ck1ng f0r g1rl13z? h4ck1ng f0r Drunks? Ashtray
Lumberjacks? milw0rm? gLoBaL HeLL? keebler elves? (I don't have
anything against them) This just proves that we are more messed
in the head than anyone. I love being labeled psycho, because
once you're psycho, people don't find the stuff you do
irrational. Nothing is immoral, nothing in my way to stop me!</font></p>

<p><font color="#336699" face="Fixedsys">Umm.. Anyways, sorry
about that, had a splurge of psychosis there. There are still
hacker wars going on after all we've said. We need to stop them.</font></p>
