<td colspan=2 align="left"><font size=3>Insurance and registration is an important issue in the sport of gymnastics and one that 
always invokes questions from the membership. In this bulletin we put together some questions most 
frequently asked by the membership and we hope that this proves to be a useful guide. If you have any 
more questions regarding these issues please contact Gymnastics Ontario(GO) office.<p></table>
<table width=95% cellpadding=5>
<td width=50% align="left" bgcolor="beige"><b>1. What is covered under GO Master Insurance Policy?</b><p>
The GO Sports Liability Insurance Policy covers all members including coaches, officials, employees and 
volunteers while acting on behalf of The Federation. Participants are also covered while engaged in GO 
sanctioned and authorized activities. Sanctioned activities shall mean all events, competitions or sports 
demonstrations run by GO or by member Clubs as authorized by GO including related training 
at sites of events and Club premises.<p>
Sanctioned activities will include those authorized activities considered to be core to the operations of the 
vaious gymnastics disciplines governed by GO. These core areas can be classified as: Competition, Training and 
Demonstration.<p>
<td width=50% align="left">(1)<i> Competition</i><br>
A gymnastic activity is defined as a competition if one or more of the following characteristics exist:<br>
* formalized competitive requirement, format and protocol similar to the one in place for the sport, provincially, nationally and 
internationally.<br>
* the gymnast's performance is judged, scored and compared to the other participants.<br>
* the gymnasts are ranked and recognition (i.e. awards) given based on the ranking.<p>
(2)<i>Training</i><br>
Any organized and structured regimen of exercise and physical activity geared to 
enhancing a participant's skill level and overall general abilities 
towards an end (i.e. improvement competition, new skills acquisition). Certain regulations are present for training 
activities such as NCCP certification, equipment specifications and technical guidance from GO.<p>
(3)<i>Demonstration</i><br>
An organized, structured exhibition of gymnastics skills or routines intended to display the positive attributes of the sport. 
Purposes of demonstration could be to attract interest and/or increase membership for participating Clubs. showcase and promote athletes, or 
highlight gymnastics as part of a larger event or competition.<tr></table>
<table width=95% cellpadding=5 bgcolor="pink">
<td width=50% align="left"><b>2. What is not covered under GO Master Insurance Policy?</b><p>
Gymnastics Ontario's mission is to provide leadership, develop, promote and guide gymnastics as a lifetime activity and provide 
systems and programs that enable all participants to safely achieve their potential.<p>
Member clubs operate many programs and activities, most of which clearly fall within the sport of gymnastics and 
hence would be covered under The GO Master Insurance Policy. Inclusion under the Policy is directly related to 
the degree to which GO rules, regulations and risk management can be applied.<p>
Some activities incorporate gymnastics but also include other elements unrelated to GO disciplines. 
The format and operation of unrelated activities follow no known Federation technical rules or guidelines and may 
present unacceptable levels of risk exposure.<p>
<td width=50% align="left">Clubs are strongly urged to consider the operation of such programs critically and use prudent business decision-making 
processes before offering these programs.<p>
Those areas that are considered to be "non-gymnastic related" (i.e. swimming, baseball, softball, soccer, arts & crafts, toddler daycare, 
hikes and field trips, etc..) are not subject to GO rules and regulations and are not covered 
under The GO Master Insurance Policy. For example, activities such as rock climbing, skateboarding, cheerleading, Bingo's, raffles, garage sales, bake sales and 
monte carols are not covered. These activities are not considered core to The GO's programs.<p>
Please note this list is not all-inclusive and Clubs are encouraged to contact The GO for clarification on activities 
that do not fall under the Master Insurance Policy.<tr></table>

<font size=3 font color="black"><b>3. a) Are Birthday Parties covered under The GO Master Insurance Policy?</b><p>
Yes. As a new initiative and service to the clubs, for the 1999-2000 gymnastic year, Birthday Parties will be included as 
sanctioned activities under the Master GO Policy. The definition of a sanctioned gymnastic Birthday Party for non-GO Members is the 
following:<br>
<b>*</b> Gymnastic activities as per GO recreational standards and requirements with possible consumption of "party food" in a supervised environment 
within the member club facility.<br>
Birthday Parties fall under the category of demonstration as they have structure components and it is understood that a club is trying to promote its 
gymnastic programs and is trying to generate new members. Participants must be supervised at all times by a coach certified at the appropriate level 
required: minimum NCCP Level 1 Technical. GO does not require the Club to register each participant but it is recommended that the Club keep a record of who participated 
(i.e. sign sheet with name, addresses, and telephone number).<p>
<b>b) What about Day Camps, Summer Camps, PA/PD Day Camps, March Break Camps, Daycare, etc..?</b><p>
These types of activities also fall into the non-core category and are not covered under the Master Insurance Policy. The GO does provide 
an Optional Insurance Program at a discounted premium through its insurance agent for non-gymnastic activities. (please see question 4 for details).<p>
These type of program are offered by many Clubs and provide desirable services to their communities while maximizing facility time and space usage. 
They also provide needed revenue for the clubs. However activities that are not gymnastics related are often involved in 
these programs (i.e. swimming, baseball, softball, soccer, arts & crafts, toddler dancare, hikes and field trips, etc..) and 
 are not eligible as core gmnastic programs in competition, training or demonstration.<p>
<b>c) Are one day promotional gymnastic activities covered?</b><p>
Activities such as "Bring a Friend Day" are covered under GO Master Insurance Policy. They fall under the category of demonstrations as they 
have structure component and it is understood that a club is trying to promote its gymnastic programs and is trying to generate new members.<p>
As for Birthday Parties, GO does not require the Club to register each participant but it is recommended that the Club 
keep a record of who participated (i.e. sign-in sheets with name, addresses and telephone number). Any promotional activities that go beyond the "one-shot" format should, by 
definition, be considered a regular activity and participants will be required to register as individual GO Club members.

<td width=50% align="left"><b>4. Are policies available for activities not covered by The GO Master Insurance Policy?</b><p>
Yes, GO does provide member clubs an Optional Insurance Program at advantageous rates through its insurance agent, Ford-Dunn Insurance, for those activities. 
Ford-Dunn quotes details and premiums to Clubs on an individual basis for liability coverage and includes a special provision for director and officers liability insurance.<p>
The policies are available because The Federation and its member Clubs have demonstrated a record of sound Risk Management practices.<p>
Other coverage's such as travel insurance, property and equipment coverage and various types of commercial policies 
are also available to Club upon individual application.<p>
Also, The GO still offers the popular employee benefit program, through Co-Operators Insurance. Member Clubs are under no obligation to purchase insurance from The GO's 
insurer. Clubs that obtain optional liability coverage must name The GO and should name other organizations who may be involved in the Club's activities (School boards, manicipalities and landlords) as 
"<b>additional insured</b>" on the policy. 
<td width=50% align="left"><b>5. Are Volunteers covered under The GO Master Insurance Policy?</b><p>
Volunteers and the Club are covered under the liability portion of the policy but volunteers are not covered under the Sport Accident policy.<p>
<b>6. Should all members of a club be registered with GO</b><p>
It is a clear requirement that all member Clubs register <b>all</b> individual members with The GO including 
recreational gymnasts, athletes, coaches, suppert staff, judges, together with directors, executive and supporters 
who provide the full member club with volunteer help and services on a regular basis. Failure to register all members 
within the allotted time frame will be considered an act of misrepresentation and will have 
adverse effects on the Club's membership status and, more importantly, there will be <b>no</b> insurance coverage for 
unregistered persons.<tr></table>
