Groups throughout Canada.<p>
The Insurance Program is marketed in each province in conjuction with each 
Provincial Sports Federation.<p>
The foundation of the program is education on risk management based on 
many years of acturaral experience and its success is achieved by sports

Amateur Sports Insurance. Our clients include hundreds of Provincial Sports
Groups as well as many National Associations.<p>
ASIM conducts loss and risk control programs for all sports. We collect and
analyze loss statistics, case histories and guidelines to assist sport governing
bodies in reducing the exposure to their participants, volunteers and
spectators, which helps to contribute to reduced insurance cost.<p>
In addition to publishing loss control and educational bulletins we host
regular seminars for coaches, managers, participants and volunteers. These
programs are an educational and evolutional process to develop standards,
procedures, checks and evaluations which form part of a safety program with
the objective to eliminate fatalities, serious injuries and reduce other
accidents.<p>
ASIM has an associate claims handling facility with offices in major cities
throughout Canada. The claims offices are able to respond quickly to claim
situations wherever they may occur.<p>
