Admin of ISP: 
		You are not worth it to be an admin!


h2Vk defaced this ISP before (99-10-22), a part of his message:

		"Note to Admin: Let this be a warning. You cannot host web
		sites, if you do not know how to secure your box. Lucky for
		you we secured how we got in, and didn't bother deleting
		any important data, besides logs."  


My message to h2Vk:
		Do you know how to secure a box h2Vk? The box was	
		still vunerable! Why didn't you patched everything?!!!
