<U>suckz</U> they hav3 N0 talent and N0 idea but thats 0K cos i have decid3d t0 take 0ver az your new edit0r az the last       
0ne woz a queer. We ar3 hackers, we r00l this place you call your internet, we built the internet, and we can gain
access to any system connected to this
 network, it's all so easy to uz, we can br3ak g0vernment systems, we can break the US defense information systems
network, its all
 just 1's and 0's, nothing special, the thing I find funny is the fact that companies want you t0 give them money 
across the internet, using
 your personal details and your credit card information, this is also information that hackers can easily access, 
so I would stongly advise
                anyone thinking about electronic c0mmerce over the internet to think again, because...<P><BIG>security 
iz futile, and you <U>will</U> be 0wned</BIG><P><U>sh0utz 0ut
