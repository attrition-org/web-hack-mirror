Teddy Ruxpin Enthusiasts Against Tyranny (TREATY) believes in defacements.  Well, we do,
when we're sober.  Or something.  Anyway, my point is... think about what you're doing every day.  Maybe
you use a shampoo that is tested on animals?  Maybe you're too lazy to support Tibet in
their fight for freedom?  Maybe you're just a lame fuck trying to score on different
girls every single day?  Maybe you judge people on how they look?  Think before you act.  THINK BEFORE YOU ACT!
SHOW SOME FUCKING APATHY!  BYE!
