<CENTER>Since 1989, an estimated 40,000 Kashmiris have been killed by the</CENTER>

<CENTER>Indian forces stationed in Kashmir. For the last five years the
people of the</CENTER>

<CENTER>State have intensified their efforts in order to invite the attention
of the</CENTER>

<CENTER>world community towards the "Kashmir Dispute", though the people</CENTER>

<CENTER>of the State had been fighting for their just cause peacefully
for the last forty</CENTER>

<CENTER>eight years. Indian Government throughout these four decades has
been</CENTER>

<CENTER>suppressing the people by illegal use of force, putting them into
the&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>jails/Interrogation centres etc. under draconian laws. Whenever
any person demanded</CENTER>

<CENTER>holding of " Plebiscite", he has been put behind the bars.&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>
<H2>
<IMG SRC="atroc2.jpg" HEIGHT=174 WIDTH=258></H2></CENTER>

<CENTER>The Indian Forces, stationed in Kashmir, have been given a free
hand to kill any</CENTER>

<CENTER>person they choose. These powers have been given to them under
the draconian</CENTER>

<CENTER>laws like "Disturbed Areas Act of 1990" and "Indian Armed Forces
Act of 1990".</CENTER>

<CENTER>Indifference shown by world community to the miseries of people,
have</CENTER>

<CENTER>encouraged and given a free hand to armed forces, to deal with
the people, as they</CENTER>

<CENTER>like. In October 1992, the Indian Armed forces started to intensify
the killing of</CENTER>

<CENTER>people immediately after their arrest. These operations have been
carried out under</CENTER>

<CENTER>the code name of "Operation Tiger", "Operation Eagle" and "Operation
Shiva".</CENTER>

<CENTER>Now the armed forces have resorted to another policy of "Catch
and Kill" which</CENTER>

<CENTER>means that no sooner a person is taken into custody, within minutes
he is brutally</CENTER>

<CENTER>tortured and killed . The dead body is then thrown into the street.
In other cases,</CENTER>

<CENTER>innocent civilians are arrested and taken to border areas where
they are shot. The</CENTER>

<CENTER>Indian government then publicises that these people were militants
killed in armed</CENTER>

<CENTER>encounters with the troops.&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>
<H3>
<IMG SRC="kill2.jpg" HEIGHT=133 WIDTH=253></H3></CENTER>

<CENTER>It is common practice for the paramilitary forces to walk into
a quiet</CENTER>

<CENTER>village/town and start shooting indiscriminately, killing innocent
and</CENTER>

<CENTER>unarmed civilians - all under the pretence of crack-down operations</CENTER>

<CENTER>against the Freedom-Fighters. In most cases, innocent civilians
are killed,</CENTER>

<CENTER>women gang-raped and properties set on fire.</CENTER>

Deaths</A></FONT></H3></CENTER>

<CENTER>Victims in custody are treated as bodies of flesh and bones. The
punishment starts at</CENTER>

<CENTER>the time of arrest; abusive language is used and rifle-butts are
struck on their legs. In</CENTER>

<CENTER>the interrogation centres they are tortured by some methods only
unique to the Indian army.&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>&nbsp;An estimated one million women have either been bereaved,
tortured or humiliated and</CENTER>

<CENTER>beaten up or killed; many hundreds have been subjected to barbaric
sexual assaults.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Sexual harassment is used as a weapon to subvert people into submission.</CENTER>
