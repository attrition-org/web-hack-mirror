<p align="center">Since a few months Xoloth1 is missing.<br>
<br>
Xoloth1 is known for his political hacks.<br>
Specially his opinion during the Kosovo<br>
crisis made him one of&nbsp; the most loved as<br>
well as one of the most hated hackers<br>
of the century.<br>
<br>
And if it's true what we have been suspecting for the last <br>
weeks this won't be the last .CZ defacement.<br>
<br>
Being drunk isn't a reason for keeping a person<br>
in detention for all those weeks.<br>
<br>
Stop the political games, you will not win.</p>
