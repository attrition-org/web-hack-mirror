        <P> Myers Flat, elevation 196 feet, population 200, is a small but
          colorful village built at the north end of a point of land along the
          banks of the South Fork Eel River. The area was known as <I>Kunteltcobetl</I>
          by the Lolangkok tribe of the area. It was purchased by Elias and
          Andrew Myers from a pair of earlier settlers for $1000. </P>
        
        <P>The flat's humus-rich soil was tilled and tended by the Myers and
          soon boasted bountiful orchards and flower gardens. Elias' son,
          Ulysses S. Grant Myers and his wife, Mattie, eventually took over the
          property, planting 700 apple trees, 300 pear trees, sweet potatoes and
          corn. They also had hogs, chickens and dairy products. Inside the
          lobby of the Myers Country Inn, there's an 1887 scroll from the
          Mechanics Institute of San Francisco that acknowledges the ranch's
          bountiful &quot;Display of Fruitland Vegetables.&quot; </P><HR>
        
        <P><IMG SRC="images/inn.jpg" ALT="Exterior view of the Inn and its verandas." ALIGN="left" WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="132">
          It was a pretty remote outpost, but travel was beginning to increase
          through what was then known simply as &quot;Myers,&quot; and the Myers
          decided to built a hotel to serve as a resort and way station of the
          stage line. Today, that hotel is the Myers Inn. It's airy and spacious
          verandas combine with the solid &quot;blockhouse&quot; style of the
          frontier to produce an unusually-striking architecture. </P>
        
        <P><IMG SRC="images/deck.jpg" ALIGN="right" WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="255">
          When Grant died in 1937, Mattie subdivided part of the ranch and the
          stopping place grew into a more complete community. Now there are a
          gas station, grocery and several restaurants. </P>
        
        <P>The Myers family partriarchs are buried in the nearby family
          cemetery. There are some interesting stories behind the names on the
          tombstones. First of all, of course, there is Grant &quot;Pappy&quot;
          Myers. His father, Elias Myers, founder of the town, named his son
          after his personal hero. His son's real name was not &quot;Grant&quot;,
          but rather &quot;Ulysses S. Grant Myers,&quot; named after President
          and Civil War General Ulysses S. Grant. </P>
        
        <P>Grant Myers, in turn, named <I>his</I> children after <I>his</I>
          personal heroes. His son's tombstone reads &quot;Leslie R. Myers.&quot;
          But his real name wasn't &quot;Leslie;&quot; that's just the name he
          went by. His real was &quot;Lesser R. Myers,&quot; and the &quot;R&quot;
          stood for &quot;Roosevelt.&quot; His real name was &quot;Lesser
          Rosevelt Myers,&quot; named in honor of the famous American, Teddy
          Roosevelt. </P>
        
        <P>His daughter's gravestone is labeled &quot;Vada C. Jennings.&quot;
          Jennings, of course, was her married name. Her maiden name was &quot;Vada
          C. Myers.&quot; But &quot;Vada&quot; was just her nickname. She was
          named after a family friend, a woman who was in turn named after the
          state of Nevada. So her real name was &quot;Nevada C. Myers.&quot;
        </P>
        
        <P>Now, we'll give you a minute to figure out what the &quot;C&quot;
          stood for. (Hint: She was born on California Admissions Day. That's
          right, her real name was Nevada California Myers.) </P>
        
        <P>So there you have the early Myers family tree: Ulysses S. Grant
          Myers, Lesser Teddy Roosevelt Myers, and Nevada California Myers.
          There's a certain charm to it, don't you think? </P><HR>
