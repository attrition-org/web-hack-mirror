        Can a well-drafted Will avoid Probate?</strong></font>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A:</strong>
          No! All Wills must be probated to insure their validity.</font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>Q: How
          big an estate should I have before I consider a living trust?</strong></font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A:</strong>
          It is really not a matter of how much you own.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">Whether
          you are young or old, married single, have a modest or substantial
          estate, just about everyone can benefit from a Living Trust.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">As
          a matter of fact, most small estates lose a greater percentage than
          larger estate through the probate process.</font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>Q: If I
          get a Living Trust, have I finished my estate planning?</strong></font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A:</strong>
          Not necessarily.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">Depending
          on the size of your estate and your situation, you may need additional
          planning.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">There
          are several options for you to consider, and you may discuss these
          with one of our representatives with the assurance of complete
          confidentiality.</font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>Q: Does
          my Living Trust protect my assets from creditors? </strong></font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A:</strong>
          No.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">A
          Living Trust does not shield your assets from creditors.</font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>Q: If
          my home is in a Living Trust, can I still deduct mortgage interest?</strong></font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A:</strong>
          The Living Trust has no impact on income taxes.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">You
          control your assets and continue to file your income and expenses on
          your tax return, including mortgage interest.</font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>Q: Will
          having a Living Trust affect my Social Security benefits?</strong></font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A:</strong>
          Not at all, because Social Security benefits are considered income,
          and the Living Trust has no effects on income.</font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>Q: Can
          I sell my assets once they are in my Living Trust?</strong></font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A:</strong>
          Yes. You have exactly the same rights as you did prior to the creation
          of the trust.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">You
          can buy, sell, or transfer your assets at any time.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">You
          can also borrow against your as before.</font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>Q: Why
          didn&#146;t my lawyer tell me about a Living Trust?</strong></font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A:</strong>
          Many attorneys are not aware of the alternatives to probate offered by
          the Living Trust.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">Some
          simply fail to mention this to their clients as it means that the
          attorney will lose probate fee. Remember that attorneys can receive
          from 6 to 10 percent of the gross estate for probating the Will.</font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>Q: Do I
          need to notify my attorney that I replaced my Will?</strong></font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A:</strong>
          There is no need to notify your attorney.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">When
          you execute your trust, you revoke all former Wills.</font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>Q: Can
          probate be avoided by the use of joint tenancy?</strong></font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A</strong>:
          Yes and no.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">Joint
          tenancy with your spouse can delay probate, but it cannot avoid
          altogether. Upon the second death, the estate will be probated unless
          you also have joint tenancy with your heirs.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">This
          is risky, however, in that you expose your estate to any 1iabity,
          lawsuits, or creditors of any of the joint tenants.</font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>Q: Can
          Congress outlaw the Living Trust?</strong></font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A:</strong>
          Congress has little chance of ever taking away the Living Trust.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">The
          Constitution of United States of America grants certain states'
          rights.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">One
          of these states' rights is the right to create a legal entity such as
          a corporation or a trust.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">Congress
          will probably not be able to invade this area of states' rights.</font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>Q: Can
          I have a Living Trust if I am unmarried?</strong></font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A:</strong>
          Of course! If you want to avoid probate, you must have a Living Trust
          whether you are married or not.</font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>Q: Is
          the Living Trust valid in all fifty states?</strong></font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A:</strong>
          Yes, and since the Living Trust is derived from English law, it is
          recognized in all commonwealth nations and valid in most nations that
          have have a civil code.</font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>Q: What
          is an A/B Trust?</strong></font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A:</strong>
          It is a unique trust between married couples.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040">The
          trust will divide into two trusts up the first to die. Because of this
          feature, the estate tax deduction is increased from $650,000 to
          $1,300,000. It can also preserve half of the assets should there be a
          catastrophic illness or nursing home care. It is also very useful when
          there is a second marriage involved and there are two sets of
          children.</font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>Q: How
          are new assets handled after my Living Trust has been created?</strong></font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A:</strong>
          On any new purchase, simply instruct your real estate agent,
          stockbroker, or ban officer to record title to the asset in the name
          of your trust.</font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>Q: Do I
          need to change ownership of my stocks and bonds?</strong></font></p>
        
        <p><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#804040"><strong>A:</strong>
          Absolutely! All of your assets should be recorded in the name of your
          trust in order avoid probate. On any new purchase, simply instruct
          your real estate agent, stockbroker or bank officer to record title to
