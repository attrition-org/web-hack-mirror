<FONT SIZE=+1>India, a Terrorist State</FONT></H1></CENTER>

<CENTER>The massive repressive tactics of the Indian Security Forces</CENTER>

<CENTER>in the State of Punjab have drawn harsh criticism from both</CENTER>

<CENTER>inside and outside India. At one stage, the hatred</CENTER>

<CENTER>amongst the Sikh community for the Indian Government</CENTER>

<CENTER>had reached such a stage that the years old trusted</CENTER>

<CENTER>Sikh bodyguards of the then Indian P.M. Indira Gandhi</CENTER>

<CENTER>could not restrain themselves and shot her dead in her</CENTER>

<CENTER>official residence.</CENTER>

<CENTER>India has actively organized and funded a proxy civil war</CENTER>

<CENTER>in Sri-Lanka to bring the country to its heels. It is</CENTER>

<CENTER>now an open secret that Rajiv Gandhi, the ex-Premier</CENTER>

<CENTER>if India, took personal interest in the formation and</CENTER>

<CENTER>activities of the terrorist outfit LTTE in northern</CENTER>

<CENTER>Sri-Lanka. He used LTTE to blackmail Sri-Lanka in order</CENTER>

<CENTER>to bring its foreign policy in-line with that of India.</CENTER>

<CENTER>The violence that followed has destroyed Sri-Lanka's</CENTER>

<CENTER>tourism based economy and caused a lot of bloodshed.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Hatred against such activities was obvious when</CENTER>

<CENTER>Rajiv Gandhi got beaten with a stick by a Sri-Lankan</CENTER>

<CENTER>Guard, when the Indian Premier was taking a Guard</CENTER>

<CENTER>of "Honor" while on a "good-will visit" to that</CENTER>

<CENTER>country. This happened in front of cameras for the rest</CENTER>

<CENTER>of the world to see. The havoc brought forward by</CENTER>

<CENTER>terrorism in Sri-Lanka eventually resulted by the</CENTER>

<CENTER>death of Rajiv Gandhi in a suicide bomb attack, by the</CENTER>

<CENTER>same LTTE he formed and funded but later withdrew</CENTER>

<CENTER>support from, once his objectives had changed.</CENTER>

<CENTER>These facts clearly portray that both sides in the</CENTER>

<CENTER>current Sri-Lankan conflict are aware of and detest the</CENTER>

<CENTER>role of India in fomenting trouble in their erstwhile</CENTER>

<CENTER>peaceful country.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Even now, India is actively engaged in terrorist ventures</CENTER>

<CENTER>in neighboring Pakistan where there are bombs being</CENTER>

<CENTER>exploded every now and then. Also another novelty</CENTER>

<CENTER>of RAW's modus operandi is the sniper phenomenon,</CENTER>

<CENTER>where RAW agents appear randomly in the streets of</CENTER>

<CENTER>Karachi and fire indiscriminately at innocent</CENTER>

<CENTER>civilians. No cause can be attributed to such senseless</CENTER>

<CENTER>acts, only that in private Indians claim that such acts</CENTER>

<CENTER>are a "tit-for-tat" for Pakistan's "involvement" in</CENTER>

<CENTER>Kashmir.</CENTER>

<CENTER>India's dismal record in upholding the human rights</CENTER>

<CENTER>of its minorities is not limited to Eastern Punjab and the</CENTER>

<CENTER>Occupied Kashmir alone. Its brutal massacres of the</CENTER>

<CENTER>members of its Naga minority is yet another example of</CENTER>

<CENTER>India's utter disregard for the value of human rights of</CENTER>

<CENTER>its minorities. The destruction of Babri Mosque</CENTER>

<CENTER>in Ayodhya by Hindu fanatics, was openly</CENTER>

<CENTER>supported by the fundamentalist Hindu</CENTER>

<CENTER>Government, which forcibly stopped the local Muslims</CENTER>

<CENTER>from going and saving one of their most holy and ancient</CENTER>

<CENTER>places of worship. The police openly helped Hindu fanatics</CENTER>

<CENTER>tear the historic mosque down. This was followed by</CENTER>

<CENTER>bloody riots in Bombay, where the local police</CENTER>

<CENTER>watched mobs of hateful Hindu zealouts slay Muslims</CENTER>

<CENTER>to their deaths. Even women and children were not</CENTER>

<CENTER>spared. An inquiry was forced to be opened as to</CENTER>

<CENTER>ascertain the partisan behavior of local administration</CENTER>

<CENTER>but was killed by the Hindu extremist government as being</CENTER>

<CENTER>'unnecessary'. Later the fundamentalist government</CENTER>

<CENTER>accused local Muslims for the carnage and started</CENTER>

<CENTER>expelling them without mercy from their homes in and</CENTER>

<CENTER>around Bombay.</CENTER>

<CENTER><B>Such is the true face of "secular" India.</B></CENTER>
