<h1>
<font SIZE="+1">Kashmiris are NOT Terrorists</font></h1></center>

<center>Cornered by the extensive reports of abuses of Human</center>

<center>Rights by the Indian security personnel, Indian</center>

<center>government changed tactics and countered the</center>

<center>international pressure by posing itself as an underdog</center>

<center>of the crisis. According to their new propaganda,</center>

<center>Kashmiris were a part of a mythical grandiose Islamic</center>

<center>terrorist movement directed at the rest of the world,</center>

<center>andIndia was one of its targets.</center>

<center>Many people would avoid the debate over terrorism by</center>

<center>simply stating that one man's terrorist is another</center>

<center>man's freedom fighter. However Kashmiris and their</center>

<center>supporters believe that the terrorizing of innocent</center>

<center>civilians to achieve a certain motive, whether justified</center>

<center>ornot, is unacceptable. This is evident from the behavior</center>

<center>of the Kashmiri freedom fighters and their supporters.</center>

<center>Analyzing the situation in Kashmir, it is soon realized</center>

<center>that there has not been a SINGLE act of terrorism by</center>

<center>the liberation movement directed against innocent</center>

<center>civilians, even as alleged by the Indian Government, in</center>

<center>the 50-year history of Kashmir's occupation. The</center>

<center>movement has strictly been localized with people</center>

<center>resisting the occupation forces in their own land.</center>

<center>There have been no attacks in the rest of Indian states</center>

<center>by the liberation movement, in order to force India off</center>

<center>Kashmir. It must be appreciated here that the</center>

<center>Kashmiri freedom fighters have had the chance but</center>

<center>have restrained themselves from indulging in terrorist</center>

<center>ventures in the rest of India in order to force them off</center>

<center>their land. In fact, the only acts of terrorism have been</center>

<center>those of the Indian Army, against innocent civilians,</center>

<center>which are well documented in the reports of Amnesty</center>

<center>International, Asia Watch and other international</center>

<center>HROs. What we see is the purest form of</center>

<center>state-terrorism, whereby a military power is seeking to</center>

<center>consolidate its hold on a foreign land through massive</center>

<center>suppression of the local population. Such acts of</center>

<center>brutality, as is obvious from the reports of&nbsp; Human Rights</center>

<center>Commissions around the world, find no parallel in</center>

<center>modern history. The immense restraint shown by the</center>

<center>Kashmiris in their methods of fighting for freedom led the</center>

<center>Indian Government to desperation. Its main intelligence&nbsp;</center>

<center>outfit RAW, executed a fake hijacking of an Indian Airliner</center>

<center>to Lahore in 1971, purportedly on behalf of the Kashmiris.</center>

<center>The aim was to give a terrorist dimension to a highly</center>

<center>defensive nature of Kashmiri national movement that at</center>

<center>that time was not even violent. It was quite</center>

<center>fortunate that soon the secret of RAW's involvement</center>

<center>was out. Incidentally, it was RAW which throughout</center>

<center>the Afghan War, masterminded the planning</center>

<center>and execution of the terrorist activities on</center>

<center>Pakistani soil. The purpose was to deter Pakistan from</center>

<center>its principled support of Afghan liberation movement</center>

<center>against India's ally, the ex-Soviet Union. The help</center>

<center>and finances given to RAW by the KGB, enabled India to</center>

<center>arrange hundreds of destructive bomb blasts in</center>

<center>Pakistani civilian centers throughout the Afghan War.</center>

<center>With the defeat of the Soviet Union such terrorist</center>

<center>activities by RAW did not finish in Pakistan. Such</center>

<center>activities continue to this day in order to, again, keep</center>

<center>Pakistan off balance. These terrorist activities of RAW</center>

<center>have been well reported in the international press,</center>

<center>especially during the Afghan War.</center>
