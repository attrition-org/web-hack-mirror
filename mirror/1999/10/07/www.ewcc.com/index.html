<center>
<h1>
<font SIZE="+1">An ally to the United States and a Source of Stability in
the region</font></h1></center>

<center>Pakistan, by the very nature of its independence in 1947,</center>

<center>attaches great importance to freedom and equality. It is</center>

<center>not surprising that Pakistan and the West turned out to</center>

<center>be natural allies in their quest for a free world, from</center>

<center>the very beginning of cold war. The relationship</center>

<center>blossomed from the very start and Pakistan soon</center>

<center>became &quot;the most allied of allies&quot; with the free world.</center>

<center>The common perception of the world problems often led</center>

<center>the West and Pakistan to such common platforms as</center>

<center>CENTO and SEATO. Such an alliance promoted stability in</center>

<center>the region. In 1979, things were shaken when the Red</center>

<center>Russians rolled into Afghanistan. The historic</center>

<center>Afghan resistance and the Pak-American alliances once</center>

<center>again ensured that the cause of freedom and dignity</center>

<center>was upheld. The defeat of the Soviet Union eventually</center>

<center>led to its downfall and the opening of Pandora's box and</center>

<center>many other suppressed nations found their way to</center>

<center>freedom. Kashmiris seek inspiration from this defeat</center>

<center>and expulsion of a superpower from an alien land, when</center>

<center>they hope to expel the Indian occupation forces from</center>

<center>their own land.</center>

<center>Pakistan had also furthered the cause of global peace by</center>

<center>promoting talks between U.S. and Iran to reduce</center>

<center>tensions, a fact reminiscent of the famous visit of Henry</center>

<center>Kissinger to China. That mediation by Pakistan led</center>

<center>the U.S. and China from being adversaries to</center>

<center>becoming healthy trading partners and did a lot to</center>

<center>further the cause of peace and stability in the world. In</center>

<center>the relatively unstable politics of the post-Soviet</center>

<center>era, Pakistan has continued to play its constructive role</center>

<center>in the world. In 1990, Pakistan was one of the</center>

<center>allies responsible for driving the Iraqis out of Kuwait.</center>

<center>Further contributions to world peace were made when Pakistan</center>

<center>sent one of the largest peace keeping missions to Somalia</center>

<center>and then to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and maintained them there in</center>

<center>face of an increasingly hostile atmosphere.</center>

<center>With democracy firmly rooted and a pro-industry</center>

<center>Government in office, Pakistan stands poised to</center>

<center>enter the 21st century with all the confidence and drive</center>

<center>of a modern nation. Investment is booming and the coming</center>

<center>together of Central Asian Republics, Pakistan, Turkey and</center>

<center>Iran in the Economic Co-operation Organization as a powerful</center>

<center>trade block holds further promise of vast investment</center>

<center>opportunities.</center>

<center>Pakistan's principled moral and diplomatic support to</center>

<center>the Kashmiris is a result of its time-tested belief in</center>

<center>freedom, human rights and equality. Pakistan's efforts</center>

<center>to finding peaceful solutions to the Kashmir problem,</center>

<center>Nuclear non-proliferation and other regional problems have</center>

<center>continually been frustrated by India's refusal to</center>

<center>co-operate. India's Security Forces have terrorized a</center>

<center>freedom-loving people and made them hostages in their</center>

<center>own land. It is the responsibility of freedom-loving</center>

<center>elements of the world to uphold the dignity and value of</center>

<center>human life. The free world, like in the past must use its</center>

<center>influence to force India to honor the wishes of Kashmiri</center>

<center>people, stop abusing their human rights and honor the pledge</center>

<center>given to them and rest of the world regarding their right to</center>

<center>self-determination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</center>
