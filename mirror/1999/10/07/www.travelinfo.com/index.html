<font SIZE="+1">For UN to stay relevant</font></h1></center>

<center>Where is the international framework of rights and</center>

<center>justice? Is the UN dead, and its charter buried? The</center>

<center>people of Kashmir have long been promised the chance</center>

<center>to decide their destiny but now the UN is silent and the</center>

<center>US says that &quot;East Timor is not Kosovo __ nor is</center>

<center>Kashmir another East Timor.'' This is in explanation of</center>

<center>why US interest in the Kashmir crisis is limited to</center>

<center>forcing Pakistan into submitting itself to the Indian</center>

<center>hegemony and in Timor to &quot;humanitarian concerns and</center>

<center>strategically located sea-lanes.&quot;&nbsp;</center>

<center>The US, however, is mistaken. The reason the world</center>

<center>has a problem with East Timor and Kashmir is that</center>

<center>they are other Kosovos but in different part of the world.</center>

<center>Timor did not begin that way, but that is what it has</center>

<center>become. Whereas Kashmir has actually begun that</center>

<center>way. All the western governments have trouble</center>

<center>explaining why they cannot do anything effective about</center>

<center>India's conduct in Kashmir. Where are their incautious</center>

<center>announcements about the arrival of a new age of</center>

<center>&quot;humanitarian wars'' for doing justice? Where are their</center>

<center>unguarded forecasts about the significance of NATO's</center>

<center>victory over Serbian ethnic cleansing in Kosovo?&nbsp;</center>

<center>President Bill Clinton announced that beleaguered</center>

<center>minorities everywhere in the world no longer had to fear</center>

<center>Kosovo-style ethnic cleansing. He said the</center>

<center>&quot;international community&quot; would protect them. Many</center>

<center>argued that a new humanitarian internationalism had</center>

<center>been created, which in the future could stop and punish</center>

<center>ethnic cleansing, mass deportations, state terrorism</center>

<center>and war crimes. The age of sovereign nations would</center>

<center>yield to an international sovereignty. Clinton informed</center>

<center>&quot;the people of the world'' that a new era had dawned.</center>

<center>&quot;Whether you live in Africa, or Central Europe, or any</center>

<center>other place, if somebody comes after innocent civilians</center>

<center>and tries to kill them en masse because of their race,</center>

<center>their ethnic background or their religion, and it's within</center>

<center>our power to stop it, we will stop it,'' he said.&nbsp;</center>

<center>The Kashmiris are experiencing a new kind of apathy</center>

<center>from the so-called international community which</center>

<center>forces them to think if they should forget about their</center>

<center>rights in the new world order and wait for deliverance</center>

<center>from India's fascism till the day when their valley would</center>

<center>become as important to Eurocentric NATO as Kosovo.</center>

<center>For a fair deal, should they now depend on the</center>

<center>compulsions of the states of India and Pakistan, and</center>

<center>the narrowly defined interests of the powerful</center>

<center>international community, rather than an international</center>

<center>framework of rights and justice? Given the historical</center>

<center>baggage and hostilities, it is useless to expect that</center>

<center>Pakistan and India would sort it out between</center>

<center>themselves.&nbsp;</center>

<center>It is extremely surprising that the leading powers are so</center>

<center>willingly accepting India's weak position on the issue in</center>

<center>terms of international law. The fact is that Kosovo is</center>

<center>still recognised as a part of sovereign Yugoslavia</center>

<center>whereas Kashmir is a UN-recognised disputed territory</center>

<center>awaiting a just and final settlement. By exhorting</center>

<center>Pakistan and India to treat an unjust and unresolved</center>

<center>UN cease-fire line as if it was as inviolable as divine</center>

<center>revelation, and approaching the precarious situation in</center>

<center>Kargil as an isolated instance of such unthinkable</center>

<center>violation, the so-called international community and the</center>

<center>UN have only eroded their credibility. Surely, the</center>

<center>present-day upholders of human rights and values of</center>

<center>justice and democracy should be able to look beyond</center>

<center>the line.&nbsp;</center>

<center>The champions of human rights, who were propelled</center>

<center>into action because of ethnic cleansing of the</center>

<center>Kosovars, have chosen to disregard the even more</center>

<center>serious repression in Kashmir. They have chosen to</center>

<center>disregard the ever-increasing number of Indian troops</center>

<center>that enforce Indian control through terror, torture, rape</center>

<center>and murder. The US, its allies and the UN are</center>

<center>accomplices in Indian genocide for they are doing little</center>

<center>more than parroting the Indian refrain, and disregarding</center>

<center>the unpardonable crimes of India against innocent</center>

<center>communities in the valley. It was everybody's business</center>

<center>when the Serb forces did these things in Kosovo on a</center>

<center>much smaller time and human loss scale. The Kashmir</center>

<center>issue urgently requires a just settlement that could</center>

<center>only be brought about with the involvement of the UN.</center>

<center>Peace in Kashmir and hence the region could only be</center>

<center>achieved if the process starts with putting the people of</center>

<center>Kashmir before any strategic, commercial or political</center>

<center>advantage of the powerful international club or Pakistan</center>

<center>or India. At the moment, it seems that the UN has no</center>

<center>power of its own. And this fact has had lethal</center>

<center>consequences in Kashmir, when combined with the</center>

<center>UN's promise that its people could become</center>

<center>independent if they so chose. The Security Council</center>

<center>thus far has declined to support the promise made in</center>

<center>its name.&nbsp;</center>

<center>Nothing short of the credible threat of a Kosovo-like</center>

<center>military intervention, combined with international</center>

<center>economic and political reprisals against India, seems</center>

<center>likely to end the crisis. If we agree with the western</center>

<center>propaganda, such as published in the Washington</center>

<center>Post, that &quot;no solution can be achieved under the</center>

<center>threat of military action,&quot; the question arises that what</center>

<center>were then the US and its allies trying to achieve</center>

<center>through bombing Yugoslavia for more than two months</center>

<center>in a row?&nbsp;</center>

<center>The Indian campaign to terrorise supporters of</center>

<center>independence and cleanse Kashmir of its Muslim</center>

<center>population approaches a successful conclusion. It has</center>

<center>to be reversed. The Indian defiance and mockery of the</center>

<center>UN is intolerable and destabilising. The UN has to act,</center>

<center>as it is no more than what its members make of it, but</center>

<center>its existence and action are indispensable to a</center>

<center>minimally civilised international order. If its members</center>

<center>expect any progress toward a new and muscular</center>

<center>humanitarianism, they must back the world</center>

<center>organisation against those who flagrantly defy it. A line</center>

<center>has to be drawn, and in Kashmir, the Indians</center>

<center>themselves have drawn it.&nbsp;</center>

<center>On the other hand, the western press is encouraging</center>

<center>UN's inaction by treating the Kashmir crisis as an</center>

<center>unimportant case than others around the world.</center>

<center>According to the Washington Post, for example, &quot;if the</center>

<center>world powers, having staked their prestige on</center>

<center>self-determination for East Timor, can so easily allow</center>

<center>their will to be flouted, the 'security and strategic</center>

<center>consequences' will be immense, and they will resonate</center>

<center>far beyond Indonesia,&quot; but no such views are</center>

<center>expressed about Kashmir where the situation is more</center>

<center>volatile than East Timor. The Post instead sides with</center>

<center>India and writes that it &quot;is rightly demanding that</center>

<center>Pakistan help in removing the guerrillas as the first step</center>

<center>toward defusing the current crisis&quot; and that &quot;India has</center>

<center>so far shown commendable restraint.&quot;&nbsp;</center>

<center>With more than half a million soldiers in Kashmir, it is</center>

<center>wrong to assume that India is exercising restraint.</center>

<center>However, the UN and US should accept that Kashmir</center>

<center>issue can never be settled in a cul-de-sac. It shall be</center>

<center>settled either through force or through international</center>

<center>intervention and pressure __ the possibility of the latter</center>

<center>is apparently remote, although efforts should continue</center>

<center>in this direction. But nothing can be achieved solely</center>

<center>through bilateral negotiations, bypassing the people of</center>

<center>Kashmir and ignoring their wishes and sentiments.</center>

<center>India would not be prepared, it seems, for any kind of</center>

<center>talks unless it is under real pressure from the people</center>

<center>and the freedom fighters.&nbsp;</center>

<center>The British daily Financial Times in its issue of May 28,</center>

<center>1999 writes under the heading &quot;War in Kashmir&quot;: &quot;The</center>

<center>nuclear dimension means the outside world has much</center>

<center>at stake too. India has always sought to avoid</center>

<center>internationalisation of the conflict but the world has a</center>

<center>common interest in keeping it in check. This is</center>

<center>precisely the kind of problem for what the multilateral</center>

<center>approach of a strong UN is needed.&quot; And that needs</center>

<center>approval from Washington, which may not come until</center>

<center>we face a nuclear holocaust on the sub-continent.&nbsp;</center>

<center>The Independent in its editorial of May 29, 1999, after</center>

<center>mentioning the UN intervention in Kosovo and Iraq, its</center>

<center>peace-keeping efforts and the accountability of crimes</center>

<center>against humanity, wrote: &quot;And this is a doctrine that</center>

<center>could be applied to the Kashmir conflict, which was</center>

<center>never a simple border dispute between the UN member</center>

<center>states, or even an argument about to which of them a</center>

<center>province belonged.... The UN has some standing in</center>

<center>Kashmir, too, as the guarantor of the referendum once</center>

<center>promised by the Indian government......... In the case of</center>

<center>Kashmir, however, the UN is probably the only hope of</center>

<center>peaceful resolution.&quot; This is why the UN has to prove</center>

<center>that it means to do more than just looking after the</center>

<center>interests of the powerful. It has to act alone on the</center>

<center>issue of Kashmir if not allowed by Washington.&nbsp;</center>

<center>India has all along opposed the deployment of UN</center>

<center>peace force and the monitoring of LoC by UN</center>

<center>representatives, and this is a clear proof of India's mala</center>

<center>fide. India's case on Kargil is flimsy and full of</center>

<center>contradictions. But here again Pakistan has failed to</center>

<center>bring round the world opinion. Woe to the</center>

<center>self-appointed custodians of international morality who</center>

<center>are looking the other way at this premeditated</center>

<center>massacre as if the Kashmiri blood is less sacrosanct</center>

<center>than the blood of the Kosovars and inhabitants of East</center>

<center>Timor. This callousness has already convinced the</center>

<center>bruised people in Kashmir that they are victim of the</center>

<center>UN, US and its allies' double standards of human rights</center>

<center>and morality and that the aphorism that 'might is right'</center>

<center>is as relevant in the game of power in the closing</center>

<center>stages of the twentieth century as it was in the Gothic</center>

<center>ages.&nbsp;</center>

<center>The continuing crisis in Kashmir is provoking calls for</center>

<center>UN action. But with the UN unwilling to intervene</center>

<center>without the American and Indian permission there is</center>

<center>little leverage left to stop Indian occupation and</center>

<center>oppression in the occupied Kashmir. During the period</center>

<center>of struggle, 70,000 hapless Kashmiri freedom fighters</center>

<center>have been gunned down and thousands are facing the</center>

<center>same fate. The sole crime of the victims is that they</center>

<center>demanded their inalienable right to self-determination to</center>

<center>decide their future through a UN-supervised plebiscite</center>

<center>promised to them by the United Nations as well as by</center>

<center>India and Pakistan. But where is the UN?&nbsp;</center>
