<p align="center">Nemesystm is back with a site change for the DHC.</p>
<p align="center">To L7: You know, you're absolutely right. Everytime I hack,
err. &quot;change&quot; a website, I'll call it changing when it's with the
Frontpage exploit. I'm still young (so young, you wouldn't believe me if I told
you), that means I'm still learning a lot. I started changing websites, coz
something ticked me off, I'm just working off the lists of sites I made that are
vulnerable, I'm now working off my Frontpage Extensions list, if this annoys
anybody, sorry. (Yes I take some sites I see along the way too) For the rest I'd
like to say, that eventually the sites will become of a higher profile, although
I think <a href="http://www.globalpac.com">globalpac.com</a> and <a href="http://www.bblconsulting.com">bblconsulting.com</a>
are pretty high profile already, and the exploits used will become more and more
uncommon. I hope I'll be able to say someday that I'm as good as you guys, but
until then, I'll be changing them Frontpage sites as much as I want
too.:-)&nbsp; I mean even the PHC does it once in a while (<a href="http://www.americanautotraders.com">www.americanautotraders.com</a>
I think for example)</p>
<p align="center">Now for the rest of the people:&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">I have many friends, and &quot;many'er&quot; foes. But as the
changed site list grows, security knows, stopping me now is kinda serious.</p>
<p align="center">Great minds talk about ideas. Average minds talk about events.
Simple minds talk about people. (thanks C.)</p>
