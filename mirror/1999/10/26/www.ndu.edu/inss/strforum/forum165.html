<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Conclusions</font></b><font SIZE="3"></p>

<ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The European Monetary Union (EMU) will affect the
    economic balance of forces between the European Union and the United States.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The introduction of the euro as the currency of
    the EMU will aid participating European Union (EU) member states by eliminating
    transaction costs, exchange rate risks, and interest rate spreads across the 11 European
    currencies early in the coming century.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The proportion of international transactions and
    assets held, in euros, could approximate that held in dollars within 10 years.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The U.S.-European political relationship is
    increasingly disconnected due to the lack of a common external threat, with the United
    States being concerned about threats to global security and European states focusing on
    the EMU and unemployment problems.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">U.S.-European relations are going through a period
of fundamental readjustment. In the economic and financial arena, the introduction of the
European Monetary Union (EMU) creates the conditions for a truly supranational European
identity and, ultimately, a change in the economic balance of forces between the European
Union (EU) and the United States. In the political arena, the U.S.-European political
relationship is becoming increasingly disconnected. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The introduction of the euro, as the currency of the
EU, is an event of historic importance for European economic integration and for the
worldwide financial system. With the implementation of the first stage of this economic
union last January, the EMU is transforming the world of business, commerce, and finance.
Conversion rates of the 11-country national currencies have been irrevocably fixed, and
the euro is trading in foreign exchange and money markets; the European Central Bank has
started to operate; new financial instruments, including bank accounts, are issued in
euros; and accounting, retail pricing, and business invoices in euros are used in parallel
with national currencies. Euro notes and coins are being produced for circulation in 2002,
when they will replace national currencies. By July 1, 2002, the euro will be the only
form of legal tender in participating member states. With economic integration thus
expanded, Europe's experiment with a supranational union is moving into a new phase. The
relationship of the EU with the United States is likely to change, as Europe's growing
financial, commercial, and economic clout affects the distribution of resources on a
global scale.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The Effect of the EMU on the European Identity</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The significance of the EMU in forging a more
dynamic European identity should be evaluated in terms of its impact on the international
economic system. The economic space of the EU involves 300 million inhabitants and
commands a gross domestic product (GDP) larger than the United States&#146; even though it
has yet to match America in terms of per capita income. Internationally, the EU is the
world's largest trading partner, but nearly two-thirds of international transactions
involve the U.S. dollar. The EMU will alter these relationships.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">For a number of reasons, the advent of the EMU
implies an erosion of the dominance of the U.S. dollar in international trade and finance;
the euro's importance will eventually match that of the dollar. By replacing 11 European
currencies, the euro will become a key international reserve currency. More significantly,
the absence of transaction costs, exchange rate risks, and interest rate spreads across
the EU can stimulate the development of a truly integrated financial market in the whole
range of financial instruments and activities, including securities trading, pension
funds, retail banking, and insurance. According to estimates prepared for the European
Commission, within 10 years the proportion of international transactions carried out in
euros and assets held in euros will approximate the amount currently held in dollars.
Portfolio shifts will also take place as the supply of financial assets in euros continues
to grow. Non-EU countries will be affected by the euro, most directly via international
trade relations. Trade is expected to increase gradually but steadily as a result of
economic growth following completion of the EMU. Indirect effects may be even more
profound and global because the euro will serve as a vehicle currency (one that
facilitates financial transactions) in foreign exchange markets, and as an invoicing
currency (one that facilitates billing) in international trade, with a growing role in
capital markets.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The Trade and Investment Relationship</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The importance of the trade and investment
relationship between the United States and the EU is likely to grow in the new tripolar
international financial environment dominated by the U.S. dollar, the European euro, and,
to a lesser extent, the Japanese yen. The ascent of the euro as a key currency in the
conduct of international transactions will make it more difficult for the United States to
run large external deficits financed by the issue of dollars, since there would be less
demand for them. Correspondingly, the EMU would find it easier to run external deficits
without a depreciating currency. In practice, the EU would likely run smaller trade
surpluses as the United States reduced its trade deficit. As a consequence, there will be
increased pressure for fiscal policy coordination among European countries. By the same
token, the United States and the EU will need to develop cooperation between the Federal
Reserve and the European Central Bank in monetary policy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">These developments are likely to lead to realignment
of economic priorities and may necessitate change in policy choices. A successful
transition to a single currency will reward the efforts of EU member states toward
economic convergence but it does not address the critical problem of unemployment in
Europe which has remained unacceptably high throughout the l990s. The choice of pursuing a
looser monetary policy and a weaker euro cannot be ruled out now that center-left
governments are the norm in the EU; in fact, this may become the policy of choice. Under
appropriate conditions, a weak euro would promote higher growth and lower unemployment; in
this case, a weak euro would pose an even stronger challenge to the dollar to the extent
that it would enhance the utilization of resources in Europe's economy.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Strong versus Weak Euros</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">There are some indications that the EU is
considering a more lenient interpretation of the inflation criterion in assessing future
EMU membership. Such a move may be necessary, because the challenge facing all EU member
states is not one of price stability; it is the poor record of most EU economies in
creating jobs and reducing unemployment. If these concerns are shared by the European
Central Bank and incorporated in its euro-dollar exchange rate policy, they could help
promote a weaker euro and ultimately reduce unemployment rates. However, a weaker euro,
that would further improve Europe's trade position, would give rise to stronger calls for
protectionism in the United States. Such developments might represent something greater
than simple inconvenience and could force a change in America's domestic economic policy
priorities; measures to reduce the trade deficit would require continuing fiscal
discipline and budgetary restraint.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">For the United States, success of the euro is
important because it will help modernize and strengthen the economy of Europe which
remains America's most important trading partner. At the same time, the euro's success
will require long-term adjustments. The ability of the United States to sustain its large
trade deficit position will be constrained by reduced financial inflows, and measures to
offset inflationary pressures might ultimately become necessary. The greater the success
of the euro, the more certain it is that U.S. financial supremacy will be challenged and
its economic policy reoriented accordingly.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Thus, Europe's transformation into a truly unified
economic space will inevitably lead to a change in the EU-U.S. relationship in the 21st
century. Economic transformation has security dimensions. If EMU is a prelude to European
political unification and paves the way for the creation of a truly supranational European
identity, it can lead to realignment in the distribution of power in the international
system as a whole. The resulting changes, which will be gradual and incremental but also
inevitable, can influence international security relationships.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">A Divergent Political Relationship</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The development of the EU as a truly unified
economic space is occurring even as the U.S.-European political relationship is becoming
increasingly disconnected. The dissolution of the USSR ended a period in which a massive
and immediate threat to the common interests of the United States and Western Europe
forged an enduring bond. Although tensions between the United States and Europe existed,
the necessity of their security relationship could not be challenged. NATO was the
instrument of the U.S. role in Europe and the only real instrument of European security.
The European Community was an economic organization with a political but not a security
dimension.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The situation is dramatically different today, for
several reasons. First, NATO is now an optional alliance. It provides insurance against a
resurgence of the Russian threat and against new but ill-defined future threats of a
lesser scale. For this reason, America has supported NATO enlargement and a new strategic
concept emphasizing common Western interests, rather than territorial defense, as a
primary NATO function. This has been based as much on an American desire to remain a
European power as a response to genuine outside threats. It has been aimed at a domestic
audience as well, for internationalists fear isolationist feelings lurking in the American
people. Second, the discipline of bipolarity imposed by Cold War has eroded. As the Cold
War recedes, historical fault lines reappear along with rancorous partisan politics in
some nations. The presidential impeachment process exemplified this trend in the United
States and in Russia. Third, the EU assumed a security and defense identity at Maastricht
in 1991 and European cooperation on foreign, security, and defense cooperation is greater
than before.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><b>Intra-European Focus.</b> There are currently two
great disconnects in U.S.-European relations&#151;Europe's preoccupation with
intra-European affairs and its concurrent desire to control its own destiny. The first
disconnect is that the United States wants Europe to do more on global security but Europe
is generally reluctant. There has been a civilianization of much of European society, an
allergy to the use of force as an instrument of foreign policy, especially notable in
Germany and in the North. Europe is inward-looking, its plate full of grave and weighty
concerns. The EMU, the greatest European initiative in decades, has required years of
discipline, commitment, and sacrifice and cannot be allowed to go awry. Unemployment has
become the big problem of Europe. Failure to resolve it has led to the defeat of ruling
parties and their leaders. But the victors know that the clock is ticking and that it is
not far from the capitol to the Tarpeian rock. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">There is an increasing willingness to attempt to
deal with the politics of unemployment and economic growth on a European level. Indeed, it
is likely that the European solution will involve a more centrally inspired EU
intervention rather than an American-style free market approach. The rise of extremist and
fascist parties, like the French National Front, has resulted mostly from the failure of
governments to deal with the politics as well as the economics of unemployment. Then there
is the crisis of the welfare state, which no one wants to tackle head on.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Still, something far more profound is also
occurring. For hundreds of years, the essence of West European history has been the rise
of nation states and their eventual democratization. But history is on the move again.
Economic integration is evolving in a climate of political devolution. The nation state is
caught between loss of power from above&#151;first to NATO and then to the EU&#151;and now
from below&#151;to assertive regional and subnational loyalties. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">We cannot assume that even states in Europe and
elsewhere which have seemed firm and eternal will continue to exist as we have known them.
Canada, as the Quebec elections indicate, could dissolve. In Italy, federalist and even
separatist feelings are palpable in the North, and a new constitution still needs to be
written. In Spain, the political system may need to be revised to increase the already
considerable powers of the Basque and Catalan governments. In Belgium, the power of the
regions is already great, and the central government is more and more shadowy. Finally, in
the UK, Prime Minister Tony Blair has undertaken risky and fundamental changes of the
unwritten constitution and has begun the process of devolution in Scotland and Wales. This
has already led to a separate regional parliament for each, and there is a real potential
for Scottish independence. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">At the same time, even though EU enlargement is
unavoidable (and the EU is officially committed to it), the EU is displaying great
reluctance and hesitation; therefore, the process is delayed. Enlargement requires
renegotiation of the basic institutional structure of the EU and its finances, which
strains the political will of member states. If we admit that all politics is local
politics, we can understand why Europe is preoccupied with these issues and, therefore,
reluctant to shoulder more responsibilities elsewhere, as the United States would like.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><b>Security Responsibility versus Security Burden.</b>
The second disconnect, which is often perceived to be in contradiction with the first, is
that Europe wants greater control over its own destiny. It is tired of being an economic
giant but a political dwarf. To the American thesis that European security is best treated
in the Atlantic framework, with NATO as the main instrument and the United States as the
leader, there exists a rival thesis of a European Europe&#151;that the EU should take more
responsibility through its own security and defense identity. The proponent of that
thesis, not surprisingly, is France. Alone of the old nation states of Europe, France did
not accept its demise as a global player. Recognizing the limited capacities of a
mid-sized state, it transposed its ambitions to the EU. The EU was seen as a France writ
large.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The French ambition is plausible but suffers from
two defects. First, in general, Europeans still want the United States around. Second,
Europe is not anxious to assume the greater burden and responsibility this thesis implies.
The result will be continuing European ambivalence between the American and French points
of view, usually manifesting itself over specific crises, such as policy toward Iraq and
the use of unilateral sanctions. Therefore, tensions between the United States and Europe,
and more particularly between the United States and France, will continue.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In conclusion, we can anticipate a difficult period
of transition marked by serious tensions in U.S.-European relations. It may be tempting to
interpret the successful termination of the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia as a sign
that strong common interests prevail; that the transatlantic relationship between the
United States and Europe reflects solidarity, consensus, and a single world view; and that
the future of U.S.-European relations rests firmly on the shared heritage of global market
economics and liberal democratic politics. Yet achievement of NATO&#146;s stated aims will
still mean that the United States and Europe will have to face and solve the complex and
costly problems of a regional settlement, to include rebuilding of Yugoslavia. Europeans
may decide to develop the capacity to defend their security interests, but it is uncertain
that the hard budgetary decisions will be made to support such a decision. Also, financial
volatilty and economic turmoil generated by the war in the Balkans could endanger the
euro. American hesitation toward future financial initiatives and contributions aimed at
regional reconstruction in the Balkans could further complicate relations. Failure to
achieve short-term political objectives and long-term economic development goals could be
a source of open discord in both NATO and the EU.</font></p>
</font><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Recommendations</font></b><font SIZE="3"></p>

<ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">If the United States values the transatlantic
    economic, political, and security relationships it developed during the Cold War, it
    should become more cognizant of the changes the European Monetary Union will bring to
    world financial and trade markets and take the steps needed to accommodate the competition
    this will engender.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Discrepancies between the global view of security
    threats held by the United States and the intra-national economic and unemployment view of
    the EU states should be accepted as practicable differences in sovereign viewpoints. The
    United States should continue to urge the EU states to pay attention to rising global or
    regional threats that may affect EU interests as significantly as unemployment or
    financial union.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Policymakers should bear in mind that the
    political nature of, and the political boundaries of, even its closest transatlantic
    allies are subject to change.</font></p>
  </li>
