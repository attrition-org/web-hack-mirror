<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Conclusions</font></b><font SIZE="3"></p>

<ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Uncertainty remains in the Asia-Pacific region
    years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Several nations in the region are expanding
    or modernizing their military capabilities. Continuing tension on the Korean peninsula, as
    well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems add,
    to the region&#146;s instability.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Based on &quot;the National Defense Program
    Outline in and after FY 1996&quot;, Japan is reshaping its defense capability, but it
    remains committed to four fundamentals: it maintains an exclusively defense-oriented
    policy, avoids developing military capabilities that might threaten other countries,
    adheres to non-nuclear principles, and upholds civilian control of the military.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The <i>Japan-U.S. Joint Declaration on Security:
    Alliance for the 21st Century</i> in April 1996 reaffirmed the importance of the
    Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. The declaration addressed bilateral cooperative efforts
    designed to increase the credibility of the security relationship and the initiation of a
    review of the 1978 Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">North Korea&#146;s missile launch in August 1998
    awakened most Japanese to the military threats facing Japan and stimulated discussion on
    Guideline-related bills and on the legal issues concerning emergency situations. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) need to
    develop joint operational expertise and overall intelligence capabilities for dealing with
    emergency situations. The SDF also needs to use defense diplomacy to help develop a more
    stable regional security environment.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Japan&#146;s Basic Defense Policies</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Following World War II Japan&#146;s Imperial Army
and Navy were dissolved, and the old regime was replaced with a democratic government.
Article 9 of the new Constitution of Japan renounced war or even possessing combat
potential.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">However, the Cold War and the Korean War forced
Japan to reestablish defensive capabilities. A constitutional interpretation of Article 9
grants Japan the inherent right of self-defense and the possession of the minimum armed
strength needed to exercise that right. The Government of Japan (GOJ) viewpoint has been
that building forces to defend the region, even under a collective defense umbrella,
exceeds the minimum necessary strength required for the self-defense of Japan.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The GOJ has maintained the SDF, improved its
defensive capability, and conducted operations, in accordance with four fundamentals. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><b>Exclusively Defense-Oriented Policy.</b> This
policy means that defense forces cannot be used until an armed attack on Japan is
initiated by another country, and that the use of such forces is kept to the minimum
necessary for self-defense. Moreover, the defense capability of Japan must be limited to
the minimum necessary level.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><b>Not Posing a Military Threat to other Countries.</b>
Japan will not possess, beyond the minimum necessary level for self-defense, military
forces strong enough to pose a military threat to other countries.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><b>Adhering to Three Non-Nuclear Principles.</b> The
three non-nuclear principles include: &quot;not possessing nuclear weapons, not producing
them and not permitting their introduction in Japan.&quot; Japan ratified the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1976, placing itself under obligation, as a non-nuclear weapon
state, not to produce or acquire nuclear weapons.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><b>Ensuring Civilian Control of the Military.</b>
The democratic government maintains control of the military. Due to the regrettable
situations in Japan in the pre-World War II era, it has adopted an uncompromising system
of civilian controls.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">National Defense Program Outline in and after FY
1996</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Until FY 1995, Japan had been improving its defense
capability pursuant to the 1976 &quot;National Defense Program Outline (NDPO).&quot; The
SDF has played increasingly diverse roles in dealing with large-scale disasters and
contributing towards a more stable security environment by participating in international
peace cooperation activities, in addition to its principal mission of defending Japan. The
GOJ established the &quot;NDPO in and after FY 1996&quot;, to reshape the SDF to
effectively conduct the following roles and missions:</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><b>National Defense.</b> Prevent aggression against
Japan and maintain the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. Japan relies upon U.S. nuclear
deterrence against the threat of nuclear weapons, yet it actively participates in
international efforts for realistic and steady nuclear disarmament, aimed at establishing
a world free from nuclear weapons.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Should indirect aggression, or any military activity
that might lead to aggression, against Japan occur, the SDF would act to quickly settle
the situation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Should direct aggression occur, the SDF would
conduct joint operations, in cooperation with the United States, to quickly repel such
aggression.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><b>Coping with large-scale disasters and various
other situations.</b> In case of large-scale natural disasters, terrorism, or other
situations that require the protection of people&#146;s lives and assets, the SDF would
conduct necessary and timely operations in close cooperation with related organizations.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Should a situation arise near Japan that would have
an important influence on Japan&#146;s peace and security, the SDF would act in accordance
with the Constitution of Japan by properly supporting UN activities and by coordinating
with the United States.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><b>Contribution to a more stable security
environment.</b> The SDF contributes to international peace efforts by participating in UN
Peacekeeping Operations and international disaster relief activities. It promotes
confidence-building measures through security dialogues and other defense-related exchange
activities with other nations.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Japan cooperates with the UN and other international
organizations to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their
delivery systems, as well as to control and regulate conventional weapons.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The SDF is reshaping and strengthening its force
structure based on the 1996 NDPO. The enhancement of the Joint Staff Council&#146;s
functions, and closer relationships among related organizations within the Japan Defense
Agency (JDA), are highlighted in the SDF reshaping process. The new force structure of the
SDF is shown in Table 1.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Comparison of Japan&#146;s Defense Expenditure with
Other Nations</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Table 2 compares Japanese defense expenditures to
those of other major Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations.
The comparison shows that despite Japan&#146;s effort to spend less than one percent of
its GDP on defense, it still supports defense at roughly the same total level as
America&#146;s other major power allies (France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.)</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Reaffirmation of U.S.-Japan Arrangements</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Japan and the United States have worked closely to
increase the credibility of the bilateral alliance. The results of this cooperation were
published in the <i>Japan-U.S. Joint Declaration on Security: Alliance for the 21st
Century,</i> which was signed by former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and President
William Clinton on April 17, 1996.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The Joint Declaration reaffirmed that the Japan-U.S.
security relationship remains the cornerstone for achieving common security objectives and
maintaining a stable and prosperous environment for the Asia-Pacific region for the 21st
century. It addressed the following:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Enhancement of the exchange of information and
    views on the international situation, and consultation on defense policies and military
    postures;</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">A review of the 1978 Guidelines for Japan-U.S.
    Defense Cooperation, and studies on bilateral cooperation in dealing with situations in
    areas surrounding Japan that will have an important influence on the peace and security of
    Japan;</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Further cooperation based on the Japan-U.S.
    agreement concerning the reciprocal provision of logistics support, supplies, and services
    between the SDF and the U.S. Forces;</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Enhancement of the mutual exchange of technology
    and equipment; and</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Prevention of the proliferation of WMD and their
    delivery systems and cooperation in the ongoing study on ballistic missile defense.</font></font></p>
    <font SIZE="3"></li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img src="www163a.gif" width="404" height="1876"
alt="www163a.gif (85990 bytes)" align="left"><font face="Arial">The Joint Declaration also
stated that the two governments will strive to achieve a more peaceful and stable security
environment in the Asia-Pacific region. It recognizes that U.S. engagement in the region,
supported by the U.S.-Japan security relationship, constitutes the foundation for such
efforts. With regard to global cooperation, the Joint Declaration referred to the two
governments&#146; cooperation in support of the UN and other international organizations
through peacekeeping and humanitarian relief operations, and to their coordination on such
issues as arms control and disarmament.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Guidelines Review and Legislation of the
Guidelines-Related Bills</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The 1996 Joint Declaration provided for a review of
the 1978 Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation to enhance the credibility of the
bilateral security relationship. These review activities were conducted by the
Subcommittee for Defense Cooperation, which consists of Japanese bureau directors and U.S.
assistant secretaries, under a Japan&#150;U.S. ministerial/secretarial level committee,
the Security Consultative Committee (SCC). After a 15-month review, the new Guidelines for
Japan-U.S. defense cooperation were approved and published by the SCC on September 23,
1997. The aims of the new guidelines are:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">To create a solid basis for more effective and
    credible U.S.-Japan cooperation in peace, in case of an armed attack against Japan, and in
    situations in areas surrounding Japan that will have an important influence on
    Japan&#146;s peace and security.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">To provide a general framework and policy
    direction for the roles and missions of the two countries and ways of cooperating and
    coordinating, both in peacetime and during contingencies.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The 1997 Guidelines and programs under the
Guidelines are consistent with the following basic premises and principles:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The rights and obligations under the U.S.-Japan
    Security Treaty and its related arrangements, as well as the fundamental framework of the
    U.S.-Japan alliance, will remain unchanged. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Japan will conduct all its actions within the
    limitations of its Constitution and in accordance with its four fundamental priniciples.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The 1997 Guidelines detail Japan-U.S cooperation
matters regarding (1) normal circumstances, (2) actions in response to an armed attack
against Japan, and (3) situations in areas surrounding Japan. Information sharing and
policy consultation, various types of security cooperation, and bilateral programs are
highlighted for cooperation under normal circumstances. Operations in case of an armed
attack against Japan are also addressed in the 1997 Guidelines. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The Guidelines clarify what Japan can do in
situations in areas surrounding Japan in order to enhance the credibility of the
Japan-U.S. security arrangements. The Guidelines address the following fields of
cooperation in situations in areas surrounding Japan: </font></p>

<ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Cooperation in activities initiated by either
    Government (relief activities regarding refugees, search and rescue operations,
    noncombatant evacuation operations, activities for ensuring the effectiveness of economic
    sanctions);</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Japan&#146;s support for U.S. Forces activities
    (use of facilities by U.S. Forces, rear area support); and,</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Japan-U.S. operational cooperation (surveillance,
    minesweeping, sea and airspace management).</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The GOJ laid the Guidelines-related bills before the
Diet last year in order to ensure the effectiveness of the 1997 Guidelines by authorizing
the SDF to conduct necessary cooperative activities. The lower house has approved the
legislation and the upper house approval is expected soon.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Some Future Prospects</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The Defense Guidelines Review and Guidelines-related
legislation will facilitate the credibility of the bilateral defense cooperation. The JDA
also fosters defense diplomacy through bilateral and multilateral security dialogues and
several kinds of defense-related exchanges, especially with nations in the Asia-Pacific
region. Japan will continue its defense diplomacy and maintain its strategic bilateral tie
with the United States. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img src="www163b.gif" width="652" height="310"
alt="www163b.gif (204387 bytes)"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The North Korean three-stage missile launch over
Japan in August 1998 will probably result in additional legislation on emergency
situations. At the same time, the SDF will develop its joint operational capability and
its bilateral operational cooperation with the U.S. Armed Forces. The JDA is increasing
resources to improve intelligence capabilities and its dissemination of reliable, timely
products to SDF and GOJ customers.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Instability and uncertainty in the Asia-Pacific
region will exist into the foreseeable future. Japan is likely to reformulate its security
strategy and defense policies to reduce the threats posed by WMD and their delivery
systems. Tokyo will continue to cultivate a more peaceful and stable security environment
in the region.</font></p>
