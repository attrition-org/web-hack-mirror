<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Conclusions </font></b><font SIZE="3"></p>

<ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">There are strategic and moral advantages to
    expressly articulating a right of humanitarian intervention (jus ad interventionem) under
    international law to stop or prevent genocide or violent mass ethnic expulsions. Aside
    from acting as a deterrent to future threats to international peace and security, such a
    right to intervene may secure greater global support by seizing the moral high-ground. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">This right to intervene must be limited in
    purpose, scope, and means in order to prevent its abuse by hegemons and aggressors and to
    quell concerns that this is a carte blanche for the use of force. International law should
    strive for comprehensible standards in the area of humanitarian intervention and provide
    for predictability in rules of behavior and, thus, enhance stability. An unlimited right
    of intervention or war is inimical to international peace and security.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Where feasible, the use of force should be applied
    in concert with pacific means of dispute settlement (Art, 33, UN Charter) and economic
    sanctions (Chapter VII) to halt or deter genocide (as defined by the 1948 Genocide
    Convention). </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The use of force may be applied when the UN
    Security Council is unable or unwilling to act to prevent or halt genocide and there is
    broad collective support for action to intervene in the otherwise sovereign affairs of the
    state affected. This collective support may be evidenced by a decision of the UN General
    Assembly or other major international representative bodies.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The use of force must observe the customary
    principles of proportionality, discrimination/ humanity, and necessity by avoiding
    unnecessary harm to noncombatants and directing force against the actual wrongdoers.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The intervention should end as soon as practical
    and sovereignty be restored to the target state, but only after reasonable assurances that
    the acts of genocide will not be resumed and after reserving the right to reintervene if
    need be. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Traditional Notions of Sovereignty: Non-intervention</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">British Prime Minister Tony Blair, in his April 22
speech in Chicago, laid out the justification for the Kosovo mission, emphasizing the need
for &quot;new rules for international cooperation,&quot; the importance of a &quot;world
ruled by law,&quot; and the necessity for reform of the UN as &quot;the central
pillar&quot; of international cooperation and stability. By contrast, the U.S.
administration has based its action primarily on the principle of collective self-defense,
as embodied in Article V of the North Atlantic Charter and Article 51 of the United
Nations Charter. Nevertheless, it is becoming apparent that the reliance upon collective
self-defense for future actions to stop or prevent genocide will likely be problematic,
either because genocide could conceivably be carried out within a nation without credibly
threatening other nations, or because other nations would be reluctant to intervene
without an express international legal warrant. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">From the perspective of many observers, the wanton
expulsions and killings by Yugoslav forces in the Kosovo province have given rise to a
&quot;humanitarian imperative&quot; to intervene militarily, to the detriment of
traditional notions of state sovereignty. From another viewpoint, intervention may be
justified not by moralistic impulses, but rather by significant U.S. and alliance
interests in securing peace and stability in Europe. From either perspective, it is clear
that the Kosovo mission differs qualitatively from previous humanitarian missions. While
the principle of the sovereign equality of states has been the underlying legal basis for
the international system since the Treaties of Westphalia in 1648, recent events have led
to what amounts to a serious rethinking of the strict adherence to non-intervention in the
domestic affairs of states under certain circumstances. A new norm is emerging that views
legitimacy of the sovereign as derived from the people; sovereignty, therefore, is
forfeited by the most egregious violations of the fundamental rights of people, such as
genocide. The Westphalian order is challenged by the decline of states as principal
players in international life, by the rise of non-state actors, by the expansion of
international business relationships, and by the increase of transnational crime,
refugees, etc. The imperative that a sovereign&#146;s rights took precedence over human
rights is now past its zenith. International law has been slow to catch up to this
reality, but it is doing so through evolving customary practices embodied in the
principled interventions in Somalia, Northern Iraq, and Kosovo. This trend against
traditional notions of sovereignty is disturbing to states such as Russia, China, and
India, which fear that a change to the rules could eventually lead to interventions in
their internal affairs. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Despite ample treaties and conventions purporting to
guarantee human rights and prevent genocide, there exists no explicit authority for
humanitarian intervention. Notions of emerging international morality have provided the
strongest justification for military intervention. The United Nations Charter (Article 42,
Chapter VII) provides that the Security Council may authorize intervention of armed forces
to &quot;maintain or restore international peace and security.&quot; Though it addresses
&quot;threats to the peace&quot; and &quot;acts of aggression&quot; rather than
humanitarian disasters per se, Chapter VII powers were used by the UN Security Council to
authorize interventions in Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, and Bosnia. Operation Provide Comfort
in northern Iraq had no express UN Security Council authorization, though the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees participated in arrangements for a security zone for the Kurds. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The Use of Force: A Limited Right</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">By one view, every sovereign state retains a right
to conduct war, whenever and however it pleases and for whatever reason, limited only by
the effectual use of countervailing power by adversaries. This view raises many problems
in the quest for international peace and security under existing norms and international
law, where there is little evidence of an unlimited &quot;right to war&quot; per se.
Rather, international law has long supported the right of &quot;self-defense.&quot; This
can be seen in St. Augustine&#146;s Just War (Jus ad Bellum) doctrine. The Kellogg-Briand
Pact of 1928 explicitly renounced the use of war as a sovereign right of nations. Not a
mere quixotic exercise, this law was used as the basis for the charges of waging a war of
aggression (crimes against peace) during the Nürnberg International Military Tribunal
sessions, resulting in death sentences for certain members of the German High Command
following World War II. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The UN Charter further reiterates the renunciation
of war as a sovereign right in Article 2 (4): &quot;All Members shall refrain in their
international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity
or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the
Purposes of the United Nations.&quot; Essentially, the UN Charter has replaced the term
war with three options: aggression (Art. 2(4)), self-defense (Art. 51), and enforcement
action (Chapter VII). Some would add peacekeeping (so-called &quot;Chapter 6 1/2&quot;
operations) to the list, though this terminology appears nowhere in the Charter.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The Historical Abuse of Intervention</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Although scholars as far back as Grotius have argued
for a right to use force for humanitarian intervention, there is a lack of consistent
consensus (opinio juris communis) under international law. In the checkered history of
humanitarian interventions, the use of force has frequently been colored by a clash of
values and cultures, as seen in several examples of western and Russian interventions
against the Turks: in Greece in 1827, in Syria in 1860; in Bosnia, Herzegovina, and
Bulgaria in 1877, and in Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia in 1913. Hegemons and aggressors
have found &quot;humanitarian&quot; intervention to be a useful tool. An example of an
intervention which led to growing disrepute for the doctrine was Hitler&#146;s use of
force to &quot;defend&quot; ethnic Germans in the Sudetenland as a pretext for his
invasion of Czechoslovakia. Humanitarian justifications were also used during the 1971
Indian intervention in East Pakistan, the 1978 Vietnamese intervention against the Khmer
Rouge in Cambodia, the 1979 Tanzanian intervention against Idi Amin in Uganda, and the
1979 French intervention against the Bokassa regime in the Central African Republic. Until
recently, Western states focused on diplomatic and economic instruments to deal with
humanitarian intervention. In the 1980s, humanitarian arguments were used to justify the
imposition of economic sanctions on South Africa&#146;s apartheid regime. In the 1990s,
military intervention returned to vogue, beginning with the creation of a protective zone
for Kurds in northern Iraq, followed by operations in Somalia and Haiti. Yet, today there
are no sources that explicitly and authoritatively grant a right to humanitarian
intervention. The 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide, which entered into force in 1951, provides for prosecution of violators but does
not authorize armed intervention to prevent or stop genocide. Nor do the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
authorize humanitarian interventions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Under customary international law, sovereign states
are protected by the rule of noninterference or nonintervention: states must refrain from
interfering in the domestic affairs of other states. Treaty obligations, such as the
United Nations Charter (ratified by the U.S. Senate as a treaty and implemented via the UN
Participation Act of 1945) also provide some guidance. Specifically, Article 2(4) of the
Charter restrains members &quot;from the threat or use of force against the territorial
integrity or political independence of any state&#133;&quot; But sovereignty is not an
absolute right, as Article 2(7) makes clear: &quot;Nothing contained in the present
Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially
within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such
matters to settlement under the present Charter; <i>but the principle shall not prejudice
the application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII.&quot;</i> [Author emphasis] Yet
it is one thing to recognize that, in case of human rights violations, sovereignty is not
an absolute right (for example, it may be breached by non-military intervention, such as
diplomatic and medical personnel) and quite another to breach sovereignty by the
nonconsensual intervention of military forces. Chapter VII states that action of the
&quot;air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international
peace and security&quot; can be authorized by the UN Security Council under Art. 42.
Articles 55 and 56 imply an affirmative obligation of member states to take joint and
separate action to promote &quot;universal respect for, and observance of, human rights
and fundamental freedoms for all.&quot; </font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The Case of Kosovo</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The United Nations cannot be relied upon in every
case to authorize humanitarian intervention. The UN Security Council found the existence
of a threat to peace and enjoined Serbia to reduce troops in Kosovo but did not
specifically authorize the use of force. UNSC Resolutions 1199 and 1203 affirmed that the
deterioration of the situation in Kosovo constituted a threat to the peace and security of
the region. But unlike resolutions regarding Kuwait, Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia, these
resolutions did not authorize the use of armed forces. UNSC 1199 did call for a ceasefire
in accordance with Chapter VII. UNSC 1203 demanded cooperation with the Organization on
Security and Cooperation in Europe verification mission. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">A UN mandate promotes international legitimacy,
strengthens the evolving customary practice of humanitarian intervention, and provides an
easy way around the sovereignty issue. The UN mandate largely eliminated sovereignty as an
issue for military interventions in Somalia and Haiti. Historically, NATO has not needed a
UN mandate when acting in self-defense under Article V of the North Atlantic Charter.
Article 51 of the UN Charter recognizes that: &quot;Nothing in the present Charter shall
impair the inherent right of individual and collective self-defense &#133;&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">NATO&#146;s Charter (Article V) incorporated the
principle of self-defense (&quot;armed attack against one or more&quot; members in Europe
or North America) via Article 51 of the UN Charter. NATO is thus legitimized as a
collective self-defense organization, but it is not a collective security organization,
such as the UN, nor an authorized regional arrangement to enforce international peace and
security under Chapter VIII (Art. 53) of the UN Charter. Some legal scholars do not
categorize the Kosovo action as a self-defense action, because there has been no armed
attack within the meaning of Article V. Certain disaster relief and humanitarian actions
(non-Article V missions) have been taken on by NATO armed forces in the past decade, but
the use of force is a different question altogether, because, for obvious reasons, it is
subject to more stringent rules. This underscores the need for a new understanding and
legitimation for NATO missions and roles. Although the U.S. constitutional treatment of
war powers is beyond the scope of this article, it is worth noting that international
legitimation, particularly through the UN, has been a significant part of domestic U.S.
legitimation. For example, the congressional resolution authorizing use of force during
the Gulf War (H.J. RES. 77) began with the words: &quot;To authorize the use of U.S. armed
forces pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 678&#133;&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Hence, to argue that the Kosovo action is legitimate
or not under international law is to miss the crucial problem altogether. The law evolves
from international notions of moral conscience that rise to the level of obligatory
behavior. Such law is clearly derived from the notion of international community in which
enforcement sometimes is necessary to ensure minimal standards of human dignity and
decency, as recognized by civilized nations. As Jack Donnelly argues, humanitarian
intervention rests on the notion that the principle of self-determination is being negated
when a genocidal regime does not have the consent of the people, so the legal principle of
nonintervention does not apply. One concern is that legislating intervention on
humanitarian principles will only send statesmen into a flurry of activity to measure how
many atrocities amount to the requisite legal standard. While such laws will serve their
purpose for the odd pariah, one may argue that they will do little to oblige states to
follow what is truly needed: an international standard of morality. Rather, it will be the
consistent, logical, and earnest pursuit of moral principles from which customary
international law will flow. It is this latter contingency that is demonstrated by the
current mission in Kosovo. International law, as does domestic law, must flow from the
concept of the common good. Enforcing principles of right and wrong will not instill a
sense of morality; rather, such morality must derive from a sense of obligation to higher
standards.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Where Do We Go from Here?</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The absence of an existing right to humanitarian
intervention does not deprive us of action or a remedy; but it compels us to make the case
for such a right. Because customary international law evolves, new law can be created. As
certain principles become accepted by sufficient nations as international law <i>(opinio
juris communis)</i>, and there is general practice <i>(usus)</i> recognizing the principle
as international law, the principles gradually become customary international law. A
proposed strategy for promoting this evolution would entail proffering the principle for
adoption by the international community as international law (much as the Anti-Personnel
Landmines Ban NGOs attempted). This may be in the form of an international convention or a
UN General Assembly resolution or both. Either forum is not dispositive on the matter but
can act as evidence of, and lay the groundwork for, international recognition of a right
to humanitarian intervention when the UN Security Council is unable or unwilling to act.
This would be akin to the UNGA&#146;s Uniting for Peace Resolution of 1950, under which it
took upon itself the authorization of the use of force &quot;if the Security Council,
because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security&#133;&quot; Through
this resolution, many peacekeeping missions were authorized during subsequent years by the
General Assembly rather than the Security Council. When the Soviet Union and France
challenged the legality of the Congo intervention in 1960, the International Court of
Justice (advisory opinion in the <i>Certain Expenses Case, 1962</i>) upheld the UNGA
action. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The right of intervention must be restricted to the
most egregious violations of human rights, such as genocide and violent mass ethnic
expulsions. The mode and means of intervention should be likewise restricted so as to
avoid even a resemblance to aggression. Both the right to resort to force <i>(ad bellum)</i>
and the application of force <i>(in belli)</i> are crucial, not only to classical Just War
doctrine, but to winning the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; campaign in the community of
nations. Law is the policy tool of choice for standards to distinguish humanitarian
intervention from aggression.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In the end, legal and moral legitimation carry
significant political weight in the conduct of world affairs. On its most practical level,
international legitimation, through articulated principles of international law, can serve
to distinguish between aggression and humanitarian intervention, and provide standards of
behavior for states such as Russia, India, and China, thereby enhancing stability. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Prime Minister Blair&#146;s assertion of a need for
new rules of international cooperation should be given serious thought.</font></p>
