<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Conclusions</font></b><font SIZE="3"></p>

<ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The NATO Washington Summit and the war in Kosovo
    pose serious challenges for the Partnership for Peace (PFP) in implementing reforms among
    its 24 partners and dealing with the expectations of the nine partners seeking NATO
    membership.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Because the nine partners of the Membership Action
    Plan (MAP) have heightened expectations of NATO membership, the continuing lack of an
    invitation could lead to disillusionment. This could lead to cleavage among MAP partners.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Lessons learned by Poland, Hungary, and the Czech
    Republic suggest that the nine MAP partners may find their human and material resources
    overwhelmed in harmonizing NATO Standardized Agreements (STANAGs) to their defense
    establishments and in responding to the NATO Defense Capabilities Initiative. The result
    could develop two-tier armed forces in the MAP states, one tier designed to function
    within the PFP, the second developed according to national defense, but neither able to
    function well as a whole.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;A &quot;security earthquake&quot; shook Europe
during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Limited crises reappeared and began to haunt
Europe, making NATO look outward and take steps to project stability&#151;its new
mechanism was cooperation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC),
formed in November 1991, brought former adversaries together to talk and to begin
multilateral cooperation, not partnership. The emerging political dialogue helped Central
and East European (CEE) politicians to better understand defense requirements; they slowly
began to realize that defense encompassed more than just military issues (e.g., civil
emergency planning, air space management, etc.) </font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">PFP Genesis and Evolution</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Partnership For Peace has undergone enormous change
since its inception at the January 1994 Brussels Summit. Though some in CEE initially saw
PFP as a palliative (no enlargement), PFP did move non-NATO members beyond dialogue and
into practical partnership. PFP developed a framework and process; it established the norm
that partners should be &quot;contributors&quot; and marked a shift from purely
multilateral dialogue to bilateral (partner and Alliance) relationships in the form of
Individual Partnership Programs (IPPs) and self-differentiation. It marked the
establishment of a wide environment of cooperation, to include the Planning and Review
Process (PARP), transparency, civil control/oversight of the military, and peace support
operations. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The July 1997 Madrid Summit made PFP more relevant
and operational by introducing enhanced PFP and a second PARP cycle. It also marked the
introduction of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC)&#151;which replaced the
NACC&#151;and creation of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council (PJC) and NATO-Ukraine
Commission to keep Russia and Ukraine engaged in the partnership. It was also marked by
the invitation of three PFP states to join in membership talks with NATO.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">By the April 1999 Washington Summit, Poland,
Hungary, and the Czech Republic had joined NATO. The summit introduced programs to make
PFP more operational and approved the new Alliance Strategic Concept, which for the first
time mentioned PFP (para. 35) as an Alliance activity. It launched a Defense Capabilities
Initiative to improve interoperability among Alliance forces and, where applicable,
between Alliance and partner forces. The Membership Action Plan (MAP) and a third PARP
cycle were intended to establish closer relations among partners and the Alliance for
common operations.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">NATO is developing an operational capabilities
concept (OCC) that should help to engage partners in future military operations by
identifying national or multinational forces that can be used in non-Article 5 activities.
The OCC should be developed by autumn 1999 and will result in a pool of forces that can
augment NATO forces. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The MAPs, a practical manifestation of the NATO
(Article 10) Open Door policy, identify five partner activity areas (political and
economic, defense/military, resources, security, and legal) that develop the capabilities
needed for membership. The MAP annual National Plan (ANPs) generated by each partner allow
each to set their own objectives and targets on preparations for possible future
membership.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The PARP has been further enhanced so that it is
similar to the force planning procedures among the allies. Ministerial guidance sets
partner target force goals to build capabilities and permits partner support elements to
be involved in exercise planning.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In sum, the Washington Summit poses serious
challenges for PFP in the form of greater differentiation among the 24 partners (9 MAP and
15 non-MAP). In addition, because it is implausible to admit nine new members in the near
term, the North Atlantic Council (NAC) must successfully deal with the expectations and
needs of the MAP partners.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">External Challenges</b> </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The PFP future is challenged not only by internal
factors, such as how well partners implement reform, but also by the external environment.
</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Kosovo is one external factor that will affect the
PFP future of some partners. For those opposed to NATO actions in Kosovo (e.g., Russia),
the phrase &quot;partnership for peace&quot; now has a hollow ring. NATO actions reinforce
their perception that it intends to interfere in national internal affairs. To change this
perception, NATO needs to make PFP a flexible forum to explain its policies and listen to
the views of those who may not share the same perspective. PFP is an open door to the rest
of the world; some partners argue that that door needs to remain two way.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Another external effect of the war in Kosovo on NATO
political decisions is the yet unanswered question of whether the war will become a
catalyst for South East European enlargement or whether lessons learned from Kosovo by the
NAC, at 19, could become an impediment to further enlargement.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Finally, another external factor is the so-called
&quot;new member&quot; effect. For example, if new members fail to meet NATO force goals
and create the impression that enlargement has contributed to more &quot;consumers&quot;
and not &quot;producers&quot; of security, NATO might well be hesitant to further enlarge
anytime soon.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Lessons Learned by the New NATO Members</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Because Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are
the only NATO members who have been PFP partners, their experience is particularly useful
in helping the Alliance deal with the partnership&#146;s new challenges. One fundamental
difference between the three new allies and current PFP partners is that each new member
significantly downsized its armed forces <i>before</i> accession; experiencing many of the
resulting social pains and political consequences prior to accession. Nevertheless, these
new members have many of the same military challenges as the partners, such as dealing
with top-heavy officer corps, reducing conscription service, building noncommissioned
officer corps, and modernizing armed forces with scarce resources. Their experience can
help the Alliance to more effectively implement PFP after the Washington Summit.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The experiences of the new members highlight three
major gaps that could affect the PFP.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">1. Political ambition drove the three new members;
as a result, practical cooperation was merely a derivative of the process. The disparity
between partner expectations and reality was large, even at accession on March 12, 1999.
Their general staffs stressed military modernization; the defense ministries, the
political imperatives. Funds were scarce and bureaucratic hurdles immense. The entire
political system was not ready for NATO membership. But Poland, Hungary, and the Czech
Republic differed from the nine MAP partners in that they held an invitation since July
1997, so their governments had political reason to justify devoting scarce resources to
the armed forces. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">2. Resource scarcity (in terms of trained personnel
and money) is similar. For the three new members, the PARP prepared roughly 15 percent of
the armed forces to NATO standards, creating dislocations among the remaining forces and
resulting in two-tier military structures. The enhanced (third cycle) PFP and Defense
Capabilities Initiative applies PARP procedures to all the MAP partners&#146; armed
forces. This is not only a great burden to the MAP partners' nascent militaries and
defense ministries; it also creates an implicit NATO obligation toward partners who do not
yet enjoy Article 5 protection.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">3. The application and incorporation of NATO STANAGs
were huge hurdles and overburdened the physical capacity of the new members. For example,
it was an enormous effort for Hungary just to translate 621 STANAGs into Hungarian and
begin military harmonization. Poland was overwhelmed. Initially it needed to build from
just three people to roughly 600 to harmonize the 50 initial NATO STANAGs, to roughly 700
STANAGs by the Madrid Summit, to 1,500 by the time of accession. The 1,169 STANAGs now
made available to MAP partners could likely overwhelm their limited physical capacities.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">MAP Partner Expectations and NATO Challenges</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Compared to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic,
which downsized their armed forces before their entrance into NATO, the MAP partners
either must still downsize (Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia) or build new armed forces
(Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Slovenia). Albania and Macedonia fall into yet a third
MAP subgroup. As reduced partner armed forces result in social dislocation, NATO may
become the object of blame. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">NATO also needs to prevent two-tier armed forces
from developing among MAP partners. In their effort to achieve membership, the danger is
that MAP partner force distortions will result. For example, Slovakia is committing 5
percent of its defense budget just to PFP. If NATO ultimately does not reciprocate with an
invitation, some MAP partners may end up with two-tier forces that will have little
utility in helping the partner deal with its own security.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Though NATO has stated that the MAP is a
&quot;practical manifestation of the Open Door,&quot; and that the MAP &quot;does not
imply any timeframe for any accession decision nor any guarantee of eventual
membership,&quot; each MAP partner wants to (or actually does) believe an invitation is in
the offing. Each to varying degrees believes that its commitment of scarce resources to
augment NATO will result in a reciprocal obligation. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Hence, NATO needs to seriously consider just how far
the NAC at 19 can enlarge to accommodate the 7 to 9 MAP aspirants (to 26+?). If any or all
of the MAP aspirants fail to receive membership invitations, they will likely be
disillusioned, resulting in a cleavage of the MAP partners from the Alliance. Some MAP
partners have expressed skepticism about NATO efforts to develop regional cooperation in
the Baltic region and South Eastern Europe and fear that efforts to regionalize will
undermine the fulfillment of their enlargement objective. Hence, NATO needs to examine
seriously how far it is willing to enlarge and to stress that MAP participation prepares
the political conditions for compatibility but does not guarantee enlargement.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The ANP assessment is important to NATO credibility.
NATO feedback from the assessment to the MAPs needs to be rigorous and precise to
encourage real military reform, to temper potentially false expectations, and to stress
that the MAP is a route to compatibility, not necessarily a route to membership. This may
be difficult, because existing NATO staff, already burdened by 19 (rather than 16) Defense
Planning Questionaire assessments, would be further burdened by providing nine additional
ANP assessments. However, if NATO succeeds in providing rigorous appraisals that result in
partner reforms, it would imply a reciprocal NATO political commitment.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Another important NATO tool is the Defense
Capabilities Initiative. NATO has thus moved away from the merely diplomatic to being more
involved with the MAP partners&#146; force planning process. Some MAP partners actually
see the DCI as leading to a de facto (vice de jure) operational Article 5. The multi-year
planning guidelines help MAP partners sell their defense programs to their parliaments,
but, to the degree to which each MAP partner succeeds, the partner perceives a reciprocal
NATO obligation.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Fifteen non-MAP Partners</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The 15 non-MAP partners include Russia, Ukraine,
Belarus, and Moldova; the neutrals&#151;Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland; the
Caucasus&#151;Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan; and Central Asia&#151;Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Russia at first did not want to participate in PFP,
but as other countries joined they reluctantly approached the Alliance. Russia initially
refused to submit an IPP, then after six months submitted one they did not implement.
Later, Russia negotiated a second IPP they have not implemented. So, relations exist only
on an ad hoc basis working on specific activities. Russia has participated in IFOR/ SFOR
and participates on the EAPC and Political-Military Steering Group and other fora, but
mostly as a silent partner. They have essentially withdrawn from PFP and the NATO-Russia
Permanent Joint Council pending the outcome of the Kosovo conflict. It remains unclear
what relations will be after they return.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Ukraine&#146;s participation in PFP is the link
drawing Ukraine to the West. Since 1994, 5,000 military officers have participated in PFP
activities (3,800 in PFP military exercises). During the second PARP cycle, Ukraine
fulfilled 11 Interoperability Objectives thanks to NATO financial assistance.
Participation in IFOR/ SFOR has been important; in March 1999, NATO established a training
center and, in May, a liaison office in Kiev, which should give impetus to cooperation. In
sum, PFP remains Ukraine&#146;s main path to advance military training and to work with
the West.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Moldova, though a member of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, does not participate in any of its military or political-military
bodies. It pursues neutrality and does not see NATO enlargement as a threat to security.
Moldova sees active participation in PFP as an important avenue for its future integration
in European security structures. Not surprisingly, scarcity of economic resources,
language problems, and lack of experience constrain its participation in PFP activities.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Austria has been a member of the European Union (EU)
since January 1995, after which it joined the PFP (February 1995). PFP plays an important
political unifying function by allowing Austria to maintain neutrality while meeting its
EU peace support operations requirement. After the July 1997 Madrid Summit, Austria joined
the EAPC, but delayed participating in enhanced PFP until November 1998. Austria now has
diplomatic representation and staff elements at NATO headquarters. PFP is important in
that it is the only dimension in Austria&#146;s security policy (aside from EU and Common
Foreign and Security Policy) that has a consensus among all the political parties
represented in its Parliament.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Croatia is not yet a member of PFP because of
incomplete implementation of Dayton, return of refugees, and democratization. It has made
progress in all three deficiencies and views the partnership as a path toward full NATO
membership. In sum, it plans to join the MAP.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Initial concerns about differentiated (MAP and
non-MAP) partnerships resulting from the Washington Summit may have been overdrawn. Many
non-MAP partner subgroups appear to exist. As a result, participation in the Partnership
may atrophy for some (Russia, Belarus), but become more significant among others
(Austria), particularly among partners with greater proclivity toward liberal democratic
institutions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Recommendations</font></b><font SIZE="3"></p>

<ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">U.S. bilateral efforts will most likely be needed
    in aiding partners' nascent defense ministries by training civilian and military personnel
    to fulfill MAP and STANAG requirements.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">U.S. defense assessments that have been conducted
    for some MAP partners&#151;Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Bulgaria, and Romania&#151;also
    need to be provided to Slovakia and Slovenia. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">NATO credibility on further enlargement and its
    capability to encourage partner military reforms will hinge, in large measure, on how
    thorough and critical its annual National Program Assessments are conducted. Hence, NATO
    needs to ensure that adequate staff elements are available to meet the task.</font></p>
