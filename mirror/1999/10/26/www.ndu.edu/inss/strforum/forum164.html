<p><font face="Arial">Conclusions</font></b><font SIZE="3">

<ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The Bundeswehr, a modern, professional,
    well-trained force of some 340,000 troops, is at the end of a restructuring process which
    started in 1992. This restructuring was accomplished even as Germany's armed forces
    successfully contributed to international peace operations.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Universal conscription remains a structural
    feature of the German armed forces.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The Crisis Reaction Forces, comprising some 50,000
    volunteers from the active component, are Germany's readily available contribution for
    international military missions.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The Main Defense Forces are the backbone of
    Germany's commitment to national and Alliance defense. Their strategic value lies in
    balancing the overall strategic situation in Europe.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The new Special Forces Command is able to operate
    across the entire mission spectrum. It has proven its capabilities by bringing war
    criminals to the International Court of Justice at The Hague.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Future restructuring, perhaps triggered by budget
    constraints, by the increasing cost of new systems, and by the revolution in military
    affairs, will probably be an evolutionary, rather than a revolutionary process.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Germany in Europe</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Germany borders nine states, more than any other
European country. It is and always has been, with some exceptions such as the period of
the Third Reich and the Cold War, a transit country for people, goods, and traffic
throughout Europe. Due to its location, Germany has been affected by the major political,
cultural, and intellectual currents in Europe&#151;be it the Reformation, the
Enlightenment, democracy, socialism, or communism&#151;and often those ideas were raised
or developed by German thinkers and philosophers. This fact may be reflected in the
thinking of some intellectual and political circles or in the programs of some political
parties.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">With more than 82 million inhabitants, Germany
(after Russia) is the second most populous state and the strongest economic power in
Europe. Its geographic location has enabled it to serve as a bridge, especially between
the states of Western Europe and the new Central and Eastern European democracies. In view
of its location and size and its economic strengths, Germany has a particular
responsibility to bear for peace and understanding in Europe.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">At the end of the East-West conflict, the
Bundeswehr, the armed forces of a now unified Germany, faced the greatest challenges of
any of NATO&#146;s armed forces. It had to:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">reduce its military strength from some 600,000
    military personnel (Bundeswehr and National Peoples Army-NPA) to 370,000 by 1994 according
    to international agreements,</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">reduce military material and equipment on a large
    scale under the CFE treaty,</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">contribute to the German National Program of Unity
    by establishing new Bundeswehr units and agencies in the new German states, and</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">integrate former NPA soldiers into the Bundeswehr.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">At the same time, Germany&#146;s allies, friends,
and the international community were strongly urging it&#151;now unified, fully sovereign,
and a member of the UN&#151;to take part in international military peace operations. Step
by step, Germany assumed its responsibilities and has participated in more than 20 such
operations since 1991.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">However, due to its past, Germany will not
unilaterally undertake any military mission outside its national boundaries and,
therefore, will not try to acquire the capacity to do so. NATO remains our preferred
alliance for defense as well as for international military missions outside Germany.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Essential Aspects of German Foreign and Security
Policy</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">With the end of the Cold War, no significant threat
to either Germany or NATO&#146;s central region remains. However, a number of new crisis
regions pose significant potential risks in and for Europe. The Alliance has reacted to
those changes with the strategic concept agreed by the participating governments at the
Rome summit in 1991. In response, Germany revised its security policy goals and objectives
and decided on a new Bundeswehr structure. The principal objective of German foreign and
security policy is to safeguard the nation&#146;s peace, freedom, and independence.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Five basic goals have evolved from this overall
objective, including:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">strengthening links between Europe and the United
    States for our mutual benefit, thereby also strengthening and further developing NATO,
    which for the foreseeable future remains necessary for a stable peace in Europe;</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">continuing efforts to achieve European unity and
    enable Europe to speak with one voice on security policy and defense matters; </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">supporting the reform process, democratic
    development, and economic growth in the new Central and Eastern European democracies; </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">strengthening the United Nations as a global
    conflict-resolution body and the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
    as a regional organization; and</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">deepening partnerships with developing countries.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The tasks for the Bundeswehr have been defined as:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">protecting Germany and its citizens against
    external threats and political extortion;</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">defending Germany and its allies;</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">promoting military stability and European
    integration;</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">serving world peace and international security in
    accordance with the UN charter; and</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">providing disaster relief, saving lives, and
    supporting humanitarian activities.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Structure of the Bundeswehr</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The peacetime strength of the Bundeswehr is nearly
340,000 military and some 130,000 civilian personnel. Peacetime forces consist of 200,000
regulars and temporary career volunteers, up to 135,000 conscripts with varying terms of
service, and 5,000 reserve duty training positions. Its wartime strength could rise to
680,000. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The German armed forces are divided into three
categories, including the:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Basic Military Organization (BMO), which includes
    the military installations necessary for peacetime command, administration, support, and
    training</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Main Defense Forces (MDF), the backbone of
    national and Alliance defense, are mobilization-dependent </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Reaction Forces (RF) with a strength of some
    50,000 military personnel, all of them being regulars or temporary career volunteers. They
    are Germany&#146;s readily available contribution to NATO and WEU operations as well as to
    international military peace operations in a coalition. The RF meets NATO readiness
    standards. </font></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">National and Alliance defense remains the core
function of the German armed forces. Germany as a Central European power strongly believes
that its force contribution balances the European strategic situation. This dedication
also reassures new NATO members, who have a different perception about potential risks
than do Western European states. The posture of the German armed forces provides a high
degree of sustainability to both defense and missions in the new spectrum. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The German Army. The army has an overall peacetime
strength of some 233,400 soldiers, with the bulk of conscripts in this service. Its basic
structure consists of seven divisions and 20.5 active brigades (the half brigade is the
German contribution to the Franco-German brigade), plus four mechanized brigades, which
are not active but have the entire equipment prestocked.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The 37,000 soldiers in the RF include only regular
officers, NCOs, and enlisted men, including conscripts with prolonged time of service in
their units. The RF consists of two division staffs with up to six brigades, including two
mechanized brigades, one airborne brigade, one infantry brigade, and one air mechanized
brigade. Four additional brigades back up the RF. These forces are well-balanced in terms
of light and heavy units.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The German Army has some 3,100 main battle tanks,
most of them Leopard II; 4,200 armored vehicles; 2,070 artillery pieces, most of them
self-propelled; and some 250 antitank helicopters. The mobilized wartime strength of the
German Army is 505,000. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The German Air Force. The air force has a peacetime
strength of 77,000 airmen. The BMO, with approximately 28,700 airmen, supports both MDF
and RF.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Depending on individual tasks, the MDF, with
approximately 19,000 airmen, comprises augmentable units with various levels of
operational readiness. They have different roles in peacetime and are intended to fulfill
the main task of national and Alliance defense.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Available on short notice, the RF, with 12,300
airmen, would provide cover for the ongoing augmentation of the MDF.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><img src="www164a.gif" width="638" height="409"
alt="www164a.gif (96515 bytes)"><font SIZE="3" COLOR="#ff3300"><b></p>
</b></font><font SIZE="3">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The air combat units of the RF constitute the German
contribution to NATO Reaction Forces (Air) for the entire extended mission spectrum.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The German Navy. The German navy has more than
27,200 sailors within its basic structure. It includes 15 destroyers/frigates, 12
conventional submarines, 30 fast patrol boats/ corvettes, 25 mine warfare units, 12
maritime patrol aircraft, 45 helicopters, 50 naval fighter bombers, and 17 medium and
large support ships.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The navy generates its floating RF through a system
under which ships and boats continually rotate among training, deployment, and maintenance
stages, alternating between RF and MDF status. Whether certain units are assigned to the
RF depends on their training status. Generally speaking, up to 40 percent of the naval and
naval air forces, and up to 4,300 naval troops, belong to the RF. The navy provides two
ocean-going deployment groups, each composed of one core unit with up to three frigates
and additional units for surface and subsurface warfare, mine warfare, and air assets such
as fighter bombers, maritime patrol aircraft, and helicopters. In peacetime, the navy
provides one destroyer or frigate and one mine warfare unit each for the permanent NATO
deployment units in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and the European Northern Region. These
units represent the German naval contribution to NATO Reaction Forces. </font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Main Weapon Systems, Equipment, and Procurement</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The German armed forces have modern capabilities,
even in comparison with the U.S. Armed Forces. Major procurement programs include some 185
new armored self-propelled howitzer (Panzerhaubitze 2000), the most modern artillery
system in the world; 80 Tiger attack helicopters; 250 medium transport helicopters, NH 90;
180 new Eurofighters; 3 new frigates, F124; and four U212 medium-scale submarines, which
are modern conventional platforms. Furthermore, a new command and control system is soon
to be introduced into the army. German military thinking and consequent procurement has
always emphasized strengthening the teeth rather than the tail. But the armed forces have
recognized the effects of the information age and the revolution in military affairs
(RMA). Germany is closely monitoring C4ISR and other enabling technologies. The army, for
example, is working closely with the U.S. Army in the digitalization of the battlefield. </font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Universal Conscription</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The Bundeswehr has always been a conscript army.
Conscription goes back some 200 years to the Prussian reformers Scharnhorst, Gneisenau,
and von Stein. Conscription is evidence of the citizens&#146; willingness to bear their
share of the responsibility for protecting their community and country. Conscription keeps
the Bundeswehr in close contact with every segment of the population and society,
particularly the younger generation. Conscription not only makes Germany's armed forces
younger, but also enables the Bundeswehr to use the education and skills of all young
German males, be they high school students or skilled and professional laborers, workers,
or farmers. Conscription contributes to German unity, in that young conscripts from the
West are stationed in the new German states in the East and vice versa. There are also two
vital military reasons in favor of maintaining conscription: (1) Mobilization and
augmentation capability is impossible to achieve without conscription, which also produces
a large number of skilled reservists, and (2) universal conscription provides a solid base
for recruitment. The Bundeswehr recruits about 50 percent of its regular officers and NCOs
from its pool of conscripts. Basic military service serves as a kind of orientation
course. It is fair to say that without conscription the quality of military personnel
would drop considerably, because the Bundeswehr would not and could not reach certain
parts of the younger generation. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Ten months of basic military service is followed by
two months of standby readiness. Conscripts normally serve in the MDF, but they can
volunteer for an additional 2-to-13 months service to follow their basic military service.
Volunteers for the RF or for international military peace operations, have to prolong
their service by a couple of months. This has a training aspect, but is even more the
result of a strong belief that conscripts with regular duty obligations should be
responsible only for national or Alliance defense.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Universal conscription and professionalism are not
mutually exclusive; German units with conscripts have proven to be professional and
efficient in exercises, military competitions, and international military peace
operations. For example, German conscript units have won the famous Canadian army trophy
in the armored vehicle competition more frequently than has any other NATO nation. The
same applies to the Boeselager competition for armored reconnaissance troops. In the
evaluation of the Commander, Stabilization Forces (SFOR), German units in Bosnia, also
consisting of conscripts with prolonged time of service, are performing as well as the
units of professional armies in the field.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Given these arguments, German military leaders and
politicians feel strongly about retaining universal conscription.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Training</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The goal of training conscripts to complete their
missions during intensive conventional war under threat of weapons of mass destruction
cannot be entirely achieved during basic military service, but the conscript can be
provided with intensive training up to platoon level. An additional four-to-six months of
training would be provided in times of crisis. To participate in an international military
peace operation, conscripts receive additional special training.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The army is proficient in using simulation,
wargaming procedures, and advanced computer systems. The army training system, which is at
least as good as the one used for training in the U.S. Armed Forces, ranges from
individual tasks to corps assignments. </font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Command and Control</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In wartime, commander-in-chief authority rests with
the German Chancellor, and the German forces are integrated into the NATO command
structure. In peacetime, command and control flows from the Minister of Defense (MOD) to
the army, air force, and navy commands. In international military peace operations, one
service command is designated as the lead command for the forces stationed abroad. To
better enable the MOD to exercise command and control in international military missions,
a Federal Armed Forces Operations Center was established in 1995. Command and control at
the NATO or coalition level will be exercised through a Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF)
headquarters, as is the case with the SFOR in Bosnia.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Multinationality</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Multinationality and the ability to cooperate
effectively have always been structural features of NATO. As a result of the 1991 NATO
summit, integration was shifted from the former army group to corps level.
Multinationality can be seen in several of the corps now stationed in Germany. In addition
to the Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps and the Euro Corps, Germany forms corps
with the United States, the Netherlands, and Denmark. The German-Danish Corps will be the
nucleus of a German-Danish-Polish Corps to be established in Stettin, Poland. This corps
will be of particular benefit to defense and will also help the Poles integrate their
forces into NATO, gain experience in multinational cooperation, restructure their forces
in the next two decades, and quickly acquire the ability to participate in international
military missions. One major concern is that the U.S. military will develop differently
than its allies due to the RMA. Like other European countries, Germany will not have the
funds to acquire the same capabilities and systems as will the United States. What the
Bundeswehr has to do is to maintain its ability to cooperate effectively with the U.S.
Armed Forces.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Expected Future Development</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">When the new German government came to power last
fall, it undertook a broad defense review. A board, called the Future of the Bundeswehr,
will be established this spring and is expected to provide suggestions and recommendations
for future missions, tasks, and force posture of the Bundeswehr. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The necessary restructuring likely will be an
evolutionary rather than a revolutionary process. Germany might improve its capabilities
for crisis reaction, but, for the foreseeable future, the main emphasis will be on
national and Alliance defense, and universal conscription will probably remain in effect.</font></p>
