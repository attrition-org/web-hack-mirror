<h1><font COLOR="#18394C">Preface</font> </h1>

<p>By LIEUTENANT GENERAL RICHARD A. CHILCOAT, U.S. ARMY<br>
President, National Defense University </p>

<p><font COLOR="#702237">O</font>ver the past few years the Department of Defense has been
intensifying its study of the global security situation, U.S. force posture, and future
defense requirements. The National Defense University contributes to this dialogue through
<i>Strategic Assessment,</i> an annual publication which applies the expertise of this
institution through the leadership of its interdisciplinary research arm, the Institute
for National Strategic Studies, with the assistance of specialists from elsewhere in
government and academe. Offering such analyses, in both general and particular areas of
interest to the national security community, is an important aspect of the NDU mission.
This volume examines various approaches that the United States might adopt to shape the
strategic environment of the future. </p>

<p>The current environment is characterized by instability and change. The U.S. Government
needs to apply the full range of options at its disposal to achieve national goals and
ensure the peace and stability required to preserve our rights to &quot;life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.&quot; But such options must be studied and conceptualized for
years (and in some cases, decades) in advance to take advantage of the opportunities
presented by a changing global environment. </p>

<p>The recent Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) recommended a series of defense posture
changes. This volume reviews these recommendations and takes the next analytical step, to
propose what is entailed by such changes. <i>Strategic Assessment 1998: Engaging Power for
Peace</i> should prove useful beyond the defense establishment, to all readers with an
interest in national security affairs. We emphasize that this report is not a statement of
official policy, nor does it represent the views of the Department of Defense or the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Rather than to state policy, the role of National Defense University is
to stimulate discussion and research among both policymakers and analysts. </p>

<h1><font COLOR="#702237">Foreword</font> </h1>

<p>By HANS BINNENDIJK <i>and</i> DAVID C. GOMPERT </p>

<p><big><big><big><font COLOR="#544A48">T</font></big></big></big>his is the fourth volume
in the annual <i>Strategic Assessment </i>series produced by the Institute for National
Strategic Studies at the National Defense University, and undertaken to contribute to the
national effort to understand more clearly the nature of, and the U.S. role in, the new
international system. This volume complements the <i>Strategic Forum</i> series (issue
papers on key national security topics), <i>Joint Force Quarterly</i> (a professional
military journal published for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs), and other titles issued
by INSS. While <i>Strategic</i> <i>Assessment</i> is not an official government
publication, we trust that it will inform and influence policymakers and academics alike. </p>

<p>Each previous volume has had a specific theme. <i>Strategic Assessment 1995: U.S.
Security Challenges in Transition</i> described a new international system which held much
promise and new security concerns for the United States. Some of the first volume's
conclusions were: 

<ul type="square">
  <li>The world is dividing into market democracies, transitional states, and troubled states.
    Market democracies form the core of the U.S. international strength. Transitional states
    will determine the nature of the international system. Troubled states generate many new
    security concerns. </li>
  <li>The most likely conflicts in the emerging system are the least dangerous to U.S.
    security. </li>
  <li>Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is increasingly a current rather than a
    future concern. </li>
  <li>The U.S. domestic focus is limiting our national security capabilities. </li>
  <li>Information technology is displacing heavy industry as the source of national power. </li>
  <li>International organizations are assuming an important legitimizing role, despite their
    limited capabilities. </li>
  <li>Globalization is creating transitional threats as well as benefits. </li>
  <li>To deal with this complex new world, the United States needs to set national security
    priorities--ensure peace among the major powers, engage selectively in regional conflicts,
    respond to transnational threats, and assist failed states. </li>
</ul>

<p><i>Strategic Assessment 1996: Instruments of U.S. Power</i> reviewed 15 different types
of means of exercising U.S. power (ranging from the diplomat in the field to the nuclear
weapon in its silo) and analyzed their capabilities and relevance in the post-Cold War
era. Despite real budget reductions of more than one-third over the previous decade, both
U.S. defense and international affairs instruments were rapidly adapted to meet many of
the new challenges identified in the volume published last year<i>.</i> But the budget
cuts were concentrated in areas like defense procurement and security assistance, which,
if not reversed, could cause lasting damage to our national interests. Some of the
specific conclusions of this second volume were: 

<ul type="square">
  <li>U.S. military forces are currently far more capable, better equipped, and better trained
    than those of any conceivable adversary. The U.S. military stands at a crossroads in
    deciding how much of this capable force it wants to trade in for the kind of stand-off
    precision warfare inherent in the systems-of-systems approach to future warfare. </li>
  <li>U.S. military capabilities are increasingly being used for peacetime engagement and
    peace operations in ways that shape the new strategic environment. These are important
    functions that tend to affect the operations and personnel tempo of a small number of
    units. </li>
  <li>U.S. alliances are shifting to become the cornerstone around which ad hoc coalitions can
    be formed. But the U.S. ability to share its information dominance with allies is not well
    developed and could create problems. </li>
  <li><font COLOR="#0F2D67">T</font>he United States needs to consider reorganizing its
    diplomatic structure. </li>
  <li><font COLOR="#0F2D67">T</font>he United States has been very creative in finding
    alternative ways to fund international security requirements: seeking foreign
    contributions for U.S. initiatives, using old accounts for new purposes, and drawing on
    international organizations for things like weapons inspections. </li>
  <li><font COLOR="#0F2D67">T</font>here is an enhanced role for the private sector in
    national security affairs. Examples include non-governmental organizations in peace
    operations, the news media, and efforts at Track II diplomacy. </li>
  <li><font COLOR="#0F2D67">C</font>loser interagency coordination is needed to make maximum
    use of the resources and instruments of national power. </li>
</ul>

<p><i>Strategic Assessment 1997: Flashpoints and Force Structure </i>categorized key
strategic focal points as major powers, regional contingencies, troubled states, and
transitions problems. The volume concluded that the &quot;two nearly simultaneous Major
Regional Contingencies&quot; concept had become a less useful primary planning scenario
than in 1993. The study suggested a broader basis for the Quadrennial Defense Review
(QDR), and then assessed three alternative force structures. Some specific conclusions
drawn were: 

<ul type="square">
  <li>The United States faces what might be called a strategic lull, but it is nonetheless
    confronted with a more complex and diverse set of smaller threats. It must both deal with
    those threats and take advantage of the strategic lull to exploit the revolution in
    military affairs. </li>
  <li>Russia will be preoccupied with internal economic and political turmoil. Its
    conventional forces have deteriorated rapidly and present no threat, but nuclearization of
    Russia's defense policy should raise concerns. </li>
  <li>China's leadership is focused on domestic politics, but the cultivation of nationalism,
    new energy needs, and rapid economic growth make it a potential theater competitor. </li>
  <li>While both North Korea and Iraq remain dangerous, their conventional military
    capabilities have declined substantially relative to that of the United States. That makes
    more likely their use of weapons of mass destruction, should conflict start. </li>
  <li>Radical Islam will remain a potentially destabilizing factor throughout the Middle East
    and North Africa during the next decade. </li>
</ul>

<p>With regard to force structure alternatives, <i>Strategic Assessment 1997</i> analyzed
the following: 

<ul type="square">
  <li>A recapitalization force model to emphasize procurement and modernization, but at the
    cost of modest force structure reductions. </li>
  <li>An accelerated RMA force model which aggressively implements the system-of-systems, but
    at the cost of major force structure reductions. </li>
  <li>A full spectrum force model which maintains force structure and slowly integrates RMA
    technology, but at the cost of a larger defense budget. </li>
</ul>

<p>No alternative was recommended, but it was clear from the threat analysis that the full
spectrum force model was preferable if the budget financing could be found. </p>

<p>This background was used to prepare<i> Strategic Assessment 1998: Engaging Power for
Peace.</i> Many of the conclusions drawn in earlier volumes in this series found resonance
in the report of the Quadrennial Defense Review, signed by Secretary of Defense William
Cohen in May of 1997. The QDR looked at three military challenges facing the United
States: shaping the strategic environment, responding to aggression, and preparing now for
an uncertain future. It recommended a force structure somewhere between the
recapitalization and full spectrum force models laid out in last year's assessment. This
year's volume is organized under the rubrics of shaping, responding, and preparing, in
order to amplify and extend the QDR conclusions. </p>
