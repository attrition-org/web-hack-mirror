<h2>Research Directorate (RD)</h2>

<p>The research and analysis mission is implemented through the Research Directorate (RD).
RD is structured around six geographic and functional teams, each led by a senior expert.
The Institute's research agenda focuses on analysis of key issues of strategy and policy
that require in-depth research to support senior decisionmakers in OSD, the Joint
Staff,and the CINCs. The studies and analyses typically address questions of strategic
import that have long-term implications for U.S. national security.INSS effectively serves
as the in-house &quot;think tank&quot; for senior Pentagon leadership. As part of the
National Defense University, RD's mission includes providing support to the colleges with
research opportunities, faculty programs and academic fora.</p>

<p>The RD research teams are:</p>
