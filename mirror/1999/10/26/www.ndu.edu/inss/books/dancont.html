<p>The Institute for National Strategic Studies (INSS) is a major component of the
National Defense University (NDU), which operates under the supervision of the President
of NDU. It conducts strategic studies for the Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, and unified commanders in chief; supports national strategic components
of NDU academic programs; and provides outreach to other governmental agencies and the
broader national security community. </p>

<p>The Publication Directorate of INSS publishes books, monographs, reports, and
occasional papers on national security strategy, defense policy, and national military
strategy through NDU Press that reflect the output of NDU research and academic programs.
In addition, it produces the INSS <em>Strategic Assessment</em> and other work approved by
the President of NDU, as well as <em>Joint Force Quarterly</em>, a professional military
journal published for the Chairman. </p>
