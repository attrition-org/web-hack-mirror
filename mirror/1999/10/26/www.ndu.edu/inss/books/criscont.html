the supervision of the president of NDU. It conducts strategic studies for the Secretary
of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), and Unified Commanders in Chief;
supports national strategic components of NDU academic programs; and provides outreach to
other governmental agencies and the broader national security community.</font><font

<p>The Publication Directorate of INSS publishes books, monographs, reports, and
occasional papers on national security strategy, defense policy, and national military
strategy through NDU Press that reflect the output of NDU research and academic programs.
In addition, it produces the INSS <i>Strategic Assessment</i> and other work approved by
the president of NDU, as well as the <i>Joint Forces Quarterly</i>, a professional
military journal published for the chairman of the JCS.</p>

<p>The workshop on which this publication is based was sponsored by the National Defense
University's Institute for National Strategic Studies and the Office of the Assistant
Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (OASD-SOLIC), with
the collaboration of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.</p>
