<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Arial"><b>Most often Asked
Questions</b></font></p>

<p><b><u>What are the student eligibility criteria?</u></b></p>

<p>The National Defense University does not have an open
admissions policy. Students are sent to NDU by the military
service or federal government agency they work for. The NDU
experience is part of their professional development and will
prepare them for strategic-level assignments. To attend NDU, the
student must be at least a Lieutenant Colonel or Commander if
they are military officers. If they are government employees,
they must be at least a GS-14. Although the great majority of the
students have earned advanced degrees prior to attending, at a
minimum, the must hold a baccalaureate degree.</p>

<p><b><u>How do I apply for admission?</u></b></p>

<p>Unfortunately the National Defense University programs are
only open to Department of Defense employees, and other federal
agencies that support national security. Each of the military
services nominate active duty and reserve members in the grade of
O-5 (LtCol/CDR) or O-6 (Col/CAPT) to attend the different
colleges. The federal government nominations are limited to
personnel in the grade of GS-14 and above. In essence, the
university does not have an open admissions policy. </p>

<p><b><u>Do you accept foreign students?</u></b></p>

<p>The university does have an International Fellows program.
However, these are senior-level military officers, who attend
under special invitation from the Chairman of the Joint Chief of
Staff. Again, we do not have an open admissions policy for
international students; their country must be officially invited
to participate in our programs.</p>

<p><b><u>Can I take your courses by correspondence?</u></b></p>

<p>We no longer offer a correspondence course. Unfortunately the
nonresident National Security Management Correspondence Program
was discontinued in September of 1992. Please disregard any
reference to it in training publications made available through
the Services. Military officers interested in correspondence
courses should contact their personnel officer for information on
other programs offered through the Services.</p>

<p><b><u>Is the university accredited?</u></b></p>

<p>The National Defense University is accredited by the Middle
States Association of Colleges and Schools. </p>

<p><font size="5">RE: Accreditation Questions</font></p>

<p><b><u>Which classes are affected by the accreditation?</u></b></p>

<p>The NDU granted the first master degrees to the ICAF, NWC and
SIWS students from the class of 1994. On 15 November, 1994, the
Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (MSA) conferred
on NDU the status of &quot;Candidate for Accreditation.&quot; The
MSA policy firmly states that they will only accredit degrees
from that point forward. Therefore, <b>students who graduated in
1995 are the first to hold accredited degrees. </b></p>

<p><b><u>Will degrees be grandfathered back to earlier years?</u></b></p>

<p><b>No.</b> Unfortunately, there has been a great deal of
confusion and misinformation regarding this issue. According to
the President&#146;s files, the initial request made by the
university was for degree-granting authority for the period of
1990 forward. However, when the legislation was signed it
specifically stated that the university was not allowed to grant
degrees until they had begun the process for accreditation with
the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.</p>

<p><b><u>How does an officer get their service to reflect the
degree?</u></b></p>

<p>The university forwarded transcripts to the services for the
military officers who graduated with the class of 1995, 1996, and
1997. <b>It is not necessary for the officers to make a request</b>.
</p>

<p><b><u>What does this mean to IRMC&#146;s AMP students?</u></b></p>

<p>Although the AMP students are not in one of the university's
degree granting programs, <b>they will certainly benefit
indirectly from the accreditation</b>. The university is
accredited as a whole, therefore, it has been awarded the
&quot;blessing&quot; of passing a very thorough peer review which
sanctions it's programs in the eyes of the academic community.
The IRMC has cooperative agreements with both Syracuse University
and University of Maryland. The university's initial
accreditation augments those agreements, and makes a stronger
case for AMP courses to receive transfer credit to other
programs.</p>

<p><b><u>How does a student request a transcript?</u></b></p>

<p>The university's policy for transcript release is in
compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
(FERPA) of 1974. Students must make a written request through the
registrar's office. For the military student's convenience,
following commencement, the registrar will forward transcripts to
the appropriate service and request that the degree be entered
into the officer's formal record. With this exception, under no
circumstances will a transcript be released to a third party
without the student's written permission. <b>A transcript request
must include the following information:</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="WP Greek Century"><b>Full name</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="WP Greek Century"><b>College attended </b></font></p>
