<hr>

<p align="left"><strong>Organized in 1982, the Foundation is a
non-profit, tax exempt organization classified under paragraph
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. It establishes private
sector support through grants and donations to enhance NDU's
teaching and research capabilities in ways not made available
through government appropriations.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>These enhancements involve rotating
research and teaching functions, chairs and fellowships,
seminars, conferences and other specialized means to enrich the
academic ambience commensurate with what is expected of a
prestigious university.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>The President and other officials of the
University are prohibited by law from soliciting funds from
outside sources to meet these special needs. The Foundation was
created as an independent, non-military entity to raise funds to
support the NDU programs as described above.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>The Foundation directors are patriotic
citizens who serve without compensation and devote their effort
to help the NDU to enhance its level of EXCELLENCE IN NATIONAL
SECURITY EDUCATION.</strong></p>
