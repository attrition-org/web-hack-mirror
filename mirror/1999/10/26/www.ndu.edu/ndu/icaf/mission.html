  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>The mission of the Industrial College of the Armed Forces
  (ICAF) is to prepare selected military officers and civilians for senior
  leadership and staff positions by conducting postgraduate, executive-level
  courses of study and associated research dealing with the resource component
  of national power, with special emphasis on materiel acquisition and joint
  logistics, and their integration into national security strategy for peace
  and war. Reflecting this joint and interagency perspective, 67 percent
  of the student body is composed of military representatives from the land,
  sea and air Services, 25 percent from the Departments of Defense and State
  and 10 other federal agencies, 7 percent international military officers,
  and 1 percent from the private sector. ICAF awards its graduates a Master
  of Science degree in National Resource Strategy. In addition, at the direction
  of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology [USD (A&amp;T)],
  ICAF serves as the course provider for the Senior Acquisition Course directed
  by the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act. In this capacity,
  ICAF acts as a consortium college of the Defense Acquisition University
  (DAU). Both the USD (A&amp;T) and DAU provide oversight of the Senior Acquisition
  Course to ensure its relevance to acquisition personnel as the highest
  level acquisition course in the Department of Defense.</FONT></P>

    <DT><FONT SIZE=-1>The Commandant of ICAF is a two-star general or flag

    to the President of the National Defense University. As a joint sponsor
    of the ICAF, the Department of State nominates a Foreign Service officer
    with ambassadorial rank to serve as the Commandant&iacute;s International
    Adviser. The Dean of Faculty and Academic Programs is responsible for all
    matters related to faculty, teaching, professional development, curriculum
    planning and scheduling, and faculty and student research. The Dean of
    Students and Administration coordinates student activities and responsibilities,
    provides administrative and logistics support to the College and provides
    liaison with counterpart offices of the National Defense University. </FONT>

    <DT><FONT SIZE=-1>The faculty is composed of permanent Department of the
    Army civilian academicians, active duty military from all Services, and
    visiting senior civilians from diverse federal government agencies. Civilian
    faculty members are academic specialists or are practitioners selected
    from nominations by their respective agencies. Military faculty members
    normally hold the rank of Colonel/Captain and are specialists in their
    fields.</FONT>
