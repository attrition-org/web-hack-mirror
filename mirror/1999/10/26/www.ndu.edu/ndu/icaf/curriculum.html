      <p><b>CURRICULUM</b></p>
      <hr ALIGN="LEFT">
      <font SIZE="-1"><p>The Industrial Collage of the Armed Forces is the nationís only
      educational institution that emphasizes the management of national resources to support
      national security strategy. The ICAF curriculum provides a broad education in national
      security strategy and national military strategy with the major emphasis on resources
      management. The ICAFís academic program is specifically designed for a student body
      already highly experienced and successful in military and civilian professions devoted to
      the design and resourcing the different facets of national security. All ICAF students
      have achieved the ranks of Colonel/Captain, Lieutenant Colonel/Commander or the civilian
      equivalent in the Department of State, other federal agencies and the private sector.</font></p>
      <p><font SIZE="-1">The College's approach to education focuses on broad-based national
      security decision making for senior policy makers in a dynamic world environment. The
      academic program emphasizes postgraduate, executive-level education rather than training,
      and enduring principles and concepts rather than transient contemporary events. ICAF
      focuses on enhancing the ability of its students to think strategicallyóto have strategic
      vision, develop strategic plans, lead at strategic levels, take critical advantage of the
      information revolution, and create<br>
      environments that put the highest value on consideration of others and ethical behavior.
      Intrinsic to this is the internalization of a joint, interagency perspective and a broad
      education that places national security decisions in the context of historical, political,
      social, economic, and military trends. During the first half of their studies, the
      students study grand strategy and development of a national security strategy. The second
      half of the yearís program builds upon this foundation by studying the resource component
      of national security strategyóthe issues, players, policies, and processes in the public
      and private sectors and the linkages between the two. Underlying all of the core studies
      throughout the year are the themes of ethics, consideration of others, information
      dominance, and writing. The Commandant has instituted a program that explicitly brings
      these threads to the forefront as well as intrinsically weaves them in appropriate core
      lesson objectives.</font></p>
      <p><font SIZE="-1">The curriculum consists of interrelated courses presented in a balanced
      mix of seminars, lectures and field studies. Structured to emphasize active learning, the
      curriculum employs the case-study method, complemented by extensive student reading,
      written and oral presentations, classroom analysis, lectures by faculty members and
      prominent outside authorities, and a field study program. This integrated program of
      activities provides intellectual rigor.</font></p>
      <p><font SIZE="-1">An integral part of the learning process is assessment and feedback.
      During the course of the year, faculty advisors and instructors evaluate each provide
      feedback on performance and potential across a full spectrum of academic activities.</font></p>
      <p><font SIZE="-1">The student body is composed of a balance of military operators (30
      percent), military resource managers and technical personnel (45 percent), as well as
      civilians (25 percent). They receive full coverage of the joint professional military
      education requirements and satisfy the legislative education requirement for Joint
      Specialty Officers upon graduation. Thus, the Collegeís graduates are unique among senior
      officials in that they are knowledgeable in both strategic planning and resource
      management.</font></p>
      <p><font SIZE="-1">ICAF strives to provide an environment that reflects NDU and ICAF
      values, encourages multidisciplinary thought and discussion, promotes presentation of
      subject matter, enhances cooperation between academic disciplines, encourages free
      discussion among students, faculty, and staff, and creates a climate of contribution and
      mutual assistance. The ICAF continues to influence, upgrade, and expand, through research,
      publication, and outreach, that body of knowledge affecting national security strategy,
      national military strategy, and national resource strategy as required by the ICAF
      mission.<br>
