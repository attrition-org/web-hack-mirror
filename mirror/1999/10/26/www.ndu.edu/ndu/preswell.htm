    <td width="315" align="left" valign="middle">Welcome to the Home Page of the National
    Defense University (NDU), our nation's premier joint military education institution. On
    this page and its component links, you'll find a continually expanding body of
    information: outlines of curricula at our constituent colleges; research and publications
    by our faculty and students; and information on upcoming symposia, conferences, seminars,
    and workshops involving the University. Our NDU Library's link includes both a searchable
    index of its holdings and connections to a host of other related web sites. On its link,
    NDU's Institute for National Strategic Studies (INSS) provides online publication of the
    annual &quot;Strategic Assessment&quot; and periodic &quot;Strategic Forums&quot;. </td>

    <td height="282">We hope that this home page, and those like it in the Professional
    Military Education<br>
    community, offer both the medium and the message of the information age. There is now
    little<br>
    doubt that the Internet, and its World-Wide Web in particular, has become an important,<br>
    worldwide vehicle for the information explosion. As for the message, we will make every<br>
    effort to provide a relevant, growing, and elastic information resource on these pages
    that is of<br>
    real value to our students, present and past, and to all others with a genuine interest in<br>
    professional military education and research. <p>Perhaps no single factor has so much
    potential for changing the nature of how military<br>
    organizations function, during peace and war, as the information explosion. By making<br>
    unprecedented amounts of information immediately available in easy-to-use forms at<br>
    diminishing costs, the emerging &quot;information highway&quot; will certainly alter
    society, to say nothing<br>
    of military conflict. This home page is part of our effort at NDU to keep pace with this<br>
    ubiquitous, rapidly evolving phenomena with enormous consequences for the way we live --<br>
    and fight.</p>
