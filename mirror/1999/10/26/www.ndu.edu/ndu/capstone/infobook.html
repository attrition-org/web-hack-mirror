  <P><A NAME="anchor86820"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Course Background </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>On 26 May 1982, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) directed
  the National Defense University (NDU) to establish a professional military
  education program for general and flag officer selectees. Two pilot programs
  were offered in 1983, and in February 1984, JCS approved a permanent annual
  CAPSTONE course of eight weeks in duration. In July 1986, the JCS reduced
  the course length to six weeks and increased the frequency to two courses
  per year. Beginning in 1987, four CAPSTONE courses a year were conducted
  to satisfy the statutory requirement of the DOD Reorganization Act of 1986--that
  all newly selected general/flag officers attend the CAPSTONE course. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>CAPSTONE participants are referred to as &quot;Fellows&quot;
  because of the unique nature of the course and the special expertise and
  qualifications of those officers attending. The course differs from senior
  service schools in three major ways, other than the obvious rank of its
  participants, class size and course duration. First, the course focuses
  on the employment of U.S. forces in joint and combined operations to support
  national policy objectives. Second, it provides personal interaction with
  Commanders in Chief (CINCs) and other senior U.S. commanders. Third, retired
  four-star general and flag officers are attached to each class as Senior<BR>
  Fellows to provide advice and guidance. </FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor95867"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Course Focus </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Education at the general/flag officer level is inherently
  joint and unified in nature. Its focus is on the highest levels of strategy,
  integrating the elements of national power to achieve national security
  objectives. In particular, the CAPSTONE course reinforces new general/flag
  officer comprehension of joint matters and national security strategy needed
  for the remainder of an officer's career. </FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor96597"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>3. Course Mission </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>The mission of this general/flag officer course is for
  participants to review how the elements of national power are integrated
  to achieve national security objectives. </FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor98269"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Learning Objectives </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>The overall objectives of general/flag officer education
  are listed below. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>a. Examine key aspects of unified, joint, and multinational
  operations. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>b. Examine key aspects of the national security environment,
  the intelligence support structure, joint and Service doctrines and capabilities,
  integration of battlespace systems, joint and combined operational concepts,
  and planning processes. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>c. Examine force acquisition issues, current defense programs,
  industrial base issues<BR>
  and concepts, and their implications in the conduct of unified, joint,
  and multinational<BR>
  operations. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>d. Integrate and synchronize national military strategy
  with national security strategy and policy. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>e. Examine the relationship between Congress and the military,
  principal<BR>
  military-related congressional committees, and legislative liaison and
  testimony<BR>
  procedures.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>f. Understand current force protection/Risk Management
  issues.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor98619"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>5. Course Methodology </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>The CAPSTONE course is presented in four general ways:
  </FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Classroom seminars address the understanding of the U.S.
  defense community, key issues affecting national security and current problems
  facing today's senior leaders. These are provided through classroom presentations
  by current and former senior leaders, former CINCs, civilian leaders, military
  critics, student-led discussions, and a crisis decision exercise.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Local area studies are conducted to achieve an understanding
  of principal national security agencies in the Washington area. Fellows
  visit the National Security Council, Department of State, Central Intelligence
  Agency, all Service headquarters (including the U.S. Coast Guard) and the
  Joint Staff. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>CONUS field studies are conducted to ensure Fellows understand
  the Unified Commands headquartered in the United States and the combat
  capabilities of the military services. Discussions with the CINCs and hands-on
  demonstrations of major warfighting systems are included in this portion
  of the course. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Overseas field studies offer the opportunity to explore
  theater/regional security concerns, U.S. and allied/friendly nation capabilities
  and theater training and preparation for war. The class is divided into
  three groups for travel: Europe, the Pacific and the Western Hemisphere.
  Discussions with CINCs, ambassadors and other senior foreign military leaders
  on joint planning and operations, warfighting capabilities, and key issues
  facing the commands and regions highlight this phase of the course. </FONT>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><A NAME="anchor99090"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>6. Course Context </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>The course requires intensive personal involvement on
  the part of each CAPSTONE Fellow through participation in or leadership
  of seminars, field trips, discussions, and the current issues exercise.
  There are many opportunities for each Fellow to share expertise and experiences
  with other participants. The CAPSTONE course does not include formal writing
  or research assignments. Readings are modest in scope and are offered to
  illuminate the issues under discussion. Fellows do present a group overview
  of their overseas field studies.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor99428"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>7. Senior Fellows </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Senior Fellows are retired four-star general and flag
  officers who participate in the CAPSTONE program and provide a unique dimension
  to the course. Their breadth of experience, gained in both peace and war
  and in a variety of military and politically sensitive positions, qualifies
  them to serve as role models, to interpret events and issues, and to provide
  insights not readily available from other sources. Senior Fellows are a
  valuable teaching resource and occasionally lecture. Their principal contribution
  to the course, however, lies in their day-to-day contact with CAPSTONE
  participants. </FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor99727"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>8. 1999 course Schedule </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Four CAPSTONE courses are scheduled during 1998. The dates
  are: </FONT></P>

  <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor283938"></A><B>POLICIES </B></CENTER></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor115789"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Nonattribution Policy
  </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Presentations by guest speakers, seminar leaders and panelists,
  including renowned public officials and scholars, constitute an important
  part of the curricula of the National Defense University. To allow the
  guests (as well as faculty and other University officials) the latitude
  to speak candidly, the University offers its assurance that their presentations
  will be held in strict confidence. This assurance derives from a policy
  of nonattribution which is morally binding on all who attend. Without the
  expressed permission of the speaker, nothing he or she says will be attributed
  to him or her directly or indirectly in the presence of anyone who was
  not authorized to attend the presentation. This policy is not to inhibit
  students and faculty within the academic environment from discussing the
  opinions and views expressed by speakers. However, the nonattribution policy
  precludes citing the views and opinions of one guest (even if he is not
  identified by name) when questioning subsequent speakers. It also precludes
  individuals from taping lectures. </FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor116195"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Excusal Policy</FONT></B><FONT
   SIZE=-1> </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>The DOD Reorganization Act of 1986 requires that all active
  duty general and flag officers attend CAPSTONE. The Secretary of Defense
  may waive attendance for: </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>a. An officer whose immediately previous assignment was
  a joint duty assignment </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>b. When necessary for the good of the Service </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>c. An officer whose selection for promotion is based primarily
  upon scientific and technical qualifications for which joint requirements
  do not exist </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>d. Medical, dental, veterinary, medical service, and biomedical
  science officers, nurses and chaplains </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Waivers must be requested by the Service headquarters
  to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. Requests for short individual
  absences during the course are subject to approval by the President, National
  Defense University. </FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor116549"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>3. Security Clearance Policy
  </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>All Fellows and Senior Fellows participating in CAPSTONE
  must have appropriate U.S., NATO, and SCI security clearances. Although
  much of the course's written material and discussion will be of an unclassified
  nature, there will be frequent occasions when discussion will involve sensitive
  areas. All are reminded of their responsibility to properly safeguard classified
  material and not to discuss classified information, particularly SCI, in
  other than appropriately cleared facilities. Classified notes and readings
  will be kept in storage facilities in the CAPSTONE area. (See Section C,
  paragraph 2 for further </FONT>information on security clearances.)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor116689"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Building Security Policy
  </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>All entrances to university buildings are equipped with
  electronic security devices and are monitored by closed circuit television.
  Each CAPSTONE Fellow will be issued a security badge/electronic entry card
  during in-processing on day one of the course.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor117026"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>5. Smoking Policy </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>As stipulated in DOD Instruction 6015.8, 18 August 1977,
  smoking will not be allowed in classroom sessions in Washington nor during
  field visits. </FONT></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor286258"></A><B>ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION</B></CENTER></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor429818"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>1. In-Processing </FONT></B></P>

  in the CAPSTONE classroom, Eisenhower Hall (Building 59), Room 280, Fort
  McNair, Washington, DC on day one of the course. Please bring the following
  items with you on the first day: </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Copy of TDY orders (needed for in-processing) Official
  Passport Personal Check in the amount of $650.00, payable to &quot;CAPSTONE&quot;
  (needed for in-processing) </FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor39090"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Security Clearance Requirements
  </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Please ensure that you pass the NDU Form 12 (Enclosure
  to your welcome letter) to your local security office. Instructions are
  included on proper completion and disposition of the form. All Fellows
  must possess a Top Secret clearance and be eligible for SCI access. Certification
  of SCI clearances must be transmitted by your security office. Additional
  information regarding security clearances required can be obtained through
  our security office at (202) 685-3765.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor43314"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>3. Passports</FONT></B><FONT
   SIZE=-1> </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>All military personnel who attend CAPSTONE must have a
  valid official (burgundy) passport that does not expire until at least
  six months after completion of the course. Likewise, civilians attending
  CAPSTONE must have a valid passport that does not expire until six months
  after completion of the course. If you do not have a valid official passport,
  or it does not meet the expiration date requirements mentioned above, you
  must take action immediately to either obtain one or renew your existing
  passport. For those Fellows who must apply for official passports, you
  must do so at your current locaton. Please ensure that you follow the instructions
  provided in your welcome letter. Also, please fax a copy of your passport
  application to CAPSTONE at: (202) 685-4256 or DSN 325-4256. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Passports will be collected during during the first day
  after visa applications are filled out.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor43752"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Travel </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Transportation will be provided from Ft. McNair for local
  travel within Washington, D.C. and extended travel throughout the CONUS
  and overseas. Travel within the Washington, D.C. area (5 days) is via military
  bus. Travel in CONUS (10 days) and overseas (15 days) via military air.
  </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>The University does not provide transportation to and
  from billeting to Fort McNair. It is recommended that those out-of-town
  Fellows who do not drive their privately owned vehicles to Washington include
  rental car authorization on their TDY orders from home station. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Fellows not stationed in the Washington, D.C. area must
  make individual travel arrangements from their duty location to Washington
  and return, and must also make individual rental car arrangements. (See
  paragraph 7 in this section for further information on rental cars.) </FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor44235"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>5. Financial </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>At in-processing, you will be asked to write a check for
  $650.00, payable to &quot;CAPSTONE.&quot; These funds will cover the cost
  of refreshments, group meals and other miscellaneous expenses. The actual
  cost for these items varies from class to class, and from location to location
  on the overseas field studies portion of the course. Fellows whose individual
  expenses are less than $650.00 will receive a refund at the end of the
  course. Conversely, those whose expenses exceed $650.00 will be asked to
  remit additional payment. A full accounting of expenses will be provided
  to each Fellow at the end of the course. </FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor5095"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>6. Billeting </FONT></B><FONT
   SIZE=-1>(non-Washington, D.C. area residents only) </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>CAPSTONE Fellows are normally billeted at the Doubletree
  Guest Suites, 100 South Reynolds Street, Alexandria, Virginia (Reservations:
  Ms. Teresa Harris @ (703) 370-9600). Make your reservations directly with
  the Doubletree. NDU will pay the lodging costs for CAPSTONE Fellows who
  stay at the Doubletree. Also, spouses attending the CAPSTONE Spouses<BR>
  Course during Week 6 of CAPSTONE may stay at the Doubletree with the member
  at no additional charge. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>CAPSTONE Fellows who choose to stay at a location other
  than the Doubletree will be required to pay for their lodging and will
  be reimbursed at the government rate. Additionally, arrangements must be
  made for baggage storage while traveling outside the local area (approximately
  3 1/2 out of the 6 weeks). Dual lodging is not authorized. </FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor5584"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>7. Rental Cars</FONT></B><FONT
   SIZE=-1> (non-Washington, D.C. area residents only) </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>If you will be using a rental car while attending CAPSTONE,
  you must obtain the authorization for funding for the rental car from your
  own unit, as the National Defense University will not reimburse you for
  rental car expenses while attending the course. We recommend that you<BR>
  use one of the rental car companies listed below to enable you to easily
  return and pick up cars as you depart and return from CAPSTONE travel.
  Travel on the CAPSTONE trips is via military air departing and arriving
  through Andrews AFB (AAFB), and these companies service the base. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Wash Nat'l # Andrews AFB # Dulles # </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Thrifty (703) 658-2200 (301) 568-7900 (703)471-4544<BR>
  Enterprise (703) 553-7744 (301) 868-8881 (703)<BR>
  478-2300 </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>The following example illustrates the procedures used
  when picking up and returning a rental car at different locations. If you
  are arriving at National Airport initially, for example, call the Washington
  National Airport number for Thrifty or Enterprise and tell the reservations
  clerk that you wish to pick a car up at National Airport but return it
  to AAFB &quot;DV Lounge&quot; on the date you depart on CONUS travel (see
  your draft schedule for the departure date). You should make subsequent
  reservations to pick a car up at AAFB &quot;DV Lounge&quot; (upon return
  from the CONUS and overseas trips) through the company&#146;s AAFB number.
  For your final reservation (on return from the overseas trip), tell the
  rental car clerk at AAFB that you wish to pick the car up at AAFB &quot;DV
  Lounge&quot; and return it to National Airport on the date you are flying
  back to your permanent duty station.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor6272"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>8. Parking and Driving on
  Ft. McNair</FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Parking spaces for CAPSTONE Fellows are reserved in the
  area directly in front of the National War College, Building 61, Roosevelt
  Hall, and also along 4th Avenue. Your parking permit is enclosed with your
  welcome letter. Please display your parking permit so that it can be seen
  through your windshield. If the car you will be driving does not have a
  DOD decal, please allow a few extra minutes on your first day to obtain
  a temporary vehicle pass from the Fort McNair Provost Marshal. The guard
  at the entrance to Fort McNair will assist you in this. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>The speed limit on Fort McNair is 20 miles per hour and
  speed check points are regularly in operation. Speeding fines are a minimum
  of $25.00. Parking regulations are strictly enforced by both the Fort McNair
  Provost Marshal and the District of Columbia Department of Transportation.
  Persons ticketed for parking in unauthorized areas are subject to a fine
  of $25.00. </FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor6628"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>9. TDY Orders </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>National Defense University's Resource Management Division
  will provide fund citations to CAPSTONE. We will, in turn, fax the information
  to you for publication of your orders by your unit. (This does not apply
  to those whose attendance isfunded by their own components or units.)</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor6996"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>10. Travel Claims </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>CAPSTONE will provide Fellows with travel vouchers to
  facilitate processing travel claims. Fellows stationed outside the Washington,
  DC area will submit one travel voucher to cover the entire TDY period.
  It will be completed upon return to home station and mailed back to NDU.
  (Express Mail envelopes will be provided with the vouchers.) Fellows stationed
  in the Washington, DC area will complete two vouchers (one for CONUS travel
  and one for overseas travel) and submit them to the CAPSTONE staff upon
  completion of that travel. NDU's Resource Management Division will forward
  the travel claims to DFAS for settlement and payment will be deposited
  to the account of your choosing. Reserve/Guard attendees, and select active-duty
  attendees in each class are funded for attendance by their own units or
  parent Service. These personnel will be advised to submit their claims
  to their units or parent Service. </FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor7356"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>11. Staff Support </FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>CAPSTONE is supported by a fairly small staff. As a result,
  the individualized support that can be provided to each Fellow is limited.
  We will support you to the best of our abilities, but it may<BR>
  not be to the degree you receive from your own staff. <BR>

  well received by previous classes is the Health Assessment. Each Fellow
  may voluntarily obtain an unofficial and strictly confidential individualized
  health assessment. The program consists of a blood chemistry test, a treadmill
  stress test, a lecture on health maintenance, and a one-on-one consultation
  with the University's Director of Health Fitness. It results in a suggested
  dietary and exercise prescription based upon individual data. A briefing
  on this program is scheduled during week one of the course. </FONT></P>
