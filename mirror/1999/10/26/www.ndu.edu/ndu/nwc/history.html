<p>The National War College was officially established on I July 1946 as
an upgraded replacement for the Army-Navy Staff College (June 1943 - July
1946). According to Lieutenant General Leonard T. Gerow, President of the
Board which recommended its formation,<b> "The College is concerned with
grand strategy and the utilization of the national resources necessary
to implement that strategy... Its graduates will exercise a great influence
on the formulation of national and foreign policy in both peace and war..."
</b>This theme is underscored with the inclusion of State Department, DoD,
and other interagency representatives on the faculty and in the student
body.
<p>American experience in 20<sup>th</sup> Century wars has repeatedly shown
that the complexity of planning and conducting global war plus joint and
combined military operations required officers and civilians in government,
inter-agencies, industry, and non-governmental organizations to be thoroughly
familiar with each other's roles, functions, and missions. They also needed
the skills to operate comfortably at levels in which key national security
and strategy decisions would be made in peace and war. Since its inception,
the National War College has proven invaluable in preparing its students
for those responsibilities.
<p>The College is located in Theodore Roosevelt Hall on Fort Lesley J.
McNair, the oldest active Army Post in existence today. Established near
the confluence of th Anacostia and Potomac rivers, it was originally designed
to protect Washington from river invasions. Later, it was the site of the
trial and subsequent hanging of four co-conspirators associated with President
Lincoln's assassination. On 21 February 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt
laid the cornerstone to the building which now bears his name. The building
has been home to the Army War College (1903 - 1917, 1919 - 1940), War Plans
Division, War Department General Staff, Selective Service System Headquarters,
Headquarters U.S. Army Ground Forces (all successively during World War
II), and the National War College (1946 - present). The first National
War College class met on 1 September 1946. One hundred American and six
foreign observers attended the school. In June 1974, this unique structure
was designated a National Historic Landmark. Extensive renovations to Roosevelt
Hall are scheduled to begin in February 1988. The Coast Guard Headquarters
Building (Transpoint) located at Buzzard Point in S.W. Washington, D.C.
will be the relocation site for the College during the renovation period.
<p>To date, over 7,500 students have graduated form the College. The number
of U.S. and international graduates who have been promoted to the top of
their services or civilian agencies of the government is an indicator of
the importance of the National War College, but its most profound effect
has been on individual thinking and intellectual growth.
