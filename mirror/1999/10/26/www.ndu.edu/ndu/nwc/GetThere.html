The National War College is located on Fort Lesley J. McNair, at 4th and
P Streets, SW, in Washington D.C. You will need proper identification to
get past the gate guards. The speed limit on post is 20mph and is rigidly
enforced, so please drive carefully. The College itself is in Roosevelt
Hall, Building 61 (pictured above).
<p><b><font size=+1>Directions from Virginia:</font></b>
<p>Coming north on Route 95, cross the 14th Street Bridge. (If you are
in the HOV lanes, keep to your right and follow the sign towards 12th Street.
You will then merge with the non-HOV lanes.) Once across the bridge, avoid
the 12th Street exit, then take the next right exit to Maine Avenue. This
puts you onto 9th st. Proceed through the stop sign, then get into the
left lane before the light. Turn left at the light onto Maine Avenue--in
a few blocks, this road will turn into M Street. After several blocks you
will come to 4th Street (a Safeway grocery store will be to your left).
Take a right onto 4th Street. After going straight for a few blocks, it
will curve around to the left. Immediately after the curve, turn right
into Fort McNair.

<p><b><font size=+1>Once on Post:</font></b>
<p>Dim your headlights when turning into the Fort McNair gate and await
the guard's directions. The speed limit on post is 20mph and is rigidly
enforced, so please drive carefully. Once cleared to proceed, drive straight
ahead until you reach a "T" junction (about 100 meters). Turn left. You
will pass a one-way street on your right, then turn right at the next intersection.
You will pass a number of large buildings. After about 500 meters you will
see Roosevelt Hall (the NWC, pictured at the top of this page) off to your
right. Proceed into the parking lot ahead of you and to the left of Roosevelt
Hall. Please park in an unreserved space. Welcome to the National War College!
