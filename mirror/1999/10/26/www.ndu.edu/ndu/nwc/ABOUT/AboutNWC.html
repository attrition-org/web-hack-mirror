<p><font color="#000000">NWC's mission is to prepare future leaders of
the Armed Forces, State Department, and other civilian agencies for high-level
policy, command, and staff responsibilities by conducting a senior-level
course of study in national security strategy and national security policy
process.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The <b>National War College</b> conducts a senior-level
course of study in national security policy and strategy to prepare selected
military officers and federal officials for high-level policy, command
and staff responsibilities. The National War College focuses on national
security policy and strategy, and emphasizes the joint and interagency
perspective. Reflecting this emphasis, 75 percent of the student body is
composed of equal representation from the land, sea (including Marine and
Coast Guard), and air Services, with the remaining 25 percent drawn from
the Department of State and other federal departments and agencies. In
addition, international fellows from a number of countries join the student
body. The Commandant, a military officer of two-star rank, occupies a nominative
position that rotates among the Army, Navy, and Air Force. As joint sponsor
of the National War College, the Department of State nominates a foreign
service officer with Ambassadorial rank to serve as the Commandant's International
Affairs Adviser. The Dean of Faculty and Academic programs is responsible
for all matters related to faculty, teaching, professional development,
curriculum planning and scheduling, as well as for faculty and student
research.</font>
<p><a NAME="27 Propositions"></a><b><font color="#000000">27 PROPOSITIONS
THAT DEFINE THE CORE CURRICULUM</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">An Address from the Dean before the Alumni Association,
6 June 1997. The mission of the National War College is to "prepare future
leaders of the Armed Forces, State Department, and other civilian agencies
for high-level policy, command, and staff responsibilities by conducting
a senior level course of study in national security strategy." The critical
parts of that mission statement are, first, the charge to prepare future
leaders, which the College interprets to mean not training our graduates
for their next assignments but rather educating them to think critically
and creatively about the national security problems they will confront
in their ultimate assignments.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Second, the mission charges the College to prepare
students from all the Armed Forces, the State Department, and other civilian
agencies, which means the College’s program must be thoroughly joint and
interagency. Finally, the College is charged with conducting a senior level
course of study in national security strategy, which entails orchestrating
all the instruments of national power to achieve national objectives.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Given this mission, the College has developed
a sequenced, focused core curriculum that leads students through a critical
analysis of the essential issues in both the theory and practice of national
security strategy. That core curriculum takes a building block approach,
with each block building on its predecessor and then adding to the foundation
for its successor, and with the entire core moving from the theoretical
to the practical and from the general to the specific. The five courses
that make up the core address the fundamentals of statecraft, the nature
and conduct of war, the national security policy process, the geostrategic
context, and the development and implementation of national military strategy.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Below are twenty-seven propositions, extracted
in paraphrase from the five core course syllabi, that capture the fundamental
essence of that core curriculum. While not all-inclusive, they indicate
the principal themes and concepts that characterize a National War College
education.</font>
<p><a NAME="Fundamentals"></a><b><font color="#000000">Fundamentals of
Statecraft:</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">1. What is national security; what is the overarching
aim of our efforts? In the words of Arnold Wolfers, "Security, in an objective
sense, measures the absence of threats to acquired values; in a subjective
sense, [it measures] the absence of fear that such values will be attacked."
National security also is multi-dimensional; it has not only a military
dimension, but also economic, political, diplomatic, and social dimensions.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">2. Achieving security requires a plan, a strategy.
And with respect to formulating strategy, we promote the views of Henry
Kissinger: "The most difficult challenge for a policymaker in foreign affairs
is to establish priorities. A conceptual framework -- which links events
-- is an essential tool." In keeping with that sentiment, we offer students
a conceptual framework for analyzing strategic problems. That framework
is depicted in the accompanying schematic.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">3. A key element in strategic analysis at the
national level is ordering your ideas about the shape and operation of
the international system. American strategists have generally fallen into
two more or less distinct schools. The realism/realpolitik school emphasizes
geopolitics, which looks at the distribution of power among the world's
nation states, and the balance of power among those nation states. The
idealism/moralism school emphasizes broad, transnational interactions and
relationships among both state and non-state actors, and a vision of a
more peaceful, more moral world order rooted in collective security. Neither
of these schools is wholly sufficient in and of itself, but together they
offer two useful, fundamental perspectives.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">4. As Nietszhe observed, the most common form
of human stupidity is becoming so involved in doing something that you
forget what you're trying to do. In foreign affairs this equates to defining
national interests and objectives, but this is no simple task. Bernard
Brodie pointed out that "The perennial problem for the leaders of a superpower
like the United States is to determine the outer boundaries of what is
truly vital." At the same time, the strategist must respect Cordell Hull's
assertion that "Since the time when Thomas Jefferson insisted upon a decent
respect to the opinions of mankind, public opinion has controlled foreign
policy in all democracies." Defining interests, and objectives for advancing
those interests, is an extraordinarily difficult and complex task.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">5. According to Walter Lippmann, "a foreign policy
consists in bringing into balance, with a comfortable surplus of power
in reserve, the nation's commitments and the nation's power" -- in other
words, matching ends to means. Invariably this brings us around to economics,
for while we talk of multiple elements of national power, all are inextricably
entwined with economics. As President Clinton has stated, "America must
regain its economic strength to play our proper role as leader of the world.
An anemic, debt-ridden economy undermines our diplomacy, makes it harder
for us to secure favorable trade agreements, and compromises our ability
to finance essential military actions."</font>
<p><font color="#000000">6. Given a clear vision of national interests
and objectives, and the ability to mobilize the necessary power, statecraft
boils down to devising ways (strategies) to use available and appropriate
means (instruments of policy) to achieve you ends (national interests and
objectives). With respect to ways and means, we can create a rough spectrum
of generic strategic approaches.</font>
<p><a NAME="Military"></a><b><font color="#000000">Fundamentals of Military
Theory</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">7. The ultimate instrument of the state's power
is war. It also is the most double-edged, for in the words of Sun Tzu,
"War is a matter of vital importance to the State; the province of life
or death; the road to survival or ruin." Thus it is crucial that we understand
the nature, purpose, and conduct of war thoroughly.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">8. No one has provided more insight on these issues
than Carl von Clausewitz, who bequeathed us four priceless concepts. First,
war is an act of violence. The use of force to compel an enemy to do your
will, and the passion that engenders, are the fundamental characteristics
shaping war's nature and conduct. Second, war is a clash of opposing wills.
Human rather than material factors predominate in war, which is waged not
against an inanimate or static object, but against a living, calculating
enemy who often acts or reacts unexpectedly. Third, "fog" and "friction"
dominate war. Uncertainty and unpredictability combine with danger, physical
stress, and human fallibility to make apparently simple operations unexpectedly,
and sometimes even insurmountably, difficult. Fourth, war is an instrument
of policy. Military objectives and strategies must remain subordinate to
national policy.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">9. Developing military strategy for the conduct
of war requires reconciling contending approaches, all of which have worked
at some point in time and space, and in some distinct set of circumstances:
offense versus defense; direct versus indirect; annihilation versus attrition
versus disruption; concentration versus dispersion; protraction versus
expedition. Just consider these various statements.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">• Napoleon Bonaparte: "I see only one thing, namely
the enemy's main body. I try to crush it, confident that secondary matters
will then settle themselves."</font>
<p><font color="#000000">• V.I. Lenin: "The soundest strategy is to postpone
operations until the moral disintegration of the enemy renders the delivery
of the mortal blow both possible and easy."</font>
<p><font color="#000000">• Basil H. Liddell Hart: "Dislocation is the aim
of strategy; its sequel may be either the enemy's dissolution or his easier
disruption in battle."</font>
<p><font color="#000000">• Giulio Douhet: "It is possible to go far behind
the fortified lines of defense without first breaking through them. It
is air power which makes this possible."</font>
<p><font color="#000000">• Mao Tse-tung: "Withdraw when he advances, harass
him when he stops; strike him when he is weary; pursue him when he withdraws."</font>
<p><font color="#000000">• Bernard Brodie: "Thus far the chief purpose
of our military establishment has been to win wars. From now on its chief
purpose must be to avert them. It can have almost no other useful purpose."</font>
<p><font color="#000000">10. Successful military strategies exploit the
synergies of combined arms and joint operations. As Hap Arnold declared
after World War 11, "The greatest lesson of this war has been the extent
to which air, land, and sea operations can and must be coordinated by joint
planning and unified command." That conviction has been echoed with steadily
increasing frequency and intensity right down to today, when Colin Powell
had written into Joint Pub I the simple, unambiguous statement, "The nature
of modern warfare demands that we fight as a team. The resulting team provides
joint force commanders the ability to apply overwhelming force from different
dimensions and directions to shock, disrupt, and defeat opponents. Joint
warfare is essential to victory."</font>
<p><font color="#000000">11. In military strategy as in national security
strategy, the complexities of war and its strategic problems militate for
a conceptual, analytical, framework to help military strategists think
through their problems. The framework for military strategy we offer our
students is shown in the accompanying schematic.</font>
<p><a NAME="Policy"></a><b><font color="#000000">The Policy Process</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">12. The U.S. Constitution, a product of political
trade-offs, personality clashes, and institutional competition, establishes
a system of separated institutions sharing powers that purposely fosters
a constant tension between the executive and legislative branches of government
and among the various departments. This invitation to struggle was the
framers solution to defining a path between a Confederation handicapped
by a weak central government and the tyranny of an unrestrained executive,
and it has provided a framework for stability and continuity of government
almost without parallel in the world. But this benefit has been at the
price of delay, divisiveness, political posturing, factionalism, and public
dismay over the perceived paralysis of government, all outcomes anticipated
and accepted by the Framers as the cost of restraining both the executive
and the anarchy of decentralization.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">13. Congress is not a monolithic entity, nor are
all its members paragons of virtue and probity. Some are beyond reproach
while others have questionable personal habits. Some have rock solid integrity;
others have more fluid ethics. All are subject to substantial personal
pressures from campaign financing, frequent travel, separation from family,
constant contact with constituents, a killer daily schedule, and special
interests, and ambitions. Moreover, all are served, and in some cases largely
controlled, by personal and professional staffers with their own interests,
ambitions, and agendas. All of this powerfully affects the way members
analyze and act on issues in the national security arena.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">14. The President does not run the government;
in truth, given our system of separated institutions sharing powers, nobody
is in charge. The White House is simply one among multiple power centers.
The President is powerful and important, but he is neither prime minister
nor king; he is fettered by many constraints. At the same time, in the
national security arena, the President generally can predominate, although
it often involves a struggle, on the basis of four sources of power: the
Constitution; historical precedent; executive authority over the machinery
of state; and public expectation.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">15. In 1947, Congress established the National
Security Council to "advise the President with respect to the integration
of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to national security."
Comprised of the President, Vice President, and Secretaries of State and
Defense, the NSC was intended to make Presidents pay more attention to
those secretaries. In reality, the opposite has happened. The NSC staff,
also created by the 1947 law, which operates under the direction of the
President's National Security Advisor, has become a major player in formulating,
and even sometimes executing, foreign and defense policy, frequently rivaling
and sometimes overshadowing the State and Defense departments.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">16. In addition to the tensions between the executive
and legislative branches and among the various departments of government,
the national security policy process is also subject to tremendous pressures
from outside players, principally lobbyists and the press. Both lobbyists
and the press represent, in different ways, special interests, and James
Madison warned against the dangers of special interests, or factions, in
a democratic government. Today, interest groups permeate the government:
they influence every bill in Congress; executive branch officials come
from and return to interest groups; interest groups reach into the executive
agencies and even the White House itself, policymakers use interest groups
to mobilize support for their policies. In a curious way, however, while
they make the policy process messy, the very proliferation and diversity
of interest groups ensures that they serve as checks and balances on each
other and on the various branches and departments of government, adding
to the resiliency of the system.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">17. We are living in a unique period in U.S. history,
one in which a series of circumstances have combined to exert powerful
new pressures on our system of civil-military relations. We are maintaining
for the first time a huge standing military in peacetime. We have transitioned
to an all-volunteer military. The principal security threat that defined
our foreign policy for 45 years has dissipated. We've enacted legislative
reforms in the Goldwater-Nichols Act that imposed jointness on the Services
and greatly strengthened the position of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff. We are subjected to vast social changes that are redefining the
nature of our society. We are experiencing dramatic, perhaps even revolutionary,
technological changes. All these circumstances combine to call into question
the very nature and purpose of our military establishment.</font>
<p><a NAME="GeoStrat"></a><b><font color="#000000">The Geostrategic Context</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">18. The international system has changed dramatically
since the fall of the Berlin Wall. One of the most important aspects of
that change has been the growing number and influence of non-state actors
and the growing prevalence and importance of transnational challenges --
challenges that cut across national boundaries and sovereignties. Some
of the most significant of these include environmental degradation, resource
scarcity, population growth and migration, ethnic conflict, organized crime,
terrorism, and arms proliferation, particularly of weapons of mass destruction.
These are not traditional national security challenges, and they most likely
will require non-traditional strategic approaches.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">19. As with both national security strategy and
military strategy, effective analysis of regional issues and the formulationof
coherent policies require a conceptual framework. Here, too, we offer the
students a notional analytical approach to use, as detailed below.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">20. Three major regions continue to absorb the
bulk of U.S. attention -- East Asia, the Middle East, and Europe -- regions
where we have key interests, have fought major wars in this century, have
long-standing security commitments, and have large contingents of our military
forces deployed. East Asia features stunning economic vibrancy and potential,
dramatic transformation and growth in the world's largest and most populous
nation, and the volatility of the Korean peninsula. Europe features a wounded
former superpower with a huge nuclear arsenal, enormous political and social
ferment in the east and southeast, staggering economic challenges in the
same area, and our most important security partnership. The Middle East
features a crucial resource for the U.S. economy, a stunningly difficult
cultural conflict, and the volatility of the Arab-Israeli conflict.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">21. While the other regions of the world don't
absorb U.S. attention and resources to the same extent that East Asia,Europe,
and the Middle East do, there too there are thorny problems with which
we must deal. Nuclear proliferation in South Asia; drugs and social instabilities
in Latin America; ethnic conflict and failing states in Africa. The challenges
throughout the world are enormous, and it will take all our skill and inventiveness
to keep our national security policy on an even keel and safe course.</font>
<p><a NAME="MilStrat"></a><b><font color="#000000">Military Strategy And
Operations</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">22. Joint Pub 1-02 defines military strategy as
"the art and science of employing the armed forces of a nation to secure
the objectives of national policy by the application of force or the threat
of force." We believe, in truth, it is much more art than science, a notion
captured best by our old friend, Clausewitz, who said. "Circumstances vary
so enormously in war, and are so indefinable, that a vast array of factors
has to be appreciated -- mostly in the light of probabilities alone. The
man responsible for evaluating the whole must bring to his task the quality
of intuition that perceives the truth at every point."</font>
<p><font color="#000000">23. The contours of the future battlefield are
changing, perhaps dramatically, in response to developments like stealth,
precision munitions, overhead surveillance and reconnaissance, digitized
information, stand-off weapons, robotics, non-lethal force, and so on.
We must understand, and to the extent we can, anticipate the changing contours
of the battlefield if we're going to be able to conceive how to employ
military effectively in the service of national objectives.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">24. The boundaries among peace, war, and other
military operations are becoming increasingly blurred, and the linkages
between force and diplomacy are growing more intricate. Military strategy
is not developed in a vacuum; any use of force is, ultimately, a political
act. Therefore, the military instrument must be considered in tandem with,
and evaluated in relation to, the other instruments of statecraft, so as
to enhance the synergies that can accrue from an integrated approach. As
our new University president, Lieutenant General Richard Chilcoat, has
said, "The strategic practitioner develops a deep understanding of all
levels of war and strategy and their interrelationships, develops and executes
strategic plans derived from interagency and joint guidance, employs force
and other dimensions of military power, and unifies military and nonmilitary
activities through command and peer leadership skills."</font>
<p><font color="#000000">25. General Shalikashvili has stated that our
"National Military Strategy of flexible and selective engagement addresses
the challenges and opportunities of the next century." It also commits
us to operating against a broad spectrum of threats and in wide variety
of environments.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">• Deterrence of nuclear attack against the U.S.
and its allies remains the highest priority task of our military strategy.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">• Space represents the ultimate high ground, a
unique operating medium, and possibly a theater of war; space</font>
<br><font color="#000000">operations are an increasingly indispensable
component of our military power.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">• Emerging information technologies and innovative
concepts for information operations are reshaping the character, and perhaps
the nature, of war, prompting Admiral Owens to declare, "Information technology
is America's gift to warfare."</font>
<p><font color="#000000">• The possibility of chemical or biological attack
was a nightmare to U.S. planners and soldiers, sailors, and airmen</font>
<br><font color="#000000">during the Gulf War, and that nightmare is only
worsening.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">• Special Operations offer a unique range of capabilities
across the strategic to tactical continuum and provide a wide</font>
<br><font color="#000000">array of flexible options in peace, crisis, and
war.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">• Uprisings, insurrections, armed rebellions,
and terrorism have been an integral part of international conflict since
at</font>
<br><font color="#000000">least the creation of organized political communities
and they will remain so.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">26. Military operations other than war represent
perhaps the most likely employment of U.S. military forces today and in
the near future. The emphasis in our current national strategy on engagement
and enlargement, human rights, and U.S. leadership in an unstable world
make our involvement in nation building, disaster relief, humanitarian
assistance, refugee control, and peacekeeping more not less likely. As
our current Secretary of State has said, why do we have a huge military
establishment if we're not going to use it.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">27. At the end of the day, whether any particular
military strategy is successful depends on how well those who execute it
can practice operational art. The theater commander is charged with linking
strategy and military operations in the field. He is responsible for designing
the campaigns that will ensure the sequence of military operations undertaken
is coherent and leads to achievement of strategic objectives. Without skilled
operational artists, campaign planners, even the most brilliant military
strategy is doomed to failure.</font>
<br>
<hr><a NAME="Distinct"></a><b><font color="#000000">THE DISTINCTIVENESS
OF THE NATIONAL WAR COLLEGE</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#000000">The singular nature of the National War College was
clearly established upon its founding on 1 July 1946, as a replacement
for the wartime Army-Navy Staff College.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#000000">Its purpose was best stated at the time by LTG Leonard
T.Gerow, USA: "The College is concerned with grand strategy and the utilization
of the national resources necessary to implement that strategy. . . . Its
graduates will exercise a great influence on the formulation of national
and foreign policy in both peace and war."</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#000000">Its first class, convened on 1 September 1946, was
composed of ninety military officers from all the services and ten State
Department officers, with six foreign observers in attendance. To this
day, State students represent roughly 10 percent of the student body.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#000000">Since its inception, NWC, now a constituent element
of the larger National Defense University, has retained its singular nature.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#000000">Its current mission continues to reflect the original
purpose: To prepare future leaders of the Armed Forces, State Department,
and other civilian agencies for high-level policy, command, and staff responsibilities
by conducting a senior-level course of instruction in national security
strategy.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#000000">Moreover, NWC has sustained strong, distinctive continuities
in the execution of its purpose and mission.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#000000">It has always been joint -- in its origins, its programs,
its faculty, and its students -- in its very being.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#000000">In similar manner, it has always been interagency
and it has always been multinational.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#000000">It has always focused on national security strategy
as its principal object of study, concerned with the orchestrated employment
of all the instruments of national power to preserve national security.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#000000">It has always aimed to produce strategists rather
than staff officers, men and women able to conceptualize broad courses
of action for achieving given ends with the available means within the
extant international environment.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#000000">Likewise, it has always focused on producing critical,
creative thinkers, capable of insightful analysis of the most complex national
security problems and development of the most innovative approaches and
solutions.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#000000">It has always been committed to sustaining an exceptionally
qualified faculty and to exploiting the most advanced educational methods.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#000000">Finally, it has always resided in Washington, D.C.,
with easy access to the highest levels of the policy community.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#000000">In sum, what clearly distinguishes the National War
College is, first, its focus on diplomacy and force; second, its thoroughgoing
jointness writ large --interservice, interagency, and multinational; and
third, the sustained excellence of its faculty and methods.</font></li>
