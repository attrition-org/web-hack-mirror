<P>National Defense University has a library collection development policy which guides the library staff in
building library collections relevant to University needs. This policy has been approved by the University's
Library Panel and copies are available upon request. 

<P>The collection development policy addresses many needs within the Library and within the University. 
<UL>
<LI>     Foremost, it creates stronger collections. 
<LI>     As a long range planning tool it identifies and documents the priorities and goals of the Library. 
<LI>    As an information tool it communicates to the users and to the chain of command the scope and nature
    of the collections, the support they provide and the Library's plans for continued development. 
<LI>     As an accountability tool it allows limited funds to be better used and provides a measure of
    accountability for the use of public funds. 
<LI>     As a selection tool it forms the basis for the selection policy, thus enabling those doing selection to work
     with greater consistency toward defined goals. 
</UL>

<P>The policy is derived from the best principles and practices of the contemporary academic library community.

<P>Copying of Library materials is subject to the Copyright Law; the law, manpower, and other restrictions
prevent Library staff from providing copying service. Self-service copiers are available to University personnel
only.

<P>For NDU users [i.e., staff, faculty and students], self service copying machines can be found at the locations shown on the floor plan. 

<P>Visitors needing copying services should consider the use of interlibrary loan as an alternative to paying the
copying costs specified in AR 37-60, Appendix B.

<P>All University personnel must clear the Library in person prior to their final departure. Fort McNair residents
and MDW employees must also clear in person. '<B><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Self clearance' from NDU Library is not authorized.</FONT></B> Both the
Information Center and the Classified Documents Center must be cleared in person. All Library materials
charged to an individual must be returned before final out processing can be completed. Timely return of
materials throughout the year as you finish with them and early return at the end of the year will expedite the
clearance processing.

<P>If you have a topic or question on which you would like to request a search, you should begin by talking with one of the reference librarians at the Information Center to determine whether a computer search is appropriate. 

<P><B>To Be Prepared:</B> 
<UL>
     <LI>Have a clear idea of the subject you want searched, how much material you need and how it is to be used. Be specific. 
    <LI> Search paper indexes for potential terms to be used in your search. Provide synonyms, closely related phrases and alternate spellings. Include professional jargon in your search statement, and the same information in layman's terms. Define acronyms. 
     <LI>Define the time period to be covered. 
     <LI>Give the reference librarian enough time to provide you with the product you want. Give yourself enough time to locate and use the articles, reports, etc. listed in the bibliography. Online searches often provide information on items not held by the NDU Library. Through interlibrary loans you can borrow the items from other libraries, but this process takes time. 
     <LI>Search results can be emailed to you or printed out.  Printouts are picked up from the Information Center.
