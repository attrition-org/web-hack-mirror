<p><br>
<b>Search Engine:</b> The software that searches an index and returns records which match
the specified criteria. There are many types of search engines but most use a database of
keywords automatically retrieved from web pages. </p>

<p align="center"><br>

<p align="center"><a NAME="subject"></a><b>Subject Directories</b> </p>

<p>Hierarchical subject classification schemes are the defining characteristic of most
subject directories. You 'drill down' to the level of entries which best meets your needs.
Directories of web sites typically have a large amount of human effort involved in the
selection, evaluation and indexing of web pages and therefore are considerably smaller
than the machine built indexes. Most often these databases are built of URLs submitted by
individuals to the directory but humans or web spiders may selectively search out new
sites to be included. </p>

<p>Subject directories are good starting points for general topics or topics where you
expect to find large quantities of information. Because of their selectivity a potentially
large body of literature is reduced to a few 'best' sites. When you know little about a
subject area these sites can provide the keywords and concepts needed for use in other
search engines. Since these sites have been evaluated they are often quite good, as are
the links they contain </p>

<p>Typical subject directories include <br>
<a HREF="http://www.looksmart.com/">LookSmart</a> <br>
<a HREF="http://point.lycos.com/categories/">Lycos Top 5%</a> <br>
<a HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> <br>
<a HREF="search2.html">Master List</a> </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p align="center"><a NAME="search"></a><b>Search Engines (general database) </b></p>

<p>General database search engines are the most common search tool encountered. These
search engines create and search only their own database not relying on external
resources. Their databases are built by web spiders or robots which search the internet
for sites to be indexed; reported databases of 25 - 100 million citations are being
claimed by their owners. </p>

<p>Excellent starting points under almost any circumstance, these search engines are
preferred for controlling the breadth and depth of searches and your best results may come
from them. They are rapidly developing sophisticated search capabilities that may soon
rival the pay-for-use databases in results achieved. </p>

<p>Typical search engines include <br>
<a HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">Alta Vista</a> <br>
<a HREF="http://www.hotbot.com/">HotBot</a> <br>
<a HREF="http://www.lycos.com/">Lycos</a> <br>
<a HREF="search2.html">Master List</a> </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p align="center"><a NAME="meta"></a><b>Meta Search Sites</b> </p>

<p>Meta Search sites allow you to input 1 search statement which they use to search many
single search engines simultaneously; they rely wholly on external resources and have no
database of their own. Often, they will consolidate the resulting citations in order to
eliminate any duplication. </p>

<p>Meta search engines are useful when you expect to find few materials on your topic;
their ability to search multiple databases concurrently will quickly identify which
database has materials meeting your criteria. The disadvantages are less apparent; search
depth is shallow, the ability to refine searches is quite limited, they may overwhelm you
with seemingly relevant materials, and, often, you have no choice in what search engines
are used. </p>

<p>Typical meta search engines are <br>
<a HREF="http://www.dogpile.com/">Dogpile</a> <br>
<a HREF="http://www.metacrawler.com/index_power.html">MetaCrawler</a> <br>
<a HREF="search2.html">Master List</a> </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p align="center"><a NAME="collections"></a><b>Collected Search Engines</b> </p>

<p>Web pages exist which collect links to general and specialized search engines;
collections of more than 100 different search engines are not uncommon. Some permit you to
enter your search directly from their page; these pages are convenient when you want to
conduct a survey of the information available on the internet since they allow you to
repeat searches in many search engines from one location. This is a very successful
strategy to locate search engines strong in the topic you are researching. </p>

<p>Examples of these sites include <br>
<a HREF="http://www.beaucoup.com/">Beaucoup</a> <br>
<a HREF="http://www.search.com/">Search.Com</a> <br>
<a HREF="search2.html">Master List</a> </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p align="center"><a NAME="directory"></a><b>Directory Services</b> </p>

<p>These are the white and yellow pages of the internet. Businesses may also be found by
searching through the normal search engines. </p>

<p>Representative are <br>
<a HREF="http://www.four11.com/">Four11</a> <br>
<a HREF="http://www3.switchboard.com/">Switchboard</a> <br>
<a HREF="http://www.whowhere.com/">WhoWhere</a> <br>
<a HREF="search2.html">Master List</a> </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p align="center"><b>Intelligent Agents (Personalized Software)</b> </p>

<p>A diversity of software, commercial and non-commercial, is available to assist you in
managing or retrieving information on the internet. Typically this software is called a
'bot (for robot), spider, intelligent agent or agent. Some of the more popular commercial
products work as a meta search engine which you install on your computer; these products
can be personalized and customized in many ways. </p>
