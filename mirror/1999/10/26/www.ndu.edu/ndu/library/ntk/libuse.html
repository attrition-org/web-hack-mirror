<CENTER><H2>How To Use the Library Effectively</H2></CENTER>

<P><BR><BR>
<P>This information is based on the comments of prior years' students in the Library Survey. 

<P>1. <B>Attend the training sessions </B>offered by the Library. These will give you the necessary understanding
to begin effective use of the Library's resources. Ask for specialized training and assistance; we will
attempt to meet your needs. 

<P>2. <B>Read the <A HREF="../cjas/cja.html">Current Journal Articles (CJA)</A></B>  then follow through by reading the articles of
interest. Many of the citations provide links direct to the full text; if not, we will send you the copies of the articles. The CJA is tailored to the needs of the University by the Library staff; it was identified as a significant research tool in previous Library Surveys. 

<P>3. Learn to <B>use NDU IQ</B> comfortably. Your research should begin here and you should feel very confident
in your ability to find info through it. We try to make sure that all of our unclassified resources are listed in
it. If you think something can be found but you're not finding it or having problems, ask for assistance. Like
all things, the more you do it the better you get. 

<P>4. The <B>electronic journals</B> are extremely valuable research tools. They are available to you over the
internet however, you must be logged in to the NDUnet (intranet) to use them from campus or from home.
Learn how to search and retrieve citations and full-text printouts. They are very heavily used close to the time papers are due; start your research early. 

<P>5. The electronic journals, however, cover only a small range of periodical titles. <B>Many other
periodicals</B> will contain information of value to you. Browse the periodical shelves for relevant journal
titles at least once or twice during the fall. Check the paper indexes on the index tables when doing
research. Ask a reference Librarian for an online search. 

<P>6. Another way to extend your research beyond the electronic journals is to have an <B>Online Search</B> done
for you by a reference Librarian. Plan your online search early in your research; it takes 3-5 days to get
one, longer when everyone waits until the last minute. When you have your search early you have time to
adquately follow through on the citations in it or ask for another search to clarify issues. 

<P>7. <B>Do your own online searching.</B> Learn to use "FirstSearch" "CIAO", "Jane's Online", and other services capably; attend the training seminars given by the Library. Use the internet to locate supplemental information but don't rely on the quality or quantity of it - you must exercise good judgement in its use. 

<P>8. Use the Library's facilties effectively. We have copiers for your convenience and plenty of quiet reading
and study areas. <B>Get away from it all - come to the Library.</B> 

<P>9. <B>The Library is open both before and after class hours</B> to  provide an opportunity for you obtain staff assistance in your research. Library staff and facilities are available 0600-1800 Monday through Friday and on scheduled Saturdays for you.  Watch your college schedule and these pages for the Saturdays we will be open.
