<p><br>
<a NAME="access"><font SIZE="+1"><B>Access</B></font></a> - NDU IQ, the Library's online catalog, contains records for all unclassified materials in the NDU Library including all journal subscriptions (electronic and hardcopy).  In the NDU IQ record you will find hotlinks which take you directly to an electronic journal.  While most hardcopy journals are located in the front display shelves, some are not.  NDU IQ will direct you to the correct location and provide the best information on current holdings.

<p><br>
<a NAME="holdings"><font SIZE="+1"><B>Journal Holdings List</B></font></a> - The NDU IQ record provides the best and most up-to-date information on each journal.  This information is found at the bottom of the title record, scroll down to find where the journal is located, which issue is current and when we expect the next issue to arrive.

<p><br>
<a NAME="circ"><font SIZE="+1"><B>Circulation</B></font></a> - Journals do not circulate outside
the Library; copying machines are available nearby in order to make a personal copy. </p>

<p><br>
<a NAME="hardcopy"><font SIZE="+1"><B>Hardcopy Journals</B></font></a> - The Library has about
1000 subscriptions to hardcopy journals; most of these, about 900, are on display in the
shelving to the left of the entrance. They are arranged alphabetically by their official
title which can be determined through the use of the online catalog, NDU-IQ. You should
note that the official title and the cover title may not be identical; the most common
occurrence of this is with government journals where many (not all) are shelved in the
U's. The current issue is displayed and recent back issues, up to one year's worth
depending on the title, are stored underneath the lift up shelf. </p>

<p><br>
<a NAME="newspaper"><font SIZE="+1"><B>Newspapers</B></font></a> - The Library subscribes to many newspapers or newspaper format titles.  These items, because of their unique format, are shelved together at the end of the journal display area.  Back files of newspapers are shelved in Ranges 69-70; because of their voluminous nature only very limited hardcopy backfiles are maintained; after a brief period in hardcopy most titles are available in microfilm.  Consult NDU IQ for exact holdings and formats.

<p><br>
<a NAME="ejrnl"><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Electronic Journals</FONT></B>
 - Electronic journals are the latest way to deliver information directly to the Library user's desktop.  The Library currently subscribes to three major electronic journal services which are described below.  We are aggressively pursuing subscriptions to other electronic journals in our subject areas so keep watching for our announcements.

<P><a NAME="jstor">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>JSTOR</B> is an electronic archive of important journal literature dating from 1996 back to 1892.  These journals are available on your desktop using JSTOR's online search and retrieval service. Nearly 100 journals are currently available through JSTOR.  Subject areas include: ecology, economics, education, finance, history, mathematics, political science, and population studies.  JSTOR is an internet accessible resource which may be accessed through the <A HREF="http://ndunet.ndu.edu/lib/lib00.htm">Library's intranet page</A>.

<P><a NAME="muse">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Project Muse</B> consists of 40+ scholarly journals.  Coverage of the titles online begins in 1995 or 1996; retrospective coverage is planned.  Journals are in the humanities and social sciences.  Project Muse is an internet accessible resource which may be accessed through the <A HREF="http://ndunet.ndu.edu/lib/lib00.htm">Library's intranet page</A>


<P><a NAME="pqd">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>ProQuest Direct </B>is an online search and retrieval service which brings over 4000 publications to your desktop.  The majority of the publications are journal titles and approximately 2000 of these are full text with graphics.  Coverage varies by title; some begin in the late 1980s, others are recent.  Subject areas include business, economics, history, information technology, political science, telecommunications, and selected newspapers.   Proquest Direct is an internet accessible resource which may be accessed through the <A HREF="http://ndunet.ndu.edu/lib/lib00.htm">Library's intranet page</A>.

<p><br>
<a NAME="cja"><font SIZE="+1"><B>Current Journal Articles (CJAs)</B></font></a> - The NDU Library reference librarians select recent journal articles which may be of significant interest to the members of the NDU academic community.  This publication, Current Journal Articles, is produced regularly throughout the academic year.  The latest edition and previous editions are available on the <A HREF="http://ndunet.ndu.edu/lib/lib00.htm">Library's intranet page</A>.

<p><br>
<a NAME="hbackfiles"><font SIZE="+1"><B>Hardcopy Backfiles</B></font></a> - The hardcopy
backfiles of periodicals are housed in the stacks with a green diamond (Ranges 49-70) at
the left rear on the main floor of the Library. Within the compact shelving there, titles
are filed in the same alphabetical sequence as they are displayed. Newspaper are on the
back side of Ranges 69 and 70. </p>

<p><br>
<a NAME="mbackfiles"><font SIZE="+1"><B>Microfilm Backfiles</B></font></a> - Microfilm backfiles
of many titles (both current and former subscriptions) are available in the microforms
cabinets (beige cases) to the right side of the Library in front of the Non-Print ranges.
Consult a floor plan for their location or ask a staff member for assistance in locating
specific materials. </p>

<p><br>
<a NAME="search"><font SIZE="+1"><B>Online Searches</B></font></a> - The NDU Librarians currently
have access to over 500 online databases which provide most of our current information on
a wide variety of subjects. These databases offer bibliographic citations, abstracts or
full text of journals, newspapers, magazine articles, as well as books, documents, and
reports. Discuss your needs with a reference librarian to find out more about the
resources available. </p>

<p><br>
<a NAME="index"><font SIZE="+1"><B>Indexes and Abstracts</B></font></a> - In addition to ProQuest Direct, Project Muse, and JSTOR, First Search provides online access to journal indexes, abstracts, and selected full text.  Hardcopy indexing and abstracting tools, such as the New York Times and Washington Post indexes, are available within the Library.  Consult NDU IQ or a librarian for direction. CD-ROM indexes to military indexes include Air University Index To Military Periodicals and the Lancaster Index, both of which are available on CD-ROM in the Reference area of  the Library.  SCAMPI, Staff College Automated Military Periodical Index, and the Air University Index are also available via MERLN on the  <A HREF="http://ndunet.ndu.edu/lib/lib00.htm">Library's intranet page</A>.

<p><br>
<a NAME="ill"><font SIZE="+1"><B>InterLibrary Loan</B></font></a> - Journal articles not available within NDU Library resources may be borrowed for your use through the InterLibrary Loan (ILL) service.  The Library has access to the collections of over 9,000 libraries as well as a number of online databases and document delivery services, all of which can deliver full text copies of articles.  ILL's may be requested at the Information Center; you will be notified electronically when the item you request is available for pickup.

<p><br>
<a NAME="scampi"><font SIZE="+1"><B>SCAMPI</B></font></a> - Produced by the Armed Forces Staff College Library, SCAMPI (Staff College Automated Military Periodical Index ) comprises over 75,000 journal and selected document citations and abstracts on military and military-related topics.  SCAMPI is an index of military periodicals similar to Air University Index and is especially strong on joint operations, operational warfare and military affairs.  SCAMPI is available from the  <A HREF="http://ndunet.ndu.edu/lib/lib00.htm">Library's intranet page</A> (through MERLN) and at selected workstations within the Library.
