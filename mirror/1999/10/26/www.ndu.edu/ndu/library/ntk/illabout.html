<CENTER><H2>InterLibrary Loan [ILL] For NDU Personnel</H2></CENTER>

<P><BR><B>Purpose/Definition
</B>
<UL>
	<LI> Interlibrary Loan (ILL) - an agreement between libraries to share materials.  Via an electronic network, the NDU Library has access to the collections of over 35,000 libraries, a number of online databases, and document delivery services to provide materials not available in the library. 
	<LI> Our goal in providing ILL services is to enhance our capability to meet your information needs.  
	<LI> Dolores Screen is the Interlibrary Loan Technician.  She will process your request, and notify you when the material arrives.  You can reach her at 685-3968 or via email at screend.  
</UL>


<P>

<B>Eligibility.
</B>
<UL>
	<LI> Students, faculty and staff of the National Defense University, including IRMC AMP, NWC, ICAF, CHDS, and CDLAMP may request materials through interlibrary loan. 
	<LI> Because of the time constraints, interlibrary loan service is not available for short-term students. 
	<LI> ILL is not intended for recreational or personal uses. 
	<LI> Non-NDU personnel and borrowing libraries, please see below.
</UL>

<P>

<B>Policies and Procedures
</B>
<UL>
	<LI> The majority of items borrowed are journal articles and books.  Most institutions do not loan audiovisual materials, reference works,  archival materials, journals (entire issues), rare books or maps.  
	<LI> Also, newly published material is often not available.    
	<LI> Please check NDUIQ  before requesting an interlibrary loan.  If you have questions about this, please ask a Reference Librarian. 
	<LI> To request an interlibrary loan, please fill out  the interlibrary loan form available at the Information Center.  Please fill out a separate form for each request (limit 5 a day). 
	<LI> If you have a citation or additional information about your request, please attach it to the form.   Give your request to a reference librarian.  
	<LI> Please allow 10-12 days for your request to be processed.  You will be notified by e-mail when the material arrives.  The material will be held for you at the Information Center.   
	<LI> If you have requested periodical articles, you will probably receive a photocopy that you can keep.  If you have requested books or documents, the lending library will determine how long you can keep the material, usually 14-30 days.  If you are going to need it longer, please contact Dolores Screen 5 days before the due date, to request an extension.  Please return the material to the Information Center.  We will return it to the lending library.
</UL>

<P>

<B>Replacements   
</B>  
<UL>
<LI>If an item is lost, please contact Dolores Screen immediately.  You are responsible for replacement costs for borrowed items that have been lost, damaged or not returned.  Replacement charges are determined by the lending library and may include processing fees.
