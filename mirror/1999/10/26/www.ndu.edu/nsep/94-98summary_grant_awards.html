<b>2. <font color="#008000">Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced
International Studies:</font></b> The program addresses the need to develop
integrated materials for specialists in international affairs with a series
of Readers in Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese. These materials
will integrate the four languages concerned with the substance of international
relations through the subject matter covered and related terminology and
idioms in international relations, economic affairs, domestic politics,
defense and security, energy and environment, and social issues. The principal
objective of these readers is to enable specialists to read articles dealing
with all these topics in the press and in journals for content, and with
accuracy. The project is a collaborative effort involving all of the fifteen
schools of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs
(APSIA) such as Tufts University, the University of Southern California,
Harvard University, and Yale University.

<b>3. <font color="#008000">Louisiana State University:</font></b> The
program develops and enhances a two-year interdisciplinary project to enhance
the only Japan Studies Program serving a 200-mile radius in the Arkansas-Louisiana-Texas
area. The project involves a cooperative international education partnership
with a small liberal arts college, two community colleges (one historically
black), local public school systems, a small religious-based college, Barksdale
Air Force Base, and several non-profit organizations. The overall goal
of the program is to offer cost-effective international opportunities to
students and faculty at institutions that separately cannot afford such
programs. Project partners will be able to provide a combined "package"
of Japanese language/cultural education programs and activities that will
be more extensive than each institution's current and projected capacity.
This approach will also serve to increase demand for Japan studies education.
The curriculum-based components will enhance Japanese language skill acquisition
for diverse types of students, including those who might not otherwise
have an opportunity to pursue Japanese language study.

<b>4. <font color="#008000">Washington State University:</font></b> The
program addresses the critical national shortfall in international veterinary
education. Global trade in animal agriculture and international animal
movement have dramatically increased in recent years. Due to ratification
of free trade agreements, trade will continue to expand both with existing
partners and into new markets. However, veterinary medical education in
U.S. universities has not been internationally oriented and the rigid curricular
structure has not accommodated additional requirements such as foreign
language and cross-cultural training. Consequently, there is a critical
shortage of veterinary expertise within the U.S. to adequately address
the challenges of the global agricultural marketplace. The Program involves
a consortium of universities and government institutions and consists of
three components: (1) enhancement of veterinary student knowledge of regional
issues concerning animal health, livestock trade, and public health within
a cross-cultural context; (2) enhancement of foreign language training;
and (3) cross-cultural and regional veterinary studies using directed international
externships.

to overcome the financial and cultural barriers which often prevent minority
and low income students from participating in international curricula and
study abroad programs. The program includes intensive language training,
two summer institutes of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign campus,
and a virtual classroom interface to facilitate student advising and student
communication through specially designed electronic chat rooms. During
the last semester of the program, students will participate in specially
designed study abroad programs, primarily in China and Mexico. Approximately
seventy minority and low-income students from around the country will be
admitted into the program: twenty University of Illinois students to be
financed by the University, forty non-University<b> </b>of Illinois students
to be financed by NSEP, and ten non-University of Illinois students to
be financed by other participating universities in Illinois and the Midwest
region.

&nbsp;<b>4. <font color="#008000">Ohio State University:</font></b> This
project extends US/China Links, a program already receiving support from
NSEP. The project provides internships in China for Americans intent on
making China a part of their professional lives. US/China Links (US/CL)
is a nationally competitive program that provides a unique opportunity
for students or members of American business communities to study the Chinese
language and to gain knowledge of Chinese business practices through first-hand
experience in Chinese corporate culture. Designed primarily for individuals
at the intermediate to advanced levels of Chinese language study, the goal
of US/CL is to place pre- or early professionals into the Chinese workplace
as astute observers of organizational and corporate relations. US/CL accomplishes
this through its Culture Institute, which provides in-depth language and
culture training for individuals with the potential for dramatically increasing
their language and cultural skills. Developing a consortium of institutions
of higher education around this unique internship program will produce
an important cadre of Americans engaged in China-oriented careers who have
experiences working in Chinese organizations, who have personal connections
with senior and mid-level managers of Chinese organizations, and who understand
relationships between governmental agencies, business, and social agencies.

The Caucasus and Caspian littoral region, consisting of the three Transcaucasian
states of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia; Russia’s North Caucasus region;
and the littoral areas of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Iran, is strategically
vital, highly volatile, and fascinating. Nevertheless, it remains understudied
in the United States. This project will focus on: (1) language training
courses for undergraduates and graduate students; (2) a visiting professorship
for one term during each year of the grant period to teach a course on
the history, politics, and cultures of the region; (3) graduate training,
dissertation, and language acquisition fellowships; (4) biannual newsletter
and e-mail calendar of scholarship events; (5) working paper series of
publications by affiliated faculty and graduates students; (6) curriculum
development; (7) library acquisitions; and (8) a lecture series. NSEP funding
will leverage off several existing programs already underway at UCB on
the region, complementing them by providing for on-campus language training,
funding for visiting teaching appointments, and graduate student and faculty
publications while building on accomplishments made possible by an earlier
grant from the Ford Foundation that expires at the end of academic year
1997-1998.

Access to instruction in the less commonly taught languages, including
critical languages, is severely constrained by dispersed expertise and
demand. This project will expand national enrollments in 21 NSEP-designated
critical languages by making these languages and others available at a
greater number and variety of institutions of higher education. The Johns
Hopkins University’s National Foreign Language Center will collaborate
with the National Council of Organizations of Less Commonly Taught Languages
and the National Association of Self-Instructional Language Programs (NASILP).
The project will implement an Internet-based communication vehicle to facilitate
interaction among stakeholders in NASILP: member institutions, campus coordinators,
target language experts, campus-based tutors, and students. With this system
in place, training programs for campus coordinators and tutors will be
placed on-line, language specific list servers will be established to provide
assistance from experts, and chat rooms will be created for students of
a particular language. With the assistance of testing experts, a plan to
pilot cost-effective alternative assessment strategies will be developed
to address the issue of distance testing, which is critical to cost containment.
The project will have significant impact by bringing critical languages
to more institutions, improving the effectiveness of the NASILP program,
and demonstrating the first viable instance of sharing of such resources
between campuses and fields on a national scale.

Five College Foreign Language Video Archive: A Web-Based Resource for Foreign
Language and Culture. </i></b>Classroom and self-instructional courses
in the least commonly taught languages (LCTLs), critical to U.S. national
security, provide crucial support to academic programs in area studies,
political science, international affairs, international business and economics,
and geographically based scientific research. There is a scarcity of high-quality
instructional materials for the LCTLs. This project will develop a new,
easily accessed web-based video resource for foreign language and cultural
studies in Bulgarian, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian,
Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Serbian, Swahili, Thai, Turkish, and
Urdu. The video archive will be available free to learners anywhere in
the U.S. over the world wide web and to traditional language resource centers
via DVD-ROM. It will provide the learner with both authentic speech and
the cultural ambience of the speech-making. The Five Colleges, Inc. is
