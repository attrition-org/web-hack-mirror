    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're excited about this inaugural issue
    of NSEP NEWS. There is a great deal of activity at NSEP and we hope that this newsletter
    provides some important insights into our events, plans, achievements and the
    accomplishments of NSEP grantees.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NSEP is pushing the margins in
    promoting global skills for the 21st century. Since 1994, we have funded almost 1,200
    undergraduate and 598 graduate students to study all around the world, excluding Western
    Europe. NSEP has awarded 37 institutional grants that are making a difference, generating
    a new paradigm for international education at a time when American national interests
    increasingly depend on knowledge of languages, cultures and socioeconomic or political
    conditions in little known world regions.</p>
    <h3 ALIGN="LEFT">Making a Difference</h3>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">How is NSEP playing such a role?</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p ALIGN="LEFT">NSEP has not only increased financial support for study abroad in and
        about areas of the world critical to US national security; it has also focused attention
        on specific areas of the world that need emphasis today in order to prepare for future
        challenges.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="LEFT">NSEP has advanced the debate about what constitutes US national security
        in the 21st century. Through its institutional grants and projects of graduate fellows and
        undergraduate scholars, NSEP has generated recognition that globalization means that
        Americans are affected by events beyond our borders to a far greater degree than at any
        other time in our history. Ethnic conflict, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism and
        drug trafficking, resource depletion, population growth, environmental damage, new
        infectious diseases and refugee migration are but a few of these perils.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="LEFT">NSEP has, through its annual assessment of national security needs via a
        survey within the federal government, highlighted the importance of combining
        international skills with many different disciplines and fields of study. These
        disciplines include history, international affairs and political science as well as
        business, economics, applied sciences, health sciences, agricultural sciences and
        engineering.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="LEFT">NSEP, through all three components of its program, effectively promotes
        increasing opportunities for minorities and other students who have not frequently
        included international study in their curriculum.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="LEFT">Through the innovative application of NSEP's service requirement, we are
        providing federal agencies and offices with heretofore unavailable expertise and
        international competency in critical fields of study. Indeed, the anxiety over the NSEP
        service obligation evident in our program's early days has been translated into an
        opportunity to seek an experience or a career in public, federal service.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p ALIGN="LEFT">As NSEP NEWS reports on the work and achievements of our scholars,
        fellows and institutional grantees, you will see why we point proudly to NSEP's impressive
        results, attained only a few years after we began to make awards. We've begun a vital task
        to create a reservoir of global skills and knowledge for American national security needs.
        For us, no goal could be more important or rewarding.</p>
