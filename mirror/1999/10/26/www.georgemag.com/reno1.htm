            would have thought that Janet Reno would become one of Bill Clinton’s 
            longest-serving cabinet members? Back in 1993, after all, she was 
            his third choice for attorney general. The plainspoken state attorney 
            for Dade County, Florida, was little known to Washington upon her 
            nomination, and upon her arrival she never cozied up to D.C.’s power 
            players. Then, just months into her term, came the fiasco at Waco, 
            when Reno’s decision to storm the Branch Davidian compound sparked 
            a fiery chain reaction that led to the deaths of more than 80 people. 
            While some Clintonites whispered that she wasn’t a team player who 
            was in over her head, Reno won the respect of Americans outside the 
            Beltway by unflinchingly taking responsibility for the disaster. </font> 
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Those 
              who know Reno weren’t surprised—the attorney general had the kind 
              of childhood that builds character. Her father was a crusading reporter 
              for the <i>Miami Herald</i>; her mother, also a journalist, built 
              the family’s house on 21 acres in the Florida Everglades. Reno grew 
              up surrounded by wildlife: Occasionally, she wrestled alligators. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">As 
              the country’s chief law enforcement official, Reno oversees a vast 
              range of issues, from the appointment of special prosecutors to 
              the supervision of the FBI. She has become increasingly active in 
              the debate over gun-related violence and has led her department 
              into a precedent-setting antitrust suit against Microsoft. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><i>George</i> 
              executive editor Richard Blow interviewed Reno in her office at 
              the Department of Justice. The attorney general can be maddeningly 
              vague when she doesn’t want to answer a question. But she also has 
              a dry sense of humor. And when she doesn’t feel that she’s talking 
              out of school, she’ll give a straight answer to a straight question. 
              “I am who I am,”she says. How many politicians could so comfortably 
              say the same?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Let’s 
              discuss some of the issues you deal with. You talk a lot about Children 
              and the importance of community. How does that fit in with the Justice 
              Department?</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF"> 
              As a state attorney in Miami, I had to figure out what to do about 
              crack-involved infants. We had to determine whether the children 
              were treated as dependents, whether the mothers should be prosecuted. 
              The doctors took me to a public hospital and showed me babies being 
              kept there because their mothers were incapacitated. They had not 
              been held or talked to, and they were not demonstrating physical 
              reactions or emotions. The doctors taught me that the first three 
              years of life are the most formative because that is when the person 
              learns the concept of reward and punishment. And I suddenly thought, 
              What good are all the prisons going to be 20 years from now if these 
              children don’t understand what punishment means? So I’ve seen crime 
              prevention as a continuum throughout a child’s life. </font></p>
