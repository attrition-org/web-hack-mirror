            <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
              the weeks following John Kennedy's death, his image lived on at 
              newsstands and on televisions everywhere. Magazines and newspapers 
              all published their homages to a life that was lived in the public 
              eye. For a little while, television turned into univision, with 
              John being the only program. What the media printed and broadcast 
              was a dramatized narrative -- beginning with John's birth and filmed 
              through the lenses of countless cameras -- that had unfolded like 
              a long-running serial, with epic highs and tragic lows leading into 
              each new chapter. That the producers of a fable wanted to distribute 
              their interpretation of its end wouldn't have surprised John a bit.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still, 
              for those of us who worked with John, the process of seeing our 
              colleague's death transformed into the stuff of popular history 
              was unsettling. Certainly, we were familiar with many of the images: 
              John as the scion of a mythic family, John as the handsome and glamorous 
              New Yorker with a beautiful and glamorous wife, John as a potential 
              political candidate. During our time at <i>George</i>, we had gotten 
              a backstage look at what John once called "the giant puppet show 
              that can turn public people into barely recognizable symbols of 
              themselves." And, to be fair, the tributes were almost always kind, 
              mostly accurate, and rightly captured the essence of John: his unfailingly 
              generous heart and his remarkable passion for life. But we were 
              reluctant to participate. At such a time, we found it hard to trust 
              our emotions, to feel confident that we'd be able to say the right 
              things in the proper way.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ultimately, 
              we decided to remember John within the pages of <i>George</i>. Part 
              of our remembrance is manifest in every story and every photograph 
              in this issue, from Al Franken's wonderfully funny report on the 
              GOP's Iowa straw poll to our countdown of the 100 greatest moments 
              of the American century. That's important to note, because John 
              knew that sooner or later this magazine would have to stand on its 
              own. Save for one or two noteworthy exceptions, he didn't want his 
              name on the cover of <i>George</i> or his picture inside.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
              month, however, we're making an exception by publishing a special 
              section in John's memory. We've tried to tell you about John as 
              we saw him every workday: as an editor and a journalist who founded 
              a magazine with a mission. In our tribute section, you'll find excerpts 
              from his editor's letters and the interviews he conducted for the 
              magazine -- John in his own words. We've also included a story about 
              his trip to Cuba to interview Fidel Castro, a fascinating journey 
              that, for reasons you'll see when you read the piece, never made 
              it into <i>George</i>. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, 
              we're publishing a photo gallery of some of the people in public 
              life whom John admired. Whether or not they knew it, he thought 
              they represent the spirit of civic duty that informed his editorial 
              vision and inspired him to create <i>George</i>. John may be gone, 
              but his faith in the virtue of public service is not. From a boxer 
              to a president, these people share that faith. So does this magazine.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks 
              for reading. We'll see you next month.</font></p>
