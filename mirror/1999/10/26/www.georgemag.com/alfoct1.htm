            <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              law gives great discretion to how leftover funds can be used. They 
              may be used for political, charitable, and reelection purposes. 
              However, most campaigns don't have the luxury of trying to determine 
              how to use excess funds because generally they end up in debt. And 
              I know a little about campaigns in debt. When I first ran for the 
              Senate, by June of the election year my campaign was deep in debt 
              and I was trailing in the polls. I realized I could end up losing 
              the election and owing hundreds of thousands of dollars. So I confided 
              in my friend and fundraiser Marty Bernstein and told him the campaign 
              was more than $500,000 in the hole. Marty asked, "Alfonse, do you 
              have the money to pay it back if you lose?" I told him, "Are you 
              nuts? Of course not." To which he replied, "Then what are you worried 
              about? Borrow more!" Fortunately, I did win. And take it from me, 
              it's a lot easier to pay off campaign debt when you win than when 
              you lose. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">P.S. 
              In the case of my last campaign, we still owe thousands of dollars 
              and are happily accepting donations. If you're so inclined, send 
              yours to Friends of Senator D'Amato, P.O. Box 888, Mineola, New 
              York 11501. </font></p>

              boyfriend told me he wouldn't speak to me again if I voted for Al 
              Gore. But I can't vote for a Republican candidate because I think 
              abortion rights are the top issue and because the next president 
              will choose members of the Supreme Court. Can you tell me what the 
              status of the current justices is? Who is expected to retire, and 
              what is their stance on overturning Roe v. Wade?</b></font></p>

            <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First 
              of all, if your boyfriend is never going to speak to you again based 
              on your presidential vote, I'd stop worrying about retiring Supreme 
              Court justices and retire him! To answer your question, Justices 
              Rehnquist, Stevens, and O'Connor are all rumored to be considering 
              retirement, and they were appointed by Nixon, Ford, and Reagan, 
              respectively. But let me say this: I don't believe Roe v. Wade will 
              be overturned, regardless of who is appointed or who appoints them.</font></p>

              I play on a senior softball team. I am a woman, and I always sit 
              on the bench for half of the game; the nine other players haven't 
              sat on the bench for a single inning. The coach uses sick and injured 
              players instead of me. The short fielder has to have a runner to 
              run the bases for him, yet he plays and I don't. What can I do?</b></font></p>

              is the funniest letter I've received to date. You must be a horrific 
              player! And understand, this is coming from a bumbling fielder and 
              a strikeout hitter. It sounds as if you're just awful, so I can 
              understand why the coach has given you limited time. But don't lose 
              heart: After he reads this, he may cut you a break. In the meantime, 
              maybe you should consider a new sport. How about swimming? I could 
              get you a good coach.</font></p>

              limit the people's choice. Our founding fathers gave us the power 
              to determine how long a representative would be in office when they 
              gave us the power to vote. If they had wanted term limits, they 
              would have included them in the Constitution.<br>
