              Buchanan is preaching to the faithful, about two dozen mostly male, 
              mostly elderly, and mostly white people sitting in the back lounge 
              of the Uptown Café in Charles City, Iowa. The room is hedged with 
              evergreen trim where the wall meets the ceiling, and Buchanan, standing 
              beside the bar, is defending the family farm. “Agriculture is in 
              a depression!” he booms to the crowd. The prices farmers are getting 
              for corn, for milk, for hogs don’t match what it’s costing them 
              to produce these goods. Buchanan blames agribusiness firms such 
              as Cargill and Continental, which “own more and more of production.” 
              He also blames foreign countries, which he says are not buying sufficient 
              quantities of U.S. farm products. He bashes the North American Free 
              Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, 
              for which “my Republican party” is “as responsible…maybe more so 
              at the national level, than Clinton.” The crowd loves it. “You’re 
              just like you are on <i>Crossfire</i>,” one woman tells Buchanan. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font color="#E0E0E0" size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When 
              the speech is over, the Uptown Café owner, Jim Brunner, who has 
              been watching Buchanan from behind the bar, puts his hand on Buchanan’s 
              shoulder. Brunner, himself an ex-farmer who lost his land, tells 
              Buchanan that there’s “something you shouldn’t do—use the ‘family 
              farm.’ They’re nonexistent today.” He says this without a trace 
              of bitterness, just a little practical advice from someone who once 
              lived the dream that Buchanan likes to talk about. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#E0E0E0" size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Brunner 
              is missing the point: A Pat Buchanan campaign isn’t about practicality. 
              What could be less practical than to give up a lucrative gig as 
              a Washington-based TV commentator to run for president—not once, 
              not twice, but three times? About the only thing less practical 
              than that is to make economic doom the central theme of your campaign 
              during a year when the nation is generally believed to be drowning 
              in prosperity. Even in Iowa, where farmers are really suffering 
              through wrenching economic times, the message isn’t selling. A few 
              weeks after his Uptown Café peroration, Buchanan will come in fifth 
              in the Iowa straw poll—ahead of two candidates from the Republican 
              party’s social-conservative wing (Alan Keyes, Dan Quayle) but behind 
              a third (Gary Bauer). On CNN, political analyst William Schneider 
              will proclaim, “Gary Bauer is the new Pat Buchanan, in the sense 
              that he…could become the standard-bearer for the religious right. 
              Pat Buchanan is last year’s Pat Buchanan. I mean, he looks like 
              a guy whose time has come and gone.” </font></p>
            <p><font color="#E0E0E0" size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
              don’t count him out yet. If his last two presidential bids are any 
              guide, the sometime co-host of CNN’s <i>Crossfire</i> could end 
              up surpassing the expectations of political prognosticators, who 
              tend to overlook the value of Buchanan’s TV celebrity, the power 
              of his rhetoric, and the urgency of his message to a significant 
              minority of Americans who share his belief that their lives and 
              incomes won’t improve until the nation restores the values it held 
              dear in the 1950s. This time out, Buchanan’s venue is less likely 
              to be the continued pursuit of the Republican nomination than a 
              third-party candidacy. “I don’t know what I’m gonna do,” he tells 
              me a week and a half after the Iowa straw poll. “You’re up against 
              two people [George W. Bush and Steve Forbes] with $100 million.” 
              Buchanan’s sister and campaign chief, Bay Buchanan, has referred 
              to a Reform party run as “an incredible opportunity.… Pat is seriously 
              considering it.” When asked about one pundit’s prediction that the 
              Reform party nomination will be a battle between Buchanan and Warren 
              Beatty, Buchanan points out that the Reform party “gave me a dozen 
              roaring standing ovations” when he appeared at its convention four 
              years ago. “I don’t think the Reform party and Warren Beatty are 
              a good match. He’s an extreme leftist.… If he ran for it and I ran 
              for it and it were wide open, I would bet on me.” Buchananism isn’t 
              likely to sweep its namesake into the White House anytime soon. 
              But it is a genuine political movement. Amid the general prosperity, 
              there’s a strong sense that the good times are disproportionately 
              benefiting the wealthy and are scarcely being felt by many blue-collar 
              workers, particularly in cities whose industrial heydays are behind 
              them; many of those feeling the pinch identify with Buchanan’s social 
              conservatism. </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
