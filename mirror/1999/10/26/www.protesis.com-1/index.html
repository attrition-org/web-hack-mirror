      now official: the <a href="http://www.happyhacker.org" target="_blank">Happyhacker</a>
      otherwise known as Carolyn Meinel takes it in the butt from <a href="mailto:jp@antionline.com">JP</a>!
      A detective who wishes to remain anonymous has worked many weeks to gather
      enough evidence in what he calls: the case of the two freaks of nature.</font>
      <p><font color="#000000">His first clue came when <a href="http://www.happyhacker.org">Carolyn
      Meinel</a> went to <a href="mailto:jp@antionline.com">JP</a>'s house.
      Shortly afer she entered the premises the curtains were drawn. She left
      after about an hour in a peculiar fashion: she walked like there was a
      dime in her butt, and she couldn't drop it. This seems nothing special at
      first seeing as this happens all the time with her, but what IS special
      however is that we were able to have a sneak peak in<a href="mailto:jp@antionline.com">
      JP</a>'s house afterwards. Yes siree, a <a href="mailto:jp@antionline.com">JP</a>
      favorite was splattered all over the floor: a peanutbutter colored stain
      on the ground with white fluid floating around in it. Due to the fact it
      is unsuitable for people to see unless they're blind or dead no picture is
      shown here.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">We decided to give <a href="http://www.drbarrios.com">Dr.
      Barrios</a> a expert in fetishes, pancake cooking, taking it in the butt
      and giver of ortophaedic clinics advise, all the tapes and see what he had
      to say. The answer was quite shocking: &quot;It is absolutely true, <a href="http://www.happyhacker.org">Carolyn
      Meinel</a> takes it in the butt from <a href="mailto:jp@antionline.com">JP</a>,
      AND this has happened before looking at the normal face she had when she
      left&quot; Furthermore he noted: &quot;Due to a missing feeling of self
      confidence, and being born during a earthquake we have to feel pity for a
      man who has wanked so much that his brains slowly drip out of his
      dick.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">So there you have it.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Good luck. And please pray that <a href="mailto:jp@antionline.com">JP</a>
      will see the results of his actions: a deformed <a href="http://www.happyhacker.org">Carolyn
      Meinel</a>, the old Packetstorm gone, needless complaints to<a href="http://www.innerpulse.com">
      Innerpulse</a>, threats to the new <a href="http://packetstorm.securify.com">Packetstorm</a>
      and all sites exposing his true identity, and will shoot himself right
      here right now. Come on, it isn't that hard: just swallow next time you're
      sucking yourself again <a href="mailto:jp@antionline.com">JP</a>!</font></td>
