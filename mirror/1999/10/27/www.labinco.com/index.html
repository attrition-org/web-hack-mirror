thanks a bunch.</p>
<p align="center">Whoops. Seeing that Phreak.nl requests anyone who changes a
site to put the message below up, I will, even if this isn't Belgium. Enough
Belgians will see this.</p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Save us from RedAttack!!!</font></b><br>
<br>
<b>RedAttack must be stopped.<br>
<br>
Why?</b><br>
<br>
Well, RedAttack does his selfpromoting at the cost of the good name of all hackers.<br>
He has no binding or friends in the hackers world at all, but he makes statements about it without knowledge.<br>
Also he wants interference of the authorities for a field which is still free.<br>
He creates panic and even fear in our society, that is absolute unnessecary!<br>
His technical skills are so low, he did'nt get any further than photoshop.<br>
If he goes on like this,and profiles himself as a real hacker, he'll destroy more than he ever will be able to solve.<br>
RedAttack needs to get into the social-society aspects of information security, before he even can dream about being a guru. In the USA he would be imprisoned for a long time,our hopes are on the Belgium authorities to do tha very same thing.<br>
<br>
The world is not waiting for another mediaclown!<br>
RedAttack HAS to quit, or else #phreak.nl &amp; #Hit2000 will help him do so!<br>
If you want to join us; place this message somewhere around Belgium, and mail to
<a href="mailto:acos@dutchtreat.org">acos@dutchtreat.org</a> and <a href="mailto:hacked@attrition.org">hacked@attrition.org</a></p>
<p align="center">(that is, if you change a page, don't bother them if you put
it in a guestbook somewhere)</p>
<p align="center">Another Face in the Crowd<br>
     By Spiderfire<br>
<br>
A thing of beauty,<br>
A well oiled machine,<br>
Motion smooth as glass,<br>
Action true and clean.<br>
<br>
A shimmering golden cartridge,<br>
Now well locked in place,<br>
All my muscles tensed,<br>
My heart begins to race.<br>
<br>
I lightly caress the trigger,<br>
I squeeze the sturdy stock,<br>
My heart begins to race,<br>
nerves as hard as rock.<br>
<br>
I peer through the scope,<br>
crosshairs fall on prey,<br>
Forever will be silenced,<br>
Spirit there to stay.<br>
<br>
A steady flow of crimson,<br>
Stains the ground of red,<br>
Life taken so quickly,<br>
Now for ever dead.<br>
<br>
Now I must flea my perch,<br>
Like a ghost leave not a trace,<br>
Escape and evade all people,<br>
Out of town I must make haste.<br>
<br>
Now my work is done,<br>
My shot flew true and proud,<br>
Never will I be found again,<br>
Just another face in the crowd.<br>
</p>
