<p>This website and the information contained herein does not constitute the offer or sale
of a franchise. The offer and sale of a franchise can only be made through the delivery
and receipt of a IDQ Companies&#146; Offering Circular (&quot;UFOC&quot;). There are
certain states that require the registration of a UFOC before the franchisor can advertise
or offer the franchise in that state. IDQ Companies may not be registered in all of those
registration states and may not offer franchises to residents of those states or to
persons wishing to locate a franchise in those states. Please continue for further

<p>Welcome to the New Store Development site. The <i>Dairy Queen</i>® brand continues to
receive a great deal of attention from millions of loyal customers as well as from
prospective franchisees.</p>

<p>We receive thousands of franchise inquiries each year from people interested in
learning more about our franchise development program. As a result, we have a process in
place which will ask for information from you and provide you with information about our
development program so that we may both make an informed business decision as to whether
to proceed with the development of a new store.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Information about you:</b></p>

<p>We have established certain minimum qualifications for prospective franchisees that are
described in the <a href="page2.htm"><i>Personal Requirements</i></a> section of this site
which includes both financial and personal requirements.&nbsp; The requirements are for
direct licensed U.S. store developments only.&nbsp; Requirements for all other areas will
vary.</p>

<p>In the event that we mutually agree to continue to explore the possibility of granting
a franchise to you we will talk with you about your background, experience, goals and your
motivation to get into our type of business so that we may fully understand whether you
are right for our franchise.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Information about us:</b></p>

<p>If you meet our basic qualifications we will provide you with the information you will
need to make an informed business decision about our company, franchise program and
concepts. It is our goal that you obtain the answers to your questions and develop a clear
understanding of our franchise program so that you may evaluate our opportunity.</p>

<p>This site is designed to provide preliminary information regarding our development
concepts. </p>
