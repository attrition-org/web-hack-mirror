Peritech Systems Plc was established in 1991 and has grown in this short time into a £ multi-million successful Sun Microsystems Valued Added Reseller. The Valued Added status of the company is proudly guarded and reflects the excellent track record and reputation that Peritech Systems Plc has within the IT world as a major supplier of SUN equipment and services.
<BR>

<B><FONT COLOR="#8B0350"><U><CENTER>Our Value Add</CENTER></U></FONT></B>
<BR>

The value-added component of Peritech Systems Plc comes from the reliable and professional way in which the company supplies its customer's needs.
<BR>
<BR>

We offer Internet / intranet solutions and Solaris based High Availability Servers. Our technical expertise can provide desktop solutions to complex mirroring and backup / storage solutions. In addition, the company forms relationships with independent software vendors and offers a professional supply and installation service.
<BR>
<BR>
By contract hiring your Sun workstations we can improve the management of your assets. 
<BR>
<BR>
With the tax benefits of leasing and off balance sheet benefits, we believe it is better to deploy cash in areas of high return and maximise your liquidity ratios.
We offer this method of finance backed by several of the major leasing companies.
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
 A profitable company, well placed centrally to support all areas of the UK and beyond, Peritech Systems Plc enjoys to the full the advantages and benefits that a fully Sun trained staff and management structure can bring to its customers. The people that work for Peritech Systems Plc feel the company's reputation is well deserved and the company believes it has the best team of professionals to offer and support the right solutions to solve it's customer's IT requirements.
<BR>
<BR>

The right mix of sales support, technical support, quality control and a highly efficient delivery system means the company is physically more than able to meet the IT needs of it's customers. This right mix of abilities, along with an excellent strong financial structure, gives the company a bedrock base from which any need can be satisfied, from the individual's to the corporate's.
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#8B0350"><U><CENTER>Commitment</CENTER></U></FONT></B>
<BR>

At Peritech Systems Plc however, we feel this is not enough. Along with the ability must come the genuine desire and commitment to provide this level of satisfaction over and over again. This desire, we feel is what makes Peritech Systems Plc a true leader amongst IT/Internet Service providers. This is what makes the company different.
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#8B0350"><U><CENTER>Reputation</CENTER></U></FONT></B>
<BR>

The company was formed around the belief that a good reputation is only as good as the last satisfied deal and a bad reputation lasts forever.  This gives Peritech Systems Plc a unique appreciation of the fact that good business for its customers is good business for the company.
<BR>

A single disappointed customer can destroy a good reputation, that takes years to grow and nurture, overnight: particularly if the customer's grievance is justifiable. And so the company works hard to ensure that everybody walks away from the sale contented, relaxed and happy to talk again.
<BR>
<BR>
Having the right products and the right services at the right price gives the company the confidence to satisfy even the largest of IT needs. By remaining honest, friendly and approachable the company is also confident in it's ability to satisfy the smallest of IT needs. 
<BR>
<BR>
This, together with the total commitment, endorsement and support of the Sun Microsystems Corporation makes the company unbeatable.
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#8B0350"><U><CENTER>Keeping Promises</CENTER></U></FONT></B>

<BR>
Making promises is the easiest way to secure a deal. At Peritech Systems Plc however, there is a strong commitment to keeping every promise made.  Our ability to keep our promises is underpinned by our level of technical expertise of the Sun product range. All systems are configured and tested to meet the most exacting standards and are only released for delivery when the quality control department is totally satisfied.
