                  GROZNY, Russia -- Russia's defense<BR>
                  minister signaled Thursday that his<BR>
                  country's ultimate goal in Chechnya<BR>
                  may be to restore Russian sovereignty<BR>
                  in the rebel region, lost in the aftermath of the 1994-1996 war. <BR><BR>

                  While warplanes buzzed Grozny, sending the few remaining, terrified citizens<BR>
                  scrambling for shelter, defense chief Igor Sergeyev made a surprise visit to<BR>
                  the front-line of fighting in Chechnya. He came, he said, to encourage and<BR>
                  congratulate Russian troops for their steady push toward the Chechen<BR>
                  capital Grozny. <BR><BR>

Well ya know what Mr Sergeyev, Narcissus thinks that you should<BR>
take up a new hobby. Ya know, one that doesnt include killing many<BR>
innocent people. You can knit me a nice sweater perhaps.<BR>
<BR>
Russia...your war history shows a nice trail of over-aggression<BR>
durring times of conflict. You seem to hail from the "Kill em all<BR>
and let God sort them out" Sort of a mind-state.<BR>
<BR>
You lost Chechnya, so accept it. And go home. Yes...home, think of it.<BR>
All that nice Vodka. The big fat women with the furry hats. Awww Home.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why did a English web site suffer this little inconvenience you ask?<BR>
Why did I not own a Russian one? Well, first off....<BR>
<BR>
England is on my hit-list too. Leave Ireland alone. Yeah, I am a<BR>
evil Sinn Fein supporter.<BR>
<BR>
And Russian servers make me ill. I always expect to encounter some<BR>
sort of freaky child pr0n or something. Ya know like the da.ru sites.<BR>

Note to sys admin:<BR>
<BR>
I seriously apologize for the little problem here<BR>
but I needed a tool to get this out there.<BR>
<BR>
Wrong? Yes. And I do apologize. But There is a plus<BR>
to this little ordeal for you. I took it upon myself<BR>
to secure your system. I fixed the hole I used to get<BR>
into your server, and I did not harm your files.<BR>
<BR>
You will find that if you rename the file narc.htm to<BR>
index.htm that your site is all fixed. Yay0rz!<BR>
