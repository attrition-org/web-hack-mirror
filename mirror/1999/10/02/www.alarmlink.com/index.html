<br><b><u><font size=+3>INDIA'S SECRET ARMY IN KASHMIR</font></u></b>
<p>A Human Rights Watch/Asia Report; &copy; Copyright Human Rights Watch</center>

<p>In 1996, the conflict in Kashmir' entered it seventh year, with little
indication that parliamentary
<br>elections scheduled for May 23 and 3 02 would either lead to peace
or end the widespread human rights abuses that have characterized the war.
All of the militant organizations fighting for independence of the disputed
territory have vowed to boycott the polls. In the months preceding the
elections, Indian security forces have intensified their efforts against
militant groups, stepping up cordon-and-search operations and summarily
executing captured militant leaders.&nbsp;
<p>Alongside them, operating as a secret, illegal army, have been state-sponsored
paramilitary groups,
<br>composed of captured or surrendered former militants described as "renegades"
by the Indian
<br>government. Many of these groups have been responsible for grave human
rights abuses, including
<br>summary executions, torture, and illegal detention as well as election-related
intimidation of voters.&nbsp;
<p>At the same time, some armed militant groups have become more ruthless.
To enforce their boycott of the polls, the militant groups have attacked
and killed candidates and campaign workers. Some militant groups have also
continued to kidnap and execute civilians. Over the past year, militants
have also stepped up indiscriminate attacks on civilians through bomb blasts
and the use of landmines.&nbsp;
<p>The election has intensified the conflict, but the deterioration in
the human rights situation can be
<br>traced to early 1995 when the security forces began making systematic
use of these irregular
<br>militias. While attempting to reassure the international community
that they have taken steps to curb
<br>human rights abuses in Kashmir, Indian forces have in effect subcontracted
some of their abusive
<br>tactics to groups with no official accountability. The extrajudicial
killings, abductions and assaults
<br>committed by these groups against suspected militants are instead described
as resulting from
<br>"intergroup rivalries. " But civilians have also been their victims,
and the militia groups have singled
<br>out journalists, human rights activists and medical workers for attack.
They have been given free rein to patrol major hospitals in Srinagar, particularly
the Soura Institute, the Sri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) hospital and the
Bone and Joint Hospital. They have murdered, threatened, beaten and detained
hospital staff, in some cases these abuses have occurred in full view of
security force
<br>bunkers or in the presence of security force officers. They have also
removed patients from
<br>hospitals. These abuses constitute clear violations of medical neutrality.
'
<p>In some cases, attacks by these paramilitary groups appear to have been
carried out on orders from security officers; in other cases, the groups
appear to operate on their own, within broadly defined limits to their
discretionary powers and the full expectation on the part of the security
forces that they will use their discretion to take initiatives within the
overall counterinsurgency strategy of fighting terror with terror. Their
actions are taken with the knowledge and complicity of official security
forces. When arrested by local police, members of these groups have been
released on orders of the security forces. Not one has been prosecuted
for human rights abuses. In this report, Human Rights Watch/Asia provides
evidence of the culpability of state-sponsored irregular paramilitary forces
in three cases of extrajudicial executions and two attempted assassinations.
We also describe a range of other abuses committed by these groups.&nbsp;
<p>Violations of human rights and humanitarian law by the regular security
forces - the army, the
<br>Border Security Force (BSF) and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF)
- have also continued. These violations include the deliberate killing
of detainees in the custody of the security forces in Kashmir and reprisal
killings of civilians.&nbsp;
<p>Human rights groups and press accounts have registered reports of such
killings every month, I but
<br>there is no sign that security personnel have been prosecuted in a
single case of summary execution.
<br>In the few high-profile cases in which courts-martial have taken place,
soldiers have been
<br>prosecuted for abuses, such as the excessive use of force, which fall
short of murder.&nbsp;
<p>Regular forces have also been responsible for disappearances and reprisal
attacks against civilians.
<br>More than one hundred cases of detainees disappearing in the custody
of the security forces have
<br>been documented by human rights groups since the conflict began; to
Human Rights Watch's
<br>knowledge, not one has resulted in the prosecution of any member of
the security forces. ' Security
<br>legislation has increased the likelihood of such abuses by authorizing
the security forces to shoot to
<br>kill and to destroy civilian property while at the same time protecting
them from prosecution for
<br>human rights violations. In the case of reprisal attacks or assaults
by soldiers on civilians during
<br>search operations, the government has ordered a handful of investigations,
but many reported
<br>instances of abuse have been ignored by the authorities.&nbsp;
<p>Indian security forces in Kashmir continue to administer torture systematically
to coerce detainees to reveal information about suspected militants or
to confess to militant activity. Torture is also used to punish detainees
who are believed to support or sympathize with the militants and to create
a
<br>climate of political repression. The practice of torture is facilitated
by the fact that detainees are
<br>generally held in temporary detention centers, controlled by the various
security forces, without
<br>access to the courts, relatives or medical care.&nbsp;
<p>Methods of torture include severe beatings, electric shock, crushing
the leg muscles with a wooden
<br>roller, and burning with heated objects. The Indian government has
not made public any
<br>investigations into any of the many documented cases of torture, nor
has it ever announced that a
<br>member of the security forces was prosecuted or punished for torture.
Although the government
<br>denies that torture is practiced systematically and as a matter of
policy in Kashmir, government
<br>officials have admitted that torture takes place.&nbsp;
<p>Security personnel in Kashmir have also been responsible for rape as
a counterinsurgency tactic. In
<br>response to international attention to the problem, the Indian government
has made public a number of prosecutions of members of security forces
for rape. However, reports of rape and other sexual assaults in Kashmir
persist. ' In many cases, these incidents are never investigated by judicial
and medical authorities competent to determine culpability.&nbsp;
<p>The Indian authorities have done little to curb human rights violations
by their army and security
<br>forces.&nbsp;
<p>In the rare cases in which investigations of abuses have taken place,
the most severe punishments
<br>have generally been limited to dismissals or suspensions from duty.
Security officers have also
<br>offered bribes and have threatened individuals and families in an attempt
to prevent them from
<br>pressing charges. The Indian government's failure to account for these
abuses and take rigorous
<br>action against those members of its forces responsible for murder,
rape and torture amounts to a
<br>policy of condoning human rights violations.&nbsp;
<p>Armed militant organizations in Kashmir have also committed many grave
violations of international
<br>human rights and humanitarian law. Armed with sophisticated weaponry
mostly procured in
<br>Pakistan, militant groups have launched indiscriminate attacks that
have killed and injured hundreds
<br>of civilians. The militant groups have increasingly made use of car
bombs and other explosive
<br>devices in crowded areas. The groups have also deployed landmines on
public roads and in other
<br>areas used by civilians. Militants have thrown grenades at buses and
government buildings, killing
<br>and wounding civilians. These attacks have occurred in the Kashmir
valley and have also been
<br>reported in Jammu.&nbsp;
<p>Militant groups have kidnapped civilians, including foreigners, and
held them as hostages in order to demand the release of imprisoned militants.
They have threatened, assaulted and in some cases
<br>murdered Hindu residents of the Kashmir Valley. In mid-1996 some 100,000
Hindu refugees were
<br>still living in refugee camps in Jammu and Delhi where they had fled
after a series of such attacks.&nbsp;
<p>Various armed militant groups in Kashmir have also committed rape and
have launched other violent attacks on women, creating a climate of fear
for women in Kashmir in which violent abuses are committed with impunity.&nbsp;
<p>As the elections neared, militant groups also assassinated candidates
and party workers, particularly those from the Congress party. The militants
also kidnaped and summarily executed suspected informers and collaborators.
They also kidnaped and murdered civilians and issued bans and other threats
against the press.&nbsp;
