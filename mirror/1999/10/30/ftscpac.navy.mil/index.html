<FONT SIZE=+1>India, a Threat to World Security</FONT></H1></CENTER>

<CENTER>India's methods for achieving regional hegemony have not</CENTER>

<CENTER>been limited to supporting covert terrorist activities in</CENTER>

<CENTER>neighboring countries alone. Whenever it got the chance,</CENTER>

<CENTER>India unashamedly invaded independent countries in</CENTER>

<CENTER>total defiance to the international law. Kashmir is</CENTER>

<CENTER>not the only case. The Independent State of</CENTER>

<CENTER>Hyderabad, had a population of 14,000,000 and an area of</CENTER>

<CENTER>70,000 sq. miles. It was over-run in 1947 by the</CENTER>

<CENTER>Indian military in a "police-action" to "restore</CENTER>

<CENTER>law and order" there, just as it did in Kashmir. It was later</CENTER>

<CENTER>annexed in the midst of international protests. Then</CENTER>

<CENTER>came the States of Junagadh and Manavadar,</CENTER>

<CENTER>which had acceded to Pakistan and were formally a</CENTER>

<CENTER>part of Pakistan, when they were invaded and annexed</CENTER>

<CENTER>despite protests by Pakistan. The Portuguese colony of</CENTER>

<CENTER>Goa followed. The independent Kingdom of Sikkim on</CENTER>

<CENTER>Indo-Tibetan border suffered a similar fate. In 1971&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>India organized a major insurgency in the then East</CENTER>

<CENTER>Pakistani province of East Bengal, cut off the air-link</CENTER>

<CENTER>between West and East Pakistan and then invaded to</CENTER>

<CENTER>"restore order". During this period it took full</CENTER>

<CENTER>advantage of its cold war military alliance with the</CENTER>

<CENTER>Communist Bloc, while Pakistan's Western allies</CENTER>

<CENTER>failed to come to its rescue. Even though its military</CENTER>

<CENTER>superiority was clearly established v.v. its</CENTER>

<CENTER>neighbors, India undertook a major re-armament program</CENTER>

<CENTER>with the help of Soviet military after its invasion of</CENTER>

<CENTER>East Pakistan. Citing imaginary security threats</CENTER>

<CENTER>from already intimidated neighbors, India has regularly</CENTER>

<CENTER>inducted weapons of mass destruction to its arsenal. In</CENTER>

<CENTER>1974, merely three years after the immoral, illegal yet</CENTER>

<CENTER>overt act of destabilization and consequent invasion of</CENTER>

<CENTER>East Pakistan, India exploded an atomic bomb right next to</CENTER>

<CENTER>the Pakistani border "for peaceful purposes". After</CENTER>

<CENTER>introducing atomic weapons in the region it went ahead</CENTER>

<CENTER>with the development of thermo-nuclear devices.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Despite claiming credentials to the contrary India has</CENTER>

<CENTER>consistently sabotaged efforts for a global nuclear</CENTER>

<CENTER>disarmament. Its latest action of vetoing the</CENTER>

<CENTER>Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty amply displays the</CENTER>

<CENTER>trigger-happy, power-hungry attitudes of those who rule</CENTER>

<CENTER>in New Delhi. It should be remembered here that India</CENTER>

<CENTER>has repeatedly turned down Pakistan's numerous efforts</CENTER>

<CENTER>(like jointly signing the Nuclear Non-proliferation</CENTER>

<CENTER>Treaty, or the CTBT, or a strictly regional peace</CENTER>

<CENTER>treaty) to bring peace to this region. In fact it</CENTER>

<CENTER>continues to be the only hurdle in the way of peace in</CENTER>

<CENTER>South Asia.</CENTER>

<CENTER>India has gone ahead with a massive program to develop</CENTER>

<CENTER>weapons of mass-destruction with missiles as large as ICBMs,</CENTER>

<CENTER>and other weapons of similar potential, when the rest of</CENTER>

<CENTER>the world is busy dismantling weapons of mass-destruction.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Now the most of Asian continent and Indian Ocean is directly</CENTER>

<CENTER>under the Indian nuclear umbrella. India has left no</CENTER>

<CENTER>stones unturned to acquire and manufacture such global</CENTER>

<CENTER>weapon systems as Nuclear Submarines and Aircraft</CENTER>

<CENTER>Carriers to further its nefarious aims. Countries as</CENTER>

<CENTER>far as Australia felt the heat when they were forced to</CENTER>

<CENTER>re-think their defense policies in face of a growing</CENTER>

<CENTER>and menacing Indian threat.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Such a massive weapons program of global consequences, with an</CENTER>

<CENTER>amply demonstrated desire for territory is reminiscent of</CENTER>

<CENTER>the times when Adolf Hitler embarked on a similarly</CENTER>

<CENTER>massive re-armament program en-route to a global</CENTER>

<CENTER>war. In fact it is ironic, how the dreaded Aryan</CENTER>

<CENTER>symbol, Swastika is as prominent in the Indian Flag</CENTER>

<CENTER>(albeit in a different form) as it was in the Nazi Flag. The</CENTER>

<CENTER>Nazi concept of Super-Man, and the racial superiority of</CENTER>

<CENTER>the so-called Aryans was imported directly from India,</CENTER>

<CENTER>where the non-Aryan portion of its population is (even</CENTER>

<CENTER>today) outcast as being untouchables and sub-humans.</CENTER>

<CENTER><B>Adolf Hitler may be dead, but the Nazism and fascism still</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>lives on in the so-called democracy of India.</B></CENTER>
