People who attack servers maliciously do not require hacker level knowledge at all. Hackers do not need  to attack anything to prove what they are. That is all. Thanks to our false educational system and the  media, that like to confuse by turning objective  definitions upside-down, normal people begin to  think hackers are criminals. The opposite is true.  Hackers seek truth and they try to spread honest  information.<BR> <BR> Why should anyone criminalize this scene, and  who? The answer is, the government. It is easy to  understand. Everywhere in the world, useless and  libelous governments exist, and have to justify their  existence. How can one justify a criminal,  organization that tries to establish a monopoly of  force? By creating threats. And hackers and  &quot;information warfare&quot; make pretty good false threats.
