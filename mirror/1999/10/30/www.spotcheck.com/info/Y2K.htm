<H2><CENTER>Y2K Compliance Statement</CENTER></H2>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<P>The year 2000 (&quot;Y2K&quot;) computer problem is an important issue
for the electronic data interchange industry and Insurance Benefit Spot
Check, Inc. (&quot;IBSC&quot;). IBSC is seeking to mitigate any potential
disruption of service, within our control, to our clients with respect to
the use of our products. The coming of the Year 2000 will affect virtually
all of the systems, applications, services and suppliers on which IBSC is
dependent.</P>

<P>With respect to our SPOTCHECK<SUP>&REG;</SUP> point of service (&quot;POS&quot;)
terminal product, we have determined that both the healthcare and banking
applications in our current version IBSO053 are Y2K compliant. Versions
previous to 5.3 should be upgraded. To determine your version number on
the POS terminal, from the Main Menu press the 4 key. Then in the next menu
press the 2 key. In the Store/recall menu press the 2 key. Then enter the
file number of 22 and press enter. Finally enter the record number 02 and
press enter. The screen will then display the current version number. Once
noted, you may return to the main menu by pressing the clear key.</P>

<P>With respect to our DOS based, Novell based, and UNIX based PC software
product, we have determined that our software will require an upgrade. This
upgrade will ensure that our software will function properly after the year
2000. Please contact our offices so that arrangements can be made for this
upgrade process to begin and complete by the end of this year. Please be
aware, that if your PC hardware itself is not Y2K compliant, then this software
upgrade will not be sufficient.</P>

<P>Our recently developed SPOTCHECK VB software for Windows<SUP>&REG;</SUP>
95/98/NT has been tested as fullyY2K compliant. During the coming year,
those sites that currently are using our DOS based software will be encouraged
to replace their DOS software with our WINDOWS software.</P>

<P>With respect to our Internet product, we have determined that our browser-based
service is fully Y2K compliant.</P>

<P>IBSC is also assessing vendor-supplied systems, applications and services
on which IBSC is dependent. To this extent, IBSC has been assured by its
major providers of &quot;switching&quot; and telecommunications services
that the systems, applications and services necessary to the proper implementation
of the Spotcheck product are Y2K compliant. We have also been assured by
our major health care payers, e.g. State of California Medi-Cal program,
Blue Cross and Health Net/Foundation, that their systems delivering eligibility
data electronically are Y2K compliant.</P>

<P>IBSC cannot be responsible or assure that each of our customers, especially
those using our PC software, does not have a Y2K problem within the operating
system or other software applications running on these personal computers
which might affect their ability to use their personal computers for our
SPOTCHECK product. We urge each of you, if you have not already done so,
to consult with appropriate providers to be sure that your personal computers
will be functional in a Y2K environment.</P>

<P><BR>
Insurance Benefit Spot Check, Inc. is a company committed to serving the
healthcare industry, and the positive response to SPOTCHECK is a proof of
our effectiveness. By creating a comprehensive tool for providers, we are
helping them make the shift to managed care efficiently and productively.
We are also helping both payors and patients adapt comfortably to the changes
in healthcare delivery via a system that works for the benefit of all parties.</P>
