<CENTER>Where is the international framework of rights and</CENTER>

<CENTER>justice? Is the UN dead, and its charter buried? The</CENTER>

<CENTER>people of Kashmir have long been promised the chance</CENTER>

<CENTER>to decide their destiny but now the UN is silent and the</CENTER>

<CENTER>US says that "East Timor is not Kosovo __ nor is</CENTER>

<CENTER>Kashmir another East Timor.'' This is in explanation of</CENTER>

<CENTER>why US interest in the Kashmir crisis is limited to</CENTER>

<CENTER>forcing Pakistan into submitting itself to the Indian</CENTER>

<CENTER>hegemony and in Timor to "humanitarian concerns and</CENTER>

<CENTER>strategically located sea-lanes."&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>The US, however, is mistaken. The reason the world</CENTER>

<CENTER>has a problem with East Timor and Kashmir is that</CENTER>

<CENTER>they are other Kosovos but in different part of the world.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Timor did not begin that way, but that is what it has</CENTER>

<CENTER>become. Whereas Kashmir has actually begun that</CENTER>

<CENTER>way. All the western governments have trouble</CENTER>

<CENTER>explaining why they cannot do anything effective about</CENTER>

<CENTER>India's conduct in Kashmir. Where are their incautious</CENTER>

<CENTER>announcements about the arrival of a new age of</CENTER>

<CENTER>"humanitarian wars'' for doing justice? Where are their</CENTER>

<CENTER>unguarded forecasts about the significance of NATO's</CENTER>

<CENTER>victory over Serbian ethnic cleansing in Kosovo?&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>President Bill Clinton announced that beleaguered</CENTER>

<CENTER>minorities everywhere in the world no longer had to fear</CENTER>

<CENTER>Kosovo-style ethnic cleansing. He said the</CENTER>

<CENTER>"international community" would protect them. Many</CENTER>

<CENTER>argued that a new humanitarian internationalism had</CENTER>

<CENTER>been created, which in the future could stop and punish</CENTER>

<CENTER>ethnic cleansing, mass deportations, state terrorism</CENTER>

<CENTER>and war crimes. The age of sovereign nations would</CENTER>

<CENTER>yield to an international sovereignty. Clinton informed</CENTER>

<CENTER>"the people of the world'' that a new era had dawned.</CENTER>

<CENTER>"Whether you live in Africa, or Central Europe, or any</CENTER>

<CENTER>other place, if somebody comes after innocent civilians</CENTER>

<CENTER>and tries to kill them en masse because of their race,</CENTER>

<CENTER>their ethnic background or their religion, and it's within</CENTER>

<CENTER>our power to stop it, we will stop it,'' he said.&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>The Kashmiris are experiencing a new kind of apathy</CENTER>

<CENTER>from the so-called international community which</CENTER>

<CENTER>forces them to think if they should forget about their</CENTER>

<CENTER>rights in the new world order and wait for deliverance</CENTER>

<CENTER>from India's fascism till the day when their valley would</CENTER>

<CENTER>become as important to Eurocentric NATO as Kosovo.</CENTER>

<CENTER>For a fair deal, should they now depend on the</CENTER>

<CENTER>compulsions of the states of India and Pakistan, and</CENTER>

<CENTER>the narrowly defined interests of the powerful</CENTER>

<CENTER>international community, rather than an international</CENTER>

<CENTER>framework of rights and justice? Given the historical</CENTER>

<CENTER>baggage and hostilities, it is useless to expect that</CENTER>

<CENTER>Pakistan and India would sort it out between</CENTER>

<CENTER>themselves.&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>It is extremely surprising that the leading powers are so</CENTER>

<CENTER>willingly accepting India's weak position on the issue in</CENTER>

<CENTER>terms of international law. The fact is that Kosovo is</CENTER>

<CENTER>still recognised as a part of sovereign Yugoslavia</CENTER>

<CENTER>whereas Kashmir is a UN-recognised disputed territory</CENTER>

<CENTER>awaiting a just and final settlement. By exhorting</CENTER>

<CENTER>Pakistan and India to treat an unjust and unresolved</CENTER>

<CENTER>UN cease-fire line as if it was as inviolable as divine</CENTER>

<CENTER>revelation, and approaching the precarious situation in</CENTER>

<CENTER>Kargil as an isolated instance of such unthinkable</CENTER>

<CENTER>violation, the so-called international community and the</CENTER>

<CENTER>UN have only eroded their credibility. Surely, the</CENTER>

<CENTER>present-day upholders of human rights and values of</CENTER>

<CENTER>justice and democracy should be able to look beyond</CENTER>

<CENTER>the line.&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>The champions of human rights, who were propelled</CENTER>

<CENTER>into action because of ethnic cleansing of the</CENTER>

<CENTER>Kosovars, have chosen to disregard the even more</CENTER>

<CENTER>serious repression in Kashmir. They have chosen to</CENTER>

<CENTER>disregard the ever-increasing number of Indian troops</CENTER>

<CENTER>that enforce Indian control through terror, torture, rape</CENTER>

<CENTER>and murder. The US, its allies and the UN are</CENTER>

<CENTER>accomplices in Indian genocide for they are doing little</CENTER>

<CENTER>more than parroting the Indian refrain, and disregarding</CENTER>

<CENTER>the unpardonable crimes of India against innocent</CENTER>

<CENTER>communities in the valley. It was everybody's business</CENTER>

<CENTER>when the Serb forces did these things in Kosovo on a</CENTER>

<CENTER>much smaller time and human loss scale. The Kashmir</CENTER>

<CENTER>issue urgently requires a just settlement that could</CENTER>

<CENTER>only be brought about with the involvement of the UN.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Peace in Kashmir and hence the region could only be</CENTER>

<CENTER>achieved if the process starts with putting the people of</CENTER>

<CENTER>Kashmir before any strategic, commercial or political</CENTER>

<CENTER>advantage of the powerful international club or Pakistan</CENTER>

<CENTER>or India. At the moment, it seems that the UN has no</CENTER>

<CENTER>power of its own. And this fact has had lethal</CENTER>

<CENTER>consequences in Kashmir, when combined with the</CENTER>

<CENTER>UN's promise that its people could become</CENTER>

<CENTER>independent if they so chose. The Security Council</CENTER>

<CENTER>thus far has declined to support the promise made in</CENTER>

<CENTER>its name.&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>Nothing short of the credible threat of a Kosovo-like</CENTER>

<CENTER>military intervention, combined with international</CENTER>

<CENTER>economic and political reprisals against India, seems</CENTER>

<CENTER>likely to end the crisis. If we agree with the western</CENTER>

<CENTER>propaganda, such as published in the Washington</CENTER>

<CENTER>Post, that "no solution can be achieved under the</CENTER>

<CENTER>threat of military action," the question arises that what</CENTER>

<CENTER>were then the US and its allies trying to achieve</CENTER>

<CENTER>through bombing Yugoslavia for more than two months</CENTER>

<CENTER>in a row?&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>The Indian campaign to terrorise supporters of</CENTER>

<CENTER>independence and cleanse Kashmir of its Muslim</CENTER>

<CENTER>population approaches a successful conclusion. It has</CENTER>

<CENTER>to be reversed. The Indian defiance and mockery of the</CENTER>

<CENTER>UN is intolerable and destabilising. The UN has to act,</CENTER>

<CENTER>as it is no more than what its members make of it, but</CENTER>

<CENTER>its existence and action are indispensable to a</CENTER>

<CENTER>minimally civilised international order. If its members</CENTER>

<CENTER>expect any progress toward a new and muscular</CENTER>

<CENTER>humanitarianism, they must back the world</CENTER>

<CENTER>organisation against those who flagrantly defy it. A line</CENTER>

<CENTER>has to be drawn, and in Kashmir, the Indians</CENTER>

<CENTER>themselves have drawn it.&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>On the other hand, the western press is encouraging</CENTER>

<CENTER>UN's inaction by treating the Kashmir crisis as an</CENTER>

<CENTER>unimportant case than others around the world.</CENTER>

<CENTER>According to the Washington Post, for example, "if the</CENTER>

<CENTER>world powers, having staked their prestige on</CENTER>

<CENTER>self-determination for East Timor, can so easily allow</CENTER>

<CENTER>their will to be flouted, the 'security and strategic</CENTER>

<CENTER>consequences' will be immense, and they will resonate</CENTER>

<CENTER>far beyond Indonesia," but no such views are</CENTER>

<CENTER>expressed about Kashmir where the situation is more</CENTER>

<CENTER>volatile than East Timor. The Post instead sides with</CENTER>

<CENTER>India and writes that it "is rightly demanding that</CENTER>

<CENTER>Pakistan help in removing the guerrillas as the first step</CENTER>

<CENTER>toward defusing the current crisis" and that "India has</CENTER>

<CENTER>so far shown commendable restraint."&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>With more than half a million soldiers in Kashmir, it is</CENTER>

<CENTER>wrong to assume that India is exercising restraint.</CENTER>

<CENTER>However, the UN and US should accept that Kashmir</CENTER>

<CENTER>issue can never be settled in a cul-de-sac. It shall be</CENTER>

<CENTER>settled either through force or through international</CENTER>

<CENTER>intervention and pressure __ the possibility of the latter</CENTER>

<CENTER>is apparently remote, although efforts should continue</CENTER>

<CENTER>in this direction. But nothing can be achieved solely</CENTER>

<CENTER>through bilateral negotiations, bypassing the people of</CENTER>

<CENTER>Kashmir and ignoring their wishes and sentiments.</CENTER>

<CENTER>India would not be prepared, it seems, for any kind of</CENTER>

<CENTER>talks unless it is under real pressure from the people</CENTER>

<CENTER>and the freedom fighters.&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>The British daily Financial Times in its issue of May 28,</CENTER>

<CENTER>1999 writes under the heading "War in Kashmir": "The</CENTER>

<CENTER>nuclear dimension means the outside world has much</CENTER>

<CENTER>at stake too. India has always sought to avoid</CENTER>

<CENTER>internationalisation of the conflict but the world has a</CENTER>

<CENTER>common interest in keeping it in check. This is</CENTER>

<CENTER>precisely the kind of problem for what the multilateral</CENTER>

<CENTER>approach of a strong UN is needed." And that needs</CENTER>

<CENTER>approval from Washington, which may not come until</CENTER>

<CENTER>we face a nuclear holocaust on the sub-continent.&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>The Independent in its editorial of May 29, 1999, after</CENTER>

<CENTER>mentioning the UN intervention in Kosovo and Iraq, its</CENTER>

<CENTER>peace-keeping efforts and the accountability of crimes</CENTER>

<CENTER>against humanity, wrote: "And this is a doctrine that</CENTER>

<CENTER>could be applied to the Kashmir conflict, which was</CENTER>

<CENTER>never a simple border dispute between the UN member</CENTER>

<CENTER>states, or even an argument about to which of them a</CENTER>

<CENTER>province belonged.... The UN has some standing in</CENTER>

<CENTER>Kashmir, too, as the guarantor of the referendum once</CENTER>

<CENTER>promised by the Indian government......... In the case of</CENTER>

<CENTER>Kashmir, however, the UN is probably the only hope of</CENTER>

<CENTER>peaceful resolution." This is why the UN has to prove</CENTER>

<CENTER>that it means to do more than just looking after the</CENTER>

<CENTER>interests of the powerful. It has to act alone on the</CENTER>

<CENTER>issue of Kashmir if not allowed by Washington.&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>India has all along opposed the deployment of UN</CENTER>

<CENTER>peace force and the monitoring of LoC by UN</CENTER>

<CENTER>representatives, and this is a clear proof of India's mala</CENTER>

<CENTER>fide. India's case on Kargil is flimsy and full of</CENTER>

<CENTER>contradictions. But here again Pakistan has failed to</CENTER>

<CENTER>bring round the world opinion. Woe to the</CENTER>

<CENTER>self-appointed custodians of international morality who</CENTER>

<CENTER>are looking the other way at this premeditated</CENTER>

<CENTER>massacre as if the Kashmiri blood is less sacrosanct</CENTER>

<CENTER>than the blood of the Kosovars and inhabitants of East</CENTER>

<CENTER>Timor. This callousness has already convinced the</CENTER>

<CENTER>bruised people in Kashmir that they are victim of the</CENTER>

<CENTER>UN, US and its allies' double standards of human rights</CENTER>

<CENTER>and morality and that the aphorism that 'might is right'</CENTER>

<CENTER>is as relevant in the game of power in the closing</CENTER>

<CENTER>stages of the twentieth century as it was in the Gothic</CENTER>

<CENTER>ages.&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>The continuing crisis in Kashmir is provoking calls for</CENTER>

<CENTER>UN action. But with the UN unwilling to intervene</CENTER>

<CENTER>without the American and Indian permission there is</CENTER>

<CENTER>little leverage left to stop Indian occupation and</CENTER>

<CENTER>oppression in the occupied Kashmir. During the period</CENTER>

<CENTER>of struggle, 70,000 hapless Kashmiri freedom fighters</CENTER>

<CENTER>have been gunned down and thousands are facing the</CENTER>

<CENTER>same fate. The sole crime of the victims is that they</CENTER>

<CENTER>demanded their inalienable right to self-determination to</CENTER>

<CENTER>decide their future through a UN-supervised plebiscite</CENTER>

<CENTER>promised to them by the United Nations as well as by</CENTER>

<CENTER>India and Pakistan. But where is the UN?</CENTER>
