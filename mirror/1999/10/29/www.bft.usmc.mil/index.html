<FONT SIZE=+0>Pakistan - An ally to the United States and a Source of Stability
in the region</FONT></H1></CENTER>

<CENTER>Pakistan, by the very nature of its independence in 1947,</CENTER>

<CENTER>attaches great importance to freedom and equality. It is</CENTER>

<CENTER>not surprising that Pakistan and the West turned out to</CENTER>

<CENTER>be natural allies in their quest for a free world, from</CENTER>

<CENTER>the very beginning of cold war. The relationship</CENTER>

<CENTER>blossomed from the very start and Pakistan soon</CENTER>

<CENTER>became "the most allied of allies" with the free world.</CENTER>

<CENTER>The common perception of the world problems often led</CENTER>

<CENTER>the West and Pakistan to such common platforms as</CENTER>

<CENTER>CENTO and SEATO. Such an alliance promoted stability in</CENTER>

<CENTER>the region. In 1979, things were shaken when the Red</CENTER>

<CENTER>Russians rolled into Afghanistan. The historic</CENTER>

<CENTER>Afghan resistance and the Pak-American alliances once</CENTER>

<CENTER>again ensured that the cause of freedom and dignity</CENTER>

<CENTER>was upheld. The defeat of the Soviet Union eventually</CENTER>

<CENTER>led to its downfall and the opening of Pandora's box and</CENTER>

<CENTER>many other suppressed nations found their way to</CENTER>

<CENTER>freedom. Kashmiris seek inspiration from this defeat</CENTER>

<CENTER>and expulsion of a superpower from an alien land, when</CENTER>

<CENTER>they hope to expel the Indian occupation forces from</CENTER>

<CENTER>their own land.&nbsp;&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>Pakistan had also furthered the cause of global peace by</CENTER>

<CENTER>promoting talks between U.S. and Iran to reduce</CENTER>

<CENTER>tensions, a fact reminiscent of the famous visit of Henry</CENTER>

<CENTER>Kissinger to China. That mediation by Pakistan led</CENTER>

<CENTER>the U.S. and China from being adversaries to</CENTER>

<CENTER>becoming healthy trading partners and did a lot to</CENTER>

<CENTER>further the cause of peace and stability in the world. In</CENTER>

<CENTER>the relatively unstable politics of the post-Soviet</CENTER>

<CENTER>era, Pakistan has continued to play its constructive role</CENTER>

<CENTER>in the world. In 1990, Pakistan was one of the</CENTER>

<CENTER>allies responsible for driving the Iraqis out of Kuwait.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Further contributions to world peace were made when Pakistan</CENTER>

<CENTER>sent one of the largest peace keeping missions to Somalia</CENTER>

<CENTER>and then to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and maintained them there in</CENTER>

<CENTER>face of an increasingly hostile atmosphere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>With democracy firmly rooted and a pro-industry</CENTER>

<CENTER>Government in office, Pakistan stands poised to</CENTER>

<CENTER>enter the 21st century with all the confidence and drive</CENTER>

<CENTER>of a modern nation. Investment is booming and the coming</CENTER>

<CENTER>together of Central Asian Republics, Pakistan, Turkey and</CENTER>

<CENTER>Iran in the Economic Co-operation Organization as a powerful</CENTER>

<CENTER>trade block holds further promise of vast investment</CENTER>

<CENTER>opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>Pakistan's principled moral and diplomatic support to</CENTER>

<CENTER>the Kashmiris is a result of its time-tested belief in</CENTER>

<CENTER>freedom, human rights and equality. Pakistan's efforts</CENTER>

<CENTER>to finding peaceful solutions to the Kashmir problem,</CENTER>

<CENTER>Nuclear non-proliferation and other regional problems have</CENTER>

<CENTER>continually been frustrated by India's refusal to</CENTER>

<CENTER>co-operate. India's Security Forces have terrorized a</CENTER>

<CENTER>freedom-loving people and made them hostages in their</CENTER>

<CENTER>own land. It is the responsibility of freedom-loving</CENTER>

<CENTER>elements of the world to uphold the dignity and value of</CENTER>

<CENTER>human life. The free world, like in the past must use its</CENTER>

<CENTER>influence to force India to honor the wishes of Kashmiri</CENTER>

<CENTER>people, stop abusing their human rights and honor the pledge</CENTER>

<CENTER>given to them and rest of the world regarding their right to</CENTER>

<CENTER>self-determination.</CENTER>
