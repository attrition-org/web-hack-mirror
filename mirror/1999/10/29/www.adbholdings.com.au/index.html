Dear Admin,
<br>                                                                                                                            <br>                                                                                                                            First of all, this site is insecure. To make the internet a safer place for all, would you please be so kind to patch? Excuse me f
or the blunt way of telling you. Writing an e-mail to the admin seems to be oldfashioned and not appreciated. I'm tired of all the
se flames comming out of my mailbox, so I jump on this lame deface bandwagon.
<br>
Bye bye,
