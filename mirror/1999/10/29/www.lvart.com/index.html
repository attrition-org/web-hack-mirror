<p align="center">Another Face in the Crowd<br>
     By Spiderfire<br>
<br>
A thing of beauty,<br>
A well oiled machine,<br>
Motion smooth as glass,<br>
Action true and clean.<br>
<br>
A shimmering golden cartridge,<br>
Now well locked in place,<br>
All my muscles tensed,<br>
My heart begins to race.<br>
<br>
I lightly caress the triger,<br>
I squeeze the sturdy stock,<br>
My heart begins to race,<br>
Nerves as hard as rock.<br>
<br>
I peer through the scope,<br>
Cross hairs fall on prey,<br>
Forever will be silenced,<br>
Spirit there to stay.<br>
<br>
A steady flow of crimson,<br>
Stains the ground of red,<br>
Life taken so quickly,<br>
Now for ever dead.<br>
<br>
Now I must flea my perch,<br>
Like a ghost Leave not a trace,<br>
Escape and evade all people,<br>
Out of town I must make haste.<br>
<br>
Now my work is done,<br>
My shot flew true and Proud,<br>
Never Will I be found again,<br>
Just another face in the crowd.<br>
</p>
