<p align="center">MURDER.<br>
I have a gun in my hand,<br>
and still you can't understand:<br>
I'M TRYING TO KILL YOU!<br>
My crosshairs on your eyes,<br>
I hope no one cries.<br>
Damn it's hot,<br>
Concentrate: take your shot.<br>
Me and my black clothes,<br>
My bullets in his head.<br>
Yes! He's dead.<br>
Say bye bye now...<br>
You ain't coming back,<br>
to abuse me and use crack.<br>
My energy is to good for you,<br>
so why do I do what I do?<br>
I hate myself, a feeling of guilt kicks in,<br>
I wish I hadn't taken the shot,<br>
and damn, what was it hot.<br>
