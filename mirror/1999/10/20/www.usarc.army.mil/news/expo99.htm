    <h2><b>Third annual Minnesota Military Expo draws thousands</b></h2>
    <p>By Staff Sgt. David Bennett, 367<font SIZE="1">th</font> MPAD, Whitehall, Ohio</p>
    <p>FORT SNELLING, Minn. -- The 1999 Minnesota Military Expo, held July 31 and Aug. 1, was
    packed with enough &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;ahs&quot; to last into the next millennium.</p>
    <p>The Expo, sponsored by the Army Reserve's 88th Regional Support Command, showcased the
    past and the present, the historic and the futuristic. Precision drill teams and military
    gadgetry attracted thousands of visitors to the two-day event.</p>

    <p>In an effort to make the joint-service, community outreach event bigger and better,
    88th officials coordinated special events, including The Moving Wall, a replica of the
    Vietnam Veterans Memorial located in Washington, D.C.</p>
    <p>&quot;There are many people who have never had a chance to visit Washington,&quot; said
    88th Command Sgt. Maj. Robert H. Bowden. &quot;We placed it in a place by itself and there
    were no vendors.&quot;</p>
    <p>The U.S. Army Drill Team's silent drill routine, a mass casualty exercise by the 114th
    Combat Support Hospital, and a Kid's Basic Training put on by the 88th RSC were other
    events that combined to draw approximately 40,000 visitors to the third annual Expo, more
    than double any previous year's crowd.</p>

    <p>Maj. Gen. George Steiner, who retired from the Army Reserve as 88th RSC commander in
    1997, said informing the public is key.</p>
    <p>&quot;The two words that come to mind is dynamic and entertaining,&quot; said Steiner,
    who chaired the Expo Committee this year. &quot;Static (displays) are the old way of doing
    business. We have to look at doing better for the people coming out here and acquaint the
    community with what the military is doing.&quot;</p>
