    <h4>National Army Medical Department Augmentation Detachment provides innovative training
    opportunities</h4>
    <p><font size="3">By Mr. Tony Johnson, USARC Public Affairs</font></p>
    <p>ATLANTA -- As an anxious mother looks on, Dr. Melvin Berger closely examines the light
    red rash that is visible over most of the arms and legs of her otherwise healthy and
    rambunctious 10-month old little boy. The child offers some protest when the doctor tries
    to look in his ears but is otherwise happy and content to play with his mother&#146;s
    keys. A mild food allergy is the suspected cause of the rash. The following week Berger is
    setting up office in a tent among the vast training fields at the Army&#146;s Joint
    Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, La. This is quite a contrast from the quiet
    suburban Cleveland office where he was examining the little boy. </p>
    <p>When not in Cleveland working as an allergy and immunology specialist, Berger serves as
    Col. Berger with the 324th Combat Support Hospital based in Perrine, Fla. After three
    years serving with the Public Health Service followed by three years on active duty at
    Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Berger joined the Army Reserve in 1984. </p>
    <p>&quot;My everyday work as a highly specialized allergy and immunology practitioner is
    focused on complicated conditions requiring complex diagnosis. During my Army Reserve duty
    I see twisted ankles, things requiring simpler diagnosis and treatment. The two really
    compliment each other,&quot; said Berger. &quot;I get a good refresher in general medicine
    when I&#146;m in uniform.&quot;</p>

    <p>Berger works as a professor of pediatrics and pathology at Case Western Reserve
    University School of Medicine as well as serving as chief of the division of
    immunology/allergy/rheumatology at Rainbow Babies and Children&#146;s Hospital. His
    schedule includes conducting research and teaching classes at Case Western three to four
    days a week, while seeing patients, primarily children, the other days. </p>
    <p>This hectic and demanding schedule could present quite a challenge in trying to attend
    regular Army Reserve drill weekends and annual training. But Berger is a member of a
    special division of the Army Medical Corps that allows him a great deal of flexibility in
    scheduling his Reserve duty. He is a member of the National Army Medical Department
    Augmentation Detachment.</p>
    <p>The primary mission of the NAAD is to manage Army medical officers with critical
    specialties who are not close to a unit. Established in November 1988 the NAAD was
    initially assigned to Forces Command and then transferred to the U.S. Army Reserve Command
    in 1991. Based at Fort McPherson in Atlanta, the NAAD is responsible for the management of
    all personnel, training, quality assurance, and finance actions for soldiers assigned to
    the NAAD. </p>
    <p>One of the main advantages of the NAAD is that it offers flexible and innovative
    training that lessens scheduling conflicts with busy private medical practices and
    hospital rotations. NAAD soldiers don&#146;t actually attend drill with their units;
    instead they are required to perform a portion of their annual training with the assigned
    unit every other year. Since NAAD members are not required to train year-round with their
    units, they can live hundreds or even thousands of miles away. </p>
    <p><font size="3">Rather than traveling to Florida to drill with his unit, Berger actually
    conducts part of his Reserve duty with the Air Force Reserves 910th Medical Squadron in
    Youngstown, Ohio. Reserve duty for NAAD members can be done at military or Veteran&#146;s
    Affairs hospitals and even in some cases, civilian facilities. Even though they are not
    with their unit, NAAD members still wear the appropriate uniform. NAAD soldiers are also
    required to pass the Army Physical Fitness Test annually and meet height and weight
    standards.</font></p>
    <p>In the event of a mobilization, NAAD soldiers mobilize with their unit of assignment.
    When the 324th was mobilized in February 1997 to support the ongoing NATO peacekeeping
    mission in Bosnia, Berger went with them. For eight months he served as the first Army
    Reserve commander of the Task Force Eagle Base Hospital in Taszar, Hungary. He has also
    participated in missions in Panama, Honduras and Ecuador as well as missions in the U.S.
    at Fort Gordon, Ga., and Fort Polk. </p>
    <p>&quot;I like the opportunity to go out in the field,&quot; said Berger. &quot;It&#146;s
    a nice change from my regular practice.&quot; Of his time in Hungary Berger commented,
    &quot;It was terrific. I never thought that I would actually be in a command position. It
    was a tremendous learning experience and the total embodiment of all my military
    training.&quot; </p>

    </center></div><p>NAAD members are encouraged to develop as a soldier as well as a medical
    professional. Another alternative for annual training is attendance at Army professional
    development courses or AMEDD training such as the Combat Casualty Course. Some NAAD
    members have attended Basic Airborne or Air Assault training. </p>
    <p>Atlanta resident and NAAD member Lt. Col. Janet Londagin, a registered nurse assigned
    to the 396th Combat Support Hospital based in Spokane, Wash., takes advantage of one
    aspect of the training option for completing her Reserve drill time. For the past two
    years she has served as an instructor for the Trauma Nurse Corps Course. This one-week
    course is conducted at various times at military installations around the country.</p>
    <p>&quot;I like teaching the course,&quot; said Londagin. &quot;I also like being able to
    make my Reserve schedule work around my life. I let the NAAD know when I&#146;m available
    and they find me an assignment.&quot; </p>
    <p>Londagin joined the NAAD in 1992 after seven years on active duty and has done portions
    of her Reserve duty at Camp Parks, Calif., Fort Gordon, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, and Fort
    McCoy, Wis. </p>
    <p>&quot;I&#146;m eligible to retire from the Army but I&#146;ll keep doing this as long
    as I keep having fun,&quot; said Londagin. When she&#146;s not wearing her military
    uniform, she works at both South Fulton and Piedmont Hospitals in metro Atlanta. </p>
    <p>More than 1000 doctors and nurses are currently assigned to the NAAD. Critical
    specialties needed by the NAAD include: nurse anesthetist, critical care nurse,
    operational medicine physician, family physician, thoracic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon,
    emergency physician, and comprehensive dentist.</p>
    <p>The NAAD provides unit commanders the ability to fill vacant, high priority positions
    with qualified soldiers who are not available within the local geographic area. This also
    allows qualified doctors and nurses to continue serving their country even though a unit
    is not in their area. It&#146;s a win-win situation for the soldier and the Army. </p>
    <p>After working in a tent for a week at Fort Polk, La., Berger returns to his practice
    and teaching duties in Cleveland. And to more of his young patients until it is time for
    him once again to don his uniform. </p>
