    <h2 align="left">Army Reserve Apache unit deploys to Bosnia</h2>
    <p>by Tony Johnson, U.S. Army Reserve Command Public Affairs</p>
    <p>ATLANTA (August 30, 1999) -- It was a hot, humid and overcast day in South Georgia. The
    soldiers from the U.S. Army Reserve 8/229th Aviation Battalion (Attack), weighed down with
    their gear climbed aboard the lone-commercial airliner sitting on the airfield at Fort
    Benning, Ga. </p>
    <p>There were no crowds to see them off - a special family day had been held a couple of
    weeks earlier at their home base at Fort Knox, Ky., as their official send-off. There were
    no mobs of media present to cover the story &#150; most everyone seems to have lost
    interest in this type of mission.&nbsp; But it was a very real and important mission; very
    exciting and even scary for these soldiers as they left their families, friends and &nbsp;
    jobs for six months to do their part in supporting the ongoing NATO peacekeeping
    operations in Bosnia</p>
    <p>&quot;I&#146;m ready to get there, ready to do our job and ready to get back
    home,&quot; said Spec. Cristal Fox, a 20-year old ammunition specialist who has been with
    the unit for about three years. A criminology major at the University of Louisville, Fox
    will be taking a break from her studies as she learns first-hand about the sometimes
    volatile balance of peace and power in the Balkans region. &quot;I think it will be a
    great learning experience. A chance to learn about different people and their culture.
    I&#146;m excited about going.&quot;. </p>

    <p>Fox leaves behind her parents, Lisa and Thomas Clay, her cat and pet rabbit. &quot;My
    folks are nervous but proud. My dad has served in the military and he&#146;s very proud of
    what I&#146;m doing.&quot;</p>
    <p>For several months now members of the 8/229th have been preparing for this mission. The
    unit received notice back in January that they would be heading to Bosnia and they have
    been training rigorously ever since. </p>
    <p>&quot;I&#146;ve been training for a mission like this for eight years. I know
    we&#146;re trained and ready to do this. To be honest, I&#146;m kind of excited about
    going,&quot; said Sgt. Rob Welborn, an Apache mechanic with the unit. &quot;I will miss my
    family,&quot; he added.&nbsp; He also leaves his job in an aluminum plant, but says his
    employer is very supportive of his Reserve duty. </p>
    <p>&quot;My parents are so proud they can&#146;t stand it,&quot; added Welborn. </p>

    <p>The 8/229th is one of only two Apache units in the Army Reserve. These are the same
    Apache attack helicopters profiled in recent months in various news stories as being the
    most advanced helicopter in the U.S. Army&#146;s inventory.</p>
    <p>The Apache flies low and fast and uses computerized targeting systems to help it
    knock-out enemy tanks with armor-piercing laser-guided Hellfire missiles, which can strike
    targets up to three miles away. The Apache has a range of 299 miles, with a cruising speed
    of 184 mph and maximum speed of 227 mph dependent on weather conditions and other factors.
    It can be equipped with 16 Hellfire missiles or 76 2.75-inch rockets. It is also equipped
    with a 30-mm gun normally loaded with 1000 rounds. </p>
    <p>Sixteen Apaches were shrink-wrapped for protection and shipped over to Croatia via
    military freighter after being flown to Howland Hook container port on Staten Island,
    N.Y., by members of the 8/229th. The Apaches will be waiting for the soldiers when they
    arrive in Tusla, Bosnia. </p>
    <p>While in Bosnia the mission for the 8/229th is to help maintain the peace and provide
    support as needed for NATO&#146;s efforts in the region. </p>
    <p>&quot;If we can save lives by our presence, then I&#146;m glad that we can be
    there,&quot; said Sgt. 1st Class Rick Voeltner, the non-commissioned officer in charge of
    the administrative section of the unit. </p>
    <p>Pfc. Donald Drake just graduated from his military advanced individual training school
    in July as an aircraft structural repairer. The 18-year-old says he joined the Army
    Reserve for adventure and training and he&#146;s getting both right away. Drake will be
    leaving for Bosnia with the next group from the 8/229th within approximately a week.</p>
    <p>&quot;This is awesome. I&#146;m ready to go. This will be the experience of a
    lifetime,&quot; said Drake as he watched his fellow unit members boarding the plane. </p>
    <p>Camie Smallwood, wife of Spec. Darrell Smallwood, echoed the sentiments of the family
    members of all the 8/229th soldiers when she said, &quot;I know he&#146;s doing his job
    but I&#146;m going to miss him. I just want him to come home safe and sound.&quot;</p>
