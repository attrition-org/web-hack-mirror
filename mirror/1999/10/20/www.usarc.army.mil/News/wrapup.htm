    Joint Task Force New Hope &#150; El Salvador</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">CHILANGUERA, El Salvador &#150; Throughout the late spring and summer,
    thousands of citizens-soldiers of the Army Reserve arrived here for once in a lifetime
    training and the opportunity to offer the people of El Salvador and other Central American
    nations &quot;new hope.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The primary focus of Exercise Nuevos Horizontes (New Horizons) 1999-II
    provided real world engineer, medical and service support training experience for Army
    Reserve soldiers while helping people in the hardest hit areas of Central America recover
    from the devastation brought on by Hurricane Mitch last fall. The projects started in late
    March in Guatemala and Honduras, late April in El Salvador, and in late May in Nicaragua
    and continued through August.</font></p>

    <p><font size="3">The exercises in El Salvador (this article&#146;s focus) were conducted
    by the U.S. and El Salvadoran Army Joint Task Force New Hope &#150; El Salvador.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Beginning in April, the task force began operations with the
    establishment of a base camp near the village of Chilanguera, which was virtually
    destroyed by the floods caused by the hurricane. A total of 36 Reserve and Active Duty
    soldiers served as the exercise duration staff and played host to nine rotations of
    approximately 300 Reservists each. Each rotation brought elements of at least 36 units
    from throughout the United States. Roughly 2,800 soldiers participated in all from the
    U.S. More than 160 El Salvadoran soldiers also participated in the exercise.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Amidst the devastation the Americans were amazed at the beauty of the
    countryside and the gracious and appreciative nature of the El Salvadoran citizens. The
    base camp was situated in a remote mountain valley that was flanked on the northeastern
    side by the awe-inspiring majesty of the active Chaparrastique, better known as the
    Volcano of San Miguel. The forward support camp was right on the beach of the Pacific
    Ocean coastline.</font></p>

    <p><font size="3">The climate was not as pleasant and made the incredible workload more
    challenging. Incredible tropic heat and humidity presented the greatest danger for
    casualties and caused many mechanical failures. In fact the intense heat along with tough
    working conditions was responsible for more than one hood cover melting onto the engines
    of 5-ton trucks and other vehicles. The heat also baked the earth into a fine dry dust
    that got into everything&#133;that is until the rainy season began in the middle of the
    sixth rotation. Once nicknamed Camp Polvarin (Spanish for Dust Bowl), the monsoons turned
    the base camp into a deep morass of chocolatey goo.</font></p>

    <font size="3"><p><font size="3">Despite the climate and terrain, an incredible amount of
    work was accomplished during the exercise that ended in mid-August. The engineers
    completed four bridges; rechanneled a riverbed and an emergency run-off channel; built two
    schools and a community center; drilled two wells and constructed a medical clinic.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Another significant operation of the task force was ongoing medical
    readiness exercises that occurred at 13 locations in four provinces. The doctors, nurses
    and medics were screening and treating an average of 3,000 El Salvadorans during each
    rotation. The majority of ailments involved upper respiratory infections, parasites, skin
    conditions and dental needs. Veterinary specialists assisted El Salvadorans in treating
    livestock and using better management practices.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Supporting this intensive activity behind the scenes were automated
    logistics specialists, mechanics, drivers, cooks, communications specialists, water
    purification specialists, military police and a bath and laundry unit. Their support
    provided a great deal of comfort and improved troop morale under the austere conditions of
    remote training locations.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The service support system certainly helped morale, but it was the very
    nature of the mission that caused morale throughout the exercise to be universally
    sky-high amongst all the troops. Not even the heat, humidity and tropical torrents of rain
    could dampen spirits.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;It gets hot in Georgia, but not like this,&quot; said Sgt. Lewis
    Shelton, who resides in Cartersville, Ga. and is a member of Company B, 844<sup>th</sup>
    Engineer Battalion, located in Chattanooga, Tenn. &quot;You have a little more sense of
    purpose helping these kids,&quot; Shelton said as he and other members of his unit laid
    bricks for the school they were building for the villagers of Agua Fria. The construction
    was occurring under the watchful eye of the school&#146;s students as they were holding
    their classes under the shade of a nearby tree.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The training provides a greater opportunity to understand other cultures
    and build better relations with friendly nations. &quot;This training has broken down a
    lot of stereotypes. Many people think other countries are like a Sally Struthers&#146;
    commercial with lots of poverty,&quot; Shelton Said. &quot;It has cities with malls and
    country areas. These are regular people just like us. They are happy we are here and it is
    great to work with the El Salvadorans. They are hard workers!&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font size="3">Admiration works both ways. Agua Fria schoolteacher Roosevelt de Jesus
    del cid appreciates the fine work the American citizen-soldiers are doing for the school
    and kids. &quot;It is wonderful. What they are doing is work from the heart and it is
    great that they help the poor people,&quot; Jesus del cid, said. &quot;It is good to have
    the Americans here because they have taken an interest in the children and our village.
    The kids are learning from the Americans and feel comfortable around them.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Many soldiers found this exercise to be the best training of their
    careers. Seasoned veteran Sgt. 1<sup>st</sup> Class David Roe, the rotation NCOIC for the
    89<sup>th</sup> RSC&#146;s 1013<sup>th</sup> Quartermaster Company, located in North
    Platte and McCook, Neb. is a perfect example. &quot;It is a great idea (training in El
    Salvador). We get to do our mission and completely set up all of our equipment normally
    assigned to us, while at the same time we help the people of El Salvador,&quot; Roe said.
    &quot;This is the most productive annual training I have ever had with this unit. I have
    learned more about overcoming problems including fixing all or our equipment.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">An outside observer helps to validate Roe&#146;s points. Television news
    reporter Tregg White from the North Platte, Neb. station KNOP accompanied Reservists from
    the 1013<sup>th</sup> during the eighth rotation. &quot;Very remarkable, my expectations
    were exceeded,&quot; White said. &quot;This was my very first time working with the
    military. I was surprised at how well the chain of command worked and how the different
    units worked together cohesively. They were a lot of fun, but it was all about
    business.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">White considers his exposure to the Army Reserve a rewarding
    professional development opportunity. &quot;It was a great learning experience. In fact,
    it was an experience of a lifetime. It was great to travel with the Reserves and see how
    well we were received by the El Salvadorans,&quot; White said.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Other soldiers have found the exercise is providing them some new hope
    as well, as years of preparation at their units is really starting to pay-off. &quot;This
    is good training with all of these soldiers. This is the real stuff, not a class like at
    drill,&quot; according to Sgt. Ariel Custodio, a resident of Belton, Mo., and an automated
    logistics specialist with the 89<sup>th</sup> RSC&#146;s, 375<sup>th</sup> Quartermaster
    Company, Belton, Mo. Custodio is not implying that training at drill is all bad.
    &quot;Understanding my job and how the process goes&#133;everything I have learned at the
    Reserve Center is applying here now.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">For Private 1<sup>st</sup> Class Jamika Roberts, from Overland Park,
    Kan., and also with the 375<sup>th</sup> Quartermaster Company, the chance to do her job
    in the field was not the only challenge. &quot;I was scared initially about coming here.
    Mostly because of all the pre-deployment briefings and shots we had to take. But this is
    awesome that we are able to come over here and help these people,&quot; Roberts said.
    &quot;I am glad to be here and be part of something that will be remembered after we are
    gone.&quot;</font></p>
