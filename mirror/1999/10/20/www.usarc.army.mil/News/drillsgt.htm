    even individual success, requires a team effort.&quot;</font></p>
    <font size="3"><p>He should know.</font><font size="4">&nbsp; </font><font size="3">In
    ceremonies at Fort Monroe on June 18th, Priest, representing the 84th Division
    (Institutional Training), was awarded the title of the Reserve Component Drill Sergeant of

    <font size="3"><p>&quot;It&#146;s the most coveted award in the United States Army
    Reserve&quot; observes Maj. Gen. Robert Smith III, the Commander of the 84th Division
    (IT).</p>
    <p>During the ceremony Gen. John Abrams, the Commander of Training and Doctrine Command
    (TRADOC), also presented the Meritorious Service Medal to Sgt. 1st Class Priest. </font></p>
    <font size="3"><b><p>The Drill</b></p>
    <p>The annual Drill Sergeant of the Year Competition is a selection process, starting with
    nominations up to battalion, with selection boards conducted at brigade, which culminate
    at the Training Division level for the Reserve Component and at Army Installation level
    for the Active Component. The finalists of those boards meet head-to-head for the four-day
    competition conducted by TRADOC at Fort Monroe, Virginia.</p>
    <p>One portion of the competition is the Army Physical Fitness Test.</p>
    <p>&quot;It was a hot and muggy day at Fort Monroe,&quot; recalls 84th Division Drill
    Sergeant School Command Sgt. Maj. Frank Parker, &quot;and Priest tore up the run, beating
    all the Active Component and Reserve soldiers in the field with a time of 11:55 on the 2
    mile.&quot; </p>
    <p>In addition to the physical test, the competition includes an instructional
    demonstration of the common soldiering tasks drill sergeants teach during basic training.
    Sgt. 1st Class Priest, a Drill Sergeant Leader with the 84<sup>th</sup> Division (IT)
    Drill Sergeant School, trains Drill Sergeant Candidates those same skills as part of his
    Annual Training mission at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.</p>
    <p>The competition finishes with a board of senior command sergeants major who quiz the
    candidates on leadership and training issues.</p>
    <p>What&#146;s rewarding about being a Drill Sergeant in the Army Reserve? Just ask Sgt.
    1st Class Priest.</p>
    <p>&quot;I get satisfaction watching a soldier be successful, watching their pride and the
    manifestation of that pride.&quot; reflects Priest. &quot;Watching individuals becoming
    part of a team, working as a unit, that&#146;s when a unit becomes successful.&quot;</font></p>
    <b><p><font size="3">The Home Team</b></p>
    <p>When he &#145;plays civilian&#146;, Robert Priest (his friends call him Todd), has
    other team members behind him. He works at Subaru-Isuzu Automotive, Inc. of Lafayette,
    Indiana in the Safety and Environmental Compliance Section. Priest is quick to thank those
    who help make him successful.</p>
    <p>&quot;My work- they support me wholeheartedly. Not only the managers but my fellow
    associates. They cover for you, look out for you.&quot; </p>
    <p>Sgt. 1st Class Priest appreciates the home front also.</p>
    <p>&quot;My family--I take time away from my children and my wife to study and train. My
    wife Vickie has to handle many things without me because I&#146;m gone a lot for the
    Army.&quot; </p>
    <p>Priest knows it&#146;s important to make the time to take off his &#145;hat&#146; as
    &quot;often as I can to be daddy to Kameron who is 7, and Sage who is 5.&quot;&nbsp; He
    rounds out his team by saying, &quot;My unit gave me the time to train for the competition
    during drill weekends- and that&#146;s important too.&quot;</p>
    </font><b><p><font size="3">The Next Step</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="3">There&#146;s still another road march ahead for Priest. Later this year
    he&#146;ll be honored at a Pentagon ceremony at which Gen. Eric Shinseki, chief of staff,
    will present to him the Ralph E. Haines Jr. Award. The award is named after Haines who
    headed the Continental Army Command, the forerunner of TRADOC and Forces Command. </p>
    <p>But Priest never forgets the team.&nbsp; &quot;My team is my family, my employer and my
    unit,&quot; he recognizes.&nbsp; &quot;You need a balance of all three of those things to
    be successful.&quot;</p>
