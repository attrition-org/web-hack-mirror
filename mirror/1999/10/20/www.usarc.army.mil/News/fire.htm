    <p>FORT HUNTER LIGGETT, Calif. -- The largest forest fire in the history of California has
    engulfed more than 80,000 acres in the Los Padres National Forest area north of Los
    Angeles since it first ignited in early September. Approximately 30,000 acres of Fort
    Hunter Liggett located adjacent to Los Padres have been consumed. Hunter Liggett
    personnel, both Army Reservists and Department of the Army civilians, have played key
    roles in assisting the U.S Forest Service in their efforts to contain and extinguish the
    fire. </p>

    </center></div><p>The 25 members of the Fort Hunter Liggett Fire Department have been
    working along side the 500 plus fire fighters from around the country to control the fire.
    Hunter Liggett fire fighters have worked as members of Crash Fire Rescue Crews and have
    assisted with back burning efforts. </p>
    <p>Employees from the Hunter Liggett Department of Public Works have operated bulldozers
    to create roads to provide better access to the fire. They have also assisted in building
    fire breaks to try and stop the fires from spreading. The Hunter Liggett Department of
    Plans and Training staff has briefed fire crews on the unique terrain and layout of the
    installation. They have also assisted fire crews in finding the quickest and safest routes
    to the fire areas. </p>
    <p>Because of the mountainous terrain of the area, cellular phone service is not reliable.
    Hunter Liggett Directorate of Information Management personnel have run communication
    lines to the fire command center to improve communications inside and around the fire
    area. </p>
    <p>The Tusi Heliport located on the base has proven an invaluable asset for the fire
    fighting efforts. By staging from Tusi, response time has been cut in half for shuttling
    smoke jumpers and medical personnel to and from the fire. Hunter Liggett personnel have
    been on-hand to provide fueling and maintenance support for the helicopters using Tusi. </p>
    <p>Temporary housing has been provided at Hunter Liggett for fire crews. The community
    club, bowling center, recreation center and post movie theater have all been made
    available to the fire crews. </p>
    <p>&quot;The support we have been receiving from Fort Hunter Liggett has been
    outstanding,&quot; said Mr. Jeff Frazier, a spokesperson for the U.S. Forest Service.
    &quot;The Fort Hunter Liggett Fire Department&#146;s part in suppressing this fire has
    been integral to our efforts to bring this fire under control.&quot;</p>
    <p>The Forest Service presented Mark Hamelin, executive officer for the base, a plaque in
    appreciation of all the support and assistance provided by Hunter Liggett. The plaque was
    made from a piece of a redwood tree that was damaged during the fire. </p>
    <p>Fortunately, the fires have damaged no buildings on Hunter Liggett and none are in
    immediate danger. Hunter Liggett, which falls under the control of the U.S. Army Reserve
    Command, serves as a training base encompassing approximately 165,500 acres and is one of
    the largest Army installations in the U.S. </p>
