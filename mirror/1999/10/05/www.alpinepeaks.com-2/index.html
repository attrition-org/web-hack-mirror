<p align="center">Hacked by the DHC</p>
<p align="center">We also have a site: <a href="http://zap.to/dhc">http://zap.to/dhc</a></p>
<p align="center">please don't hack it. :-)</p>
<p align="center">Now for the fun stuff. This got hacked coz I&nbsp; (Nemesystm,
leader of the DHC) felt like finding a vulnerable server to voice my opinion.</p>
<p align="center">Now adays we forget that there is so much wrong happening in
the world. We see murder and rape on the TV and think it's normal, Hell, even
Jerry Springer has it! I feel anger when I see it. Have we forgotten we are
humans? Have we no ideas of all the sickness in this world? Is it so hard to
say: stop! We don't want this no more! I guess it is. Try to help your local
pacifist movements, and remember that you don't need to add to the suffering.
That's my rant. Not that it will help any...</p>
<p align="center">The DHC is a newly formed group who believe in using their own
exploits, tricks and programs instead of being a lame script kiddie. We like
finding new information and new tricks. We like fries, hot dogs and beating up
old people ;-) just like everyone else. The End.</p>

<p align="center">Greets to NYM! Thanks for mentioning me. I'll remember you. If
you don't mind, I retook your server. :-)&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">Spiderfire tells me to tell some people to go and fuck
themselves. :-) I don't agree, that's ok though.</p>
<p align="center">Now the greets to everyone: Hi Underground Havock, 7th
Mafia, Megan (hi ya!), all the other girlies in Canada, my school (I'll see YOU
tomorrow...). Oh, and anyone who will greet me in their next hack will also be greeted next time I hack something.</p>
<p align="center">Now the anti-greets, usually dispensed by my partner in crime
Trinity but today by me: Antionline, Carolyn Meinel, Sinx. (Sorry I'm not buying
your: I ported Netbus to the Mac story. Netbus is lame anyways.) </p>
<p align="center">Liberate all the pacifists.</p>
