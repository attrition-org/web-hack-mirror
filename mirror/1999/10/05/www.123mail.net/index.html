&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1">Human Rights Abuses</font></h1></center>

<center>The scale of the Human Rights abuses in Kashmir is enormous. Most
of the Human Rights&nbsp;</center>

<center>auses that have been reported have been against the Indian security
forces, but the rebel&nbsp;</center>

<center>groups have also been criticised by the international Human Rights
organisations.</center>

<center>Human Rights problems are not new to India and certainly not confined
to the Kashmir region.</center>

<center>Amnesty International has, for years, been concerned with Human
Rights in this country. The Human Rights situation in Kashmir, however,
is far worse than in the rest of the country and deserves special attention.</center>

<center>There are reports of indiscriminate killings of men, women and
children, of unlawful arrests and long spells of time in custody withpout
trial, of deaths and 'disappearances' of people taken into custody, of
the torture of innocent people, including the gang rape of thousands of
women,</center>

<center>of entire villages being burnt, of intimidation in recent elections.
The list seems endless.</center>

<center>Of course not all the claims can be confirmed, but Amnesty International
and other&nbsp;</center>

<center>Human Rights groups have investigated the situation and they all
come to the conclusion that&nbsp;</center>

<center>all these things are happening to a certain extent.</center>

<center>There are several armed pro-Indian groups in Kashmir, supported
by the government and&nbsp;</center>

<center>given virtual impunity to commit Huamn Rights attrocities. There
is also, of course, the&nbsp;</center>

<center>regular army (one sixth of which is stationed in the area). It
is reckoned that the area is&nbsp;</center>

<center>the most militarised in the world.</center>

<center>The various security forces, routinely go into local villages and
towns and round up dozens of young men, taking them away. Most, if not
all of these are tortured. The torture varies from&nbsp;</center>

<center>case to case, with some receiving a lot more than others. Usual
torture techniques include</center>

<center>severe beating, the use of electric shocks and the injection of
needles in various parts of</center>

<center>the body, including the buttocks and the umbilicus. A hospital
has reported that in one year</center>

<center>they treated 40 cases of renal failure due to torture methods.
Heavy rolling devices are often</center>

<center>used to crush arms and legs. Hospitals have reported many cases
of people losing the use&nbsp;</center>

<center>of their limbs and of limbs, especially legs, having to be amputated.
Suspects (who usually</center>

<center>have no links with the rebel groups) are often burn with cigarettes
and some even have their</center>

<center>legs covered in petrol and set alight. Finger nails have been extracted
and chillie powder and</center>

<center>salt have been rubbed into wounds. Victims have been emersed in
freezing water, or scalded. Body parts have been known to have been amputated.</center>

<center>In many cases the victims die through the torture that they receive,
or are killed deliberately&nbsp;</center>

<center>by such means as being burnt alive or being shot in the head. There
is a lot of medical evidence from both survivors and those less fortunate
which has shown that the torture is widespead.</center>

<center>Rape has been reportedly used extremely frequently by the security
forces. There has been a&nbsp;</center>

<center>lot of medical evidence (denied by the Indian government) that
the security forces have raped scores of local women and girls while rounding
up the local men. The worst reported case&nbsp;</center>

<center>of rape happened in February 1991 when over 20 women, between 13-80
were gang&nbsp;</center>

<center>raped. Some of the women were heavily pregnant, later giving birth
to deformed or still-born children. No marriages have taken place in the
town since it happened. There have been&nbsp;</center>

<center>various other reports of multiple rapes of women of all ages (some
as young as 11) and&nbsp;</center>

<center>hundreds of isolated incidents.</center>

<center>The Indian legal framework assists the security forces in carrying
out these abuses. Various</center>

<center>laws have been implemented, giving security forces the right to
shoot to kill and to hold&nbsp;</center>

<center>suspects for up to two years without being charged. There was a
Human Rights watchdog&nbsp;</center>

<center>body set up by the government, but this rarely investigates reports
and when it does, does&nbsp;</center>

<center>not do so efficiently.</center>
