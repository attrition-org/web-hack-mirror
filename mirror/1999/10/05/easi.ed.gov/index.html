<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">well, you are one of those admins: you
never cared about your server's security. you think that only</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">other web sites get attacked and cracked

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">security is something very important.

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">sorry, but it is true. servers get hacked

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">hax0rs don't break into your server and
deface your site because they don't like you and because they want to</font>

have</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to improve your security and to work harder.
defacments are a chance to learn....</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">think about...</font>.
