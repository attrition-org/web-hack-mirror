<font SIZE="+2">KASHMIR ISSUE IN A NUTSHELL</font></h1></center>

<center>&nbsp;The current agitation in Indian-Held Kashmir is rooted in</center>

<center>the struggle of the people for the exercise of the right of</center>

<center>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self-determination. Peaceful processions
chanting</center>

<center>demands for freedom were fired upon by Indian Army</center>

<center>and Police. Hundreds of men, women and children have</center>

<center>been killed or wounded.&nbsp;</center>

<center>New Delhi's allegations of assistance to the Kashmiri</center>

<center>people from the Pakistan side are unfounded. Objective</center>

<center>reports in foreign media testify that the Kashmiri</center>

<center>agitation is indigenous.&nbsp;</center>

<center>Pakistan upholds the right of the people of Jammu and</center>

<center>Kashmir to self-determination in accordance with the</center>

<center>resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.</center>

<center>These resolutions of 1948 and 1949 provide for the</center>

<center>holding of a free and impartial plebiscite for the</center>

<center>determination of the future of the State by the people of</center>

<center>Jammu and Kashmir.&nbsp;</center>

<center>The basic points about the UN resolutions are that :&nbsp;</center>

<center>(i) the complaint relating to Kashmir was initiated by India</center>

<center>in the Security Council ; (ii) the Council explicitly and by</center>

<center>implication, rejected India's claim that Kashmir is legally</center>

<center>Indian territory; (iii) the resolutions established</center>

<center>self-determination as the governing principle for the</center>

<center>settlement of the Kashmir dispute. This is the world</center>

<center>body's commitment to the people of Kashmir ; (iv) the</center>

<center>resolutions endorsed a binding agreement between</center>

<center>India and Pakistan reached through the mediation of</center>

<center>UNCIP, that a plebiscite would be held, under agreed</center>

<center>and specified conditions.&nbsp;</center>

<center>The Security Council has rejected the Indian contention</center>

<center>that the people of Kashmir have exercised their right of</center>

<center>self-determination by participating in the &quot;elections&quot;</center>

<center>which India has from time to time organised in the Held</center>

<center>Kashmir. The 0.2% turn out during the 1989 &quot;elections&quot;</center>

<center>was the most recent clear repudiation of the Indian</center>

<center>claim.&nbsp;</center>

<center>Pakistan continues to adhere to the UN resolutions.</center>

<center>These are binding also on India.&nbsp;</center>

<center>The Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972, to which Pakistan</center>

<center>also continues to adhere, did not alter the status of</center>

<center>Jammu and Kashmir as a disputed territory:&nbsp;</center>

<center>Para 6 of the Agreement lists &quot;a final settlement of</center>

<center>Jammu and Kashmir&quot; as one of the outstanding</center>

<center>questions awaiting a settlement.&nbsp;</center>

<center>Para 4 (ii) talks of a &quot;Line of Control&quot; as</center>

<center>distinguished from an international border.</center>

<center>Furthermore, it explicitly protects &quot;the recognised</center>

<center>position of either side,&quot; The recognised position of</center>

<center>Pakistan is the one which is recognised by the</center>

<center>United Nations and the World Community in</center>

<center>general.&nbsp;</center>

<center>Article I (iv) obviously refers to the Kashmir issue</center>

<center>when it talks of &quot;the basic issues and causes of</center>

<center>conflict which have bedevilled the relations</center>

<center>between the two countries for the last 25 years.&nbsp;</center>

<center>The Simla Agreement does not preclude raising of</center>

<center>Kashmir issue at the United Nations:&nbsp;</center>

<center>Para I (I) specifically provides that the UN Charter</center>

<center>&quot;shall govern&quot; relations between the parties.&nbsp;</center>

<center>Para I (ii) providing for settlement of differences by</center>

<center>peaceful means, does not exclude resort to the</center>

<center>means of pacific settlement of disputes and</center>

<center>differences provided in the UN Charter.&nbsp;</center>

<center>The UN Security Council remains seized of the Kashmir</center>

<center>issue which ermines onf the Council's agenda.&nbsp;</center>

<center>Articles 34 and 35 of the UN Charter specifically</center>

<center>empower the Security Council to investigate any dispute</center>

<center>independently or at the request of a member State.</center>

<center>These provisions cannot be made subservient to any</center>

<center>bilateral agreement.&nbsp;</center>

<center>According to Article 103 of the UN Charter, member</center>

<center>States obligations under the Charter take precedence</center>

<center>over obligations under a bilateral agreement.&nbsp;</center>

<center>Presence of United Nations Military Observers Group in</center>

<center>India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) at the Line of Control in</center>

<center>Kashmir is a clear evidence off UN's involvement in the</center>

<center>Kashmir issue.&nbsp;</center>

<center>Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory. It dies not</center>

<center>involve the principle of respect for the unity and</center>

<center>territorial integrity of states, to which Pakistan adheres.&nbsp;</center>

<center>Attempts to forcibley suppress the legitimate demands</center>

<center>of the people of Jammu and Kashmir are doomed to</center>

<center>failure. Similarly, threats of use of force will not affect</center>

<center>Pakistan's resolve to maintain its position of principle.&nbsp;</center>
