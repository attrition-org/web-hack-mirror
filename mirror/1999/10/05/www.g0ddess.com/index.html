    Sorry for any hasstle but I thaught that I might get 
    your attention on this issue before those 3nh.com (3lite Network Hackers) bastards
    got in here and rm'ed all of your files... Anywase just thaught that I'd 
    bring it to your attention that you were rather vulnerable.  I haven't changed any
    thing on the original index.html ;; just delete this index.html and change index.old 
    to index.html.  I'll leave it up to you to figure out your weak-point in security.
    That shouldn't be a hard task.
</p>

Also, might I suggest switching to openBSD for your server?  It's kernel was built
with security in mind... so were all the apps that are compiled for it... And it it 
wouldn't hurt to check up on NTbugtraq.com occasionally if you decide not to make the 
switch.
