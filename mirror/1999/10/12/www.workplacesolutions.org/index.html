Your defacements are boring, redundant, and pointless. (this one is just as pointless)<br>
By the time you disappeared no one read your defacements anymore anyway. (nobody will care bout this one either)<br><br><br>
<br><br><i>Can't say we missed you! (can't miss me cuz nobody know who the fuck i am, cuz ima lehmer.)</i>

Stop cluttering up attrition.org with your non-sense war on authority.
(this hack is just a pointless and i submitted it to attrition too)Besides, how many vulnerable cold fusion boxes could possibly be left?(this one was also done by me with CF)
By now I would have thought you'd learn linux or *BSD.(this defacement was done with a windows 98 box and IE5)
Oh yeah, and your backdoor's gone too.(so,forpaxe backdoor is gone...heh. i made a new one)
