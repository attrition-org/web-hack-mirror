        <p align="center">Hi, Nemesystm is back with a couple of hacks for the
        DHC.</p>
        <p align="center">Levelseven made a interesting point when it claimed
        that the Frontpage exploit isn't a hack. I beg to disagree, I feel that
        it in reality is a true hack. yes, it's easy, but so is running any
        other program, code, etc. And even though many will deny it, a lot of
        the hacks these days are hacks through this way. I'm still in a learning
        phase, if you guys/girls would know how old I was, you wouldn't be
        complaining. :-) Now for the more deeper stuff.</p>
        <p align="center">THIS MORNING.<br>
        I woke up this morning,<br>
        and it was quite clear.<br>
        Our future is uncertain,<br>
        and our death can be near.</p>
        <p align="center">Anyways, the DHC has expanded yet again, today I can
        proudly say that we have Spiderfire amongst us. Life is good. Trinity,
        plz come back soon! Members at the moment are: Nemesystm (me), Trinity,
        Caesar, Slash, Dark Plague, Aero, Zanith, and ofcourse Spiderfire.</p>
