Hello Chinese people.  Do you guys actually realise how fucking dictated to
you are? Do you realise how homosexual your leader is?  He looks exactly
like the kind of person who goez crusin' in horse-and-cart (that's what
you guys drive rite) every night looking for a hot piece of male ass.  He
thought he looked all cool last week at the anniversary celebrations, but
when you think about it, he's going down. Because democracy
is coming your way.  There's no way a communist society can survive when
it's population is so bloated and poverty struck.  Russia, anyone? Oh
yeah, speaking of chinese people, Vivian Chong (phone: 001 408 749 1360)
really sucks.
