        <p align="center">Hi, Nemesystm is back with a couple of hacks for the
        DHC</p>
        <p align="center">(this must be starting to annoy some people)</p>
        <p align="center">CHRISTIAN.<br>
        You call someone a fat pig behind his back. It's OK you're a Christian and he ain't, right?<br>
        You call someone a whore behind her back. It's OK you're a Christian and she ain't, right?<br>
        Well it's not allright, those people have done you no harm you Christian. Those people aren't here to defend themselves, but YOU are a Christian. Those people have never spoken a bad word about you, on the contrary they've always helped you, but their not Christians, and that makes you better right?<br>
        And you say you don't do it, but you do and you don't see it and God will see it, and I betcha that he will be good upon those non-Christians and you'll think that Satan is helping them. O boy are you in for a surprise because they are better than you. You Christian.</p>
        <p align="center">Anyways, the DHC has expanded yet again, today I can
        proudly say that we have Spiderfire amongst us. Life is good. Trinity,
