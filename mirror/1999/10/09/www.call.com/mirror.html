        <p align="center">Hi, Nemesystm is back with a couple of hacks for the
        DHC</p>
        <p align="center">Levelseven made a interesting point when it claimed
        that the Frontpage exploit isn't a hack. I beg to disagree, I feel that
        it in reality is a true hack. yes, it's easy, but so is running any
        other program, code, etc. And even though many will deny it, a lot of
        the hacks these days are hacks through this way. I'm still in a learning
        phase, if you guys/girls would know how old I was, you wouldn't be
        complaining. :-) Now for the more deeper stuff.</p>
        <p align="center">SCARED<br>
        God I'm scared he said as he had shot six people and then put the gun in his own mouth. And this really happened.<br>
        I'm scared I say as I try to hide away and I just can't. I'm not being bugged and have a normal popularity, but oh I'm so scared. Scared of social contact, scared of the war.<br>
        It hurts to see friends being social outcasts, It hurts to know that we as society have created another vengefull freak out to get us all.<br>
        I'm scared I say as I think of what he asked me to do. "Can you arrange a gun?"<br>
        I'm scared I say as I think of what I answered. "I'll take care of it."<br>
        I'm scared I say because we act like it's normal when it's not, and we all damn well know it shouldn't be but I'm so scared and you don't care. You have your own problems. Bigger problems than mine. And I know I shouldn't complain: "In Somalia people are worse off"<br>
        Well FUCK you, I'm so scared and I'm not going to ignore it. This world is sick and so am I and I'm going to stay. I will not go the easy way and kill myself. I won't do it, you don't deserve it!</p>
        <p align="center">Anyways, the DHC has expanded yet again, today I can
        proudly say that we have Spiderfire amongst us. Life is good. Trinity,
