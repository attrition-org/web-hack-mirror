                <div align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TO BE A REAL 
                  NEW YORKER, one has to, among other requirements, love New York. 
                  That is, Manhattan, specifically. And though it is the fashion 
                  capital of a fashionable country, teeming with design houses 
                  and the creative minds within them, and catering to the best 
                  shops and shoppers, stylists and fashion editors, you'd be surprised, 
                  there aren't an awful lot of New York shoe designers. As in 
                  shoe designers who are real New Yorkers. As in Reed Evins. <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reed Evins was born on E. 66th 
                  Street at New York Hospital. He grew up on E. 49th Street. He 
                  lives on E. 57th Street in a beautiful oasis of serenity, what 
                  he terms his "boot box in the sky," soon to be overhauled by 
                  minimalist designer/ architect John Pawson (who also did the 
                  Hong Kong airport, Calvin Klein's Madison Avenue boutique and 
                  Reed's sister's apartment). Perched 35 stories above the frenetic 
                  chaos of the city's hulking power, glittering wealth, and its 
                  gorgeous, outrageous style, among his meditative Buddhas and 
                  contemplative still photography, windows showcasing the metropolitan 
                  drama through a long-range lens, he designs his wonderful shoes. 
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may remember the name Evins 
                  aligned with haute couture from earlier in this century. Reed's 
                  father Lee and uncle David both designed classic shoes in the 
                  '40s and '50s for movie stars like Audrey Hepburn, Judy Garland, 
                  Grace Kelly, as well as every first lady from the Eisenhower 
                  administration on. It is this legacy he carries on today in 
                  the second season of his new line, Reed Evins Salon Collection. 
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evins has been designing shoes 
                  his entire 19-year career with help from his sister, Melissa. 
                  Melissa is a year older, his best friend and business manager, 
                  with exquisite taste and an unerring eye for color; she helps 
                  keep him in line. They communicate wordlessly at this point 
                  in their relationship, just a raised eyebrow and he knows immediately 
                  what she is thinking. Self-described, "adorable," Reed actually 
                  is quite that in real life, handsome and strong-featured with 
                  a hyperactive energy that sends him leaping over furniture and 
                  tossing<img src="../shuzarticlesimagesfall99/reed8a.jpg" align="right" width="240" height="213"> 
                  his next season's sketches fluttering through the air for emphasis. 
                  He maintains that Melissa is equally cute, but far more even-tempered; 
                  everyone loves her. <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What he culled as a child from 
                  the creative imagination of his father and uncle, and from his 
                  mother's untrained elegance (she was, as he puts it, "incredibly 
                  chic"), he put to use. He designed ballet slippers in Brooklyn, 
                  then started, with his sister, his very popular and successful 
                  young and funky company, Two City Kids (comparatively much "funkier" 
                  than his present designs), and then for various designers, the 
                  first Calvin Klein shoe collection, Halston and Anne Klein II. 
                  Obviously, coming from a shoe design background would shape 
                  one's sensibility, but he insists his mother's flair and culture 
                  trained his aesthetic. They did not watch TV, ever. Had a box 
                  at the New York City Ballet, which he still uses on Saturday 
                  nights. They attended poetry readings, classical concerts and 
                  galleries as children. Dressed in velvet for Park Avenue birthday 
                  parties. Then he went to Rhode Island School of Design, where 
                  he polished his craft and eye. An underachiever in high school 
                  (or as he characterizes it, he failed everything), he decided 
                  early on he was bored and wanted something more creative. A 
                  component of the RISD entrance examination was an impromptu 
                  object sketch. Here Reed encounters a football field filled 
                  with tables. A gong sounds and the cloths are removed from 500 
                  hidden objects. To his right a girl has to draw the backbone 
                  of a skeletal bird. To his left a boy begins to sketch a stack 
                  of books. And what is revealed in front of Reed? A lady's high-heeled 
                  shoe. As if fate hadn't already forced the point, he finishes 
                  his sketch in 3 minutes. (The applicants were given eight hours 
                  to complete and submit their drawings.) He was accepted on early 
                  admission, confident he was on the right path. Filling his father's 
                  shoes, following in his footsteps . . . . How often do these 
                  expressions so literally apply? He and Melissa had reason to 
                  be assured that their recent launch of the Reed Evins line would 
                  be a remarkably successful venture, as Dawn Mello, president 
                  of Bergdorf Goodman, practically begged him to do it. Her support 
                  and the total conviction of Cynthia Marcus and Tim Davis at 
                  Neiman Marcus that he would find his niche gave him further 
                  confidence. They all discussed what they were both looking to 
                  <img src="../shuzarticlesimagesfall99/reed7a.jpg" align="left" width="260" height="225">find 
                  on the shoe design scene, namely a classic, luxury-detailed 
                  feminine shoe of unparalleled quality that evoked the appeal 
                  of his uncle, David Evins' collection, but was updated, too. 
                  By detail he means hand embroidery, seed pearls, real gold-leaf 
                  soles, rich pristine fabrics, petit point, soutash and jewels. 
                  The things you find embedded in your favorite tiara glittering 
                  on your feet. And all this, mind you, by an American, a New 
                  York designer. <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His shoes are individually built, 
                  a skill in which Evins takes great pride as it distinguishes 
                  him from the myriad sketchers and visionaries, because he knows 
                  how to build shoes from nothing, a time-honored, but forgotten 
                  art. Not only is the manufacture necessarily painstaking, but 
                  the elements are of the finest quality; the gold is real gold 
                  leaf embedded in the heel; the silk is not the typical rayon 
                  mix, but pure silk velvet. And the elements are the sumptuous 
                  scraps of a palace cobbler: taffeta, suede, grosgrain, pashmina, 
                  ariana, pony, lizard, charmeuse and mink. Yes, he makes mink 
                  pumps in seven colors! And velvet mules dotted with carrion 
                  pearls re-embroidered with lace. But he is quick to point out 
                  that, although studded with riches, the design is inherently 
                  simple, a sheared 1-inch stiletto heel (as opposed to a short 
                  chunky one), lends a practical height to a feminine and sexy 
                  needle-toed shape. Evins likes minimalistic, classical structure 
                  and is equally proud of a ballet slipper, void of detail to 
                  the exclusion of stitch or seam. <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evins also designs luxury accessories: 
                  bags and scarves among them. His pashmina scarves retail for 
                  over $2,000-some are exquisite interpretations of 18th-century 
                  French carpets come to life in the delicate weave of the finest 
                  gossamer-weight pashmina in the world, according to Anna Wintour 
                  of Vogue. Others have white overlaid embroidery stitched with 
                  700 seed pearls on snow white version from the same coveted 
                  fabric. It's no surprise that his clients are royalty. Queen 
                  Sophie of Spain ordered 150 pashmina scarves to give as gifts, 
                  and Princess Caroline of Monaco is a loyal royal fan. <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His inspiration is the glamour 
                  of the past, vintage Hollywood, (and luckily Evins has maintained 
                  a museum-quality archive of over 3,000 pairs of shoes worn by 
                  famous women or designed by his favorite designers, besides 
                  himself-his father and uncle). Or <img src="../shuzarticlesimagesfall99/reed4a.jpg" align="right" width="235" height="243">whatever 
                  else may spark his fancy: The view from the dizzying height 
                  of his glass house, the occasional sumptuous film, like Elizabeth, 
                  The Piano or Room with a View, the diamond exhibit at the American 
                  Museum of Natural History, or just whatever thrills him, running 
                  dizzily pell-mell down the spirally coils of the Guggenheim 
                  conch. He admits that he's more of an uptown person, not particularly 
                  impressed with SoHo, not trendy, not millennium-obsessed, but 
                  rather, his imagination lavish with intricate and decadent detail, 
                  a by-gone glamorous opulence.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he travels to Italy 
                  several times a year, it is not this aspect of the glamorous 
                  world of fashion he relishes. He hates airplanes and airports 
                  and all associated with them. Is highly sensitive to all tastes 
                  and smells, apparently not the place for the delicate aesthetic. 
                  Although he says he's not as bad as Marlene Dietrich was. (She 
                  used to put her mink coat down on the stage to have something 
                  clean to kneel on.) And Italy is a lot of work. He and Melissa 
                  are there two or three weeks, poring over the finishing touches. 
                  When asked if he loves going there, he laughs. Apparently, even 
                  Italy can get a little dull after 20 years. Where he does love 
                  to go is the unexplored and the exotic: India and Nairobi are 
                  his most recent adventures, and he and Melissa are off to Mongolia 
                  this summer. For "light" travel, they love the beach, particularly 
                  Anguilla. <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His apartment is a museum of 
                  shoes, the 3,000 or so vintage pairs he's collected, stored 
                  in an unprecedented number of closets. Among them, turquoise 
                  and silver brocade stretch stiletto boots, signed by Loretta 
                  Young, 1973. Lena Horne, Jamaica slippers, 1962. Claudette Colbert 
                  sandals from Cleopatra, 1933. Rita Hayworth's ankle straps from 
                  her bathing beauty wartime footlocker poster, 1945. Photos of 
                  Audrey Hepburn in her Sabrina mules, designed by his uncle, 
                  David Evins. And Grace Kelly, in his uncle's studio, looking 
                  over sketches of shoes, specially made for her. There are ancient 
                  carpet-hewn slippers from Turkey, a 1930s pair of Bally pumps, 
                  Polish wool peasant slippers and the first shoe ever to grace 
                  a magazine cover, Herbert Levine's gold-heeled Kabuki clogs 
                  on Harper's Bazaar in the early '60s. There are photos from 
                  his travels, bringing bales of fabric on a mule cart through 
                  a shrapnel-littered war zone. A chair entirely made of buttons. 
                  A sofa graffittied over with Reed's own designs, lessons his 
                  father taught him, "the three basic bows (grosgrain, jewel butterfly 
                  and tuxedo), the basic heels: (Louis, Cuban, Stiletto, spikes, 
                  wedges, ballet), etc.," drawn in marker on every cushion, autographed 
                  by his friends, his fans and other designers.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too often, what is hip or sleek 
                  or modern loses in translation what was pretty or delicate or 
                  petal-pink, princessy feminine. No <img src="../shuzarticlesimagesfall99/reed3a.jpg" align="left" width="250" height="344">one 
                  in the industry is embroidering tiny pink and lilac rosebud 
                  satin stitches on every dainty toe, sewing ribbons together 
                  lengthwise, stringing pearls into strappy To-Catch-A- Thief 
                  Monaco-plush sandals, and reinterpreting them into summer thongs 
                  with turquoise beads, glamour for the beach. <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was also the film To Catch 
                  A Thief that inspired the Reed Evins packaging: black boxes 
                  with a gold stripe, and signature gold soles, like Cary Grant's 
                  loafers (which he also owns). <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understatement is his mode for 
                  the year 2000. While everyone else is over the top, in Space 
                  Odyssey techno-cool, Reed's shoes are a tribute to the previous 
                  century. Evening sandals he's designed for the millennium collection 
                  have jewels embedded in the soles, just a sparkle or flash as 
                  you kick up your heels, dancing at the ball, or kneeling in 
                  church. Your very own understated rendition of "diamonds on 
                  the soles of your shoes." <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things are looking up for Reed 
                  Evins these days. Luxury department stores are ordering thousands 
                  of pairs of his shoes in advance of even seeing a sketch. They 
                  tell him, "go ahead, make it, whatever your vision is, that's 
                  what we're ordering." And he is beyond thrilled. "Years," he 
                  says, "you wait to hear this. That this is truly your baby, 
                  your chance to do your own thing. Be true to yourself," he says, 
                  knowingly. And surveying his pie-in-the-sky personal shoe gallery, 
                  the fabled "If you build it, they will come" Zen adage seems 
                  fitting. To understand this man's vision, is to be grateful 
                  the fashion world has adopted him so enthusiastically. </div>
