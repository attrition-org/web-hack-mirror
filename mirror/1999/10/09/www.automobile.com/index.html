        <p align="center">Hi, Nemesystm is back with a couple of hacks.</p>
        <p align="center">Levelseven made a interesting point when it claimed
        that the Frontpage exploit isn't a hack. I beg to disagree, I feel that
        it in reality is a true hack. yes, it's easy, but so is running any
        other program, code, etc. And even though many will deny it, a lot of
        the hacks these days are hacks through this way. I'm still in a learning
        phase, if you guys/girls would know how old I was, you wouldn't be
        complaining. :-) Now for the more deeper stuff.</p>
        <p align="center">YOUR PETTY PROBLEMS.<br>
        Have you ever thought of all the pain in the world, imagining you go through it yourself;<br>
        the break-up of a friend with his girlfriend, the starving children in the street, that legless<br>
        man in the corner, the American soldier who is fighting the wars for us?<br>
        All their pain grabs your heart and tears you up if you really realize it, but you complain about
        your life being tough; Oh my batteries have run out, the TV is broken, This coke is warm,
        Goddammit, don't you think that your friend wishes he was drinking that coke with his girlfriend
        again, or that the American soldier doesn't long for a coke on his couch at home?
        And all you do is complain is about petty problems not worth mentioning.<br>
        Be proud. You should be. After all, at least you can complain...</p>
        <p align="center">Anyways, the DHC has expanded yet again, today I can
        proudly say that we have Spiderfire amongst us. Life is good. Trinity,
