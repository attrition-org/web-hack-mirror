Dear Members of the Army Dental Care Family:<br><br>
On the 27th of May I will be promoted to the grade of Major General and installed as Deputy Surgeon General, 23rd Chief of the Army Dental Corps, and Chief of Staff, USAMEDCOM. I am both proud and humbled by this honor. I am proud to be a leader of the AMEDD and in particular the Chief of the Army Dental Care System. I am humbled to know that I follow in the footsteps of the great Dental Chiefs who have preceded me. They have established a legacy of excellence which will be my privilege to uphold and foster.<br><br>
During the month of April I was able to visit the Dental Activities of Europe and to participate in the Dental Management/Commanders' Conference in Garmisch.  Every where I visited, I saw proof of the value of Army Dentistry.  Our people - officers, enlisted and civilians - are esteemed professionals and leaders in their communities.  The dental soldiers of the European Regional Dental Command and 93rd Medical Battalion were extremely busy supporting routine dental services while simultaneously supporting operations in the Balkans.  I was very proud of all that I saw and heard.<br><br>
At the Garmisch Dental Management/Commanders Conference, I shared my vision for Army Dentistry and will repeat it now:  Army Dentistry:<br><br>   
The Best Dental System anywhere!<br><br>
-- Highly efficient<br>
-- Highly productive<br>
-- Superb morale<br>
-- Outstanding training<br><br>
I also provided indicators that we could use to measure our movement towards the accomplishment of our vision:<br><br>
-- Every soldier attains Class I in first tour<br>
-- Class I total > 60%<br>
-- Recruitment and Retention increased; we have a choice in who we retain<br>
-- Education programs receive outstanding reviews<br>
-- Quality research is measured by products and peer reviewed reports and publications.<br><br>
This vision is really not a great stretch for an organization as outstanding as the Army Dental Care System, but it does place a premium on productivity and efficiency.  The Dental Corps is at its smallest size in recent history but our mission continues to grow.  This requires that every dental officer be vigorously engaged in clinical practice to the maximum extent possible.  This entails that OIC's and dental clinic commanders delegate administrative matters to their NCOIC's, and that Dental commanders maximize the use of MSC XO's for administrative support.  OIC's and Dental Clinic commanders should strive to provide eight hours of clinical practice daily.  It is recognized that other duties may occasionally conflict, but conflicts must be minimized.  Tier I  DENTAC Commanders should seek to spend 80% of their regular duty day engaged in clinical practice.  Tier II  DENTAC Commanders should strive for a majority of their time in clinical practice.  Regional Dental Commanders should continue to practice but I anticipate that it will be less than 50% of their time.<br><br>
We recently received good news on the implementation of the multi-year retention bonus for specialists.  I hope that all those eligible will avail themselves of the opportunity to sign on for four more years.  It is a good deal for the officers and a good deal for the Army.  However, the increased level of special pay engenders increased scrutiny of our productivity.  Clearly the multi-year retention bonus was targeted at clinical specialists.  The anticipation was that clinical practice would be advanced by retaining clinicians.  This has provided just one more reason to emphasize the productivity of Dental officers; however, the most important reason for productivity remains that it is the right thing to do.  We must be productive and efficient in maximizing dental outcomes - dental readiness and total oral health.  This is our mission and it is our privilege to accomplish this mission for the soldiers who serve this nation as well.<br><br>
Our Surgeon General, LTG Ronald Blanck was in the forefront of our struggle for the multi-year retention bonus.  We would not have been successful without his zealous support.  He is a great advocate of Army Dentistry.  General Blanck has provided his azimuth for the remainder of his time as TSG and MEDCOM Commander.  He has outlined his 4 P's - Productivity, Prevention, Practice Guidelines and People.  Clearly our vision is in synch with his azimuth.  He and I both believe that people are the most important of the 4 P's.  Sustaining a command climate of trust, compassion, and selfless service is the hallmark of both the AMEDD and the Army Dental Care System.  Every minute of our day is focused on supporting the major subordinate commands and their superb professionals with the resources - personnel, financial, and information - that they require to provide quality health care and health services.<br><br>
I wish to extend my sincere appreciation and congratulations to MG (Ret) John J. Cuddy for his superb service as Deputy Surgeon General and Chief, Army Dental Corps.  His accomplishments are many and he remains revered within the AMEDD.  I will miss seeing him on a regular basis, but I know that he still loves and supports Army Dentistry and will always be an available resource to you.<br><br>
I also wish to congratulate COL(P) Joe Webb for his selection to serve as Brigadier General and assignment as Assistant Surgeon General for Force Sustainment.  Well done, Joe, you will be a great asset to the General Officers ranks.<br><br>
In closing, I wish to thank all of the members of the Army Dental Care System for the sacrifice that you make for our nation.  I am very grateful for your service and very proud to be your leader.<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
PATRICK D. SCULLEY<br>
BG(P), U.S. Army<br>
Chief, Army Dental Corps<br>
