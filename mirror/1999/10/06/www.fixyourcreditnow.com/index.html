<FONT SIZE=+0>Torture and deaths in Custody</FONT></H1></CENTER>

<CENTER>Victims in custody are, in effect, treated as bodies of flesh and
bones. The punishment starts&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>at the time of arrest; abusive language is used and rifle-butts
are struck on their legs. In the interrogation centres they are tortured
by some methods only unique to the Indian army.</CENTER>

<CENTER>They detainees are crushed under road-rollers, they are made to
drink their own urine,</CENTER>

<CENTER>they are hung up-side-down until they get gangrene in the feet
and go blind. Live flames and electric shock are applied to the detainees'
bodies. Some detainees are cut with a knife,</CENTER>

<CENTER>one slash at a time, until they faint. The bodies which are returned
to the relatives, have&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>born the tell tale scars of torture. The last count of deaths in
custody was 887. The number&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>of bodies recovered from river Jhelum is 287 whereas figure for
those injured or disabled</CENTER>

<CENTER>for life stands at 23,558. Case histories will exemplify the modus
operandi of the&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>Indian forces:</CENTER>

<CENTER>Munshi Ghulam Nabi was a civil servant in the Irrigation department.
Following the</CENTER>

<CENTER>usual cordon and search operation in his village Redwani Kulgam
Kashmir by JAK</CENTER>

<CENTER>Riffles, Munshi was picked up for no other reason than tending
a beard.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Relatives pleaded for his return, but the army said that he would
be released after</CENTER>

<CENTER>questioning. Ten long months passed; there was no word on Munshi.
A</CENTER>

<CENTER>heavy rainfall caused a breach in the banks of the canal at Babapora.
the water washed</CENTER>

<CENTER>away the earth covering the body, identified as that of Munshi.
An eye-witness on the</CENTER>

<CENTER>scene said that the body had marks of gruesome torture. The site
was near the army camp.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Nothing has ever come of any protest lodged by the relatives. Munshi
is one more innocent</CENTER>

<CENTER>victim of genocide perpetrated in the state.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Around midnight , the whole of Zanirag Khrew village was woken
up by gun</CENTER>

<CENTER>shots. Ghulam Nabi Lone, 24 years old and worker of the Khrew cement
factory, was</CENTER>

<CENTER>arrested by the army Co. No. 312 stationed at Khrew. The army officers
were angry after an</CENTER>

<CENTER>encounter with some 'militants'. They got Lone, took him to the
nearby fields, beat him up and</CENTER>

<CENTER>killed him on the spot, for no reason other than to act as a deterrent
for the 'militants'.</CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=+0>Torture and its aftermath</FONT></H2></CENTER>

<CENTER>Thousands of tortured victims wander around with scars and deformities.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Bashir Ahmed Mir, 19 years old from Laduo, Pulwama, had his operation;
his&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>both feet were amputated. "I was kept standing on snow for six
hours with my</CENTER>

<CENTER>bare feet buried in. Returning to the interrogation centre they
beat me up with bamboo</CENTER>

<CENTER>sticks. After two days, some white fluid started oozing out from
my toes and they turned</CENTER>

<CENTER>black. I was in acute pain", narrated Bashir to Dr Zubair at the
Bone &amp; Joint hospital,</CENTER>

<CENTER>Srinagar. The frost-bite was allowed to fester for two months in
detention. He has his</CENTER>

<CENTER>operation one day after his release. Bashir, like many thousands
of young people crippled,</CENTER>

<CENTER>cannot support his elderly parents, having lost both his feet.</CENTER>

<CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=+0>Tihar Jail</FONT></H3></CENTER>

<CENTER>The jail in Dehli is the most notorious prison in India and houses
40 Kashmiri men. On India's</CENTER>

<CENTER>republic day, the inmates of the prison are paraded in front of
the Indian flag and made to sing the</CENTER>

<CENTER>Indian national anthem.</CENTER>

<CENTER>One prisoner, Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, refused to sing. He was severely
beaten until he lost</CENTER>

<CENTER>his consciousness. He was admitted to hospital and barely survived.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Prisoners from Kashmir have been spread all over India as far away
from their relatives as possible. Allahbad prison has 24 Kashmiri prisoners.
The 22 Kashmiris in Jodhpur jail were blind-folded when a delegation of
lawyers visited them.</CENTER>

<CENTER>The prisons in the J&amp;K state are full.</CENTER>

<CENTER>There is a case for a demand to treat prisoners from Kashmir as
POWs, because Kashmir</CENTER>

<CENTER>is not in a civil war. Being a disputed territory, prisoners taken
from within Kashmir are&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>not citizens of India.</CENTER>
