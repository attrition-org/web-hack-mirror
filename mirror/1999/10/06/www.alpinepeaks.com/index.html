<p>Note to the level 7 crew </p>

<p>That was not the hardiest way to get into a server <br>
Not that you are not bringing up a valid point about security <br>
Because the security here is light and they really should do something about that <br>
But stop harassing them maybe I will e-mail the admin with some pointers</p>

<p>Talk to ya later all you<br>
can find more pointers at Undernet<br>
just ask juarez <br>
