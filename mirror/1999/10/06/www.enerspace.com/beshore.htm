<p align="center"><font color="#0000FF" size="5"><strong>BOESHORE (BESHORE) FAMILY HISTORY</strong></font></p>

<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="_themes/global/glohorsa.gif" width="300" height="10"></p>

<p align="left"><img src="WB01062_.GIF" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15"> Presented here is a brief history of the Boeshore
family, which will be of interest to all descendants of Matthias Frantz and his wife,
Elizabeth Boeshore.<br>
<br>
<img src="WB01062_.GIF" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15">&nbsp; The original name of Le Baisseur is of French origin. It
literally means &quot;one who kisses&quot;. Whether this family trait persists in the
present generation can best be asked and answered by each one who reads. The name has
changed through the years by contact with English and German speaking peoples and has
variously been written as Le Baisseur, Baisseur, Besor, Bashair, Beashore, Basehore and
Boeshore.<br>
<br>
<img src="WB01062_.GIF" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15"> One Jaques Milne Le Baisseur, a French Huguenot, fled from his
home in Guyenne (an area and former province in southwest France) to England about 1610.
This was after the horrible massacre of St. Bartholomew which started in Paris in 1572,
and which caused intense persecutions of all the French Protestants. In 1614, he was
enrolled as a member of the French Huguenot Church in Norwich, England. From here, about a
century later, some of the descendants of Jacques, in 1708, left for New York State,
arriving in Schoharie Valley, along the Hudson River. </p>

<p align="left"><img src="WB01062_.GIF" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15"> This was the period when Queen Anne of England
encouraged the French Huguenots and Palatines to go to New York State instead of to
Pennsylvania. Her plan was to populate the Hudson Valley so as to provide a better defense
against the marauding French and Indians, in what is know as Queen Anne's French and
Indian War. This war was really an extension of the War of the Spanish Succession then
going on in Europe(Stapleton).</p>

<p align="left"><img src="WB01062_.GIF" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15"> About the same time this Boeshore family met with
Conrad Weiser and other Palatines and Huguenots in New York State in 1720 and joined the
Scholorie immigration to the Tulpehocken country of Berks county in Pennsylvania. This
route followed from Lake Oswego in New York State, thence down the Susquehanna river to
the mouth of the Swatara and thence up the Swatara to the Tulpehocken section. One of the
Boeshores who was active in this group was Mathias Basehore, born about 1700. The
historian, Rupp, to whom we are indebted for much of our information on the Palatine and
Huguenot immigrants, is descended from this Mathias Basehore. Rupp later became a famous
Indian fighter in the following French and Indian Wars. (Rupp)<br>
<br>
<img src="WB01062_.GIF" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15"> Another branch of the Le Baisser family in Norwich returned to
the Alsace and Bas Rhine sections about 1700. This entire section, comprising two
provinces, was now in France, and was more or less protected from the severity of
religious persecution. This area was predominantly German-speaking and had belonged to the
Hapsburgs. But the treaty of Westphalia of 1684, which ended the thirty year war in
Europe, separated these German provinces west of the Rhine and gave them to France. This
treaty guaranteed the Edict of Nantes and when this Edict was revoked by the French
Government, the revocation did no apply to this area -- hence, the many Huguenots in these
provinces.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/yl_tri.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="10"> Among this group to settle in the Bas Rhine and Alsace was
Jacob Boeshaar (Baisseur), a cooper by trade. He settled in the town of Deux Ponts (Two
Bridges) in France in 1720. The town of Deux Ponts in now Zweibrucken in the Saar in
Germany. A son John George Boeshore or later spelled Bashair, born 1717, emigrated to
America about 1735, settling in Tulpehocken Twp. In 1738 he married Catherine Stump. John
George was the ancestor of the Schuylkill County and Tulpehocken Boeshores while the
Mathias referred to above was the ancestor of the Lebanon and Dauphin County group (Rupp).
These two branches of the same (Le Baisseur) family set out from the ancestral home in
Guyenne, France about 1610 and by different paths arrived at the same place in the
Tulpehocken country in Pennsylvania, thousands of miles away, across an ocean, and a
century later, about 1732.<br>
<br>
<img src="WB01062_.GIF" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15"> August 30, 1738, John George Bashir was granted a Proprietary
Patent by Thomas Penn for 208 acres in Bethel Township, adjoining Tulpehocken, and
situated along Little Swatara Creek (Pennsylvania Archives). In 1745, along with the
families of Christian Frantz II, John Frantz and Michael Frantz, John George Bashair
helped to organize the Church of the Brethren (then German Baptist Brethren, or Dunkers)
in Tulpehocken, along the Little Swatara (Brumbaugh). He paid taxes on the property
mentioned above from 1754 to 1781 (Pennsylvania Archives) and died in 1786, his will being
recorded in February 1787 in the Berks County Courthouse. John George Bashair and his
wife, Maria, had the following children: Michael, Maria, Catherine, George, Jacob, Daniel,
Marie, Elizabeth and John.<br>
<br>
<img src="WB01062_.GIF" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15"> Jacob Boeshore (II), the son of John George, was born in Berks
County about 1740. In 1770, he was an active member of the Little Swatara Congregation of
the Church of the Brethren, became a minister before 1790 and a Elder in the active charge
of the Church before 1800. He was taxable on his father's land in Bethel, 1782-1790. In
1780 and 1781, he served as a private in Captain Wolf's Company of Berk's County Militia
during the Revolutionary War (Pennsylvania Archives).<br>
<br>
<img src="WB01062_.GIF" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15">&nbsp; Jacob Boeshore married Christina Alderfer, the daughter of
Frederick Alderfer who came to the country in the Ship Samuel, landing in Philadelphia,
august 11, 1732. This is the same ship which brought our Christian Frantz I and his
family, and also John George Bahair the father of Jacob. On June 4, 1776, he obtained a
Proprietary Patent for a tract of land in Pine Grove Township (now Schuylkill county)
across the Blue Mountain from Millersburg (now Bethel), which he named on this property
1775-1785 (Pennsylvania Archives). The U.S. Census of 1790 listed him as resident of
Berkes County (Schuylkill county not being formed until 1811) with a family of four sons
and five daughters. He died in 1815 and his will was recorded on September 27,1815, in the
Berkes County Court House. Jacob and his wife, Christina, had the following children: Anna
Maria, Christina, Elizabeth, Lydia, George, Benjamin, Michael, Jacob, Catharine.<br>
<br>
<img src="WB01062_.GIF" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15"> Elizabeth Boeshore, daughter of Jacob, was born, in Guienne in
Pine Grove Township, then Berks County, on July 31, 1771, and Matthias (IV) Frantz. It is
further interest that on April 18, 1791 Matthias purchased Guienne, the plantation and
birthplace of Elizabeth. Guienne remained in the possession of the Frantz family for some
time. (Berkes County Courthouse, and Publications of the Huguenot Society of Pennsylvania
at Philadelphia).<br>
