		<P><BR>
		This message come to your from Janet James, manager of your beautiful UU <BR>
		camp, de Benneville Pines.<BR>
		<BR>
		Summer is here, and so goes the crazy schedule of camp.  I could sure use <BR>
		some help with the maintenance end of things.  I have Craig's Cabin available <BR>
		for most of July.  I am hoping that there are a few of you who would like to <BR>
		come up for one, two or three days and help with some important projects.<BR>
		<BR>
		1)  Staining the rails on the decks<BR>
		2)  Painting a fence or two<BR>
		3)  Painting fire hydrants<BR>
		4)  Rebuilding a fence<BR>
		5)  Rescreening a few windows<BR>
		6)  Staining cupboards in cabin #6<BR>
		7)  Sewing covers for the rocking chairs in Craig's Cabin (9 sets of pads to <BR>
		be covered)<BR>
		8)  Filling potholes in the road<BR>
		<BR>
		the list can go on.........<BR>
		<BR>
		With the exception of July 2 - 5 and July 9 - 17, Craig's Cabin is not being <BR>
		used and is a very nice place to stay.  Food service is available Sunday <BR>
		dinner through Saturday breakfast with the exception of July 5 - 9, when the <BR>
		kitchen is closed.<BR>
		<BR>
		Any time you can spare would really help us out.  The week of July 5 - 9 are <BR>
		perfect days for us to have volunteers in camp, but you would need to cook <BR>
		for yourself in the kitchen of Craig's Cabin since our new staff will be in <BR>
		training.<BR>
		<BR>
		Also, I am looking for an adult at least 25 years or older to be a &quot;den mom&quot; <BR>
		for the week of July 18 - 24.  I have 4 teenage girls who have volunteered to <BR>
		work at camp that week.  I would like a responsible adult to stay in Craig's <BR>
		Cabin with them, just to keep a concerned and watchful eye on them.  This <BR>
		person can volunteer to work odd jobs or can relax all day and night.  The <BR>
		point is to have an adult present in the Cabin for safe keeping of our young <BR>
		volunteers.  The teens range in age from 15 - 17.  They are unrelated and <BR>
		coming from several different churches.  Sounds like a great job for someone <BR>
		looking to read a few good books and get away from the city.<BR>
		<BR>
		Please contact me by email or call me at 909-794-2928.  Because UU youth camp <BR>
		is in session during most weeks in July, volunteers will be asked to fill out <BR>
		a volunteer application and references will be checked.  Thank you for your <BR>
		consideration of this opportunity.  de Benneville Pines was built by <BR>
		volunteers--you are its soul!<BR>
		<BR>

		Manager  </P>
