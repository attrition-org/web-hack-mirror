~Edgar Allen Poe~<p>

In the greenest of our valleys<br>
By good angels tenanted,<br>
Once a fair and stately palace-<br>
Radiant palace- reared its head.<br>
In the monarch Thought's dominion-<br>
It stood there!<br>
Never seraph spread a pinion<br>
Over fabric half so fair! <br>
<p>
Banners yellow, glorious, golden,<br>
On its roof did float and flow,<br>
(This- all this- was in the olden<br>
Time long ago,)<br>
And every gentle air that dallied,<br>
In that sweet day,<br>
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,<br>
A winged odor went away. <br>
<p>
Wanderers in that happy valley,<br>
Through two luminous windows, saw<br>
Spirits moving musically,<br>
To a lute's well-tuned law,<br>
Round about a throne where, sitting<br>
(Porphyrogene!)<br>
In state his glory well-befitting,<br>
The ruler of the realm was seen. <br>
<p>
And all with pearl and ruby glowing<br>
Was the fair palace door,<br>
Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,<br>
And sparkling evermore,<br>
A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty<br>
Was but to sing,<br>
In voices of surpassing beauty,<br>
The wit and wisdom of their king. <br>
<p>
But evil things, in robes of sorrow,<br>
Assailed the monarch's high estate.<br>
(Ah, let us mourn!- for never morrow<br>
Shall dawn upon him desolate!)<br>
And round about his home the glory<br>
That blushed and bloomed,<br>
Is but a dim-remembered story<br>
Of the old time entombed. <br>
<p>
And travellers, now, within that valley,<br>
Through the red-litten windows see<br>
Vast forms, that move fantastically<br>
To a discordant melody,<br>
While, like a ghastly rapid river,<br>
Through the pale door<br>
A hideous throng rush out forever<br>
And laugh- but smile no more. <br>
