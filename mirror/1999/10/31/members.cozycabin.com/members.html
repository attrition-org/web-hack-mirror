Welcome Members!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://members.CozyCabin.com/cgi-bin/manager.cgi">Log-in</a></font></font></b></center>
Here we hope to provide you with the latest info on your site and provide
you with the resources to help make your web presence a successful one!
These will consist of items from site development to site promotion and
the tools to help you succeed ( hopefully)! We have gained a vast amount
of knowledge ( mostly from experience - not all good) and will attempt
to help by sharing what we have learned - as time allows and new lessons
are learned.
<br>&nbsp;They may even bridge into cgi and other forms of "interactive"
development - only time and your interests will tell. OK, plus how much
sleep I must actually get in order to exist in some type of living form
that doesn't involve life support!&nbsp;
<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font size=+1><font color="#3333FF">Current "Thangs"
</font><font color="#000000">Updated - 3/08/99</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;Oh well, the engine bombed ... was a freebie test thing that
seemed to go awry too often. I've been developing a new engine for <b><a href="http://www.CozyCabin.com/">The
Cozy Cabin</a></b> ..... It is still behind closed doors but looking good!
Once it is up, I'll try to get it cloned and configured for the Members
site shortly thereafter - and incorporate it into the main site.
<br><b>To do</b>: With the new engine, looks as if another server will
be inevitable. so a change is probably going to occur this month - nothing
like more power and speed! Hopefully, I can then get back into providing
a few more "gizmos" for you folks .... the mind is always a wandering off
into the "what about".... I won't mention much now as I might run into
yet another month of programming but.... hang on, neat things a coming!

<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+1>So It Begins....</font></font></b>
<br>To start off, I decided to start with a few "tips" on site development
- mostly influenced by the number of "bad" links on member sites. As I
have the "eyes" of a robot/ spider, I get a rare view as to what is "visible"
to the world. Please do not overlook the basics of having an effective
site - yes, even mirror sites! You gain <b><font color="#00CC00">NOTHING</font></b>
by having visitors if their visits are rendered useless by your "bad" links.
So.... let's start <b><a href="http://members.CozyCabin.com/tips.html">HERE</a></b>!
Let's get things in order!
<br><b><font color="#FF6666">&nbsp;OK!</font></b> After several requests,
I wrote a basic <b><a href="http://members.CozyCabin.com/page_creator.html" target="new">HTML
Page Creation tool</a></b>! It generates the basic html - including the
keywords and description meta tags. The generator will open up in a new
browser window to make it easier to copy and paste the code into your site.
For adding code for images, generate that code <b><a href="http://www.cozycabin.com/metatags.html" target="new">HERE</a></b>
and insert where you want the image to appear in your page.
