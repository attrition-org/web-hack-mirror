    Dan Gough for clubber.co.uk</font><p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Take 1500 gorgeous boys and girls, mix in several top international DJ’s playing some absolutely blinding tunes in two main arenas, add a great décor, sound system and several fit dancers heat for six hours, and your results is one of the best nights in Birmingham. No need to add atmosphere, as there is already huge amounts flowing through the clubbers. Someone could make a lot of money bottling and sell this stuff! <p> With a line up of Paul Oakenfold, Paul Van Dyk, Seb Fontaine, John Kelly, Boy George, Emma Frisco, A.J. Gibson and Daniel Soto I was already expecting it to be an amazing night. We arrived at 10 o’clock to be met by two massive queues either side of the entrance to the Sanctuary, Digbeth High St. Once inside it was straight into the main room where it was heaving with clubbers. <p> The dance floor was packed already with every bit of available floor was being danced on. We made our way up to the balcony where again it was packed with sweaty clubbers, but this didn’t seem to bother them. As I made my way round to the right hand side the atmosphere hit as John Kelly was pumping out banging tunes. Oakenfold came on at 2am and an already packed main room seemed to fill up with just as many people again. I had never been privileged enough to hear Paul play before now but it is clear to me now why he is heralded one of the best trance DJs in the world. He just keep taking the crowd higher and higher with one blinding tune after another and when Robert Miles’s Children came on OH MY GOD’S Kitchen!! <p> The people I met were all very very friendly and there was no hostility from any one there. The door staff were more than amenable and were up for cracking a few jokes which I think also added to the overall feeling and atmosphere in the place. The women were gorgeous and the lads were all worth one. It was hard to try and distinguish who was a paid dancer for The Kitchen and who was just a clubber. This was one of the best nights I have had out in a very long time. The only bad thing I have to say about the night is, ummmm, absolutely nothing.</font></p>
