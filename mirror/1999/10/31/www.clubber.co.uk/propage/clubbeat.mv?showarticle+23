As everyone battles with the cost of the millennium meltdown, Bakers are offering a hassle free, all-inclusive evening in the company of Birmingham’s top resident DJs ANDY CLEETON and JOHN HOLLIS, who will be joined by XTRAVAGANZA’s own ALEX GOLD and ROBBIE NELSON (of ‘AGNELLI & NELSON’ who scored huge hits with the anthems “El Nino” and “Everyday”). Bakers are offering you the chance to see the dawning of the next millennium, in plush surroundings where the eminent venue will be wall to wall with glamorous girls and well groomed guys. The ‘piece de resistance’ is by far the FREE BAR from 9pm - 6am, where you’ll be able to celebrate to your heart’s content, without worrying whether you’ve got enough money left. You don’t even need concern yourself with the headache of getting a taxi - the club will even sort that out for you! Those generous Bakers people will also be throwing in free entrance on Christmas Eve for those that have bought Millennium tickets. This price also includes a unique Republica Millennium Souvenir Pack and entry into the LABATT’S ICE prize draw - with the chance to win a 2 week, all inclusive VIP trip to IBIZA. So if you haven’t organised your millennium yet, let BAKERS do it for you. Arrange your New Year and Christmas in one phonecall and secure your place at the most revered venue in Birmingham as the countdown begins. It’s your last night of the year, the century and the millennium - what better reason to treat yourself with the ultimate hassle-free party?</font></p>
