    Richard Isaacs for clubber.co.uk</font><p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Undeniably over the past year, one man has become synonymous with the emerging and ever evolving sound which has taken over from house as the music of modern British dance floors. The music which I refer to is of course trance and the man to whom I refer is of course Paul van Dyk. Totting up a hugely popular hit with his For An Angel track and producing numerous remixes for B.T, Tilt, along with many others Paul van Dyk can probably be cited as the most recent master of European techno trance. His name is listed along with the other great names of the genre such as Sasha, Oakenfold, Digweed etc. it is undeniable that he is now recognized as one of the greats. <p>It only makes sense that such a reputed DJ should take up a regular listings place with a club of equal reputation in his style of music. The club would have to be therefore the mighty Gatecrasher (recent master of Northern clubbing). Gatecrasher can probably personally be held responsible for Van Dyk’s regular appearances here in Britain because as he has said himself before, he loves the club and finds it a personal pleasure to play there, so the 2nd of October had a very special treat in store for all true trance heads. Paul van Dyk live at Gatecrasher for a six hour set. Ahhhhh bliss indeed. Arriving about 9.30 the queue was as always, ridiculously long. Hordes of spiky haired, glow stick wielding, crasher kids all dressed up in fluorescent clothing and  donning painted faces anxious to get in and begin the madness. <p>Gatecrasher for those who have never visited is a very industrial looking club with lots of angular walling and metal walkways. The redecoration completed at the start of the year went some way to softening the appearance inside but on the whole the club continues to posses a hard edge which complements the music that it smashes out there every week. <p>On entry to the club Jamie Lewis was playing some cool original grooves including The Jackson’s and Candi Staton in the smaller plasma lounge. Meanwhile in the Future (main) room Ashley Cassel was warming up the slowly entering crowd with some deep house and rough beats, a very different flavour to what was to come later. <p>As the queues outside continued to shrink slowly the hour approached 12 and Paul van Dyk made a swift entrance to take his place at the helm to lead his adoring crasher kids on a 6 hour expedition of euphoric beats and breakdowns. Their pied piper had arrived and none could resist. <p>The lighting was purposefully dim, no huge strobes were used, just darkness which was effectively pierced by sudden bursts of green laser shot spreading out over the frantic crowd delighting below. Faces weren’t clear due to the smokiness of the main room but you instinctively knew there was a beaming smile over everyone’s painted face. Paul van Dyk was playing a set of the purest hard trance possible. His mixing was impeccable -  utterly faultless. The tracks he chose were spine tinglingly electric and you could literally touch the atmosphere in the air. None were still and all were left breathless. Making my way on tour around the club there was a definite energy in Crasher that I don’t think I’ve ever felt there before. The back area was filled with people dancing, talking and enjoying themselves. There was a true feeling of being amongst friends even though I knew only a few when I went in, I knew many more when I came to leave much later. <p> His set continued to grow and evolve throughout the night. Most of the tracks were unheard of but none the less brilliant in their capacity to raise the revelers to an even higher level. I didn’t look at my watch because I didn’t want the night to end. Six hours just wouldn’t be enough. Cameras flashed away as people aimed and hoped they’d come out with a momento of this special night, a little more than just memories if possible a picture of the master at work. The lasers continued to swing to and from, people hugged people they’d never spoken to before and Paul van Dyk smiled as he watched it all unfold below him. All too soon though 6am arrived and his set reached a momentous conclusion finishing in a melodic tune to soften the blow of it all ending. The lights went on and everyone simply stood and clapped and yelled and prayed for an encore. His answer could be only one thing, For an Angel was blasted out through out the club to a rapturous reception. This he followed with his remix of Binary Finary’s 1998 and it was all rounded off finally with Quench’s Dreams. WOW. <p>This much fun can’t be legal can it? <p>Very special thanks to: Louise Kovaks and all the staff at Gatecrasher. Alistair and all at clubber (because we’re the best and the others know it). To my friends Tony and Alex (and all his crew especially those that helped me through my cramp). Finally hello to Wayne the cat in the top hat.</font></p>
