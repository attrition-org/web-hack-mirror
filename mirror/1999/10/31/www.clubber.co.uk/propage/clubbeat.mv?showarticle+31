    Alistair Owen Thomas for clubber.co.uk</font><p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">After moving fom Birmingham to various other venues throughout the West Midlands Miss Moneypennys moves back to what has been quoted as being ' Monepennys spiritual home'. <p> One of Clubber's elite spies heard the following conversation between Bonds and a certain Miss Moneypenny - Bonds " Its been a while Moneypenny ". Miss Moneypenny " You could say that. What took you ?". Bonds " I fell out of the air without a parachute, fighting world domination, the usual - the same old dream. This industry is an asylum - full of people who think they're Napoleon. Or God ". Miss Moneypenny " I hope you haven't come to rescue me - I don't like to disappoint ". Bonds " They told me you had been assasinated - rumour had it you were dragged hostage round all the venues in the West Midlands " . Miss Moneypenny " Yes this is my second life ". Bonds " You only live twice Moneypenny? I have come to ask for your return - without you we fear for the entertainment of the civilised world ". Miss Moneypenny " Never again " . Bonds " Never? ". <p> Due to the delicate nature of the matter at hand, Clubber is not at liberty to confirm when or where this conversation was overheard. If anyone asks you where you sourced your information, due to the data protection act ( 1984 ), you will be unable to disclose this as well. All that is left to say is, 16/10/99 - B.O.N.D.S -  W.E.L.C.O.M.E. - H.O.M.E.</font></p>
