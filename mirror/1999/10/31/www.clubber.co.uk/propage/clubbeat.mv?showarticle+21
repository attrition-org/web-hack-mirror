    Laurence Gunn for clubber.co.uk</font><p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">It was sensationally announced on the 28th September that the opening of the latest London superclub, Fabric, has been delayed due to technical difficulties.  The three floor monster, in  competition with Home, Leicester Square, has let it be known that the management of the club were unhappy with the finishing of the interior and so have put back the grand opening (and you'd better beklieve we're going to be there) to the rather surprising date of Thursday 28th October. <p> We'll give you more information as we find it. ALSO get ready for the lowdown on the club when we release our definitive guide in the next few weeks. Rest assured, with Grooverider and Sasha as residents, this place is going to provide some stiff competition for Home. Who'll be the winner? Who'll be nursing bruises? One thing is for certain, it can only be good news for clubbers in the UK to see that so much is being put into an ever growing scene. <P> See you at the opening.</font></p>
