      for clubber.co.uk</font><p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The king of clubland, CHARLIE CHESTER, looks set to whip up a feverish frenzy in the heart of the country with his New Year Mezzanine extravaganza. Held in conjunction with the MINISTRY OF SOUND, the man with the masterplan will be launching the Mezzanine into the next millennium, with an explosive exhibition of international and home-grown deck flair. The celebrated venue will stage the Midlands’ most extravagant and lavish millennium party, with over £10,000 being spent on production and decor including the addition of two 15 x 15 ft screens and a further 15 plasma screens - for an all round audio-visual experience. <p> The showdown kicks off in the Main Room with America's finest rolling into Wolverhampton in the form of SATOSHI TOMIIE, laying down that vital vinyl for an eclectic mix of the best U.S. grooves in an unprecedented UK set. On loan from the MoS, the Midlands welcome the esteemed CJ MACINTOSH who’ll be churning out his fusion of chunky tunes, before being joined by the intellectual sound of the local hero KIDDO. <p> Live ISDN link ups mean it will be a true legend of the turntables that welcomes the new era -the one and only American dream DAVID MORALES. Crossing between the ones and the twos, MORALES will see in the new millennium in from the Ministry in London. A further live link up means Mezzanine's faithful will get the unique chance to see (and hear) the new millennium celebrations twice, in the capable hands of a VERY SPECIAL SURPRISE GUEST - live from NEW YORK! <p> Over in the Red Zone, it’s party-party all the way as one of the true hedonists in global clubbing touches down to show everybody how it should be done - the legendary ALEX P. Who else would you rather have in tow when it comes to celebrating in style? If that wasn’t enough, one of the true success stories of 1999, GUY ORNADEL (to be confirmed), will be topping his quite magnificent year off at the Mezzanine, after being joined by wonderboys MATT CASSAR and DAVE LEE. <p> Finally, over in the Blue Zone, another mainstay of the UK scene in the shape of TERRY FARLEY will be leading a merry dance, ably assisted by the consistently refreshing, sublimely skilled JO MILLS. <p> Generous as ever, Chester and the gang are cutting the cost of clubbing on the ultimate party night ever by offerring tickets for this unique event at an amazing £69. If that wasn’t enough, the first 300 people to purchase will get theirs at an astonishing £39, with the next 350 only having to part with £49! Once your ticket is purchased you will receive a limited edition Mezzanine bag and an exclusive CD-ROM that will feature news, music, features and footage from both the Mezzanine and Ministry. Then roll on New Years Eve, bag on shoulder, head down to Mezzanine and enjoy the spectacle that awaits you.</font></p>
