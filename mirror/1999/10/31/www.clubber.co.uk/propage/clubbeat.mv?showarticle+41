    Alistair Owen Thomas for clubber.co.uk</font><p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">When Miss Moneypenny notified the clubbing nation that she was returning to Bonds', the response was a feeling of she was returning home. After taking up residency in Wolverhampton, at the Canal Club, and then moving back to do Cosmic Candystore at a venue with more AKAs than Prince (oops can I actually call him that?), the return to Bonds was the buzz word in Birmingham. The Ryan's who have personally built the successful night after doing Chuff Chuff for 14 years were united in the fact that Moneypennys is as much a part of Bonds' as Bonds' is a part of Moneypennys. After receiving this information we would have been fools not to go up and check the night out for ourselves.<p> I never went to Moneypennys at Bonds, thus for me it was an entirely new experience, an experience, may I add, that I was truly looking forward to.<p> After checking in to the hotel we were straight off to see what Bonds was about. Bonds was surrounded by huge amounts of people, eagerly awaiting their moment to step inside. I can quite honestly say that the response to Moneypennys' return could be felt as soon as we stepped out of the cab. There was a feeling of excitement in the air and due to this I knew instantly that all was going to be good. The first thing that  became apparent was the number of faces I recognised from the Canal club and more predominantly El Divinos.<p> In true Moneypennys' style we were greeted by friendly door staff who ushered us through to a lavishly decorated room that was complemented perfectly by the music that was coming from within.<p> It may be just a personal feeling, but there is nothing quite like Moneypennys. It's tangible to a certain extent but there is that 'thing' that words fail to describe. I think a great deal of this is due to the fact that the hosts spend the night in the club as well. You can always see Lee Garrick or one of the Ryan brothers talking, to, and greeting people around the club. It makes the night feel a bit more personal, you get the feeling that you are in a very exclusive private party.<p> I'd say that the music plays a big part in the experience as well and  the selection that night was a melifluous blend of US house, funk and basically anything with a smooth flavour. I took a wander around and found a funky little room upstairs that was right on it, then walked further and heard the genius of the Blue Light Collective. Upstairs had a very smooth tip, people were chatting and after talking to a few of them my suspicions were confirmed: everyone was glad that Miss Moneypennys had returned to Bonds.<p> It may appear that there is no mention of the DJs, but I had to primarily let you know that Moneypennys is a night based primarily around atmosphere. The DJs are important (of course) because they are the ones who provide the tick to the clock that is Moneypennys, and this is what I am trying to get at ultimately - Moneypennys is made up of more than just one component. These components are what make the night work and thus is created a night like none other. The musical perfection is summed up more by the creation of a vibe or feeling evoked by a set, rather than saying so and so played this tune that was wicked. At this point it must be said that both Jim 'Shaft' Ryan & Danny Rampling played sets that were fantastic.<p> I must stress this point: IF YOU WEREN'T AT THE RELAUNCH AT BONDS' ON THE OPENING NIGHT, I SUGGEST YOU GO THERE A.S.A.P.<p> Bonds is the perfect venue for Moneypennys and I hope this explaination has done the night justice. All I can do to sum up is say in Mike Ryan's own words "It's good to be home."<p> Thanks must go to: Lee Garrick, Mike,Dermot and Jim Ryan, Niki, Gary, Jo at EML, Julie and all the bar staff for being friendly.<p> FOR INTERNET EYES ONLY.<p> If you are one of those 1400 people who had to be turned away from Miss Moneypenny's incredibly successful return to Bond's, don't panic - because you too can feast your eyes and ears on Birmingham's best.<p> Video footage of the evening's highlights will be available on the Miss Moneypenny's website: www.moneypennys.com so you too can see the spectacular decor and flamboyant entertainment.<p> See the two Statuesque bodybuilders, six outrageously clad dancers, three boisterous transvestites and a percussion team.<p>Hear Danny Rampling's excellent set and take a virtual stroll through the House, Rare Groove and 'Bleu Light collective' rooms that delighted revellers of all tastes.<p> Fell the amazing atmosphere that confirmed that Miss Moneypenny's is back with a vengence and Birmingham is happy to see her home.
