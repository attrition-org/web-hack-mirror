      for clubber.co.uk</font><p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">After the gold-selling success of the “DAVE PEARCE Presents. ” album, Dave’s hugely popular ‘Dance Anthems’ radio show has again been the base for the track selection on this forthcoming album. Since its inception almost two years ago, ‘Dance Anthems’ has quickly become the fastest growing show on Radio 1 and now boasts well in excess of 1.6 million listeners each week. Running every Sunday from 7pm-10pm, all the tracks on “DAVE PEARCE Presents.2” have been amongst the most requested on the show. <p> Bursting at the seams with some of clubland’s biggest hits, the synth riffs, energy and breakdowns erupt from the speakers throughout the album’s massive 40-track length. With a quality control that states ‘only the biggest anthems from today’s dancefloors and the most sought after classics from yesteryear’, “DAVE PEARCE Presents.2” features many of the most popular tracks from Pearce’s summer residency at EDEN in IBIZA. From the spine-tingling trance sounds of Planet Perfecto’s “Not Over Yet” and Paul van Dyk’s “Avenue”, to the sun-kissed vibes of Moloko’s “Sing It Back”, Paul Johnson’s “Get Get Down” and Bob Marley’s “Sun Is Shining”, the album contains everything you need to cling onto those fading summer memories. “DAVE PEARCE Presents.2” not only sparkles with current anthems from York and Fragma, but also with classic tracks from the likes of Lil Louis with the sexually charged “French Kiss”, the all-time great “Let Me Show You” from K-Klass and a flashback to the rave days with SL2’s “DJs Take Control”. As an additional bonus, Pearce has carefully selected a number of mouth-watering new tracks from his own record box including Hi-Gate’s pumping “Pitchin” and “Apache” from Starfighter - both of which are destined to become future anthems in their own right. <p> Commenting on the release, Dave Pearce said: “Because the album is based on the most popular requests from my ‘Dance Anthems’ show, clubbers know that every track on the album is a tried and tested winner - there are no fillers!” <p> DAVE PEARCE ON RADIO 1FM  6-8PM EACH WEEKDAY /“DANCE ANTHEMS” - SUNDAY 7-10PM <p> “DAVE PEARCE Presents.2” Release Date: 11th October 1999 - Manifesto Records</font></p>
