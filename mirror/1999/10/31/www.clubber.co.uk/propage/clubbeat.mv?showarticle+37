    Laurence Gunn for clubber.co.uk</font><p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">If you've never heard of the Southport Weekender, here's a brief guide as to what to expect from one of the UK's premier weekend benders. Kiss goodbye to all of your problems, don your most sweat resistant clothes and prepare for the mayhem you know you deserve in four purpose-built indoor venues<p> These past twelve years of hugely large weekends have produced a list of DJ's and artists that have played to make even the most seasoned of booking agents blush. Apearances at this event have been made by such varied talents as Paul Oakenfold, LTJ Bukem, David Morales, Soul II Soul, Duane Harden, Ultra Nate and A Tribe Called Quest to name but just a few, and the high quality of the music seems to be just as sorted this time around. Spread over four rooms at the Pontin's Holiday Centre in Ainsdale, near Southport, you can expect to be battered by the pumping tunes of Erick Morillo, Roger Sanchez and Danny Rampling in The Powerhouse, or alterantively you could try something a bit more chilled with Gilles Peterson and Norman Jay in The Alterantive Arena which will blend an oh so smooth mix of Jazz, Funk, Drum 'n' Bass and Big Beat. Still not convinced? How about Trevor Nelson and DJ Swing in The Funkbase laying down some of the most super heavy R&B, Soul, Hip-Hop and old school classics. Last and by no means least, you can never have an event like this without some tribute paid to the music that started all of these genres - soul. Just for this purpose you can slide on down to The Connoisseurs Corner where the tracks will flow from those that know in the form of Richard Searling, Bob Jones and the man Norman Jay again. What you see here could be made into one fabulous night over these four rooms, but the line up that I have seen really should be made illegal because there's far too much pleasure involved over what is a massive three days.<p> The Weekender crew have taken over at the Pontins venue, with accomodation being based around 1000 self-catering apartments on-site. To each of these rooms you will find a dedicated TV channel for the weekend and London's Active FM providing an on site radio service that will also be transmitted back to East London and Essex so your mates won't miss out either (providing, of course, your mates live in either East London or Essex).<p> Danny Rampling probably put it best about this superb event when he said of the Weekender: "The best gathering of people who love and adore soulful music. Always has a consistent strong line up of quality DJ's." The weekend is renowned for its spirit of the old school, providing people with an opportunity to relive those hazy days of '88, and with that kind of reputation it's simple really: Make sure you are there at all costs.<p><p> The Southport Weekender weighs in at a modest £90.00 per person and includes accomodation for two nights and three days in fully equipped self-catering apartments, use of all the on-site facilities and entrance to all the dance arenas and live performances.<p> For all enquiries, please call 01207 549 223 or have a look at their website: www.southportweekender.co.uk. If you want tickets you'd better get a move on because a quarter of the places have already gone and this event promises to be the fastest selling yet.<p> Clubber wishes all of the Weekender crew the very best of luck and hope that their event will go off in the largest styleeeee possible. Nice ones all round.</font></p>
