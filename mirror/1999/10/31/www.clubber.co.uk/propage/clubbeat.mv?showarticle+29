    Richard Isaacs for clubber.co.uk</font><p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">As I sit here at my lap top, ever so slightly cross eyed, listening to the sounds of Sasha play on my stereo, I try to think and put into words the very special event which took place last night at a little known club called Cream somewhere in Liverpool. Yes the mighty Cream was celebrating it’s 7th birthday as a continuing leader in the art of clubbing and this was to be no slap-dash affair either. A no holds barred celebration of what has to be one of Britain’s best loved nights. The line up simply spoke for itself with an endless stream of big name DJs being put on for their fans delight - Sasha, Jules, Seb Fontaine (BIG BLOKE), Digweed, John Kelly, Nick Warren and the list just goes on and on plus a very special guest (all will be revealed later).<p> This was a dream come true, nearly all of my favourite spinners all playing under one roof at what is probably my favourite club, however, a small question remained in many peoples minds as to weather it could live up to previous years without the appearance of a certain Mr. Oakenfold. Any doubters though were rapidly silenced for this was not to be a disappointing night by any stretch of the imagination. We began our night in the ever popular courtyard - the crowd was heaving, the air was full of excitement and the courtyard was rocking as we entered. John Kelly was busy straining to see the title of his current vinyl, while Cream’s excellent lighting moved graphic images of CREAM’S 7TH BIRTHDAY across the screens either side of the DJ booth. Moving clouds of cream frothed, boiled and exploded behind the moving words and another ass kicking baseline smashed through the high trebled breakdowns and out over the courtyard. Strobes went on while flashes of green and red lit up the faces of the revelers who were reaching euphoric states. <p> A lesser known Heman Cattaneo took over from John Kelly and was quick to get in on the action, belting out many of the current favourites which despite being popular remain unusually rare with nobody ever knowing the names of them (annoying that isn’t it.) The crowd didn’t let up at all and were enjoying every second of the man's imaginative set. About 12.30 we left the courtyard to check out the rest of the talent currently on offer. In the tiny Annex area usually devoted to something a little more sedated, there was a coup afoot to turn this little place right on it’s head. Lined up in there were three of the biggest of the big. With three hour sets by each of John Digweed, Nick Warren and Sasha, I drooled at the prospect of what was in store for us. When we entered the Annex at 12.30 Digweed was in the midst of a set of his elegant deep trance. The crowd were genuinely enjoying this rather more laid back approach to dance music and it was warming them up beautifully for what was to happen there later. Yearning for something with a little more kick behind i,t we headed into the main area somewhere in the hour of 1 to check out precisely who the special guest star was. The man of the night could only have been the man of the year so to see a certain Mr. Cook doing his stuff for the punters made this a very special night. Yes the special guest was no less than Fat boy Slim himself trashing the place with his personal style of kick ass break beat, hard edged dance and a smattering of trance this was no let down and worked wonderfully well with the pattern of the night. We soon faced a very hard decision though the Annex for Nick Warren or main room for the resident Seb Fontaine. We decided to nip between both every so often and occasionally take in 20 minutes of Judge Jules who was going off in the Courtyard. All were as to be expected - quite awe inspiring. Julesy was playing back to back with his own ego but none the less was constantly brilliant. During his set he took five minutes to chat with Fat boy Slim before putting on another pumping trancer. We shortly made our way through the main area to take in Seb as he mashed up the place with tunes as big as himself. <p> Finally, the night had to be ended in the little Annexe, a room which I think may be undeserving of the talent within. We caught the last hour of Nick Warren's amazing set full of the latest heart pounding techno trance. The crowd now though were becoming very restless in anticipation of the man claimed to be the son of God SASHA. I truly believe that the whole of Cream pushed into this tiny room to hear him play. Arriving at 3.20 Sasha pushed his way through his adoring fans towards the small DJ box. Looking a little the worse for wear he begun to wind up the crowd. The room filled with the most beautiful sounds imaginable; swirls of tranced out beats enveloped the people and the place. All were within his grasp and he knew exactly where to take them. Sasha's sets are distinctive and musical, enjoyable and soulful and satisfaction comes as standard because he appears to enjoy performing as much as people love to hear him play. The room was hot and sticky and beads of sweat began to fall from the ceiling as it rained inside yet nobody noticed nor did they care; everyone was a million miles away from a sweaty dark room in Liverpool - they were somewhere out there on planet Sasha. On and on he played, seamlessly mixing breathtaking tracks left everybody with nowhere to hide but within themselves. For that night alone the Annexe became the Courtyard and those that didn’t leave Cream a slightly different person when it was all over and the lights went on must have been asleep somewhere. <p> A VERY VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO CREAM, ALL THE STAFF AND ESPECIALLY ALL THE SPECIAL PEOPLE THAT MAKE IT WHAT IT IS. <p> A special thank you to Gill and all the staff at Cream that made all this possible. All the raving nutters and friendly clubbers, the DJs (especially my man Seb) and all of my friends at Cream and Gatecrasher. To Alex and the Beast (who gets us there every time) and my special Crasher kids Haley and Jodie (and all their friends). Not forgetting my man Alistair (it’s all squared) and all at Clubber. Just wish I had another roll of film.</font></p>
