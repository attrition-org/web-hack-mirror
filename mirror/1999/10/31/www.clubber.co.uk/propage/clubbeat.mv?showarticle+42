    Alistair Owen Thomas for clubber.co.uk</font><p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The two lucky winners have already been informed, we've got our tickets and the other thousands of clubgoers are eagerly awaiting what can only be described as another fantastic weekend. Everything ever written about Slinky describes it as being one of the top nights in the UK and easily  the best club in the South. From the production to the extravagant line-ups, no expense is spared when providing its faithful with the 'Slinky experience'.  Anyone who has previously been to the BIC for one of the balls can only talk about it recalling fantastic memories with a smile on their face.<p> Any events hosted by, or in conjunction with, Slinky are always well worth the visit. The atmospheres electric and the crowd really get into the music. If anyone didn't manage to get tickets for this one, be warned - if you want to go for NYE I suggest you buy your tickets just after you have finished reading this. Well this is all I can tell you about the event until I've been. If you have any queries of how to get to the BIC etc, either call the BIC on (01202) 456456, or drop us an email and we'll see if we can help.</font></p>
