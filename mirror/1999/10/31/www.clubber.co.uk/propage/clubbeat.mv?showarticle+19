    Dan Biggin for clubber.co.uk</font><p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">O.K, O.K, I know how it goes. Your mate comes round and he is the coolest guy in your town. He has the puffiest of puffer jackets, wasting no time in allowing himself total control over your brand new Technics. He empties the many pockets of his fat trousers of tapes and CD's (and your not totally sure where he had room for those slammin' 12"s.) Before you know it he has played you tune after tune that he assures you are the most slamming, fat and wickedest cuts going around. As you stare at his baseball cap, on backwards of course, bobbing in time to some farty bass noises, you can think of only three things: <p> 1) He looks pretty fly for a white guy. <p> 2) I hope that doesn't mean he's blown my speakers - and - <p> 3) I could do better than this. <p> Well, now's your chance. I want you to look in the mirror and yell "I am Spartacus!" O.K, maybe that should be 'I am Norman Cook', but I don't think that is the best name to give yourself is it? Well, whether you decide that you are Spartacus or the allegedly fat, yet strangely slim person is none of my business. However, this is. <p> This is the first of many instalments on setting up at home and recording the next big dancefloor anthems yourself (even if thst dancefloor is your front room hearth rug.) <p> This first piece is aimed mainly at beginners, so, those of you who know what you're doing, pop back in a few weeks and see if the rest of the class have caught up, you prodigious people, you. Stick with it because I'm not being patronising, however the fundamentals do need explaining for some of us who haven't touched this kind of equipment before. <p> THE BASICS - The first thing that you need to get are some sounds to use in your new tunes. There are two main options here: <p> 1) You could opt for a keyboard or a sound module which will contain a large selection of sounds on board at your disposable. The other option is - <p> 2) A sampler. This way, whatever sounds you hear anywhere are yours to use in your tune, whether it's your dog barking or whether it's bits or sounds from other songs. NB: You MUST remember that when sampling the works of other musicians that basic copyright laws do stand, and that infringement on these laws can, and often will, result in long and expensive court cases - even the biggest performers are not above the law. (You need look no further than the seemingly infinite cases involving Hip Hop and Dance DJ's.) <p> The benefits of using a sampler are multitude. Firstly, you aren't limited to the sounds you have in your banks, and secondly, you can build up (on disk) a vast library of samples. Thirdly, fourthly, fifthly, sixthly, seventhly and eighthly, you can sample whole phrases to be looped/repeated and edited as you wish. For example; a whole bass line or drum break can be looped and cut up or filtered/effected to add variety to your tune (more on this in later editions.) In an ideal world you would really have both a keyboard/ sound module and a sampler to combine synth noises and live instrument sounds with other noises and speech or vocals. <p> For the basic examples of what I'm going to show you I will be using a Korg X5DR sound module with MIDI contoller keyboard and an Akai S3000 sampler. (Don't worry about MIDI 'cause I'll explain that next time.) <p> Just for now we'll play with the sounds that we have on the Korg. The reason that I use the Korg is because it has a vast selection of real instrument sounds from pianos to drums to monkey's scrotums (alright, I lied about that bit) and because I write Ambient and Hip Hop and listen to a lot of DJ Shadow, these sounds are best for me. You will also find what suits you best as time goes on and you begin to explore your influences and the sounds in your own head. <p> If you are using a sound module, you need to connect this to a controller keyboard to trigger these sounds. Controller keyboards are dirt cheap now - a good one with touch sensitive keys can be purchased for around £80 if you keep your eyes peeled. Don't worry if you can't hear any sounds because the controller doesn't contain any at all. The sounds of your dreams will come from the module which you can connect to an amplifier easily with the right leads. Once connected, it is best to spend a week or so playing with and familiarising yourself with the sounds that you now have. You will find that when flicking through the banks of sounds your imagination will be sparked and you will get ideas for songs flooding from your ears. Do not forget to mop them up and bottle them for when you are capable of producing them exactly as you want because many people have been reported to have drowned in tunes, never to resurface. Scary. <p>  Next time, we will look at the sampler basics, basic MIDI and getting these sounds together into a sample tune. <p> <p> From the editor: Danny B will soon be taking on board all your problems and easing your pain with a Q&A corner, hidden deep in darkest Colchester.
