<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The Parkinson's Disease Foundation
(PDF) was founded in 1957 to encourag</FONT>e and promote research into
Parkinson's disease, a chronic, degenerative neurological disorder that
exhibits itself in such symptoms as tremor, stiffness and slowness of movement.
Although many strides have been made over the past four decades in the
management of the disease--beginning with the discovery of levodopa in
the 1960s, in which the Foundation played an important role-- its cause
and cure continue to elude us.&nbsp;

<P>The founder was William Black, a New York City businessman. His gift
of $5 million to Columbia University to create a research building--plus
an additional $1 million to create an endowment for the foundation itself--was
at the time the largest gift ever made to Columbia by a living donor. Under
the terms of the deed of gift, the offices and laboratories of the Parkinson's
Disease Foundation are housed rent-free at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center. This subsidy, along with interest on the Foundation's bank accounts,
underwrite most of the Foundation's administrative expenses. This in turn
means that more than 95 cents of each donated dollar goes to the support
of the Foundation's medical research, education and public information
programs.&nbsp;

<P>Today, the Foundation is one of the main forces in America providing
financial support for high-caliber basic research and educational support
for families with Parkinson's and strategic leadership for greater public
recognition of the crucial need to devote intellectual and financial resources
to the solution of this terrible condition that afflicts 500,000 to one
million Americans and more than 10 million other individuals around the
world. Its work is in three main areas, as follows:&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>(1) Leadership in the Present. </FONT></FONT>Support
of the Center for Parkinson's Disease and Other Movement Disorders at the
Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. The center is recognized as one of
the world's leading centers of clinical and basic research into the causes,
management and cure of Parkinson's disease. From the development of Levodopa
in the late 1960s through to studies of the efficacy of neural transplants
in the late 1990s, the center has been involved in virtually every major
development in basic science and drug development in Parkinson's disease
and other movement disorders, including "Parkinson's- Plus" disorders,
dystonia and Huntington's disease.&nbsp;

<P>The center has a core staff of 10 clinician- scientists (all of whom
have MDs with specialty training in neurology and several of whom have
PhDs or extensive experience in the basic sciences); a group of five to
seven post-doctoral fellows from different parts of the United States and
the world, most of whom return to assume leadership positions in their
home towns and countries; four experienced nurse-clinicians, who run the
clinical trials of new medications and other research projects, including
the Foundation's Brain Bank; and a professional staff of laboratory technicians,
genetics counselors and administrative personnel. The Center also has formal
and informal links to surgical and epidemiological research in other parts
of the university system, including the Department of Neurosurgery and
the Gertrude H. Sergievsky Center, which sponsors studies of epidemiologic
approaches to the study of neurodevelopmental disorders.&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>(2) Leadership for the Future.</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=+2>
</FONT></I></FONT>Preparing Tomorrow's Leaders through a National Program
of Research Grants and Postdoctoral Fellowships. In addition to its direct
support of one of the world's leading centers of Parkinson's science, the
PDF contributes to the wider field of Parkinson's research through two
highly competitive and scientifically-refereed awards programs. One of
these is of research grants to institutions; the other, of fellowships
to young scientists.&nbsp;

<P>Since the Foundation's inception four decades ago, this role has been
central to its mission. At no time was this more evident than in November
of 1996, with the announcement, in an article appearing in the journal
Science, of the discovery of a gene for Parkinson's disease. Thirty-five
years earlier, Dr. Roger DuVoisin, then a promising young scientist and
today the senior member of the team of authors for the Sciencearticle,
assumed his position as the PDF's first postdoctoral Research Fellow. This
year, the Foundation accepted applications for the research grants program
from 24 institutions in 15 states and provinces throughout the United States
and Canada. From this list, five were selected competitively by a committee
of senior scientists from Columbia to receive research grants of up to
$35,000 a year.&nbsp;

<P>The committee's main criteria were scientific excellence and the potential
for significantly expanding our knowledge about Parkinson's in important
and practical ways. Each of the projects selected shows the potential not
only for enhancing the science of Parkinson's but also for leading into
a proposal for longer-term and larger support from the National Institutes
of Health (NIH), the premier source of research funding in America. The
other prong in the Foundation's program to nurture and support young scientists
is the postdoctoral fellowship program. Last year, the Foundation supported
eight such awards. The young doctors receive a modest stipend and some
of the best and most comprehensive training in movement disorders available
in the world.&nbsp;

<P>One measure of the success of this program is where the fellows go afterwards.
At this writing, almost every major movement disorders center in the New
York metropolitan area--Mount Sinai Medical Centers, Beth Israel Medical
Center, North Shore Hospital and others--is headed by a graduate of this
program. A companion to the postdoctoral fellows program is the Foundation's
nationwide program of summer fellowships. Last year, the Foundation sponsored
12 such awards at as many institutions, including Brown University (Providence,
RI); Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center and the University of
Chicago (Chicago, IL); Ohio State University; Harvard University (Cambridge,
MA); University of Miami (Miami, FL); University of California (Irvine,
CA); University of Virginia (Charlottesville, VA); Yale University (New
Haven, CT); the University of Rochester (Rochester, NY); Vanderbilt University
(Nashville, TN); and the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI).&nbsp;

<P>Many of the PDF's contributions in this area over the years have been
in behalf of leading institutions abroad. Among the foreign institutions
which have sent fellows to Columbia over the years have been the Tianjin
School of Medicine (China); Hadassah Medical Center (Israel); University
of London (U.K.); University of Warsaw (Poland); University of Ottawa (Canada);
University of Madrid (Spain); University of Milano (Italy); Yamagata University
(Japan); University of Beograd (Croatia); University of Brussels (Belgium);
University of Bangalore (India)); Agios Oavlos Hospital (Greece); Haciteppe
University (Turkey); and Hospital de Especialidades (Mexico).&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>(3) Leadership in the Community.</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=+2>
</FONT></I></FONT>Informing People with Parkinson's and their Families;
Educating the Public and the Professions; Advocating for the Cause The
PDF's long-term goal may be the support of Parkinson's research but its
day-to-day mailbag and fax and telephone traffic is filled with calls for
help from patients and Parkinson's families around the country. More than
25 calls on average come in every business day over our toll-free telephone
lines from patients and their families--most typically, people who have
been recently diagnosed with Parkinson's and who are crying out for help:
information about the disease, referrals to physicians and assistance with
questions such as where to find social services, where to get health, life
and long-term-care insurance and how to combat job discrimination.&nbsp;

<P>The Foundation takes this part of its mission very seriously, through
publications, professional education, public advocacy and -- to the extent
time and professional resources permit -- personal consultation. Our regular
educational activities include:&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>A quarterly newsletter</FONT></FONT>,
covering everything from medical news to support group successes to fundraising
activities. The content is varied but rooted in a single theme: what do
people with Parkinson's disease, and their families, want--and need--to
know? We tell them of the medications just released (and those still in
the pipeline); of the activities of the established support groups (and
those that are just forming); of the scientific achievements of the mature
scientists (and the younger ones coming along); of the few leadership gifts
(and the many, equally appreciated, smaller ones). We share tips from people
who have struggled with, and mastered, life with Parkinson's. We answer
questions from those who feel anxious and needing information. Above all,
we try to convey two simple messages: you, the individual or family who
has been diagnosed with Parkinson's, are not alone ... and your condition
is not a sentence of death, but a redefinition of life. To order the latest edition of the newsletter, <a href="./publicat.htm">click here</a>.</LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>Publications and audiovisual materials</FONT></FONT>,
including descriptions of the medical aspects of the condition; tips and
hints on how to handle it in the home and in the workplace; programs of
exercise and nutrition; and a series of fact sheets on specific aspects
of the disease and its management. - a physician referral service. The
difficulty of diagnosis in Parkinson's disease makes it especially important
for patients and their families to have access to physicians experienced
in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition and other movement disorders.
Few general physicians, and not all neurologists, are fully conversant
with a condition that may constitute less than five percent of their practice.
The role of the PDF here is to maintain files of physicians who are known
to have a special interest and expertise in Parkinson's disease and who
are interested in -- and available for --new patients. Not all scientists,
including some of the most eminent, are available to the average patient.
Our task is to identify those who are ... and to make sure that this list
is available to those who reach out to us for help. To order some of our publications, <a href="./publicat.htm">click here</a>.</LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>In-service training and education for
the professions.</FONT></FONT> Our clinical nurse specialist is available
to meet requests from professional and lay groups--social workers, community
service people, nurses, even physicians--for up-to-date information on
the science and practice of Parkinson's disease management. Last year alone,
we provided more than 25 such sessions, at no charge.</LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>Support for support groups.</FONT></FONT>
The Foundation has corresponding relationships with more than 500 Parkinson's
support groups in more than 40 states. We circulate news and information
and answer queries as needed. We also recognize excellence in performance
by individual support groups through the annual Dorros awards. Named for
Donna and the late Sidney Dorros, legendary leaders in the Parkinson's
support group movement, the program offers two categories of award: one,
for groups run by a health and social services professional and the other,
for groups run entirely by volunteers.</LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>Raising public awareness.</FONT></FONT>
The Foundation has an active media relations program, fielding requests
for information from the mass media and arranging media appearances for
scientists and other experts in Parkinson's disease. Most recently, we
have inaugurated a Parkinson's Science News Bureau, designed to provide
serious medical and science journalists with information and analysis on
such topics as current research, emerging therapies, developments in care-giving
and the demographics, economics and culture of Parkinson's disease and
its management.</LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>Public funding.</FONT></FONT> The role
of the private sector is certainly crucial in raising private monies and
building a national constituency for support of Parkinson's disease research.
In the long term, however, the success of that research will depend upon
sufficient support from public sources, mostly through the National Institutes
of Health. In this connection, the Foundation is an active collaborator
with other organizations in building and sharing the case for increased
federal support. Our main vehicle for this is the Washington (and California)-based
Parkinson's Action Network, which we support financially and in other ways.</LI>
