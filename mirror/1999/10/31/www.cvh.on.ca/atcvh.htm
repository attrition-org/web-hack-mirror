    <h2>Going To The Hospital</h2>
    <p><img align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" hspace="10" SRC="inhosp.gif" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="149"> <ul>
      <li>People in the hospital are there to help you feel better as soon as possible.</li>
      <li>Sometimes your parents can stay overnight with you.</li>
      <li>Bring your favourite things from home. What are some of your favourite things?</li>
      <li>If something hurts or you are scared, let a grown-up know.</li>
      <li>Ask about things that you don't understand. The nurses and doctors are here to help!</li>
      <li>The Credit Valley Hospital has a great playroom with lots of toys, crafts and books. You
        can still have lots of fun when you are in the hospital.</li>
      <li><i>When you get home, you can make a book about your hospital stay. Or how telling your
        friends about your hospital visit.</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Having An X-ray</h2>
    <p><img align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" hspace="10" SRC="x-ray.gif" WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="136"> <ul>
      <li>Doctors and nurses look at X-rays to learn more about your body.</li>
      <li>The X-ray machine is a big camera that takes pictures of the inside of your body.</li>
      <li>The X-ray machine may move and make noise, but it does not touch you.</li>
      <li>The room where the X-ray is done may be dark.</li>
      <li>You need to hold still for your X-ray so the picture is not blurry.</li>
      <li><i>Ask to see your X-ray when it is ready!</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Having A Blood Test</h2>
    <p><img align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" hspace="10" SRC="doctor.gif" WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="101"> <ul>
      <li>The doctor can learn about your blood from a blood test.</li>
      <li>Only a little blood is taken. Your body makes new blood to take the place of the blood
        taken out.</li>
      <li>A blood test is done as quickly as possible</li>
      <li>You can say <i>&quot;Ouch!&quot;</i>, whistle, cry or hold someone's hand.</li>
      <li>You do need to hold still. When you hold still, the test can be done faster.</li>
      <li><i>You can ask for a Band Aid!</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Getting A Shot</h2>
    <p><img align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" hspace="10" SRC="Nurse_.gif" WIDTH="104" HEIGHT="144"> <ul>
      <li>A shot, or a needle, is a way for you to get medicine.</li>
      <li>Shots are done as quickly as possible.</li>
      <li>Ask if you can choose where to have the shot.</li>
      <li>You can say <i>&quot;Ouch!&quot;</i>, whistle, cry or hold someone's hand.</li>
      <li>You do need to hold still. When you hold still, the test can be done faster.</li>
      <li><i>You can ask for a Band Aid!</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Wearing A Cast</h2>
    <p><img align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" hspace="10" SRC="ambulnce.gif" WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="117"> <ul>
      <li>A cast keeps your bones still so they can mend when they are broken.</li>
      <li>When a cast is first put on, it is soft, warm, and wet. It soon gets very hard.</li>
      <li>You can sign your name on your cast. So can your friends and family!</li>
      <li>A cast cutting machine takes your cast off. It is noisy, but it will not touch your
        skin.</li>
      <li><i>Ask if you can keep your cast as a souvenir!</i></li>
    </ul>
