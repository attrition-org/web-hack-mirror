<p align="center"><strong>Should We Be Worried?</strong></p>

<p>The answer in a nutshell is no. For the past year, the technical folks in our
Information Systems Department, as well as our department directors and managers
throughout the hospital, have been testing and reviewing our equipment&#146;s readiness
for the Year 2000 (Y2K). As you probably know already, the Y2K problem resulted from
extensive use of only the last two digits of the calendar year being used in many common
and hospital specific devices. This was an oversight by the computer industry because once
the clock strikes midnight, December 31, 1999, the computers and all of the equipment that
contain date-related computer chips that have not been prepared for the new millennium,
will register as the year 00. That means that those computers &#150; as far as the date
function goes, at least &#150; may not function properly. </p>

<p>That&#146;s why for the past months we&#146;ve been testing all of our hospital
equipment, with a special emphasis put on the equipment used in life-support situations.
For the most part, our equipment is Y2K compatible. In some instances we&#146;ve had to
replace some computer chips in order to make the piece of equipment function. In other
instances we&#146;ve had to replace equipment because there was no way to fix the internal
mechanism in the computer. The Government has been very helpful in providing our hospital,
and all Ontario hospitals, with a special Y2K fund in order to fix or purchase new
equipment. The Credit Valley Hospital received more than $3 million for this purpose. Any
funds not required for Y2K fixes will be returned to the Government. </p>

<p>Although there are still some outstanding issues, and some testing still required, The
Credit Valley Hospital is confident that its critical service equipment (the equipment
used in life-threatening situations) will function. </p>

<p>Some equipment is technically &quot;Y2K ready&quot;, meaning that some minor aspect
such as the date function on a computer print-out may not be working. This may mean our
health care professionals will have to manually record test results. But the equipment
itself will still perform the task that it&#146;s meant for. </p>

<p>Other equipment that we can&#146;t get parts for in time, or that hasn&#146;t been
certified Y2K compliant by an outside supplier, will not be used. In these cases,
department directors have identified alternate ways of achieving the same results for
patients.</p>

<p>Of course there could be circumstances beyond our control, such as electrical supply
failures. Hospitals traditionally have back-up sources of power just for such emergencies.
We have contingency plans in place for &quot;worst case scenarios&quot;. Remember we deal
with emergencies on a daily basis, so although Y2K is a concern, we want to assure our
patients and their families, that we are as prepared as we possibly can be. </p>

<p>We&#146;ve prepared some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) that may address your
concerns. If you have other questions or concerns, please give our Community Relations
Department a call at 813-2617. We&#146;ll also be adding more Y2K Readiness information to
our website as it becomes available. Our internet address is www.cvh.on.ca. </p>

<p>There aren&#146;t any guarantees, but we&#146;re doing our best to beat the Y2K problem
at The Credit Valley Hospital.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions About Y2K and The Credit Valley
Hospital</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q: What does Y2K compliant mean?</strong></p>

<p>A: It means that the micro chips and all date-related functions in the computer or
piece of equipment will function normally when, for example, the calendar year changes
from 1999 to 2000. In order to qualify to be Y2K compliant, each piece of equipment must
pass a series of eleven tests. A piece of equipment is not Y2K compliant when it cannot be
fixed.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What does Y2K ready mean?</strong></p>

<p>A: It means that the computer or equipment with date-related micro chips inside has
been tested and/or fixed so that it will function normally when the calendar year changes
for 1999 to 2000. </p>

<p><strong>Q: Has the hospital&#146;s equipment been tested?</strong></p>

<p>A: All of our equipment has been tested or it is in the process of being tested. Right
now we&#146;re double-checking our first diagnosis and fixes.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What equipment won&#146;t work?</strong></p>

<p>A: All of the equipment on our critical list &#150; the equipment used in
life-threatening situations &#150; either passed the Y2K compatibility test, has been
fixed and now is Y2K Ready, has been taken out of service, or is planned to be fixed.
Other pieces of equipment are not considered Y2K Ready because the date function will not
work however the machine itself will still work. This means that our health care
professionals can still use that particular piece of equipment, but must record the date
and time of the test manually. </p>

<p><strong>Q: Isn&#146;t all hospital equipment considered critical?</strong></p>

<p>A: A piece of equipment used for patient diagnosis or treatment in life-threatening
situations is considered critical. Sometimes we can make use of other equipment when a
certain piece of equipment fails temporarily, or in this case, because of Y2K
incompatibility. If the function of that piece of equipment can&#146;t be duplicated or
replaced temporarily by another type of equipment, then it is placed on the critical list
for replacement. </p>

<p><strong>Q: What happens if the power fails?</strong></p>

<p>A: The Credit Valley Hospital has two back-up power generators that will provide us
with emergency power should the normal power supply be interrupted. Our emergency power
systems are tested on a weekly basis to assure readiness for use at any time.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Will you have water?</strong></p>

<p>A: Should the municipal water supply fail, the hospital will have emergency supplies
available.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How will I know if the hospital is in trouble? How will I know if I should
go to another hospital?</strong></p>

<p>A: We have to make certain assumptions during this unusual time. Our external service
providers such as our power and water suppliers have also been testing their systems and
are confident they will continue to operate when the calendar year changes. Based on that,
and our backup systems at the hospital, you should feel confident that the hospital will
continue to operate during an emergency situation.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Should I call the hospital to check to see if everything is alright?</strong></p>

<p>A: As noted above, we would like you to assume everything is operating as usual at the
hospital. </p>

<p><strong>Q: Will you have additional staff at the hospital in event of Y2K problems?</strong></p>

<p>A: We have a special Y2K Team that will be on duty New Year&#146;s Eve through to
January 5<sup>th</sup> to deal with any unforeseen problems that occur as a result of the
changeover from 1999 to 2000. Other staff will be &quot;on call&quot; should they be
required.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Will there be delays in service if I come to the hospital on January 1st?</strong></p>

<p>A: We hope it will be &quot;business as usual&quot; on January 1<sup>st</sup> but
because of the unpredictable nature of medical emergency load during this period we cannot
make any guarantees.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is there a chance that surgeries will be cancelled?</strong></p>

<p>A: We traditionally decrease the number of surgeries performed over the holiday season.
We will be operating at a reduced level of service &#150; much like a weekend level of
service. Emergency surgeries will be performed as required.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is there a chance medical records might be lost in the changeover?</strong></p>

<p>A: All of our medical records have been &quot;backed up&quot; on the hospital servers
which are Y2K compliant.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Will my doctor&#146;s office be Y2K compliant?</strong></p>

<p>A: Doctors do not work directly for the hospital. Please check with your doctor&#146;s
office.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Will there still be ambulance service?</strong></p>

<p>A: The Credit Valley Hospital does not manage the ambulance service.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is The Credit Valley Hospital working alone or with other hospitals on the
Y2K issue?</strong></p>

<p>A: We have developed our Y2K testing format based on guidelines from the Ontario
Hospital Association. As well, we have been working with our external suppliers and local
service providers in order to coordinate our readiness activities. However, it is the
responsibility of each hospital or service provider to ensure that they have tested,
repaired, replaced or eliminated pieces of equipment that may be impacted by the change to
the new millenium.</p>
