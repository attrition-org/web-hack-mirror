<p align="center" style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)"><a name="And Its Impact"><strong><font face="default" size="4">And Its Impact</font></strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800080"><strong><em>More Patients... Sicker Patients</em></strong></font></p>

<p>In 1993/94, 40% of the patients coming to the ER were in the life-threatening or urgent
category.&nbsp; Today the rate is 60%.</p>

<p>The acuity (seriousness) of the mental illnesses has risen over the past year which
means patients are staying in hospital for longer periods of time.&nbsp; As a result, we
need to add at least five more inpatient beds on the psychiatric unit.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800080"><strong><em>More Kids...</em></strong></font></p>

<p>One third of our ER patients (approximately 20,000 per year) are children and that will
increase again because of our designation as the regional paediatric centre.&nbsp; As a
result, our multidisciplinary team will require more resources and specialized skills.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800080"><strong><em>Care Shift...</em></strong></font></p>

<p><img src="ccu2.gif" alt="CCU" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="288"> More clinical
intervention, diagnostic testing and observation in ER rather than admitting patients to
hospital beds.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800080"><strong><em>More Treatment Spaces But Still
Overcrowded...</em></strong></font></p>

<p>The Emergency Department increased the number of stretchers from 19 to 34, but more
often than not, at least half of those are occupied by patients waiting to be admitted to
inpatient beds.</p>

<p>It's a similar story on the hemodialysis unit.&nbsp; Treatment stations have been
expanded from 32 to 40 for over 240 patients.&nbsp; Portable water is now required for 4
of the 40 stations emphasizing the need to consolidate the department into one area.
&nbsp; A home hemodialysis program will be implemented during the summer.&nbsp; As the
graph shows, the number of dialysis patients will continue to increase.</p>

<p><img src="renal.gif" alt="Rernal" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="200"> The Quick
Response Team and Crisis Intervention Team provide specialized support and services to ER
patients to plan patients' discharge and arrange for community services once they return
home.</p>

<p>The staff nurses from the Palliative Care Unit has developed a bereavement program for
families who are coping with the loss of their loved one.&nbsp; the intent of the
follow-up, approximately three months after their loved ones death, is to see how the
family is managing and to offer community services as appropriate.</p>

<p>Credit Valley Pro Health is a joint venture that provides a variety of home respiratory
care services including oxygen, nasal CPAP units and aerosol compressors.&nbsp; The past
winter was extremely busy with respiratory related illnesses at the hospital. &nbsp;
Through CVH Pro Health, the respiratory therapists were able to help many patients meet
their discharge needs.</p>

<p>The Cardiovascular Rehabilitation Program is expanding to include all patients with
athersclerotic disease.&nbsp; The number of exercise classes will double.&nbsp; As well, a
cardiovascular patient registry is being sent up to improve client education and
multi-variable research.&nbsp; The program is currently running above capacity with over
500 patient visits per month.</p>

<p>As a result of a two-year quality improvement initiative at the hospital, there is now
a common assessment tool for potential skin breakdown to be used in the Region of Peel.
&nbsp; Skin care products are reviewed, categorized and product protocols created to
assist community caregivers in maintaining good skin care once patients return home.</p>

Programs To Meet Our Patients Growing Needs...</strong></font></a></p>

<p>Epilepsy Mississauga funds the new weekly multidisciplinary clinic for epilepsy
outpatients.&nbsp; Patients receive neurology, nursing and drug therapy counseling.</p>

<p>A Rheumatology clinic was added to the outpatient services at CVH in the Fall of 1998.
&nbsp; the patients have access to a rheumatologist, occupational therapist,
physiotherapist, pharmacist as well as a nurse.</p>

<p><img src="Abby_Breast_Biopsy.gif" alt="Abby" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="150"> The Imaging Department installed an Advanced Breast Biopsy
Instrumentation System (ABBI) this year.&nbsp; The ABBI system helps in the early
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.&nbsp; The ABBI procedure has proven to be less
invasive than the traditional surgical procedure.</p>

<p>As a result of recommendations by the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians and
in association with the National Emergency Nurses Association, CVH adopted a five level
triage system.&nbsp; The new system more accurately differentiates patients level of
sickness.</p>

<p>The Child and Family Outpatient Mental Health Service has begun The Sensory
Communication Group co-lead by a Speech Language Pathologist &amp; Occupational Therapist.
&nbsp; The group helps parents develop communication strategies and a variety of
activities and approaches to address their child's specific needs in other areas including
motor planning &amp; social skills.&nbsp; Videotapes of parent and child interactions are
used as a teaching tool to provide immediate feedback &amp; discussion around strategies
implemented during the group.&nbsp; </p>

<p><img src="Speech__Audiology.gif" alt="Speech" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="150"> New equipment for high tech hearing aid evaluation and
programming has been operational over the past year.&nbsp; Feedback from patients has been
enthusiastic.&nbsp; In addition, the audiology staff have collaborated with the regional
pre-school speech program to provide a weekly audiology clinic for children who will enter
the speech program.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800080"><strong><em>To Promote Wellness...</em></strong></font></p>

<p><img src="Paeds_Hurt_Alert.gif" alt="Paeds" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="250"> This year a Paediatric Neuropsychology Service was introduced to
develop treatments and interventions to help children with intellectual, behaviour and
personality impairments achieve their fullest potential within the school, community and
at home.&nbsp; Our hospital is the only facility to provide this service in the Peel
Region.</p>

<p><img src="Special_Care_Nursery.gif" alt="Special" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="200"> In April, we began seeing children in our catchment area who
previously were directed to the Hospital for Sick Children for their care.&nbsp; This
clinic was created as part of our regional role as the Centre for maternal, newborn and
child health services for South Peel/Halton cluster of hospitals.&nbsp; As well, newborns
from our area, who were delivered pre-term at a tertiary hospital, are now receiving the
remainder of their hospital care at CVH.</p>

<p>We are also increasing our capacity to care for high risk antenatal patients from
tertiary hospitals such as Mt. Sinai Hospital and Women's College Hospital so our
projected numbers of births is quite significant.&nbsp; Also as part of our expanded
regional role, we will be increasing our paediatric surgery.</p>

<p><img src="Kangaroo__Baby.gif" alt="Kangaroo" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100"> Our Special Care Nursery has launched its Kangaroo Care
Program.&nbsp; The concept encourages mom or dad to cuddle their newborn, skin to skin,
much like a mother kangaroo keeps her baby next to her inside her pouch.&nbsp; Kangaroo
Care creates conditions for baby similar to those womb, such as the proximity of the
mothers heartbeat, sounds of her voice and the gentle rhythmic rocking of her
breathing.&nbsp; Arms and legs which it protects the infant and offers a reprieve from the
stressful elements of the Newborn Intensive Care Unit.&nbsp; Mom or Dad cuddles with baby,

<p>Over the last year we've increased the number of <font color="#FF0000">laparascopic
surgeries</font> in gynaecology and general surgery.&nbsp; Because this type of surgery
requires only tiny incisions, our patients' discomfort and recovery times are
minimized.&nbsp; That means shorter lengths of stay in hospital for patients, which keeps
our costs per procedure to a minimum.&nbsp; It also means we can do more surgeries!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">The Renal Program</font> is now providing plasmapheresis
(therapeutic plasma exchange) and continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT).&nbsp;
Patients who require plasmapheresis are referred to the renal program from the oncology,
neurology and renal services. &nbsp; Previously patients were transferred to Toronto for
plasampheresis resulting in some fragmentation of care.&nbsp; Now we provide a more
streamlined approach for these patients requiring plasma exchange as a result of an
auto-immune disease (eg. Multiple Sclerosis).</p>

<p>Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy benefits those patients who are suffering from
renal failure as an acute episode.&nbsp; Therapy is continued until the patient is able to
tolerate haemodialysis or their renal function improves.&nbsp; In addition, patients who
are in chronic renal failure, who are unable to tolerate the physiological effects of
haemodialysis, benefit from this therapy:</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Surgery and rehabilitation</font> programs pooled their efforts
to provide the &quot;fast track hip project&quot;.&nbsp; Patients who have elective total
hip replacements or fractured hips may be candidates for the program.&nbsp; Expedited
referral and transfer to rehabilitation allows for more intensive physiotherapy which
increases the patient's mobility; their satisfaction and decreases their length of stay in
hospital.&nbsp; It's a win-win solution for all concerned!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">The Laboratory</font> has a new Laser Scanning Cytometer... the
first in Canada!&nbsp; This equipment provides the oncologists with precise information
about certain tumours (lymphomas) and blood disorders (leukemias) which are now required
before treatment can be given.&nbsp; Previously specimens had to be sent to Toronto or
Hamilton on a stat basis so that testing could begin as soon as possible.&nbsp; Now as a
result of this new technology, the results can be obtained here, on an as needed basis and
in a much shorter time, using a method that is both less expensive and requires a much
smaller sample from the patient.</p>

<p>As the saying goes, a little knowledge goes a long way.&nbsp; As proof, note the
dramatic decrease in emergency visits and inpatient hospital stay for children since the
implementation of the <font color="#FF0000">Asthma Education Centre Program</font>.&nbsp;
The program is operated in partnership with Health Alliance, a division of Astra Pharma
Inc.</p>

<p><img src="puff.gif" alt="puff" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="75"> The Roaring Adventures of Puff (RAP) the asthma education dragon, has been
instrumental in making children more aware of their personal &quot;triggers&quot; to
asthma events, and taking preventive action, which in turn reduces the number of emergency
room visits and hospitalization.</p>

<p>Sometimes we as caregivers&nbsp;are so entrenched in what we do that we do our jobs
without explaining what we're about to do, or what the outcomes of certain procedures
should be.</p>

<p>Our <font color="#FF0000">clinical pathways</font> will help patients and families
understand their in-hospital care from beginning to end.&nbsp; In other words, a clinical
pathway outlines how to do what should be done. It includes the schedule of routine care
and is developed by the entire multidisciplinary team, including physicians, nurses,
psychologists, pharmacists, occupational therapists etc.&nbsp; They are based on the most
recent findings in the research literature.</p>

<p>These pathways will also help us to improve our communication with patients, which is
often the underlying cause of patient complaints.&nbsp; We're developing a new patient
feedback process that will encourage patients and families and staff to deal with concerns
immediately, at the point of concern.&nbsp; We see this process as part of our commitment
to ongoing quality patient care.&nbsp; So don't be shy.&nbsp; Tell us how we can
improve... and of course we'd like your praise as well... everybody needs a little
&quot;shot in the arm&quot; now and then!</p>

<p>As noted in the section entitled &quot;And For the Little Ones&quot;, we've initiated
some new services and plans are underway for the physical development of the new <font color="#FF0000">regional centre for maternal, newborn and child health</font> services
which will provide care closer to home, for higher risk patients.&nbsp; We will
collaborate with our neighboring hospitals, community services and caregivers to develop a
better continuum of care.</p>

<p><img src="adding.gif" alt="Adding" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="75"> Labour and Delivery is using an Auto Valet system to provide nurses with
their scrubs. &nbsp; In the past, staff would get their OR scrubs from the OR change
room.&nbsp; Often there were none available or staff had to go into the male change room
to obtain a scrub. &nbsp; The Auto Valet system allows staff to go down to the linen room,
place a card into the machine which then provides the scrubs.&nbsp; Staff no longer run
out of scrubs or have to go into the male change room.&nbsp; The end result to all this is
that staff are then not delayed coming on duty to care for patients.&nbsp; The new system
also reduces theft of scrubs... over $800 a month in labour alone!</p>

<p><img src="Ambulance.gif" alt="Ambulance" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="80"> The Emergency Department expansion was a milestone for 1998/99,
increasing treatment spaces from 19 to 34.&nbsp; The new 'ER' is designed around 3 Patient
Care Zones for emergent (life-threatening), urgent and non-urgent conditions.</p>

<p>The Credit Valley Hospital Emergency Department is among the busiest 'ER's' in Metro
and 905/GTA with approximately 60,000 visits per year.&nbsp; Despite the additional space
and improvement in function, the 'ER' continues to experience the impact increasing demand
for hospital services from our growing community.</p>

<p>There is a trend which sees increasing levels of acuity/sicker patients to the
Emergency Department that has been experienced for the last several years.&nbsp; For
example, in 1993/94, 40 percent of the patients coming to the Emergency Department were in
the life-threatening or urgent category.&nbsp; For 1998/99, the rate has increased to 60
percent.</p>

<p>As well, the type of care provided in the 'ER' has shifted over the past several years
with more clinical intervention, diagnostic testing and observation care being provided in
the 'ER', whenever possible, in place of admission to a hospital bed.</p>

<p>The Quick Response Team and Crisis Intervention Team are an integral part of the
Emergency Programme team and provide specialized support and services to patients in the
ER to facilitate discharge and arrange community services for patients and families.
&nbsp; Through changes in clinical practice and admission avoidance strategies, the rate
of admissions has remained low, although a gradual increase has been noted over the past
year.</p>

<p>The Credit Valley Hospital Emergency Department also serves a large population of
children with paediatric visits, one-third of the visits to 'ER' or approximately 20,000
per year.&nbsp; The high volume of paediatric patients requires additional resources and
specialized skills among the multidisciplinary team, to provide care for children and
families.</p>

<p>So you can see from the information in our report, why our Board of Governors and our
administration are repeatedly making the case for funding.&nbsp; We need funding to
continue to provide the existing services to our growing population.&nbsp; We need capital
funding to expand our hospital in order to house additional beds and space for the
outpatient services.&nbsp; At the time of writing, The Credit Valley Hospital is well
below the per capital funding for the province and the rest of the GTA/905 area.</p>

<p>The hospital was rescued from an overwhelming deficit this year as a result of an
additional $5.5 million in one-time transitional funding.&nbsp; We are optimistic that an
external review of our hospital operations and growth study will result in funding that
will truly meet our patients needs.</p>

<p>The Peel Public Health Department continues to partner with us to maintain our 24/74
hour discharge program via the postpartum clinic program.&nbsp; Seventy percent of our new
moms are able to participate in the program.&nbsp; Eighty-five percent of those new moms
attend the postpartum clinics.</p>

<p>More than 700 volunteers lend their time, talent and expertise to the hospital. &nbsp;
They are the people who govern the hospital and our foundations as well as the volunteers
who transport patients, lend a hand or a listening ear, or greet you in the gift
shop.&nbsp; Their support is critical to our patients, staff and physicians.&nbsp; We
sincerely appreciate them.</p>

Their Goal This Year!</strong></em></font></p>

<p>The Gift Shop, HELLP Lottery, Bingo and Bazaar exceeded their expectations which
resulted in $245,100 in donations.</p>

<p>The Gift Shops continued to modernize their operations with the addition of
&quot;Interac&quot; purchases and a new computerized cash register to allow better and
more detailed accounting.&nbsp; The Econo Centre expanded and now boasts shelving and
wider aisles.&nbsp; This year's bazaar was also a huge success with more vendors than the
Restaurant could handle - some had to be accommodated in the hallways.&nbsp; The Bazaar
raised $3,000.00 more than budgeted.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800080"><em><strong>The Credit Valley Hospital Foundation
Enjoyed Another Banner Year!</strong></em></font></p>

<p>Their annual fund achieved 6% over their goal by the end of fiscal 98/99.&nbsp; Patient
support increased by 139% to an all time high.&nbsp; &quot;Le Moulin Rouge&quot; - the
Foundation's annual Valentine's Gala raised the most ever - $150,000 and provided a sell
out crowd of 600 a memorable evening of fine French food, entertainment, wining and
dining.</p>

<p><img src="http://as-pc19/cvh/web_annual%20report/friends.gif" alt="friends" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100"> Our community raised
$200,000 through group activities, including more than a dozen golf tournaments staged by
our citizens.&nbsp; Our corporate partner, Mead Johnson, re-launched our Kids' Club known
as the BirthDay Club which resulted in a 41% increase in membership in a six month
period.&nbsp; The Club Meadowvale Fit &amp; Fund Tent Annual Challenge raised
$25,000.&nbsp; A record breaker Millennium Challenge is in the works.</p>

<p>Extraordinary volunteer leadership and commitment from Committee Chairmen Hilda Yorke

<p>&quot;Excellence is a great word to describe the hospital.&nbsp; Yet can it describe
the warmth of caring that envelopes you as soon as the hospital doors open for you and the
smiles that shine bright and lovely through the darkest night of pain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Couldn't be better.&nbsp; Top of their profession professionals.&nbsp; Your
hospital could easily be #1 in Canada.&nbsp; Thanks a million for this oasis in a sea of
misery.&nbsp; Not a very good description but sincere.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since my release I have done nothing but sing the praises of Credit Valley.
&nbsp; If ever there were a hospital that deserves funding for anything they desire, it is
you people.&nbsp; As a tax payer, it is really good to feel that our hard earned dollars
are going to the facilities that deserve it, like yours...&nbsp; If you are going to give,
give where the 'credit' is due!&quot;</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Our Renal Dialysis Program</font> takes a proactive approach to
patient care.&nbsp; They are currently following 170 patients with kidney disease who will
most likely require dialysis in the future.&nbsp; As well, pre-transplantation preparation
is a large focus of the program.&nbsp; Our caregivers monitor over 150 patients who are
waiting for transplants. &nbsp; The post-kidney transplant clinic provides follow-up and
support to more than 85 kidney transplant recipients.</p>

<p>The hospital has a new newspaper entitles<font color="#FF0000"> &quot;A Credit To Your
Health&quot;</font>.&nbsp; The paper, which is circulated as a special supplement every
other month in the Mississauga News, is designed to keep our patients and families
informed about new services and programs at the hospital and through our partners in the
community.</p>

just the kids who are surfing the net these days.&nbsp; More and more health care
consumers are searching for reliable health information via their internet
connections.&nbsp; Although The Credit Valley Hospital has had its own website for several
years, it was time for a facelift and a broader range of information.&nbsp; To that end,
the hospital has partnered with health information specialists, Healthgate, to provide our
patients with the most up to date health literature.&nbsp; </p>

Do We Know We're Doing The Right Thing</strong></font></a></p>

<p>Each patient care program has developed <font color="#FF0000">performance measures</font>
including key indicators to evaluate outcomes over time, such as shifts from inpatient to
outpatient management, waiting times, length of stay, re-admission rates.&nbsp; Our
clinical focus studies identify opportunities for clinical improvement and process
improvement including procedures such as simple appendectomy, ectopic pregnancy, vascular
access devices and chemotherapy administration.&nbsp; As well, the hospital is developing
clinical practice guidelines for implementation and evaluation of evidence-based practice
for diagnoses such as paediatric croup and gastroenteritis, management of chest pain and
indications for emergency CT scans.</p>

<p>Another way we know we're doing things right is by <font color="#FF0000">benchmarking</font>
ourselves with other hospitals of similar size and scope, across the country.&nbsp; The
Credit Valley Hospital is &quot;a benchmark facility&quot; particularly in areas such as
cardiac care.&nbsp; In a recent published report by the Institute for Clinical Evaluative
Sciences, Credit Valley hospital was cited as the leading community hospital in short-term
death rates for people suffering heart attacks.&nbsp; As the graph indicates, CVH is
aggressively managing patients presenting with heart attacks in the emergency department
and has taken the lead position in mortality reduction in less than a year!&nbsp; All of
our emergency RN and physician staff have been trained to provide this life saving
thrombolytic therapy which reduces damage to the heart muscle during a myocardial
infarction.</p>

<p>The Credit Valley Hospital, through a <font color="#FF0000">two-year
quality-improvement project</font> is one of the leading hospitals in preventing
hospital-acquired pressure ulcers.&nbsp; These ulcers, more commonly referred to as bed
sores, are often very painful, and debilitating, thus interfering with the patient's
overall comfort and quality of life.&nbsp; They are often very difficult to heal.&nbsp;
The hospital believes its protocols and review of skin care products has resulted in its
enviable position in curbing the number of hospital-acquired wounds.&nbsp; Only 4.1% of
CVH patients surveyed developed these wounds while in hospital, compared with the national
benchmark average of 5.8%.</p>
