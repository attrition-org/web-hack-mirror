    <h2>Preparing Your Child For Hospitalization</h2>
    <p><img align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" hspace="10" SRC="kiddoc.gif" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="143"> <i>Children
    and Hospitals</i></p>
    <p>Hospitalization can be a stressful time for children. Although each child is unique,
    they tend to display similar behaviours while in the hospital. These include:<ul>
      <li>anger<br>
      </li>
      <li>regression<br>
      </li>
      <li>increased irritability<br>
      </li>
      <li>fear<br>
      </li>
      <li>modified eating habits<br>
      </li>
      <li>withdrawal<br>
      </li>
      <li>clinging to parents and staff<br>
      </li>
      <li>dependency<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Children need to have trust in their doctors, nurses and other medical staff. Parents
    can build this trust by honestly explaining to your child why he/she needs
    hospitalization, what will happen during the hospital stay, and where you will be during
    that time. Your child's comfort is dependent on a joint effort by you and the hospital
    staff.</p>
    <h2>The Credit Valley Hospital's Child Life Program</h2>
    <p>The Child Life Program on the Pediatric Unit of the Credit Valley Hospital provides
    play and learning experiences to:<ul>
      <li>help reduce anxiety related to hospitalization</li>
      <li>prepare children for hospital procedures (for example, casting) through medical play</li>
      <li>promotes normal growth and development</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tips For Reducing A Child's Anxiety During Hospitalization</h2>
    <p><img align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" hspace="10" SRC="kidnurse.gif" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="148"> <ul>
      <li>Be sure to have your child bring a treasured prossession, like a stuffed animal, book,
        doll or favourite pajamas. These items should be labelled with the child's name.</li>
      <li>Bring a picture of family members or pets.</li>
      <li>If you have access to a tape recorder, prepare a tape of your child's favourite stories
        and songs. This will be a comforting reminder of home.</li>
      <li>Always tell your child when and why you are leaving, especially if you are going home.
        Leave a special object behind when you leave for a short time or when you go home (please
        do not leave valuables!). Your child will be proud of having the responsibility of caring
        for an important possession.</li>
      <li>If your child is old enough, encourage him/her to phone you.</li>
      <li>If you cannot make the hospital visit as planned, call the unit (905-813-4420) and have
        someone notify your child of the delay. He/she may be sad and angry, but not as worried as
        he/she might otherwise be. Arrange with a family member or friend to visit when you are
        unable to be there.</li>
      <li>If you and your child attended a pre-admission tour, reinforce all you have learned.</li>
      <li>Be honest. Tell your child about the hospital - what will be done and why. Assure
        him/her that there is a beginning and an end to his/her experience. If something will
        hurt, tell your child.</li>
      <li>Reassure your child that you understand what he/she is going through and, if possible,
        that you will be with him/her.</li>
      <li>Be matter-of-fact. The medical procedure must be done, so give your child support. If
        your child sees that you are anxious, he/she will be anxious.</li>
      <li>Allow your child to be as independent as possible. Let him/her make choices.</li>
      <li>Be nurturing and loving. Praise your child for his/her accomplishments.</li>
      <li>Show your child lots of affection; now is the time for hugs and kisses.</li>
      <li>While we welcome you to bring your child gifts, please be aware that balloons are not
        allowed on the Pediatric Unit at The Credit Valley Hospital. Balloons can be very
        dangerous when they break. Please also let family members know this. Some suggested
        alternate gifts include craft kits, crayons/markers, and books.</li>
      <li>While you are with your child in the hospital, ease the tension for yourself as well as
        for your child by bringing along slippers, a book or needlework, or by writing a letter. A
        little self-indulgence can also be helpful in moments of stress and exhaustion. The Credit
        Valley Hospital's Pediatric Unit has a washroom for parents, equipped with a shower.
        &nbsp; You will need to&nbsp; bring your own toiletries and towel from home.</li>
      <li>If you are nervous, share your nervousness with a staff member. Remember, the staff are
        here to help you.</li>
      <li>Constantly being with your child can be stressful, especially if you are worrying about
        other children at home. If possible, try to take an afternoon off and go home or spend a
        few hours going out to lunch with a friend during your child's naptime. Even a half-hour
        alone in the hospital restaurant, a walk on the hospital grounds, or a rest in the family
        room can be helpful.</li>
      <li>The Credit Valley Hospital's Pediatric Unit has an indoor playroom, a family room and an
        outdoor playground. It is staffed by a Child Life Worker, along with the assistance of
        volunteers and students. If your child is unable to leave his/her room, the Child Life
        Worker will provide play opportunities, medical play, and other activities at your child's
        bedside.</li>
      <li><i>If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Child Life Program, on the
        Paediatric Unit, at (905) 813-4420.</i></li>
