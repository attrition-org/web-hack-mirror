    <p>The Credit Valley Hospital Foundation, incorporated in 1980, is a not-for-profit
    organization responsible for raising money&nbsp; for the Hospital from the private sector.</p>
    <p>The Foundation is governed by a Board of Directors chosen to represent as broadly as
    possible the community served by the Hospital. Members of this Board chair a number of
    committees that include the Corporate Committee, Hospital Family Committee, Golf
    Committee, Service Clubs, Major Gifts Committee, Gala Committee and Planned Giving
    Committee. Volunteers from all areas of the community serve on these committees.</p>
    <p><font color="#001058" size="5">How donations are used</font></p>
    <p>The Foundation raises money for the purchase of equipment and the improvement of
    patient care facilities. It exists solely to raise funds for The Credit Valley Hospital.
    Since 1980 more than $12,000,000 has been raised from the private sector.</p>
    <p>Major funding has gone to the original Building Fund and the CT-Scanner. In addition,
    monies have been transferred from the Foundation to every department and unit of the
    Hospital.</p>
    <p><font color="#001058" size="5">The current need</font></p>
    <p>We now require significant financial support to replace outdated and overused equipment
    and to enable us to improve the quality of patient care through expansion. &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Expansion of&nbsp; many areas has become necessary due to a dramatic increase in the
    number of patients we serve.</p>
    <p><font color="#001058" size="5">How can I give?</font></p>
    <p>Donations can be made in cash, by cheque or money order, or put on your Visa,
    Mastercard or American Express account.&nbsp; We also accept pre-authorized monthly
    payments.&nbsp; If you wish to make your donation in person, please come to the Foundation
    Office off the lobby on the main level of the Hospital. <b>You may phone in your credit
    card donation to (905) 813-4123.</b> Cheques and money orders should be made payable to
    &quot;The Credit Valley Hospital Foundation&quot;. If you wish to mail your contribution,
    please address it to:</p>

    <p>We look forward to offering &quot;donations through the internet&quot; in the near
    future.&nbsp; Contributions can be designated for a piece of equipment or a specific area
    in the Hospital. Ideally the Hospital would like to receive as many undesignated donations
    as possible so that the money can be used where the need is the greatest.</p>

    tax purposes.</p>

    <p><font color="#001058" size="5">Commonly Asked Questions</font></p>
    <p><b>Can I work in whatever area I want?</b><br>
    Volunteers only work in areas in which staff has expressed a need for volunteer help. If
    you are interested in such an area and you are available to work at a time when they need
    help, then chances are good that you will be selected.</p>
    <p><b>Can I take holidays?</b><br>
    Yes, of course. But we do expect you to let us know when you are going on holidays and
    when you are returning. Any volunteer who is off of work for two consecutive months -
    without letting the volunteer department know - will automatically be removed from our
    active list and their position will be filled by a new volunteer.</p>
    <p><b>I need to do 10 hours of volunteer work for school. Can I do this?</b><br>
    The answer is - no. We do not accept any volunteers for short term assignments. We will
    not sign any letters of recommendation until one full term of volunteering has been
    completed (one complete school term or one complete summer term).</p>
    <p><b>What kind of jobs need to be done?</b><br>
    Volunteers do jobs that the staff need help with. This includes sales, help in the gift
    shop and clerical work. All volunteers do work which is non-medical (hands off) work.
    Volunteers are never allowed to do anything which might jeopardize the patients' good
    care.</p>
    <p><b>I want to help develop and implement new fundraising ideas. Can I?</b><br>
    Yes. The <a href="#assoc">Associates</a> (Auxiliary) are always looking for bright,
    interested people to serve on their committees and boards. The Associates are involved in
    helping to raise much needed funds for capital equipment in the Hospital.</p>
