    <p align="center"><strong>Barbara Clive, MD, FRCPC<br>
    Chief of Medical Staff</strong></p>
    <p align="left">For the Medical Staff of The Credit Valley Hospital the past year can best
    be described as &quot;in limbo&quot; - - a state of uncertainty. After years of budget
    cuts, we received the Health Services Restructuring Committee directives which gave us the
    message to start rebuilding and expanding our hospital to meet the future needs of our
    growing population. These directives arrived at a time of ongoing fiscal restraint as our
    budget was still insufficient to meet the growing patient volumes.</p>
    <p align="left">The inquest into the untimely death of young Kyle Martyn, and the strength
    shown by his family during this difficult review in the Fall of 1998, touched the hearts
    of all staff. Unfortunately, Kyle&#146;s death could not have been avoided. However, his
    unfortunate death served a purpose in that it focussed public attention on lengthy waits
    in our emergency department, and the serious overcrowding and insufficient resources we
    are experiencing as a result of financial cutbacks. Physicians and staff continue to work
    with increasing patient volumes and workloads. They have taken on the added responsibility
    of planning for the new regional cancer centre, regional maternal child program and an
    increased number of inpatient beds in the areas of Mental Health, Rehabilitation,
    Continuing Care and Acute Care. The staff has rapidly changed mindsets from one of
    cutbacks to future planning. Our success in doing so can be attributed to the continued
    dedication to innovation and leadership that has always existed at The Credit Valley
    Hospital.</p>
    <p align="left">The Restructuring Commission left our hospital with independent
    governance. We were not merged into a larger corporation of hospitals. The Medical
    Advisory Committee began to explore what aspects of our hospital would make us unique and
    attractive to quality medical practitioners in the midst of larger corporations around us.
    We began to focus on our strengths in teaching and research recognizing that these are the
    foundation of maintenance and enhancement of quality patient care. The Credit Valley
    Hospital has always been very involved, in a voluntary way, with teaching of physicians
    and other regulated health professionals. Dr. Srigley, Chief, Laboratory Medicine, is
    chairing a task force to explore ways to participate more formally in medical teaching
    with the universities around us. A great deal of clinical research has gone on at CVH for
    many years. The volume of studies approved by our Research Review Committee continues to
    grow and we have now made a commitment to establish an office of Clinical Research to
    centralize and standardize our approach to research.</p>
    <p align="left">Changes in medical leadership included the resignation of Dr. Steven
    Hirsch, Chief of Family Medicine, so that he could pursue other volunteer community
    commitments. Dr. David Clarkson served as the Acting Chief of Family Medicine and was
    subsequently appointed by the Board as the new department chief. He has provided strong
    leadership at a time of change within the department. The role of the family physician
    needs clarification during these times of increased specialization and regionalization of
    medical services. The hospital remains committed to enhancing the role of family medicine
    in the hospital, recognizing they are key to continuity of patient care and our link to
    the community. Dr. Marino Battigelli was reappointed as the Chief of Psychiatry and we
    look forward to another five years of outstanding leadership. The search for a Chief of
    Anaesthesia continues and we appreciate the leadership and work by Mr. Peter Smith, the
    volunteer Board member, on the Search Committee. We are grateful to Dr. Dyke for his
    ongoing commitment in this role after two terms as chief. The hospital suffered a great
    loss at the passing of Dr. Donald Black, founding chief of the department of Obstetrics
    and Gynaecology, on September 12 , 1998. Much of our success as a leader in maternal care
    can be attributed to the vision and high standards of Dr. Black. I appreciate the effort
    by the entire department in continuing to provide patient care in one of our busiest
    departments following the loss of a colleague and friend.</p>
    <p align="left">We remain poised for innovation and growth yet the upcoming year&#146;s
    budget at this time is still less than the actual budget of last year. These past few
    years have been difficult for the creative minds of The Credit Valley Hospital. In the
    words of Helen Keller, &quot;one can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to
    soar&quot;. In the years ahead we will soar again.</p>
