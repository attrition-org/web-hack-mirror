    <p><font size="3">The word at CVH is growth.&nbsp; Peel Region is growing... &nbsp;
    Mississauga is growing...&nbsp; the population served by CVH is growing...And in
    1998/1999, the Foundation is pleased to report that our list of friends and the donations
    they have given is also growing!</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The Foundation raised more than $1.3 million, representing an increase
    of 6% over our projected goal this year. We are happy to welcome 2,500 new donors to our
    family of community spirited friends.&nbsp; Funds were raised through various initiatives
    including events, direct mail, individual giving, corporate solicitations, in memoriam and
    planned gifts, Service Clubs and employee and physician appeals.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The Foundation encourages unrestricted giving so that the
    Hospital&#146;s Board of Governors may direct funds received from the Foundation to the
    Hospital&#146;s greatest needs. Many donors however choose to designate their funds to
    specific departments or equipment (See attached chart re: designated gifts).</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Significant increases have been received in the areas of patient
    solicitation, events staged on our behalf by members of our community, and the re-launch
    of the Kids Club as a BirthDay Club commemorating births and anniversaries of children
    born at The Credit Valley Hospital. In 1998/99, Monster Bingos were included in Foundation
    efforts and more than $46,000 was raised as a result of two events.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The future of The Credit Valley Hospital continues its focus on growth
    and the Foundation continues its challenge to meet these needs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">A feasibility study for a Capital Campaign was conducted early this
    year. A steering committee exists to prepare for a major capital expansion campaign which
    will include a radiation treatment centre, Level II high risk birthing and paediatric
    centre, ambulatory care expansion and many other vital support areas urgently required to
    service these additions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The Foundation sincerely thanks the donors and volunteers who made last
    year a success. We pledge to keep you informed of all our plans both in the Annual Fund
    and our forthcoming Capital Campaign.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">On behalf of the Board of Directors of The Credit Valley Hospital
    Foundation and all the patients who benefit from your interest and generosity, we salute
    you and wish you a healthy and happy summer!</font></p>
