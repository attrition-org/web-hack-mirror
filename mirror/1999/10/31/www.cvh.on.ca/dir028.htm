<p>Description:</b><br>
If you have cancer or are caring for someone with cancer, it can help to talk to someone
who's &quot;been there&quot; - who has asked the same questions, gone through the same
experience, and understands the challenges.</p>

<p>CancerConnection will help you connect by phone with someone who has had an experience
like yours. You will be asked a few questions about diagnosis, treatment, and your
personal situation to help match you with the most suitable trained volunteer. All calls
are confidential.</p>
