schizophrenia?</a></font></strong></b><font SIZE="2"></p>
</font>

<p>Schizophrenia is a common mental illness affecting one in one hundred people. Common
characteristics are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is a medical (biological) illness believed to be caused by a biochemical imbalance
  in the brain. </p>
  <p>It may have multiple causes or even be multiple illnesses. </p>
  <p>It usually occurs in persons&#146; late teens or early twenties, but may occur earlier
  or later.</p>
  <i><b><font FACE="Arial"><p></font><font face="default"><a NAME="_Toc446251599">How is
  schizophrenia treated?</a></font></b></i></p>
  <p>Schizophrenia is a medical condition, which is treatable but not yet curable.
  Currently, it is treated with medications called anti-psychotic agents or neuroleptics. </p>
  <i><b><font FACE="Arial"><p></font><font face="default"><a NAME="_Toc446251600">What are
  the effects of schizophrenia?</a></font></b></i></p>
  <p>Each person experiences schizophrenia differently. When the illness first begins, one
  might experience social withdrawal and a decline in functioning. One might also experience
  hallucinations, delusions, difficulty thinking, and lack of energy and motivation. These
  are all common symptoms of the illness, but not everyone experiences all of them. The
  illness is episodic and varies with intensity.</p>
  <i><b><font FACE="Arial"><p></font><font face="default"><a NAME="_Toc446251601">Why is it
  important to understand schizophrenia?</a></font></b></i></p>
  <p>Schizophrenia is one of the most misunderstood illnesses. It is important for you to
  educate yourself and your family so that you can make informed decisions about your
  treatment and rehabilitation. If you have questions ask your doctor or health care
  professional.</p>
  <p>There are community services available to teach you about schizophrenia and how to cope
  and manage this illness.</p>

  NAME="_Toc446251602">The Schizophrenia Program Values and Principles</a></font></strong></b><font
  SIZE="2"></p>
  </font><p>Psychosocial Rehabilitation was defined by The International Association of
  Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services (I.A.P.S.R.S.) Ontario Chapter in 1990, as an
  approach that has been developed in response to the particular needs of people with severe
  psychiatric disabilities. The goal of psychosocial rehabilitation is to improve an
  individual&#146;s quality of life by helping them to take responsibility for their lives
  and to function as actively and independently as possible. Emphasis is placed on consumer
  empowerment and on consumer choice. This approach is based on a set of principles that are
  found in a variety of programs and services. These programs and services are designed to
  both strengthen the individual&#146;s skills and to develop supports necessary to help the
  individual in the community.</p>
  <p>The following is a list of 12 principles The Schizophrenia Program has adapted, and how
  we incorporate these principles into The Schizophrenia Program.</p>
  <b><font SIZE="2"><p>l. </font>Life is a process of growth and change of which all
  individuals are capable.</p>
  </b><p>The program helps members to identify and achieve their highest level of function
  within living, learning, working, social and medical therapeutic environments</p>
  <p><b>2. It is the presence of skills, which will enable individuals to achieve
  satisfaction and success in their environment of choice.</b></p>
  <p>The program teaches skills to members which in turn strengthens an individual&#146;s
  problem-solving capacities and allows members to achieve their goals.</p>
  <b><p>3. People have the right and ability to make decisions. </p>
  </b><p>The program supports the members&#146; ability to make decisions, both good and
  bad, and to grow by their experience of problem-solving.</p>
  <b><p>4. All are entitled to equal opportunity within the normal environment.</p>
  </b><p>Each member has the right to live, learn, work, socialize and receive medical
  treatment in a setting that is supportive, non-restrictive and promotes their maximum
  degree of independence.</p>
  <b><p>5. Growth is a highly individual process.</b><font SIZE="2"></p>
  <p></font>The program respects and accommodates each individual&#146;s growth process.</p>
  <b><p>Each individual is a multi dimensional human being for whom there is always hope for
  growth and change.</p>
  </b><p>The program instills a sense of hope in its members by recognizing each
  individual&#146;s unique potential.</p>
  <b><p>The rehabilitation process is demystified by working in partnership with program
  members.</p>
  </b><p>Members are provided with the opportunity to participate in the program&#146;s
  development and delivery.</p>
  <b><p>Early intervention is essential.</p>
  </b><p>Newly diagnosed individuals will be given priority of service.</p>
  <b><p>Service is not limited to the individual, but incorporates a broader environmental
  responsibility.</p>
  </b><p>The program educates and supports the community at large in identifying and
  reducing the barriers to normal living.</p>
  <b><p>Individuals may require some support throughout their lives in order to achieve
  their goals toward maximum growth.</p>
  </b><p>Service is provided whenever the program staff and individual jointly identify a
  readiness for program involvement.</p>
  <b><p>Involvement in some type of meaningful activity as defined by the individual is
  essential in the development of independence and self esteem.</p>
  </b><p>Opportunities for individuals to identify and engage in meaningful activity within
  the program.</p>
  <b><p>Strengths and abilities are recognized and developed to enhance independence and
  fulfillment.</p>
  </b><p>The program helps members recognize and build upon their unique strengths and
  abilities.</p>
