    <p><font size="3">Ian Cairns, Chairman&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. Wayne Fyffe, President</font><b></p>
    <p></b></b></font>It is our pleasure to report to the community we serve on the activities
    for the year ending March 31, 1999. The year began with hope for a very bright future for
    the hospital and the community it serves when final Directives to the hospital and advice
    to the Minister of Health on the expansion of the Credit Valley Hospital were issued, by
    the Health Services Restructuring Commission on April 27, 1998. The Board established a
    Building and Planning Sub-Committee. The committee, together with Mr. Ian Sinclair,
    Associate Vice-President, Corporate Planning and Construction and the firm of Agnew
    Peckham Consultants completed a very detailed Functional Program describing the size and
    scope of facilities, required to implement the Directives of the Restructuring Commission
    and the advice to the Minister to establish the Peel Regional Cancer Centre and a Regional
    Child and Maternal Care Centre at the Credit Valley Hospital. It is important to
    acknowledge the tremendous efforts of all hospital and medical staff who contributed to
    this extensive planning exercise, including the Future Initiatives Team put in place to
    oversee the creation of the Functional Program document. After fast-tracking the
    completion of this first step of the planning process, the hospital remained hopeful that
    there would be equally fast approvals from the Ministry of Health. <b><b></p>
    <p></b></b><font size="3">Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year, we were pleased to
    receive approval of $45.4 million ($31.8m from the Ministry of Heath and the balance from
    the community) for the building of the Peel Regional Cancer Centre at the Credit Valley
    Hospital. In addition, we received a letter from The Minister supporting the integration
    of the Centre with expanded Ambulatory Care space. This is indeed good news for our
    community. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Last year's Annual Report also referred to ongoing fiscal constraint and
    the need for sustainable growth funding to ensure that we have the staff and supplies in
    place to serve the increasing demand for service which, in turn, is related to the growing
    population we serve. In order to maintain quality, the Board of Governors approved an
    interim budget which resulted in an increasing deficit each month throughout most of the
    fiscal year.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Fortunately, in December 1998 an injection of $3.5m in one-time
    transitional funding from the Ministry of Health allowed us to end the year with a small
    deficit of less than one half of one percent. Our ability to maintain quality while under
    such fiscal constraint and uncertainty, is a tribute to our physicians and staff who
    worked together with management and the Board to do the best that they could under very
    trying circumstances.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">In cooperation with the Ministry of Health, the hospital established a
    Steering Committee to oversee an External Review of the hospital's finances as it relates
    to the growth of the population it serves. The SteeringCommittee was chaired by the
    Executive Director of the Halton Peel District Health Council with membership including a
    health council member and three representatives each from the Ministry of Health and the
    hospital. The extensive analysis undertaken by the consulting group, HCM with assistance
    from Hay Associates, was nearly complete at the end of the fiscal year. This independent
    objective review of the financial situation at the Credit Valley Hospital contains the
    following highlights and major themes: </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">* the hospital's operations are efficient; </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">* actions are needed to deal with current and projected growth;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">* the hospital's financial position is currently sound, but precarious;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">* clinical and administrative efficiencies have been realized;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">* there are opportunities for operational improvement;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">* and the solution to Emergency Department throughput requires many
    interrelated initiatives. Emergency Department throughput is a symptom of a more systemic
    problem: dealing with the impacts of&nbsp; growth within available capital and operating
    resources.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">It is clear from the above comments that we must continue to work hard
    to ensure there is sustainable growth funding in place for the Credit Valley Hospital and
    that much needed expansion projects are fast-tracked. When the hospital received the
    Directives and read the advice to the Minister of Health concerning major new initiatives
    at the Credit Valley Hospital, it was obvious that we needed to review our Strategic Plan
    and to ensure that we had Vision, Mission and Values Statements that were relevant to our
    future state. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">We are pleased to announce that through an exhaustive process involving
    hundreds of employees, physicians and volunteers, the Board of Governors at its meeting on
    May 27, 1999 approved the new Vision, Mission and Values statements as well as a new
    Strategic Plan to act as a road map for the future of the Credit Valley Hospital. These
    two documents are featured at our Annual General Meeting and in this formal report. We
    encourage you to read them and we assure you that the Board of Governors will work
    diligently in the coming years to follow this overall road map as we implement the
    Restructuring Commission directives. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">There are related groups that we must acknowledge in this Annual Report.
    Hospitals would not be able to run without the extensive contribution intime and money
    from our volunteers. Our CVH Associates are the best!&nbsp; Similarly, it is vital that
    hospitals raise money in order to purchaseequipment and provide capital for expansions.
    Our Credit Valley Hospital Foundation Board of Directors works closely with the hospital
    to ensure your donations are used wisely. Last year was a record year for total funds
    raised by the Foundation. Finally, we thank the citizens of Mississauga andsurrounding
    communities for your ongoing support of the Credit Valley Hospital.</font><b><b>&nbsp; </p>
