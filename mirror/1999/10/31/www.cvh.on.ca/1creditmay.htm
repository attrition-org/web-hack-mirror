<p><em><strong>by Wendy Johnson APR</strong></em></p>

<p>Pregnant moms, premature babies and seriously ill children will benefit from a new
regional program to be located at The Credit Valley Hospital. The development of the South
Peel/Halton Child Health Network is in response to the Health Services Restructuring
Commission's directive to establish a regional perinatal and paediatric network of health
services. The goal of the Child Health Network is to improve the health and quality of
life for children. Patient services will be provided at the highest standard possible.
Independent of geographic location, services will be provided in a consistent and
coordinated manner across the continuum of care. Most importantly to the patients and
their families, their care will be provided as close to home as possible.</p>

<p>The cluster of hospitals in the South Peel/Halton regional network are:</p>

<p>* The Mississauga/Queensway Hospitals, now known as Trillium</p>

<p>* The Credit Valley Hospital</p>

<p>Because The Credit Valley Hospital is the site of the regional program, doesn't mean
the other hospitals won't be doing their share of primary level obstetrics and paediatric
care.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It simply means the higher risk pregnancies, births and paediatric patients will be
transferred, in consultation with their &quot;home&quot; hospital, to The Credit Valley
Hospital, where our professionals will care for them. The professionals at CVH will in
turn, collaborate on the patient's care plan, with the tertiary centres in the Child
Health Network.</p>

<p>The caregivers at the hospitals within the regions of South Peel and Halton, will
become more involved in the continuum of care for their patients. They'll share
educational and sub-specialty resources, outcome management and the ability to define the
direction for high quality care for pregnant women, new mothers, newborns, children and
families.</p>

<p>In all it's a win-win situation for the patients, the caregivers and the hospitals.</p>

<p>The establishment of the program at The Credit Valley Hospital is a tribute to the
hospital's reputation for excellence in quality of care, service and utilization
management. The network of services is known as the Child Health Network. The vision and
strategy was developed by Metro Toronto and the GTA 905 hospitals to provide a more
collaborative network for comprehensive care (see insets entitled, Vision and Values) .
What that means is improved care and services that are closer to home for moms, babies and
children up to age seventeen. Until now, women in high risk pregnancies and children
requiring a sophisticated level of care, would be cared for at tertiary hospitals such as
the Hospital for Sick Children, Mt. Sinai and Women's College Hospital in downtown
Toronto. Even if they were outpatients, they often had to travel several times a week for
treatment in Toronto. The development of the new regional services means many of those
downtown visits will be eliminated. Patients will be able to receive treatment and
follow-up care at The Credit Valley Hospital. CVH will provide secondary care and some
subspecialty services, that until now, have only been available at tertiary hospitals.
This will eliminate costly and time-consuming travel. And it will provide more of a
comfort level for these patients who know specialized care is right in their own
neighborhood.</p>

<p>The establishment of a regional service is better for our health care professionals as
well. We all know that the more experience we have doing a job, the better we become at
it. The regional program will create what is known as a critical mass of patients which
allows our health professionals to develop specialized programs and skills to deal with
patients requiring secondary and some tertiary level services. Our health care
professionals are upgrading their skills to deal with the more sophisticated level of
care.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As well, the tertiary specialists at The Hospital for Sick Children will be consulting
with our professionals to determine the best plan of care for our new patients.</p>

<p>We've already taken on some of our new responsibilities even though official funding
for the project has not been received. In April we opened our Outpatient Paediatric
Medicine Clinic, which serves patients from our catchment areas who have been redirected
to us from the Emergency Department or the General Medicine Clinic at The Hospital for
Sick Children.</p>

<p>Pre-term infants who were delivered at tertiary hospitals will receive the remainder of
their hospital care at CVH. The hospital is also increasing its capacity to deliver
pre-term babies and the referral of high-risk antenatal patients from tertiary hospitals
such as Mt. Sinai Hospital and Women's College Hospital. We'll also establish a high-risk
antenatal clinic for the pregnant mom's assessment and follow-up closer to home. And we'll
be doing more paediatric surgery.</p>

Pharmacy Staff Celebrate Pharmacy Awareness Week</a></strong></font></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><strong><em>By Heather Hadden</em></strong></p>

<p>National Pharmacy Awareness Week was held across Canada March 1-7 1999 and the pharmacy
staff at the Credit Valley Hospital were on hand to help celebrate. This yearly event is
organized by the Canadian Pharmacists Association, the Canadian Society of Hospital
Pharmacists and the Canadian Association of Pharmacy Students and Interns. There are
several purposes to this week: to promote the role of the pharmacist to the community, to
hold a community wide medicine cabinet clean-up and to launch this years theme: &nbsp;
&quot;Taking Your Medicine Well? Talk to Your Pharmacist!&quot;</p>

<p>The medicine cabinet clean-up was publicised to all staff through the office automation
message system each day encouraging them to clean out their medicine cabinets. The
outpatient pharmacy under the supervision of Dennis Cazzin accepted any returned
medication. Signs encouraging the public to do the same were posted and it was advertised
in the Mississauga News.</p>

<p>Unused medications should always be discarded for several reasons:</p>

<p>-outdated medications are often ineffective and some medications are even toxic</p>

<p>-sharing of medications is always discouraged since different people respond to
medications in different ways and may experience different side effects</p>

<p>- if your condition/illness recurs you should see your doctor for reassessment</p>

<p>- eye products are particularly dangerous to keep since the bacteria that was once
present in the eye may grow over time in the vial and reintroducing this into the eyes
could result in a severe infection or blindness</p>

<p>The pharmacists role has changed over the years.&nbsp; Now when a pharmacist gets a
prescription for a drug they will make sure that the drug and dosage is appropriate for
the patients disease/condition. The pharmacist will also make sure that new drugs will not
interact with other drugs that you may already be taking. When talking to the patient the
pharmacist will reaffirm what the drug is for, how it works, side effects that may occur
and how to deal with these side effects, precautions while taking the medication, and
drugs or foods to avoid while on the medication.</p>

<p>The interaction should not stop there- the patient should be encouraged to contact the
pharmacist if any problems arise with their drug therapy.</p>

<p>The pharmacist in conjunction with the patient's physician(s) can very often make
changes so that the patients quality of life is better while taking the medications.</p>

<p>Pharmacists in both the community and hospital setting give special attention to many
groups of patients- the elderly who may be at risk of side effects or especially sensitive
to medications; children; patients on a number of drugs; and patients with kidney or liver
problems that may alter the excretion of drugs. Pharmacists are concerned with the safe
and proper storage of medications which includes a dry cool place out of direct sunlight
and out of the reach of children. Pharmacists will encourage parents to talk to their
children about medications that may be in the house. The children need to know that
medications are not candy.</p>

<p>The pharmacists responsibilty is also to ensure that patients take their medications
exactly as prescribed. They may also give suggestions to simplify medication regimens and
supply hints to remember drug times.</p>

<p>Pharmacists are very interested in education and prevention and assume this role as
well.&nbsp; It is important to know that you should always &quot;Talk To Your
Pharmacist&quot;- not only during Pharmacy Awareness Week but all year around!</p>

<p><img src="May%20Web%20Pic's/Dr.%20Clarkson.gif" alt="Dr. Clarkson" align="left" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="216">The
President and Chief Executive Officer of The Credit Valley Hospital, Wayne Fyffe, on
behalf of the Board of Governors, is pleased to announce the appointment of David
Clarkson, MD, CCFP. MHSc as Chief of Family Medicine. </p>

<p>Dr. Clarkson takes on the leadership of the Family Medicine Department at a time when
family physicians are reconsidering their obligations to the local hospitals (see also
&quot;Family Physicians In Short Supply&quot;). </p>

<p>Fyffe said that &quot;as the hospital takes on the additional complex regional
programs, it is very important that we continue to have a strong family medicine
presence.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Clarkson was born and raised in Mississauga. He began his general practice here in
1972 after obtaining his medical and post-graduate family practice training at the
University of Toronto. He has been a coroner for the Province of Ontario since 1974. </p>

<p>In 1983, Dr. Clarkson returned to the University of Toronto to complete a Master of
Health Science degree program. The epidemiology, public health and management theory
training in that program led to a brief career as a medical officer of health for the
Regional Municipality of Niagara. He found that he missed patient care and so returned to
general practice at The Credit Valley Hospital in 1986. </p>

<p>While at our hospital, Dr. Clarkson has worked in the Emergency Department, chaired the
Utilization Committee, the Ambulatory Care Committee and the Ethics Committee. He has
spoken on behalf of the Foundation and at several clinical conferences produced by The
Credit Valley Hospital. He is a previous secretary of the Department of Family Medicine
and a former member of the Peel District Health Council. </p>

<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="Family Physicians In Short Supply In Hospital">Family
Physicians In Short Supply In Hospital</a></strong></font></p>

<p><em><strong>By Wendy Johnson APR, Director, Community Relations and Communications</strong></em></p>

<p>There&#146;s a problem that&#146;s been simmering among Ontario&#146;s family
physicians for the last few years. It&#146;s a problem that could develop into a crisis at
The Credit Valley Hospital, and other hospitals around the province. It has, and will,
impact the health care of our patients. It has to do with a shortage of family physicians.</p>

<p>Hospital privileges, allow physicians to admit their patients to hospital. They agree
to help, on a rotating basis, those patients who are admitted through the emergency
department who do not have family doctors on staff. But the number of family physicians
able to give their time to these patients is decreasing. &quot;It&#146;s a difficult
problem to deal with,&quot; Dr. David Clarkson, the new Chief of Family Practice at CVH
says.</p>

<p>&quot;When a patient arrives in the Emergency Department, s/he is asked for the name of
his family physician. Often the patient says s/he does not have a family physician. As a
result, the patient is assigned a family physician from among the roster of family
physicians with privileges at The Credit Valley Hospital. This creates a problem for the
family physicians, most of whom, already have a full complement of patients in hospital,
and full practices in their offices.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Clarkson notes as a result, many of the family physicians, both here and across the
province, are relinquishing their hospital privileges. &quot;This further compounds the
problem,&quot; he says, &quot;because then, when one of their patients ends up in the
emergency room, they too are assigned to one of the remaining family physicians with
hospital privileges. This causes an increased patient load for that physician, which in
turn creates the possibility that they too, will decide to relinquish their privileges! It
becomes a vicious circle!&quot;</p>

<p>As the new Chief of Family Medicine, it will be Dr. Clarkson&#146;s challenge to
address this dilemma. &quot;This is not unique to The Credit Valley Hospital,&quot; he
explains. &quot;Most hospitals in the province are struggling to deal with this
situation.&quot;</p>

<p>What can you, as a patient, do to help? &quot;Get your present family physician to join
us here at The Credit Valley Hospital to participate in that important aspect of health
care.&quot; Dr. Clarkson suggests. &quot;Although there is a shortage of family physicians
around the province, there are some who are taking new patients.&quot; A Credit To Your
Health will publish a list of new physicians in this issue, and subsequent issues to help
patients find a family physician. </p>

<p>&quot;You should be able to look on your family physician as the person who can best
assist you through the health care system.&quot; Dr. Clarkson explains. &quot;He or she
looks after you and your family on an ongoing basis. When you require specialist
treatment, he or she will make sure you are referred to the best physician in the field.
When you are in hospital, your physician will meet with you to discuss your care. Your
family physician will also keep in touch with any specialists who may be seeing you while
you are in the hospital.&quot; </p>

<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="FAQs (frequently asked questions) about Anesthetic">FAQs
(frequently asked questions) about Anesthetic</a></strong></font></p>
<b>

<p>Q: What is General Anesthesia?</b></p>

<p>A: During general anesthesia, your anesthesiologist keeps you in a sate of carefully
controlled unconsciousness with a mixture of very potent drugs, so that the operation is
painless. Many people think that this involves the injection of just one drug. Actually,
most general anesthetics require the administration of somewhere between three and 15
different drugs, depending on the complexity of the case.</p>
<b>

<p>Q: What is Regional Anesthesia?</b></p>

<p>A: Regional anesthesia involves injecting local anesthetics through a needles, which
the anesthesiologist places close to the nerve or nerves supplying the region of the body
involved in the operation. The skin and tissues that the needle goes through are also
numbed with local anesthetic so that there is minimal discomfort associated with placement
of the needle. Local anesthetic drugs stop nerves from working temporarily, so that no
sensation and/or movement in the area of the body supplied by the nerve(s) occurs. This
type of anesthesia is also called a nerve block.</p>
<b>

<p>Q: What is Local Anesthesia?</b></p>

<p>A: Local anesthesia refers to temporarily numbing a small area by injecting local
anesthetic into the skin so that minor procedures, like stitching cuts, can be done
painlessly.</p>
<b>

<p>Q: What is an Epidural?</b></p>

<p>A: The epidural space lies just outside the special covering or dura, which encloses
the spinal cord and nerves. An epidural is a type of regional anesthetic in which a needle
is positioned between the bones of the spine to allow the anesthesiologist to insert a
small plastic tube (or catheter( into the epidural space. The needle is then removed and
local anesthetic is injected through the catheter. </p>
<b>

<p>Q: What is a Spinal?</b></p>

<p>A: In a spinal anesthetic, a very thin needles is inserted between the bones of the
lumbar spine, through the dura and into the spinal fluid. A small amount of local
anesthetic is injected, which quickly stops the spinal nerves from working, so that there
is no movement or sensation below that level of the body. The effect is temporary, lasting
only until the local anesthetic wears off.</p>
<b>

<p>Q: Why Can&#146;t I Eat or Drink Before Surgery?</b></p>

<p>A: Inhaling vomited stomach contents into your lungs is called aspiration and can be
dangerous. Fortunately your body has an effective mechanism to stop this from happening.
Unfortunately when you are unconscious this mechanism does not work, so it&#146;s best
that your stomach is empty when you have a general anesthetic. In emergency surgery when
you may have eaten recently, your anesthesiologist will take special precautions to reduce
the risk of aspiration. Even if you are booked to have a regional anesthetic, it is
important to follow the instructions about not eating and drinking, just in case it
becomes necessary for your to have a general anesthetic.</p>
<b>

<p>Q: What if I&#146;m Allergic to Anesthesia?</b></p>

<p>A: Sometimes patients may think, or be told, that they are &quot;allergic to
anesthesia&quot; because they have an unpleasant experience that they associate with
anesthesia, for example nausea and vomiting. These are side effects of drug
administration, not allergic reactions. A true allergic reaction to a drug usually
produces hives or wheals on the skin, wheezing in the lungs, swelling of the mouth, throat
or eyes, and sometimes a drop in blood pressure.</p>

<p>I just received a telephone call from Heather Wood Bennett, Co-ordinator for Children's
Bridge, an international Adoption Agency. They had a function in our Auditorium this past
Saturday, for which a major setup was required as well as AV equipment. She wanted to let
us know that the service provided was OUTSTANDING!! When the number of chairs was running
low, the Environmental Crew quickly responded to the need. Tim Chevrier was very organized
and the Hospital staff were so very welcoming!!</p>

<p>Dharam came into the predialysis / transplant office today. He had the biggest smile on
his face. He looked like a kid who had just experienced ten Christmases rolled into one.
&quot;Well?&quot; I asked him, &quot;How are you feeling?&quot; He looked at me, his voice
almost choking with emotion, &quot; I feel great, I feel just great!&quot; You see, Dharam
had just received a special gift. Dharam recently underwent a kidney transplant. A kidney
transplant for Dharam meant a new lease on life, &quot; I noticed a big change in my
health the next day after transplant; I feel so much better,&quot; he repeated. It was
almost as if he still could not believe that the transplant had finally happened.</p>

<p>Dharam was one of the lucky ones; he waited for just over 3 years before receiving his
transplant. The average waiting time is four years. For Dharam, three years of an
emotional roller coaster waiting for the phone call from the transplant hospital telling
him that a kidney had become available, was over.</p>

<p>Patients awaiting a kidney transplant must receive life support treatment which may
consist of either peritoneal dialysis or hemo dialysis. Dharam was educated on both
dialysis type options and in consultation with his multidisciplinary medical team decided
that peritoneal dialysis, a self care treatment at home, best suited his life style.
Dialysis maintained Dharam&#146;s health until a kidney transplant became available.</p>

<p>Dharam and I sat down and reflected on the past 3 years. I first met Dharam in the
emergency department of the Credit Valley Hospital. He had just been diagnosed with
chronic kidney failure and was apprehensive about how he would cope with this new
challenge. Dharam had overcome many obstacles in his life; he was born with no legs.
Dharam worked at the &#145;Home Depot&#146; and was worried about fitting dialysis around
his work. As it turned out, he need not have worried<i>. </i>&quot;When they knew I was on
dialysis, I explained the restrictions of time and they were very flexible with my part
time hours, they were great,&quot; said Dharam.<i> </i>&quot;The staff at the Credit
Valley Hospital were also great, they were always there for me, helping me along the
way&quot;. </p>

<p>The Credit Valley Hospital is a regional dialysis centre servicing the needs of people
in the Peel and Halton community. The renal division consists of three programs:
pre-dialysis, peritoneal and hemodialysis. The pre-dialysis program focuses on education
and monitoring patients until the need for dialysis arises. At present there are 170
patients followed in this program. Patients are taught about the different types of
dialysis, transplantation, blood pressure monitoring/hypertension. They are also taught
the importance of taking their medication properly and diet counseling.</p>

<p>Community support is available through the Kidney Foundation sponsored &quot;Renal
Education and Peer Support Group (West).&quot; This group meets monthly at the Mississauga
Central Library.</p>

<p>The Peritoneal Dialysis Program teaches patients to manage their dialysis at home
safely. Very often it is a lifestyle decision as to why this type of dialysis is chosen.
There are 100 patients on peritoneal dialysis at The Credit Valley Hospital.</p>

<p>Hemodialysis at The Credit Valley Hospital has seen tremendous growth; expansion has
occurred in the hospital and to three Satellite Units: Head Waters Health Care Centre in
Orangeville; Peel Memorial Hospital in Brampton; and the Self-Care Sussex Centre in
Mississauga. Despite the increases in dialysis facilities the need for further expansion
continues. This increased need for dialysis has occurred due to more prevalence of
diabetes and demographic shifts towards an older population. </p>

<p>The Hemodialysis Unit operates forty dialysis machines and three patients are dialyzed
on each machine per day, therefore, 120 patients are dialyzed each day. Approximately, 250
patients receive treatment, which consists of each patient coming to the hospital for four
hour treatments, three times a week.</p>

<p>Good health is maintained with a special diet, numerous medications and dialysis. A
multidisciplinary team consisting of professionals such as nurses, dieticians, social
workers, pharmacists and nephrologists work closely with the patient to enable him/her to
manage their disease.</p>

<p>Although transplants are not performed at The Credit Valley Hospital, the hospital has
an active transplant program that prepares patients for transplant and monitors the stable
transplanted patents. At present, there are 140 patients being assessed or waiting for a
kidney transplant. </p>

<p>Also, 85 patients who have had a transplant are followed in the transplant clinic.</p>

<p>Canada has the worst record for organ donation in the world, transplant lists are
bigger and this means that the waiting time for a transplant is longer. Every one should
discuss organ donation with their family because it is the family decision and not the
signed organ donor card that determines organ donation.</p>

<p>The Credit Valley Hospital Renal Program pioneered pre-dialysis education and is a
resource for newer programs. The Hemodialysis Unit is one of the largest centers in
Ontario and the Peritoneal Dialysis Unit has won awards for excellence in care.</p>

<p>We are very proud of the many professionals who make up the multidisciplinary renal
team, who constantly strive to provide the best possible care for our community.</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="May is Speech and Hearing Awareness Month">May is
Speech and Hearing Awareness Month</a></strong></font></p>

<p><em><strong>by Suzanne Hamilton, Speech-Language Pathologist</strong></em></p>

<p>The month of May has been chosen by speech-language pathologists and audiologists as a
time to raise public awareness of speech, language, swallowing and hearing disorders that
affect millions of Canadians.</p>

<p>Speech-language pathologists identify and treat all types of communication and
swallowing disorders while audiologists test hearing and recommend hearing aids as
appropriate. CVH&#146;s speech and audiology department sees children and adults, both
inpatients at the hospital and clients from the community. As part of this year&#146;s
Speech and Hearing month, we would like to share some frequently asked questions and
answers about communication, swallowing and hearing loss. If you would like more
information, or suspect a hearing, speech, language or swallowing problem, please contact
an audiologist or speech-language pathologist, or call the Ontario Association of
Speech-Language Pathologists and Audiologists at (416) 920-3676.</p>
<b>

<p>Q: My mother recently had a stroke and now has &quot;aphasia&quot;. She can say only a
few words, but seems to understand everything. Is that common?</b></p>

<p>A: Aphasia is a language disorder that results in difficulty speaking and/or
understanding language (spoken and written), and is caused by damage to the brain. Some
individuals may find it easier to understand language than to express themselves. A
speech-language pathologist can work with your mother and your family to provide
intervention and strategies that help make communication easier.</p>
<b>

<p>Q: How much do hearing aids cost?</b></p>

<p>A: Hearing aids range in price depending upon the size of the aid. The smaller the size
(and the more advanced the technology and circuit has to be), the higher the cost. The
general price range is from $750 to $2000 for one hearing aid. There is a government
&quot;Assistive Devices Program&quot; (ADP) that may subsidize 75% of the cost, up to a
maximum of $500.00 per hearing aid.</p>
<b>

<p>Q: If my child is two years old, what kind of speech should he or she be using?</b></p>

<p>A: By two years of age, the average child is using two word phrases (e.g. &quot;more
milk&quot;), can say at least 20 different words, and consistently uses the sounds i, o,
u, p, b, m, n and d. A two-year-old can usually understand simple questions, bring you one
object on command, and point to some body parts. The Credit Valley Hospital is a partner
in the Peel Preschool Speech and Language Services program that provides communication
assessment and intervention for preschoolers. If you would like more information, please
call 820-7111, extension 2355.</p>
<b>

<p>Q: My father is 75 years old and seems to choke frequently while eating or drinking. Is
this a swallowing problem?</b></p>

<p>A: The fact that you have observed repeated difficulty with eating and drinking is a
sign of a possible swallowing problem. Swallowing difficulties (also called dysphagia) can
occur at any age, and may have a neurological origin. A speech-language pathologist can
assess whether or not there is a swallowing problem and provide management strategies. A
referral for a swallowing assessment can be made through your family doctor.</p>
<b>

<p>Q: When you lose your voice as a result of a cold, is it better to whisper or to try to
talk &quot;raspy&quot; (i.e. use your voice as it is?)</p>
</b>

<p>A: It is often best to use your voice the way it is rather than whispering when you
have a cold. When we whisper, only one part of the vocal folds is used. This may result in
stress to the vocal folds and may worsen your vocal quality. It is also important,
however, not to OVERUSE your voice while you have a cold, and even more important not to
ABUSE your voice (i.e. by yelling, using a loud voice or excessively clearing your throat)
when you have a cold or at any time.</p>
<b>

<p>Q: My daughter will be three in June. She often says part of a sentence, then gets
stuck on one word (e.g. Mommy, I want my b-b-b-ball&quot;). Will she grow out of this?
What can I do to help her?</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A: Some preschool children go through a period of time when their
speech is not as fluent and they have a hard time &quot;getting the words out&quot;, often
as language is developing rapidly. We recommend that you consult with a speech-language
pathologist who can evaluate your child&#146;s speech and language. The following
suggestions may also be helpful: </p>

<ol TYPE="a">
  <li>Model a slow, relaxed manner of talking; </li>
  <li>Use short simple sentences and vocabulary that is at your child&#146;s level; </li>
  <li>Use more comments and descriptors rather than a lot of questions; </li>
  <li>Look at your child when he or she is talking to you; and </li>
  <li>Pay attention to what your child says rather than how he or she is saying it.</li>
</ol>

<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="Memoirs of a Community Representative Officer">Memoirs
of a Community Representative Officer</a></strong></font></p>

<p><em><strong>by Helen Reilly, PR Specialist</strong></em></p>

<p>As she hung up her hospital-issue jacket for the last time, her moniker -- &quot;the
face of Credit Valley&quot; -- was retired as well. It's literally been twelve years on
the front line at The Credit Valley Hospital for Sylvia Polachuk.</p>

<p>In 1989, Sylvia assumed the role of Community Representative Officer (CRO) and became a
fixture in the hospital's main lobby. She was especially recognizable by the red coat she
donned each morning along with a smile ready to cope with whatever the day had to offer.</p>

<p><img src="May%20Web%20Pic's/Sylvia%20Polachuk.gif" alt="Sylvia Polachuk" align="left" WIDTH="232" HEIGHT="252">Among
her duties, Sylvia was responsible not only for the pleasantries of welcoming patients but
also for dealing with the logistics involved in a hospital fire drill or alarm, code for a
missing patient, and orchestrating preparations for helicopter transport of a patient.</p>

<p>Acting as a resource, providing direction and instruction where necessary, she was
responsible for ensuring babies making the first trip home were packed into their car
seats properly - and never hesitated to remind mom and dad to pack themselves in safely as
well. </p>

<p>She also became familiar with many of the &quot;regulars&quot; - such as patients
arriving by wheel-trans for outpatient treatment in the hospital's busy renal dialysis
unit.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know all the names, but I knew the faces,&quot; says Sylvia of the many
patients she came to know over the years. &quot;I really enjoyed my job; I never knew what
to expect each day - I never knew what would come through the front door.&quot;</p>

<p>Among her memories, Sylvia recalls the early days when she brought her pet poodle
Tiffany into the hospital to visit patients. &quot;Tiffany had a tremendous effect on many
of the patients. In fact, one gentleman became so close to her that he requested a picture
of Tiffany be buried with him when he finally succumbed to his illness,&quot; Sylvia
recalls warmly.</p>

<p>Once, several years ago, Sylvia approached a weeping woman in the hospital's main
lobby. While Sylvia did only what came naturally to her, she had no idea what impact her
gesture would have on this person's life. It was only years later that a happier looking
woman approached Sylvia to thank her for sharing her time and a hug with a total stranger
&#150; a hug that helped convince the woman her consideration of suicide was perhaps not
the only available option - someone cared about her.</p>

<p>Having no regrets about moving to London with her husband following his employment
transfer, Sylvia admits she will miss the day-to-day interaction with the people she came
to know as friends. &quot;I am looking forward to the change of pace and travelling a
little more with my husband in our recreational vehicle, but I'll miss the work and the
people,&quot; she says.</p>

<p>The hospital's new CRO, Gary Sarina realizes Sylvia's going to be a tough act to
follow. He's anxious to make the acquaintance of many of those who held Sylvia's
friendship so dear. Gary looks forward to the challenge and excitement each day has to
offer.</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="Michael's Story:&nbsp; Recognizing the Special Needs of Those Persons with Brain Injuries">Michael's
Story:&nbsp; Recognizing the Special Needs of Those Persons with Brain Injuries</a></strong></font></p>

<p>He's young but he's old. He's full of things to say, but unable to say them. He wants
to move, to experience life, like any young person his age, but his world of mobility has
been cut off.</p>

<p>This is Michael's story --the story of a young man whose life has been permanently
altered as a result of a motor vehicle accident which left him with a severe brain injury.
He needs constant care. His communication is limited and as a result he often exhibits
agitated behaviours such as screaming. He is frustrated to say the least. And this has
frustrated his caregivers at The Credit Valley Hospital and often upsets other patients.
Michael lives on the Continuing Care Unit, a unit designed for the frail elderly. But it
is the only unit that provides the type of extensive nursing and physical care Michael
requires.</p>

<p>The multidisciplinary team has been working diligently to find a solution that will be
beneficial to Michael. Since he is very limited in the range of activities that he can
sustain on his own, providing him with an appropriate level of stimulation has been
challenging as has been the task of maintaining a high level of consistency in responding
to his disruptive behaviours.</p>

<p>But help may be on the horizon. One of the hospitals' social workers contacted the Peel
Halton Acquired Brain Injury Services (PHABIS) and together the multidisciplinary team and
staff at PHABIS developed a proposal which was subsequently accepted for funding by the
Long Term Care Ministry. A grant of $90,000 was given to PHABIS for the purpose of
providing care to Michael.</p>

<p>As a result, PHABIS hired a behaviour therapist to work on a one to one basis with
Michael. A therapist is available seven days a week to help CVH health professionals
replace Michael's agitated behaviours with more adaptive ones.</p>

<p>In addition, Michael will have access to the modular services, such as a music group
and peer support group, which are already available in the community for the brain
injured.</p>

<p>The behaviour therapist has become part of the hospital's multidisciplinary team
providing Michael's care. The hospital's psychologist provides direct supervision for the
clinical aspects of Michael's care while the administrative responsibility and
participation in the community program is the responsibility of Peel Halton Acquired Brain
Injury Services.</p>

<p>Michael's program will be funded to the end of his stay in the hospital and PHABIS has
been awarded funds to create a community home for those with similar severe disabilities.
We anticipate that there will be a place available for Michael when this home has been
established</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="Mommy I Bumped My Head and Other Childhood Malaises!">Mommy
I Bumped My Head and Other Childhood Malaises!</a></strong></font></p>

<p>Head injuries, tummy aches, and bites were the topics of conversation at The Credit
Valley Hospital&#146;s Community Education Night recently. Lots of parents showed up with
lots of questions for paediatrician, Dr. Donna Goldenberg, staff paediatrician, and Dr.
Eric Letovsky, Chief of the Emergency Department. The pair gave a lively presentation
interspersed with questions from anxious parents who were more than willing to share their
children&#146;s experiences from such interesting injuries as dog and people bites;
high-flying spills from monkey bars and terrible tummy aches. There was a wealth of
information that we thought you&#146;d find information and useful so we&#146;re going to
summarize some of it for you. But perhaps the most important piece of advice was, <b>always
take your child to the emergency department if you&#146;re worried about any kind of
injury or illness. </p>

<p>What You Should Know About Children&#146;s Head Injuries</b></p>

<p>A child learning to walk may tumble and bump his head. Usually this type of fall
isn&#146;t as significant as one from a greater height (such as falls from a change
table). <b>HINT:</b> To avoid a fall from a change table, make sure you keep one hand on
baby&#146;s tummy whenever you take your eyes from him or when you&#146;re reaching for
something.&nbsp; <b>HINT:</b> Use ice to prevent or diminish swelling. Wrap ice in a
towel, never put ice directly on skin.</p>
<b>

<p>Loss of Consciousness</b> &#150; the longer the length of unconsciousness, the more we
worry.&nbsp; Most kids, even after a minor head injury, will vomit, usually within 30
minutes. Sometimes it&#146;s simply because of the stress of the injury. If the vomiting
persists, if the child is lethargic or you feel he&#146;s &quot;just not quite right&quot;
(confused, disoriented, not as alert) you should bring him into the Emergency Department.</p>
<b>

<p>What Will Happen in the Emergency Department</b></p>

<p>The doctor will feel the child&#146;s scalp to determine if there is a skull fracture.
&nbsp; The doctor will do a neurological examination (eyes, reflexes, strength, steadiness
of walk etc.).&nbsp; NOTE: The majority of children with head injuries can be sent home as
long as parents keep a watchful eye on their child. If the child has a persistent headache
and/or vomiting, you should return to hospital.</p>
<b>

<p>Vomiting and Diarrhea</b></p>

<p>Usually parents biggest concern is that their child will become dehydrated. Often after
a child vomits, he says he&#146;s thirsty. Mom or dad gives him something to
drink&#133;the child guzzles the drink and then he vomits again! <b>HINT:</b> Give your
child Gastrolyte, or Paedialyte to drink. It doesn&#146;t taste that good, so the child
will only take small drinks. This will diminish vomiting. DO NOT give your child
over-the-counter medications to stop diarrhea. These will stop the body from getting rid
of infection.</p>
<b>

<p>Your Child is NOT Dehydrated if:</b></p>

<p>If you can see a shiny reflection in his eyes (sunken and dull eyes are a sign of
dehydration).</p>

<p>If your child has tears when s/he cries.</p>

<p>If your child has the usual number of wet diapers.</p>

<p>If his mouth is moist when you stick your finger in it. </p>

<p>Call your doctor or go to the hospital if:</p>

<p>You child has diarrhea and is less than six months of age.</p>

<p>Your child has bloody or black stools.</p>

<p>Your child starts to vomit and is still vomiting after four to six hours.</p>

<p>Your child has a fever (temperature greater than 38.5 C (101.5 F).</p>
<b>

<p>Tummy Aches</b></p>

<p>There are many reasons for tummay aches in kids. The following two are often difficult
to diagnose: 

<ol>
  <li>Appendicitis</li>
  <li>Constipation</li>
</ol>

<p>Appendicitis is the inflammation of the appendix in the right lower side of the
abdomen, although the pain may not begin there. The tummy ache will get progressively
worse. It WILL NOT ease. It may be accompanied by a fever. The only treatment is surgery.</p>

<p>Pain from constipation is intermittent. It comes and goes. The bowel contracts in order
to empty. When it does not empty, it cramps, but the pain will go away after about fifteen
minutes. In order to avoid constipation, give your child prune juice, lots of vegetables
and vary his diet so that he does not eat the same foods every day. If the pain is so
severe that you bring him to the Emergency Department, an enema may be given.</p>
<b>

<p>Bites</b></p>

<p>Cat, dog and human bites are quite common. It is rare that the bite is deep enough to
injure the tendon. The major concern is risk of infection. </p>

<p>Cats&#146; teeth make small puncture wounds which are very difficult to clean so the
risk of infection in high. If a child is bitten by a cat, the doctor will usually give him
antibiotics to prevent infection.</p>

<p>Dogs&#146; teeth make a more sheering type of wound. Because the wound is larger and
more gaping it is easier to clean. The doctor will irrigate the wound with salt water and
cut off any loose skin that&#146;s around the wound. The doctor will probably not
prescribe antibiotics when the bite is on the face or the hands. </p>

<p>If a child is bitten by another child or adult, there is a serious risk of infection.
Humans carry many more bacteria in their mouths than either cats or dogs. The doctor will
probably not suture the wound because the wound tends to get infected if it is closed. The
doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics. </p>
<b>

<p>HINT:</b> Remember to get a tetanus shot every ten years.</p>

<p>Watch for more helpful hints in upcoming issues of &quot;A Credit to Your Health&quot;.</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="Health System Integration Initiative Approved">Health
System Integration Initiative Approved</a></strong></font></p>

<p>Patients suffering from disabling medical conditions such as stroke or as a result of
injury, work very hard with their hospital caregivers to regain the use of their limbs.
Once they reach a certain level of functioning they are able to return home. As delighted
as they are to be back in their own surroundings, they may lose some of the skills they've
relearned because of lack of professional support and encouragement. But that's about to
change as a result of a new initiative that began with a meeting of community groups
including The Credit Valley Hospital, Trillium and the Halton Health Care Services
Corporation as well as representatives from the Peel Continuing Care Access Centre, Peel
Public Health, South Common Community Centre, The City of Mississauga Parks and Recreation
Department. Although each of these agencies provides a service their goal was to integrate
resources to provide a seamless &quot;continuum of services&quot; for these individuals.
The groups' focus is on wellness and the efficient use of all resources available to the
patients, inside hospital and in the community.</p>

<p>A program was developed that integrates Credit Valley Hospital Rehabilitation and
Seniors Day Program with services provided by the Continuing Care Access Centre and
Mississauga Parks and Recreation. The program helps patients move from the therapeutic
environment of the hospital program to community based services to allow them to build on
the gains they made in therapy as well as to develop the skills and confidence to ensure
continued independence. The Continuing Care Access Centre is exploring opportunities for
providing follow-up services.</p>

<p>There are four phases of the program. Phase one is the hospital treatment phase (Phase
I) where the patients receive occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy,
recreational therapy, nursing and social work services as well as on going medical
consultations from a geriatrician. While in hospital the patients also make use of other
hospital services such as laboratory, imaging and diabetic education.</p>

<p>During Phase II the individual will receive therapies less frequently and will start
the community program which will help them to use the skills they re-acquired during
therapy. This part of Phase II will take place at the South Common Community Centre.
During this transitional phase, the hospital rehabilitation staff will share their
expertise with the community recreational staff and volunteers so that the program can be
adapted to the specialized needs of the individuals. These persons are not &quot;on their
own&quot; to continue to build skills and stamina but receive appropriate help and
guidance in their efforts to resume pre-illness activities and to learn new ones. This is
what's known as &quot;continuity of care&quot;. It's a cost-effective and efficient use of
hospital and community resource and results in the best outcomes for the participants..</p>

<p>The third phase focuses on health and wellness and independent re-integration of the
individual into community activities. The professionals monitor how the individual is
functioning through a variety of recreation, exercise and social activities tailored to
the needs of the participants. The Community Care Access Centre will also refer
appropriate clients to this phase of the program. Caregiver support and relief will be a
key element and activities will be developed specifically for caregivers. In addition,
education will be a significant component of all aspects of this program. Initially,
education will be individualized and will focus on medical and functional concerns.</p>

<p>During the transition period (Phase II) and in the community portion (Phase III),
educational opportunities will be more broadly based and will include sessions on topics
such as osteoporosis, arthritis and stroke, as well as stress management, drug
interactions, and use of sleep enhancement strategies. The educational initiatives will
target both patients and their families.</p>

<p>The Community Care Access Centre and Senior Day Hospital have been developing common
systems to improve information sharing and to establish common outcome measures to make
sure the professionals and the participants are achieving their goals.</p>

<p>The program is being funded by the Long Term Care Division by the Recreation Analyst
for Seniors Programs of the City of Mississauga Parks and Recreation Services. The program
will cost $62,476 which will pay for a program coordinator to plan, implement and evaluate
the program and develop a strong student training and volunteer component. In addition,
the services of a recreation therapist and an exercise counselor will be required. The
program will begin in the Fall, 1999.</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="Peel Regional Cancer Centre Receives Funding">Peel
Regional Cancer Centre Receives Funding</a></strong></font></p>

<p><em><strong>By Wendy Johnson APR, Director, Community Relations and Communications</strong></em></p>

<p>It&#146;s official. Funding for The Peel Regional Cancer Centre has been announced and
the promise of additional funding for an adjoining ambulatory care expansion has been
received. </p>

<p>Rob Sampson, the MPP for Mississauga West, announced the $31.8 million from the
Ministry of Health just minutes before his boss, Premier Mike Harris, called the
provincial election. The total cost of the Cancer Centre is estimated at $45.4 million.
The Ministry&#146;s portion is approximately 70 percent of the total cost. The remainder
will be raised in the community and through the Region of Peel development funds. </p>

<p>The new centre will provide radiation therapy for patients who currently travel to
downtown Toronto or Hamilton for their treatment. The Centre will open with three
radiation treatment machines. Space for an additional three radiation machines will be
provided in recognition of the continuing growth in the region. </p>

<p>Wayne Fyffe, the President of The Credit Valley Hospital says its important that
patients are able to access this type of care closer to home. &quot;We are extremely
pleased the Ministry has responded with the appropriate funding for the Cancer Centre. We
will work closely with Cancer Care Ontario to integrate our operation with that of the new
regional cancer centre.&quot; </p>

<p>Mr. Fyffe added how pleased he was to see &quot;that the Ministry recognized the
importance of funding not only the cancer centre, but the support services, such as
laboratory and diagnostic imaging that will be impacted by the increased patient
load.&quot; The Ministry allotted $14 million more than originally estimated by the Health
Services Restructuing Commission to upgrade the support services.</p>

<p>The building housing the cancer centre will be integrated with expanded ambulatory care
program space for renal dialysis and other medical and surgical services which will
free-up much needed inpatient space in the existing hospital. Fyffe says he anticipates a
funding announcement for that portion of the project soon, in order that the architectural
drawings can be developed in unison with the cancer project. </p>

<p>The Credit Valley Hospital has a registered nursing (RN) staff, complemented by
registered practical nurses (RPN) in our continuing care facility, which is unique in
being able to provide complex health care from a holistic and wellness perspective. As
patient advocates, nurses are key in organizing the best quality of care possible along
the continuum from birth to death. Through education, networking, research and a team
approach, nurses are prepared to care for the patient and family unit in a variable
environment.</p>

<p>Our professional nursing staff function in many enhanced roles such as unit
coordinating nurse, clinical cacilitators, preceptors and various resource nurse roles.</p>

<p>This year, Nursing Week was celebrated from May 10-16, 1999, and the national theme was
&quot;Partners in Healthy Aging&quot;. </p>

<p>Activities during the week included a variety of lectures covering topics such as skin
care, joint replacement and mental health issues related to aging. A major highlight of
the week is the presentation of the Annual Excellence in Nursing Practice Award. The
Excellence in Nursing Practice Award is bestowed on individuals, working in staff nurse
roles, who exemplify the philosophy of the nursing division. This year nurses were
nominated by their peers, in recognition of their contributions to the nursing profession,
through demonstrable excellence in clinical practice, education, leadership and quality
initiatives. The 1999 Excellence in Nursing Award was presented to Debbie Berube, Maternal
Child Services. Honoured nominees were Madoline Baluca, 1E; Sheryl Brimley, 3C; Carolyn

<p><em><strong>By Wendy Johnson APR, Director, Community Relations and Communications</strong></em></p>

<p>The road to health care at The Credit Valley Hospital has some dangerous curves ahead
according to the hospital&#146;s year end statistics and future year projections. The
hospital&#146;s operating volumes have increased dramatically in many programs and
services. Unfortunately, the hospital&#146;s operating funds as provided by the Ministry
of Health, have not kept pace with the growth. </p>

<p>The lack of an appropriate funding formula as it relates to growth was the subject of
much debate during last November&#146;s Kyle Martyn inquest. One of the recommendations
from the inquest, was that the hospital and the Ministry embark on an external review of
the hospital&#146;s funding in order to develop a funding formula that takes into account
the precedent-setting growth in the northwest section of Mississauga. The larger area
served by CVH grew by 48% over the last five years. An additional 32% in growth is
expected between now and the year 2003. The external review was undertaken over the last
few months.</p>

<p>That kind of growth, though felt in every part of the hospital, has been most evident
in the Emergency Department where patients arrive unexpectedly with anything from broken
bones to deadly viruses. The seriousness of patients&#146; conditions (acuity) has
increased dramatically over the last few years. As a result, many of the emergency
patients require admission to hospital. But the nursing units have few, if any, inpatient
beds to spare. The lack of operating funds to provide the additional tests and drugs to
care for the increasing patient load, coupled with the lack of capital funds to expand our
inpatient space to add more beds, has pushed the hospital and its caregivers to the limit.
Too often emergency patients end up waiting on stretchers in that department until a bed
can be found on a nursing unit. </p>

<p>Over the last year patients spent a total of 1977 days in the emergency department
waiting for an inpatient bed. With only 365 days in a year, the statistic indicates how
serious a lack of inpatient resources poses for the emergency department. Based on current
population data, the hospital estimates patients could spend the equivalent of 3000
patient days waiting in the ER for an inpatient bed this year. </p>

<p>At the end of April the hospital received its initial Ministry of Health allocation for
this fiscal year. &quot;It was disappointing to say the least,&quot; hospital president,
Wayne Fyffe acknowledged. &quot;The interim allocation provides $1 million less than last
year&#146;s funding.&quot;</p>

<p>The 1998/99 operating budget, after additional transitional funding injections, was $83
million. The initial funding for the 1999/00 fiscal year will provide a budget of $82
million. The hospital says it needs an operating budget of $104 million. That means the
current funding from the Ministry of Health fall short by $22 million. </p>

<p>Hospital Board Chair, Ian Cairns said he&#146;s &quot;concerned about the erosion of
The Credit Valley Hospital&#146;s capital funds. This money is to help fund capital
projects such as the impending regional cancer centre and ambulatory care addition. We are
dipping into those funds just to meet our budgetary obligations each month. Not only is
that not smart business, it&#146;s dangerous business because by doing so, we are
threatening the future of those capital projects that we must complete in order to meet
our patients needs.&quot; </p>

<p>Both Cairns and Fyffe are hopeful that the external review of the hospital&#146;s
current and projected operation will result in much needed growth funding so the hospital
can continue to meet the demands of our patients. The final report of the external review
committee is expected within the next few weeks.</p>

will the Cancer Centre open? I am asked this question regularly. </p>

<p>All hospitals in Ontario must have prior approval of the Ministry of Health before
building additions. The first step is to receive approval of a comprehensive planning
document called a &quot;Functional Program&quot;! It details the size and scope of the
proposed programs and buildings, and provides a cost estimate.</p>

<p>On May 5, 1999 we received approval of the Functional Program for the Peel Regional
Cancer Centre at an estimated total cost of $45.4 million. We are delighted because the
approval includes initial installation of three radiation therapy machines plus three more
rooms to be built so that we can easily install three more machines as the need increases
within the rapidly growing population of the Peel Region and surrounding areas.</p>

<p>Now we are seeking approval to integrate this new building with desperately needed
ambulatory care (outpatient) space. This integration will save construction costs and
annual operating costs.</p>

<p>What&#146;s next? When we receive approval of the Ambulatory Care Functional Program,
we can ask our architects to prepare design drawings for the integrated facility. Then we
will provide detailed specifications for each room. Then we will develop a construction
tender document. When the construction contract is awarded to the successful bidder, we
can put a hole in the ground.</p>

<p>Whew! Planning is hard work. Led by Ian Sinclair, Associate Vice President, Corporate
Planning and Construction, teams of CVH staff, physicians, Cancer Care Ontario staff and
architects have been busy visiting other cancer centres and ambulatory care centres so
that we can observe the best design ideas. I am confident that when the Peel Regional
Cancer Centre opens at the end of 2001, it will be the finest centre in Canada!</p>

<p>The integrated Cancer Care/Ambulatory Care Centre is our first priority. Many other
important expansion projects are also awaiting approval of the Functional Program &#150;
eg. Child and Maternal Care, Mental Health, Rehabilitation, Complex Continuing Care,
Surgery and other related programs.</p>

<p>We will continue to work with Ministry staff to fast track approvals and construction,
and to ensure that our new facilities are large enough in size and scope of service to
allow us to offer you &quot;care closer to home&quot;. </p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

Just Put You To Sleep!</a></strong></font></p>

<p>Most people, when they hear the term anaesthetist, or anesthesiologist, think of a
person who puts patients to sleep before an operation. Well, they do that&#133;but they do
a lot more.</p>

<p>Dr. George Dyke is the Chief of Anesthesiology at The Credit Valley Hospital. He and
his fellow anesthesiologists took time from their busy schedules, April 28<sup>th</sup> to
set up a public display and speak to patients and visitors at the hospital about the work
they do. Dr. Dyke explained that Canadian anesthesiologists are specialist physicians in
peri-operative medicine, critical care and pain management. They see patients through
their most critical times in many areas of the hospital, not just the operating room. One
of the most important discussions an anesthesiologist has with a patient is prior to
surgery when s/he will discuss the risks, the benefits and safety issues in connection
with the anaesthesia we&#146;ll administer in the operating room. &quot;We see up to 20%
of our patients in the Preoperative Assessment Clinic to determine potential problems,
treat them preoperatively and reassure the patients about the process.&quot; </p>

<p>He says most patients are anaesthetized intravenously. &quot;Occasionally we use a mask
with patients who are uncomfortable with needles. An EMLA patch &#150; a local anesthetic
ointment &#150; can reduce the pain of the needle injection. We often advise parents to
purchase these prior to their child&#146;s operation. Another form of anaesthetic is the
epidural/regional analgesia. This &quot;freezes&quot; the part of the body we are
operating on but allows the patient to remain awake during surgery.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We&#146;re in the operating room watching over the patients, keeping them safe
and comfortable during surgery,&quot; Dr. Dyke said. &quot;But we&#146;re also there after
the operation, to keep patients free of pain as they recover from the anesthesia and the
surgery. Sometimes we recommend a pain pump or &#145;patient controlled analgesia&#146;
for our patients after surgery. This allows them to monitor their pain and give themselves
a shot of pain killer through their intravenous line, when they feel pain.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Dyke also noted that the Canadian Anaesthetists&#146; Society has changed its name
to the Canadian Anesthesiologists&#146; Society. &quot;This is to avoid any confusion with
the term anaesthetist, which is used by nurse anaethetists in the United States. The term
anaesthesiologist is a better reflection of the North American nomenclature and the
broader technical scope of the specialty. &quot;The term is also in keeping with other
specialists such as gastroenterologist and endocrinologist,&quot; Dr. Dyke explained. </p>

<p>Dr. Dyke and his fellow anesthesiologists hope that by providing information about
anesthesia and anesthesiologists they can offer a high level of psychological comfort to
patients facing surgery and to those patients&#146; families and friends. Information
about the Canadian Anesthesiologists&#146; Society is available on the web at <a HREF="http://www.cas.ca/">www.cas.ca</a>.</p>
