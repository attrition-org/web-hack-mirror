<p><i>With spring and summer come warm weather, humidity and, of course, those pesky
insects. Here are some tips on taking the itch and sting out of your outdoor adventures:</i></p>

<p>The swelling, redness, and itchiness associated with stings and bites is the body's
natural allergic response to the substance excreted into a bite by the insect. Avoiding
insect bites is better than having to treat them; however, with heat and humidity, it is
very likely that we will be bitten by bugs.</p>

<p>There are some ways we can minimize being stung. Avoid areas which have high
populations of bugs (woods, marshes, clover fields, gardens, etc.) Do not wear brightly
coloured clothing, strong flowery perfumes, or carry overripe fruit and aromatic foods.
One should cover up with long-sleeve shirts, tuck pant legs into socks, and use mosquito
netting.</p>

<p>Diethyl-toluene (DEET) is a commonly used chemical found in most bug repellents (ie. <i>Deep
Woods, Off Skintastic</i>, etc.). Although these products are very effective, here are 10
helpful hints when using these potentially dangerous products: 

<ul>
  <p>1) Do not use on children less than 6 months of age.<br>
  2) Do not use repellents containing greater than 50% DEET.<br>
  3) Avoid long-term use and frequent total body application.<br>
  4) Liquids and lotion are preferred over sprays because it is easier to control their
  application.<br>
  5) Do not apply on the hands of children who like to put their hands in their mouths.<br>
  6) Avoid contact with the eyes and mucous membranes.<br>
  7) Wash off repellent once exposure to insects has passed.<br>
  8) Accidental swallowing of DEET products can be fatal. Store repellents out of the reach
  of children.<br>
  9) Never use repellents of open wounds or irritated skin.<br>
  10) Repellents can be sprayed on clothes (provided the clothes are not made of synthetic
  fibres, ie. rayon).<br>
  </p>
</ul>

<p>Citronella based repellents (candles and sprays) provide short-term protection from
mosquitoes and black flies. Some products are touted as insect repellents--Avon's <i>Skin-So-Soft</i>
and oral Vitamin B1 (thiamine); however, very little evidence is available to support
their effectiveness.</p>

<p>No matter how hard you try, bug bites are inevitable. The most important factor in
treating the itchy sites is to minimize scratching and thereby avoiding infection.
Application of ice or an ice-pack, or applying a baking soda paste helps reduce swelling.
Colloidal oatmeal baths (<i>Aveeno</i>), calamine lotion and hydrocortisone cream can
alleviate itchiness. Oral antihistamines (<i>Benadryl, Chlor-Tripolon</i>) tend to reduce
the allergic symptoms. Ammonium containing bite &quot;neutralizers&quot; (<i>After Bite</i>)
provide a cooling sensation which may be caused by the evaporation of the product. Topical
anesthetics (<i>Solarcaine, Stop Itch</i>) offer some degree of relief by numbing the
areas for 30-45 minutes. Prevention is preferred to treatment.</p>
