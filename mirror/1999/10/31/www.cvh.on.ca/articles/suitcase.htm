<p>Recognizing the need to educate children about hospital care, The Credit Valley
Hospital can bring the hospital right to the community's children with a popular resource
known as <i>The Travelling Suitcase</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Travelling Suitcase</i> is like a hospital in a trunk, and includes plenty of
dress-up items, real medical props and supplies, and a variety of written and visual
resources aimed at preschool and elementary school students' intellectual level.</p>

<p>Being at a curious age, children will be fascinated to listen to one another's
heartbeats with a real stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, and to see what everything from a
broken bone to a swallowed toy car looks like on an x-ray.</p>

<p>Aimed at easing children's natural fear of what goes on inside hospitals, <i>The
Travelling Suitcase</i> also contains resource material and a video entitled
&quot;Adventures of Ruffus and Andy: The Rescue.&quot; This short video, among the
collection of educational videos produced by The Credit Valley Hospital, shows how Ruffus
and Andy, the puppet dog and boy duo, learn how much fun a hospital can be when they go to
&quot;save&quot; their friend Sara, who is in for a tonsillectomy.</p>

<p>To rent <i>The Travelling Suitcase</i> for your classroom, club, or any other group of
children, please contact (905) 813-1585. The cost is $10 per week, plus a $10 returnable
deposit. </p>
