<p>Nutritional Guidelines For Vomiting and Diarrhea </font></p>

<p>During the first twelve hours, if you are breastfeeding continue to feed as often as
possible. Nurse for shorter periods and more often. If you are formula-feeding you may
need to stop for a short period of time. Stop all solid foods at this time.</p>

<p>Your child needs extra fluids to replace the natural balance of water, sugar and salt
in her/his body. The best type of fluid is an oral electrolyte solution such as,
Gastrolyte or Pedialyte which are available in most drug stores (Lytren is used in
hospital). The following chart gives you an idea of how much oral electrolyte solution
your child will need. Let your child sip on the solution over a long period of time
(spoon-feed if necessary):Less than 6 months, 30-60ml or 1-3oz every hour.6-24 months,
90-125ml or 3-4oz every hour.Over 2 years, 125-250ml or 4-8oz every hour.</p>

<p>During the next 12-24 hours continue breastfeeding or formula-feeding your baby. If
your child is receiving formula there is no need to change to a lactose-free formula
unless your doctor or dietitian recommends it. Infants and children who normally eat solid
foods may now be gradually fed their regular diet.</p>

<p>It is important your child not be fed a liquid diet for more than 24 hours. Your child
should be eating a normal diet (with minimal restrictions) 3-4 days after the diarrhea
started. At this time, give frequent smaller meals (example: 5-6 small meals per day) to
ensure healthy eating. It is normal for diarrhea to continue for 7-10 days.</p>

<p>Do not give your child any fruit drinks, juices, soft drinks, jello, jello-water, tea,
boullion, Gatorade, popsicles, sugar water, commercially prepared soups and sweet desserts
during these early stages. </p>
