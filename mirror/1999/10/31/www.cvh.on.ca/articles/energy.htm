<p>Conserving Your Energy (The Better Way)</p>

<p></font>Energy conservation means getting the most done, whether it is work, selfcare or
leisure, using the least amount of your body's energy resources. This helps you to stay
well, and allows more energy for the activities you enjoy.</p>

<p>Energy conservation will help you to manage fatigue, which is a common symptom of
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease and multiple sclerosis. There is no
need to feel guilty, lazy or embarrassed about doing things in a way which saves your
energy.</p>

<p>Following these principles is important and can be implemented easily in all aspects of
your daily life. 

<ol>
  <li>Find your balance between rest and activity. Recognize 3 types of rest: <ul>
      <li>Sleep, naps; </li>
      <li>Rest to specific joints or muscles; for example, resting your hands after knitting; </li>
      <li>Emotional rest, such as relaxing with soft music, and then make them a part of your day.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Try to:<ul>
      <li>learn your tolerance and rest before you tire;</li>
      <li>pace yourself, stop before you become exhausted;</li>
      <li>schedule short rest breaks during the day, and get 8-12 hours of sleep at night.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Be organized: plan to do tasks during the time of day you have the most energy. Plan
    ahead, make schedules, set priorities, but be flexible. Alternate periods of work and
    activity with periods of rest. Spread difficult work throughout the day or week. </li>
  <li>Simplify your work, make it easier: ask yourself: Do I have to do this? Is there a
    better way? Can someone else do this? Can I do some of this later? For example: air dry
    your dishes, use adapted aids suggested by your Occupational Therapist, slide objects
    along the counter instead of lifting. </li>
  <li>Work in Comfort. Maintain good sitting and standing posture; sitting instead of standing
    can save up to 25% of your energy. Minimize unnecessary straining, stretching, twisting,
    and bending, eg. place articles within easy reach. A comfortable working table height
    should be 2'-3' below elbow level. </li>
  <li>Relax and avoid stress. Don't let others or allow yourself to place extra demands on
    you, especially on days you have more fatigue than usual. Don't be afraid or feel guilty
    to say &quot;no&quot; if you're too tired. Stress is fatiguing. Find pleasant relaxing
    activities and outlets. Save your energy for the things you enjoy most in life!</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember: The way you do what you do is more important than what you are doing!</p>

<p>Please contact your Occupational Therapist if you have any further questions
(905-813-1570). </p>
