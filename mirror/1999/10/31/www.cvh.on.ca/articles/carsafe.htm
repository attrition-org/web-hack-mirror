<p>Car safety </font></p>

<p>The law requires that all children be secured while in a car.</p>

<p>Motor-vehicle accidents are the number one killer and crippler of preschool children.
For that age group, there is a 40 - 50 times greater risk of death from car accidents than
from all the preventable infectious diseases combimed.</p>

<p>Most car deaths are the result of children being thrown from the vehicle. Infant and
child-restraint seats, when used property, can reduce fatalities by 90 per cent and
crippling injuries by 65 to 70 per cent.</p>

<p>Car seats should be used from a baby's first journey in a car, starting with a
newborn's trip home from the hospital. Accident investigations have proven that adults,
even when wearing a seat belt, cannot hold on to a child in a collision. (The Credit
Valley Hospital provides a car-seat rental service.)</p>

<p><b>Proper Seats</b></p>

<p>Car seats are available for children of all ages and sizes. The correct seats protect
critical areas and absorb shock forces in a collision or accident. Before you buy or rent
a car seat, make sure it is right for the age and weight of your baby or child, and that
it can be installed in your particular vehicle. The rear-facing infant seat is the only
safe seat for children under 9kg (20lbs).</p>

<p>Make certain that the car seat is installed correctly. Follow the manufacturer's
instructions precisely, as this could mean the difference between the seat efficiently
protecting the child in an accident or not.</p>

<p>All car seats sold in Canada must meet certain safety standards and bear labels to this
effect. Check with Transport Canada, your provincial department of transport or your
regional office of the Canadian Automobile Association for details on variety and special
safety features.</p>

<p>Note: If you buy or borrow a used car seat, make sure that it has not been involved in
an accident. If it has, it should not be used again, as it may be structuraly weakened and
unable to withstand the force of a second accident.</p>

<p><b>General Car Safety</b></p>

<p>Never allow a child to stand or kneel on any seat while the car is in motion.</p>

<p>Never leave your baby or small child alone in the car whether the car is locked or not.</p>

<p>Cigarette lighters should be removed from your car. Check for lighters in the back seat
as well, particularly in newer models.</p>

<p>Your car should have child-proof locks on the back doors. (In most newer models, these
are standard equipment).</p>
