<p>Asthma Education Centre </font></p>

<p><font face="default" color="#001058">The Asthma Education Centre (AEC) was introduced
to help children and their families learn how to cope with asthma and enjoy a normal,
healthy lifestyle.</font></p>

<p><font face="default" color="#001058">Each appointment is a one-to-one format with an
asthma educator and will cover many aspects about asthma, such as - what happens during an
attack, what triggers asthma, what each medication is for, how to administer your
medications and recognizing your symptoms.&nbsp; The staff of AEC will try to answer all
of your questions!</font></p>

<p><font face="default" color="#001058">The Asthma Education Centre is open 2 1/2 days
each week for children between the ages of 1 to 18.&nbsp; A referral from a family
physician is required.</font></p>

<p><font face="default" color="#001058">Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the
session with their children.</font></p>

<p><font face="default" color="#001058">For more information, please contact the AEC at
