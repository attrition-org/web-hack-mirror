<p>Common Cold - Adult </font></p>

<p>A cold is a viral infection involving any or all of the nose, throat, sinuses, ears,
larynx, bronchil tubes. Common symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, watery
eyes, sore throat, cough, a slight fever, decreased appetite, fatigue and body aches.
Colds are contagious during the first 3-4 days and are spread by coughs, sneezes and
direct hand-to-hand contact. A cold is not caused by cold air or drafts. Your own body
defenses will usually clear up a cold in 3-4 days, but some people may be sick for a week
or two. Antibiotics cannot cure the common cold and can expose you to the risk of drug
side effects.</p>

<p>There are things that can be done to make an adult with a cold feel better. Adequate
rest, lots of clear fluids (cold or hot), acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ASA (Aspirin) in
recommended doses and a vaporizer to humidify the air, all can help the symptoms. Your
doctor may also suggest decongestants, medicated gargles, throat lozenges or cough syrops
to ease the symptoms.</p>

<p>To minimize the chance of spreading your cold to others, cover your mouth and nose when
you sneeze or cough and wash your hands often.</p>

<p>Symptoms which should make you see a doctor again: Throat pain which is getting more
severe especially if white spots appear in the throat or on the tonsils; Swollen or tender
glands in the neck; A fever above 38.5 C (103 F) which lasts more than 2 days; Shaking
chills and sweats; Earache or severe headache or pain over the sinuses or teeth. Chest
pain, shortness of breath or wheezing; A severe cough with thick yellow-green, greyish or
bloody phlegm. A cough lasting longer than 10 days; A stiff neck, any body rash, extreme
fatigue, bizarre behaviour; A blue or grey colour of the lips, skin or fingernails. </p>
