<p>Use your head. Wear a helmet. </font></p>

<p>All head injuries are not alike. Two common causes of brain injury are:</p>

<p>1. Shattering the skull and piercing the brain with bone and other objects.</p>

<p>2. Violently shaking the brain inside the skull.</p>

<p><b>Your bicycle helmet should:</b></p>

<p>Reduce the forces of impact on the head.<br>
Prevent cuts to the head and withstand penetration by sharp objects.<br>
Fit and fasten well, to remain in position under stress.<br>
Not deteriorate under normal usage and exposure.</p>

<p><b>Elements of a good helmet:</b></p>

<p>The body of the helmet, made of dense, crushable material, acts to distribute and
absorb the force of impact.</p>

<p>An outer shell, when present, adds load-spreading capability and prevents objects from
penetrating the helmet and causing injury to the head.</p>

<p>The lining insures a comfortable and snug fit.</p>

<p>The retention system is composed of flexible straps and hardware to keep the helmet on
your head. It must be strong, comfortable and well fitting. The buckle must fasten
securely.</p>

<p><b>Finding a good helmet:</b></p>

<p>There are many good helmets on the market today. The easiest way to find a helmet that
is well made and reliable is to look for the &quot;SNELL&quot; certification sticker.</p>

<p>Production units of helmet models carrying the decal have met rigorous standards in
tests performed by the Snell Foundation.</p>

<p>It is difficult for one helmet design to protect against all possible injuries. No
helmet provides complete protection but some helmets are better than others. Even the best
helmet may not be good enough in a severe accident. For this reason the Snell sticker
reads: &quot;Warning: Some reasonably fore-seeable impacts may exceed this helmet's
capability to protect against severe injury&quot;. Based on three decades of research, a
Snell certified helmet is indisputably one of the best.</p>

<p><b>The Snell Foundation urges you to:</b></p>

<p>1. Make sure the helmet fits your head. 

<ul>
  <li>Try the helmet on before you buy it.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Adjust the chinstrap firmly but comfortably.<br>
  </li>
  <li>If simple hand pressure shifts the helmet significantly, or forces it off of your head
    they try another helmet size or design.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. Wear the helmet correctly. 

<ul>
  <li>Wear it every time you bicycle.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Wear it low on your forehead just above your eyebrows.<br. <li>Always fasten the chinstrap
    firmly.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. Read and follow all directions carefully. 

<ul>
  <li>Only use manufacturer approved decoration and cleaners.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Replace the helmet if it has been damaged.</li>
</ul>
