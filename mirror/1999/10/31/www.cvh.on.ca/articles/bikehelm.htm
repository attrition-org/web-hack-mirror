<p>Bicycle Helmets </font></p>

<p>Cycling is increasing in popularity as a sport and in recreation. However, head
injuries from bicycle accidents may cause brain damage or death. Bicycle helmets will
significantly reduce the severity of injury.</p>

<p>The Canadian Standards Association has developed a bicycle helmet standard that offers
basic performance requirements which the helmet must meet. These include the ability to
withstand a series of impact tests, a test of the strength of the helmet retention system
(chin strap), and minimum head coverage requirements. Look for the CSA label when
purchasing a helmet.</p>

<p>When purchasing a helmet, several factors must be considerred; (soft, thin or
hardshell), weight, coolness, fit, and price. The price of cycling helmets varies with the
type of helmet and brand.</p>

<p><b>Type of Helmet: Softshell, Hardshell, or Thinshell</b></p>

<p>Most bicycle helmets contain a thick foam liner made of expanded polystyrene that
absorbs energy during impact. Softshell helmets are made of foam only and are extremely
lightweight. However, they may not protect the rider against sharp objects which may
puncture the helmet.</p>

<p>Hardshell helmets have a thick layer of plastic or fibreglass covering the foam. This
layer may protect the rider from penetration of sharp objects. Such helmets may also
withstand occasional bumps during handling without damaging their exterior. However, these
helmets are heavier than the soft shell helmets.</p>

<p>Thinshell helmets consist of a thin or &quot;microshell&quot; layer of plastic over the
foam liner. This helmet is similar to the hardshell but is much lighter in weight while
improving the durability of the outer surface of the foam liner.</p>

<p>Younger children require a lighter helmet due to their developing neck muscles which
may not be able to support a heavier helmet. If unsure of your child's ability to support
the weight of a helmet, consult your physician.</p>

<p><b>Fit</b></p>

<p>Make sure the helmet fits snugly and is comfortable. Check for stability. When
purchasing a helmet, try it on. Adjust the straps and comfort pads and attempt to pull the
helmet off your head. The helmet should not move much or come off. Try on several
different helmet models - they all seem to fit slightly differently. To be effective, the
helmet should sit completely level on the head. It should not be inclined too far forward
or back on the head.</p>

<p><b>Attachment System</b></p>

<p>The front and rear straps should meet just below each ear when tightly adjusted. The
chin strap should be snug without pinching.</p>

<p><b>Ventilation</b></p>

<p>Coolness of the helmet is an important feature for many cyclists. Heat is created
during exercise and rises through the head. Air vents allow the heat to escape providing
coolness and sweat control. Large front vents usually provide better air flow.</p>

<p><b>Visibility</b></p>

<p>Look for brightly coloured helmets for visibility and style. Some helmets have
reflective strips that enhance visibility. Black helmets are difficult for motorists to
see.</p>

<p><b>Replacement</b></p>

<p>Helmets are designed to crush on inmpact. Therefore, replace the helmet when it has
been involved in a crash. Normal wear and tear may put dents in the helmet which may
decrease its safety. The helmet is less protective but the damage may not be visible.</p>
