<p>Benzodiazepines </font></p>

<p>Most medications prescribed today to treat anxiety and insomnia belong to a group of
drugs called benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines work by calming your central nervous system.
Frequently prescribed benzodiazepines include lorazepam (e.g., Ativan), alprazolam (e.g.,
Xanax), diazepam (e.g., Valium), temazepam (e.g., Restoril), and triazolam (e.g.,
Halcion). Often, their chemical names end in the letters &quot;pam&quot; or
&quot;am&quot;.</p>

<p>Used correctly, under the direction of your doctor, these medications are effective and
safe. For anxiety and sleep problems, benzodiazepines are usually prescribed only for
short periods - a few weeks or months. However, some people may need to take
benzodiazepines for a longer period of time.</p>

<p>How will benzodiazepines affect me? The way these medications - or any other drug -
affect you depends on many factors, including: the amount you take; how long you take a
drug; whether you're also taking other medications or drugs; your age.</p>

<p>Benzodiazepines can help relieve sleep problems and symptoms of anxiety. They have also
been used in the treatment of panic disorders, seizures and muscle spasms.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, a small dose tends to make you feel relaxed and calm. A larger dose
may make you feel drowsy and clumsy.</p>

<p>These medications should be taken as directed by your physician. You should never take
more than your doctor prescribes. Otherwise, you may become too sedated.</p>

<p>If you take benzodiazepines regularly (e.g., every day) for a long time, they may
become habit-forming.</p>

<p>How safe are benzodiazepines? These medications are generally considered safe when
taken as directed by your doctor. In current medical practice, they are usually prescribed
in low dosages for short periods (i.e., a few weeks or months).</p>

<p>When you start taking a benzodiazepine, you may experience side-effects such as
drowsiness, dizziness and light-headedness. You may be unsteady on your feet and less
alert. Often these symptoms pass as your body adjusts. Until you are sure of your reaction
to this drug, avoid driving and always use caution in tasks demanding alertness.</p>

<p>Side-effects concern everyone, especially seniors, who are more sensitive to the
effects and side-effects of drugs. Some people may feel &quot;hung over&quot; on the day
after taking the medication and may be more prone to falls and injuries. These issues may
be of particular concern with long-acting benzodiazepines like flurazepam. It has also
been suggested that benzodiazepines can impair the ability to learn and remember new
information.</p>

<p>Benzodiazepines may be prescribed to relieve sleeplessness. But some people who have
trouble sleeping may have a hidden reason for their insomnia (such as depression or
another illness). A physician may prescribe benzodiazepines until the underlying reason
for the insomnia is discovered. Then, a more appropriate treatment may be suggested. This
is one reason that benzodiazepines tend not to be prescribed for long periods of time to
treat insomnia.</p>

<p>Your doctor or pharmacist can warn you about medications to avoid while taking
benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines can increase the effects of alcohol and other drugs
(e.g., cold, allergy and pain preparations, and other sleep medications).</p>

<p>Remember, avoid driving when you have taken a benzodiazepine and have also had some
alcohol. Mixing benzodiazepines with other drugs may cause excessive drowsiness and
potentially dangerous sedation.</p>

<p>An overdose of benzodiazepines can cause unconsciousness or even death. Warning signs
that you've taken too much include: severe drowsiness; slurred speech; weakness and
staggering.</p>

<p>If you notice any of these signs after taking the medication, contact your doctor.</p>

<p>A few people have experienced mental and behavioral changes while taking
benzodiazepines. If you experience any changes in your behavior or mental state (such as
confusion, bizarre behavior, aggression, etc.), consult your doctor immediately.</p>

<p>If you're taking benzodiazepines and are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant,
talk to your doctor because they may affect your baby. For example, using benzodiazepines
while you're pregnant can lead to withdrawal symptoms in your baby after it is born.
Benzodiazepines are also passed on through breast milk. You shouldn't stop the medication
on your own; check with your doctor first.</p>

<p>As with all medications, keep benzodiazepines out of the reach of children - they're
more sensitive than adults to the effects of benzodiazepines.</p>

<p>Are benzodiazepines addictive? They can be. It depends on how much of the medication
you take, how long you take it, and whether you have been dependent on any other drug.</p>

<p>If this medication is used regularly for more than a few weeks, your body may become
used to the presence of benzodiazepines and you may feel that you need them.</p>

<p>To avoid becoming dependent on benzodiazepines, don't take more of the medication than
your doctor prescribes, and don't take it more often or for longer than directed.</p>

<p>Do not stop taking benzodiazepines without first consulting your doctor. Stopping
suddenly may bring on symptoms that are similar to conditions for which the medications
were originally prescribed. Withdrawal symptoms can be mild (e.g., trouble sleeping,
feeling unwell) or severe (e.g., anxiety, trembling, cramps), and, in rare cases after
high doses are stopped quickly, psychosis and convulsions can occur.</p>

<p>Usually, physicians taper off the medication slowly, over time. Even then, there is a
chance that you may experience some temporary discomfort. Any withdrawal symptoms will
subside with time, as the body readjusts.</p>

<p>Regularly discuss your need for the medication with your doctor. Do not get your
prescription for benzodiazepines refilled indefinitely at your pharmacy. In most cases,
benzodiazepines do not need to be used for longer than four months. Are there alternatives
to the use of benzodiazepines? Although some people with specific conditions might have to
take benzodiazepines for a long period of time, others may benefit from alternatives to
relieve anxiety and sleeplessness.</p>

<p>To relieve stress, it may be useful to: try relaxation exercises and tapes, take long
walks, find new interests and hobbies, and talk about your troubles with a friend.</p>

<p>People who take benzodiazepines to help them sleep may find that the medication is less
effective after a few weeks. For a more permanent solution, and as an alternative to drug
therapy, consider the following tips: exercise regularly and get some fresh air during the
day, but avoid strenuous activity before bed; avoid naps during the day; have a warm glass
of milk or a light snack before bed; take a warm bath before bed; try not to dwell on your
problems at night; share your worries with close friends; make your sleeping area a
comfortable, soothing place; keep alcohol and caffeinated drinks to a minimum, especially
in the evening; go to bed when you are tired and not before; get up at the same time each
morning; if you can't fall asleep, get up and do something relaxing until you are drowsy.</p>

<p>Also, remember that sleep patterns change as you get older. Seniors, for example, may
not need as much sleep as they once did. If you have any concerns about your benzodiazpine
use, consult your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
