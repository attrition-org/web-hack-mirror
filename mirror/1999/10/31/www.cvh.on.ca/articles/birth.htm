    <td align="left" width="580">With a focus on individual needs, the program fosters the
    best use of resources. Based on a family centred philosophy, care focuses on using adult
    principles of learning. Our families can work together with their nurse to identify their
    learning needs and develop a learning plan to assist them through their early days of
    parenting. Cultural differences must be considered and respected. <p>Our program starts
    with a visit to the Maternal Child Services for a <b>PRE-REGISTRATION INTERVIEW</b>. It is
    highly recommended early in pregnancy, (within the first 12 weeks) patients attend a one
    half hour pre-registration interview with a registered nurse who will complete an
    assessment and nursing data base. This information will help facilitate mother's admission
    to the Labour and Delivery Room. At this time, the nurse will invite a Family Interaction
    Assessment Tool. If the psychosocial assessment warrants further family support, your
    physician is contacted for referral to the appropriate multidisciplinary team member. At
    your interview, arrangements are made for appropriate laboratory or imaging tests
    &nbsp; (i.e. ultrasound) ordered by your physician. To familiarize patients and families
    with the Obstetrical Unit, patients are booked for a 36 week class which includes a tour
    of the hospital. </p>

    Postpartum</b></font><strong> (After Birth)</strong></p>
    <p>To best accommodate all of these bundles of joy, a 24/74 hour length of stay was
    implemented in 1995. The length of stay for mother and baby delivered vaginally is 24
    hours and for a mother and baby delivered by Caesarean birth is 72 hours. In order for our
    mothers and newborns to take advantage of a 24 or 72 hour discharge, certain criteria must
    be met. The patient must be without medical complications or any factor which would
    require a lengthened stay. The patient must be adjusting to both the physical and
    emotional changes of the early postpartum period appropriately. </p>
    <p>To ensure ongoing support to our families who are discharge at 24 or 72 hours, the
    following programs have been put in place: </p>
