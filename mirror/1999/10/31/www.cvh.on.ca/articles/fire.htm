<p>Fire in the home - get out safely </font></p>

<p>When fire strikes get out and stay out.</p>

<p>Raise the alarm. When you detect fire or smoke shout to warn the other occupants.
Children and older people will need help. Don't wait to get dressed, shoes and one blanket
per person will suffice - even in cold weather. Have a neighbour call the fire department
after all are out. Never waste time trying to extinguish anything other than a very small
fire. </p>

<p>A hot door is a warning. Never open a door without first checking it for heat. If it is
warm, leave it closed and go out a window. If this is impossible wait by an open window or
on a balcony for rescue. Place bedding at door cracks to keep smoke out. </p>

<p>Heat and deadly gases are the main killers. Even a small fire is dangerous. The open
interior stairs in the single family home may become a chimney allowing heat and smoke to
rise to highest floor level. If you cannot leave an upper room by a window, close the door
and wait by the open window for rescue. </p>

<p>Tell the fire fighters if anyone remains in the building. Leave rescue operations to
them, unless you can safely raise a ladder or help anyone down from a window or roof
before help arrives. </p>

<p>Never go back into a burning building for any reason whatsoever. Many lives are lost
through the deadly effects of fumes, even from small fires. Never risk a life in an
attempt to save personal possessions. </p>

<p>Remember: an hour of pre-planning may save years of life. Make regular fire drills a
family affair. </p>

<p>A smoke alarm on each level of your house will provide early warning of fire. </p>

<p>Hot gases rise. The cleanest, coolest air is near the floor. </p>

<p>To break a window, use a chair or other heavy object, shielding the face against
splinters. Remove jagged pieces from the frame. </p>

<p>A closed door provides some protection against fire or fumes. Keep basement or utility
room doors closed at all times, and close all doors at bedtime. </p>

<p>Keep the fire department number near your phone and memorize it. If you phone in an
alarm, give your address first, in case your call is interrupted. </p>

<p>Check your home for fire hazards and eliminate them as you find them. Your fire
department will be glad to advise you on any question of fire safety for your home. </p>

<p>Wherever you are, at home or away, always be on guard against fire. In theatres, hotels
or other unfamiliar buildings, find the fire exits after you enter. In industrial or
office buildings, familiarize yourself with exit routes and evacuation procedures. If you
live or work in a high-rise building, fire resistive construction and enclosed stairways
contribute to your safety, but you must plan ahead. When fire breaks out, it may be too
late to learn your escape route. </p>

<p>Always feel every door for heat before opening it in time of fire. If trapped on an
upper floor, shout for help or sound the alarm. Wait for help behind closed doors. If
there is a balcony, wait there, closing the door behind you. </p>

<p>Remember that your first thought should be for your own safety, and the safety of those
who need your help, but leave fire fighting and rescue to the trained men and women of the
fire department. </p>

<p>Experience and research have found that it is desirable to have a smoke alarm on each
level of your home. The basement alarm is preferably located on the ceiling near the
stairs, not in the stairwell. </p>

<p>For performance and reliability be sure the smoke alarms are labelled by Underwriters'
Laboratories of Canada. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for mounting these devices.
