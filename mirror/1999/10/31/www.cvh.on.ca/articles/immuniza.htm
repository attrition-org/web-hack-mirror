<p>Immunization - your best protection </font></p>

<p>Tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine protects people against these serious diseases. It
is given to people who are seven years of age or older.</p>

<p>Tetanus is also called lockjaw and it is a serious disease. The tetanus germ is found
in dirt. Dirt can get into a cut in the skin. Even with early treatment, tetanus kills two
out of every 10 people who get it.</p>

<p>Diphtheria is an infection of the nose, throat and skin. It can cause breathing
problems, heart failure and nerve damage. Diphtheria kills one out of every 10 people who
get the disease.</p>

<p>Td vaccine protects more than nine out of 10 people who get all their needles. Most
people are vaccinated against tetanus and diphtheria in early childhood. Around the 15th
birthday, a Td booster needle is given to people who were vaccinated against tetanus and
diphtheria at an early age. Adults should get Td vaccine every 10 years.</p>

<p>The Td vaccine is safe. Serious side effects from Td vaccine are rare. Mild pain,
swelling and redness where the needle was given are common for a few days. A few people
may get a mild fever, lose their appetite or feel tired for a day or two.</p>

<p>Call your doctor if any of these symptoms happen within three days after the needle:
flushing of the skin; itching or hives; fast heart beat; swelling of the face or mouth;
trouble breathing. Also call your doctor if you have other serious health problems at any
time.</p>

<p>The doctor or nurse may not give Td vaccine if the person is ill with a fever or an
infection worse than a cold. Talk to your doctor or call your public health department for
more information. </p>
