<p>Child safety </font></p>

<p>Your home is a place where your child is safe from harm - or should be. Children are
curious and cannot easily recognize and avoid hazards; therefore, they need extra
protection and care. Many burns, poisonings and falls can be avoided. By supervising your
children carefully and making their surroundings safe, you can prevent injuries.</p>

<p>Canadian consumers spend approximately $1.3 billion a year on toys. It is important to
know that no matter how much safety is built into a toy, supervision, proper use and
maintenance of toys are essential.</p>

<p>Select only toys suitable for the child's age group, and make sure to read and follow
all instructions that come with the toy.</p>

<p>Toys with small parts are dangerous for children under three years. Keep them out of
their reach.</p>

<p>Check toys regularly and throw away broken toys which may have sharp edges.</p>

<p>Keep plush toys and soft toys away from stoves, fireplaces, heaters and other sources
of heat.</p>

<p>Make sure that large toy boxes have good ventilation in case a child climbs inside.</p>

<p>Choose toy boxes with lids that are light-weight and have good supporting hinges; heavy
lids have fallen on children's necks causing death.</p>

<p>Toy boxes should be inspected regularly to ensure the hinges are secure and
well-maintainted.</p>

<p>Although balloons are not toys, children do play with them. It is dangerous for a child
to play with broken balloons or deflated balloons. Throw away pieces of broken balloons.
Always blow up balloons for children and supervise children playing with balloons.</p>

<p><b>Toys with batteries</b></p>

<p>Make sure batteries in toys for young children are properly installed and not
accessible to the child.</p>

<p>It is dangerous to mix older batteries with newer ones, or to mix alkaline with carbon,
or rechargeable with non-rechargeable.</p>

<p>A child should not take battery-operated toys to bed.</p>

<p>If a child swallows a button battery, call your doctor or poison control centre
immediately.</p>

<p><b>Baby walkers</b></p>

<p>Babies in walkers can move quickly, run into hidden dangers, bump into furniture, pull
on hanging appliance cords and tip over. Falls down stairs in walkers are the largest
cause of head injuries in children under the age of two. Babies in walkers should be
watched at all times. If you decide to use a baby walker, ensure that it fully meets the
requirements of the Canadian Juvenile Products Association's Voluntary Safety Standard for
baby walkers.</p>

<p><b>Strollers</b></p>

<p>Many children are injured in baby stroller and carriage incidents because the lap belt
was not property fastened, or children were left unattended - for just a moment!</p>

<p>Choose a sturdy stroller that is recommended for your child's weight and height.</p>

<p>Make sure that the lap belt is solidly attached to the seat or frame of the stroller.
The seat should not pull away from the frame, even if you pull sharply on the lap belt.</p>

<p>Always use the harness or lap belt.</p>

<p>Use the brakes and make sure the wheels are fixed tightly.</p>

<p>Before making adjustments to the stroller, ensure that the child's hands and feet are
clear.</p>

<p>Do not carry additional children, goods or accessories in or on the stroller except as
recommended in the manufacturer's instructions.</p>

<p>Do not use a stroller on an escalator.</p>

<p><b>Cribs</b></p>

<p>Older cribs manufactured before September 1986 do not meet government safety
regulations and should not be used. It is illegal to sell or advertise these cribs.
However, they are often sold at garage sales and flea markets, or found in cottages or
relatives' homes. The date of manufacture must appear on post-1986 cribs. You can be
confident that new cribs sold in stores meet safety regulations.</p>

<p>Mattresses that are too soft or worn down in any area could cause a gap or hollow where
a baby's head could become trapped causing the child to suffocate. Mattresses should fit
snugly on all sides of the crib.</p>

<p>After placing your baby in the crib, ensure the sides are locked securely in position.</p>

<p>Babies should never be harnessed or tied in a crib, and should not be left in a crib
with a necklace, elastic band, scarf, or a pacifier on a long cord that could cause
strangulation.</p>

<p>As soon as your baby is able to stand, ensure the mattress is at its lowest position
and remove bumper pads and large toys that could serve as steps to climb out with risk of
fall and injury.</p>

<p>Keep the crib away from window curtain or blind cords. The baby's neck could become
entangled in one of the cords or strings, resulting in strangulation.</p>

<p>For greater safety, do not place a baby under two years of age on an adult bed without
adult supervision. Never place a baby on a water bed.</p>

<p>To reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, it is recommended that normal,
healthy infants be placed on their back or side for sleep and that they be cared for in a
smoke-free environment. If a room temperature is comfortable for adults, it is likely fine
for an infant. Infants should be dressed and covered in a manner to avoid over-heating,
even during an illness.</p>

<p><b>High Chairs</b></p>

<p>Many children are injured by falling from high chairs or sliding under the tray. In
most instances, injuries can be prevented if the harness or belt is property used and the
child is closely supervised.</p>

<p>A safe high chair is stable and has a wide base to reduce the risk of tipping. The
harness should consist of a strap which fits between the child's legs and a waist belt
that is easy to fasten and kept in good condition. Set up and maintain the high chairs as
recommended by the manufacturer. Ensure that the child's hands, arms and legs are clear of
any moving parts before making adjustments to the chair or the tray. Never allow older
children to climb onto the chair. Keep the chair a safe distance away from walls, doors,
windows, blind cords, mirrors, appliances and other furniture. </p>

<p><b>Change Tables</b></p>

<p>When using a change table, remember that in the moment it takes you to reach for
something, your baby can roll over and fall. Change tables should have straps to help keep
the baby in place while being dressed. If you are interrupted by the telephone or
doorbell, or for any other reason, always take the child with you.</p>

<p><b>Car Seats</b></p>

<p>All provinces require that children be property restrained when travelling in a motor
vehicle. Make sure children's car seats have a label stating that they conform to the
Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (CMVSS) administered by Transport Canada.</p>

<p>Make sure that the car seat is properly installed in the car by following the
manufacturer's instructions closely. Make sure the car seat used is appropriate for the
child's age and weight. Use the straps and belt of the child's car seat properly. Most
U.S. car seats do not meet Canadian standards and should not be used in Canada. For more
information on children's car seats and safety, contact your nearest Canadian Automobile
Association office listed in the telphone book.</p>

<p><b>Infant Carriers</b></p>

<p>Infant carriers can be dangerous if not used properly. Each year babies suffer injuries
because they were left unattended in an infant carrier. An infant carrier should have a
wide, solid base so it can't tip over. An infant carrier is not a car seat and must never
be used as one.</p>

<p>Fasten straps and restraining buckles every time you use the seat. They should be
adjusted to fit comfortably and prevent the child from turning in the seat. Crossed straps
should be placed low enough to avoid the infant's neck, even if the infant slips down in
the seat.</p>

<p>Adult beds, especially water beds, and other surfaces that are not completely firm,
should not be used as a base or resting place for infant carriers. Never leave a child
alone in an infant carrier, even when it seems safe.</p>

<p><b>Bunk Beds</b></p>

<p>Of course bunk beds can be a great way to save space in your home but they can also be
dangerous! The upper bed of bunk beds is hazardous when used for children under six. A
number of deaths have been reported in Canada since 1985 involving children under six
placed in the upper bunk. Typically, the children suffocated when their bodies slipped
between the guard rail and the mattress. Their faces became stuck against the mattress. In
another case, a two-year old suffocated when he became wedged between the upper bunk and
the wall. The upper edge of the top rail should be at least 13cm above the mattress. The
distance from the frame to the bottom edge of the lower rail should not be more than 9cm.
The Product Safety Bureau has received complaints from parents who noticed that the welds
were cracking on their tubular metal bunk beds. In some cases, the beds collapsed and
children were injured.</p>

<p>The upper bunk should never be used for children under six. Make sure the upper bunk
has guard rails on all sides. Mattresses should fit snugly on all sides leaving no gaps
between the mattress and the sides of the bed.</p>

<p><b>Safety Gates</b></p>

<p>Some safety gates manufactured before 1990 do not meet safety regulations and should
not be used. These gates have wide v-shaped openings along the top or large diamond-shaped
opening along the sides.</p>

<p>When buying a used gate, make sure that it does not have any openings that chould trap
a child's head or neck. Select a gate that is recommended for the child's age. Gates
should be installed following the manufacturer's instructions. Always attach the gate
securely in the doorway or passage.</p>

<p><b>Playpens</b></p>

<p>If purchasing a used playpen, make sure the sides are made of mosquito-type netting. If
the mesh is larger, buttons or hooks on clothing could get caught. Sides must be firm and
sturdy and should be checked regularly for damage.</p>

<p>Avoid playpens that have sharp edges or hinges that can pinch fingers. Make sure side
latches are in their fully closed position when setting up a playpen.</p>

<p>Never leave an infant in a drop-sided playpen with the side down; the infant can roll
into the space between the mattress and the mesh side and suffocate.</p>

<p>Never put scarves, necklaces or cords in the playpen or around a child's neck. These
items can catch and strangle a child.</p>

<p>Vinyl rails of playpens or mattress pads with tears can be dangerous. A child can bite
off small pieces and choke. Remove toys strung across a playpen when your child begins to
push up on hands and kness. Toys the child can use as steps to climb out should also be
removed. </p>

<p><b>Pacifiers</b></p>

<p>A pacifier can quickly become a child's most precious possession. Never tie a pacifier
or any other object around a baby's neck. Infants can strangle when cords are tied around
their necks.</p>

<p>A teething ring should be used instead of a pacifier if the baby starts to chew on the
pacifier. When a baby chews on a pacifier, it could get stuck in the throat.</p>

<p>Changes in texture, tears or holes can appear with age, heat, exposure to food and
sunlight. Pacifiers should be changed every two months rather than waiting for signs of
breakdown. Remember that some medicine can damage a pacifier.</p>

<p><b>Hook-on chairs</b></p>

<p>Hook-on chairs clamp onto the edge of a table. Be sure they are strong and securely
attached. The chair should be equipped with a harness or lap belt that is easy to fasten,
and kept in good condition. Not all tables can be used to attach a hook-on chair.</p>

<p>When attaching the chair to the table, place the chair away from table legs, so the
child cannot push with his/her feet and knock the chair off the table.</p>

<p><b>Children's clothing</b></p>

<p>Be careful when using loose-fitting cotton and cotton-blend homemade sleepwear for
children. Cotton and cotton-blend fabrics will catch fire and burn more quickly than most
synthetics. Nylon and polyester are more difficult to set on fire and burn more slowly.
Snug-fitting clothing is safer than clothing with flowing skirts, wide sleeves or large
ruffles.</p>

<p>Parents should dress their children in proper sleepwear as opposed to T-shirts or other
day clothes when putting children to bed. Drawstrings or cords on babies' clothing should
be removed. Children can strangle when drawstrings and cords get caught around their neck.</p>

<p>Check blankets and sleepers regularly for loose threads and fix them immediately. Nylon
threads can wrap around a baby's finger or neck and cause injury.</p>

<p><b>Burns</b></p>

<p>Every year in Canada, severe injuries and deaths occur as a result of burns and scalds.
Usually, it's children's curiosity that gets them into trouble. They come across a lighter
or matches or they manage to get too close to a baseboard heater or the hot element of a
stove.</p>

<p><b>Burns from hot liquids:</b></p>

<p>Test the water temperature before allowing your child to get into the bathtub or
shower. Always turn cold water on first, then add hot water. Children should not play with
a hot water tap. Avoid carrying or holding children while you are drinking hot beverages.</p>

<p><b>Burns from household appliances:</b></p>

<p>Turn pot handles towards the centre of the stove. Keep cords for electrical appliances
such as deep fryers, kettles, steam irons and toasters out of the reach of children.
Supervise children near lamps with accessible hot light bulbs. Store items that interest
children, such as cookies, away from the immediate area around the kitchen stove. Keep
children away from baseboard and portable heaters.</p>

<p><b>Lighters and matches</b></p>

<p>Keep lighters and matches out of the sight and reach of children. Install and maintain
smoke detectors. Fore more information on fire prevention, contact your local fire
department.</p>

<p><b>BBQs</b></p>

<p>Keep children away from BBQs at all times. Adults and children have died from carbon
monoxide poisoning, a colorless, odorless gas, when sleeping in a tent or trailer where
smoldering briquettes from the BBQ had been used for warmth.</p>

<p><b>Household chemicals</b></p>

<p>Household chemicals such as bleaches, paint thinners and paint removers, oven cleaners,
ammonia and abrasive cleaners are among the top household consumer products which cause
injuries and deaths in children under the age of five. Because products such as cleaning
liquids and powders, polishes and drain cleaners are so common, we forget how dangerous
they are. The major hidden hazard for all chemical products is the possible swallowing of
the product. However, the splashing of the product in the eyes and on the skin is also
important to avoid. Most household chemicals carry symbols and safety warnings on the
label. Learn the symbols; follow these five steps to safety:</p>

<p>Children are curious and move fast. Lock all chemical products out of the sight and
reach of children. Household chemical containers, even if sealed or empty, are not toys.
Never let children play with them.</p>

<p>Read the label. If there is anything in the label instructions that you don't
understand, ask for help. Make sure the labels on containers are not removed or covered
up.</p>

<p>Keep household chemicals in their original containers. Never mix them together. Some
mixtures can produce harmful gases.</p>

<p>Close the cap on the container tightly even if you set it down for just a moment. Make
sure that child-resistant containers are working. Child-resistant does not mean
child-proof!</p>

<p>Teach children that the symbols mean: Danger! Do not touch.</p>

<p><b>Playground and backyard play equipment</b></p>

<p>Children have died when their clothing or drawstrings got caught on playground
equipment or on fences. Other children have died when they became entangled on ropes or
skipping ropes attached to playground equipment.</p>

<p>Never tie mittens or anything else on a cord around a child's neck. Always take off,
tie up or tuck in cords and drawstrings on all clothing. Always remove ropes and skipping
ropes tied to slides and other playground equipment.</p>

<p><b>Drownings</b></p>

<p>Children love to play in and around water. Every year there are drowning that chould
have been prevented.</p>

<p>Supervise children in the bathtub. Do not rely on a bathseat to ensure the safety of a
young child in a bathtub. The suction cups on the seat might suddenly release, posing a
drowning hazard if the child is left unattended.</p>

<p>Keep small children away from five gallon buckets, diaper pails and other large
household containers of water. Toddlers have been known to fall into such products and
drown.</p>

<p>Be sure that the filter for an above-ground pool is located far enough from the pool to
prevent a child from climbing on it and falling into the water.</p>

<p>Be sure that backyard pools are well-enclosed, with a high fence of vertical bars and a
gate which is self-closing and self-locking. For more information on water safety, contact
your nearest branch of the Canadian Red Cross Society.</p>

<p><b>Second-hand products</b></p>

<p>If you are thinking of buying a used crib, playpen, stroller or other children's
products, or are about to inherit one from family or friends, be careful!</p>

<p>Even if they're only a few years old, some of these items can be in poor condition and
dangerous. Be aware that hidden damage to car seats and safety helmets makes these
products unsafe.</p>

<p>Be aware that there are government regulations to ensure the safety of these kinds of
items for young children. Used cribs, gates, car seats, strollers, or toys may not meet
government safety standards. Be cautious about buying or accepting these used or
hand-me-down articles.</p>

<p><b>General Safety Tips</b></p>

<p>To prevent falls, cuts and other injuries to children, be attentive to a baby placed in
a grocery shopping cart.</p>

<p>Make sure children use helmets while riding their bicycle or playing sports to protect
against severe head injuries.</p>

<p>Be aware of the serious risk of injuries suffered by young children using back-yard
trampolines. Trampolines should not be considered toys.</p>

<p>Children have strangled while playing with window curtain and blind cords. Do not leave
blind or drapery cords hanging and do not put a crib or bed near a window with blind
cords. Tie, clip or fasten cords out of the reach of children.</p>

<p>Use plastic safety covers over electrical outlets so children cannot poke metal objects
into them.</p>

<p>Use interior household paint that is suitable for children's products if you paint
children's furniture. </p>

<p>Choose only water-based arts and crafts materials for use by children.</p>

<p>Keep glass soft drink bottles away from children. If tipped or dropped, they may
explode and cause serious injury.</p>

<p>Make sure plastic bags are kept out of the reach of children. Children have suffocated
when playing with plastic bags.</p>

<p>Use children's wood sleighs that are equipped with a rigid handle. In some cases, wood
sleighs with a flexible rope as a handle do not provide enough control and can tip over
without the knowledge of the adult pulling the sleigh.</p>

<p>It is important to remain alert when travelling or visiting family and friends,
especially during holiday celebrations or while vacationing away from home.</p>

<p>To avoid childhood burns, falls, drownings and strangulation hazards, supervise your
child with loving care.</p>
