<p>Fever </font></p>

<p><b>What is a fever?</b></p>

<p>Fever means that the temperature of your body is more than normal. The normal
temperature is around 37c by rectum. Body temperature is measured with a thermometer which
you can buy at a drug store. Ask the pharmacist how to use it.</p>

<p>Take your child's temperature if he or she seems ill or feels hot to you. If your
child's temperature is more than 38.5c, you should take steps to bring the fever down. Do
not ignore a high fever. It can sometimes cause convulsions in small children.</p>

<p><b>What can you do?</b></p>

<p>Step 1: Give acetaminophen (Tylenol, Tempra, Pediaphen, etc.) as directed on the
bottle. This is the only medicine aimed directly at reducing fever. It will also help your
child rest more comfortably.</p>

<p>Give acetaminophen every four hours if necessary up to four doses in 24 hours; as long
as the child is taking enough fluids and continues to wet the diapers with urine.</p>

<p>Step 2: Tepid Sponging:</p>

<p>If the temperature is over 39c, bathe your child for 20 - 30 minutes in water that
feels neither hot nor cold to your touch. Do not use alcohol. Take the child out of the
water if he/she starts shivering. Check the temperature 1/2 hour after your child is
finished sponging. Repeat the sponging when necessary.</p>

<p>Step 3: Fluids. Give your child lots of cool, clear fluids to drink, such as flat coke
or ginger ale, juice, water, jello and popsicles. Do not worry if your child will not eat.
He will eat again when he feels better. </p>

<p>Step 4: Clothing. It is important not to put any heavy clothes on your child. If you
bundle him up, his fever will go up and he will feel uncomfortable. You must allow the
heat from his body to go into the air. Diapers and a light shirt will do. You may cover
him with a light sheet. </p>

<p><b>When should you call the doctor?</b></p>

<p>If your child still has a fever after a whole day, you should call the doctor for
advice. Fevers are caused by many different things and it is possible that the doctor will
want to examine your child.</p>

<p>Remember that some fevers are caused by viruses. There is no specific treatment for
this. Just continue what you have been doing to keep the fever down and make your child
more comfortable.</p>

<p>Remember...you should call the doctor right away if your child looks ill, has trouble
breathing, seems to be in a lot of pain, or has a convulsion.</p>

<p>Do not hesitate to call your doctor if you are worried or would like some advice.</p>
