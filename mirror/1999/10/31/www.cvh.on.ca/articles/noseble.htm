<p>Nosebleed Instructions </font></p>

<p>Nosebleeds can be caused by injuring a blood vessel in the nose with Q-tips,
fingertips, vigorous nose-blowing or injury to the nose. Carefully follow these
instructions and your nose should heal quickly. </p>

<p>Do not pick your nose or insert anything into it (such as Q-tips or Kleenex). Do not
blow your nose with force. If you have to sneeze, do it through your open mouth.</p>

<p>If a gauze pack was put into your nose by the doctor, you will need to have a doctor
remove it in 24 hours. If part of the packing starts to come out of the nostril, either
cut it off or gently pack it back in. Do not pull it out.</p>

<p>On the first day, avoid stooping and any strenuous exertion. For the first 3-4 days,
elevate your head on 2 or 3 pillows when lying down.</p>

<p>On the second day, place a little Polysporin or Secaris ointment just inside your
nostril to soften the crusts that form after a nosebleed. Continue this for 7 days if the
nose was cauterized.</p>

<p>Avoid hot drinks and alcoholic beverages for 4 days.</p>

<p>Avoid smoking or taking Aspirin, Advil, Medipren for 7 days. (Tylenol can be used).</p>

<p>If constipated, take a good laxative and avoid straining.</p>

<p>Prevention: Prevent further nosebleeds by using a cool mist vapourizer at night or
increasing the moisture in your home with a humidifier. </p>

<p>Vaseline or Secaris ointment (available over the counter at the pharmacy) can be used
to keep the nose moist as well.</p>

<p>If the bleeding starts again:</p>

<p>Sit up with your head slightly forward and squeeze the lower soft half of your nose
just below the hard bone with your thumb and index fingers. Hold for 10 to 15 minutes
without letting go.</p>

<p>If this fails, you may also insert a moistened cotton with Otrivin spray (available at
the pharmacy) inside both nostrils and apply pressure for 10 to 15 minutes as above.</p>

<p>If the bleeding continues, see your family doctor or return to the emergency
department.</p>
