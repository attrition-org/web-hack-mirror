<p>Knee Exercises </font></p>

<p><b>These exercises are designed to strengthen the muscles around the knee. They will
also increase range of motion.</b></p>

<p>Tighten the muscle in front of the thigh, pushing the back of the knee down in to the
floor and pull up the foot. A small rolled towel can be placed under the knee. </p>

<p>Push thigh down. Pull up foot. Lock knee. Lift leg slowly 10&quot; off bed. Hold. Lower
slowly. Repeat. </p>

<p>Bend affected knee, sliding heel up the bed as far as possible, straighten. Circle in
air 5x clockwise and 5x counter clockwise. Make a &quot;T&quot; in air. Keep toes facing
up. </p>

<p>While on stomach, bend affected leg up as far as it will go. Cross ankles placing
unaffected leg behind good leg. Gently push affected leg further. Hold. Relax. In same
position, squeeze ankles together. Hold and repeat. Now cross ankles the opposite way and
repeat. Do this in varying degrees of knee bend. </p>

<p>With both knees straight, tuck your toes under and straighten knee. Hold and repeat. </p>

<p>Lying on your side with the bottom knee bent, lift the tip leg up and down. Slowly
keeping knee straight and foot pulled up with leg in line with the body. </p>

<p>Place your heel on a table or object which is about waist height or at a comfortable
height. Keep the leg that is raised straight and the one on the ground slightly bent with
the foot pointed forward. Slowly bend forward until you feel a stretch in the back of the
raised leg. Hold and repeat. </p>

<p>Sit on edge of bed with leg straight and other leg over edge of bed. Bring chest
towards thigh until a stretch is felt. Hold position and repeat. </p>

<p>Stand about 1 foot from a solid support and lean against it with your arm for balance.
Bend your affected leg up behind you and grasp it with the opposite hand. Gently pull your
heel towards your body. Hold the stretch and repeat several times a day. </p>
