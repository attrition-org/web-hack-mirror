<p>Vomiting and Diarrhea Guidelines - Children </font></p>

<p>The first day: </p>

<p>Your child will need extra fluids to drink to prevent dehydration.</p>

<p>You should give your child lots of water and sugar-free fruit drinks.</p>

<p>Pedialyte or Gastrolyte (available at the pharmacy) is an excellent fluid replacement.</p>

<p>Give liquids in frequent, small amounts to avoid vomiting it back up. (1 or 2
tablespoons, every 10-15 minutes).</p>

<p>If you are breastfeeding continue to breastfeed as often as possible.</p>

<p>If your baby is taking formula, this may need to be stopped or changed. Ask the doctor.</p>

<p>Do not give your child excessive fruit drinks, apple juice, soft drinks, jello, tea,
boullion, popsicles, or sugar water. The higher sugar content can make diarrhea worse or
last longer.</p>

<p>The next few days:</p>

<p>If your child's vomiting has stopped, gradually return your child to his or her normal
diet.</p>

<p>Continue to breastfeed your baby.</p>

<p>Formula fed infants not on solid food yet may have formula diluted with equal parts
water (1/2 strength). By day 2, regularly diluted formula (full strength) may be given.</p>

<p>Infants and children who normally eat solid foods may now be fed: Rice pablum or
cereal, plain meat, plain potato, rice or pasta, white toast/bread with margarine, plain
vegetables, milk and formula. Fruit juice and soft drinks can be mixed 1 part juice/soft
drink to 2 parts water. Do not give any fruits, sweet desserts, and commercially prepared
soups during these early stages. Please note: your child should be eating a normal diet
(with minimal restrictions) 3-4 days after the vomiting or diarrhea started. At this time,
give frequent smaller meals (5-6 small meals/day) to ensure normal nutrition. It is normal
for diarrhea to continue for 4-7 days.</p>

<p>Diet which is not recommended: Do not give only bananas, rice, applesauce or apple
juice, or tea and toast to infants and children with diarrhea. This diet is poor in
vitamins and minerals and does not ensure recovery.</p>

<p>Return immediately if: 

<ol>
  <li>Diarrhea or vomiting increases; there is blood in the stool or the vomited material is
    bloody or green. </li>
  <li>Your child is not drinking enough fluids and has signs of water loss, including
    listlessness, dry mouth, excessive thirst, little or no urination, or wrinkled skin. </li>
  <li>Your child is overly drowsy or confused. </li>
  <li>Your child develops sharp or constant abdominal pain, painful or frequent urination,
    laboured breathing or a severe cough. </li>
  <li>Your child develops a temperature over 102 F or 39 C.</li>
</ol>
