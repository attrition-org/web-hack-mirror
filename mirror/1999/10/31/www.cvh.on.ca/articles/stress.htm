<p>Stress is a part of everyone's life. It is the physical, mental and chemical reactions
that occur in your body when you are under pressure. You experience stress when your body
is responding to something that frightens, excites, confuses, threatens, or annoys you.
Stress affects all body systems. Symptoms of stress are: blushing when embarrassed,
gritting teeth, breathing heavily, pounding heart, tight feeling in chest, loss of
appetite, weight in pit of stomach, clenching fists, sweating palms, nervousness,
trembling, dizziness, inability to relax, abnormal eating habits. </p>

<p>Everybody feels some of these signs of stress when they are under pressure, and that is
quite normal. Sometimes, however, these signs continue for a long time, or they occur for
no apparent reason. If this happens, other symptoms may develop and lead to illness. It is
important to pay attention to stress before it becomes an illness. Learn to recognize the
symptoms. </p>

<p>Events and situations that cause stress are called stressors. These events include
getting married, losing a job, being sick, going on vacation, and getting divorced. Even
normal day-to-day activities can be stressors. Stress can be pressures from outside - from
your home, job, or environment. If can also be the pressure you put on yourself. Not very
stressor is bad. Some stress is necessary, even good for you. However, any stressor - good
or bad - becomes harmful when it doesn't go away. </p>

<p>To see more clearly what your stressors are, you may want to list them. Divide your
list into three groups: stressors you cannot change; stressors you can change by yourself;
and stressors that involve other people. Communication is the key to reducing stressors
that involve others. Talk with the person who is involved in the problem. Just
&quot;getting it out in the open&quot; may lessen your tension. </p>

<p>Good physical health is one aid in controlling stress. Because a large part of your
stress reaction is physical, being fit can help you to deal with stress. You can stay fit
by getting enough rest and exercise, eating a well-balanced diet, and avoiding harmful
substances. </p>

<p><b>Rest</b> - Get a good night's sleep each night. Learn to relax during the day. Spend
some part of each day doing something you enjoy. Take holidays and vacations. </p>

physical recreation each day, such as walking, running, swimmming, or playing tennis. If
you are starting a new exercise program, check with your doctor first. </p>

<p><b>Diet</b> - Another way to help your body to deal with stress is to eat a
well-balanced, nutritious diet. Include the major food groups - meat, bread and cereals,
fruits and vegetables, and milk products - in each meal. Your body needs good nutrition,
especially when you are under stress. In general, you should eat: less refined sugar; less
fat; non-meat sources of protein, such as fish and poultry; more fruits and vegetables;
more whole-grain breads and cereals. Check with your doctor to find out your ideal weight.
Try to reach it and maintain it. </p>

<p><b>Avoiding Harmful Substances</b> - To to avoid abusing your body with drugs, even if
they seem to help at first. Smoking puts an added strain on your heart and lungs. It can
also lead to other illnesses. Although you may thinkg alcohol helps you relax, heavy
drinking doesn't help stress. If can lead to additional problems, such as alcoholism.

sedatives without medical supervision. They may hide the symptoms and cause additional
problems, such as drug dependency. </p>

can also cope with stress by keeping fit emotionally. Examine your lifestyle. Learn to act
in ways that lessen the number of stressful situations you must face. Try the following
steps: Know your own strengths and weaknesses. Get involved in things that you are
comfortable doing. Avoid things which are unpleasant for you; Do work that you are capable
of doing, that you really enjoy, and that other people appreciate; Try to do something
nice for someone else each day; Don't have to have the final word. Don't be hard on
yourself by always trying to show that you are right. Put ideas and events in a different
perspective. Say &quot;I prefer finishing this job&quot; instead of &quot;I must get this
job done&quot;; Take things one at a time. Try to complete one task before going on to the
next one. Make a list of tasks to be done. Decide in which order you want to do these
tasks. Take time off between tasks. Don't feel guilty when you don't complete what you
planned to do. Learn by your mistakes; There are many other methods that can help you to
cope with stress. These include relaxation techniques, meditation, biofeedback and
hypnosis.</p>

<p><b>Relaxation Techniques</b> - Several relaxation techniques can be learned to help you
cope with everyday stress. One method is progressive relaxation. You tense and relax
different muscles in your body, one at a time. This helps you to recognize the muscle
tension of stress and teaches you how to relax. There are also breathing exercises that
can help you relax. For instance: breathe in through your nose, letting your stomach
muscles expand; breathe out through your mouth, allowing your stomach muscles to contract;
relax and repeat. </p>

<p><b>Meditation</b> - Meditation is a technique in which you fix your attention firmly on
a given object or task for increasing periods of time. This keeps your mind from going
from one subject to another. It is very relaxing. Here are some ways to meditate: walk
slowly and try to relax. Pay attention to your breathing, to your body as it moves, and to
your heartbeat; sit quietly with your eyes closed, and chant one word out loud. Use
&quot;calm&quot; or another soft word. Listen to yourself as you say it; sit quietly with
your eyes closed, and reflect on a favorite object. If you drift away from your thought,
come back to it. Really enjoy the mental picture. </p>

only by a qualified person. Ask your doctor to recommend someone. </p>

stress. Your physician may also be able to help. You should have a complete physical
examination regularly. At that time, you should tell your doctor about all of your
problems - both physical and emotional. Your doctor may recommend that you see a
specialist to help you cope with stress. Other people, such as employers or school
advisers, could also suggest places to seek help for dealing with stress. </p>
