<p>Alcohol And Drug Treatment Program </font></p>

<p>Chemical dependency is a chronic biopsychosocial illness which has a multitude of
adverse effects on the individual as well as society. Our goal is to provide effective,
personalized, cost efficient assessment and treatment services for those clients suffering
from this serious disorder.</p>

<p>We strongly believe that the majority of chemically dependent clients do best when they
are treated in their own community in an outpatient setting. This allows them to integrate
the skills they have learned into their lives on an ongoing basis. As much as possible, we
attempt to structure a treatment program around the needs of the individual. We also
believe that there is no quick fix for a serious addiction problem. Long-term, regular
follow-up is vital to successful recovery.</p>

<p>Referrals are accepted from a wide variety of sources ranging from the client
themselves to specialized assessment agencies. All new referrals to the program are seen
initially by one of the program physicians to begin the assessment process and to screen
for related medical problems. Psychiatric consultation is available for those clients with
significant psychiatric problems. </p>

<p>People experiencing early stage problems with chemical dependency can obtain brief,
individualized counselling and education through the outpatient service. For appropriate,
motivated clients, a structured, controlled drinking program, based on the model developed
at the Addiction Research Foundation, can be offered. </p>

<p>The stage one (orientation) group, which meets on a weekly basis, allows ongoing
assessment of the client's treatment needs as well as stabilization in order to prepare
for optimal use of further treatment. Clients attending this group begin to develop
strategies and resources to cope with life's problems without the use of a psychoactive
medication. It is held in the late afternoon to facilitate attendance by working clients.
Attendance at stage one is a prerequisite for further treament in stage two. </p>

<p>Stage two (day treatment) is designed for clients who have chosen complete abstinence
from drugs of abuse as a goal. Individuals attend stage two from 0830 to 1630 hours daily
for three consecutive weeks. Each client works closely with a primary therapist to develop
specific goals for their participation in the program, and to establish both follow-up
plans and appropriate linkages with community resources and self-help groups. Both medical
and psychiatric consultation is available to program participants as required. </p>

<p>Program members participate in structured groups that emphasize the development of
effective interpersonal communication, relaxation and problem-solving skills along with a
balanced approach concerning one's lifestyle. A group therapy component facilitates
initiation of the emotional changes required to support complete abstinence, along with a
lifestyle focused on wellness. A separate group for men and women is designed to help
identify and work through gender-related issues pertinent to addiction. </p>

<p>Stage three (recovery group) is an essential component of the program allowing clients
who have completed stage two to consolidate the gains they have made in treatment. The
recovery group meets weekly for a two year period to help the client with their ongoing
recovery work. Part of this work involves planning an individualized relapse prevention
program with defined objectives and criteria for progression. Clients who have completed
inpatient programs at other facilities may be eligible to attend recovery group on a space
available basis. They will first be required to undergo an assessment process to confirm
their suitability for this group. </p>

<p>Families with a chemically dependent member often experience intense stress, isolation
and difficulty coping with problems. The client recovering from addiction has a much
greater chance of long term success if their family has some understanding of the problem.
Our program offers a family day during each cycle of day treatment, where family or close
friends of the client learn about the illness and the role that they can play in recovery.
This educational experience is also offered to those whose family member or close friend
is not currently involved in treatment. </p>

<p>Self-help programs are an important source of support and assistance for those
experiencing difficulties with alcohol or drugs. Alcoholics Anonymous, Al-Anon, Alateen
and Narcotics Anonymous offer regular group meetings at The Credit Valley Hospital. </p>
