<p>Amphetamines </font></p>

<p>Drug Class: Central Nervous System Stimulants</p>

<p><b>Synopsis</b></p>

<p>Amphetamines and amphetamine-related drugs are central nervous system stimulants whose
actions resemble those of adrenaline, one of the body's natural hormones.</p>

<p>The most important of these stimulants are the original drug, amphetamine, and its
close chemical relations, methamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Only the latter, under
the trade name Dexedrine, is legally manufactured in Canada today. Everything else is
synthesized in illicit &quot;basement&quot; laboratories.</p>

<p>Amphetamine was first introduced in the 1930s as a remedy for nasal congestion. Later,
all three drugs were found to be effective in treating such other conditions as
hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (uncontrollable sleeping fits). Although they
were also prescribed to control obesity and depression, their use for these disorders has
been discontinued because patients became quickly and seriously dependent.</p>

<p>The amphetamines have long been taken for their stimulant and euphoric effects. When
they were easily available in Canada, truck drivers, students, and athletes were among
those who used them extensively to prolong their normal periods of wakefulness and
endurance.</p>

<p>Among street drug users, injectable methamphetamine, usually called &quot;speed&quot;,
has been the most popular of this group of drugs because the &quot;high&quot; is more
rapid and intense than when the drug is taken orally. There is a smokable form of
methamphetamine, known on the street as &quot;ice&quot;.</p>

<p>Other street names for these drugs are bennies, glass, crystal, crank, pep pills, and
uppers.</p>

<p>Amphetamine misuse has declined dramatically since the near epidemic between 1950 and
1970. At the same time, however, there has been a marked increase in the use of such other
stimulants as cocaine. As well, drugs related to amphetamine - such as MDA, PMA, TMA and
STP - have appeared on the street.</p>

<p><b>Appearance</b></p>

<p>Illicit amphetamine appears as crystals, chunks, and fine to coarse powders, off-white
to yellow in color, and supplied loose (in plastic or foil bags) or in capsules or tablets
of various sizes and colors. The drug may be sniffed, smoked, injected, or taken orally in
tablet or capsule form.</p>

<p><b>Effects</b></p>

<p>The effects of any drug depend on several factors: the amount taken at one time; the
user's past drug experience; the manner in which the drug is taken; the circumstances
under which the drug is taken (the place, the user's psychological and emotional
stability, the presence of other people, the simultaneous use of alcohol or other drugs,
etc.).</p>

<p>Amphetamines, like adrenaline, affect not only the brain but also the heart, lungs, and
many other organs.</p>

<p>Short-term effects appear soon after a single dose and disappear within a few hours or
days. At low doses, such as those prescribed medically, physical effects include loss of
appetite, rapid breathing and heartbeat, high blood pressure, and dilated pupils. Larger
doses may produce fever, sweating, headache, blurred vision, and dizziness. And very high
doses may cause flushing, pallor, very rapid or irregular heartbeat, tremors, loss of
coordination, and collapse. Deaths have been reported as a direct result of amphetamine
use. Some have occurred as a consequence of burst blood vessels in the brain, heart
failure, or very high fever.</p>

<p>The psychological effects of short-term use include a feeling of well-being and great
alertness and energy. With increased doses, users may become talkative, restless, and
excited and may feel a sense of power and superiority. They may also behave in a bizarre,
repetitive fashion. Many become hostile and aggressive. Paradoxically, in children these
drugs frequently produce a calming effect and are often prescribed for hyperactivity.</p>

<p>Long-term effects appear soon after repeated use over a long period. With prolonged
amphetamine use, the short-term effects are exaggerated. Because amphetamines specifically
suppress appetite, chronic heavy users generally fail to eat properly and thus develop
various illnesses related to vitamin deficiencies and malnutrition. Users may also be more
prone to illness because they are generally run down, lack sleep, and live in an unhealthy
environment. Chronic heavy users may also develop amphetamine psychosis - a mental
disturbance very similar to paranoid schizophrenia. The psychosis condition is an
exaggeration of the short-term effects of high doses; the symptoms usually disappear
within a few days or weeks after drug use is stopped.</p>

<p>Heavy users of amphetamines may be prone to sudden, violent, and irrational acts. These
result from drug-induced self-centredness, distortions of perception, and delusions that
other people are threatening or persecuting them. The deviant lifestyle of many users may
increase the likelihood of such behaviour. In one Canadian study, violence (either
accidental, self-inflicted, or perpetrated by others) was the leading cause of
amphetamine-related deaths. Violent death was at least four times as common among regular
users of amphetamines as among non-users of the same age and sex.</p>

<p>As as way of coping with undesired amphetamine effects, users may turn to other
dependence-producing drugs. Depressant drugs, particularly barbiturates, alcohol, and
opiates, may be used to aid sleep or compensate for overdose. Thus users risk, in turn,
addiction to these drugs as well.</p>

<p>Infections from unsterile needles are not unusual among users who inject the drug. Some
infections are passed from user to user via shared needles. Hepatitis, for example, is
common among speed users wno regularly employ a needle; AIDS (acquired immune deficiency
syndrome) may spread in the same way.</p>

<p>Amphetamine products often contain substances that do not easily dissolve in water.
When users inject the drug, these particles can pass into the body and block small blood
vessels or weaken the blood vessel walls. Kidney damage, lung problems, strokes, or other
tissue injury may result.</p>

<p><b>Tolerance and Dependence</b></p>

<p>Regular use of amphetamines induces tolerance to some effects, which means that more
and more of the drug is required to produce the desired effects. Tolerance does not
develop to all effects at the same rate, however; indeed, there may be increased
sensitivity to some of them.</p>

<p>Chronic users may also become psychologically dependent on amphetamines. Psychological
dependence exists when a drug is so central to a person's thoughts, emotions, and
activities, that the need to continue its use becomes a craving or compulsion. Experiments
have shown that animals, when given a free choice, will readily operate pumps that inject
them with cocaine or amphetamine. Animals dependent on amphetamines will work hard to get
more of the drug.</p>

<p>Physical dependence occurs when the body has adapted to the presence of the drug, and
withdrawal symptoms occur if its use is stopped abruptly. The most common symptoms of
withdrawal among heavy amphetamine users are fatigue, long but troubled sleep,
irritability, intense hunger, and moderate to severe depression, which may lead to
suicidal behaviour. Fits of violence may also occur. These disturbances can be temporarily
reversed if the drug is taken again.</p>

<p><b>Amphetamines and Pregnancy</b></p>

<p>Little research has been done in humans into the effects of amphetamine use on
pregnancy and fetal growth. Experiments with animals suggest, however, that use during
pregnancy may produce adverse behavioural effects, such as hyperexcitability, in
offspring. And among humans, several cases have been documented of withdrawal symptoms
among newborn infants of mothers using amphetamines.</p>

<p><b>Other Stimulants</b></p>

<p>In the past few years, there has been increasing use of nasal decongestants for their
relatively mild stimulant properties. Various combinations of ephedrine,
phenylpropanolamine (PPA), and caffeine are often misrepresented as &quot;speed&quot; or
are sold in capsules that resemble those of legally manufactured amphetamines; these are
called &quot;look-alike&quot; stimulants. Taken in doses high enough to stimulate the
central nervous system, these drugs (especially when used in combinations) can produce
such side effects as high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, and agitation. Death due to
stroke have been reported following massive doses of look-alike combinations or of a
related decongestant, propylhexadrine.</p>

<p><b>Who Uses Stimulants</b></p>

<p>In the past, amphetamines were widely used medically to treat depression, obesity, and
a variety of other conditions. Stringent government controls, however, have restricted
their medical use in Canada to a small number of conditions, including Parkinson's
disease, narcolepsy, and attention deficit disorder (hyperactivity) in children. Other
drugs with similar chemical structures and effects - but said by their manufacturers to be
different from amphetamines - have some popularity as appetite suppressants.</p>

<p>A 1989 Addiction Research Foundation survey of Ontario students in grades 7 to 13 found
that 6.5% reported non-medical use of stimulants (other than cocaine) at least once during
the preceding year. Among students aged 16 and 17, the rate of use was higher at 9%. It is
believed that many of these students were consuming caffeine ephedrine, and PPA in the
form of amphetamine look-alikes or caffeine in over-the-counter stimulants.</p>

<p><b>Stimulants and the Law</b></p>

<p>Amphetamines are controlled drugs under Schedule G of Canada's Food and Drugs Act and
are legally available only on prescription. Diethylpropion, an amphetamine-like drug
contained in diet pills (e.g. Tenuate), became a controlled drug in 1978 after reports of
mounting abuse. All drugs listed under Schedule G are restricted at the manufacturing and
distribution stages. Anyone convicted of trafficking in these drugs or possessing them for
the purpose of trafficking is guilty of an offence that, if tried by indictment, carries a
maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.</p>

<p>Ephedrine and PPA are listed under Schedule C of the Food and Drugs Act, and are thus
available in combination products without prescription.</p>

<p>It is illegal to obtain a prescription for amphetamines or any other controlled drug
from health care professionals without notifying them that you have obtained a similar
prescription through another practitioner within the preceding 30 days.</p>

<p>Possessing amphetamines or other controlled drugs does not constitute an offence.</p>
