<p><b>NEWS FROM THE VALLEY CORNFIELD PHARMACENTRE</b></p>

<p>Anti-oxidants are substances that may reduce the risk of developing cancer and heart
disease. The anti-oxidants most commonly used include beta carotene, vitamins C and E and
selenium. Anti-oxidants help control and prevent free radicals (a radical is a compound or
element with an unpaired electron. They are highly reactive, unstable by-products which
have the potential to cause damage to cell structures). The human body has defences to
remove radicals generated by biochemical processes in the body, but when radicals are
formed in excess of the ability of anti-oxidants to remove them, a condition of
&quot;oxidative stress&quot; develops and cell damage follows. Beta carotene, vitamin C,
vitamin E and selenium are important because they neutralize the damaging effects of free
radicals and other reactive chemical entities produced by the body.</p>

<p>In addition to a healthy diet, a healthy lifestyle (exercise, no smoking, moderate
alcohol intake, avoiding saturated fats) will minimize the risk of developing heart
disease and cancer.</p>

<p><b>Quick Tip</b></p>

<p>In healthy adults, vitamin C is eliminated from the body within a 12 hour period. If
you take large doses of vitamin C (&gt;500 mg), it is best to take half the dose in the
morning and half in the evening or choose a slow-release formulation.</p>
