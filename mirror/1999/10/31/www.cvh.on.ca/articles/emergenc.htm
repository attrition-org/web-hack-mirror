<p><b>Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup)</b></p>

<p>Croup is caused by a viral infection of the larynx (voice box) and the trachea (air
tube) just below the larynx. It often accompanies a cold and causes inflammation and
swelling of the larynx and trachea. This causes the common symptoms of croup, namely:
hoarseness, a barking type cough and difficulty taking in a breath. The harsh, vibrating
noise that a child makes as they take a breath in is called stridor. In more severe cases,
children will show pulling in or retraction of the tissues between the ribs or above the
breastbone when they take a breath in. Croup can last from 2 to 7 days and usually seems
to flare up at night.</p>

<p>Most often, croup resolves without any specific treatment. The use of lots of warm
fluids, acetaminophen (Tylenol, Tempra) every 4 hours as needed, and cool, humidified air
in the child's bedroom, are usually all that are required. During outbreaks of croup in
the spring and fall, your doctor may recommend 48 hours treatment with a cortisone type
drug such as Decadron or Prednisone, to decrease the inflammation of the trachea and
larynx.</p>

<p>If your child wakes up during the night, in distress, due to cough or stridor, try the
following:</p>

<p>Stay calm and try to calm your child.</p>

<p>Turn on the hot water taps in the bathroom and allow it to fill up with warm steam.</p>

<p>Sit with your child on your lap for 10 - 15 minutes in the steamy bathroom.</p>

<p>If this doesn't work try going outside for 5 - 10 minutes or for a short car ride with
the windows rolled partially down.</p>

<p>If this does not improve your child's breathing, bring them to the emergency
department.</p>

<p>Return to the Emergency Department immediately if: 

<ul>
  <li>Your child is having trouble breathing, cannot swallow water and is drooling.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Breathing increases to above 40 breaths per minute.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Bluish colouring of the lips or fingernails (cryanosis).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Your child develops retractions (pulling in) between the ribs which persist longer than
    10 minutes in a steamy room.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Your child develops a fever greater than 38.5 degrees C.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Cast Care</b></p>

<p>Casts should be checked 24 - 48 hours after they have been initially applied. In most
cases, this can be carried out by your own family physician. In some cases, an appointment
will be made for this to be carried out at our Fracture Clinic in the Ambulatory Care
Department of The Credit Valey Hospital.</p>

<p>Following the initial cast check, appointments may be required in order for your
physician to evaluate your recovery and eventually to remove your cast. These appointments
can be carried out either by your own family physician in his/her office or, in some cases
by the staff at The Credit Valley Hospital in our Fracture Clinic.</p>

<p>If you have been given instructions to return to your own family physician for cast
check and/or follow-up, please arrange this appointment yourself by calling your family
physician's office.</p>

<p>If it has been suggested that you return to the Fracture Clinic in the Ambulatory
Clinic Department for consultation with one of our Physicians, please make note of the
date and name of the physician who will be seeing you in the Clinic. This information will
be given to you before you leave the Emergency Department. You will then be contacted at
home, by telephone, within the next 24- 48 hours by the personnel in our Ambulatory Care
Department to confirm your specific appointment time and date.</p>

<p>General Instructions regarding cast care: 

<ul>
  <li>Please try to keep your cast dry at all times.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Do not allow pressure or weight bearing for 48 hours after the initial application of
    the cast.</li>
</ul>

<p>To diminish the chance of swelling, it is best to keep the casted limb elevated above
the level of your heart for at least the first 48 hours following application. </p>

<p><b>Neck Injury</b></p>

<p>The doctor who examined you has diagnosed a sprain/strain of the muscles and ligaments
of your neck. Most people have some pain and stiffness for 1- 3 weeks after such an
injury. It is usually the most severe in the first 48 hours. Less than 10% of people have
ongoing pain and stiffness longer than 8 - 10 weeks. To improve your chances of rapid
recovery, follow the simple principles below:</p>

<p>Rest: For the first 1 - 2 days, a soft neck collar (available at your pharmacy) or a
pillow collar (made by wrapping a soft pillow around your neck and fastening it together
at the front with safety pins) may provide some pain relief. Beyond 2 days, collars can
weaken the neck muscles and actually prolong your recovery. Maintain good neck posture by
tucking your chin in when you are upright and by using a small pillow or rolled up towel
to fill in the hollow of your neck when lying down.</p>

<p>Ice: Fill a zip-lock bag with crushed ice and some water, or use a bag of frozen peas.
Cover this with a wet towel or pillow case. Apply to the painful area of your neck for 10
- 15 minutes at a time. Repeat every 2 - 3 hours while awake for the first 24 - 48 hours.
Gently move your neck around after icing to stretch the muscles.</p>

<p>Heat: After 48 hours, begin heat application with hot, wet towels, a heating paid, a
hot water bottle, or by using a hot shower, for 10 - 15 minutes while you slowly start
moving your neck through all of its motions. Repeat every 3- 4 hours during the day.</p>

<p>Medication: Your doctor may have prescribed medicine to relieve pain and muscle spasm
over the next few days. These pills may make you quite drowsy at first. Be careful with
any activities where you have to be alert, such as driving, and avoid alcohol while on
this medication. Codeine products may upset your stomach or cause constipation. This can
usually be relieved by taking the pills after meals and by eating extra fibre such as bran
cereals, bran muffins, prunes or by taking a bulk laxative such as Metamucil. If you have
not been prescribed a pain-killer, an adult can take acetaminophen (Tylenol), 2 regular or
even 2 extra-strength tablets, every 4 hours for pain relief.</p>

<p>Activity: Recovery is faster in those people who start early, active neck movement.
Range of motion exercises are very important to decrease neck stiffness and maintain
normal movement. Until you see your own doctor for follow-up in 2 - 3 days, you should
gently stretch your neck in every direction at least 3 - 4 times daily. If this is too
painful sitting up, try doing it while lying down on your back. It may also help to apply
heat, as mentioned above, prior to movement. Your own doctor may refer you for early
physiotherapy to continue the active rehabilitation process.</p>

<p><b>See a doctor again immediately if any of the following occur:</b> 

<ul>
  <li>You develop pain, tingling or numbness going down your arms or back.<br>
  </li>
  <li>You develop weakness or clumsiness in any part of your arms or legs.<br>
  </li>
  <li>You lose control of your bowels or bladder.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Your pain continues to get worse in spite of rest, ice and acetaminophen.</li>
</ul>
