        is a disease which makes it difficult or impossible for a person's body to properly use
        glucose, a form of sugar. <p>During digestion food is broken down into glucose which is
        used by the body to create energy. This process is called metabolism. </p>
        <p>A person with Diabetes cannot convert this glucose into useable energy because their
        body either cannot produce enough insulin or cannot use the insulin it produces. This
        results in glucose building up in the bloodstream. </p>
        <p>Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas(a gland near the stomach). Insulin
        regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates by controlling the entry of glucose into the
        cells of the body. Without insulin, glucose cannot be transported into the cells to be
        used for energy. </p>
        <p>There currently is no cure for diabetes but it can be controlled. The type of treatment
        depends on the type of diabetes a person has. </font></td>

    Blood Sugar), results when people who take insulin or oral medication do not have enough
    glucose in their body in comparison to the amount of medication. </p>
    <p>The reason behind this imbalance is usually because the person didn't eat enough food,
    the food was not eaten soon enough or too much medication was taken. </p>
    <p>This condition must be treated quickly with sugar, sugary foods or fruit juice,
    otherwise, in extreme situations if left untreated, the person could become unconscious. </p>

    to have very high blood sugar (Hyperglycemia) s/he should treat the condition or see a
    doctor. <p>If left untreated, the body does not have enough insulin to use the high
    amounts of sugar and so the person's body begins to use the enrgy from its own stored
    fats. </p>
    <p>As these fats are broken down, acids called &quot;ketones&quot; are formed in the body.
    </p>
    <p>If too many ketones are formed the person with Diabetes can fall into a coma. This
    condition can be fatal. A diabetic coma mostly occurs with Type 1 diabetes. </p>
    <p>In order for that dangerous level of ketones to develop it usually takes several hours
    or days. </p>
    <p>The dangerous end result can be averted if a person with Diabetes pays attention to the
    early symptoms which often are the following: </p>
