<p>Baby care </font></p>

<p><b>My baby's stools seem to be changing colour. What are they supposed to look like?</b></p>

<p>A baby's first stool is sticky, black and odourless. &quot;Transitional&quot; stool may
be greenish black, greenish brown, brownish yellow, greenish yellow or yellow. If loose it
may also contain mucus.</p>

<p>Breast-fed baby: After the first week the stool will become yellow, semi-formed and
curdy.</p>

<p>Bottle-fed baby: After the first week the stool will become paler yellow or brownish
yellow, more formed and drier.</p>

<p><b>How will I know when my baby is sick?</b></p>

<p>It is normal for babies to have fussy periods at some time during the day. The actual
time of day for these periods differs from baby to baby. If your baby feels unusually
warm, has flushed cheeks and is irritable or lethargic, he/she may have a mild fever.
Often this is not serious, and extra fluids and a lukewarm bath may be all that is
necessary to settle the baby and bring his/her temperature down to normal.</p>

<p>Call your physician if the baby has:</p>

<p>Temperature 38.5C (101.3F) or higher<br>
Temperature persistently lower than normal<br>
Diarrhea<br>
Vomiting spells<br>
Persistent rash<br>
Persistent change in feeding pattern<br>
Lethargy or prolonged irritability<br>
Baby looks ill (eyes do not look interested, colour is pale)<br>
High-pitched cry along with above symptoms</p>

<p>If your baby has a seizure, summon medical help immediately.</p>

<p><b>When should I start to use a car seat for my baby?</b></p>

<p>Immediately! Babies should be transported home from the hospital in a car seat. These
safety seats are available for children of all ages and sizes.</p>

<p><b>Proper Seats</b></p>

<p>The correct seats protect critical areas and absorb shock forces in a collision. The
rear-facing infant seat is the only safe seat for children under 9kg (20lbs). Note: Make
sure that the car seat meets government standards and be very careful to install it
according to the manufacturer's instructions, information pamphlets are available from
Transport Canada.</p>

<p><b>Why did my baby lose weight a few days after birth?</b></p>

<p>It is normal for babies to lose up to ten per cent of their birth weight shortly after
they are born, as they lose the extra fluid which was in their systems at birth.</p>

<p>Most babies start gaining weight within the first week if they are feeding well.</p>

<p><b>I would like to go out with my husband/partner, but I feel guilty about leaving my
baby. What should I do?</b></p>

<p>You will probably find it difficult to allow someone else to care for your baby - this
is a normal reaction. However, you need time for yourself, and your baby needs to develop
trust in other care-giving adults.</p>

<p>Besides being fed, a new baby needs to feel loved and secure and, in your temporary
absence, a babysitter can provide these needs. Be sure that you: 

<ul>
  <li>Find a babysitter whom you trust, a family member or friend;<br>
  </li>
  <li>Leave explicit instructions for the sitter detailing where you can be reached, with
    emergency telephone numbers or emergency procedures.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also feel better if you call home to see how your baby is doing. With this
reassurance, you will be able to relax and enjoy the outing.</p>

<p><b>Making your home safe for children</b></p>

<p>Your new baby's safety depends completely upon you and the rest of the family. Since
babies are unable to recognize dangers themselves, they must be protected from situations
and objects that may harm them. Parents constantly have to be aware of potentially
dangerous situations.</p>

<p>As your child grows, his/her needs will change. If you know how a child develops, you
will be able to anticipate behaviour that can lead to accidents. This list will help you
to recognize the growth pattern of your child and what he/she is capable of achieving.
Remember, accidents can be prevented!</p>

<p>1. Your newborn should: 

<ul>
  <li>Never be left unattended in a baby seat on a table or counter, or in a high-chair.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Never be left unattended on a couch or bed.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Never be left unattended with a toddler or jealous pet.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Never be left unattended with a propped bottle. Your baby may choke and should always be
    held when being fed.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. Your baby will soon learn to roll from side to side, therefore: 

<ul>
  <li>If left alone, he/she should be in a crib or playpen.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Both crib and playpen should meet safety standards as established by the Product Safety
    Branch, Consumers and Corporate Affairs Canada.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The crib should be away from blinds with long cords or dressers with objects he/she
    could reach.<br>
  </li>
  <li>No pillows should be used in crib or playpen.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A safety strap should be used when child is in a stroller, infant seat or high-chair.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. Your baby will soon learn to move his/her hand to his/her mouth and will try to eat
anything within reach, therefore: 

<ul>
  <li>Toys should be large, soft and without removable parts.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Pins, needles, diaper pins (closed), buttons, coins, marbles, jewellery. In fact all
    small objects, should be kept well beyond your baby's reach from either the crib or
    playpen.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Soothers and pacifiers should be of one-piece construction and large enough to prevent
    their being swallowed. Never put soothers on strings.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Plastic bags should be kept well out of reach to prevent any chance of suffocation.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Sharp objects such as scissors, knives and forks should be kept beyond your baby's reach
    from crib or playpen.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Never drink hot beverages or smoke while the baby is in your arms or on your lap.</li>
</ul>

<p>4. Your baby will soon learn to sit up, creep and pull himself/herself to a standing
position, therefore: 

<ul>
  <li>Guard rails or gates should be securely installed at the bottoms and tops of stairs as
    soon as he/she begins to crawl, and all windows should be securely screened.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Table lamps, vases, decorative objects and anything that can be toppled or pulled off
    counters or tabletops, should be stored away for the time being.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Never leave the iron on the ironing board (turned on or off).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Pots on stove should be on the back burners with handles turned in towards the centre,
    and electric kettle cords should be kept well away from the front of the counter or table.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Containers of hot liquid should be kept out of reach, and your baby should never be
    allowed near a hot oven.<br>
  </li>
  <li>All electrical outlets not in use should be covered with safety cones, and all extension
    cords disconnected.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Medicines, hair sprays, cosmetics, poisonous materials, household cleaning/polishing
    liquids and solids must be in a locked safe place (i.e. out of reach), and soft-drink
    bottles should never be used to store gasoline or caustic substances. Keep all medication
    and chemicals in child-resistant containers.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Do not offer food that, if not chewed property, could cause your child to choke (food
    such as nuts, raw carrots, orange segments, hot dogs, bacon or hard candles that could be
    swallowed whole).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Determine if any of your house plants are poisonous and dispose of those that are. Some
    of the common poisonous varieties include: castor-bean seeds, dieffenbachia, caladium,
    some philodendrons, elephant's ears, bulbs of hyacinth, narcissus and daffodils,
    rosary-pea seeds, holly berries, jerusalem cherries, mistletoe berries and poinsettias.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Be aware of objects that your child might climb, such as step-stools, ladders or large
    toys.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Keep your child away from potentially dangerous appliances or equipment such as lawn
    mowers, washers, dryers, woodworking tools and machinery.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Caution:</b> Water is hazardous. Never leave your child alone in a bath or paddling
pool, near backyard pools, open ditches or ponds. Check the temperature of the bath water
and use only cold-water vaporizers in the house.</p>

<p>To help you see potential dangers in your home, crawl on your hands and knees and judge
for yourself what hazards your baby could encounter.</p>
