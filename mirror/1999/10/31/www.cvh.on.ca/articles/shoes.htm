<p>What To Look For When Buying Shoes </font></p>

<p>Laces or Velcro straps to prevent the foot from sliding in the shoe and to secure the
shoe to the foot; they also allow adjustment for normal swelling as the day progresses.
Strong heel counter to cup and support the heel and help stabilize the foot. Soles made of
flexible, cushioned, non-slip material to absorb shock and provide good traction. Low
heels (under 1 1/2 inches) with a broad base for stability to distribute your weight as
evenly as possible over the entire foot. Rounded or squared toes to allow room for the
natural shape of the forefoot. Enough depth in the toe area for the toes to fit
comfortably without rubbing. No seams or wrinkles on the inside of the shoe upper or
insoles which can rub and cause blisters or irritations. Uppers (the top part of the shoe)
made of natural breathable or vented materials to prevent a build-up of moisture within
the shoe. </p>

<p>Fitting tips: 

<ul>
  <li>The heel should fit snugly - if you can fit a finger behind the back of your heel, it is
    too loose; </li>
  <li>Allow a thumb's width of extra length at the toes to give them plenty of room; </li>
  <li>Place the shoe on a table and bend it at the ball - the sole should be flexible at this
    point to allow the foot to bend as you walk; Have both feet measured to determine your
    shoe size - buy the size for the biggest foot; </li>
  <li>Buy shoes at the end of the day when your feet are biggest. Only buy shoes that are
    comfortable in the shoe store - avoid buying shoes that the salesperson says &quot;will
    stretch&quot;.</li>
</ul>
