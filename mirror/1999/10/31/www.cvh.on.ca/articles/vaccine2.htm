<p>What are Tetanus and Diphtheria? </font></p>

<p>Tetanus or lockjaw results when wounds are infected with tetanus bacteria which often
live in soil. It causes the muscles of the body to go into spasms. Six out of every ten
people who get tetanus will die.</p>

<p>Diphtheria is a very serious disease which can cause an infection in the nose and
throat and can interfere with breathing. Sometimes it causes heart failure and paralysis.</p>

<p><b>What are the benefits of the vaccine?</b></p>

<p>DT or Td vaccine will control these diseases. Td is two vaccines combined into one and
can be given to school children and adults. Several doses are needed with a booster every
ten years.</p>

<p>The tetanus vaccine is 95% effective in preventing the disease. DT is available for
pre-school children who are unable to have pertussis (whopping cough) vaccine.</p>

<p><b>How often is vaccination required?</b></p>

<p>Several doses are needed - three doses in the first year of life and a fourth dose at
18 months of age. A booster is important for children 4 - 6 years old. Booster doses every
ten years are required throughout adulthood.</p>

<p><b>Are there reasons for an individual to not get the vaccine?</b> 

<ul>
  <li>Illness more serious than a cold.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Serious reaction to previous vaccination.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Allergies to thimerosal or aluminum phosphate.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>What are the possible reactions to the vaccine?</b></p>

<p>Local - redness and tenderness at site of injection. A small painless nodule may
develop but usually disappears in two months.</p>

<p>General - slight fever and irritability within a day or two of receiving the shot.</p>

<p>Please note: If a person who received the vaccine gets sick and visits a doctor,
hospital or clinic in the four weeks following vaccination, please report it to the Health
Department at 791-9400, ext. 424.</p>
