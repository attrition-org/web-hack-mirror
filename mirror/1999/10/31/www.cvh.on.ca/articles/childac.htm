<p>Prevention of Childhood Accidents </font></p>

<p>Health promotion is the prevention of illness and injury. It's your choice to stay
healthy. Be informed. Make your own decision. Wear protective gear. Take smart risks.</p>

<p>1. Ensure your immunizations are up to date. Tetanus Diphtheria vaccines are required
every 10 years in adults.<br>
2. Use seat belts and approved tethered infant and child seats.<br>
3. Wear your bike helmet and be a role model.<br>
4. Be aware of the effects of drugs and alcohol.<br>
5. Poisoning proof your home.<br>
6. Know when to call your doctor.<br>
7. If you are on any kind of medication ensure you carry it with you and you know why you
are taking it!</p>

<p>Remember, be informed. The choice to stay healthy is yours.</p>

<p><b>Bike Helmet Safety</b></p>

<p>1. In October of 1995 bicycle helmet use became law.<br>
2. Bicycle helmets reduce the incidence of head injury by 85 per cent.<br>
3. Look for a helmet that is approved by &quot;Snell&quot; or &quot;CSA&quot;.<br>
4. Only you can make the decision to wear a helmet. It's your life.<br>
5. Most accidents occur within a few blocks from home so wear your helmet!<br>
6. Everyone riding bicycles must know the rules of the road.<br>
7. The bicycle must be the right size for the rider and in good repair. (The rider's feet
should be able to touch the ground to allow control of the bicycle).<br>
8. Parents must be role models and wear their helmet while cycling.</p>

<p>What happens if you are in an accident and don't wear a helmet? Many people fracture
their skull (break the skull bone). Brain damage can occur in some cases. Remember! The
cost of caring for a head injured child over their lifetime is $1 million to $1.5 million.</p>

<p>For poison information, contact, The Hospital for Sick Children Poison Control at (416)
813-5900. You will be asked to provide the name of the substance (eg. medication, poison),
the time since the child or adult ate or drank it and the weight of the child or adult.</p>

<p><b>Home Safety Tips</b></p>

<p>1. Place medications out of the reach of small children. Children often explore purses
left at floor level.<br>
2. Cleaning supplies must be placed out of reach. Never mix cleaning supplies as a
dangerous gas may result.<br>
3. Plants can be poisonous (eg. poinsettia).<br>
4. Toys should be appropriate for the age of the child. Small pieces can cause choking!<br>
5. Ensure appliances such as irons don't have cords within the reach of small children.
Many burns happen as a result.<br>
6. Poison proof your bathroom - mouthwash contains alcohol!</p>

<p><b>Drive to stay alive!</b></p>

<p>1. Seatbelts decrease the chance of serious injury significantly.<br>
2. Never drive after drinking. Many of the accident victims that are seen in emergency
departments are there as a result of a drunk driver.<br>
3. Designate a driver if you plan to drink.<br>
4. It's your choice to get into a car. Make a smart choice. It's your life.<br>
5. Don't let your friends drive drunk. You may save their life!</p>
