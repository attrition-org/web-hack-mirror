<p align="center"><font color="#000080"><strong>New Mothers and Babies and The Credit
Valley Hospital:&nbsp; An Introduction</strong></font></p>
<font color="001058" size="5">

<p></font>The Credit Valley hospital program for obstetrics and newborn care has been
designed to meet the needs of our mothers before they deliver, during labour and after
they go home.</p>

<p>While The Credit Valley Hospital welcomes the recent announcement by Premier Harris to
enhance funding for new mothers and babies for hospital and public health services, the
option&nbsp; &quot;... to remain under hospital care for 60 hours after childbirth&quot;
cannot be guaranteed for mothers at all times. </p>

<p>At the present time, the capacity of our 30 bed obstetrical unit would not enable us to
accomodate all requests to stay 60 hours given the current volume of&nbsp; births,
approximately 4000 this&nbsp; year.&nbsp; The Ministry of Health has not approved any
expansion of our hospital to allow all mothers and babies to stay for 60 hours. </p>

<p>The length of stay after delivery is based on individual needs.&nbsp; The majority of
mothers are discharged after 24 hours following an uncomplicated vaginal delivery and
after 72 hours for an uncomplicated Caesarean birth.&nbsp; Follow-up assessment and
support is provided through a &quot;hotline&quot; telephone service, outpatient Postpartum
Support Clinic visits and linkage with public health services for home and community
supports. </p>

<p>The program is consistent with the belief that childbirth is a normal life event, and
that following a brief&nbsp; hospital stay which permits women to give birth in a safe
environment,&nbsp; most&nbsp; mothers and infants are&nbsp; healthy and can be cared for
in their own&nbsp; homes.&nbsp; By sending those families who are ready to be discharged
home at 24 hours, the hospital resources can be appropriately directed to those who
&nbsp;&nbsp; have more complex health&nbsp; needs and to our rapidly growing community. </p>

<p>Please discuss individual needs with your physician or,&nbsp; if you have any questions
regarding the Obstetrics program at The Credit Valley Hospital, please contact Nancy
Hardman, Nurse Manager, Postpartum and Maternal Services, at (905) 813-3941.<br>
