    <br>
    Thursday, August 26, 1999<br>
    <br>
    The physicians, staff and volunteers at The Credit Valley Hospital are mourning the loss
    of Richard S. Clewes, the first Chairman of the Hospital's Board. Dubbed &quot;a man for
    the '80s&quot; the late Mr. Clewes provided the leadership to ensure the Credit Valley
    Hospital was built and to lead the hospital's Board of Governors once the hospital opened
    to patients.<br>
    <br>
    Mr. Clewes knew time was of the essence in order to build a state of the art hospital to
    meet the needs of Mississauga's growing community in the 1980's. He was active in other
    community endeavors such as the Streetsville Bread and Honey Festival. In 1979 he combined
    his efforts for that event and the promotion of the new hospital by constructing a
    miniature hospital for a float for the festival's parade.<br>
    <br>
    Hospital President, Wayne Fyffe, said today, although he did not personally work with Mr.
    Clewes when he was Chairman of the Board, he knew him to be &quot;a man deeply committed
    to his community. It is a sad day for The Credit Valley Hospital as well as the past and
    present members of the Board of Governors. The community and hospital is forever in his
    debt for working tirelessly to make our hospital a reality.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jane Watson, the current Chairman of the Board echoed Mr. Fyffe's sentiments. &quot;Mr.
    Clewes was a determined and honorable man. He was well respected in our community and the
    right choice to lead the inaugural Board of Governors. We, the residents of the City of
    Mississauga and surrounding region, have benefited from his expertise and good
    judgement.Because of his efforts, The Credit Valley Hospital is the centre of excellence
    it is today. Our sincere condolences to the Clewes family.&quot;</p>

    Wanted To Participate In Major Breast Cancer Prevention Trial</b></a></p>
    <p>July 22, 1999</p>
    <p>Until a year ago, women with an increased risk of breast cancer had no proven way to
    reduce their chance of getting the disease. A new study is comparing Tamoxifen &#150; the
    drug that was found to reduce breast cancer by half a year ago with a newer drug called
    Raloxifene.</p>
    <p>The STAR study (the study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene) will determine which drug might
    be better and have fewer side effects for women past menopause who are at high risk of
    breast cancer. Healthy women interested in joining the STAR project will have their breast
    cancer risk calculated based on their age, family history of breast cancer, number of
    children, number or times she has had breast lumps biopsies, and other factors. </p>
    <p>Dr. Robert Myers is the medical director for oncology at The Credit Valley Hospital.
    The hospital is one of only five Ontario hospitals participating in the study.
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The study which will include more than 22,000 postmenopausal women associated
    with more than 400 centres across the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada. Dr. Myers
    encourages healthy women of all races and ethnic groups who think they are at increased
    risk for breast cancer to contact the STAR hotline at 905-813-4442. </p>
    <p>Tamoxifen was proven in the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial to reduce breast cancer
    incidence by 49 percent in women at increased risk of the disease. This drug was approved
    by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in
    women in October 1998.</p>
    <p>Raloxifene was shown to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in a large study of its
    use to prevent and treat osteoporosis. This drug was approved by the FDA to prevent
    osteoporosis in postmenopausal women in December 1997 and has been under study for about
    five years. </p>
    <p>Both Tamoxifen and Raloxifene have known side effects. Any women interested in
    participating in the trial will be fully informed of the benefits and potential risks of
    these drugs. The most common side effects of either drug are hot flashes and vaginal
    discharge. Serious side effects are known to occur in women taking Tamoxifen, namely
    endometrial cancer, blood clots in the leg or lung and possibly stroke. Blood clots are
    known to occur in women taking Raloxifene. </p>

    <p align="left"><font face="default">July 13, 1999</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="default">The Credit Valley Hospital is pleased to receive
    notice of a $1.5 million &quot;shot in the arm&quot; from Health Minister, Elizabeth
    Witmer.&nbsp; The money is an acknowledgement of growth pressures in the hospital's
    immediate catchment area.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="default">Hospital President, Wayne Fyffe, says the money will
    help, but falls dramatically short of covering the hospital's projected deficit of more
    than $6 million this year and does not recognize the ongoing financial pressures that will
    only be eliminated by a realistic base budget increase.&nbsp; Fyffe says even more
    importantly, the announcement does not take into account the results and recommendations
    of the recently released External Review of the hospital's operating status.&nbsp; The
    External Review was recommended following the Coroner's inquest into the death of young
    Kyle Martyn.&nbsp; During the course of the inquest, emphasis was placed on the
    overcrowded conditions and lack of funding related to the unprecedented growth in the
    hospital's immediate catchment area.&nbsp; The area has experienced a 48% growth in
    population over the last five years and will grow by an additional 32% by the year 2003.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="default">The External Review which was conducted by an
    independent consulting firm with representation from both the Ministry of Health and the
    hospital, determined that the Credit Valley Hospital is operated efficiently.&nbsp; The
    report says the hospital's problems stem from current and projected growth and determined
    that &quot;the hospital and the Ministry of Health must work together to deal with issues
    associated with growth, including interim and longer term physical capacity, funding and
    resources, impacts of provincial funding formulae, and program expansion.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="default">&quot;The hospital's financial position is expected
    to worsen, based on assumptions regarding growth of future revenues and expenses. &nbsp;
    The Ministry and the hospital need to deal with the projected financial situation so that
    the hospital can meet the cost pressures of growth.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="default">Fyffe says &quot;those pressures are creating a $
    million deficit every month of this fiscal year.&nbsp; We need a base budget increase that
    will recognize our patients' needs now and into the future.&nbsp; Short term solutions,
    such as the recently announced $1.5 million are nice, but not nearly enough.&quot;</font></p>

    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER"><a name="Warning: Dangerous Curves Ahead">Warning: Dangerous Curves
    Ahead</a></b></p>
    <p>June 17, 1999</p>
    <p>The road to health care at The Credit Valley Hospital has some dangerous curves ahead
    according to the hospital&#146;s year end statistics and future year projections. The
    hospital&#146;s operating volumes have increased dramatically in many programs and
    services. </p>
    <p>Mississauga and area has been in a state of rapid growth in the northwest section of
    Mississauga. The larger area served by CVH grew by 48% over the last five years. An
    additional 32% in growth is expected between now and the year 2003. </p>
    <p>The unprecedented growth has been causing serious problems for the hospital because the
    hospital&#146;s operating funds, most of which come from the Ministry of Health, have not
    kept pace with growth. Consequently, caregivers are trying to care for a dramatically
    increased patient load, with 1995 dollars. </p>
    <p>The impact of the growth, though felt in every part of the hospital, has been most
    evident in the Emergency Department where patients arrive unexpectedly with anything from
    broken bones to deadly viruses. The seriousness of patients&#146; conditions (acuity) has
    increased dramatically over the last few years. As a result, many of the emergency
    patients require admission to hospital. But the nursing units have few, if any, inpatient
    beds to spare. The lack of operating funds to provide the additional tests and drugs to
    care for the increasing patient load, coupled with the lack of capital funds to expand our
    inpatient space to add more beds, has pushed the hospital and its caregivers to the limit.
    Too often emergency patients end up waiting on stretchers in that department until a bed
    can be found on a nursing unit. </p>
    <p>Over the last year patients spent a total of 1977 days in the emergency department
    waiting for an inpatient bed. With only 365 days in a year, the statistic indicates how
    serious a lack of inpatient resources poses for the emergency department. Based on current
    population data, the hospital estimates patients could spend the equivalent of 3000
    patient days waiting in the ER for an inpatient bed this year. </p>
    <p>At the end of April the hospital received its initial Ministry of Health allocation for
    this fiscal year. &quot;It was disappointing to say the least,&quot; hospital president,
    Wayne Fyffe acknowledged. &quot;The interim allocation provides $1 million less than last
    year&#146;s funding.&quot; The 1998/99 operating budget, after additional transitional
    funding injections, was $83 million. The initial funding for the 1999/00 fiscal year will
    provide a budget of $82 million. The hospital says it needs an operating budget of $104
    million. That means the current funding from the Ministry of Health fall short by $22
    million. </p>
    <p>The Credit Valley Hospital is holding a Public Information Forum on Thursday, June 24<sup>th</sup>
    at 7 p.m. in its Skylight Restaurant to discuss:<ul>
      <li>Access to care</li>
      <li>And how our interim operating budget will impact our patients&#146; care.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We hope you&#146;ll be able to join us. </p>

    <p>The Credit Valley Hospital&#146;s Board of Governors unveiled the hospital&#146;s new
    Vision, Mission and Values statements at their annual meeting, held last Thursday, June
    10, 1999. The document is part of the hospital&#146;s revised Strategic Plan which was
    developed through the involvement of all segments of the organization over the past year. </p>
    <p>The strategic goals, which led to the overall theme of the Vision, Mission and Values
    statements took into consideration the hospital&#146;s enhanced regional role as the
    centre for oncology, renal dialysis, genetics and maternal and child health. The goals
    speak to expanded surgical services, and the implementation of all of the Health Services
    Restructuring Commission&#146;s recommendations over the next five years. The organization
    pledges to aggressively pursue a funding formula that considers rapid population growth
    and an aging population and promised to work toward the establishment of funding equity
    for the region</p>
    <p>CVH President, Wayne Fyffe says the document promotes the hospital&#146;s culture of
    caring and embraces a &quot;values based leadership&quot; philosophy. He says, &quot;we,
    as a team of health care professionals and support staff, are committed to excellence in
    patient care. Although we continue to face the challenge of securing adequate funding and
    physical capacity, we provide high quality health care for our patients and their
    families. We respect our physicians, staff and volunteers for the unique contribution and
    the compassionate care each of them provides and we value their support. This document is
    a testament to our collective values. Together we make a difference in the lives of our

    <p>April 16, 1999 </p>
    <p>D. Wayne Fyffe, President and CEO of The Credit Valley Hospital says he is delighted
    with the most recent announcement of new funding from the Ministry of Health. The hospital
    is to receive $3.1 million in interim funding for nursing. </p>
    <p>&quot;Investment in our nursing staff is essential as we struggle to cope with rapid
    population growth despite our limited physical capacity,&quot; Fyffe says. Mississauga is
    now the sixth largest city in Canada (slightly more populated than Vancouver). The
    population immediately surrounding the Credit Valley Hospital has grown by 48% in the last
    five years and will grow by another 32% in the next five years! </p>
    <p>Fyffe says the needs of the hospital&#146;s patients are at a critical point. &quot;CVH
    has only 200 acute care beds and no room to expand to accommodate more beds or patients.
    Sophisticated regional programs such as kidney dialysis and genetics, and planned regional
    programs for cancer and high risk maternal and child care serve a population in excess of
    one million people.&quot; A planned expansion to accommodate the regional cancer centre
    and support other ambulatory programs will eventually help to alleviate some space issues.
    The hospital is anxiously awaiting Ministry of Health funding approval for that project.</p>
    <p>In the meantime the hospital is doing its best to cope with the day to day care of the
    sick and injured. &quot;We have highly trained professionals who are committed to doing
    their best for our patients,&quot; Fyffe says. &quot;Our patients and our caregivers are
    often frustrated because of overcrowded conditions which results in less than optimal
    service in high traffic areas such as emergency, oncology and dialysis. </p>
    <p>&quot;When we calculated the resources required just to keep up with growth and ongoing
    operational expenses, <i>the total new funding required is in excess of $17 million.</i>
    The current interim nursing adjustment and other recent funding announcements add up to
    over $4.5 million which is a great shot in the arm,&quot; Fyffe says. &quot;We appreciate
    this help and we look forward to further adjustments to respond to our unique growth
    issues at The Credit Valley Hospital.&quot; </p>

    <p>The Coroner, Dr. Peter Kujtan has given The Credit Valley Hospital permission to
    clarify some misleading information released at a news conference yesterday by the NDP
    health critic relative to circumstances surrounding the tragic death of Ludy Masaba.
    Hospitals are required by law to protect patient confidentiality. However, The Credit
    Valley Hospital and the Coroner believe it is in the public&#146;s best interests to know
    that the standard of care was met by the hospital in this situation. </p>
    <p>A preliminary investigation requested of The Credit Valley Hospital by the Coroner, was
    undertaken immediately following Mrs. Masaba&#146;s death, March 4<sup>th</sup>. This is
    standard procedure following the death of any patient where the cause of death is not
    immediately known. A report of the preliminary investigation has been sent to Dr. Kujtan. </p>
    <p>Mrs. Masaba had been seen in the early afternoon of March 3<sup>rd</sup> in the
    emergency department of The Credit Valley Hospital. Mrs. Masaba was examined by an
    emergency room physician and appropriately discharged for followup care by her family
    physician. However later that evening, her condition deteriorated and she returned to the
    emergency department where she was immediately re-assessed, treated, admitted to an
    intensive care unit bed and then underwent emergency surgery.</p>
    <p>The medical condition suffered by Mrs. Masaba is rare. Statements about the cause of
    death, prior to completion of the autopsy, are pure speculation and inappropriate.</p>
    <p>However, it has been determined that there is an extremely low likelihood that Mrs.
    Masaba died from a Rasmussen aneurysm as was alluded to in the NDP news release.</p>
    <p>We appreciate how difficult it is for the family and caregivers to deal with an
    unexpected and unexplained death and our condolences are extended to the Masaba family
    during this difficult time. The investigation is ongoing and the hospital will continue to
    cooperate with the Coroner and the family to provide any answers which may be forthcoming
    to this mysterious death. We will respect the dignity of the family and the deceased by
    refraining from further public comment during the investigation.</p>
