<FONT SIZE=+1>Kashmiris are NOT Terrorists</FONT></H1></CENTER>

<CENTER>Cornered by the extensive reports of abuses of Human</CENTER>

<CENTER>Rights by the Indian security personnel, Indian</CENTER>

<CENTER>government changed tactics and countered the</CENTER>

<CENTER>international pressure by posing itself as an underdog</CENTER>

<CENTER>of the crisis. According to their new propaganda,</CENTER>

<CENTER>Kashmiris were a part of a mythical grandiose Islamic</CENTER>

<CENTER>terrorist movement directed at the rest of the world,</CENTER>

<CENTER>andIndia was one of its targets.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Many people would avoid the debate over terrorism by</CENTER>

<CENTER>simply stating that one man's terrorist is another</CENTER>

<CENTER>man's freedom fighter. However Kashmiris and their</CENTER>

<CENTER>supporters believe that the terrorizing of innocent</CENTER>

<CENTER>civilians to achieve a certain motive, whether justified</CENTER>

<CENTER>ornot, is unacceptable. This is evident from the behavior</CENTER>

<CENTER>of the Kashmiri freedom fighters and their supporters.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Analyzing the situation in Kashmir, it is soon realized</CENTER>

<CENTER>that there has not been a SINGLE act of terrorism by</CENTER>

<CENTER>the liberation movement directed against innocent</CENTER>

<CENTER>civilians, even as alleged by the Indian Government, in</CENTER>

<CENTER>the 50-year history of Kashmir's occupation. The</CENTER>

<CENTER>movement has strictly been localized with people</CENTER>

<CENTER>resisting the occupation forces in their own land.</CENTER>

<CENTER>There have been no attacks in the rest of Indian states</CENTER>

<CENTER>by the liberation movement, in order to force India off</CENTER>

<CENTER>Kashmir. It must be appreciated here that the</CENTER>

<CENTER>Kashmiri freedom fighters have had the chance but</CENTER>

<CENTER>have restrained themselves from indulging in terrorist</CENTER>

<CENTER>ventures in the rest of India in order to force them off</CENTER>

<CENTER>their land. In fact, the only acts of terrorism have been</CENTER>

<CENTER>those of the Indian Army, against innocent civilians,</CENTER>

<CENTER>which are well documented in the reports of Amnesty</CENTER>

<CENTER>International, Asia Watch and other international</CENTER>

<CENTER>HROs. What we see is the purest form of</CENTER>

<CENTER>state-terrorism, whereby a military power is seeking to</CENTER>

<CENTER>consolidate its hold on a foreign land through massive</CENTER>

<CENTER>suppression of the local population. Such acts of</CENTER>

<CENTER>brutality, as is obvious from the reports of&nbsp; Human Rights</CENTER>

<CENTER>Commissions around the world, find no parallel in</CENTER>

<CENTER>modern history. The immense restraint shown by the</CENTER>

<CENTER>Kashmiris in their methods of fighting for freedom led the</CENTER>

<CENTER>Indian Government to desperation. Its main intelligence&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>outfit RAW, executed a fake hijacking of an Indian Airliner</CENTER>

<CENTER>to Lahore in 1971, purportedly on behalf of the Kashmiris.</CENTER>

<CENTER>The aim was to give a terrorist dimension to a highly</CENTER>

<CENTER>defensive nature of Kashmiri national movement that at</CENTER>

<CENTER>that time was not even violent. It was quite</CENTER>

<CENTER>fortunate that soon the secret of RAW's involvement</CENTER>

<CENTER>was out. Incidentally, it was RAW which throughout</CENTER>

<CENTER>the Afghan War, masterminded the planning</CENTER>

<CENTER>and execution of the terrorist activities on</CENTER>

<CENTER>Pakistani soil. The purpose was to deter Pakistan from</CENTER>

<CENTER>its principled support of Afghan liberation movement</CENTER>

<CENTER>against India's ally, the ex-Soviet Union. The help</CENTER>

<CENTER>and finances given to RAW by the KGB, enabled India to</CENTER>

<CENTER>arrange hundreds of destructive bomb blasts in</CENTER>

<CENTER>Pakistani civilian centers throughout the Afghan War.</CENTER>

<CENTER>With the defeat of the Soviet Union such terrorist</CENTER>

<CENTER>activities by RAW did not finish in Pakistan. Such</CENTER>

<CENTER>activities continue to this day in order to, again, keep</CENTER>

<CENTER>Pakistan off balance. These terrorist activities of RAW</CENTER>

<CENTER>have been well reported in the international press,</CENTER>

<CENTER>especially during the Afghan War.</CENTER>
