  <H3>A. Background</H3>
<OL>
 <LI><A NAME="what">
      <STRONG>What is Apache?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Apache was originally based on code and ideas found in the most
  popular HTTP server of the time.. NCSA httpd 1.3 (early 1995). It has
  since evolved into a far superior system which can rival (and probably
  surpass) almost any other UNIX based HTTP server in terms of functionality,
  efficiency and speed.
  </P>
  <P>
  Since it began, it has been completely rewritten, and includes many new
  features. Apache is, as of January 1997, the most popular WWW server on
  the Internet, according to the
  <A HREF="http://www.netcraft.com/Survey/">Netcraft Survey</A>.
  </P>
  <HR>
 </LI>

 <LI><A NAME="why">
      <STRONG>Why was Apache created?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  To address the concerns of a group of WWW providers and part-time httpd
  programmers that httpd didn't behave as they wanted it to behave.
  Apache is an entirely volunteer effort, completely funded by its
  members, not by commercial sales.
  </P>
  <HR>
 </LI>

 <LI><A NAME="relate">
      <STRONG>How does The Apache Group's work relate to other
      server efforts, such as NCSA's?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  We, of course, owe a great debt to NCSA and their programmers for
  making the server Apache was based on. We now, however, have our own
  server, and our project is mostly our own. The Apache Project is an
  entirely independent venture.
  </P>
  <HR>
 </LI>

 <LI><A NAME="name">
      <STRONG>Why the name &quot;Apache&quot;?</STRONG>
      </A>
  <P>
  A cute name which stuck. Apache is &quot;<STRONG>A
  PA</STRONG>t<STRONG>CH</STRONG>y server&quot;.  It was
  based on some existing code and a series of &quot;patch files&quot;.
  </P>
  <HR>
 </LI>

 <LI><A NAME="compare">
      <STRONG>OK, so how does Apache compare to other servers?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  For an independent assessment, see
  <A HREF="http://webcompare.internet.com/chart.html">Web Compare</A>'s
  comparison chart.
  </P>
  <P>
  Apache has been shown to be substantially faster than many other
  free servers. Although certain commercial servers have claimed to
  surpass Apache's speed (it has not been demonstrated that any of these
  &quot;benchmarks&quot; are a good way of measuring WWW server speed at any
  rate), we feel that it is better to have a mostly-fast free server
  than an extremely-fast server that costs thousands of dollars. Apache
  is run on sites that get millions of hits per day, and they have
  experienced no performance difficulties.
  </P>
  <HR>
 </LI>

 <LI><A NAME="tested">
      <STRONG>How thoroughly tested is Apache?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Apache is run on over 3 million Internet servers (as of June 1999). It has
  been tested thoroughly by both developers and users. The Apache Group
  maintains rigorous standards before releasing new versions of their
  server, and our server runs without a hitch on over one half of all
  WWW servers available on the Internet.  When bugs do show up, we
  release patches and new versions as soon as they are available.
  </P>

    Apache tries to be helpful when it encounters a problem.  In many

  Yes, Apache is Year 2000 compliant.
  </P>
  <P>
  Apache internally never stores years as two digits.
  On the HTTP protocol level RFC1123-style addresses are generated
  which is the only format a HTTP/1.1-compliant server should
  generate. To be compatible with older applications Apache
  recognizes ANSI C's <CODE>asctime()</CODE> and
  RFC850-/RFC1036-style date formats, too.
  The <CODE>asctime()</CODE> format uses four-digit years,
  but the RFC850 and RFC1036 date formats only define a two-digit year.
  If Apache sees such a date with a value less than 70 it assumes that
  the century is <SAMP>20</SAMP> rather than <SAMP>19</SAMP>.
  </P>
  <P>
  Although Apache is Year 2000 compliant, you may still get problems
  if the underlying OS has problems with dates past year 2000
  (<EM>e.g.</EM>, OS calls which accept or return year numbers).
  Most (UNIX) systems store dates internally as signed 32-bit integers
  which contain the number of seconds since 1<SUP>st</SUP> January 1970, so
  the magic boundary to worry about is the year 2038 and not 2000.
  But modern operating systems shouldn't cause any trouble
  at all.

   The simple answer is: "It hasn't."  This misconception is usually
   caused by the site in question having migrated to the Apache Web
   server software, but not having migrated the site's content yet.  When
   Apache is installed, the default page that gets installed tells the
   Webmaster the installation was successful.  The expectation is that
   this default page will be replaced with the site's real content.
   If it doesn't, complain to the Webmaster, not to the Apache project --

   Regular expressions are a way of describing a pattern - for example, "all 
   the words that begin with the letter A" or "every 10-digit phone number" 
   or even "Every sentence with two commas in it, and no capital letter Q".  
   Regular expressions (aka "regexp"s) are useful in Apache because they 
   let you apply certain attributes against collections of files or resources 
   in very flexible ways - for example, all .gif and .jpg files under
   any "images" directory could be written as /.*\/images\/.*[jpg|gif]/.
   </P>

   The best overview around is probably the one which comes with Perl.
   We implement a simple subset of Perl's regexp support, but it's
   still a good way to learn what they mean.  You can start by going

    GCC parses your system header files and produces a modified subset which
    it uses for compiling.  This behaviour ties GCC tightly to the version
    of your operating system.  So, for example, if you were running IRIX 5.3
    when you built GCC and then upgrade to IRIX 6.2 later, you will have to
    rebuild GCC.  Similarly for Solaris 2.4, 2.5, or 2.5.1 when you upgrade

    of the operating system it was built against.

  Because of its parallel-operation model, the Apache Web server needs to
  provide some form of synchronization when accessing certain resources.
  One of these synchronization methods involves taking out locks on a file,
  which means that the filesystem whereon the lockfile resides must support
  locking.  In many cases this means it <EM>can't</EM> be kept on an
  NFS-mounted filesystem.
  </P>
  <P>
  To cause the Web server to work around the NFS locking limitations, include
  a line such as the following in your server configuration files:

      <STRONG>Why can't I run more than &lt;<EM>n</EM>&gt;
      virtual hosts?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  You are probably running into resource limitations in your
  operating system.  The most common limitation is the
  <EM>per</EM>-process limit on <STRONG>file descriptors</STRONG>,
  which is almost always the cause of problems seen when adding
  virtual hosts.  Apache often does not give an intuitive error
  message because it is normally some library routine (such as
  <CODE>gethostbyname()</CODE>) which needs file descriptors and
  doesn't complain intelligibly when it can't get them.
  </P>
  <P>
  Each log file requires a file descriptor, which means that if you are
  using separate access and error logs for each virtual host, each
  virtual host needs two file descriptors.  Each
  <A HREF="../mod/core.html#listen"><SAMP>Listen</SAMP></A>
  directive also needs a file descriptor.
  </P>
  <P>
  Typical values for &lt;<EM>n</EM>&gt; that we've seen are in
  the neighborhood of 128 or 250.  When the server bumps into the file
  descriptor limit, it may dump core with a SIGSEGV, it might just
  hang, or it may limp along and you'll see (possibly meaningful) errors
  in the error log.  One common problem that occurs when you run into
  a file descriptor limit is that CGI scripts stop being executed
  properly.
  </P>

  </P>
  <OL>
   <LI>Reduce the number of
    <A HREF="../mod/core.html#listen"><SAMP>Listen</SAMP></A>

    on the same port then you normally don't
    need any Listen directives at all.  By default Apache listens to
    all addresses on port 80.
   </LI>
   <LI>Reduce the number of log files.  You can use
    <A HREF="../mod/mod_log_config.html"><SAMP>mod_log_config</SAMP></A>
    to log all requests to a single log file while including the name
    of the virtual host in the log file.  You can then write a
    script to split the logfile into separate files later if
    necessary.  Such a script is provided with the Apache 1.3 distribution
    in the <SAMP>src/support/split-logfile</SAMP> file.

      <STRONG>Why do my Java app[let]s give me plain text when I request
      an URL from an Apache server?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  As of version 1.2, Apache is an HTTP/1.1 (HyperText Transfer Protocol
  version 1.1) server.  This fact is reflected in the protocol version
  that's included in the response headers sent to a client when
  processing a request.  Unfortunately, low-level Web access classes
  included in the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.0.2 expect to see
  the version string &quot;HTTP/1.0&quot; and do not correctly interpret
  the &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot; value Apache is sending (this part of the
  response is a declaration of what the server can do rather than a
  declaration of the dialect of the response).  The result
  is that the JDK methods do not correctly parse the headers, and
  include them with the document content by mistake.
  </P>
  <P>
  This is definitely a bug in the JDK 1.0.2 foundation classes from Sun,
  and it has been fixed in version 1.1.  However, the classes in
  question are part of the virtual machine environment, which means
  they're part of the Web browser (if Java-enabled) or the Java
  environment on the client system - so even if you develop
  <EM>your</EM> classes with a recent JDK, the eventual users might
  encounter the problem.
  The classes involved are replaceable by vendors implementing the
  Java virtual machine environment, and so even those that are based
  upon the 1.0.2 version may not have this problem.
  </P>
  <P>
  In the meantime, a workaround is to tell
  Apache to &quot;fake&quot; an HTTP/1.0 response to requests that come
  from the JDK methods; this can be done by including a line such as the
  following in your server configuration files:
  </P>
  <P>
  <DL>

 <LI><A NAME="premature-script-headers">
      <STRONG>What does it mean when my CGIs fail with
      &quot;<SAMP>Premature end of script headers</SAMP>&quot;?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  It means just what it says: the server was expecting a complete set of
  HTTP headers (one or more followed by a blank line), and didn't get
  them.
  </P>
  <P>
  The most common cause of this problem is the script dying before
  sending the complete set of headers, or possibly any at all, to the
  server.  To see if this is the case, try running the script standalone
  from an interactive session, rather than as a script under the server.
  If you get error messages, this is almost certainly the cause of the
  &quot;premature end of script headers&quot; message.  Even if the CGI 
  runs fine from the command line, remember that the environment and
  permissions may be different when running under the web server.  The
  CGI can only access resources allowed for the <A 
  HREF="../mod/core.html#user"><CODE>User</CODE></A> and 
  <A HREF="../mod/core.html#group"><CODE>Group</CODE></A> specified in 
  your Apache configuration.  In addition, the environment will not be 
  the same as the one provided on the command line, but it can be 
  adjusted using the directives provided by <A 
  HREF="../mod/mod_env.html">mod_env</A>.
  </P>
  <P>
  The second most common cause of this (aside from people not
  outputting the required headers at all) is a result of an interaction
  with Perl's output buffering.  To make Perl flush its buffers
  after each output statement, insert the following statements around
  the <CODE>print</CODE> or <CODE>write</CODE> statements that send your
  HTTP headers:
  </P>
  <P>
  <DL>
   <DD><CODE>{<BR>
    &nbsp;local ($oldbar) = $|;<BR>
    &nbsp;$cfh = select (STDOUT);<BR>
    &nbsp;$| = 1;<BR>
    &nbsp;#<BR>
    &nbsp;# print your HTTP headers here<BR>
    &nbsp;#<BR>
    &nbsp;$| = $oldbar;<BR>
    &nbsp;select ($cfh);<BR>
    }</CODE>
   </DD>
  </DL>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  This is generally only necessary when you are calling external
  programs from your script that send output to stdout, or if there will
  be a long delay between the time the headers are sent and the actual
  content starts being emitted.  To maximize performance, you should
  turn buffer-flushing back <EM>off</EM> (with <CODE>$| = 0</CODE> or the
  equivalent) after the statements that send the headers, as displayed
  above.
  </P>
  <P>
  If your script isn't written in Perl, do the equivalent thing for
  whatever language you <EM>are</EM> using (<EM>e.g.</EM>, for C, call
  <CODE>fflush()</CODE> after writing the headers).
  </P>
  <P>
  Another cause for the &quot;premature end of script headers&quot;
  message are the RLimitCPU and RLimitMEM directives. You may
  get the message if the CGI script was killed due to a
  resource limit.
  </P>
  <P>
  In addition, a configuration problem in <A
  HREF="../suexec.html">suEXEC</A>, mod_perl, or another third party
  module can often interfere with the execution of your CGI and cause
  the &quot;premature end of script headers&quot; message.

      <STRONG>Why do I keep getting &quot;Method Not Allowed&quot; for

  This is almost always due to Apache not being configured to treat the

  to a normal HTML file; the operation has no meaning.  See the FAQ

     </A>
  <P>
  As of Apache 1.3, CGI scripts are essentially not buffered.  Every time
  your script does a "flush" to output data, that data gets relayed on to
  the client.  Some scripting languages, for example Perl, have their own
  buffering for output - this can be disabled by setting the <CODE>$|</CODE>
  special variable to 1.  Of course this does increase the overall number
  of packets being transmitted, which can result in a sense of slowness for 
  the end user.
  </P>
  <P>Prior to 1.3, you needed to use "nph-" scripts to accomplish
  non-buffering.  Today, the only difference between nph scripts and
  normal scripts is that nph scripts require the full HTTP headers to

  SSI (an acronym for Server-Side Include) directives allow static HTML
  documents to be enhanced at run-time (<EM>e.g.</EM>, when delivered to
  a client by Apache).  The format of SSI directives is covered
  in the <A HREF="../mod/mod_include.html">mod_include manual</A>;
  suffice it to say that Apache supports not only SSI but
  xSSI (eXtended SSI) directives.
  </P>
  <P>
  Processing a document at run-time is called <EM>parsing</EM> it; hence
  the term &quot;parsed HTML&quot; sometimes used for documents that
  contain SSI instructions.  Parsing tends to be <EM>extremely</EM>
  resource-consumptive, and is not enabled by default.  It can also
  interfere with the cachability of your documents, which can put a

  Since the server is performing run-time processing of your SSI
  directives, which may change the content shipped to the client, it
  can't know at the time it starts parsing what the final size of the
  result will be, or whether the parsed result will always be the same.
  This means that it can't generate <SAMP>Content-Length</SAMP> or
  <SAMP>Last-Modified</SAMP> headers.  Caches commonly work by comparing
  the <SAMP>Last-Modified</SAMP> of what's in the cache with that being
  delivered by the server.  Since the server isn't sending that header
  for a parsed document, whatever's doing the caching can't tell whether
  the document has changed or not - and so fetches it again to be on the
  safe side.
  </P>

  You can work around this in some cases by causing an

    The usual reason for this is that <SAMP>Host.FooBar.Com</SAMP> is

 <LI><A NAME="rewrite-complexity">
      <STRONG>Why is mod_rewrite so difficult to learn and seems so
      complicated?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Hmmm... there are a lot of reasons. First, mod_rewrite itself is a powerful
  module which can help you in really <STRONG>all</STRONG> aspects of URL
  rewriting, so it can be no trivial module per definition. To accomplish
  its hard job it uses software leverage and makes use of a powerful regular
  expression
  library by Henry Spencer which is an integral part of Apache since its
  version 1.2.  And regular expressions itself can be difficult to newbies,
  while providing the most flexible power to the advanced hacker. 
  </P>
  <P>
  On the other hand mod_rewrite has to work inside the Apache API environment
  and needs to do some tricks to fit there. For instance the Apache API as of
  1.x really was not designed for URL rewriting at the <TT>.htaccess</TT>
  level of processing. Or the problem of multiple rewrites in sequence, which
  is also not handled by the API per design. To provide this features
  mod_rewrite has to do some special (but API compliant!) handling which leads
  to difficult processing inside the Apache kernel. While the user usually
  doesn't see anything of this processing, it can be difficult to find
  problems when some of your RewriteRules seem not to work.

  Use &quot;<SAMP>RewriteLog somefile</SAMP>&quot; and

  <P>
  If the rule starts with <SAMP>/somedir/...</SAMP> make sure that
  really no <SAMP>/somedir</SAMP> exists on the filesystem if you
  don't want to lead the URL to match this directory, <EM>i.e.</EM>,
  there must be no root directory named <SAMP>somedir</SAMP> on the

  get prefixed with DocumentRoot. This behaviour looks ugly, but is

 <LI><A NAME="rewrite-nocase">
      <STRONG>How can I make all my URLs case-insensitive with mod_rewrite?

     </A>
  <P>
  You can't! The reason is: First, case translations for arbitrary
  length URLs cannot be done <EM>via</EM> regex patterns and
  corresponding substitutions.  One need a per-character pattern like
  sed/Perl <SAMP>tr|..|..|</SAMP> feature.  Second, just making URLs
  always upper or lower case will not resolve the complete problem of
  case-INSENSITIVE URLs, because actually the URLs had to be rewritten
  to the correct case-variant residing on the filesystem because in
  later processing Apache needs to access the file.  And Unix
  filesystem is always case-SENSITIVE.

  There is only one ugly solution: You have to surround the complete
  flag argument by quotation marks (<SAMP>"[E=...]"</SAMP>). Notice:
  The argument to quote here is not the argument to the E-flag, it is
  the argument of the Apache config file parser, <EM>i.e.</EM>, the
  third argument of the RewriteRule here.  So you have to write
  <SAMP>"[E=any text with whitespaces]"</SAMP>.

  &quot;Multiviews&quot; is the general name given to the Apache

  response to a request.  This is documented quite thoroughly in the
  <A HREF="../content-negotiation.html" REL="Help">content negotiation</A>

  Because you need to install and configure a script to handle

  There are several available, but they may have security problems.
  Using FTP uploads may be easier and more secure, at least for now.

 <LI><A NAME="SSL-i">
      <STRONG>Why doesn't Apache include SSL?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  SSL (Secure Socket Layer) data transport requires encryption, and many
  governments have restrictions upon the import, export, and use of
  encryption technology.  If Apache included SSL in the base package,
  its distribution would involve all sorts of legal and bureaucratic
  issues, and it would no longer be freely available.  Also, some of
  the technology required to talk to current clients using SSL is
  patented by <A HREF="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA Data Security</A>,
  who restricts its use without a license.
  </P>
  <P>
  Some SSL implementations of Apache are available, however; see the
  &quot;<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/related_projects.html"
        >related projects</A>&quot;

      <STRONG>How can I attach a footer to my documents

     </A>
  <P>
  You can make arbitrary changes to static documents by configuring an
  <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_actions.html#action">
  Action</A> which launches a CGI script.  The CGI is then
  responsible for setting a content-type and delivering the requested
  document (the location of which is passed in the
  <SAMP>PATH_TRANSLATED</SAMP> environment variable), along with
  whatever footer is needed.
  </P>
  <P>
  Busy sites may not want to run a CGI script on every request, and
  should consider using an Apache module to add the footer.  There are
  several third party modules available through the <A
  HREF="http://modules.apache.org/">Apache Module Registry</A> which
  will add footers to documents.  These include mod_trailer, PHP
  (<SAMP>php3_auto_append_file</SAMP>), and mod_perl
