<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Apache Virtual Host documentation</H1>

<P>The term <CITE>Virtual Host</CITE> refers to the practice of maintaining
more than one server on one machine, as differentiated by their apparent
hostname. For example, it is often desirable for companies sharing a
web server to have their own domains, with web servers accessible as
<SAMP>www.company1.com</SAMP> and <SAMP>www.company2.com</SAMP>,
without requiring the user to know any extra path information.</P>

<P>Apache was one of the first servers to support IP-based
virtual hosts right out of the box. Versions 1.1 and later of
Apache support both, IP-based and name-based virtual hosts (vhosts).
The latter variant of virtual hosts is sometimes also called host-based or
non-IP virtual hosts.</P>

<P>Below is a list of documentation pages which explain all details
of virtual host support in Apache version 1.3 and later.</P>

<P>Folks trying to debug their virtual host configuration may find the
Apache <CODE>-S</CODE> command line switch useful.  It will dump out a
description of how Apache parsed the configuration file.  Careful
examination of the IP addresses and server names may help uncover
configuration mistakes.
