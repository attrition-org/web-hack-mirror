<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+4">General Tour Information</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">Our tours are designed for people that want
to be introduced to a new culture.&nbsp; For SCUBA divers or potential
SCUBA divers it is some of the finest diving you can get at great
prices.&nbsp; Trekking and Eco-Touring in some of the finest and
wildest country in the world, with different trips available for
all levels of travelers. Night life on our tours is a bonus although
some people go for the night life alone - Whether it is a family
looking for cultural tours and native food, or singles looking
for night clubs after diving and dinner our tours accomodate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">We run these tours because we love the countries,
the scenery and the people. &nbsp; If you are not of the same
mind, please travel with someone else.&nbsp; Better yet - stay
home.&nbsp; Westerners have a bad enough reputation in Asia without
additional help from biggots, pedophiles or jerks.&nbsp; If you
want a great time we can help you, otherwise we are not the ones.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">What we do involves some level of danger, whether
its SCUBA diving, kyacking down a primitive river or hiking up
a volcano - WWIM Assumes no responsibility for your safety beyond
doing our best to share our experience in these areas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="+2">WARNING</FONT><FONT SIZE="+2">
- If you are planning on traveling to the Philippines, Thailand
or other Southeast Asian Country on a package, avoid any company
that intimates or suggests they are a &quot;sex tour&quot; organization
or &quot;mail order bride&quot; service or &quot;match making&quot;
service. Many of these services are considered illegal in many
countries. Some of the operators are not welcome in many of the
countries we travel to. You may find your tour guide being detained
at the Airport, worse still you may be denied entry into the country</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">DO NOT AS US ABOUT CHILDREN.&nbsp; Many of
our destinations have been abused by Westerners looking for sex
with children.&nbsp; We will report any abuse of children to the
proper authorities.&nbsp; We respect the right of children in
all counties to have a happy childhood - what they do after they
become adults is their business.</FONT>
