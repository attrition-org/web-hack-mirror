these proud yet warm people were holding a meeting here in the two room
schoolhouse.&nbsp; The adults were in one room, while the children were
learning in the other room.&nbsp; The women grouped in the chairs in the
front and the men stood in the back. Two things to accomplish this day
1) where would they put the first aid station that they were going to build
and 2) the legible signing of their name on paper so they could receive
a small bag of&nbsp; dry goods.&nbsp; Even though I couldn't speak their
language, and vice-a-versa, we ended up speaking with our eyes and our
hearts.&nbsp;</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">The homemade tequilla was pretty
danm good too!</FONT></TD>
