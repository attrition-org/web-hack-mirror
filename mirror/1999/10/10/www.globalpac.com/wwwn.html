<P>Orange-based Global Pacific Internet has received $1 million in funding
to expand its wireless Internet service outside the county and plans to
go public within the next six months to raise in excess of $20 million to
expand operations nationwide, according to CEO Jack Tortorice.</P>

<P>Tortorice said the 30-person firm has received money from Utah investors
to expand wireless service to Los Angeles and San Diego counties and the
Inland Empire.&nbsp; Those same investors plan to assist the firm in an
IPO on Nasdaq later this year, he said.</P>

<P>The company provides wireless Internet access to more than 100= businesses
in Orange County and the more-common wired access to more than 3,000= businesses
and individuals. The firm intends to expand to 10,000 wireless customers
by the end of the year, according to company founder Dennis Shen.</P>

<P>To access the net, a Global wireless client sticks a microwave reception
antenna on the roof of the company's building, or on a window, and that
antenna connects with one of Global's nine broadcast antennas spread throughout
the county.&nbsp; The customer must be within five miles of a Global antenna
and preferably able to see if from the building.</P>

<P>Shen says his firm's wireless service is faster than most other means
of connecting to the Internet, and is cheaper than some of the fastest lines.</P>

<P>The system can also be set up quickly, even in the county's high rises.&nbsp;
Property Manager Frank Romagnano said that when Pacific Bell terminated
phone connections of internet access provider Larkom in December, tenants
in high rises he manages were suddenly cut off from the net.</P>

<P>He said PacBell told him it would take 30 to 45 days to re-establish
the high-speed system that connected tenants to the net.&nbsp; Yet, Global
connected many of his tenants to the net in nine days.</P>

<P>The ability to wirelessly connect a high rise to the Internet would seem
to undercut some South County developers who tout the voice and data lines
their new campus-style buildings have.&nbsp; Some developers have also pointed
out that their buildings have conduits through which more wires could be
run later.</P>

<P>But what if businesses don't need wires to connect to the Internet?&nbsp;
Shen said Global can connect a tenant to the antenna on the roof of his
or her building without running a wire. But such a truly wireless system
is more costly.&nbsp; To remain economically competitive, the building still
needs to have internal wires with appropriate capacity.</TD></TR>

<P><FONT COLOR="#02007F">As printed in The Orange County Business Journal
week of Oct 19th, 1998</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00007F">Orange, Ca. <BR>
Orange County Business are Un-Plugging the Internet on a daily basis.&nbsp;
But, they're not going Offline; they're going </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Wireless
with Global Pacific Wireless Internet.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00007F">&nbsp;</FONT></B><FONT
 COLOR="#00007F"> And, it's Fast, Secure and Affordable.&nbsp; Why and how
are they Un-plugging?</FONT></P>

<P>The <B><FONT COLOR="#CC0000">&quot;Why&quot;</FONT></B> is to save money
every month, by cutting the Phone Company (Telco) middleman out of the loop.
Since most business need a high-speed connection to the Internet, a standard
modem connection is too slow and expensive when they have to pay those per-minute
business phone bills on top of ISP fees for each user.&nbsp; Traditionally,
the only other alternatives were to get a Frame Relay (shared high-speed
connection) or Dedicated Private Line (non-shared high-speed connection).&nbsp;
Both of these options can cost several thousand dollars every month, since
you have to pay the Internet Service Provider (ISP) several hundred dollars
for the high speed connection to the internet, and then they also have to
pay the Phone Company (Telco) a &quot;local loop&quot; charge to connect
the business to the ISP, which can sometimes cost more than the ISP access
fee .&nbsp; With Global Pacific's Wireless Business Access, those Telco
Loop Charges are history.</P>

<P>The<B><FONT COLOR="#CC0000"> &quot;How&quot;</FONT></B> is done with
the help of Global's Internet radios to receive a 24-hour high-speed connection
from our transmitter radios strategically placed throughout Orange County.&nbsp;
With Global's Internet Radio Network, any business can eliminate the monthly
Telco charges and still have a highly secured connection thanks to Spread
Spectrum Technology (SST) and Frequency Sequence Hopping (FSH).&nbsp; This
Frequency Hopping technique was developed by the military over 20 years
ago, to prevent unauthorized reception of their radio waves.&nbsp; By switching
the frequency every 400 milli-seconds (4 times per second), even if an unauthorized
user accidentally found your frequency, it would change so fast that they
could not catch it again without knowing your exact frequency-hopping pattern.
Your hopping pattern is confidential, so your connection is secure.</P>

<P>What speed connection can Global's Wireless Internet Access give you?&nbsp;
Speeds range from 256 KbPS (Kilobits Per Second) up to 3 MbPS (Megabits
Per Second).&nbsp; Ten-Megabit radios are being tested now, and should be
available in the near future.</P>

<P>You've read how Global Pacific's Wireless Internet for business compares
to Frame Relay and Dedicated Private Lines, but how do we compare to other
connectivity options, like DSL and Cable Modems?</P>

<P>Well, with DSL (Digital Subscriber Lines) first you have to be within
3 wire miles of an authorized Telco Central Office. Since the Telco Central
Offices are not on every corner, this eliminates most business prospects
for DSL.&nbsp; You also have to be in a building that doesn't have too many
phone lines since there is a high incidence of interference or leakage.&nbsp;
If your phone line has ever been cut, there is also a good chance that DSL
will not work in your situation.&nbsp; It's been estimated that only a small
percentage of businesses that are within range even qualifies for a clean
DSL connection.</P>

<P>What about Cable Modems?&nbsp; Cable modems are not available to most
businesses, since they are aimed at the consumer market and not the business
market that Global Pacific is focused on.&nbsp; Cable modems are also not
very practical for business networks because they don't allow sub-addressing,
which is required for Local Area Networks.&nbsp; There are also security
and speed concerns, since so many households will be sharing that Cable
modem connection to the Internet, you could slow down to regular dial up
modem speeds.</P>

<P>The only requirements for a Wireless connection to the Internet from
Global Pacific is that your building be &quot;visible&quot; to one of our
many strategically located transmitters in Orange County.&nbsp; We'll come
to your office building and perform a FREE Site Survey to verify &quot;visibility&quot;
and radio reception range.&nbsp; Once visibility has been verified, we'll
schedule the receiving antenna installation so you can get Un-Plugged and
Connected at the same time!&nbsp; There are also a variety of Wireless radios
to fit most any network configuration to suit your specific needs.</P>

<P>Global Pacific's Wireless connection, not only gives you a 24-hour Internet
connection, you can also use it to expand your Local Area Network (LAN)
without having to re-wire your offices.&nbsp; A Wireless PCMCIA card can
even convert any portable computer with a Type II slot into a Wireless LAN
workstation that can roam within the LAN.</P>
