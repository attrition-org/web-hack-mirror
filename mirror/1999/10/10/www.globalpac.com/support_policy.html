Consequently, we expectthat our users shall conduct themselves in a professional manner and demonstratedue courtesy and respect to others in the Internet community. While we arestrong proponents of free speech, we are also strong advocates of personalresponsibility.</P><P>The Internet is a new frontier where freedom abounds. There is no centralauthority. It transcends geographic boundaries and legal jurisdictions.The Internet community is largely left to police itself, for with freedomcomes responsibility.</P><P>It is with this spirit of freedom and responsibility that we have developedthese acceptable use policies. These are general guidelines which may changefrom time to time as required when faced with new situations. After all,the Internet is still evolving at a very rapid pace and we are all strivingto keep abreast of new applications, and alas, abuses of these technologies.We shall endeavor to advise our customers of changes in policy; yet, itis your responsibility to be aware of new changes and to abide by them.</P><P>The following activities fall outside of what we consider acceptable use.</P><UL>  <LI><FONT COLOR="#0600B5">Malicious Activities / Hacking</FONT>  <LI><FONT COLOR="#0600B5">Spamming / Bulk Unsolicited E-Mail</FONT>  <LI><FONT COLOR="#0600B5">Pornographic Web Sites without proper age verification measures.</FONT></UL><P>Our policies are not written in stone, and exceptions can be made. Ingeneral, however, these activities will result in the cancellation. We arenot trying to restrict our customers freedom, but to protect the privacyof the general population. In particular, several providers are threateningto filter mail from our domain to limit unsolicited e-mail. This hurts everyone,especially the innocent people who were not involved. We are dedicated tomaking sure that this will not happen.
