I hope to find the time to put together a quarterly newsletter,  but with all my projects going on, I may only have time for the occasional  &quot;as time permits&quot; update (like this one). Since, there is a lot  of information to share in this newsletter; I am breaking it into two parts.  This is Part 1, and I'll send you all Part 2 in a separate message. Part  2 will cover our new Website Marketing Services.</FONT></P>  <P><A HREF="#gpiu">Top of Page</A></BLOCKQUOTE></TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="188">&nbsp;</TD><TD><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><BR CLEAR="ALL"><A NAME="newsite"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#000ED7">GPI's  New Website: Check it out @ http://www.globalpac.com</FONT></B></P>  <P>Well folks, it's finally here! That's right, the new Global Pacific  Internet Website is officially available for your review. As I've mentioned  in previous messages, we'll continue to offer all the services we've had  in the past like Dialup Access, Web Design, Hosting, Frame Relay and Co-Location.  But we are primarily going to focus on promoting our unique High Speed  (T1) Wireless Bandwidth for businesses since that is something that none  of our ISP competitors can offer. It just makes sense to lead with our  unique services more than our &quot;me too&quot; ISP services.</P>  <P>There may be a couple links that don't work yet or content updates,  but most of them will be fixed as soon as possible. Let us know what you  think.</P>  <P><A HREF="#gpiu">Top of Page</A></BLOCKQUOTE></TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><BR CLEAR="ALL"><A NAME="wt1"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#0300E3">GPI's Wireless  T1 service: Double Your Bandwidth, and Lower Your Cost.</FONT></B></P>  <P>For those of you that aren't familiar with either the Wireless or T1  references, I'll explain both. I'll start with the T1 since that covers  two services we offer mostly to businesses. You're all familiar with modem  speeds of 28.8 and 56 KbPS (kilo bits per second), well a T1 connects to  the Internet at 1544 KBPS or 1.5 MbPS (mega bits per second). To put things  in better perspective a ... a T1 is 107 times faster than a 14.4 modem  and 27 times faster than a 56k modem. It's also a lot more expensive than  these common dialup speeds, which is why it is mostly used by businesses  that have many online users that share this faster high bandwidth.</P>  <P>Many ISP's (including GPI) offer wired T1's or Frame Relay access, but  GPI is the only So/Cal ISP to offer Wireless T1 access which actually delivers  Double the Bandwidth of a standard Wired T1. The Wireless doubling comes  from allowing full T1 speeds for concurrently sending and receiving your  internet feed, so your effective bandwidth is actually 3 MbPS instead of  1.5 MbPS. It's also Less Expensive than a Wired T1 because there are no  Telco Charges to receive the Internet feed. This can save you over $600  a month!</P>  <P><A HREF="#gpiu">Top of Page</A></BLOCKQUOTE></TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="93">&nbsp;</TD><TD><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><BR CLEAR="ALL"><A NAME="bonus"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#1C00F5">GPI's Wireless  T1 Bonus Offer: Earn $200 for every Wireless Sale you refer!</FONT></B></P>  <P>We plan to market our Wireless T1 service aggressively with direct mail  and telemarketing, but we really want your help too. In fact, we'd like  to pay you a $200 finder's fee if your referral buys our Wireless service.  We may increase this fee depending on additional services your referral  buys. I hope we have to pay out $1000's of dollars in referral fees!</P>  <P><A HREF="#gpiu">Top of Page</A></BLOCKQUOTE></TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="571">&nbsp;</TD><TD><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><BR CLEAR="ALL"><A NAME="spam"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#0003E8">GPI's Anti-Spamming  Policy: Spam Activities are </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#0003E8"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><B>unacceptable and will be penalized.</B></FONT></P>  <P>I know it seems ironic that I sent you this newsletter with our Anti-Spam  policy via a bulk email process without your specifically requesting it,  but since you are using our services we feel it is more of a vendor-client  update with implied acceptance. I hope you'll accept this sincere rationalization  with my apology if you feel your mailbox has been invaded. I assure you  that I only plan to send these updates out a few times a year, so we will  not be too intrusive. However, I am afraid I can't delete you from our  update list since it is going to our full client base to make sure everyone  is aware of changes and improvements with your service provider, Global  Pacific Internet.</P>  <P>In essence, our Anti-Spam policy is this. If you use any of our services:  (dialup modems, email servers, or newsgroup servers, etc.) to send a volume  of unsolicited email, and we receive a number of complaints about such  activities, we will cancel your account and may take legal actions as allowed  by California law. There has been a bill introduced to the California Assembly  AB1629, which could impose a fine of $250 per email message up to $5000  and one year in jail.</P>  <P>Why are we taking such drastic actions? Well, in mid-July, we were Spam  attacked as a result of an unethical person sending out junk email (Spam)  to hundreds of thousands of email addresses and they used one of our client's  email addresses as a return address for the Spam. They didn't use their  email address because they know their actions are wrong and there is always  severe backlash with Spam, and they didn't want to take responsibility  for their unethical actions.</P>  <P>This naturally caused a flood of complaints and the other ISP (AOL in  this case) automatically bounced all the Spam and legitimate email straight  to us since the Spammer stole and used one of our addresses. This action  caused our mail server to crash several times that week and took almost  80 work-hours to contain the problem and fix the server. This can also  get our mail servers banned from other ISP's so you and others won't be  able to send real and legitimate email. As you can see, this is very serious,  and we will take appropriate actions when necessary.</P>  <P>Now you know how we feel about Spam. So what can you do when you are  the unfortunate recipient of Spam? Well, the first and usually the best  thing to do, is just ignore and delete it. I know this isn't very emotionally  satisfying since Spam usually makes you want to send a complaint to the  sender, but ignoring Spam is the best response for the following reasons.  First, most Spammers never use their real email address for replies because  they know they're breaking the rules of online etiquette, so your reply  will usually be sent to an unsuspecting victim just like you. This is what  happened in mid-July, which caused a ton of technical headaches for a whole  week.</P>  <P>Also, many Spam messages will say if you want to be deleted from their  list, just send a msg to a specific email address asking to be removed.  Many times this is a trick to get you to send a msg so they can capture  and validate your email address as being current. Many email lists used  by Spammers are old and outdated, so they need to find a way to trick you  into validating your address. Rarely, is their promise to remove your from  an email list true.</P>  <P>We are considering software that will filter out all email that you  haven't pre-approved. I'll let you know when that is available and the  cost involved.</P>  <P><A HREF="#gpiu">Top of Page</A></BLOCKQUOTE></TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="1072">&nbsp;</TD><TD><P>&nbsp;</TD><TD><CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="600" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="84%" HEIGHT="20"><BLOCKQUOTE>  <A NAME="marketing"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#B80000" SIZE="+1">New Website Marketing  Services</FONT></B></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR><TR><TD><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><BR CLEAR="ALL"><B><FONT COLOR="#000AD1">GPI's Website Marketing service:  Meta Tag Analysis, Search Engine <BR CLEAR="ALL">Submittal, Position Tracking  &amp; Visitor Stats.</FONT></B></P>  <P>Having a Website is the just the beginning for your business to establish  an online presence.

However, I don't  recommend hit counters since that makes your traffic very public so your  competitors also know how successful or unsuccessful your Website is. Plus  hit counters only show raw visit numbers without any detail on where they  came from or who referred them to your Website.</P>  <P>The best way to monitor your Website traffic is with a Website Statistics  Report. We use one of the best Stat report programs on the market called  Statistics Server from Media House. It's a great product that gives you  a ton of information for your marketing department to analyze in depth.</P>  <P>You'll know exactly how many visits each of your web pages gets per  day, week or month. You'll also know how long they stayed on your Website,  and which pages they entered or exited from (find out where they may lose  interest). You'll know which Website (including Search Engine-Directories)  referred them to your Website, and which domains, country or state they  came from. You'll even know how much bandwidth your using and much more.  All this can be documented on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. These  reports are available to you 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world  with the proper login and password. This marketing rich information can  also be exported to your database or spreadsheets for your in-house analysis.</P>  <P>The monthly price for this invaluable service is FREE, if you have a  Gold or Platinum Business account and just $10 a month for our Silver Business  accounts. There is a one-time setup fee of $20 that will be waived with  an Annual Prepaid Hosting fee for any of our business plans. This is only  available for Private Business Domain accounts that use a URL like www.yourbiz.com,  and not www.globalpac.com/yourbiz.</P>  <P><A HREF="#gpiu">Top of Page</A></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="580" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="22%"><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="site-survey.html"><IMG SRC="img/ss-button.jpg"WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="125" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A></TD><TD WIDTH="78%"><P>If you have any questions or concerns please contact us, at your conveniencevia E-Mail: <B><A HREF="mailto:sale@globalpac.com">sales@globalpac.com </A></B></P><P><B>888-50-WIRELESS (888-509-4735) </B></P><P><B>tel: 714-937-5500 </B>or<B> fax: 714-937-6310 </B></P><P>[<A HREF="index.html">main</A>] [<A HREF="wireless_main.html">wireless</A>][<A HREF="about_us_main.html">about us</A>] [<A HREF="sales_services_main.html">salesand services</A>] [<A HREF="support_main.html">tech support</A>] [<A HREF="http://start.globalpac.com/search.cfm">best of the web</A>] [<A HREF="contact_us_main.html">contactus</A>]</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
