      <tr>
        <td valign="top" align="center" width="528"><font size="2" face="arial,geneva"><p align="left">As an Internet service provider (&quot;ISP&quot;), we offer our subscribers
        the means to acquire and disseminate a wealth of public, private, commercial and
        non-commercial information. We also want our subscribers to be fully informed of their
        rights and obligations -- and ours -- in connection with their use of the Internet. This
        Network Access Policy, which supplements and explains certain terms of each customer's
        respective services agreement (the &quot;Services Agreement&quot;), is intended as a plain
        English guide to those rights and obligations. <br>
        <br>
        The fundamental fact about the Internet is that no one --neither us, nor anyone else --
        owns or controls it. This fact accounts for much of the Internet's openness and value, but
        it also places a high premium on the judgment and responsibility of those who use the
        Internet, both in the information they acquire and in the information they disseminate to
        others. When subscribers obtain information through the Internet, they must keep in mind
        that we cannot monitor, verify, warrant or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the
        information that subscribers may acquire. For this reason, the subscriber must exercise
        his or her best judgment in relying on information obtained from the Internet, and also
        should be aware that some material posted to the Internet is sexually explicit or
        otherwise offensive. Because we cannot monitor and censor the Internet, and will not
        attempt to do so, we cannot accept any responsibility for injury to our subscribers that
        results from inaccurate, unsuitable or offensive Internet communications. <br>
        <br>
        When subscribers disseminate information through the Internet, they also must keep in mind
        that we do not review, edit, censor or take responsibility for any information our
        subscribers may create. This places on subscribers what will be, for most, an unfamiliar
        responsibility. When users place information on the Internet, they have the same liability
        as other authors for copyright infringement, defamation and other harmful speech. Also,
        because the information they create is carried over our facilities and may reach a large
        number of people, including both subscribers and nonsubscribers of ours, subscribers'
        postings to the Internet may affect other subscribers and may harm our goodwill, business
        reputation and operations. For these reasons, subscribers violate our policy and the
        Services Agreement when they, their affiliates or subsidiaries engage in the following
        activities: <br>
        <br>
        Spamming -- Unsolicited, commercial mass e-mailing (known as &quot;spamming&quot;) is a
        strongly disfavored practice among Internet users and service providers. It is
        particularly harmful not only because of its negative impact on consumer attitudes toward
        us, but also because it can overload our equipment and disrupt service to our subscribers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Copyright Violation -- Violation of copyrights held by individuals and corporations or
        other entities can result in civil and criminal liability for the infringer, and can
        involve the ISP in litigation and possible loss of reputation. <br>
        <br>
        Distribution and/or Transmission of Obscene or Indecent Speech or Materials -- Violation
        of indecency and obscenity laws can result in criminal penalties. <br>
        <br>
        Defamation -- Defamatory speech distributed over the Internet can result in civil
        liability for the defamer and litigation against the ISP whose facilities were used to
        distribute the defamatory material. <br>
        <br>
        Illegal/Unauthorized Access to Other Computers or Networks -- The illegal or unauthorized
        accessing (often known as &quot;hacking&quot;) of computers or networks carries potential
        civil and criminal penalties under both federal laws and the laws of most states. <br>
        <br>
        Distribution of Internet Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses and Other Destructive Activities --
        Distribution of Internet viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other destructive activities,
        such as hacking, can result in serious civil and or criminal liability under federal and
        state law. <br>
        <br>
        Export Control Violations -- The law limits the ability of persons to export encryption
        software, over the Internet or otherwise, to points outside the United States. <br>
        <br>
        Other Activities, whether lawful or unlawful, that we determine to be harmful to our
        subscribers, operations or reputation, including any activities that restrict or inhibit
        any other user from using and enjoying the service or the Internet. <br>
        <br>
        As we have pointed out, the responsibility for avoiding the harmful activities just
        described rests primarily with the subscriber. We will not, as an ordinary practice,
        monitor the communications of our subscribers to ensure that they comply with our policy
        or applicable law. When we become aware of harmful communications, however, we may take
        any of a variety of actions. We may remove information that violates our policies,
        implement screening software designed to block offending transmissions, or take any other
        action we deem appropriate, including termination of a subscriber's contract with us. <br>
        <br>
        We also are aware that many of our subscribers are, themselves, providers of Internet
        services, and that information reaching our facilities from those subscribers may have
        been originated by customers of those subscribers or other third parties. We do not
        require our subscribers who offer Internet services to monitor or censor transmissions
        created by customers of its subscribers. At the same time, subscribers who knowingly
        transmit materials that violate law or our policy are, themselves, in violation of our
        policy. Similarly, we anticipate that subscribers who offer Internet services will
        cooperate with us in any corrective action that we deem necessary, in order to correct and
        prevent the transmission of material that is harmful to us or our subscribers. Failure to
        cooperate with such corrective and preventive measures is a violation of our policy. <br>
        <br>
        We also are concerned with the privacy of on-line communications. In general, the Internet
        is neither more nor less secure than other common communications media, including mail,
        facsimile and voice telephone service, all of which can be intercepted and otherwise
        compromised. As a matter of prudence, however, we urge our subscribers to assume that all
        of their on-line communications are insecure. <br>
        <br>
        We can not take any responsibility for the security of communications transmitted over our
        facilities. We will comply fully, however, with all applicable laws concerning the privacy
        of our subscribers' on-line communications. In particular, we will not intentionally
        monitor or disclose any private electronic mail messages sent or received by our
        subscribers unless required to do so by law. We may, however, monitor our service
        electronically to determine that our facilities are operating satisfactorily. Also, we may
        be required to disclose information transmitted through our facilities in order to comply
        with court orders, statutes, regulations or governmental requests. Finally, we may
        disclose information transmitted over our facilities where necessary to protect us and our
        subscribers from harm, or where such disclosure is necessary to the proper operation of
        the system. <br>
        <br>
        We expect that our subscribers who provide Internet services to others will comply fully
        with all applicable laws concerning the privacy of on-line communications. A subscriber's
        failure to comply with those laws will violate our policy. Finally, we wish to emphasize
        that in signing the Services Agreement, subscribers indemnify us for any violation of the
        subscriber of the Services Agreement, or of law or Verio policy, that results in loss to
        us or the bringing of any claim against us. This means that if we are sued because of
        activities of the subscriber that violate any law, the Services Agreement or this policy
        (which is part of the Services Agreement), the subscriber will pay any damages awarded
        against us, plus costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. <br>
        <br>
        We hope this Policy Statement is helpful in clarifying the obligations of Internet users,
        including us and our subscribers, as responsible members of the Internet.</font></p>
