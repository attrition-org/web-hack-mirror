        </p>
        <p><font face="ARIAL" size="2">Your right to privacy is very important. We recognize that
        when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a
        responsible manner. We believe this information should only be used to help us provide you
        with better service. That's why we have put a policy in place to protect your personal
        information. Below is a summary of our policy. </p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff"><b>What personal information do we collect?</b></font><br>
        In general, when you visit our websites and access information you remain anonymous.
        Before we ask you for information, we will explain how this information will be used. We
        will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals
        without your permission. </p>
        <p>Some of our sites require registration to access, although typically all that's
        requested is an e-mail address and some basic information about you, such as job function.
        </p>
        <p>There are occasions where we will ask for additional information. We do this to be able
        to better understand your needs, and provide you with services that we believe may be
        valuable to you. Some examples of information our websites collect are name, address and
        phone number. We give you the opportunity to elect not to receive materials from us. If
        you sign up for an BBL electronic newsletter or e-mail list, each message will include
        instructions on how to &quot;unsubscribe&quot; from that list. </p>
        <p>If any of our websites are developed for children under the age of 13, we will
        encourage them to get their parents' permission before they give us any personal
        information. These websites will also encourage children to use nicknames, instead of
        their given names when and if personal information is collected. </p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff"><b>Protecting your privacy</b></font><br>
        We will take appropriate steps to protect your privacy. Whenever you provide sensitive
        information (for example, a credit card number to make a purchase), we will take
        reasonable steps to protect it, such as encrypting your card number. We will also take
        reasonable security measures to protect your personal information in storage. Credit card
        numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes. </p>
        <p>We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals
        without your permission. However, we may need to provide your name and delivery address to
        third parties that BBL uses for the purposes of delivering specific services to you (e.g.,
        customer support, or a shipping company if you have asked us to send something to you.) </p>
        <p>Our websites may provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those
        websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third party sites. </p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff"><b>Use of cookies</b></font><br>
        BBL websites use cookies for various reasons. Cookies enable us to provide you with a
        better experience by allowing us to understand what areas of the website are of interest
        to our visitors. These cookies do not track individual information. BBL also uses cookies
        when you register for one of our web programs. In this situation, a cookie will store
        useful information that enables our website to remember you when you return to visit us.
        Cookies from BBL websites can only be read by BBL websites. If you choose to disable
        cookies in your browser, you can still access most of our websites. </p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff"><b>Data storage in the U.S.</b></font><br>
        Many of our websites that collect information will store and process that information in
        databases in the United States. </p>
        <p></font><font face="ARIAL" size="2" color="#0000ff"><b>How can you update the personal
        information you have provided to BBL?</b></font><font face="ARIAL" size="2"><br>
        You can help BBL maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying BBL of any changes
        to your address, title, phone number or e-mail address. In some programs, you may do this
        online or through customer support by following the instructions on membership profile
        pages. You may also update your information by e-mailing <a href="mailto:privacy@intel.com">privacy@bblconsulting.com</a>. If at any time you wish to
        stop receiving an electronic newsletter from BBL you can unsubscribe as explained in the
        newsletter or contact us at the above addresses. Please include your name, address, and
        e-mail address, and a description or example of any communication that you no longer wish
        to receive. </p>
