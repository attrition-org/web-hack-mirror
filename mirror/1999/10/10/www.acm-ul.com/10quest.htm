</font><font color="#000080" size="5">10 Questions you Should Ask Before
Choosing An<br>
Alarm Monitoring Company</font></strong> </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#000080" size="5">All
        Central Stations Are Not Alike!</font></b> <font size="4"><b><font color="#8B2B2D">Many alarm dealers take for granted that all
        central stations are alike. Many of our competitors would
        like you to believe that their service is as good as
        ours. You can avoid the costly mistake of choosing a
        substandard monitoring station by asking the right
        questions.</font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#8B2B2D" size="4"><b>Start by asking yourself if the monitoring
        company is competing with you for business. Many third
        party contract monitoring operations handle wholesale and
        retail monitoring, as well as installations, service,
        buying and selling accounts - or they have a &quot;sister
        company&quot; that does. A &quot;wholesale only&quot;
        facility which does not accept retail monitoring or do
        any sales or service is better able to focus on
        supporting your business.</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="4" color="#000080"><b>1. Is the central
        station U.L. Approved?</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><b>U.L. approval is a dealer's only
        guarantee that the central station adheres to industry
        standards for building codes, alarm monitoring equipment,
        power supply back-up systems, record keeping, and quality
        control. If a central station is not U.L. Approved, it
        may not meet accepted industry standards for quality.</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="4" color="#000080"><b>2. How long has the central
        station been at the same location?</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><b>You'll want to choose a well
        established central station that's been at the same
        location for many years. Ask if the owners are on the
        premises and how many times the station has changed
        owners. You might also want to find out how the station
        is funded as well. Stability is an important factor when
        selecting a station you can depend on.</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#8B2B2D" size="4">ACM
        has been in business at the same location with the same
        owners for over 20 years. We are independently owned and
        owner-operated, and are active participants in the
        security industry at city, state and national levels.</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#000080"><b>3. Does the station
        have a redundant computer system?</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#8B2B2D" size="4">It's a fact of life that computer systems go
        down. In the security business, computer redundancy is
        the only way to ensure continuous, uninterrupted
        monitoring. If the central station has a redundant
        computer system, how long does it take to switch from one
        system to the other?</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#000080"><b>4. What about signal
        receiver back-up?</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#8B2B2D" size="4">In a perfect world, everything always
        functions perfectly. In reality, things occasionally
        malfunction. Does the central station provide rollover
        signal receivers in the event of a malfunction? Does it
        rollover within its own unit, or to another unit?</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#000080"><b>5. How does the station
        protect its power supply?</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#8B2B2D" size="4">Continuous, uninterrupted monitoring also
        requires an uninterrupted power supply. Is the station
        backed-up with an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) in
        case of a power outage? Do they have their own generator?
        Does the back-up power system operate automatically, and
        if so, does it have a manual override? Just how many
        sources of power does the station have available?</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#000080"><b>6. How does the central station receive
        its telephone service?</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#8B2B2D" size="4">Even some of the most sophisticated alarm
        systems are still dependent on the good old telephone
        lines. Make sure your central station has adequate
        telephone lines and has taken steps to ensure their
        safety as well. Do the phone lines enter the station
        through underground conduits? What happens if the local
        phone lines fail? Is the telephone system redundant? What
        800-service does the station use and what kind of up-time
        guarantee can they provide? The answers to these
        questions will assure that your subscribers' signals will
        always get through.</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="4" color="#000080">7. What kind of
        screening and training programs has the station
        implemented for its dispatch personnel?</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#8B2B2D" size="4">Your central station should represent your
        company when they are in contact with your subscriber.
        The dispatchers must always respond in a friendly,
        reassuring, and calm, professional manner even under the
        most urgent circumstances. Make sure the central station
        you choose carefully screens their employees and has
        on-going training programs for the dispatchers on
        customer service, signal handling, and attention to
        detail.</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#000080"><b>8. Does the central
        station maintain adequate records?</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#8B2B2D" size="4">Your station should be able to record all
        incoming calls and keep these records on file for a
        reasonable period of time. You never know when you are
        going to need to document an alarm response for your
        customers, public safety officials or the courts. </font><font color="#000080" size="5">We
        keep full history on-line for 1 year.</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#000080"><b>9. Does the central
        station offer regular account activity reports or provide
        dealer access to keep you in control of your accounts?</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#8B2B2D" size="4">Monitoring your account activity is an
        important part of good customer service. Does your
        central station support your efforts by providing timely
        reports or access to desired information? What do they
        charge for this service?</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#000080"><b>10. How well is the facility protected
        from disasters?</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#8B2B2D" size="4">Make sure the central station meets or exceeds
        U.L. requirements for fire protection, electrical
        suppression, lightning strike protection, and other
        emergency situations. The geographic location is also
        important. For example, when it comes to natural
        disasters, Phoenix, Arizona is considered one of the
        safest locations in the United States.</font></b></p>
        <p align="center"><b><font color="#000080" size="5">The
        answers to these questions can make a big difference to
        your subscribers.</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#8B2B2D"><b>Don't
        assume that all central stations offer the same type of
        equipment, similar facilities or adequate training to
        their personnel. You owe it to yourself and to your
        subscribers to shop and compare value, as well as price,
        when selecting an alarm monitoring company.</b></font></p>

        ADVANCED SYSTEM, BECAUSE SECONDS COUNT.</font></b> </p>
