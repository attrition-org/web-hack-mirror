<P><B>As a result of numerous requests from the media, corporations, researchers,
practitioners, and the public, we are in the process of compiling a "Who's
Who in Stress and Behavioral Medicine". This Directory will be cross referenced
by areas of interest, services provided, and geographical location, to
facilitate networking and access to information. It is designed to include
all individuals or organizations offering stress reduction programs and
services, alternative medicine stress reduction approaches, and interests
and activities in some specific stress related area. This Directory will
be useful in supplying accurate lists for those who wish to target an audience
with more specific interests or needs. Information has been obtained from
publications and recommendations and referrals from various health professionals.
Since some of those listed may be unaware of their inclusion, we are attempting
to contact them to obtain updated information to conform with our database.
Registration electronically facilitates this process. There is no fee or
obligation for listing. A periodically updated hard copy being prepared
for libraries and other institutions will be available at markedly reduced
rates for those who participate, and wish to learn of others with similar
interests. For a listing in this Directory, simply supply the information
requested in <A HREF="fellow.htm">Fellowship, Membership,
Subscription Information</A>.</B>

by e-mail. Both of these lists are updated quarterly.</B>
