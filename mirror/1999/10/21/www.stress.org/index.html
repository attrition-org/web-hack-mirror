        niggaz] and the Pakistan Hackuhs Club[niggaz that got
        flow and purpose].</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Lucida Console">anyway, i felt i
        had something to say to society, something worthwhile,
        something that would trigger interest.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Lucida Console">that something,
        is here.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Lucida Console">people, i ask
        that we unite in a common goal. enough bickering within
        and among countries and races. as far as stopping this
        hatred, we obviously have failed to achieve peace over
        centuries, thus our efforts have gone to no avail.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Lucida Console">it is my
        generation that i wish to see these goals accomplished.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Lucida Console">in the digital
        age, we tend to lose touch with ourselves. the internet
        is supposed to provide information, yet it numbs us from
        reality, making us zealots to what really matters.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Lucida Console">oftentimes, we
        are subject to the chicken and the egg theory. does
        society make the idiots? do the idiots make the society?
        curious, isn't it? i doubt any of us have the true
        answers to these questions.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Lucida Console">why should
        individuals below the poverty line suffer an education
        unbefitting of their potential? why should the government
        and our society punish them because of their social
        status? we are doing <strong>nothing</strong> to be
        proactive. it is extremely difficult to &quot;move on up
        out the ghetto&quot; and make a life for yourself. my
        grandfather did it. one of many. everyone will deny it,
        but we are holding them there. this, my friends, is no
        good.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Lucida Console">i think
        america[among other countries] should make it a point to
        correctly educate these individuals and prepare them for
        the world we are in today. if we want to correct the
        current situation - suffering violence and hate within
        the confines of our own species, maybe the answer is
        right under our noses. sometimes there is no way out but
        down. sometimes you need to deal drugs to get money to go
        to college. this is no one's fault but our own.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Lucida Console">we need to give
        these people a better way out.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Lucida Console">crusade alone,
        and i am defeated. crusade together, and we prevail.</font></p>

        yours...</font></p>
