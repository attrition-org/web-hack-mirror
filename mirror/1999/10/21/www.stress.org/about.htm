ABOUT THE INSTITUTE</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="line.gif" HEIGHT=7 WIDTH=535 ALIGN=BOTTOM></CENTER>


<P><B>The American Institute of Stress is a non profit organization founded
in 1978, to serve as a clearing house for information on all stress related
subjects. Our Board of Trustees includes physicians and health professionals
with expertise in various stress related subjects, including the role of
stress in cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and skin disease, immune system
disturbances that contribute to rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disorders,
and a host of viral linked disorders ranging from herpes and the common
cold, to cancer and AIDS. Also represented are prominent lay individuals,
such as Alvin Toffler and Bob Hope, who are interested in the broader aspects
of psychosocial stress and its implications for the future quality of personal
and public life. The late Hans Selye, Norman Cousins and Linus Pauling
were among the founding members. We maintain a large library of information
on all stress related topics, that is constantly updated from both scientific
and lay publications. <A HREF="info.htm">Informational
packets</A> of reprints can be prepared dealing with any subject.</B>

<P><B>Our monthly <A HREF="news.htm">Newsletter
</A>,<IMG SRC="shands.gif" HEIGHT=39 WIDTH=202 ALIGN=CENTER> reports on
the latest</B>

<P><B>advances in stress research and related health topics. <A HREF="fellow.htm">Membership
and Fellowship</A> in The American Institute of Stress includes a subscription
to the Newsletter and reduced rates for other services. In conjuction with
The Biotonus Clinic in Switzerland, we conduct an annual <A HREF="cong.htm">International
Montreux Congress on Stress</A>, which provides cutting edge and state
of-the-art presentations by internationally acclaimed experts. Because
of the marked increase in Workers Compensation and other litigation dealing
with <A HREF="legal.htm">Job Stress</A>, we are frequently
asked for referrals to <A HREF="legal.htm">Expert
Legal Consultants</A> with expertise in this area, as well as the relationship
between stress and various disorders. We are currently in the process of
compiling a <A HREF="who.htm">Directory</A> of "Who's
Who" In Stress and Behavioral Medicine to facilitate networking and serve
as a resource for information on products and services, and we invite you
to participate in this project.</B>
