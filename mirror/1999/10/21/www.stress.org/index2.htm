<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Stress comes in all shapes and sizes, and has
become so pervasive, that it seems to permeate everything and everybody.
There is Job Stress in Lawyers, Doctors, CEO's, Police, Taxi Drivers, Housewives,
Children, Teen Agers, Senior Citizens, etc. There is the stress of Bereavement,
Divorce, Poverty, Social Isolation, Moving, Retirement, Attending School,
Child Rearing, etc. , etc., etc. And there is also heightened media attention
because of growing confirmation of the role of stress in Heart Disease,
Hypertension, Sudden Death, Depression, Anxiety, Smoking, Obesity, Alcoholism,
Substance Abuse, Cancer, Arthritis, Gastrointestinal, Skin, and a host
of infections and immune system disorders.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">It's hard to get through a day without hearing
or reading something about&nbsp;<IMG SRC="congs.gif" HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=120 ALIGN=CENTER>.
<I>Time </I>magazine's June 6, 1983 cover story referred to stress as "The
Epidemic of the 80's", as if it were some kind of new plague. However,
numerous surveys confirm that the problem has progressively escalated since
then. It's hard to get through the day without reading or hearing something
about stress. Why all the commotion? After all, stress has been around
since Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Is it because there is more stress today? Is
contemporary stress somehow different or more dangerous? Is the frenzy
of media attention due to our increasing ability to explain the mechanisms
of many stress induced disorders, and scientifically confirm what were
previously dismissed as old wive's tales? Are unions and workers jumping
on the stress bandwagon because of the growing financial awards for job
stress related injuries? Are corporations attracted because they have increasingly
been held liable for such awards? Or is it because they recognize that
stress management training can be extremely cost effective, not only by
reducing litigation and health expenses, but also absenteeism and worker
turnover, thus improving productivity - and the all important bottom line?</FONT></B>

<P><B>The answer to all of these questions is a very resounding <I><FONT SIZE=+2>"YES!"</FONT></I></B>

<P><B>Stress is an unavoidale consequence of life. Without stress, there
would be no life. However, just as distress can cause disease, there are
good stresses that offset this, and promote wellness. Increased stress
results in increased productivity - up to a point. However, this level
differs for each of us. It's very much like the stress on a violin string.
Not enough produces a dull, raspy sound. Too much makes a shrill, annoying
noise, or causes the string to snap. However, just the right degree can
create magnificent tones. Similarly, we all need to find the proper level
of stress that promotes optimal performance, and enables us to make melodious
music.</B>

<P><B>The American Institute of Stress is committed to exploring and emphasizing
the extraordinary potential for each of us to assume an active role in
preventing disease and promoting health. Good health is more that just
the absence of illness. Rather, it is a very robust state of physical and
emotional well-being, that acknowledges the importance and inseparability
of mind/body relationships. We welcome your joining us in the pursuit of
learning how to harness stress, so that it can work for you, and make you
more productive, rather than self-destructive.</B>
