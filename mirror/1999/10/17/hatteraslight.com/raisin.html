Upon enlisting in the <a href=hnavy/new.cgi>Hatteras Navy</a>, ye'll receive free web space and a free discussion board devoted to the topic of yer choice.  We hope that ye might use it to post any original poetry or prose penned in the context of the classics.   <P> Or choose any of yer passions-- from poetry, to astronomy, to philosophy, to NASCAR, to Beethoven, to cigars, to Jewel, to <i>The Federalist Papers</i>, to windsurfing, to physics, to sailing-- and create a homepage and message board devoted to yer vision. Comb the <a href=http://killdevilhill.com>killdevilhill.com campfires</a>, and invite some friends to join ye upon yer ship's pristine deck, or host a secret society in the Captain's cabin.  The most seaworthy vessles shall be chosen to sail alongside The Jolly Roger in the Carolina Navy.  Argrhrghrhg!

I, too, have been having an intense love affair with the  Lady--she has woven a spell around me that nothing can penetrate.  i  have known Her for all of my 36 years, but have never had the opportunity  to spend more than summers, and an occasional few weeks in the winter  (my favorite time).  i echo yr. sentiments and feel fortunate to have          happened upon a  "kindred spirit".  the visceral feelings i have for  Her, transcend the superficial layers that clog Her surface.  The germ  of wheat lies buried deeply and safely protected.  i long to dig deep  into Her body and become one with that feeling again.  i am planning a  winter visit--i must leave this hell hole called nyc.  perhaps, then, i  will be able to walk with Her, shrouded in fog that holds the key to all  of our musings.....blessed be <P> kezia <P> THE CAPTAIN RESPONDS: Argrhrgrh!  Wish we were all on Nantucket now! Perhaps ye would meet me for a some grog and a few tall seafaring tales-- as tall as the good ship Jolly Roger herself-- at the Brotherhood of Thieves. <P>  From: Susann Pearson <Susann_Pearson@><br> To: drake@jollyroger.com<br> Subject: Your Leanings <P>      Of all the stuff I've read,  I love your little stories.  They are      local colour at it's best.  Very good.  You lean naturally toward the      narrative.  You find your comfort there.  Interesting where writers      find their literary home.  Yours is in the telling of a story.  The      narrative, my boy. <P>      I like the Portrait of Windy "thingy."  It was most refreshing and      lets your linen fly in the breeze.  We got to see it for the      unravished thing it was too.  What a breath of fresh air.  Write on. <P>      S.                 <hr> From: Susann Pearson <Susann_Pearson@><br> To: Drake Raft <drake@jollyroger.com><br> Subject: Re[2]: Your Leanings<br>  <P>      Very well, shipmate.  Like Windy in my ability to bewitch the brother      company perhaps... <P>      But I take no pride in it.  Nor entertain feminine frivolity.  Nor      make a casual affair out of any engagement.  I was a captain of my      galleon long before puberty put your knickers in a twist.  And I      sailed this wickid main long before you tenderfeet put to sea.  Had      my sealegs before you guys weaned yourselves off of Dramamine.  Ahoy,      indeed. <P>      I was salty when you chaps were still in grade school.  My writing      practice has known no respite.  I have been at it since I was thirteen  and my prow is keen.  She sails like the devil and fetches anything she      looks at, gentlemen.  This I can tell ye with a gusto. <P>      Am thoroughy impressed with what you et al have done on the Net.  A bracing      BRAVO from Washington DC. <P>      The figurative brigantine is all the rage.      Let it beckon the slacker punks to the written page. <P>      Let it make of them readers of great literature.  And you and I can      keep writing it in the mean time... <P>      Write on.  and <P>      Fair winds and following seas, S.  <P> <hr> From: "C. Lyle" <cylyle@><br> To: drake@jollyroger.com<br> Subject: The Word<br> <P> I can't believe that I sat here and read this whole thing (<a href=http://jollyroger.com/rogerlodge.html>The Drake Raft Field Trip</a>). It's almost 3:00 am and I don't usually read this much this late. I would normally copy it and read it later, but I just couldn't stop reading. I know I will be thinking about this for days to come. The story comes at you from all angles, and has an incredible mixture of ideas. I love where you seem to be going with this. I can't wait to read the rest of the story.  <P><i><blockquote>       and it had that fresh smell to it-- you know, that one fresh      springy smell that doesn't really smell like anything except for      itself. You know the kind I mean, and if you don't,      you're missing out , so first chance you have, go out sometime right      after an afternoon June thunderstorm, and      breathe deeply, and then you'll know what I mean.                      </blockquote></i><P>    Yes, I know what you mean. It revives your soul and makes you want to live forever.<P>                             Crissala                                   <hr> <P> From: Denise Wagner  <dw0006@student.luzerne.edu><br> To: becket@jollyroger.com<br> Subject: Highlander sends Christmas greetings <P> Becket:<P> Highlander sends her most hearty Christmas greetings to you and all your crew.  May this Christmas find you home and happy with the ones that you love most.  May the winds blow and may there be sunny skies, and may always find your port in the storm.  During this semester I have read your poems and Drake's and was moved to tears by what I read.  Thank God someone in this world has the courage to write what both of you do, and I would sometime in the future hope to read some of Eliot's poems.  May God bless all of you, and have a happy and safe Christmas and New Year Holiday season.<P> Until I hear from you again, May the Good Lord bless of all of ye.  As for me I will be finishing up my finals on December 17, 1998, so you won't be hearing from me for awhile.  But that doesn't mean I won't be thinking about you.   Now as for me I have some gift wrapping to do, and my best    tartan to press off.  I hope you hear my bagpipes playing.... <P>Love to all,<P>                                HIGHLANDER                                              </center> </td></tr></table> <a href=nantucket.html><center>William Shakespeare Discussions</center></a>
