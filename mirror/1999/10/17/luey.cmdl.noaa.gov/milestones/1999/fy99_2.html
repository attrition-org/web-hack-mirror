<p><font face="Arial">Q2: Report an improved budget of atmospheric methane, based on
trends, lab studies, and modeling. (CMDL, E. Dlugokencky and P. Tans)</font></b></p>
<i>

<p><font face="Arial">Purpose of the Research</font></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The amount of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) in Earth's
atmosphere has more than doubled since preindustrial times. This increase is responsible
for about 20% of the estimated change in direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic
greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, methane reacts with ozone-destroying free chlorine
in the stratosphere, converting it to hydrochloric acid which does not react with ozone
thus aiding in the rehabilitation of the ozone layer. Methane continues to increase in the
1990s, but the rate of increase has slowed. A better understanding of the global budgets
of gases such as methane is needed in order to provide accurate information for policy
makers. The analysis was performed to gain a better understanding of how total emissions
to the atmosphere have changed in recent decades, and to try to understand the reasons for
the decreasing growth rate in atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub>.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The SP element is to PREDICT AND ASSESS DECADAL TO
CENTENNIAL CHANGE, with objectives to CHARACTERIZE THE FORCING AGENTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
and to GUIDE THE REHABILITATION OF THE OZONE LAYER. This effort contributes to these
objectives by characterizing the concentrations and growth rates of methane which is both
a major greenhouse gas and a controlling factor in ozone depletion. The results of this
research will be considered in the next IPCC assessment of the science of global climate
change, and the WMO/UNEP assessment of ozone depletion, which are PM&#146;s for these
objectives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Research Efforts</font></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img src="methane1.gif" align="right" width="500" height="584"><font
face="Arial">Methane measurements were made from air samples collected as part of a
globally distributed network of air sampling sites operated by the CMDL. Measurements from
about 60 sampling sites were used to calculate global averages as a function of time.
Globally averaged methane data were used in a model (along with annual increases
calculated from the same measurements and the methane lifetime) to calculate total annual
emissions to the atmosphere for the period 1984 to 1996. The results suggest that if the
globally averaged concentration of hydroxyl (OH), which chemically removes methane from
the atmosphere, has remained constant (for which there is independent evidence), then
total emissions of CH<sub>4</sub> to the atmosphere have been nearly constant at -540
Million Metric Tons CH<sub>4</sub> per year (red filled circles in bottom panel of the
figure). Further, the results show that the decreasing growth rate of methane reflects an
approach to steady-state on a time scale comparable to methane's lifetime of about 9 years
(dashed curve in top panel). Chemical loss of methane to OH is proportional to the methane
concentration and continues to grow as methane increases (cyan triangles in lower panel).
At steady-state, emissions would exactly balance losses. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Customers, Dissemination and Use of Results </font></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The measurements are used in chemical and radiative
transfer models for studies of anthropogenic climate change, especially for projecting
future greenhouse warming based on expected atmospheric concentrations of CH<sub>4 </sub>and
other gases. They are also used in chemical models of stratospheric ozone which predict
the recovery of the ozone layer. These model results are used in assessments, for example,
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the WMO/UNEP Scientific
Assessments of Stratospheric Ozone. The main result of this work will be useful for policy
makers in greenhouse gas emission stabilization considerations and in assessing the
effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol regulating substances that deplete the ozone layer.</font></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Significance of the Work</font></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The work attempts to explain the decreasing growth
rate of atmospheric methane first reported in <i>Nature</i> (Vol.358, pp. 313-316) by CMDL
in 1992. Previously the decreasing growth rate was thought to be due to either decreased
CH<sub>4</sub> emissions or increased tropospheric OH; in reality, both have remained
approximately constant. The result could have policy implications. Extrapolating constant
global emissions and OH into the future suggests that globally averaged methane will
increase from 1730 ppb in 1996 to a steady-state maximum of about 1800 ppb over the next
few decades, with little change in the contribution of methane to the greenhouse effect.
This assumes that the original key assumptions were correct, and that neither emissions
nor the globally averaged OH concentration change in the future. Such a scenario was not
considered in the last (1995) IPCC assessment and would reduce model-estimated future
warming. A future constant methane scenario was considered in the 1998 WMO/UNEP Ozone
Assessment and indicated that recovery of the ozone layer would be delayed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Project Status and Outcome</font></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The project was completed and published in <i>Nature</i>,
A Continuing Decline in the Growth Rate of the Atmospheric Methane Burden, 4 June 1998,
pp. 447-450.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Future Activities</font></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The high-precision CH<sub>4</sub> measurements will
continue, and they will continue to be analyzed by CMDL scientists and made available to
other researchers. Other parameters revealed by the measurements such as spatial
gradients, seasonal cycles, and comparisons with other trace gases will be investigated in
detail. The most important element in this effort will remain maintenance of the network
for the collection of high-quality air samples and the subsequent measurement of the
samples for CH<sub>4</sub> and other species.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Q2: Obtain ground-based and airborne measurements of
the climate-forcing properties of atmospheric aerosols over the Indian Ocean during the
international Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX). These measurements will help improve the
global models used to calculate the climatic effects of aerosols in a region where
anthropogenic emissions are predicted to increase substantially in the future. (CMDL, J.
Ogren)</font></b></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Purpose of the Research</font></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The purpose of this effort is to characterize the
radiative properties of atmospheric aerosols in a region where anthropogenic emissions are
predicted to increase substantially in the future. Prior to INDOEX, little was known about
these properties, but exploratory missions had documented the presence of high levels of
pollution over the Indian Ocean, far from land. The goal is to improve global models that
are used to calculate the climatic effects of aerosols, by providing reliable
determinations of the specific aerosol radiative properties that are used in the models.
More information on INDOEX is available at <a HREF="http://www-indoex.ucsd.edu/">http://www-indoex.ucsd.edu</a>.</font></p>

relative humidity, were deployed on the NCAR C-130 research aircraft and at the Kaashidoo
Climate Observatory (KCO) in the Maldive Islands for INDOEX (see photos below). The
systems were operated for all 18 of the C-130 research flights and for a 7-week intensive

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Customers, Dissemination and Use of Results </font></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The primary customers are the participants of
INDOEX, in particular the global modeling community, which needs reliable values of
aerosol radiative properties in order to calculate the radiative effects of anthropogenic
aerosols over the Indian Ocean. The end results of the models are used in assessments such
as the IPCC and provide useful information for policy makers regarding climate
predictions. Preliminary results were communicated at workshops during the field campaign.
Final results will be provided to the INDOEX data base, and will be reported in the
refereed literature.</font></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Significance of the Work</font></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">These are the first airborne measurements of aerosol
light scattering and absorption coefficients over the Indian Ocean. They are also the
first measurements of aerosol hygroscopic growth over the Indian Ocean. The measurements
are significant because they will allow direct measurements of aerosol radiative
properties, rather than educated guesses, to be used in the models that evaluate aerosol
radiative forcing of climate.</font></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Project Status and Outcome</font></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The last research flight was on March 25, and the
last measurements at KCO were on March 29, 1999. The field data have just been received at
CMDL. Preliminary evaluation of the data indicates that the quality and quantity is
sufficient to meet the goal of providing modelers with reliable values of aerosol
radiative properties over the Indian Ocean.</font></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Future Activities</font></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The next step is to screen the data, apply
calibration corrections, and provide a clean, final data set to the INDOEX data center.
Our data analysis and publication efforts will focus on (a) summary statistics of aerosol
radiative properties in the INDOEX region, and (b) comparison of measured and modeled
values of aerosol radiative properties during INDOEX. Because of the unique location of
KCO, with very clean conditions part of the year and very polluted conditions during the
northeast monsoon, a number of research groups in the U.S. and abroad are interested in
continued atmospheric sampling there. We plan to rebuild our sampling system to make it
more suitable for extended operation with minimal on-site attention, and to operate it at
KCO for a full year if funding can be arranged.</font></p>
