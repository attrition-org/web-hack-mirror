<p class="HTMLBody"><b><font face="Arial">Q3:&nbsp; Report on
an intercomparison of data from the new high-resolution ultraviolet
spectroradiometer recently installed at Boulder, Colorado, and a similar
instrument located at Mauna Loa, Hawaii.&nbsp; One
year of simultaneous UV spectra and ozone data will be analyzed and the
relationship between UV and ozone variations will be derived.&nbsp; (CMDL, B. Bodhaine)</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><font face="Arial">Purpose</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This research is related to the goal: Guide the
Rehabilitation of the Ozone Layer, in the NOAA Strategic Plan element: Predict
and Assess Decadal to Centennial Change. Performance measures include the use of
the data for international assessments of the status of the ozone layer. Depletion of the global ozone layer
has caused increases in ultraviolet radiation at the surface of the earth. However, not until recently has this correlation been clearly shown, for
example at Mauna Loa Observatory where the atmosphere is free of the interfering
effects of clouds and aerosols most of the time.&nbsp; The main goal of CMDL’s UV program is to understand the effects of
atmospheric ozone changes on surface spectral UV irradiance.&nbsp; The measurement of UV spectra (1 nm resolution) allows the calculation of
various weighted response functions (action spectra) in the UV region.&nbsp; The most common of these is the erythema action spectrum,
defined to approximate the response of human skin to UV radiation.&nbsp; Another goal of the UV monitoring program is to detect possible long-term
changes in UV irradiance related to any long-term changes in ozone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because of the limited calibration accuracy of UV spectroradiometers
(about 3%) it could take on the order of a decade to detect a long-term trend in
UV.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><font face="Arial">Efforts</font></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">UV spectroradiometers have been
operating at Mauna Loa since July 1995, and at Boulder since June 1998.&nbsp; Clear mornings were selected for the Mauna Loa data, and clear mornings
or clear afternoons were selected for the Boulder data.&nbsp; Total ozone data were obtained with Dobson spectrophotometers for these
clear conditions at both sites.&nbsp; A
time series was constructed for UV irradiance and ozone for each site.&nbsp; Changes in UV irradiance were compared with changes in ozone at various
solar zenith angles.&nbsp; As expected, a
strong negative correlation is found between UV irradiance and ozone, with a
radiative amplification factor (the fractional increase in UV associated with a
decrease in ozone) of about 1.1-1.2 for both sites. Because of the limited data
sets at Mauna Loa and Boulder, no long-term trend can yet be detected.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><font face="Arial">Customers</font></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Data on ozone-UV correlations are
used in the WMO/UNEP Assessments of Ozone Depletion and by researchers who are
developing atmospheric UV radiation models.&nbsp; These data are important because only a limited number of surface-based
spectral UV measurements are available.&nbsp; Other
uses of these UV data sets are to predict the consequences of changes in
atmospheric ozone, and to predict the effects of these changes on plant and
animal life.&nbsp; Finally, these data
can be used by other researchers who wish to calibrate their instruments by
comparison with ours.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><font face="Arial">Significance</font></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">This effort is important because it
relates the UV irradiance at the surface to changes in total atmospheric ozone.&nbsp;
Stratospheric ozone loss and its eventual recovery can have a profound
effect on life on earth.&nbsp; Since
different life forms have different UV action spectra, it is important to
measure spectral UV to determine the effects of changes of UV on these different
life forms.&nbsp; In addition, it is important to measure spectral UV
irradiance and understand the effects of other atmospheric constituents on the
radiation budget.&nbsp; For example,
aerosols and clouds can have a large effect on UV and these effects are not
currently well understood.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><i>Results&nbsp;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Since the project was instituted at
Mauna Loa in July 1995, an almost continuous spectral UV data set has been
obtained at this pristine site.&nbsp; This is one of the best clear sky spectral
UV data sets available.&nbsp; The measurements in Boulder have also been
successful following installation of the instrument in June 1998.&nbsp;
Comparison of data at the two sites is difficult for a number of reasons, least
of which is the altitude difference (3.4 km at Mauna Loa, 1.7 km at Boulder),
causing reduced, but characterizable, UV at Boulder owing to additional
molecular scattering, and the difference in latitude (19°N at Mauna Loa and 45°N
at Boulder).&nbsp; While the Mauna Loa Observatory site generally has clear and
clean skies throughout the morning hours, Boulder often clouds over several
hours after sunrise, although some days may be cloud-free the entire day.&nbsp;
Even partially cloudy skies will cause scattered UV to enter the field of view
giving results which are difficult to interpret without complete
characterization of the clouds.&nbsp; In addition, Boulder is generally
subjected to some level of atmospheric aerosol (sub-micrometer sized suspended
particles both of a natural haze origin and related to anthropogenic pollution)
which result in absorption of UV, again in a fashion which is impossible to
characterize without complete information on the aerosol particles.&nbsp; While
these data will be compared scientifically in the future, for preliminary
purposes we can compare data obtained at the two sites at the same sun angle.&nbsp;
For the 6 months of data obtained in Boulder at CMDL’s old location in 1998,
prior to the move to the new building, adequate clear sky data are available at
Boulder for a solar zenith angle (SZA) of 70° (about 2.5 hr after sunrise or
before sunset).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><br>
By integration of the multi-wavelength data over the erythemal spectrum one can
compare, for example, the sunburning capacity of&nbsp; UV radiation at the two
sites.&nbsp; Figure 1 shows the observed relationship between total column
ozone, as measured by Dobson spectrophotometers, with the erythemal UV observed
at a SZA of 70° on clear mornings at both sites.&nbsp; Data obtained at Mauna
Loa are shown for the entire 1998 year by red circles. The data obtained at the
same SZA on clear mornings at Boulder for the second half of 1998 when the
instrument was operating are shown in blue triangles.&nbsp; For comparison,
those Mauna Loa data also obtained during the second half of the year are also
indicated by red triangles.&nbsp; First of all the correlation of high erythemal
UV with low ozone is obvious.&nbsp; Second, the amount of UV is higher at&nbsp;
Mauna Loa, for the same SZA and ozone amount, owing to the reduced atmospheric
pressure, as expected.&nbsp; Finally, the scatter in the data is larger at
Boulder, probably related to atmospheric aerosol which is nearly absent at Mauna
Loa.<br>

The two extremely low ozone
(230-240 DU) - high UV (3-3.2 microwatts cm<sup>-2</sup>) events at Boulder both
occurred on November 30 (70° SZA in the morning and afternoon).&nbsp; Unusually low ozone values were observed at Boulder during November 1998,
as can be seen in Figure 2 where the ozone and UV data are shown versus time
during the latter half of 1998.&nbsp; This
condition is believed to be related to the transport of low ozone air from low
latitudes during November, which is then superimposed on already low ozone
related to the depletion of ozone by halocarbons.</font></p>

<font face="Arial">The current spectroradiometer in Boulder is a temporary
instrument which will be replaced by a new instrument on the roof of the new
NOAA building in the autumn of 1999.&nbsp; This will complete the installation
of new instruments, consisting of two research grade UV spectroradiometers built
around Bentham double monochromators, at Mauna Loa and Boulder.&nbsp; Research
will continue on the relationship between UV irradiance and atmospheric ozone,
and the time series of UV spectral irradiance will be continued.&nbsp; Since
Boulder is affected by clouds and aerosols on a much larger scale than Mauna
Loa, through intercomparison of the data sets, an effort will be initiated to
determine the effects of clouds and aerosols on surface UV irradiance, an
important current consideration in UV model development.</font>

  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The NOAA Strategic Plan element to which this research
  relates is to PREDICT AND ASSESS DECADAL TO CENTENNIAL CHANGE, with the
  objective to CHARACTERIZE THE FORCING AGENTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.&nbsp; This effort contributes to the objective by characterizing the
  radiative properties of a major forcing agent of climate change, namely
  anthropogenic aerosols.&nbsp; The
  results of this research will be considered in the next IPCC assessment of the
  science of global climate change, which is the Performance Measure for this
  objective. Characterization of
  the radiative properties of aerosols includes a description of their
  horizontal, vertical, and temporal variability.&nbsp; NOAA's
  aerosol/climate monitoring program is one of the few systematic efforts
  underway to provide long-term, reliable determinations of aerosol radiative
  properties that are used in global models of human effects on climate.&nbsp; This particular milestone was undertaken to provide the modeling
  community with statistically-useful summaries of the variability of aerosol
  radiative properties, for subsequent comparison with model assumptions and
  predictions.</font>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Research Efforts</i>&nbsp;</font>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">CMDL and its collaborators have been monitoring aerosol
  radiative properties at several marine and continental locations, including
  Sable Island, Nova Scotia; Bondville, Illinois; Cheeka Peak, Washington;
  Barrow, Alaska; Lamont, Oklahoma, and in central Hungary.&nbsp; Airborne surveys of these same properties using the NOAA P-3 research
  aircraft have been conducted during three campaigns and the results have been
  used to determine how representative the surface-based measurements are of the
  radiative properties of the total atmospheric aerosol distribution.&nbsp; This milestone involves evaluation and publication of the results from
  these measurements.</font></p>
