<p><font face="Arial"><b>Q1: Publish results of inverse modeling of global CO<sub>2</sub>
observations, showing that ecosystems in North America constitute a large net annual sink
of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. In particular, during 1988-1992, the southern half of the
North American continent appears to have been absorbing an amount of CO<sub>2</sub>
comparable to that produced by fossil fuel burning. (CMDL, P. Tans)</b></font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Evidence has been accumulating over the last decade
that a significant fraction (perhaps about one third) of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by the
burning of fossil fuels is being absorbed by the land masses at temperate latitudes in the
northern hemisphere.&nbsp; This is commonly called the northern hemisphere terrestrial CO<sub>2</sub>
&quot;sink&quot;. A short synopsis, with references, of the various independent lines of
evidence pointing in that direction is given by Tans and White (1998).</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">During 1997 and 1998 a new step was taken in
deciphering the global balance sheet of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp; For the first
time the Northern Hemisphere terrestrial sink was specified a bit further: we found that
the North American continent played the leading role (Fan et al., 1998).&nbsp; Since 1995
we have been participating in the Carbon Modeling Consortium, centered at Princeton
University, NJ. &nbsp; The consortium develops models of the global atmospheric and
oceanic transport of chemical compounds.&nbsp; These models are applied to observations of
CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere and oceans in order to uncover the spatial and temporal
patterns of sources and sinks that give rise to the observed concentration patterns.&nbsp;
Because atmospheric transport is generally much faster in the east-west than in the
north-south direction the spatial pattern that results from sources and sinks is mostly
north-south, and is &quot;smeared out&quot; in the east-west direction.&nbsp; This implies
that it is much harder to uncover east-west source patterns than it is to deduce the
sources and sinks as a function of latitude.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In the paper by Fan et al. the annual average CO<sub>2</sub>
concentrations for the period 1988-1992 are interpreted by two atmospheric models
(originally developed at NOAA/GFDL).&nbsp; The observations are from the first release of
the Globalview-CO<sub>2</sub> data set maintained at NOAA/CMDL (1996).&nbsp; Globalview
puts together as many well-calibrated data as possible from international collaborating
laboratories.&nbsp; Annual average CO<sub>2</sub> sources and sinks are deduced separately
for three areas: North America, Northern Eurasia, and the rest of the land area of the
world.&nbsp; Exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> with the global oceans is prescribed according to
two different scenarios: one based on global observations of the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>
in surface ocean waters, leading to the transfer of gas across the surface (Takahashi et
al., 1997), and one based on a biogeochemical ocean model developed at Princeton. &nbsp;
This leads to four combinations (two models with two prescribed oceanic sink patterns) to
interpret the atmospheric data in terms of land sources and sinks. A terrestrial carbon
sink of about 1.6 Pg (1.6 billion metric tonnes) of carbon per year in North America
stands out in all of these four cases (see Table).</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">If the large terrestrial CO<sub>2</sub> sink in
North America is borne out by further measurements, it has tremendous potential
implications for carbon management.&nbsp; In the paper by Fan et al. we mention as
possible explanations the ongoing regrowth of previously cut forests along the east coast
of the U.S., or the fertilization of the biosphere by higher atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
concentration and/or the wide application of nitrate.&nbsp; It is also possible that there
is a significant buildup of organic matter in agricultural soils resulting from a
combination of management practices including fertilizer application.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q1: Report on findings of the 1997 POLARIS field campaign
investigating Arctic ozone losses. (CMDL, J. Elkins and S. Oltmans; AL, D. Fahey; OGP, J.
Levy) </strong></font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><img src="polaris.jpeg" alt="Polaris Image" align="right" WIDTH="472" HEIGHT="682"><font face="Arial">The Photochemistry of Ozone Loss in Arctic Region in Summer (POLARIS)
airborne campaign was undertaken in 1997 to investigate the seasonal behavior of polar
stratospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) as it changes from very high concentrations in spring
down to very low concentrations in autumn (top panel, red line indicates mean O<sub>3</sub>
column densities for the period of 1978-94). Ozone loss results from catalytic loss cycles
involving reactions of total chemically active nitrogen (NO<sub>y</sub>), odd hydrogen (HO<sub>x</sub>),
and total halogens (Cl<sub>y</sub>, from CFCs, etc. and Br<sub>y</sub>, e.g. from halons,
etc.). The enhanced polar summertime loss is attributed to the increased role of very
reactive nitrogen (nitric oxide (NO) + nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)) in O<sub>3 </sub>loss
cycles during periods of prolonged solar illumination such as occur at high latitudes
during summer. The accuracy with which current photochemical models can describe this
large, natural O<sub>3</sub> loss serves as an indication of how well the role of
increased stratospheric reactive nitrogen from aircraft emissions can be qualified. One of
the major goals of POLARIS was to evaluate the level of agreement between model
predictions and observations for the 1998 and upcoming 2002 UNEP/WMO Scientific
Assessments of Stratospheric Ozone Depletion, an objective of the NOAA Strategic Plan and
a major performance measure quantified.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The POLARIS campaign was co-sponsored by NASA&#146;s
Office of Mission to Planet Earth and Office of Aeronautics, and NOAA. The mission was
based primarily out of Fairbanks, Alaska during three deployment periods (April-May,
June-July, and September), with additional flights conducted from Barber&#146;s Point,
Hawaii, and Moffett Field, California. Two platforms, including the NASA ER-2 high
altitude aircraft (bottom panel) and the Observations of the Middle Stratosphere (OMS)
balloon gondola, were employed to operate a total of 24 sampling instruments. A NOAA
scientist was the mission scientist. Other NOAA scientists operated three instruments on
the NASA ER-2 aircraft (reactive nitrogen, dual-beam UV-absorption O<sub>3</sub>
photometer, and the Airborne Chromatograph for Atmospheric Trace Species-IV (ACATS-IV)
instruments), two instruments on the OMS balloon gondola (Lightweight Airborne
Chromatograph Experiment, LACE and water vapor instruments), and one from the ground
(ozonesondes). Two theory teams from NOAA also were involved in the mission. The major
customers of this research are modelers that examine anthropogenic perturbations to the
stratospheric ozone layer and policy makers involved in regulatory decisions involving
future aircraft emissions.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Using the POLARIS data set, photochemical models
were able to predict the observed NO<sub>2</sub> to NO ratio and the observed ratio of
very reactive nitrogen to the total chemically active nitrogen in the atmosphere. This
agreement indicates that key models accurately represent important aspects of the reactive
nitrogen photochemistry in the lower stratosphere. Calculations constrained by <i>in situ</i>
measurements of nitrogen, hydrogen, and chlorine species show that very reactive nitrogen
dominates the destruction of ozone in the summer polar stratosphere, with significant
contributions from the odd hydrogen cycle. This result is significant because an earlier
campaign (in 1995-1996) showed that the chemistry for odd hydrogen was the dominant
destruction cycle in the midlatitude stratosphere. POLARIS measurements were completed in
1997, a scientific meeting was held in June 1998, a CD-ROM with all of the data from
observations and some model results was distributed in July 1998, a special AGU session
was held in December 1998, and papers are currently being submitted to peer-reviewed
publications. Major ozone depletion was observed in March-April 1997 (top panel, black
dots). These events have become more frequent over the past few years. An upcoming
campaign, SAGE-3 Ozone Loss Validation Experiment (SOLVE) in 1999-2000, will offer another
opportunity to examine polar stratospheric ozone loss but this time during late winter and
early spring.</font></p>
