Publish new estimates, based on measurements of the atmospheric burden of
human-produced chlorine and bromine compounds, of how the threat posed to the
ozone-layer by these chemicals will change in the near future.&nbsp; These
results indicate that their aggregate ozone-destroying capacity, which has been
declining since 1994, will not continue at the current rate unless future
emissions of these gases become smaller. (CMDL, S. Montzka)</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">This research
is related to the goal: Guide the Rehabilitation of the Ozone Layer, in the NOAA
Strategic Plan Element: Predict and Assess Decadal to Centennial Change.&nbsp;
Performance measures include the use of the data for international assessments
of the potential future state of the ozone layer.&nbsp; The data also allow for
an assessment of international policy measures designed to reduce the amount of
ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><i><font face="Arial">Efforts:</font></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">Atmospheric
measurements of chlorofluorocarbons and other important trace gases have been
performed on a regular basis at remote ground-stations in both hemispheres since
the late 1980s and early 1990s.&nbsp; Because accurate and stable reference
standards are maintained for these gases, the measurements allow the detection
of small changes in the concentrations of trace gases responsible for delivering
the majority of the chlorine and bromine to the stratosphere.&nbsp; The data
allows the inference of how the concentration of these ozone-depleting halogens
will change in the stratosphere.&nbsp; This information is essential for
predicting how ozone concentrations might change in the future.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><i><font face="Arial">Customers:</font></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">Customers on
the national and international scale include the general public, scientists, and
policy makers who are concerned about ozone depletion and its recovery.&nbsp;
Scientists use the data to further understand atmospheric chemistry and mixing
processes, and also incorporate them into modeling studies to predict the state
of the ozone layer in the future.&nbsp; The general public and policy makers use
the data to gauge the effectiveness of national and international legislation
designed to reduce the amount of ozone-depleting chemicals in the atmosphere.&nbsp;
The data were published in the 22 April 1999 issue of the international journal <i>Nature</i>.&nbsp;
Furthermore, the data have been used in the <i>WMO/UNEP Scientific Assessment of
Ozone Depletion</i> in 1995 and 1998.&nbsp; Earlier reports using these data
appeared in the Journals <i>Science</i>, <i>Nature</i>, <i>Geophysical Research
Letters</i>, and the <i>Journal of Geophysical Research</i> in 1993 and 1994.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><i><font face="Arial">Significance:</font></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">These data
provide the basis for understanding how stratospheric ozone might change in the
future.&nbsp; They are necessary for understanding how international legislation
has influenced the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere.&nbsp;
Although the data show that the overall burden of ozone-depleting halogen has
declined by about 3% since the beginning of 1994, several flags regarding this
trend were noted.&nbsp; The current decrease arises mostly from the rapid
decline observed for one particular gas, and the influence of this gas will
become much smaller soon.&nbsp; Furthermore, emissions of some important
substances have not decreased in response to production bans in developed
countries.&nbsp; Because of these trends, and those for other gases, it was
concluded that halocarbon emissions are not yet small enough to sustain a
continued decline in the atmospheric burden of ozone-depleting halogen.&nbsp;
Only with continued declines in emissions will recovery of ozone be possible.</font>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><i><font face="Arial">Success
and Completion:</font></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">This work has
been a success because it has provided accurate information to policy makers,
scientists, and the general public.&nbsp; Much of the data collected by this
group is not available anywhere else, and yet is essential for understanding the
future of the ozone layer.&nbsp; Accordingly this work continues to address the
NOAA goal of Guiding the Rehabilitation of the Ozone Layer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reports
such as this latest one in <i>Nature</i> have noted important features in the
concentration of these gases as measured at CMDL.&nbsp; Although each of these
reports stands alone, the ultimate goal of guiding the rehabilitation of the
ozone layer is far from over.&nbsp; Continued monitoring will allow for
identifying when additional milestones in the concentration and trends of
ozone-depleting substances are reached.&nbsp; The future abundance of
ozone-depleting substances is far from certain, many possible paths could be
followed (see the figure).&nbsp; Only&nbsp; with continued monitoring of these
trace gases can we gauge how far down the road to recovery we have come, or if a
different road needs to be taken.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><i><font face="Arial">Future
Activities:</font></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">In addition
to continuing measurements of CFCs and related trace gases, measurements of
trace gases that have large non-anthropogenic sources, such as the methyl
halides, will be undertaken.&nbsp; Concentrations of these gases can change as a
result of interannual variability and/or climate change and they contribute
substantial amounts of chlorine and bromine to the stratosphere.&nbsp; Data for
these gases is critical to provide an accurate understanding of trends in the
total burden of ozone-depleting gases in light of the changes achieved through
international legislation.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Q4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Report on the initial results of
a new network of UV spectral radiometers at Barrow and Nome, Alaska, and St.
Paul in the Pribilof of Islands, which provides important ultraviolet
radiation monitoring of the Arctic region and will aid in developing an
understanding of the impact of ozone-related UV increases on the Arctic
ecology. (CMDL, R. Tatusko)</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><i>Purpose:</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">This research
is related to the goal: Guide the Rehabilitation of the Ozone Layer, in the NOAA
Strategic Plan Element: Predict and Assess Decadal to Centennial Change.&nbsp;
Performance measures include the use of the data for international assessments.&nbsp;
There has been a significant
change in Arctic ozone levels, particularly during the past decade.&nbsp;
Changes in Arctic ozone have been rapid in recent years and long-term
downward trends have been observed throughout the Arctic over the past 15 years,
along with regional areas of extremely low ozone observed primarily in the
springtime. These past and possible future changes make the Arctic a
particularly important area to investigate changes in the distribution of UV.&nbsp;
Current predictions for future Arctic ozone levels indicate continued depletion
for at least ten years and a very slow and possibly incomplete recovery.&nbsp;
The observed changes in ozone have been accompanied by increased UV radiation in
the spring, a time when biological systems are most sensitive to the harmful
aspects of UV.&nbsp; The highest springtime UV levels measured at Barrow were
recorded in March 1997.&nbsp; The existence of decreasing ozone in the Arctic
over the next decade, coupled with the potential impact of increasing UV to
Arctic ecosystems, requires the continued observation of UV in this region.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">In September 1997, with support from the
NOAA Arctic Research Initiative (ARI), CMDL took the first step to address the
need for improved UV measurements in the Arctic with the deployment of two
instruments at its baseline Observatory in Barrow.&nbsp; This was described in
last year’s milestone report.&nbsp; This year’s efforts were devoted to
expanding the coverage for obtaining UV measurements in order to provide
critically needed data over a larger region of Alaska.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><i>Efforts:</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">In June 1998, multi-channel UV
instruments were deployed at Nome and St. Paul in Alaska (see figure).&nbsp; The
instruments are slightly different from the one in Barrow (installed in
September 1997) in that they measure UV irradiance at wavelengths of 305 nm, 313
nm, 320 nm, 380 nm, and across the PAR band (400-700 nm).&nbsp; Coincident
meteorological information is available to provide a broader climatological
context for evaluating the radiation balance at both sites.&nbsp; Because an
Internet connection is not yet possible at either St. Paul or Nome, data are
downloaded on a weekly basis via a telephone modem connection.&nbsp; Daily plots
are generated and reviewed to insure that the instruments are functioning
properly and that the data look reasonable.&nbsp; Data are available to any user
upon request through CMDL, and efforts will be made over the next year to format
and transfer the data on a regular basis to the UV data center in Toronto,
Canada.</font></p>

</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The scientific community was informed
about this UV program at two international professional meetings:&nbsp; the
European Conference on Atmospheric UV Radiation (ECUV) in Helsinki, Finland
(June 1998) and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) in
Birmingham, England (July 1999).&nbsp; In addition, an overview of the program
was provided to the Alaska Native Science Commission (ANSC) in Anchorage and the
Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) representative in Nome.&nbsp; This activity
will also contribute to the next phase of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment
Program (AMAP) and the International Arctic Science Commission (IASC).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><i>Significance:</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">This UV network is significant in three
respects:&nbsp; (1) it addresses the sparcity of UV monitoring in Alaska.&nbsp;
Prior to 1997, the only UV monitoring that existed in Alaska was in Fairbanks
(University of Alaska) and Anchorage (Denali National Park, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency);&nbsp; (2) this network enhances the ability to monitor over
an area of high variability of and potentially large changes in UV reaching the
Earth’s surface. Current predictions for future Arctic ozone levels indicate
continued depletion for at least ten years and a very slow and possibly
incomplete recovery.&nbsp; This network will enable scientists to monitor not
only these changes in ozone across a broader area of Alaska but also any
concomitant increases in UV; (3) this network provides greater utility to
scientists who will be conducting impacts related research on Arctic ecosystems,
especially in the marine environment.&nbsp; The fisheries of the North Pacific
Ocean and the Bering Sea are among the most productive in the world.&nbsp; Any
significant changes to the marine primary production in these waters as a result
of increasing UV could have deleterious effects to the entire infrastructure on
which Alaska and, to a larger extent, the U.S. fishing industry thrives.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><i>Success:</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The deployment of two UV instruments at
Nome and St. Paul, to supplement the 1997 installation in Barrow, has now been
completed.&nbsp; A dedicated UV monitoring network is now in place, which
provides the basis for future research efforts as described in the next section.&nbsp;
The relationship between UV and ozone has been studied for the Barrow site using
both Dobson and satellite (TOMS) ozone data. By using the multiwavelength
capability of the UV instrument it is possible to minimize the effects of
clouds, and to estimate the effect of changes in total ozone on UV.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A study was performed on a Siberian forest fire smoke event that significantly
reduced UV radiation on a clear day at Barrow, September 22, 1998.&nbsp; Surface
UV data were compared with similar data on September 30, 1998, another clear day
on which there was no smoke.&nbsp; Finally, a study was performed in which
spectral UV data from the Barrow instrument were compared with surface UV
radiation predicted from NASA satellite measurements.&nbsp; Significant
differences were found, and work is in progress with NASA to provide ground
truth data to help with the development of their retrieval algorithms.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><i>Next Steps:</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Future efforts will be devoted to
analysis of the data and are three-fold: (1) to assess the variability of UV-B,
UV-A, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the Alaskan Arctic,
particularly with respect to Arctic haze and changes in ozone and albedo; (2) to
improve the ability to estimate UV throughout the Arctic, including the effects
of ozone and Arctic haze on UV transmission in the Arctic; and (3) to make the
UV data available to the scientific community.</font></p>
