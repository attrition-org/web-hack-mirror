        <p>The atmosphere experienced a period of relatively low
        CO2 growth during 1992-1993, despite continuing emissions
        of CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels. &nbsp; This was
        followed by two years of above average growth. &nbsp; The
        most likely explanation is that the rate of respiration
        of plants and soils was somewhat lower than normal on the
        continents, which were cooler in the aftermath of the
        Pinatubo eruption due to resulting stratospheric aerosol.
        This diminished respiration allowed the buildup of
        slightly more young and fairly labile organic material,
        which decayed in the following years. &nbsp; This
        interpretation is strengthened by the time history of the
        13C/12C isotopic ratio of CO2. &nbsp; The manufacture of
        organic material during photosynthesis is accompanied by
        isotopic fractionation. &nbsp; Photosynthate contains
        slightly less 13C than expected from the atmospheric
        composition. &nbsp; This leaves the CO2 remaining in the
        atmosphere slightly enriched in 13C. </p>
        <p>The atmospheric 13C/12C ratio is expected to decrease
        every year because of the continuing addition of fossil
        fuel carbon depleted in 13C. &nbsp; In 1992-1993 the
        atmospheric 13C/12C did not decrease, and during
        1994-1995 the 13C/12C decrease was more rapid than usual.
        &nbsp; Therefore, the CO2 and 13C/12C data are consistent
        with the net removal of a large amount of CO2 into
        organic material in 1992-1993, which was largely
        delivered back to the atmosphere in the following two
        years. &nbsp; The atmospheric CO2 growth rate during
        1996-1997 was close to the average experienced during the
        decade of the 1980s. </p>
        <p>The figure shows the rate of global CO2 production
        from fossil fuels, and the rate of CO2 uptake by the
        oceans and the terrestrial biosphere combined. &nbsp; The
        difference between the two curves equals the rate of
        atmospheric increase. &nbsp; The dashed curve is a 5-year
        moving average.</p>

        ozone from 16 CMDL Dobson stations. (S. Oltmans)</b> </font><p>Results
        of the analysis of total column ozone data from the
        NOAA/CMDL Cooperative Dobson Observing Network were
        published in <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i> (Komhyr
        et al.,1997) Total column ozone at five U.S. mainland
        stations for the period 1979-1996 showed a significant
        decline of 3.3%/decade with the largest decreases of
        nearly 5%/decade taking place during spring months.
        &nbsp; At the tropical northern hemisphere site at Mauna
        Loa, a small, statistically insignificant ozone increase
        was noted while in the southern hemisphere a small but
        significant annual decline was detected. &nbsp; In
        Antarctica, ozone column amounts have declined in all
        seasons but losses of nearly 20%/decade in the October 15
        &#150; November 30 portion of the year, when the
        Antarctic ozone hole forms, led to the annual decline of
        12%/decade. </p>
        <p>The ground-based Dobson network provides a unique
        perspective on column ozone behavior prior to 1979 and
        the advent of regular satellite observations.&nbsp; Based
        on observations back to 1963 at several continental U.S.
        sites, ozone at the end of 1996 was 6.7% lower than in
        the mid-1960s. &nbsp; At South Pole for the month of
        October, which has had the most dramatic ozone loss,
        column ozone during the 1990s was about one-half of what
        it was in the 1960s. </p>
        <p>Updated data through 1997 from the NOAA/CMDL
        Cooperative Dobson Network played a key role in the 1998
        Ozone Assessment where the surface based observations
        were crucial in determining the global ozone trends.
        &nbsp; The NOAA/CMDL 16 station network represents about
        20% of the global surface based measurement sites. </p>

        <p>Methyl bromide (CH<sub>3</sub>Br) is of interest
        because of its involvement in the depletion of
        stratospheric ozone. &nbsp; Unlike the
        chlorofluorocarbons, which are entirely anthropogenic, CH<sub>3</sub>Br
        has both natural and anthropogenic sources. &nbsp; At
        approximately 10 parts per trillion in the troposphere,
        CH<sub>3</sub>Br is the single largest contributor of
        stratospheric bromine, which is about 50 times more
        effective in depleting stratospheric ozone than chlorine.
        Sinks for atmospheric CH<sub>3</sub>Br, once thought to
        include only photochemical, atmospheric reactions, now
        include photolysis, reaction with OH, uptake by the
        oceans, and loss to soils. &nbsp; One focus of study at
        CMDL in recent years has been the removal of atmospheric
        CH<sub>3</sub>Br by the oceans. &nbsp; Initial two-box
        model calculations showed that, owing to aquatic chemical
        degradation, the ocean was a significant sink for
        atmospheric CH<sub>3</sub>Br, regardless of its degree of
        saturation in seawater [Butler, J.H.<i> Geophysical
        Research Letters</i> <i>21</i>, 185-188, 1994]. &nbsp; A
        global, ocean-atmosphere model later was developed to
        study the uptake of CH<sub>3</sub>Br by the oceans.
        &nbsp; Use of this model lowered the estimated lifetime
        of atmospheric CH<sub>3</sub>Br and significantly reduced
        the uncertainties in its partial atmospheric lifetime
        with respect to oceanic uptake [Yvon and Butler, <i>Geophysical
        Research Letters, 23</i>, 53-56, 1996]. &nbsp; Results
        also demonstrated that the distribution of oceanic
        degradation is important in calculating the partial
        atmospheric lifetime of a trace gas with respect to
        oceanic loss and, consequently, its total atmospheric
        lifetime (Red represents fast and blue represents slow in
        the above figure). &nbsp; Prompted by NOAA/CMDL findings
        in the Southern Ocean [Lobert, J.M. <i>et al.</i>,<i>
        Geophysical Research. Letter,. 24</i>, 171-172 1997], as
        well as findings by others working in different parts of
        the ocean, that biological processes also contribute to
        the overall removal of CH<sub>3</sub>Br in seawater, we
        built a biological term into the model to determine the
        additional effect of oceanic biological degradation on
        the lifetime of atmospheric CH<sub>3</sub>Br [Yvon-Lewis
        and Butler, <i>Geophysical Research Letters, 24</i>,
        1227-1230, 1997]. &nbsp; The atmospheric lifetime, once
        put at around 2 years, now stands at 0.7 (range of 0.5 to
        1.2) years, with about 40% of the loss going to the
        ocean. &nbsp; Because the atmospheric lifetime of a
        compound is proportional to its ozone depletion potential
        (ODP), the lower atmospheric lifetime represents a lower,
        calculated ODP. &nbsp; The value determined here is that
        used in the 1998 WMO/UNEP Scientific Assessment of Ozone
        Depletion. </p>

        <p>An important paper [Wamsley <i>et al</i>., <i>Journal
        of Geophysical Research</i>, <i>103</i>, 1513-1526, 1998]
        was recently published that used ground-based trends and
        stratospheric observations of brominated compounds to
        describe the bromine loading of the stratosphere. &nbsp;
        Many of the stratospheric observations were made from the
        Airborne Chromatograph for Atmospheric Trace Species
        instrument (ACATS-IV) operated on the NASA ER-2
        high-altitude aircraft. &nbsp; The instrument is the
        result of a collaborative effort between NOAA's Climate
        Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) and Aeronomy
        Laboratory (AL). &nbsp; Bromine abundances are plotted in
        the figure as a function of stratospheric mixing ratios
        of chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11, CCl<sub>3</sub>F, used
        here as a proxy for altitude) and the mean age of sampled
        air parcels. &nbsp; Stratospheric mean age is determined
        from ACATS-IV observations of sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>)
        and the SF<sub>6</sub> trend obtained from the
        ground-based CMDL network. &nbsp; Total bromine (Br<sub>TOT</sub>,
        blue) in panel <i>(a)</i> is defined as the sum of
        bromine of all organic species that are present in the
        upper tropospheric air parcel at the time of entry into
        the tropical stratosphere. &nbsp; The increase in Br<sub>TOT</sub>
        with mean age demonstrates that bromine is still
        increasing throughout the atmosphere. &nbsp; Although
        production of the halons and CFCs in 1996 has ceased in
        developed countries under the auspices of the Montreal
        Protocol, atmospheric bromine loading continues to
        increase because of the release of stored halons in
        developed countries and the use of halons in developing
        countries. &nbsp; Total organic bromine (CBr<sub>y</sub>,
        red) in the stratosphere is estimated from the ACATS-IV
        measurements of a major halon, H-1211 (CBrClF<sub>2</sub>),
        and modeled correlations of the unmeasured organic
        bromine species with CFC-11. &nbsp; The inorganic bromine
        (Br<sub>y</sub>) reservoir, containing the species BrO,
        BrONO<sub>2</sub>, Br, and HOBr, is produced by the
        destruction of CBr<sub>y</sub> species in the
        stratosphere. &nbsp; The abundance of Br<sub>y</sub>
        (green) shown in panel <i>(b)</i> estimated as the
        difference of Br<sub>TOT </sub>(blue) and CBr<sub>y</sub>
        (red), increases with mean stratospheric age. &nbsp; Many
        of the Br<sub>y</sub> species, along with reactive
        chlorine species, participate in the catalytic
        destruction of ozone throughout the stratosphere. &nbsp;
        Independent estimates for Br<sub>y</sub> (gold diamonds)
        based on observations of BrO made by scientists from
        Harvard University and model results for the remaining
        inorganic species in panel <i>(b)</i> show on average
        higher levels of Br<sub>y</sub> in the stratosphere.
        &nbsp; This discrepancy could be the result of larger
        uncertainties in the Harvard results (about ±50%), or an
        additional organic or inorganic compound entering the
        stratosphere from the troposphere. &nbsp; Thus, in
        contrast to the organic and inorganic budgets of chlorine
        which are in balance and slowly decreasing, the bromine
        budgets are still increasing in the atmosphere and may be
        out of balance. &nbsp; Understanding the bromine budget
        is essential because bromine is about 50 times more
        effective than chlorine in destroying stratospheric
        ozone. &nbsp; The results of this study are included in
        the recent 1998 World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
        United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) Scientific
        Assessment of Ozone Depletion. </p>

        Ozone at CMDL Monitoring Stations. (S. Oltmans)</b> </font><p>In
        a recent paper published in <i>Geophysical Research
        Letters</i> (Oltmans et al., 1998) we used a
        geographically disbursed set of surface ozone and ozone
        vertical profile measurements to document long-term ozone
        changes in the troposphere. &nbsp; In mid-latitudes of
        the northern hemisphere, where the influence of
        human-produced ozone precursor gasses is likely to have
        had the largest impact, there are significant regional
        differences. &nbsp; Over Europe ozone has increased
        dramatically throughout the troposphere (~15%/decade)
        over the past 25 years. &nbsp; In Japan an increase of
        nearly 10%/decade has occurred over this period, but this
        has taken place primarily in the lowest part of the
        troposphere. &nbsp; Over North America, on the other
        hand, the changes are small. This variation is somewhat
        surprising since it is expected that in all of these
        regions precursor emissions rose during the past 25
        years. &nbsp; Most of the increase in Europe and Japan
        took place prior to the mid-1980s, with much smaller
        increases since then. </p>
        <p>Although there are fewer data in other regions,
        several characteristics emerge. &nbsp; In tropical
        regions changes are generally small but at Mauna Loa,
        Hawaii there has been an increase of 3.5%/decade, but
        again with most of the change occurring before the early
        1980s. &nbsp; At mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere
        the records beginning in the early 1980s suggest a small
        but significant increase which is found primarily during
        the time of year when biomass burning in southern Africa
        and South America is most pronounced (July - October).
        &nbsp; The polar regions are unique in showing
        significant declines in tropospheric ozone amounts.
        &nbsp; Ozonesonde data from Canadian sites and the
        surface ozone record at South Pole show downward trends
        of about 7%/decade. &nbsp; The decline at sites in the
        polar regions appears to be linked to the significant
        decrease that has occurred in the lower stratosphere of
        these regions. </p>
