<p><big><font face="Arial"><b>Provide an initial estimate as to when the beginning of the
recovery of the Antarctic ozone layer could be first detected. (CMDL, D. Hofmann)</b></font></big></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Depletion of the Earth&#146;s stratospheric ozone
layer is considered a major environmental problem as it enables the increase of
ultraviolet radiation harmful to humans and other biological systems. The global annual
average total column ozone has decreased by an average of about 6% during the past 15
years, while springtime Antarctic ozone (the &quot;ozone hole&quot;) is now reduced to one
third the value it had prior to the 1970's during the months of September and October. In
response to this situation, the Montreal Protocol of 1987 and subsequent amendments
regulated the production of the long-lived chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other chlorine-
and bromine-containing compounds (such as halons). NOAA/CMDL measurements indicated that
the total effective ozone-destroying chlorine in all these compounds reached a maximum and
began a slow decrease at the surface in 1994. This scenario is expected to be repeated in
the stratosphere in the next one or two years. All else being equal, the recovery of the
ozone layer can then begin. The observation of the beginning of the recovery of the
Antarctic ozone hole was estimated to occur as early as 2010.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><img src="fy98_41.jpg" alt="wpe2.jpg (15320 bytes)" align="right" WIDTH="362" HEIGHT="229">New information has changed these estimates. The final draft of the 1998
WMO/UNEP Scientific Assessment of the Ozone Layer was submitted in August 1998. Following
review by the parties to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer,
the assessment will be released to the public, in early 1999. The Executive Summary
appeared in July 1998. Chapter 12 of the full document is entitled &quot;Predicting Future
Ozone Changes and Detection of Recovery&quot; (D. Hofmann and J. Pyle, Lead Co-Authors).
Because of the increase in greenhouse gases during the next 50 years, a conclusion of the
Assessment is that the atmosphere will not return to it&#146;s pre-1970 state but to a new
climatic and chemical state which will affect ozone levels. Unfortunately, the climatic
effects (a colder stratosphere) and the chemical effects (increased nitrous oxide and a
slowdown in the growth rate of methane) all exacerbate ozone depletion and will cause a
delay in the beginning of recovery. While total effective stratospheric chlorine will
remain high for the next 10-20 years, when it begins to decline, ozone will not follow
lock-step because of these atmospheric changes. It is now estimated that the unambiguous
detection of the beginning of the closing of the Antarctic ozone hole will not occur
before about 2030. The figure shows total column ozone as measured at the US station at
the South Pole and the UK station at Halley. The smooth curves are a typical
two-dimensional dynamical-chemical model prediction of the expected recovery, normalized
to 1980 initial conditions, with uncertainty limits. The low values in the early
1990&#146;s were associated with the additional aerosol particles from the Pinatubo
eruption which augmented the chlorine-catalyzed chemistry of the normal polar
stratospheric cloud particles. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Full recovery of global ozone is estimated to occur
in the decade after 2050 assuming that the future phaseouts of compounds such as methyl
bromide, halons and the CFC replacements take place as projected.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><big><font face="Arial">Test automatic air sampling system for use on
military and commercial aircraft. (CMDL, D. Guenther, P. Tans)</font></big></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The objective of monitoring atmospheric greenhouse
gas concentrations is not only to track their rates of increase but also to deduce, from
the atmospheric concentration patterns, large-scale changes in their sources and sinks at
the surface of the earth. This information will be important in defining policies aimed at
lowering the human contribution to the greenhouse effect and climate change. The largest
gap in the greenhouse gas global monitoring system is the lack of regular measurements of
the vertical profile of such gases over continental areas. In order to make such
measurements economically possible we have developed an automated system for obtaining air
samples from aircraft platforms. The system consists of two suitcases, one with batteries
and compressors, and one with 20 sampling flasks, a gas manifold, dryer, and
controller/datalogger (see photo in figure). The aircraft needs only to provide a clean
air intake for outside air. In the laboratory we analyze the air samples for CO<sub>2</sub>,
CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, CO, H<sub>2</sub>, SF<sub>6</sub>, and the isotopic ratios
of CO<sub>2</sub>, also in automated fashion.</font></p>

privately owned aircraft, but is now undergoing further engineering development to make it
rugged and fail-safe enough for extensive use aboard commercial and military aircraft.
Some results on the vertical distribution of CO<sub>2</sub> from the surface to an
altitude of 8 km, from a recent test flight over Carr, Colorado, are shown in the right of
the figure. The enhanced database, including the vertical profiles, will be used in
inverse models developed by researchers in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Asia. These
models are used to &quot;translate&quot; the observed concentrations into estimates of the
greenhouse gas sources and sinks that produce the observations. The new observations will
play a critical role in verifying and refining a recent result, published in <i>Science</i>,
Vol. 282, 16 October 1998, that the vegetation and soils of the North American continent
are currently an enormous sink of carbon dioxide.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><big><font face="Arial">Complete a balloon-borne observation of
ozone-related gases in the POLARIS and OMS-Brazil missions. (CMDL, J. Elkins, S. Oltmans).
</font></big></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The purpose of the POLARIS (Photochemistry of Ozone
Loss in Arctic Regions in Summer) mission conducted from Fairbanks, Alaska was to study
the natural loss of stratospheric ozone that occurs in the Arctic during summertime. The
purpose of the OMS (Observations of the Middle Stratosphere) mission in Brazil and New
Mexico was to study transport in the tropical and midlatitude stratosphere and thus aid
the study of ozone depletion. The two missions involving over six scientific balloon
flights were completed in May 1998. Two instruments from NOAA's Climate Monitoring and
Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) were involved. The Lightweight Airborne Chromatograph
Experiment (LACE) measures chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-113, and
halon-1211 and SF<sub>6</sub> once every 70 seconds to altitudes as high as 32 km. LACE is
mounted on a NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) gondola (400 kg) containing five other
instruments measuring O<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and
meteorological parameters. CMDL scientists also launched a separate free-flying balloon at
about the same time to record water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O) with a cooled mirror
frost-point hygrometer.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><img src="ozone1.jpg" alt="ozone1.jpg (29770 bytes)" align="right" width="392" height="358">One of the major discoveries of the POLARIS mission
was the observation of very low values for many trace gases at 20-25 km. Typically,
vertical profiles of CFC-12 (CCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>) are identical for midlatitude
and polar regions (green and blue curves in the figure, panel a). However, there was a
major ozone depletion event formed in a strong and stable vortex over the Arctic in late
March 1997. The remnants of that event were still visible in the mixing ratios of many
trace gases by late June. It is believed that these trace gases had descended earlier from
higher altitudes (blue arrow in panel a). Chemical tracer models were able to point to
this event as the most probable cause of the low values in late June. The vertical
profiles of CFC-12 in the tropics (red curves in panel a) are not identical to those of
the midlatitudes because of the large average upward air flow resulting in higher mixing
ratios in the upper tropical stratosphere. The water vapor measurements (panel b) show the
seasonal variation of transport of water vapor into the lower tropical stratosphere. The
upward movement of the water vapor maximum (A -&gt; A<b>&#146;</b>) and minimum (B -&gt; B<b>&#146;</b>)
into the stratosphere (red arrows), from February to November, allows one to obtain the
mean vertical advection ascent rate of air in the tropics. These results are used by
modelers that estimate the effects of emissions from aircraft and pollutants on
stratospheric ozone depletion. Different transport rates can significantly change the
results of the models and affect estimated ozone predictions. The observations reported
here will be part of an upcoming NASA Assessment of the Effects of Aviation on the
Atmosphere. Three papers are in preparation for journal publication. The next step is to
examine transport during the formation of the polar vortex in wintertime during the
SAGE-III Ozone Loss Validation Experiment (SOLVE) in 1999-2000.<font SIZE="1"> </font></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><big><font face="Arial">Report on the test predictions of radiative
forcing by aerosols by evaluating theory and observations at a well-measured site. (CMDL,
J. Ogren) </font></big></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Calculations of aerosol radiative forcing rely on
many assumptions about aerosol properties. A key &quot;checkpoint&quot; in these
calculations is the aerosol optical depth (AOD), which is a measure of the attenuation of
the direct solar beam by particles in the atmosphere. The objective of this milestone was
to determine how well direct measurements of aerosol optical depth, which are sensitive to
aerosols throughout the entire vertical column, agree with values calculated from
independent, surface-based measurements of aerosol radiative properties. The extent of
agreement between the two values can be interpreted as a measure of the applicability of
surface-based measurements, such as are obtained at NOAA's baseline observatories and
regional aerosol monitoring stations, for testing model predictions of aerosol radiative
forcing.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img src="rad1.jpg" alt="rad1.jpg (15995 bytes)" align="right" WIDTH="455" HEIGHT="355"><font face="Arial">One year of measurements from a highly-instrumented site in Oklahoma,
operated by the U.S. Department of Energy's &quot;ARM&quot; program (Atmospheric Radiation
Measurements), were evaluated. A new and unique aspect of the analysis was the integration
of in-situ measurements near the surface with a remote-sensing technique (LIDAR) for
determining the vertical profile of aerosols, in order to estimate aerosol properties that
neither approach can determine alone. The results (summarized in the figure) show that if
four key pieces of information are available, the aerosol optical depth can be calculated
from surface measurements to within about 20%. Three of these are routinely being measured
at the ARM site: aerosol light scattering and absorption coefficients near the surface,
and the vertical profile of aerosol backscattering. The missing piece, which must be
included if good agreement is to be obtained, describes the dependence of aerosol light
scattering on relative humidity. The implication of this result is that aerosol
hygroscopic growth must be measured in order to relate surface-based measurements to the
column optical depth, and the ARM program has subsequently funded NOAA/CMDL to implement
this measurement at their site in Oklahoma. A report of the results from this study was
submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research in August, 1998, and preliminary results
were presented at the 1997 ARM Science Team meeting.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><big><font face="Arial">Improve the instrumentation of two North
American &quot;baseline&quot; observation stations for the physical and chemical
characteristics of aerosols (CMDL, J. Ogren)</font></big></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">NOAA/CMDL operates one baseline observatory in North
America, located at Point Barrow, Alaska. The aerosol sampling system at this station was
upgraded in October, 1997, in order to enhance the utility of the data for calculation of
aerosol radiative forcing. The original instrumentation for determining aerosol light
scattering (integrating nephelometer) and light absorption coefficients (Aethalometer) was
left in place, and newer instruments offering higher sensitivity, additional measurement
parameters, and more reliable calibration were installed. A new sample inlet system, which
allows control of sample relative humidity and the ability to sample two different size
ranges of particles, was also installed. The upgrade brings the Barrow observatory, which
has been measuring aerosols since 1976, up to the standard of CMDL's regional aerosol
monitoring network, which started in 1992. The next step, planned for 1999, will be a
similar upgrade of the aerosol sampling system at the Mauna Loa observatory.</font></p>

    model-based predictions of radiative fluxes at the surface with direct measurements. Data
    from the new system are quality-checked within one working day of collection, and made
    available to the ARM program (as well as the general public) on CMDL's web site. A
    preliminary evaluation of the results from the two systems (shown in the figure)

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><big><font face="Arial"><strong>Upgrade UV Measuring Instruments at
Barrow Observatory. (CMDL, B. Bodhaine, R. Tatusko)</strong></font></big></p>
<font SIZE="3">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">During the spring of 1997, stratospheric ozone in
the Arctic reached all time lows with losses due to halogen-related chemistry rivaling the
Antarctic losses observed when the infamous &quot;ozone hole&quot; was uncovered in 1985.
Three-dimensional, coupled physical-chemical models indicate that depletion of
stratospheric ozone in the Arctic will increase in the future as climate change cools the
stratosphere and stabilizes the polar vortex during the period when stratospheric chlorine
and bromine from human-made halogen compounds will remain high (the next 20-30 years).
Increases in ultraviolet (UV) radiation related to reduced ozone levels is a serious
problem for the inhabitants of these regions as well as for the various ecosystems.
However, measurements are seriously lacking with no dedicated monitoring network in place.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img src="brw1.jpg" alt="brw1.jpg (8419 bytes)" align="right" WIDTH="404" HEIGHT="265"><font face="Arial">In response to a need for improved UV measurements in the Arctic, NOAA/CMDL,
with support from NOAA&#146;s Arctic Research Initiative (ARI), deployed two UV radiation
instruments at the CMDL Barrow Observatory in September 1997. One was a broadband UV
radiometer, which measures total irradiance over the 280-320 nm spectrum and produces an
output proportional to biologically important UV radiation (UVB) or &quot;erythemal
dose,&quot; which describes the response of human skin to solar radiation. The other
instrument was a narrow-band (10 nm) radiometer, which measures UV irradiance at five
wavelengths (305 nm, 313 nm, 320 nm, 340 nm, and 380 nm) and is useful for applications
that require better resolution than offered by broadband instruments. Because of their
ease in maintenance and lower cost, compared to a high-resolution spectroradiometer, these
instruments are ideal for deployment in the harsh Arctic environment. The figure shows the
instruments mounted in the radiation rack at Barrow Observatory. The Dobson ozone
spectrophotometer dome is in the lower background. This instrument will be used for ozone
measurements for UV correlation studies.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The UV data will be available at the CMDL web site
and will serve a number of users: </font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">NOAA will use it to investigate the relation between changes in ozone
    and changes in UV.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The University of Alaska at Fairbanks, which has developed a
    radiative transfer model for this region, will use it to determine column ozone amounts
    (for comparison with the Dobson spectrophotometer), UV doses, and for construction of
    biological action spectra.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">NASA will use it to develop reliable algorithms to determine surface
    UV exposure in the Arctic from satellite data.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The biological community will use it to study potential effects of
    increasing UV on Arctic ecosystems.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Finally, the public will be able to access the data for their
    information.</font></li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">This activity could also contribute to the next
phase of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP), which has placed a
high-priority on climate change and UVB. The results of this activity will be reported in
articles submitted to peer-reviewed journals and in presentations at appropriate
scientific conferences. Discussions are also taking place with members of the Alaskan
native communities to inform them of this effort and solicit their advice and local
expertise. The next step will be to deploy two additional multi-wavelength instruments at
sites in and near the Bering Sea.</font></font></p>
