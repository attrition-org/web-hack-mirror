Cover: Contour plots showing the temporal and spatial variations
in the atmospheric increases of carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>, upper panel)
and methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>, lower panel). The cooler colors (blue, violet,
black) represent periods of lower than average growth rates and
the warmer colors (yellow, orange, red) represent high growth
rate periods. These plots are derived from measurements of thousands
of samples collected at the CMDL Cooperative Air Sampling Network
sites. The variations in the growth rates of these climatically
important gases are due to interannual variations in the imbalances
between sources and sinks, and also to variations in atmospheric
transport. Because the major sources and sinks for CO<SUB>2</SUB> and CH<SUB>4</SUB>
are different, their patterns of growth rate variations are usually
dissimilar. An exception to this is the period of low, and even
negative growth rates of both gases in 1992-1993, a period when
anomalous low temperatures were observed. These observations provide
powerful constraints on attempts to model the global carbon cycle.

The Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) is located
in Boulder, Colorado, with observatories in Barrow, Alaska; Mauna
Loa, Hawaii; Cape Matatula, American Samoa; and South Pole, Antarctica.
It is one of twelve components of the Environmental Research Laboratories
(ERL) within the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR)
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
CMDL conducts research related to atmospheric constituents that
are capable of forcing change in the climate of the earth through
modification of the atmospheric radiative environment, for example
greenhouse gases and aerosols, and those that may cause depletion
of the global ozone layer.
<P>
This report is a summary of activities of CMDL for calendar years
1994 and 1995. It is the 23rd consecutive report issued by this
organization and its Air Resources Laboratory/Geophysical Monitoring
for Climatic Change predecessor since formation in 1972. From
1972 through 1993 (numbers 1 through 22), reports were issued
annually. However, with this issue we begin a 2-year reporting
cycle, which stems from a need to most efficiently use the time
and financial resources of our staff and laboratory and from a
general trend towards electronic media. In this respect, CMDL
has developed a comprehensive internet home page during the past
2 years. There you will find information about our major groups
and observatories, latest events and press releases, publications,
data availability, and personnel. Numerous data graphs and ftp
data files are available. The URL address is http://www.cmdl.noaa.gov.
Information (program descriptions, accomplishments, publications,
plans, data access, etc.) on CMDL parent organizations can best
be obtained via the internet. Their URL addresses are ERL: http://www.erl.noaa.gov;
OAR: http://www.oar.noaa.gov; NOAA: http://www.noaa.gov.
<P>
In 1995, Eldon Ferguson retired from federal service and from
the CMDL Director's position that he held from the formation of
the Laboratory in 1990. On a personal note, we extend to him our
best wishes for the future and our thanks for scientific guidance
and direction in the past. In 1996, David Hofmann, the CMDL Chief
Scientist since 1990, was appointed Director of CMDL.
