<p><font face="Arial">Abstract: The burden of ozone-depleting chemicals in the lower
atmosphere has been decreasing since 1994 as a result of the Montreal Protocol. Here, we
show how individual chemicals have influenced this decline, in order to estimate how the
burden could change in the near future. Our measurements of atmospheric concentrations of
the persistent, anthropogenic chemicals that account for most ozone-depleting halogen in
today&#146;s stratosphere show decline stems predominantly from the decrease in the
atmospheric load of trichloroethane (CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub>), a previously common
cleaning solvent. The influence of this chemical has now peaked, however, and will become
much smaller over the next five to ten years. As this influence lessens, a decrease in the
burden of ozone-depleting halogen will be sustained only if emissions of other halocarbons
fall. Although emissions of most gases regulated by the Montreal Protocol have decreased
substantially over the past ten years, emissions of the potent ozone-depleting gas CBrClF<sub>2</sub>
(halon-1211) have remained fairly constant during this period, despite stringent limits on
production in developed countries since 1994. The consequent atmospheric accumulation of
this halon is retarding the decline of ozone-depleting halogen in the atmosphere more than
any other persistent gas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Abstract: The Lightweight Airborne Chromatograph Experiment (LACE)
has made in situ measurements of several long-lived trace gases in the upper troposphere
and lower to middle stratosphere as part of the Observations of the Middle Stratosphere
(OMS) balloon program. The tracers measured by LACE include several photolytic species
(CFC-11, CFC-12 and halon-1211) as well as SF<sub>6</sub>. LACE measurements of these
long-lived tracers as well as nearly simultaneous measurements of water vapor and CO<sub>2</sub>
are used to investigate transport into the lowermost stratosphere, a region where few in
situ measurements exist. The measured photolytic species and water vapor are used in a
simple mass balance calculation to estimate the mixture of tropospheric and overworld (q
&gt; 380 K) air in the lowermost stratosphere. In the northern midlatitudes during
September 1996 most of the air in the lowermost stratosphere sampled at the flight
location (34.5&#131;N) was transported quasi-isentropically from the troposphere.
Measurements from both a May 1998 midlatitude flight and a June 1997 high latitude flight
(64.5&#131;N) revealed the air sampled in the lowermost stratosphere to be dominated by
downward advection from the overworld. Atmospheric SF<sub>6</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> can
uniquely reveal time and spatial scales of transport due to these species' large growth
rates and subsequent latitudinal surface and free tropospheric gradients. Measurements in
the lowermost stratosphere from the September northern midlatitude flight coupled with
surface measurements of these species revealed a transport time scale of no more than 1.5
months from the surface to the lowermost stratosphere. The SF<sub>6</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>
mixing ratios were also consistent with mostly Northern Hemisphere tropospheric air in the
lowermost stratosphere. These results point out the usefulness of high resolution in situ
measurements of long-lived tracers to help determine time and spatial scales of transport
in the region of the upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere.</font></font></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Abstract:</b> Methane (CH4), molecular hydrogen (H2), and
water vapor (H2O) were measured concurrently on board the NASA ER-2 aircraft during the
1995-1996 Stratospheric Tracers of Atmospheric Transport (STRAT) and 1997 Photochemistry
of Ozone Loss in the Arctic Region in Summer (POLARIS) campaigns. Correlations between
these three main hydrogen reservoirs in the northern extratropical lower stratosphere are
examined to evaluate H2O production from CH<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> oxidation. The
expected ratio of stratospheric H2O production (PH2O) to CH4 destruction (LCH4) = 1.973 ±
0.003 is calculated from an evaluation of CH<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> oxidation
reactions and the relationship between H2 and CH<sub>4</sub> mixing ratios measured during
STRAT. Correlations between H2O and CH4 were tight and linear only for air masses with
mean ages ³ 3.8 years, restricting this analysis predominantly to latitudes between 40°
and 90°N and potential temperatures between 470 and 540 K. The mean observed DH2O/DCH4
(-2.15 ± 0.18) is in statistical agreement with the expected PH2O/LCH4. The annual mean
stratospheric entry mixing ratio for H2O calculated from this slope is 4.0 ± 0.3 ppm. The
quantity H2O + 2·CH4 is quasi-conserved at 7.4 ± 0.5 ppm in older air masses in the
northern extratropical lower strato-sphere. Significant departure of H2O + 2·CH4 from the
mean value is a sensitive indicator of processes which influence H2O without affecting
CH4, such as dehydration in a polar vortex or near the tropical tropopause. No significant
trend is observed in ER-2 aircraft data for H2O + 2·CH4 in the lower stratosphere from
1993 through 1997</font></small>.</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>Abstract.</b> In an effort to better constrain atmospheric
water vapor mixing ratios and to understand the discrepancies between measurements of
water vapor in the stratosphere and troposphere, we have carefully examined data from the
Harvard Lyman-a photofragment fluorescence hygrometer, which flew on the NASA ER-2
aircraft from 1992 to 1997 during the SPADE, CEPEX, STRAT, and POLARIS missions. The
instrument is calibrated in the laboratory before and after each deployment, and the
calibration is checked by direct absorption measurements in the troposphere and lowermost
stratosphere. On certain flights, the ER-2 flew level tracks in which water vapor varied
by up to 80 ppmv, under nearly constant atmospheric conditions. These flights provide a
stringent test of our calibration via direct absorption, and indicate agreement to within
3%. During the 1997 POLARIS mission, our Lyman-a instrument was compared with a new diode
laser hygrometer from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Overall agreement was 5% during the
June/July deployment, and 1% for potential temperatures of 490 to 540K. The accuracy of
our instrument is shown to be ±5%, with an additional offset of at most 0.1 ppmv. Data
from this instrument, combined with simultaneous measurements of CH4 and H2, are therefore
ideal for studies of the hydrogen budget of the lower stratosphere</small><font size="1">.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Abstract: The atmospheric burden of halons has continued to increase
in recent years, despite an international ban on their production and sales in developed
nations as of 1 January 1994. Halon emissions persist because of a lack of suitable
substitutes for critical uses as fire extinguishants. As of 1 January 1997, halons H-1301
(CBrF<sub>3</sub>), H-1211 (CBrClF<sub>2</sub>), and H-2402 (CBr<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>)
were present in the troposphere at 2.3±0.1, 3.5±0.1, and 0.45±0.03 pmol mol<sup>-1</sup>.
During 1995-96, the tropospheric mole fraction of H-1301 increased at 0.044±0.011 pmol
mol<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>, while that for H-1211 grew at 0.16±0.016 pmol mol<sup>-1</sup>
y<sup>-1</sup>. These increases are significant and of concern because of the efficiency
of bromine in depleting stratospheric ozone and because of the long atmospheric lifetimes
of these gases. Given the current atmospheric record and the reported amount of halon
produced before the ban on their production, emission of H-1301 at the 1995-96 rate could
continue for another 40 years, but H-1211 would be depleted in 8-12 years. Exemptions to
the ban on production may extend these periods. Tropospheric H-2402 is increasing at 9±1
fmol mol<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>, but historical data on its production and use are
lacking.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Abstract: Recent trends in the atmospheric variability of seven
halogenated trace gases are determined from three years (November 1994 through October
1997) of hourly gas chromatographic measurements at a 610 m tower in North Carolina and 17
months (June 1996 through October 1997) of similar measurements at a 450 m tower in
Wisconsin. Production of five of these gases, CCl<sub>3</sub>F (CFC-11), CCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>
(CFC-12), CCl<sub>2</sub>FCClF<sub>2</sub> (CFC-113), CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub>
(methyl chloroform), and CCl<sub>4</sub> (carbon tetrachloride), is now strictly regulated
in the United States and other developed countries under international legislation. C<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>
(tetrachloroethene) and SF<sub>6</sub> (sulfur hexafluoride) are currently produced
without restriction, but requests for voluntary cutbacks in C<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>
emissions have been made, at least in the United States. Atmospheric variability of these
gases is examined at several sampling heights on the towers, but trends are deduced using
only nighttime data at the top sampling level of each tower to minimize variability driven
by local emissions and the diurnal cycle of the planetary boundary layer, leaving regional
emissions as the main source of day-to-day variability. Significant downward trends are
determined for CFC-12, CFC-113, CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub>, and C<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>
variability at both towers, reflecting decreased emissions of these gases in two regions
of the United States. Trends in CFC-11, CCl<sub>4</sub>, and SF<sub>6</sub> variability at
both towers are not significantly different from zero.</font></p>

real-time measurements of H-1211 (CBrClF<sub>2</sub>) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>)
mixing ratios in the stratosphere up to 20 km. Stratospheric air was analyzed for these
gases and others with a new gas chromatograph, flown aboard a National Aeronautics and
Space Administration ER-2 aircraft as part of the Airborne Southern Hemisphere Ozone
Experiment/Measurements for Assessing the Effects of Stratospheric Aircraft mission
conducted in 1994. The mixing ratio of SF<sub>6</sub>, with its nearly linear increase in
the troposphere, was used to estimate the mean age of stratospheric air parcels along the
ER-2 flight path. Measurements of H-1211 and mean age estimates were then combined with
simultaneous measurements of CFC-11 (CCl<sub>3</sub>F), measurements of brominated
compounds in stratospheric whole air samples, and records of tropospheric organic bromine
mixing ratios to calculate the dry mixing ratio of total bromine in the lower stratosphere
and its partitioning between organic and inorganic forms. We estimate that the organic
bromine-containing species were almost completely photolyzed to inorganic species in the
oldest air parcels sampled. Our results for inorganic bromine are consistent with those
obtained from a photochemical, steady state model for stratospheric air parcels with
CFC-11 mixing ratios greater than 150 ppt. For stratospheric air parcels with CFC-11
mixing ratios less than 50 ppt (mean age greater than or equal to 5 years) we calculate
inorganic bromine mixing ratios that are approximately 20% less than the photochemical,
steady state model. There is a 20% reduction in calculated ozone loss resulting from
bromine chemistry in old air relative to some previous estimates as a result of the lower
bromine levels.</font></p>
