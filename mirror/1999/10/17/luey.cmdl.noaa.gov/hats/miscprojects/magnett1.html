<p>The <i><b>Measurements of Anthropogenic Gases and Natural Emissions from Tall Towers</b></i>
(MAGNETT) program of NOAA/CMDL utilizes existing tall (&gt;400 m) towers as sampling
platforms for in-situ and flask sample analyses of atmospheric trace gases. The program
began in June, 1992, with continuous monitoring of CO<sub>2</sub> and 222Rn mixing ratios,
wind speed and direction, temperature, and relative humidity at three levels up to 500 m
on the <a href="http://netsrv1.cmdl.noaa.gov/hats/stations/itn.html">WITN</a> TV
transmitter tower in eastern North Carolina. Weekly flask sampling at WITN was started in
July, 1992, with filled flasks returned to the Boulder laboratory for the analysis of CH<sub>4</sub>,
CO, H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C and <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O
isotope ratios in CO<sub>2</sub>. </p>

<p>The data from WITN show diurnal cycles in CO<sub>2</sub> mixing ratios at the 50, 120
and 500 m measurement levels, with more pronounced cycles near the ground. The diurnal
cycles are modulated by surface uptake and release of CO<sub>2</sub> by vegetation and
soils, emissions from fossil fuel combustion, and by the diurnal development of the
planetary boundary layer. The contribution of regional fossil fuel combustion sources is
especially evident in winter, when biological fluxes are small. In October, 1994, an
automated 4-channel gas chromatograph (GC) was installed at WITN to measure combustion
products (CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>) and other anthropogenic trace gases (CFCs,
methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, sulfur hexafluoride,
perchloroethylene) concurrently with CO<sub>2</sub>. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://netsrv1.cmdl.noaa.gov/hats/stations/lef.html">WLEF</a> TV
transmitter tower in northern Wisconsin became the second site for the MAGNETT program in
October, 1994. Mixing ratios of CO<sub>2</sub> are continuously monitored at six different
levels up to 400 m, and wind speed, wind direction, temperature and relative humidity are
measured at three levels. A weekly flask sampling program is also active at LEF. In the
near future, an automated 2-channel GC will be installed at this site to measure CO, CH<sub>4</sub>,
H<sub>2</sub>, CFCs, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. </p>

<h4><b>Some goals of the MAGNETT program are:</b></h4>

<p>Monitor CO<sub>2</sub> and other radiatively important trace gases over the continental
interior for comparison with &quot;background&quot; (e.g., marine boundary layer, mountain
top) sites, to deduce continental sources and sinks. </p>

<p>Determine mean mixing ratios of trace gases in the planetary boundary layer, and
diurnal cycles as a function of height. The data will also be useful for testing planetary
boundary layer parameterizations in regional and global circulation models. </p>

<p>Characterize and monitor regional emission signatures of 

<ul>
  <li>- combustion products (CO, H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>) </li>
  <li>- anthropogenic gases (CFCs, SF<sub>6</sub>, chlorocarbons) </li>
  <li>- biogenically produced gases (N<sub>2</sub>O, CH<sub>4</sub>) </li>
</ul>

<p>To simultaneously measure many species (halocarbons, CO) which will help determine the
relative influence of biogenic processes vs. fossil fuel combustion on CO<sub>2</sub>
mixing ratios, and the relative influence of biogenic vs. anthropogenic CH<sub>4</sub>
emissions. </p>

<p>Determine vertical gradients of radiatively important trace gases over the continent to
estimate surface sources/sinks. </p>
