<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>

<p align="left"><img SRC="bull_sit.gif" ALIGN="left" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="83">Mixing ratios of nitrous oxide and <a HREF="http://netsrv1.cmdl.noaa.gov/hats/publictn/elkins/cfcs.html">chlorofluorocarbons</a>
have been increasing in the earth's atmosphere as the result of human activity. These
compounds are in part responsible for the observed decrease in stratospheric ozone around
the globe. The Antarctic ozone hole formed in the austral spring is a manifestation of
this interaction. These gases, in particular nitrous oxide, can also affect the
temperature of the atmosphere and earth's surface in a manner similar to that of carbon
dioxide and methane through the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. Under NOAA's Radiatively
Important Trace Species (RITS) program and Climate and Global Change Program, CMDL is
measuring these gases in the atmosphere using <i>in situ</i> gas chromatographs at all
four CMDL baseline <a HREF="http://netsrv1.cmdl.noaa.gov/hats/stations/stations.html">observatories</a>
and at Niwot Ridge, Colorado in collaboration with the University of Colorado. </p>

<p>At the current time measurements of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), the
chlorofluorocarbons: CFC-12 (CCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>), CFC-11 (CCl<sub>3</sub>F), and
CFC-113 (CCl<sub>2</sub>F-CClF<sub>2</sub>) and the chlorinated solvents: methyl
chloroform (CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub>) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) are
being made once an hour. Surface based mixing ratios of these chemicals are representative
of the troposphere because their atmospheric lifetimes are long and the sites are distant
from sources. The growth rates of all CFCs and chlorinated solvents have diminished in
recent years because of their mandated phase out by the Montreal Protocol and subsequent
amendments. In particular CFC-11, CFC-113, methyl chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride
mixing ratios have peaked in the troposphere and are now diminishing. CFC-12 growth
continues to slow down but has not reached zero yet. This chemical's prior major use in
domestic, commercial, and industrial refrigeration and air conditioning precludes a quick
end to atmospheric release. </p>

<p>With the banned use of chlorofluorocarbons and chlorinated solvents by the end of 1995,
substitute hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have
proliferated. These chemicals are difficult to measure because atmospheric mixing ratios
are extremely low (parts per quadrillion and low parts per trillion) and their electron
capture potential is considerably reduced as the number of halogen atoms is reduced. To
measure the most common of these and other species of interest, a new generation of gas
chromatograph has been developed based on the compact, lightweight, low power usage,
automated systems designed for trace gas analysis aboard aircraft. These
&quot;CATS&quot; (Chromatograph for Atmospheric Trace Species) systems are 4 channel and have the capability of measuring the
previous chemicals of interest as well as sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>), HCFC-22
(CHClF<sub>2</sub>), perchloroethylene (CCl<sub>2</sub>=CCl<sub>2</sub>), 
methyl chloride (CH<sub>3</sub>Cl), and methyl bromide (CH<sub>3</sub>Br). </p>

<p>CATS systems have initially been installed at existing continental tower sites where
sampling lines can be attached to the tower at different heights. Measurements then show
boundary layer effects and vertical gradients since the sites aren't always far removed
from local sources. </p>

<p>Thayne Thompson is the RITS/CATS project leader.  Goeff Dutton is
the CATS project manager acting as the station liaison, managing equipment
deployment and maintenance, and doing the initial
data processing and quality control.  David Nance is the RITS data manager.</p>

<h3>ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE</h3>

<p align="center"><img SRC="gc.gif" ALIGN="center" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="432"> </p>

<p>Air is drawn through a sampling line using a clean pump. This air flushes the gas
sampling valve for about 5 minutes. The flushing is then stopped and the sample bleeds
down to ambient pressure. The sample is inserted into a stream of inert carrier gas
(usually nitrogen or a mixture of argon/methane) which pushes the air through the
separation process. </p>

<p>The separation of the sample air is accomplished using gas chromatography. Tiny porous
beads, sometimes coated with a liquid, interact with the mixture of molecules impeding
there movement either because of their size or their solubility. In our case, this
separation column is divided into two parts. When the chemicals of interest move onto the
second column, the first column's flow is reversed to clean heavier compounds off before
the next injection. This is called &quot;backflushing&quot;. </p>

<p>Detection of the halocompounds is by an electron capture detector. A radioactive foil
of nickel-63 is inside the pin-in-cup detector. The beta decay (an electron) ionizes the
carrier gas forming an electron cloud. Periodically a large positive pulse is applied to
the center electrode. This causes the free electrons to move to the electrode where they
are measured as a tiny current. When a molecule containing halogen atoms, which has the
property of enhanced affinity for electrons, enters the detector, it readily attracts and
holds a free electron. The background current is thus reduced. In due time the electron
capture molecules are flushed out of the detector and the current returns to its previous
level. </p>

<p>The measure of the dip in the current curve is a measure of the amount of chemical
present. By periodically injecting gas mixtures containing known quantities of the
chemical of interest, calibration of the detector is accomplished. </p>

<p>Recording of the inverted current produces a curve called a &quot;chromatogram&quot;. </p>
