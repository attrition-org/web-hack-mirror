    <p><b>Abbreviated Abstract</b><br>
    The amount of methane in Earth's atmosphere has more than doubled since preindustrial
    times. This increase is responsible for about 20% of the estimated change in direct
    radiative forcing due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Recent measurements
    indicate that although methane continues to increase, the rate of increase has slowed.
    Carbon Cycle-Greenhouse Gases analysis of methane measurements made during 1984- 1996
    suggests that methane emissions and global OH have been nearly constant during this time
    period, and the decreasing growth rate of methane reflects an appraoch to steady-state on
    a time scale comparable to methane's lifetime (about 9 years). If global emissions and OH
    remain constant, globally averaged methane will increase from 1730 ppb in 1996 to a
    maximum of about 1800 ppb over the next few decades, with little change in the
    contribution of methane to the greenhouse effect. </p>

    <p><b>Top Panel:</b> Globally averaged atmospheric methane values (solid circles) are
    derived from high-precision measurements of methane in air samples collected weekly at 43
    sites of the <a href="flask.html">NOAA CMDL cooperative air sampling network.</a> A
    mathematical model (dot-dashed line) that accounts for methane emissions and loss in the
    atmosphere accurately estimates the methane lifetime, and it gives a good fit to the
    global averages. Assuming that emissions do not change, methane will slowly increase to a
    maximum value of less than 1800 parts per billion over the next few decades. </p>
    <p><b>Bottom Panel:</b> Total annual methane emissions (circles), calculated from the
    methane global averages (top panel) and a methane lifetime of 8.9 years, are nearly
    constant (except for interannual variations). Methane loss (triangles) by chemical
    reaction depends on the amount of methane in the atmosphere, and thus increases as
    atmospheric methane increases. The difference between emissions and loss is the net annual
    atmospheric methane increase, which is slowly approaching zero. <ul>
