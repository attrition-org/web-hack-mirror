<pre>you may think you know this young man,
but you do not.  his name is mike monson.  back
back in the old days he went by the name of
deadfall.  but after he and some friends were
busted, he narc'd on them.  from then on he
was labeled deadnarc. as you can imagine this
would be a problem if you were trying to
portray the image of a "hacker".  so he changed
his handle to lothos.  then last spring he had
conference called "rootfest".  above are two
photos taken of him at rootfest.</pre>
