<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Hmm.<br>
Looks like this admin forgot to read the rule book, if there is
one? heh<br>
<br>
</strong></font><font size="3">Well, after the first time you
would think the admin would fix the holes...<br>
Not only that, it took 2 days to put the original site back up!<br>
<br>
Maybe this time the admin will fix the problems and KILL all the
services that are not needed &amp; open to exploit!<br>
And next time, don't use the backup index.html, we also altered
that with a little message at the bottom of the page.<br>

Werd, greetz to: frink., hybrid, bodie, savvy, substance, s1x,
psyclone, polymorph, barby, vixen, lilo, elux,<br>
#2600-uk, #darkcyde, #feed-the-goats and all the other
people/channels/groups/whatever that we failed to include.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3">BIG greetz to ginger, for just
being herself :-)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3">And just as a final note, please
write in normal text, not the 31337 talk, it looks much more
presentable.</font></p>
