Okay, Heh, here's what's up. sgijoe came outta no where and dissed people... No,
we aren't one of these people.. but I thought that you people should see what we
had to say on the subject... This is a real conversation, an acutal log *Snip* is someone's
name... mmk? We don't wanna make enemies, so we took the names out of the HTML.
sgijoe... look at what people think... No one likes people dissing each other, and these people
did nothing to do. Don't diss people if they're cool with you.... mmmmmk?</h4></center><p><p>
