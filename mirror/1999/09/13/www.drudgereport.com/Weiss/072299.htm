<B><font color=red>America's One China, Two Alka Seltzer Policy</font></B><br>
July 22, 1999
<br><br><br>
With mounting whispers of nuclear ambitions, internal
strife, and a simmering showdown with Taiwan in the
air, China is very much on our minds.
<br><br>
That means it's time to take another long, boring look
at foreign policy. It isn't sexy or cute, and it
doesn't make us cry (though the good Lord knows it
should). It sure doesn't have that mini-series touch
we've come to expect from current events. It's not
even fun to write about.

Still, it matters: particularly since it appears that
the Clinton administration isn't altogether prepared
for whatever might come next. Mr. Clinton's China
policy (which didn't take shape until those busy
fund-raising months that led up to the 1996
elections), is still a work in progress.
<br><br>
Of late it's come into sharper and clearer focus than
at any time since just before the 1992  elections: but
it was a very different creature, then. In '92, in the
shadow of Tienanmen, Candidate Clinton was a champion
of human rights. The pundits celebrated his
denunciations of the butchers of Beijing and his
disdain for George Bush's cynical Realpolitik.
<br><br>
Since '96, though, the president's policy has
"evolved," the butchers have become his very good
friends, and the pundits celebrate his conversion to
cynical Realpolitik. He's a 'One China' man, nowadays,
with an abiding faith in the power of global markets
to heal all ills.
<br><br>                         
A June 1997 speech by National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger set forth the new themes, promising a China
that would be "stable, open and non-aggressive; that
embraces political pluralism and international rules
of conduct; that works with us to build a secure
international order."
<br><br>
"The One China policy has worked," Berger assured his
audience back then. "And it continues to be the right
approach. It has allowed democracy to flourish in
Taiwan . . . It provides the stability needed for
growth. And it buttresses our conviction that the
Taiwan question can only be settled by the Chinese
themselves peacefully."
<br><br>
At the time, the Taiwanese Association of America
reacted angrily.  "To say 'the Taiwan question can
only be solved by the Chinese themselves peacefully,'
is as ludicrous as saying that the United States
question can only be settled by the British
themselves," wrote association president C.K. Kuo. "We
Taiwanese have emphasized time and again that we
aspire to be a full and equal member of the
international community, based on our Taiwanese
identity and culture."
<br><br>         
While, arguably, a One China doctrine has been US
policy since the 1972 Shanghai Communique (which said,
simply, that Taiwan was "a part" of China), most
administrations have implicitly supported Taiwanese
autonomy. On Mr. Clinton's watch, however, despite
that showy 1996 standoff in the Taiwan Strait, the
balance has tended to wobble increasingly toward
Beijing
<br><br>   
That reflects the notion cherished in some circles --
mostly, though not exclusively, on the left -- that if
China is only included in the world community,
especially in global trade, it will feel good about
itself, and democracy will flower.
<br><br>
"Today," Berger enthused in 1997, "China has signed on
to many [international institutions and agreements],
from the World Bank to the Chemical Weapons
Convention, from the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
<br><br>
Yet in the two years since those glowing words were so
confidently uttered, China has repeatedly violated the
spirit and, often, the letter of those agreements,
shipping illegal arms to rogue states and shamelessly
violating human rights accords (the abuses continue to
horrify international observers).
<br><br>
Chinese authorities routinely harass and arrest
dissidents, Christians, artists -- even mere
eccentrics. The wide-net crackdown that began just
before Mr. Clinton's 1998 state visit continues to
expand inexorably.
     <br><br>                         
As for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, last week's
announcement that China has added the neutron bomb to
its small but growing arsenal may not add up to a
nightmare scenario -- yet. But it's sure not good
news.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Taiwan is once again under the gun. A
recent request by Taiwan's President Lee for
"state-to-state" talks with the mainland was
interpreted as a call for a 'Two China' policy -- a
virtual declaration of independence. Beijing reacted
furiously, warning that it would use force to subdue
any move toward Taiwanese sovereignty. Amazingly, the
Clinton administration followed suit with threats to
cut off military and other assistance to Taiwan unless
Lee backs down -- a sharp departure from our usual
posture of support.
<br><br>
It's all very worrisome -- a foretaste of regional or
even global conflicts that could erupt in coming
years. The platitudes and policy reversals emanating
from the current administration are hardly reassuring.
<br><br>

Perhaps the latest crop of presidential candidates
should consider taking some time out from opposition
research, focus-groups, and polling data, to begin
meditating on what a serious foreign policy might
actually look like. I have a feeling that one of these
days, we're going to need one.
