<B>The First Couple's Chamber Pot</B><br>
August 5, 1999
<br><br><br>

"I haven't made any excuses for what was inexcusable,"
said a truculent Bill Clinton on Wednesday, engaging
in some hastily-contrived White House damage control,
"and neither has she, believe me." All that was
missing was the waggling finger.
<br><br>
By "she," he meant, of course, his wife, whose oozily
confessional "Talk" magazine interview  with
Clinton-friendly journalist Lucinda Frank had created
something of a nasty little stir all week long.

It wasn't supposed to do any such thing. As we all
know by now, it was designed to woo older female
voters in New York State (where the gender gap isn't
working for Hillary, primarily because most women know
deep down that there's got to be something radically
wrong with anyone who'd stay with a guy like Bill). 
<br><br>
The calculation was that Mrs. Clinton could win those
ladies over by hinting that her husband's appetite for
oral sex with dumpy White House interns wasn't really
his fault at all, but was, instead, the natural
outcome of his Southern Gothic childhood, torn between
two women: his mother and his grandmother. Mom and
Supermom.
<br><br>
Dutifully, Mrs. Clinton worked it in. It swiftly
became Topic A. Thanks to some shrewdly-leaked
excerpts and a lot of pre-publication buzz, the
premier issue of "Talk" was the talk of the town days
before it hit the newsstands.
<br><br>
For icing, a Hillary staffer simultaneously informed
the press that the First Couple had rediscovered
physical passion, and were spending hours together in
bed. It seems the image of a troubled presidential
childhood ("touching") combined with hints of wild but
distinctly conjugal lust ("sexy") was supposed to turn
our collective heads and send those poll numbers
skyrocketing upward.
<br><br>
Which raises only one real question: what are these
people smoking?
<br><br>
As a marketing ploy, mind you, hatched to launch a
brand-new magazine, the hubbub was remarkably clever.
<br><br>
As a political gambit, though, designed to launch a
Senate candidacy, it was almost unimaginably stupid,
and the public just plain didn't buy it.
<br><br>
Which is the real news of the political week that was.
The whole silly business marked a deliciously
catastrophic failure of those smarty-pants tactics
that have plagued our national politics for nearly a
decade now. 
<br><br>
However the focus group may have responded: whatever
the pollsters and consultants may have claimed:
however eagerly the network news-readers may have
labored to transmute this tawdry ploy into a Hallmark
moment, the fact was, it didn't work. Boy, oh, boy,
did it not work. 
<br><br>
By Tuesday evening, Mrs. Clinton was late-night red
meat, tanking rapidly on the Leno-meter (a sharper
gauge of public opinion than those overnight polls,
say what you will). The response ranged from raucous
laughter to groans of downright disgust. White House
players knew they'd have to revise history fast,
before the First Lady suffered permanent damage.
<br><br>
Which is why, by Wednesday afternoon, we saw both
Clintons, a swarm of spin-artists, and large herds of
domesticated journalists, busily insisting that Mrs.
Clinton never said any such thing, that Mr. Clinton
had a wonderful childhood, that Mr. Clinton's mom and
granny were sterling women, that the bad old
right-wingers had, as usual, completely distorted
everything in a sinister attempt to make the Clintons
look bad, and that Mrs. Clinton wasn't going to answer
one more impertinent question about personal matters,
no matter who tried to make her.
<br><br>
I'm left thinking about Ð of all things Ð Bernardo
Bertolucci's flawed but fascinating 1987 epic, "The
Last Emperor." This film told the story of Pu Yi, who
held the Manchurian throne from 1908, when he was only
three years old, until 1945, when he was swept from
power in a tidal wave of war and revolution. (After
being "rehabilitated" by the communists, he would
serve as a humble gardener until his death.)
<br><br>
The movie is rich with odd biographical tidbits,
including the fact that every detail of the emperor's
life Ð even the most intimate Ð was subject to 
ceaseless scrutiny and interpretation. For instance,
in early childhood, in one of the weirder daily
rituals of palace life, court physicians would
publicly examine the contents of Pu Yi's chamber pot
to make sure his diet was adequate and his health was
good.
<br><br>
This week, the First Couple's courtiers tried to hold
up the Clintons' chamber pot for our edification,
hoping to persuade us that its contents were a measure
of health.
<br><br>
But in a heartening display of good old American
commonsense, we soon made it clear to anyone who cared
to listen that we knew exactly what was in that pot.
