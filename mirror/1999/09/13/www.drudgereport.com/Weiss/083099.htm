<B>Being Janet Reno</B><br>
August 30, 1999
<br><br><br>

The long standoff at Waco ended on April 19th, 1993.
What had begun that February 28th with an ill-starred
show of force by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms (plagued by scandal, and desperate to redeem
itself) now concluded with terrible suddenness, in
fire and death and chaos. 
<br><br>
Within minutes, the inferno had consumed David Koresh
and his Branch Davidians -- more than 80 souls, many
of them children.

Millions of us witnessed the final assault live, as it
happened, albeit from the abstract distance of a
remote lens, and through the filter of a highly
politicized press. 
<br><br>
Yet almost at once it melted into unreality. It was as
if the facts -- the protracted siege, the shifting
narratives, the sudden deaths of so many unseen,
unimaginable people -- were too painful to
contemplate. 
<br><br>
At the White House, while the president ducked and
covered, his War Room went to work to neutralize the
potentially toxic effects of Waco.
<br><br>
Their greatest asset was the national press, which
crumbled at once into stunning passivity, megaphoning
White House spin and trotting out push-polls that
asked the questions the White House wanted asked. 
<br><br>
Did the people blame their government, the polls
inquired: or did they believe that David Koresh had,
in the infamous phrase, 'brought it on himself'? (This
is the language rapists and wife-beaters use, to blame
their victims.) 
<br><br>
Instead of probing the official account and demanding
answers to troubling questions (it took the internet
to do that), many establishment journalists worked
with the administration to silence and discredit its
critics.
<br><br>
Through the power of the press, they transformed the
Davidians from people who (whatever their tics) were
mostly sincere, rather sad individuals who simply
longed for the communion of faith, into monstrous
cartoons -- cultists, child-molesters, subhumans who,
having resisted their government, deserved to die.
<br><br>
Overnight, the press remade Attorney-General Janet
Reno as a kind of secular saint, adored for her
mournful declaration, endlessly repeated, that she
accepted full responsibility for Waco. She did it, as
we know, for the children. 
<br><br>
Yes. Well. This is the Clinton Era, and 'accepting
full responsibility' means never having to say you're
sorry. 
<br><br>
To this day, at any whisper that she should perhaps
have stepped down as a sign of genuine contrition, Ms.
Reno sullenly reminds us that she herself has suffered
dreadfully because of Waco, that no-one will ever know
how deeply she has suffered, and that she would give
anything for it never to have happened, so that she
might have been spared all that suffering.
<br><br>
But it did happen: and it happened despite the fact
that many of the charges brought against the Davidians
were controversial at best. 
<br><br>
The lurid charge that David Koresh had sexually abused
children in the compound (it was this one,
predictably, that galvanized the spinsterish Ms. Reno
into authorizing the final assault) had been
investigated in 1992 and dismissed as unprovable and
very probably unfounded. 
<br><br>
Even the more substantive charges involving violations
of gun laws can hardly have justified the deadly
initial attack on a compound filled with women and
children: or the long siege, with its bizarre
psychological tactics that so intensified the terror
within the compound.
<br><br>
Recent revelations have torn this old scar wide open.
We've learned that despite persistent official
denials, the government did use pyrotechnic devices on
the last day. We've learned that members of the elite
Delta Force were present, and may have played an
active role in the assault. 
<br><br>
After six years of denials, plausible scenarios, and
agitprop, government officials, along with pro-Clinton
journalists, now play a wary game of chicken, trying
to gauge the nature and scope of the material evidence
so that they can shape the story to fit the known
facts.
<br><br>
Janet Reno isn't accepting responsibility, this time
around. Instead, she claims, querulously, to have been
deceived, and promises an investigation. 
<br><br>
Even Democrats have a hard time pretending to take her
seriously. 
<br><br>
The Clinton War Room is hard at work, denouncing the
new evidence as meaningless, or claiming that it's not
really new: or, alternatively, that it's been hatched
by sinister pro-Bush elements within the Texas
Rangers. 
<br><br>
And always, always, they chant that whatever errors
the BATF and FBI may have made, David Koresh brought
it on himself.
<br><br>                                            
At some point, though, they, and we, will have to come
to terms with the fact that on a windy April day in
1993, scores of human souls were condemned to an
agonizing death at Waco, on the flimsiest of pretexts,
without benefit of trial, for the simple reason that
their government had the power to make it happen.
