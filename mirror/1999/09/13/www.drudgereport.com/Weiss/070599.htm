<B><font color=red>Remembering Michael Dukakis</font></B><br>
July 5, 1999
<br><br><br>



Sometimes it's useful to go over old ground. There are
lessons to be learned from the familiar.
 <br><br>
In 1988, Al Gore --  engaged in a cut-throat race
against Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis for the
Democratic presidential nomination  -- made major
political hay out of a nasty scandal involving a
prisoner named Willie Horton and Massachusetts'
controversial "Prison Furlough Program." 
<br><br>
Dukakis was genuinely committed to the program, and
had worked hard to bolster it, despite serious public
concerns. In 1976, he'd actually vetoed legislation
that would have banned furloughs for first-degree
murderers, defending the practice as an essential
"management tool."

Thus, a decade later, in June of 1986, there was
nothing in the law to deny convicted murderer Horton
what was supposed to be a routine 48-hour leave. 
<br><br>
As everyone knows, Horton didn't play by the rules. He
fled, eventually arriving in Maryland, where, in April
of 1987, he viciously assaulted a young couple who had
probably never heard of the statute. When the story of
the furlough became known, Horton's brutality created
a public uproar.
<br><br>
The Maryland judge who subsequently sentenced Horton
to two consecutive life terms refused to extradite him
to Massachusetts. "I'm not prepared to take the chance
that Mr. Horton might again be furloughed . . . This
man should never draw a breath of free air again,"
said the judge.
<br><br>
The scandal heated to a rolling boil. In April of
1988, embattled Massachusetts legislators finally
killed the 16-year-old program -- without further
resistance from Dukakis.  
<br><br>
Mr Gore did not succeed in wresting the Democratic
presidential nomination from his rival (his own
campaign had come unglued), but he did succeed in
poisoning the political well, and mortally wounding
Dukakis. Willie Horton dominated the 1988 general
election, especially after a GOP operative hatched a
devastating television ad complete with a mug-shot of
the killer.
<br><br>
It was great advertising, and brilliant politics.
However, when the ad exposed Horton's race (he was
black), fuming Democrats charged the Bush campaign
(Bush the Elder, that is) with "playing the race
card."
<br><br>
Whether or not the criticism was justified -- both
parties play whole decks of "race cards" when it suits
them -- what really angered Democrats was the ad's
effectiveness. It captured the public imagination, a
vivid parable of the unintended consequences of
liberal social policies. Dukakis's lame efforts to
defend the program (which had not been without its
success stories) fell on deaf ears. 
<br><br>
As it became apparent that the flap was helping
Republicans, the ladies and gentlemen of the press
fell into one of those curious, dreamlike fits of
amnesia that overwhelm them now and again. They
ignored the underlying facts, including Dukakis's
icily detached defense of the program until public
opinion forced him to back down.
<br><br>
Critically, they "forgot" that Al Gore had been the
first to dredge up the story for use against his
fellow-Democrat. Instead, they reinvented Willie
Horton as a paradigm of dirty Republican politics,
flailing at GOP strategists for sensationalizing a
crime and putting a killer's pigmentation on public
display.
<br><br>
In the end, though, it was Dukakis -- Gore's original
target -- who was destroyed, neatly and completely.

         <blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>      *********************************** </blockquote></blockquote></blockquote> 
<br><br>
Why bother with Willie Horton, now that more than a
decade has elapsed? What's the point of all this
ancient history?
<br><br>
Simple. Al Gore is running for the presidency again,
and we who are ignorant of the past are doomed to
repeat it. Gore may not be able to wage an effective
campaign in his own behalf, but he sure as hell is
good at torpedoing the competition.
<br><br>
Just this weekend, the newspapers and talk shows were
abuzz with the weird non-story of George W. Bush's 
unexceptional stint in the Texas Air National Guard.
The story was almost certainly packaged and planted by
Gore's team, perhaps as a preemptive strike against
any attempt by the Bush campaign to explore Gore's own
Vietnam "service" (distinguished mostly, according to
some contemporaries, by the perfect martinis Gore
prepared in his luxurious Saigon hotel suite, during
his 6-month hitch as a "war correspondent"). It was a
pointless slam, and appears to have fallen flat on its
face. Nonetheless, it's an ill wind.
<br><br>
Note well: there is, so far, at least, no "Willie
Horton" in George Bush's (the Younger) past: only
allegations that some officials of the Texas Air
National Guard were once pointedly helpful to a
congressman's son. Still, complacent Republicans
basking in stories of the Bush Advantage and
delighting (prematurely) in the wilting Gore campaign,
would be wise to remember Al Gore's instinct for the
jugular, and his penchant for the back-alley smear.
