<B>Some Kind of Heroes: Mumia, Soliah, Et Al</B><br>
September 2, 1999
<br><br><br>

The furor continues over Bill Clinton's sly clemency
offer to those 16 jailed members of the FALN -- the
Puerto Rican radicals whose decade-long string of
terror-bombings left six dead and dozens injured, some
for life. 
<br><br>
Critics -- noting the vehement opposition of
prosecutors, law enforcement organizations, and even
some in Mr. Clinton's own Justice Department --
suspect it's just a political ploy, designed to boost
almost-candidate Hillary Clinton's standing among New
York's Puerto Rican voters.

The left is all for it, naturally. While some
activists express an almost theatrical outrage at the
single limp and lonely string the president attached
to the deal (a polite request that the terrorists
promise nicely to 'renounce' violence), in fact,
they're pleased as punch.
<br><br>
Some Democrats are breaking ranks, however. Among them
is Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Senator from
New York and last of the old-style liberals, who,
earlier this week, bluntly stated his opposition to
clemency. (By contrast, New York's unctuous junior
Senator, Chuck Schumer, is hedging his bets until he
can figure out which way the wind is blowing.)
<br><br>
Clintonite spin-artists have entered the fray, looking
worn and haggard these days, poor dears, after six
long years of it. Still, they pump away valiantly,
with the grim tenacity of riders in an eight-day
bicycle race
<br><br>
Why, this isn't political at all! they proclaim,
wide-eyed and disingenuous. 
<br><br>
This deal has the backing of Cardinal O'Connor himself
(so does the ban on partial birth abortion, but let
that pass). This represents the will of 75,000
petitioners from around the world. 
<br><br>
Those jailed FALN 'activists' were victims of judicial
overkill. Anyhow, if the president's motives were so
'political,' he'd have done this 14 days before the
election, wouldn't he? -- not 14 months.
<br><br>
Perfect rubbish, I hardly need add. Of course his
motives are political.
<br><br>
But they involve more than simple electoral politics.
This clemency business reflects the kulturkampf
politics of the American left, for whom the FALN is
merely the latest charm on the bracelet. 
<br><br>
Among the others: Philadelphia cop-killer Mumia
Abu-Jamal. In 1982, the former Black Panther fatally
shot a young cop named Daniel Faulkner (an act he
tacitly admitted in a recent radio interview, after
years of highly-politicized denials).
<br><br>
No matter. Weirdly certain that Mumia's the real
victim here, his defenders hail him as 'the voice of
the voiceless,' spewing out vicious polemics against
those who brought him to justice -- cops, prosecutors,
judges, the governor of Pennsylvania: even Maureen
Faulkner, widow of the murdered officer.
<br><br>
Mumia enjoys the unwavering support of the usual
dreary roster -- Ed Asner, Leonard Weinglass, Angela
Davis, Ramsey Clark, Daniel Berrigan, the ACLU.
Appallingly, the celebrated writer Alice Walker says
of Mumia that "he shows us our best self." (For those
who haven't had enough, Mumia Awareness Week takes
place later this month: September 19-25. Hold those
dates.)
<br><br>
Equally passionate are the fans of former Symbionese
Liberation Army radical Kathleen Ann Soliah. 
<br><br>
Soliah and her then-boyfriend, James Kilgore, joined
the SLA after its leaders (including the ex-con race
hustler Donald "Cinque" DeFreeze) were killed in a
May, 1974 shoot-out with Los Angeles police. 
<br><br>
With fellow-radicals William and Emily Harris, Soliah
and Kilgore plotted a retaliatory campaign of terror.
When the authorities closed in, however, Soliah
vanished, successfully evading justice for 23 years,
until her arrest this spring.
<br><br>
Once underground, the resourceful Soliah did
splendidly for herself, marrying a doctor, morphing
gracefully into 'Sara Ann Olson,' and enjoying all the
comforts of capitalism.
<br><br>
Following her arrest, she was tenderly described by a
local reporter as "an actress, gourmet cook, community
activist, and Highland Park mother of three." The Los
Angeles Times ran Soliah features under such glowing
headlines as "Charity and Acting Filled the Life of
Ex-SLA Soldier." Indignant editorialists chided the
FBI for wasting its resources to harry this
accomplished wife and mother.
<br><br>
Charges against Soliah included conspiracy to commit
murder and possession of explosives. She'd planted
pipe-bombs beneath LAPD patrol cars, in hopes of
killing cops. That none were killed was a measure of
her ineptitude, not her intentions.
<br><br>
Which brings us full-circle to the FALN terrorists.
Like Mumia and Soliah, they've become a 'cause'
amongst the kind of people who never can altogether
distinguish cause from effect. 
<br><br>
By pandering to these fashionable terrorists, the
Clintons are actually making a play for the plush,
progressive editorialists -- the people who write the
first draft of history. 
<br><br>
They're who this is really all about, of course:  not
a pack of scruffy voters who'll surely (or so the
Clintonian calculation goes) vote for Hillary in any
case, no matter who draws the get-out-of-jail-free
card.
