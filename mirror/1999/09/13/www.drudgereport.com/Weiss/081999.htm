<B>The Media: A Nose Like a Vacuum Cleaner</B><br>
August 19, 1999
<br><br><br>


As the press frenzy over George W. Bush and the
'cocaine rumor' enters a new, glittering,
sharp-toothed phase, it's depressingly obvious that
the Clintonization of American politics won't end,
after all, with the blessed departure of Mr. C.
himself, some 17 months hence.
<br><br>
Nope. The worst is yet to come.
<br><br>
Mind you, in this particular instance, it's not
altogether fair to blame Mr. Clinton.

He may be the monarch of slime, the author of a
feverish, sweaty brand of political S&M that makes one
fairly long for the cool, clean, wholesome days of U.S
Grant or Warren G. Harding. Still, it seems he didn't
start this scuffle, though he and his operatives are
making the most of it now that it's here.
<br><br>
In fact, the rumor first oozed to light from beneath
some impeccably conservative rocks: or so political
analyst Larry Sabato claimed in a CNN interview on
Wednesday. 
<br><br>
According to Sabato, operatives for Bush opponents
Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes first approached reporters
with the rumor -- an over-the-transom smear,
transparently political, lacking documentation or
substantive proof.
<br><br>
The fact that the press chose to elevate this toxic
trifle to a make-or-break issue for Candidate Bush is
enough to make a Republican oppo-researcher green with
envy. I mean, it's just not fair.
<br><br>
For contrast, consider all those alleged 'eyewitness'
reports of Mr. Clinton's own adventures with cocaine.
These may be mere rumors, too, though heaven knows
they're far more detailed than the buzz on Bush. Every
right-winger on the planet can quote First Brother
Roger Clinton's fabled claim that the president "has a
nose like a vacuum cleaner." 
<br><br>
However -- and maybe this is just as well -- it's been
virtually impossible to get this stuff aired outside
the right-wing press. Establishment journalists,
priggish about what they like to call
'Clinton-bashing,' have kept the lid on whenever
possible, whether the subject was sex, drugs,
violence, or (alas) corruption, abuse of power, failed
foreign policy, and worse.  Such coverage as they've
been unable to avoid has almost always been filtered
through a screen of almost palpable resentment of the
president's critics.
<br><br>
Lewinskygate was typical. The president's own
misbehavior was Topic A for about 36 hours. After
that, though, the focus shifted to Ken Starr's
'fanatical zeal,' hastily-contrived polls showing that
the American people didn't care, and Hillary's
Kafkaesque fantasies about a vast, right-wing
conspiracy. 
<br><br>
This press environment yielded an orgy of GOP-bashing
that almost certainly saved Mr. Clinton from ouster,
though not from impeachment.
<br><br>
By contrast, these ephemeral rumors about George W.
now dominate entire news cycles, and those of us who
follow such things are paying an awful price. 
<br><br>
We're choking on hypocrisy, for one thing. The paid
chatterers swing their partners and all change sides
in the great square dance of American political life.
Democrats (those new guardians of public morality)
demand that each squalid rumor be given full
consideration, while Republicans piously denounce
(could it be?) the 'politics of personal destruction.'
<br><br>
Meanwhile, maddened by the candidate's stubborn
reluctance to answer The Question, we dedicated reams
of newsprint to the odious debate, 'Should he or
shouldn't he?' It's unlikely the half-answer he's now
provided will silence the clamor.
<br><br>
I was one of those who said he shouldn't,
incidentally: but then, I'm descended from a man who
was burned at the stake for refusing to recant a minor
point of theology, so George W. probably did well not
to listen to me. On the other hand, he may live to
regret his Jesuitical hair-splitting as more trouble
than no answer at all. 
<br><br>
Worst of all, we can't turn on the cable these days
without seeing, for horrible instance, the spectral
visage of Joe Conasan. He smirks back at us, exhaling
venom like a visible smoke.
<br><br>
Conason is a man who looks as though he's spent his
entire adult life locked up in a basement somewhere,
far from God's good sunshine and fresh air, churning
out moldy little rumors by the gross. As he flogs the
notion that Bush's evasions of the cocaine question
have "public policy implications," even he can hardly
keep a straight face.
<br><br>
It's worth remembering that he's one of the boys who,
back in 1992, enthusiastically slimed Bush the Elder,
minting malevolent little rumors to undermine
President Bush's reputation in two key areas of
Clintonian vulnerability (sex and military service) so
as to level the playing field for young Bill. 
<br><br>
It may be something of a first in American politics
for two generations of one family to be beslimed by
the same team of players.
<br><br>
There will be other firsts, before all this is over.
To be honest, I'm not absolutely looking forward to them.
