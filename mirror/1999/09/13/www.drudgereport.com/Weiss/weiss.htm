<B>The Witches In Our Midst</B><br>
September 13, 1999
<br><br><br>

I hear from one of my well-placed high school sources
that they're still teaching Arthur Miller's 'The
Crucible' in 10th grade literature classes.
<br><br>
What's more, they're still teaching it the
old-fashioned way -- as a sermonette on what the
unrepentant left persists in calling 'McCarthyism.'
<br><br>
Miller's drama shamelessly bends history to imply that
the 17th century witch trials in New Salem Village
were merely a warm-up act for the 20th century 'Red
Scare.'

Not that it's an absolutely bad play: Miller is a
clever, if tendentious, playwright. Though he doesn't
exactly offer his audiences a jolly evening at the
theater, "The Crucible" is still watchable, unless
you're one of those low-brow types who'd just as soon
stay home and watch "Ferris Buehler" on the VCR.
(Heaven knows, I am.)
<br><br>
The trouble is, "The Crucible" is bad history --
Miller bends the facts until they scream for mercy.
It's the only way he could make them work for him.  
<br><br>
Above all, the play's smug, self-serving metaphor is
bogus: a fraud, and a rather silly one, at that. 
<br><br>
Witches were imaginary: communists were not. 
<br><br>
We've learned a lot about Red espionage in recent
years, as documents have been declassified and Cold
War secrets have been unpeeled. What we've learned
suggests that the paranoid right-wingers weren't so
paranoid, after all. 
<br><br>
Now, new evidence comes to us in a book by British
historian Christopher Andrew.
<br><br>
"The Mitrokhin Archive," based on documents smuggled
out of the USSR by Soviet defector Vasili Mitrokhin,
exposes decades of Soviet espionage in the most
amazing detail.
<br><br>
During his years as an obscure KGB archivist,
Mitrokhin, now 77, spirited hundreds of intelligence
reports (some dating back as far as 1918) out of KGB
headquarters, hiding them in his country house, in
cubby-holes under the floorboards. The notes
ultimately filled six trunks, an unprecedented
documentary treasure. They were his ace up the sleeve
when he persuaded the British to help him defect in
1992 (our CIA had given him the cold shoulder).
<br><br>
Mitrokhin's archive exposed Soviet agents who'd long
eluded discovery, like American NSA clerk Robert
Lipka, a Soviet mole since the 1960s, finally
prosecuted and convicted in 1996. 
<br><br>
Portions of the documents withheld from publication
apparently shed light on -- among other cases -- the
curious matter of Felix Bloch, the State Department
official and suspected Soviet agent who was pressured
into resigning in 1990 (he was treated as quite the
martyr by the press).
<br><br>
In Britain, several agents have been 'outed',
including an 87-year-old granny named Melita Norwood,
who spied for the Reds from 1937 to 1972. Because of
her age and her fragile demeanor, she has,
predictably, become a favorite of the British left.
The Tories, however, aren't charmed: they're grimly
pressing Tony Blair's government to explain its
failure to prosecute Mrs. Norwood, who gave British
atomic secrets to Moscow.
<br><br>
"The Mitrokhin Archives" illuminates the KGB's
elaborate disinformation and dirty tricks apparatus.
This seems, perhaps, less shocking than it might have
ten years ago. Nowadays, KGB strategies of smear and
character assassination evoke a purely domestic image:
media darling James Carville, joyously craning his
neck and glittering with creepy but calculated venom.
<br><br>
Still, the facts are startling.
<br><br>
To deflect attention from Lee Harvey Oswald's
communist credentials, for instance, KGB agents seeded
the fringes with conspiracy theories linking JFK's
assassination to 'right-wing' groups and the CIA. 
<br><br>
They concocted that ugly whisper campaign deriding FBI
Director J. Edgar Hoover as a closet queen. (Unlike,
say, Richard Nixon, or Joseph McCarthy, the
businesslike Hoover didn't provide his own rope: in
his case, it seems, they had to make it up from whole
cloth, with sequins.)
<br><br>
KGB operatives labored to marginalize Martin Luther
King, who they saw as a dangerous accomodationist. To
exacerbate racial tensions, they even forged
poisonously racist documents, making it appear they'd
been written by white extremists.
<br><br>
Pope John Paul II was a long-time target, smeared even
before he ascended to the Papacy as punishment for his
unyielding anti-communism. (The left's loathing for
His Holiness persists: in 1997, Carl Bernstein, the
red-diaper baby whose Watergate reporting helped bring
down Richard Nixon, co-authored a dim, feverish, and
largely indefensible book charging the Pope and Ronald
Reagan with a bizarre conspiracy against the Soviet
Union.)
<br><br>
As the evidence rolls in at the end of this bloodiest
of centuries, one thing is abundantly clear: whatever
it was we were dealing with, it sure wasn't a witch
hunt.
<br><br>
But my well-placed high school source indicates to me
that so far, at least, news of this revelation hasn't
made it into the classroom.
