<B>Solving Maleness</B><br>
August 23, 1999
<br><br><br>


At last week's annual meeting of the American
Psychological Association, the usual gaggle of experts
trotted out the usual bumper-sticker research. 
<br><br>

Their message: the recent spate of school shootings is
proof positive that bringing up boys the old-fashioned
way is an invitation to disaster, and we need to
reinvent maleness before it's too late.
<br><br>
Mind you, the news cycle dominates even the
ivy-covered halls of Academe nowadays: no surprise,
when you consider how most research is funded. The
school shootings are red meat for hungry academics,
who adroitly manipulate the most heartbreaking
headlines in pursuit of scarce research dollars

Among the great minds present at the APA meeting was
Harvard Medical School psychologist William Pollack,
whose field of expertise is the menace of maleness.
For two decades, he's been a player in the gender
wars, staking out his own little turf in the mushy
terrain of the feminized university.
<br><br>
"I think we have a national crisis of boys in
America," Pollack said urgently, conjuring up visions
of lads so damaged by having to memorize the rules of
manhood that they sometimes spontaneously explode into
savagery.
<br><br>
Pollack and friends argue that the shootings, along
with a miscellany of other horrors (depression,
suicide, schoolyard bullying), occur because American
boys are being raised to be too male. They need to be
rescued from such John Wayne virtues as courage and
stoicism, and taught instead to cry, and share. 
<br><br>
"For some boys who are not allowed tears," Pollack
warns, "they will cry with their fists or they will
cry with bullets." 
<br><br>
I'd have to guess that he's not counting the Menendez
brothers, who wept with gusto through two trials for
the brutal murder of their parents, thus demonstrating
that some boys can cry with bullets AND with tears.
<br><br>
Actually, despite the screaming headlines, these
violent outbursts are really exceedingly rare. Even in
this bloody decade, school shootings have hardly been
our daily bread. There were two in 1992, rising to six
by 1998, with another half-dozen incidents so far this
year, including the April horror in Littleton. 
<br><br>
Shocking, yes: each such incident is a  nightmare for
the victims, an unbearable loss of innocence for the
nation -- and an alarm bell in the night for us all. 
<br><br>
Still, they hardly represent real life for most
American kids. To argue that these shootings reveal
much of anything about the soul-state of American
boyhood is like arguing that Susan Smith (the young
mother who, in the fall of 1994, killed her two little
boys by driving them into a lake, helplessly tethered
to their car-seats) exposed the invidious impact of
feminism on American womanhood.
<br><br>
The shootings terrify us. When we send our children
off to the uncertain sanctuary of the schoolroom, we
can't help wondering, sometimes, Are we next? Is there
worse to come? Little wonder that since Columbine,
interest in home-schooling has soared, as frightened
parents struggle to create some zone of safety for
their kids.
<br><br>
But we're still overwhelmingly unlikely ever to have
to face such violence in our own lives. In a nation of
270 million people, in which tens of millions of boys
attend thousands of schools every day without
incident, Mr. Pollack's 'national crisis' hardly lives
up to its billing. 
<br><br>
Most American boys -- like most American men -- are
pretty nice fellows. They don't kill people or commit
suicide or inflict mayhem on their communities.
<br><br>
Oddly (or perhaps not so oddly), of the relatively
small percentage of males who do engage in violent
behavior, many aren't raised with a particularly
strong sense of maleness. Instead, these bad boys
frequently grow up in highly feminized environments,
going from households in which Mom is the only parent
present to schoolrooms dominated by female teachers.
Their exemplars and authority-figures are women, not
men. 
<br><br>
The First Bad Boy himself grew up henpecked, or so we
were recently told by Hillary Clinton, in her
remarkably narcissistic 'Talk' magazine interview.
<br><br>
Mrs. Clinton implied that the president's misdeeds
were byproducts of a childhood awash in feminine
feelings, as his mother and grandmother competed for
his love.  
<br><br>
Heaven knows, the man is no John Wayne. He's a bundle
of tears, hugs, and glossy chatter, a touchy-feely
emotion junkie without so much as a trace of deadly
machismo. If he were any more in touch with himself,
he'd be against the law in 27 states. 
<br><br>
Yet for all that, he's racked up a fairly spooky
record. Alleged brutal acts against helpless women:
shark politics of the most cold-blooded variety: the
carpet-bombing of other people's countries. Not
exactly warm and lambent, if you take my point.
<br><br>
Perhaps William Pollack could explain it all to me.
