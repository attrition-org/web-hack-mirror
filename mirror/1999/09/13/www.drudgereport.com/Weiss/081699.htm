<B>A Voter's Guide To The 21st Century</B><br>
August 16, 1999
<br><br><br>

The yearning for perfect democracy is once again in
vogue. You hear it from such sages as CNN's Bruce
Morton who, following Saturday's Iowa straw poll,
primmed his lips and declared, "No, Judy, this isn't
democracy." 
<br><br>
The willingness of 25,000 Iowans, brave and true, to
devote a gorgeous summer Saturday to this engaging
American moment, wasn't good enough for Bruce. Money
had changed hands, and you can't have that in a
democracy.
<br><br>
Oh, yawn.
<br><br>
Frankly, most visions of perfect democracy creep me
out. I hate these trendy blitherings that range from
future-shock stuff about electronic plebiscites
(picture a nation glued to television screens and
computer consoles, voting in real time on hot-button
issues), to the priggish paradigm of campaign finance
reform espoused by John McCain, the press
establishment, and Clintonian Democrats (which should
tell you just about all you need to know about
campaign finance reform).

Then there's the 'make democracy easy' movement, which
seeks to spare us the last, fragile burdens of
citizenship through a series of Mom-like indulgences.
Vote-by-mail. Weekend voting. Instant registration.
Don't get up, darling, Mother will get it for you.
<br><br>
Already, we can register to vote automatically when we
apply for drivers' licenses or food stamps. That's so
we won't have to figure out how to register all by
ourselves, Making us figure it out ourselves is
undemocratic, because some people find it
prohibitively difficult. (As far as I'm concerned,
these simpletons should be disqualified from ever
being allowed to vote at all, under any circumstances:
but there I go, being judgmental again.) 
<br><br>
Lately, the citizenship requirement itself is being
phased out, at least in some of our hipper
municipalities. It's, like, so unfair to bar people
from voting just because they didn't happen to be born
here. We're all citizens of the world, aren't we?
<br><br>
All these fine democratic ideals beg some questions.
<br><br>
For instance, in a world of slick image-hucksters and
Orwellian mind-games, does the left really want
binding electronic plebiscites on, say, school choice
and racial preferences? Does the right really want
them on national defense and 'progressive' taxation? 
<br><br>
And do we really think it's wise to make voting still
easier for people who can't even figure out how to
look up 'voter registration' in their local phone
book?
<br><br>
Sure, that fancy talk about opening up the process is
catchy: and it's not altogether misplaced.
Unfortunately, it's also uniquely useful to the
fascists among us, who are well aware of how easy it
is to inflate and manipulate cynicism by appearing to
invoke idealism.
<br><br>
Reformers grumble that the current GOP frontrunner has
'bought' his way to the top with the connivance of the
money establishment. Perhaps so. Still, how very odd
of them to turn around and demand that we clean up the
money mess by placing funding in the hands of the
political establishment and debate in the hands of the
press establishment. 
<br><br>
Anyhow, the same folks who moved heaven and earth to
paint Pat Buchanan's face on the GOP back in 1992 are
now indulging in a national pout because he can't
afford his own paint. 
<br><br>
They seem quite convinced that if only Tom Daschle and
Dick Gephardt could control the process -- if only Jim
Lehrer and Tom Brokaw could control the conversation
-- then the GOP frontrunner might be John W. Citizen,
or maybe even Jane W. Citizen, instead of George W.
Bush. (Sound cue: "Fanfare for the Common Man.")
<br><br>
Well, here's the thing. Though I'm a great believer in
the common man, when it comes to leadership, I prefer
uncommon ones.
<br><br>
I want a leader who's shrewd, principled, tenacious,
passionately patriotic, and canny enough to recognize
good advice when he hears it. I want somebody who
knows that we don't need a 'new' constitution for the
21st century, but rather a revitalized commitment to
the one that's seen us through more than 200 years. I
want someone who believes deeply in the nation's
institutions, not his own grandiose capacity to
transform them.
<br><br>
Like Diogenes, I'm not at all sure he's out there: but
if he is, he's the one for me. And I have the
strangest hunch that caucuses and backroom deals
(smoke-filled is no problem whatsoever)are likelier to
produce him than McCain-Feingold, the League of Women
Voters, and the editorial pages of the New York Times
all put together.
<br><br>
When you come down to it, I'd sooner settle for
old-fashioned politics, full of old-fashioned sin,
than live in a nation of democratic lab-rats clutching
their federal voter guides and staring edgily at the
tiny screen as they wait for Dan Rather to tell them
when to activate the Home Elect-Inator.
