<B>Singing The Praises Of Government News</B><br>
August 9, 1999
<br><br><br>

Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't help feeling some
slight, uneasy sense of irony -- or maybe just what
19th century literary types used to call a "shock of
recognition" -- as I glanced over yesterday's news.
<br><br>
On the one hand, there was the Clinton
administration's escalating attack on that pallid
tax-cut the poor old GOP has trotted out in hopes of
scoring some points with its grumbling, crumbling
base.

Alarms keened and thundered from every front page and
chat show in town as Clinton spinners fanned out to
throw plenty of kerosene on all available brush-fires.
<br><br>
They warned that these modest Republican proposals
were a menace to Social Security surpluses, interest
rates, and veterans' benefits, not to mention farmers,
women, children, teachers, doctors, the lame, the
halt, the blind, the chronically-worried, small furry
animals, and -- as my old friend Terry used to say --
the entire brass section of the dance-band at the
Waldorf-Astoria.
<br><br>
On the other hand, there was an odd and ominous item
from the Associated Press, tucked in almost as an
afterthought amongst back-page stories about strange
weather patterns and whimsical animals. 
<br><br>
"Government Unit to Control Flow of US News," read the
headline over a story about the formation of the
"International Public Information" group, or IPI -- a
bland, characterless name, strikingly reminiscent, it
must be said, of the bad old days of CIA covert
operations.
<br><br>
"The Clinton administration," wrote the AP reporter,
somewhat breathlessly, "dismayed by the success of
anti-American propaganda worldwide, is striking back
with an information offensive of its own: a State
Department unit that will control the flow of
government news overseas, especially during crises."
<br><br>
Putting aside the unsettling implications of the
phrase "government news," it's worth noting that
American reporters almost always say 'striking back,'
or 'fighting back,' when describing the latest
political blitzkrieg by the Clinton administration,
whether it's aimed at a bimbo eruption, a right-wing
critic, or a foreign power. 
<br><br>
The game is to convey an image of courage under fire:
the gritty little guys at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
bravely taking on formidable adversaries against all
odds. Reading such Orwellian constructions, you almost
forget for a moment that the guys at 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue ARE the formidable adversaries.
<br><br>
The IPI will, so we're told, "coordinate the
dissemination of news from the State Department,
Pentagon and other U.S. agencies," to prevent
complexities or apparent contradictions in reportage. 
The real point, of course, is to head off another
Kosovan meltdown.
<br><br>
Though it was supposed to be a triumph, Kosovo became,
in the end, quite a headache for the White House.
Substantial public doubt seeped in around the edges of
their ceaseless flow of official information, despite
the almost universal willingness of American
establishment journalists to reproduce said official
information whole, intact, and unchallenged (providing
an American moment such as we haven't seen, probably,
since 1918).
<br><br>
The people simply didn't like this war. Their
instincts were reinforced by troubling reports from
Europe, available via the internet, that contradicted
our glorious network narratives of bombs and body
counts.
<br><br>
Most American reporters (there were some standouts)
accepted each crumb from Madame Albright's hand with
all the skepticism and analytical skill of hungry
beagles. They did more stories on the wit and charm of
Nato spokesman Jamie Shea than they ever did on the
dubious atrocity statistics Mr. Shea pumped out daily.

<br><br>
By contrast, a surprising number of European newsmen
churlishly violated all the rules of modern American
journalistic etiquette by skipping off to Kosovo, and
seeing things with their own eyes, and writing about
them.
<br><br>
No fair, really: not at all cricket. Not the way
American reporters play the game. Indeed, Mr. Clinton
is reported to have barked an angry command at British
Prime Minister Tony Blair (after a week of
particularly savage Kosovo coverage by the London
press) that he get his journalists on board, the way
ours are here at home. 
<br><br>
Presumably, the IPI will help get everyone on board.
The Clinton administration would very much like to see
its foreign adventures reported by journalists around
the world the way its domestic adventures are by
journalists around the Beltway. Toward that end, it's
investing a great deal of time, effort, and taxpayers'
money.
<br><br>
Which brings us back to tax cuts. And starving
children. And wretched grannies, impoverished by
prescription drug costs. And hospitals forced to close
their doors. And -- well, you get the picture, don't
you? 
<br><br>
You certainly should. It's the only picture on the
screen.
