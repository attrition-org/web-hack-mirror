<B>The Ghost At Our Banquet</B><br>
August 26, 1999
<br><br><br>

Race is the ghost at the American banquet. It's always
there, no matter how determined we are to ignore it,
no matter how passionately we wish it would go away.
Even as old patterns of de jure discrimination fade
into history, and white bigotry is universally
repudiated, new forms of racial demagoguery rise up to
haunt us.
<br><br>
Consider Khalid Abdul Muhammed, one-time lieutenant to
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, and a truly
lethal bigot -- a major-league hater, consumed by his
animus for whites.

This charmer first came to national attention in 1993,
after he gave a speech at New Jersey's Kean College.
(Wildly popular on the college circuit in those days,
Mr. Muhammed still enjoys a weird celebrity in certain
circles.)
<br><br>
At Kean, he spewed venom at Jews and the Pope, and
called on South African blacks to rise up and murder
their white compatriots.
<br><br>
"We kill the women. We kill the babies. We kill the
blind. We kill the cripples. We kill them all," Mr.
Muhammed shouted, cheered on by his student audience .
"When you get through killing them all, go to the
g*****n graveyard, and dig up the grave, and kill them
a-g*****n-gain because they didn't die hard enough." 
<br><br>
Although the story swiftly became Topic A in New
Jersey, the national press wouldn't touch it. Then, as
now, fearing the toxic charge of 'racism,' newsrooms
avoided narratives that diverged too sharply from the
classic simplicity of black victimhood and white evil.
<br><br>
There would be no coverage of the Kean speech until
the Anti-Defamation League opened it up with a
full-page ad in the New York Times. The ad, an
overnight sensation, denounced both Mr. Muhammed and
the national journalists who, to their lasting shame,
had refused to tell the story. 
<br><br>
In the furor that ensued, reporters continued to go
through amazing contortions to avoid the appearance of
'racism.' Ted Koppel's 'Nightline,' for instance,
seemed to suggest that, while  the Nation of Islam had
its bad side (what with violence, race-hatred, and
exhortations to mass murder),its powerful anti-drug
message and emphasis on male responsibility resonated
in tough inner city neighborhoods, where it was a
force for good.
<br><br>
That's a little like saying that although the KKK may
burn the occasional cross and lynch the occasional
innocent bystander, they're still awfully sweet about
bringing food baskets to poor white folks at
Christmastime.  But let that pass.
<br><br>
Though Ted Koppel may have been willing to forgive and
forget, Mr Muhammed had become an unacceptable
embarrassment for Louis Farrakhan, then cooling his
own race-rhetoric ever so slightly in his bid to
become a national political player. In a pure spirit
of this-hurts-me-more-than-it-hurts-you, Minister
Farrakhan ousted the young man from the Nation of
Islam's higher hierarchy. 
<br><br>
Since then, Khalid Abdul Muhammed has been a free
agent in the race game. He's currently engaged in a
bitter skirmish with New York City, as he seeks
permission to stage a second annual 'Million Youth
March' on Labor Day.
<br><br>
The first, a year ago, was a nasty little exercise in
organized hate that ended abruptly with a public
brawl, as some of the 'youth' tangled with New York's
finest. Mayor Giuliani and the police force took the
brunt of the blame from the press, of course, but most
dispassionate observers agree that Mr. Muhammed and
his colleagues were determined to have a
confrontation.
<br><br>
Now, they want another one.
<br><br>
On Monday, after learning that the city had turned
down his request for a parade permit, Mr. Muhammed
offered a sample of the rhetorical style that has made
him so sought-after as an inspirational speaker. "We
want to make it clear here today that no devil,
racist, cantankerous, constipated cracker like the
mayor here, Giuliani, can stop black youth," he said,
promising that said youth would march with or without
a permit.
<br><br>
It's inevitable, I suppose, that in an era when the
word 'racist' is used casually, almost reflexively, as
a term of art to smear and discredit anyone who
disagrees with the current political orthodoxies, a
man like Khalil Muhammed can brandish it without even
some small sense of irony.
<br><br>
Creepily, even as Mr. Muhammed and his friends were
making angry noises for the edification of the New
York press corps, Democratic presidential hopeful Bill
Bradley was across town, angling for the endorsement
of notorious race-baiter and demagogue Al Sharpton,
once a marginal figure, now a power-player in New York
politics. 
<br><br>
It's a prospect Mr. Muhammed must find no end
encouraging.
<br><br>
The ghost at our banquet has a dry and cruel wit.
