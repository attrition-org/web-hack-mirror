<B>A Good Town</B><br>
August 12, 1999
<br><br><br>

Buford O'Neal Furrow. It's such an improbable name,
somehow. 
<br><br>
And such an improbable thing to have done. To walk
into a hall full of children and start firing.
Children, for pity's sake. 
<br><br>
To see a man and slaughter him calmly, easily, the way
you or I would swat a gnat.
<br><br>
True, I've detested people. Even hated some, I
suppose. Every week in church, I confess my failure to
love my neighbors as myself, and I mean it.

Still, in my lifetime, I've seen a little bit of death
and violence, and a little bit was more than enough
for me. On my worst days, I doubt I could bring myself
to hate enough to wield a gun in anger: or a knife, or
a blunt instrument, or  my own bare hands.
<br><br>
So for me (as for most of us) Buford Furrow is an
enigma. Unimaginable. Scary. Outside the boundaries.
<br><br>
Which is what makes it so hard to understand what
they're all saying -- the experts, the bright boys and
girls -- not just about Buford Furrow, but about the
rest of us. 
<br><br>
Especially about the rest of us.
<br><br>
Americans, they assert, have this tendency toward
violence. We're a violent people with a culture of
violence. (They're saying this in the foreign press,
too: in countries that have, in the last 100 years,
spawned two world wars, and genocide, and bloody
skirmishes and civil wars and terrorist outbreaks,
with a body count topping 100 million.)
<br><br>
We Americans are preoccupied with guns, they say. With
power. With maleness. With whiteness. It's all around
us, in the air we breathe. We're natural-born killers.
<br><br>
I step out into my garden on this August evening. It's
been perfect, since the heat-wave broke. Clear,
brilliant days: nights so cool you need a sweater to
sit outdoors after dark.
<br><br>
Tonight, there's a late summer melancholy in the
darkness. You hear the sighing of trees, and distant
laughter that ripples gently before falling and
fading. At night, in my garden, the white flowers seem
to rise up into the moonlight, while the greenery
recedes into shadow. It's remarkably beautiful.
<br><br>
My neighborhood is a peaceful place. My neighbors are
good people. This is a good town. 
<br><br>
Once in a while, something awful happens here. Earlier
this summer, teenagers on a spite-spree painted
swastikas on some houses. There's been a murder here
this summer. The first in years: a crime of passion.
Last month, two kids died of heroin overdoses within
days of each other. Nice kids, from nice homes.
<br><br>
These things frighten us. Waves of fear shiver through
the town, and we can't help wondering: Is it true what
they say, then, the experts, the pundits? Are we going
to hell in a handbasket? 
<br><br>
Have we become part of that whatever-it-is they claim
is happening out there? That 'culture of violence'?
That 'moral decay'? Do we need to be revised, fixed,
cured, purged, transformed, legislated, purified?
<br><br>
Here, in this middle-sized town in the Middle West,
life goes on 365 days a year. These are decent people
here. They marry, and raise kids. They worship the
Lord. They participate in school and civic activities.
They paint their houses, and mow their lawns, and help
their neighbors in times of trouble. They work very
hard indeed. 
<br><br>
Their hard work yields varying degrees of affluence.
There are pleasant neighborhoods, like the one where
we live. There are some poor, sad neighborhoods, where
good people struggle stubbornly against the competing
forces of drugs and booze and malignant indifference.
(These good people refuse to give up or give in.
Sometimes, they score small victories. They make a
difference. They endure.)
<br><br>
There are gorgeous neighborhoods, too. Now and again,
the girls and I drive down those splendid streets,
sighing (from longing, not from envy), as we each pick
'our' house -- the one  we'd live in if only we could.
<br><br>
This is not a violent town. Yes, bad things happen
here sometimes: horrible, heartbreaking things. This
is the turbulent human world we inhabit, not some
heavenly hereafter. Still, it's good, here. We are not
Buford O'Neal Furrow. We don't need to be revised,
fixed, cured, purged, transformed, legislated, or
purified. 
<br><br>
We don't need Tom Brokaw and the New York Times to
bemoan our 'innate' violence. We don't need
sermonettes from the newspapers of Israel, or Northern
Ireland, or Germany, or Bosnia. Mostly, we don't need
to give in to this eerie self-loathing -- this
all-American version of what the Red Chinese call
'criticism and self-criticism.' 
<br><br>
What we need, instead, is to keep the faith, and
persevere.
