<B>Thinking Over This Tax Cut Thing</B><br>
July 29, 1999
<br><br><br>

Karl Marx said that history always repeats itself, 
first as tragedy, then as farce. Watching the current
tax-cut debate, you're tempted to believe that at
least he got the farce part right. 
<br><br>
In the 1980s, critics accused Ronald Reagan of using
tax cuts to beguile a gullible public. The president's
real agenda, they hissed, was to halt the expansion of
federal government initiated by FDR half-a-century
earlier -- even to reverse it.

They were right. Smaller, less intrusive government
was precisely what President Reagan had in mind --
it's not as if he ever made any secret of it -- and
tax-cuts were a dandy way to gain broad public
support.
<br><br>
Despite high-decibel agitprop from the left
(inevitably, they excoriated the tax-cutters as
racist, greedy, and hard-hearted), Mr. Reagan
prevailed.  Tax rates were slashed and federal
revenues soared. The wheezing, battered economy he'd
inherited from Jimmy Carter -- crippled by high
interest rates and the regulating frenzy of the 1970s
-- began to show signs of life. After a few
recessionary wobbles, the U.S. economy was soon on a
sounder footing than it had been at any time since the
early 1960s, before Vietnam and the Great Society came
along to alter the equation.
<br><br>
Congressional Democrats frantically spent the new
revenues, laboring to nourish the federal beast as the
president labored to starve it. Enacting expansive new
social programs, they triggered the deficits that
would become, ironically, a propaganda coup for their
side. For his part, Ronald Reagan compromised on
domestic spending, signing costly new programs into
law to ensure Congressional support for his national
defense build-up. 
<br><br>
His priorities, unlike theirs, were not misplaced.
Under his leadership, the U.S. went on to win the Cold
War. What's more, in the end even deficit spending
couldn't erode the economic fundamentals of the Reagan
recovery.
<br><br>
Flash forward to 1999, and the brouhaha over a GOP
proposal to cut taxes by some $792 billion over ten
years -- a modest portion of those huge (though, let's
face it, probably fictitious) projected budget
surpluses.
<br><br>
Mind you, public discourse has gone downhill since
1980, when, as my friend Betty recently observed, even
"Time" and "Newsweek" still occasionally ran hard news
stories. In our brave new political world, we leap
past sober discussion into a brawl of symbolisms.
Charts and props, Larry King, Jesse "The Bore"
Ventura. Citizens unfurled in rows like animated
backdrops, nodding and blinking as politicians spit
out sound-bites.
<br><br>
However, beneath the new trappings, this is the same
old struggle. The left is still hellbent on feeding
the beast. The right still aims to starve it.
<br><br>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently
warned Congress against the Clinton administration's
new spending proposals. Emphasizing that his own
strong bias is for debt reduction rather than
tax-cutting, he nonetheless conceded that the GOP's
cuts would do less lasting harm to the economy than
Mr. Clinton's burgeoning entitlements.
<br><br>
Greenspan has it about right. This isn't an especially
logical moment for tax cuts. It would probably make
more sense to use whatever surpluses may actually
exist, to draw down the debt. If we must choose,
though, surely it's better to send that money home to
the people who made it, for safekeeping, than to allow
it to be swallowed up by Mr. Clinton's roughly $1
trillion in proposed new entitlements.
<br><br>
Conservatives are afraid: and not without reason. They
may lose the fight this time around. Mr. Clinton's
cynical initiatives (really just a high-stakes
power-grab by the left) have been carefully polled and
focus-grouped, and will play well in the coming
campaign. If enacted, they'd sap the economy without
easing human suffering, but never mind: they've
received the imprimatur of those secular bishops, our
network newsreaders. It's heresy to disagree.
<br><br>
Come to think of it, Marx is wrong again. Despite
elements of farce, when all's said and done this
particular recycling of history has the potential to
be quite a tragedy.
