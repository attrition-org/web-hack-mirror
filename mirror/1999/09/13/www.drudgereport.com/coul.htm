Well, there’s good news and bad news coming out of the Iowa straw polls.  
Lamar!  is Quitting!  -- his quixotic, some would say preposterous, quest for 
the presidency.  That’s the good news.  But the bad news is we haven’t gotten 
rid of Liddy Dole, yet.  Since she’s a Democrat, and she’s running in a 
Republican primary, it’s only a matter of time.  But, for now, she’s still 
with us.
<br><br>
Though she registers high on name recognition, on account of her famous 
husband (you know him from all those “erectile disfunction” commercials) she 
surprised a lot of Republicans by coming in even a distant third behind 
George Bush Jr.  and Steve Forbes.  But observe carefully the statements of 
her supporters.<br><br>

One of Liddy’s backers explained his vote for Dole in the Iowa straw poll by 
noting that he was a Democrat.  Quoted in the New York Times, this Democrat 
for Liddy Dole, Dennis Endicott, said that he voted for Dole in order to 
weaken support for the Republican front runner, W, to hurt him in the general 
election -- the general election in which Mr.  Endicott will vote for the 
Democrat.  This is not an isolated incident.  A few days later, the 
Washington Post quoted a Dole enthusiast in New Hampshire who was torn 
between Dole and Bill Bradley.  Bradley, you’ll recall, is a candidate for 
president in the Democratic primary.
<br><br>
It’s somewhat surprising that Democrats so easily recognize Dole as one of 
their own, in light of her steadfast refusal to take positions on anything.
<br><br>
After actually forgetting what her own position was on federal-funding for 
abortion, she accused the press of using the abortion issue to "stir 
Republicans up so they're fighting each other. . . . I just don't think we 
want to go down that path.” Things would be so much easier if the Republican 
candidates simply distinguished themselves on things like Best Fruit Punch 
For The Fraternity Mixer.  <br><br>

But lets be fair -- Dole has clearly articulated positions on a variety of 
subjects, like the military (she’s for strength and readiness) education 
(she’s for disciplining ruffians) and national security (she opposes allowing 
the Chinese to steal nuclear secrets).  That will be helpful in 
distinguishing her from the candidates who favor an anemic military, 
permissive education, and spying by the Red Chinese.<br><br>

W, the frontrunner, hasn’t exactly been a fountain of specific policy 
proposals either.  But that’s because he is “W, the frontrunner.” When you’re 
already everyone’s favorite Rorsach blot, laying out the particulars can only 
hurt you.  
<br><br>
In Dole’s case, it’s not that she already has all the support and money she 
needs, it’s that clarity on her positions won’t be a big help in a Republican 
primary.  She’s a Democrat.  Iowa’s over.  Now she needs actual Republicans 
to vote for her.  
<br><br>
Calling Dole a Democrat isn’t an epithet, it’s just a fact.  I have nothing 
against Democrats, per se, I just don’t want them in office.  But mainly, I 
can’t figure out what a Democrat would be be doing in a Republican primary.  <br><br>

Let’s review the evidence on Liddy’s party affiliation.  After graduating 
from Harvard Law School (that’s your first hint) Dole went straight to 
Washington to be a government bureaucrat with the Department of Health, 
Education and Welfare.  She was a registered Democrat.<br><br>

Still a registered Democrat, Dole’s next perch was on President Lyndon 
Johnson's Committee on Consumer Affairs.  She stayed on in that office when 
President Nixon came in, switching her party affiliation <not> to become a 
Republican, but an Independent.  <br><br>

Only when she married Bob Dole, who in his pre-Viagra days was known as “tax 
collector for the welfare state,” did Liddy finally register as a Republican. 
 As a “Republican” she became Ronald Reagan’s Secretary of Transportation, 
officially establishing herself as every administration’s Favorite Woman 
Cabinet Member.  At Transportation, she was responsible for such great 
Republican policies as forcing all the states to impose 55 mile an hour speed 
limits or lose federal highway funds.  
<br><br>
Still not persuaded?  One morning she stopped all employees of the Department 
of Transportation at the gate to the parking lot with a Stop sign -- to make 
sure they were all wearing their seat belts.  
<br><br>
In her current campaign, the only position Dole has taken (apart from 
favoring a “strong” military, “good” schools, and “no” Chinese spying) is to 
support the ban on so-called “assault” weapons.  But we need so-called 
“assault” weapons. Otherwise, some government busy-body might get the bright 
idea of stopping us to make sure our seatbelts are fastened
