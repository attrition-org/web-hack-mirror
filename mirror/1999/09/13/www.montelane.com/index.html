     <dd>My appologies to the owner of this website...I've never heard your music before, and I
     don't have the time to download one of your demos...all I have to say is that your webpage
     looks pretty crappy and well the security on your system ain't that great either...
     <br><br>
     <dd>Anyhow on to the important things...I am bored, and well going through all the 
     <a href="http://www.attrition.org/">attrition.org</a> <a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/">mirrors</a>
     makes me realize how long it's been since I had some fun...
     <br><br>
     <dd>I have no real statement to make besides the few things which are fucked up right now...
     the slaughter in East Timor, the censorship in Australia and as much as I dislike Mitnick,
     he shouldn't be in jail for so long...
     <br><br>
     <dd>Now that my ranting and raving is over I will let you be and tell your loyal web visitors
     that your webpage wasn't deleted and can be accessed by clicking <a href="index.bak.html">here</a>...
     Once again my appologies to you for doing this to your webpage...Just delete "index.html" and rename
     "index.bak.html" to "index.html"...and change your password if you want...

      <dd><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;When all else fails you can be sure we will fail too...</i>
     </ul>
     <br><br>
     <dd>P.S. I have no greets because I don't know the "<i>web defacing</i>" scene members...except
     v00d00 sounds familiar......anyhow...hey to all of you and what not...
     <br><br>
     <dd>P.P.S. The background is from the old tacd page...I liked it way back then and I still do...
     credit to them...
