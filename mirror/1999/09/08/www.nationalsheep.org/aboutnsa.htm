<P>Programs:  The BDC will work to make businesses with the industry stronger, more competitive, and more successful.  Conceived as a highly creative, dynamic business development consulting firm, the scope of R &amp; D activities and business services will include:</P>
<P>&#9;1.  Product development</P>
<P>&#9;2.  Venture feasibility</P>
<P>&#9;3.  Market clearinghouse</P>
<P>&#9;4.  Enable/negotiate industry alliances</P>
<P>&#9;5.  Business services such as business planning, access to capital, grant &#9;&#9;     writing, contract guidance, etc.  </P>

<P>The BDC will enable the development of new ventures but will not take an ownership position in any venture that is competitive with an exiting business.  On the other hand, the BDC could research, implement and operate an entrepreneurial venture of benefit to the industry as long as the venture is not present in the industry, e.g., a pelt collecting venture.  </P>

<P>Procedures:  Business development ideas will be generated internally from the Forums, NSA Board, members, industry plans, etc., and externally from businesses, institutions, individuals, etc.  Ideas will be presented to the BDC Board in the form of a brief proposal.  Confidentiality will be assured throughout the entire R &amp; D selection and implementation process.  The cost of R &amp; D projects will be determined and strategies for financing prepared and implemented.  Access to the BDC will be available to Association members.  An access fee in lieu of membership dues will be assessed on non-members.  </P>

<P>Structure:  The BDC is envisioned as an independently managed and financed department or division with the National Sheep Association with its own governing board and staff.  While the BDC will be capable of putting together the financial resources needed for its business development activities, it is not likely to generate funds for the Association.  Benefits to members will come from the new products, alliances, cooperatives, etc. developed by the BDC as well as from services provided.  </P>

<P>Governance:  The BDC will be managed by a 7 member board with strong business and sheep industry expertise.  Member commitment to the sheep industry is critical.  Board members will be required to maintain strict confidentiality and recess themselves in the event of personal or business conflict.  </P>
