If you've come this far you're either really curious or amazingly bored.  The kind of bored that would make watching the grass grow seem exciting.  Alright, for the sake of argument let's say you're curious.  Then the following shameless self-promotion should fill your needs, and then some.  Don't say I didn't warn you.

Of course, that really is my name.  Welcome to the world that exists in my mind.  I created this world to amuse myself and my friends.  I hope you enjoy it as well.  The following is bits and pieces of me and my life.  I can't promise they'll make any sense.

<H2><IMG SRC="img/world.gif"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"> Who is "J"?</FONT></H2>

A good question, and one which mystifies me on a daily basis.  How does 
anyone sum up themselves?  Are we what we do for a living, where we grew up, 
where we went to school, or who our friends, parents, or children are?  
Identity is an elusive thing.  It almost always defies attempts to 
categorize or simplify it, despite our apparent need to try.  Humans 
have a curious, albeit understandable, need to generalize and simplify 
everything; to refer to so-and-so as <I>the painter</I> or such-as-such as 
<I>that guy with the limp</I>.  We label someone with some small attribute 
of themself and the label inevitably becomes the person.  That's how last 
names came into being hundreds of years ago.  This may make that person 
easier to remember but we miss so much when we place that person in a box.  
Taoist physicist Fritjof Capra, through one of his characters in his 
wonderful film, <I>Mindwalk</I>, states that "<I>life is infinitely more 
than our ability to reduce it</I>."<BR>
<BR>

As for me, I'm no more nor less complex than anyone else, although that's 
still saying a lot because the complexity of human experience is quite vast.  
And I feel compelled to point out that everyone is just as valuable as 
everyone else, despite elitist dogma to the contrary.  I am continually outraged by claims that some group of people (such as a religion, race, or nation), or even some individual, is somehow 
superior to everyone else.  That sort of conclusion is based solely on what 
is considered to be a valued characteristic and is almost always the 
definition of the group claiming to be superior.  In other words, if the 
ruling class, who has money, declares that having money makes one a superior 
person, and I have no money, then by their definition I have no value to 
society.  Yet if I turn out to be the next Monet but die penniless, as he 
did, will I not have made a significant contribution to society?  We 
desperately need to expand our definitions of what makes a person worthwhile.  
And I believe, at least to a certain degree, that this problem is a direct 
result of our propensity to pigeonhole people and to judge them based on the 
labels that we place on them.  We do the same thing to so-called backwards peoples 
when we try to impose our set of values on them and view them through our 
set of morals.  Naturally, they never measure up and we conclude, quite 
incorrectly, that we're better than they are.  Semiotician and author 
Umberto Eco wrote a brilliant satirical essay in which he reverses this 
by having a tribesman of a pacific island visit present day Milan and 
look at Italian culture as an anthropologist.  He finds western customs 
incomprehensible and declares us, quite correctly, to be an inferior and 
savage people.<BR>
<BR>

Not that any of this makes any difference, though, now that quantum physics 
has finally shown the age old claim of the taoists, that we are all one, 
to be correct at the sub-atomic level.  And if we're all one, division 
is ultimately pointless.  So all of you out there feeling smug about your 
superiority; get over yourself.  Like it or not, you're part of a 
completely interconnected web of life in which nature couldn't give a damn 
if you own a BMW or descend from a royal blood line.  If you're still 
curious about "J", perhaps you can draw some of your own conclusions from 
my short biography which follows below, just don't expect 
any simple answers from me about anything.  I've also compiled a list of my <A HREF="faves.html">favorites</A> in a number of different categories, which may provide some additional insight, and may provide a basis for my ultimate commital.

<H2><IMG SRC="img/world.gif"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"> Opinions</FONT></H2>

If you haven't figured it out by now, I have very strong opinions about most things.  As a form 
of catharsis, I write a <A HREF="rant.html">diatribe</A> 
in which I rant about my opinions, beliefs and ideas on a different subject 
from time to time.  Also, mini-diatribes appear in almost every <A HREF="letter_j.html">Letter "J"</A>, The Daily Globe's Weekly Newsletter.  I try to resist the critic's tendency to be entirely negative without offering any solutions, although often there aren't any easy answers.  
I feel confident at least a few people will be offended by what I have to say because people seem to think my views tend toward the more extreme, or at least are outside the mainstream.  Personally, I think of myself as a fairly balanced taoist and moderate realist and I never agree with everything said by either liberals, conservatives, or any other group.  My diatribes are based solely on my opinions, and often those opinions are not as well informed as they could be because it's virtually impossible to be fully and completely informed about everything.  Recognizing this, I am very open to adapting and changing my views based on new information or other's ideas.  I am not rigidly steadfast in my opinions and instead am constantly altering and refining them and, importantly, I'm willing to admit I'm wrong when I am; qualities I strongly believe more people should adopt.  Accordingly, I would love to have your thoughts, response, comments, disagreements, or whatever, to my diatribes.  I reprint the most interesting responses and comments I receive, along with the original monograph and my reply, if I feel it necessary, in a <A HREF="rant-arc.html">Diatribe Archive</A>.  If you want to ask me anything, fill out the <A HREF="askj.html">Ask "J" Anything</A> online form.  At least the best question of the week is reprinted along with my answer and previous answers can be found at the Ask "J" <A HREF="answers.html">Answers</A> Archive.

<H2><IMG SRC="img/world.gif"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"> Biography of "J"</FONT></H2>

"J" was born and raised in Dutch Wonderland, in the middle of Pennsylvania Dutch (or Amish) Country, better known as Berks County, Pennsylvania.  He spent most of his childhood in the small suburban town of Shillington, famous only as the birthplace of author John Updike.  Childhood was mostly idyllic, except for the usual alcoholic stepfather traumas.  "J" characterizes himself as a young child as "pretty much like <I>Calvin</I>" except instead of a tiger he had a Rabbit (like <I>Harvey</I> except you could see it).  He spent a lot of time in the woods behind his grandmother's, was a boy scout (really), was involved in community theater, and even attended church.  After high school, "J" played in an Army Band and was stationed in New York City.  After being honorably discharged, he attended college in Reading, Pennsylvania (it's the 1st Railroad in Monopoly) and worked full-time managing record stores.  Stupidly married too young, "J" was promoted to Buyer and moved with his then-wife to North Carolina and bought a house and a dog.  After financial troubles hit the company, he lost his job, his wife, and worst of all, <I>Gidget</I>, his dog.  "J" then switched professions and became Director of Marketing & Advertising for a local chain of video stores.<BR><BR>

Citing this as a turning point, "J" fell in love with a UNC student he met working at the video company, Chantal, and moved with her to California where she was to attend law school.  The relationship didn't survive her first year of law school, although a close friendship endures to this day.  After a string of McJobs, "J" took a position with a video store chain where he met close friends Keith and Sean, who were working there part-time while they were in high school.  This was his introduction to Big "G", a large tightknit group of friends he's still close to ten years later.  "J" started working at this time writing for a law office, a job which he labored at for over eight years.  After Keith and Sean finished high school, "J" roomed with Keith for a few years and then lived with some other friends.  About this time, he and friend Karen wrote and published a book reviewing every bar in Santa Clara County, entitled <A HREF="beer/beer.html">The Bars of Santa Clara County: <I>A Beer Drinkers Guide to Silicon Valley</I></A>.  After that "J", Keith, Michelle, and Kristine shared a house, dubbed Sarcasm Central, along with Keith.  After the lease was up on Sarcasm Central, the four went their separate ways and "J" lived by himself in Sunnyvale for a year.<BR><BR>

VSPACE=4 HSPACE=4>

Another turning point hit in June of 1994, when "J" met Sarah at his work and it was love at first sight.  After successful hypnosis, she agreed a few months later to marry him and they moved in together near Santa Clara University while she finished her undergraduate schooling.  After poking and prodding by family and friends they finally managed to get their act together and plan a wedding.  They were married July 13, 1996 in the San Jose Rose Garden with a reception at the Tied House Microbrewery.  After a honeymoon visiting breweries in the Northwest and San Juan Island, the couple settled in Berkeley, California.  In the fall of 1996, Sarah began attending law school at Boalt Hall (Berekeley's law school) and "J" got a job buying beer.  And the great american novel he started ten years ago remains unfinished.<BR><BR>

"J" keeps busy with his new job and working on the Daily Globe, a new card game, and, of course, his great american novel.  New passions include late bottle vintage port wine, pub glasses, and trying to simplify his life.  Sarah has caught the gardening bug in a major way and her chief concern was, until just recently, figuring out how to keep their Rabbit, Jools, from eating everything she plants.  Tragically, Jools was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and died in early June 1997. She's buried under a bramble of rose bushes in the back yard.
