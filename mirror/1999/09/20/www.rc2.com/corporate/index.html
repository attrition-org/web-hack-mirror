<p>
<b>Reservoir Characterization Research and Consulting, Inc.</b> provides world-class consulting, training, 
and software tools in the field of integrated reservoir modeling.  Our distinctive competencies and 
competitive advantage are embodied in the breadth of expertise and education of our consultants.  
We have specialists in geology, geophysics, and reservoir engineering, and each has extensive working 
and theoretical knowledge of geostatistics.   Every consultant is intimately involved in both project 
work and software programming.  This combination permits us great flexibility to respond to the 
uniqueness and idiosyncrasies inherent in any reservoir.  The fact that our software is a direct 
outgrowth of applied project studies, both by us and our clients, is primarily responsible for the 
tremendous success and growing adoption rate of our stochastic modeling package within the industry.  
Our computer programs are used by oil companies (operations and research groups), universities, 
government agencies, and national laboratories. Biographies of our consultant staff are available at this link, <a href="../biographies/consultant.html">consultant staff biographies</a>. Biographies of our software developers are available at this link, <a href="../biographies/software.html">software staff biographies</a>. Biographies of our executive and support staff are available at the following link, 
<a href="../biographies/admin.html">administrative staff biographies</a>.
<p>
(RC)<font size="-1"><sup>2</sup></font> is the recognized industry leader in the integration of diverse data types, especially core, 
well-log and seismic-based information.  Testimonies to our claim include being the third-party 
provider of stochastic modeling to Landmark's product line and being the preferred vendor on every 
major oil company survey in which we have participated.  Our consultants have been involved as 
principal investigators in reservoir characterization projects throughout the world in both siliciclastic 
and carbonate depositional regimes.  In particular, we have extensive experience in the North Sea, 
Gulf of Mexico,  West Texas, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, South China Sea, Rocky Mountain basins, 
East Newfoundland basin, and onshore and offshore California.  We have been involved with diverse 
engineering objectives such as predicting and quantifying the prediction uncertainty in reservoir 
volumetrics and reserves, breakthrough times, recovery rates, delineation drilling, and monitoring of 
CO2 flood fronts.
<p>
Our software tools are designed to span the traditional gap between interpretation and the fluid-flow 
simulator (although we are developing our own fluid flow simulator).  These tools include not only 
the integrative stochastic modeling programs, but seismic 
inversion, uncertainty analysis, and upscaling functions.  We are able to model continuous (e.g., porosity), 
categorical (i.e., facies), and categorical to continuous (facies dependent) properties.  If 
3D deterministic models have been built, they can be used to constrain the stochastic processes.  
The level of sophistication we can bring to bear on the modeling problem is directly dependent upon 
the complexity of the geologic scenario, the quantity and diversity of the available data and 
interpretations, and the ultimate engineering objectives to be addressed.  Our seismic inversion approach 
is specifically performed to preserve the inherent imperfection of predicting the reservoir parameter 
of interest, yet maximizing the seismic pseudo-logs contribution when integrated with well-log data.  
Other techniques permit us to constrain 3D reservoir models with 2D seismic attributes.  Our 
upscaling methods are based upon traditional Darcy law algorithms and upon non-traditional techniques 
employing pressure solutions and flow distributions. 
<p>
We at (RC)<font size="-1"><sup>2</sup></font> are practitioners, teachers, and tool developers.  It is because we integrate 
these three functions and remain focused that allows us to stay the best in our specialty 
of integrated stochastic modeling.
