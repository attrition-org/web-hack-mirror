<font size="+1"> 
ResMod 2.0 is nearing an imminent release. </font>
<p>
ResMod 2.0 is close to a complete rewrite of the algorithmic features of ResMod to
address performance, stability, and consistency. 
<p>
With ResMod 2.0  there will be no separate production/development versions. There may possibly be
some experimental options but the key algorithmic kernel will be the same. 
<p>

<font size="+1"> 
Faster, Better, Cleaner </font>

<p>
There have been tremendous algorithmic speedups, up to 100 times, especially with the facies 
algorithms. In
addition, there is full consistency in the Indicator Kriging/Probability Field and Sequential
Indicator Simulation approaches to Facies simulation.  The menus and panels have been redesigned to present
as many of the options as possible up front. Now Property (Continuous) Log modeling and 
Facies(Categorical) Log modeling are  selected early in the modeling processing controlling the menus items that
are visible and enabled. 
<p>
<font size="+1"> Cleaner Grid Definition </font>
<p>
There is only type of grid but two types of surfaces, structural and
attribute. A surface is a grid with values. Therefore, what was previously known
as a random surface, which does not have a grid, is being renamed 2D data.
<p>
For example, a 40x40 cell structural surface and 40x40 cell attribute surface share the
same 40x40 cell grid. If you estimate/simulate a marker (structural) surface, values will be calculated
at the 41x41 corners of the grid and if you estimate/simulate an attribute surface, values will
be calculated at the 40x40 cells. Irregardless it is the same underlying grid. 
<p>
<font size="+1"> Control Data is Necessary Step </font>
<p>
To estimate or simulate a 3D model, it will be necessary to construct a control data
model first. The control data model is the areal grid plus the vertical grid specification
including the bounding surfaces. There will be no option to krige the marker surfaces as
the estimation/simulation is done. 
<p>
<font size="+1"> Soft Data </font>
<p>
Soft Data will have to match the dimensions of your 3D grid to be used and only
those datasets that match the 3D grid will be displayed for selection. For instance, to use
seismic as soft data it first has to be mapped to a 3D model using Control
Data. The same procedure applies to using any log as soft data as well.
This greatly reduces the algorithmic complexity. 
<font size="+1"> 
Integration with ResFrame</font>
<p>
ResMod 2.0 easily incorporates grid definitions from ResFrame and populates the
3D faulted models generated by ResFrame. There are no
artificial algorithmic limitations. 
<p>
<font size="+1"> 
HyperText  Documentation using Netscape Navigator</font>
<p>
ResMod 2.0 as well as ResGram, ResCalc, and ResPrep use hypertext documentation
with Netscape Navigator. When you click on a help button, if Netscape Navigator is
not launched, it will be launched. If it is already running than it will determine
that. Irregardless, the Netscape Browser will be pointed to the correct 
place in the documentation.

<p>
<p>
<font size="+1"> 
What's not in ResMod 2.0</font> <p>
In the interests of stability, we have removed some options 
which are little or never used but contribute enormously to the complexity of the code. There
are no curvilinear grids or surfaces, no locally refined grids and surfaces. There is
no link to IRAP-RMS. Links to Stratamodel will be maintained.
<p>

<font size="+1"> FlexLM licensing</font>
<p>
FlexLM licensing, the defacto industry standard, is the only type of license available. There is no Xnet Licensing.
