ResMod 2.0 is nearing imminent release. Click here for details (<a href="resmodnew.html">ResMod 2.0</a>).
(RC)<font size="-1"><sup>2</sup></font> has experienced rapid growth. We've expanded our staff significantly in the United Kingdom to support our EAME operations. David Gawith and Dr. Pamela Gutteridge have joined us in the London office after formerly working many years for BP and Ian Gollifer has joined us as a geophysicist in our Aberdeen office. Also, Lisa Stright has joined us as Documentation and Testing Coordinator and Beiyuan Liang to work on <a href="../products/ResSeis.html">ResSeis</a>. Look at our biography pages (<a href="../biographies/software.html">software staff</a>, <a href="../biographies/consultant.html">consultant staff</a>) to catch up on all of the new people.  <br>
We have released the cross platform <a href="../products/ResFrac.html">ResFrac</a> program. We have made extensive improvements to the <a href="resseis.html">ResSeis</a> program. Our cross platform Framework building module <a href="../products/ResFrame.html">ResFrame</a> has undergone extensive testing and is nearing beta release.<br>

<p>
We have adopted FlexLM Licensing as our standard licensing model and after Sept. 1, all of our newly released modules will exclusively use FlexLM. Click here for details (<a href="http://www.rc2.com/new/licensing.html">licensing</a>).

Our commercially-released software products continully develop and improve in efficiency. Many new salient features are added to <a href="resmodnew.html"><b><i>ResMod</i></b></a> including improved boolean simulation and improved boolean deposits to name a few. 
<p>
Project work is extremely active. (RC)<font size="-1"><sup>2</sup></font> is currently involved in a number of projects with various oil companies. Some of the companies we are currently involved with include Texaco, RWE-DEA, Intevep-PDVSA, Pennzoil, Burlington Resources, Petral Exploration, Mobil and BP-Amoco. 

<p>
(RC)<font size="-1"><sup>2</sup></font> continues to offer training in applied geostatistics and other techniques for reservoir characterization.  The courses range from 1 day workshops to one-week courses.  We have designed more than 25 computer exercises that systematically build upon each other so that many of the algorithms in our software are covered. The exercises are packed with real-world problems encountered in reservoir modeling. Click here for a <a href="../training/index.html">training schedule</a> and description of courses.

<p>
<a href="../products/ResGram.html"><b>ResGram 2.0</b></a> was released in May of 1999. 
Here are some of the 
new features
<ul>
<li> Completely revamped and highly interactive graphics
<li> Cut and paste functionality into a report editor
<li> New 3D Linked Data Analysis
<li> Online HTML Documentation through Netscape
<li> Faster Variogram Calculations
<li> Slider Vertical Variogram Analysis
<li> Easier Variogram Modelling 
<li> Tool Tip Help
</ul>
<p>
<a href="../products/ResSeis.html">ResSeis</a> now can handle deviated wells both in the wavelet estimation and inversion steps. 
<p>
We have formulated a new download policy that requires ftp access for customers who are
current on their maintenance. See <a href="download.html">download policy</a> for details.
<p>
Not exactly news since it happened last year, but RC-Squared joined the 
<a HREF="http://ekofisk.stanford.edu/SCRF.html">Stanford Center for Reservoir Forecasting</a> 
which is more commonly known as 
<a HREF="http://ekofisk.stanford.edu/SCRF.html">SCRF</a>.
