<font size="+1">Welcome to Adrian College</font>
<p>
"Welcome to Adrian College, a small, private, liberal arts college founded in
1859 in Adrian, Michigan.
<p>Since that time, we at Adrian College have never heard about something
called 'computer security'. So we installed Microsoft (R) Windows NT, because we saw on TV
that it's easy-to-install, and shit.
<p>
But... one day, tha b<b>l</b><u>0</u>w <b>t</b>e<u>am</u> niggahz owned my lame
ass in less than one minute.
<br>They told me that found many 'vulnerabilities' here...
<br>So I said 'omg... wtf. I'm 0wned. Why the hell did they target just me? @#$^%$. oh fuck. I feel like sheeit. :( '
<br>From now on I guess I'll try to learn more about this 'computer security' stuff."

<br>Now, what you'll see is just our opinion on the groups that have been dissing us.

We deface sites for fun, but we also do it when we think
it is the right thing to do.. or just coz we wanna show our fuckin powah...
Sometimes we spend an entire day to 0wn the shit, and its really more fun.
but, heh. who cares?<br>

What is A.L.O.C.? a bunch of idiots who like to deface unknown domains and diss
people that they just dont know.
<br> they also say that we call ourselves 'elitists' or something. hah.
<br>
We always have a reason for our defacements... and most of our sites are targeted.<br>
<br>
When we write a simple sentence <b>l1k3 th1s</b>, its just to keep our initial style.
It's not to say we are 'elite' (and we have NEVER said that).

<p>
Do we hack just to show up on /mirror/attrition? HAH. i didnt know that.
I used to think that bl0w was defacing sites to protest against government,
to have fun, to show people that they're vulnerable and stuff...
<br>
oh well. you then shouldn't mail hacked@attrition.org and report your hacks..
if you do this then you are just like us. @#$%^#&
<br>
This goes specially to sgi-joe:
<br>Who the fuck you think you are? We had never diss'd you.<br>
not before you started all that bullshit. 
<br>you can think what you want... cause we dont give a fuck!
<br>and pfff, 
<a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/1999/09/05/www.thecode.net/">this</a> was really fuqn stoopid.
thats the kind of shit that makes you (*ubt* or whatever) lose respect from everyone.
<br>suckuz.
