<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">News:</font></b>
<p>Hey all, Buff3 here:) odd.org is still bein worked on (and rooted:)
<br>
You had all better pheer the penguin, it rocks :)
<br>
For reference, no.. nothin was removed or whacked in this hack, and Neil
has been notified already =P
<br>
<br>
<br>(later the same day...) now whats all this you fokes keep asking for?
virtual hosts? ok.... how do I do that?
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(08/21/99) heh... GOOD MORNING!!!! ITS
SATURDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">mail is working again, it was something
here but I got my MX records ajusted so as to avoid actualy fixing it,
now all mail sent via programs like pine will have a return address of
eeehehe.odd.org instead of odd.org... it wont bounce this way so who cares,
I will get around to realey fixing it... ummmm..... when I get around to
it...&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">that huge server I was talking about a
while ago is going to come back on line sort of soon, I just gotta come
up with a pile of cash for its new disk and to finish paying for it now
that its actualy mine.... and the most fun bit is this: we may be running
at a fantastic new speed, I am debating weather to get DSL or a cable modem,
the local cable company gives out static IP addresses WOOWEEEEE!</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(08/20/99) ok.... well, so far most of
the nasty stuff is fixed, however the nastyest bit is still a problem,
the old password file either needs to be cracked or I have to remake 200+
users by hand.... what this means is that I am not going to be adding new
accounts untill I get this done.... what this means to you is that you
need to mail me and tell me what your username and password was, and I
can then rebuild your account.... fun huh? oh yah... mail is still a bit
tweeky.... that will be done by this weekend I hope..... sigh....</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(08/17/99) hmmm... well, we are starting
to fix the user accounts, its VERY slow going:</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">mail is still flipping out, I need to
mess with DNS to fix it I think....</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">BitchX will be reinstalled tonight...</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">all old mail to root@odd.org was lost
and that sucks.... I am an ass....</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the webserver/proxy is fixed....</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(08/14/99)&nbsp; We are sort of back....
theres a lot to fix still and we are working on it.... looks like it might
take a while....</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">sorry about all the delays...&nbsp;</font>
