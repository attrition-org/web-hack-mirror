<h1>ELECTION LAWS</h1>
 
<b>We call for  an  end  to  government  control  of  political  parties,
consistent with First  Amendment rights to  freedom of association and
freedom of expression.  As private voluntary groups, political parties
should  be  allowed  to  establish  their  own  rules  for  nomination
procedures, primaries, and conventions.</b><p>
We urge repeal  of the Federal  Election Campaign Act which suppresses
voluntary support of  candidates and  parties,  compels  taxpayers  to
subsidize politicians and  political views which  many do not wish  to
support, invades the  privacy of American  citizens, and protects  the
Republican and Democratic  parties  from  competition.   This  law  is
particularly dangerous as it enables the federal government to control
the elections of  its own administrators  and  beneficiaries,  thereby
further reducing its accountability to the citizens.
<p>
Elections at all  levels should be in the control of those who wish to
participate in or  support them voluntarily.  <b>We therefore call for an
end to any  tax-financed subsidies to  candidates or parties  and  the
repeal of all  laws which restrict  voluntary  financing  of  election
campaigns.</b>
<p>
Many state legislatures  have  established  prohibitively  restrictive
laws which in  effect exclude alternative  candidates and parties from
their rightful place  on election ballots.   Such laws wrongfully deny
ballot access to  political candidates and groups and further deny the
voters their right  to consider all  legitimate alternatives.  We hold
that no state  has an interest  to protect in this area except for the
fair and efficient conduct of elections.
<p>
The Australian ballot system, introduced into the United States in the
late nineteenth century,  is an abridgement  of freedom of  expression
and of voting  rights.  Under it,  the names  of  all  the  officially
approved candidates are  printed  in  a  single  government  sponsored
format and the  voter indicates his  or her choice by marking it or by
writing in an  approved but  unlisted  candidate's  name.   We  should
return to the  previous electoral system  where there was no  official
ballot or candidate approval at all, and therefore no state or federal
restriction of access to a "single ballot."  Instead, voters submitted
their own choices  and had the  option of  using  "tickets"  or  cards
printed by candidates or political parties.
<p>
In order to grant voters a full range of choice in federal, state, and
local elections, we  propose the addition  of the alternative "None of
the above is  acceptable" to all  ballots.  We further propose that in
the event that  "none of the above is acceptable" receives a plurality
of votes in  any election, the  elective office for that  term  should
remain unfilled and unfunded.
