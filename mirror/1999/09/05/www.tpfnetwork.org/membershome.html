<p align="center"><u><strong>General Assembly Meetings</strong></u></font><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p ALIGN="center">Every year, TPF convenes their General Assembly. Meetings are an
opportunity to review the operations of the TPF organization, to discuss issues that
impact the independent forwarder and global freight movement industry and to learn about
global economic and trade trends. In addition, the meeting agenda includes speakers and
industry representatives to speak on trade practices, customs regulations, economic trends
and other insightful information specific to and around the host country. </p>

<p ALIGN="center">TPF established three membership regions &#151; The Americas,
Europe/Africa and Australia/Asia. The General Assembly meeting sites rotate the regions of
the world.</font><font FACE="Fuji-BI,Lucida Sans Unicode"></p>

<p ALIGN="center"></font><font FACE="Tahoma">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><u><strong>Membership Development</strong></u></font><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p ALIGN="center">The Membership Work Group works to identify areas essential for TPF
representation and build a global alliance of independent business contacts. In order to
encourage involvement from members, TPF implemented two membership incentive programs.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">Recruitment Incentive Program: A current TPF Members that successfully
recruits a new TPF member will receive a credit to their TPF account. The credit amount
for the recruiting member is calculated as 20% of the new member&#146;s annual dues
payment and entry fee. The amount is credited once the 2</font><font SIZE="1">nd</font><font SIZE="3"> six-month installment is received by TPF. Prospective members must submit an
application and go through the standard review procedures including a credit check. The
Board of Directors will review membership applications to determine acceptance or denial.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">Prospective Member Incentive: New members that join TPF prior to the
years General Assembly Meeting and attend the Meeting qualify to receive a 50% discount on
their entry fee. </font><font FACE="Technical" SIZE="3"></p>

<p ALIGN="center"></font><font FACE="Tahoma">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><u><strong>Marketing/Public Relations</strong></u></font><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p ALIGN="center">One of the main functions of the TPF office is to implement a central
marketing and public relations program designed to raise awareness of the role of the
independent freight forwarder in the global freight movement industry. The Association
provides a menu of marketing materials for use by TPF members. Marketing pieces are
designed for use in conjunction with the individual members&#146; marketing tools. </p>

<p ALIGN="center">In addition, TPF is developing a public relations/press program to
generate press coverage and position the TPF logo in public view. The long-term
marketing/PR plan will include a broad international marketing program coupled with a
regionally focussed program.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"></font><font FACE="Tahoma">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><u><strong>Information Tracking System</strong></u></font><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p ALIGN="center">TPF joined forces with Shiptrax to offer an Internet-based shipment
information tracking system to TPF Members. TPF Members can share information on shipments
with other TPF partners through a central system. As well, customers given client access
may check for details specific to their goods. To avoid double entry of data, information
may be uploaded from a member company database through an EDI link into the Shiptrax
system. Arrangements between TPF &amp; Shiptrax brought to TPF Members and their customers
an easy to use, cost effective, fully automated tracking system. TPF and Shiptrax work
closely to evaluate and develop new capabilities for the system.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"></font><font FACE="Tahoma">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><u><strong>NVOCC/Bill of Lading</strong></u></font><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p ALIGN="center">TPF has filed an NVOCC tariff with the United States Federal Maritime
Commission and posted the required bond. TPF administers the tariff/rate filings; however,
all accounting and profit share calculations are settled directly between the members
involved in the specific traffic. TPF has an insured Bill of Lading available for use by
qualified TPF members.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"></font><font FACE="Tahoma">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><u><strong>Contracts</strong></u></font><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p ALIGN="center">TPF established a Contracts Work Group to create beneficial carrier
contracts for TPF Members. The work group coordinates efforts to negotiate competitive
contract rates and disseminates the information to TPF Members for their use.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><u><strong>ISO 9002</strong></u></font><font SIZE="3"></p>

others are involved in the process. Members are encouraged to acquire ISO certification.</font>
