<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1990, five freight-forwarding firms located on the Pacific Rim
formed a central organization known as the Trans Pacific Freight (TPF) Group. The original
member companies sought to create a global network of freight forwarding business partners
supporting the independent freight forwarder.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1994, the membership reached twelve firms, which warranted opening
an administrative office led by an Executive Director. To meet growing demands, the office
of the Executive Director was established in Atlanta, Georgia in 1995. By that time,
membership had grown to twenty-one firms located in Asia, Europe, North America, South
America and Africa. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the group expanded the name was adjusted from Trans Pacific Freight
to TPF Forwarding Network to better reflect the global composition of the group&#146;s
membership. In order to formalize the organization, TPF incorporated in the State of
California.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On January 1, 1996, TPF contracted with International Association
Services, Inc. in Los Angeles to assume administrative responsibility. Upgrading the
administrative operations has enabled TPF to expand the membership services by stimulating
creative planning, developing marketing strategies, utilizing trade statistics and
informational resources, and pursuing the employment of outside professional support
services like public relations and advertising firms.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TPF Association, Inc. is a California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit
Corporation designed to promote the interests of the independent freight forwarding
industry. TPF&#146;s current membership consists of 30 member firms covering 54 ports of
entry with many new members under consideration.</p>
