<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TPF Forwarding Network is a worldwide association of independent
freight forwarders who have joined together in a strategic alliance to effectively compete
in today&#146;s global marketplace. To meet international shipping needs, TPF offers an
extensive network of member offices each bringing their commitment to service and home
market strength to the customer.</p>

no more than two from the same TPF geographic region of the world. The Board is elected by
the membership and is equally distributed among Europe/ Africa, the Americas and
Australia/Asia. Officers are elected to serve as President, Secretary and Treasurer. The
Board guides the TPF organization in addressing the key issues facing independent freight
forwarders and develops support services to enable the independent forwarder to
effectively compete in the industry. TPF relies on the active involvement of members to
create programs that meet the needs of TPF's diverse mix of members. TPF establishes
project work groups to develop and research new service ideas in order to advise directors
on the best options available for a specific project. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the projects designed to meet the group&#146;s objective, TPF is
currently undertaking the following activities:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Recruiting new members to expand the global representation of
    independent forwarders by the implementation of a new dues structure and two member
    development incentive programs.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. Implementing the TPF Information/Shipment Tracking System</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. Expanding the TPF bill of lading and insurance program</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. Negotiating favorable service contracts with steamship lines</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. Pooling resources to increase buying power</p>
