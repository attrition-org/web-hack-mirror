<p ALIGN="CENTER">TPF Forwarding Network Launches Bill of Lading Program</p>
</font><font SIZE="3">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE &#150; February 1999 &#150; The TPF Forwarding
Network announces the launch of the TPF Bill of Lading Program. Effective March 15, 1999,
TPF will make a central bill of lading available to qualified TPF member companies. After
extensive research and development, TPF has produced a program to strengthen the strong
global ties among TPF Members.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TPF&#146;s key objective is to develop programs that globally link
independent freight movement businesses while allowing such businesses to maintain their
local market strength. The TPF Bill of Lading Program is another service designed to link
independent member companies under a single organization. Use of the central TPF Bill of
Lading will help to identify locally based TPF Member companies as part of an extensive
global network. TPF Members that issue a TPF Bill of Lading illustrate to customers their
network affiliation.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Member participation in the TPF Bill of Lading Program augments
services offered by the individual member. For some members, this program enables them to
offer NVOCC service that they did not previously offer. For those members managing
significant NVOCC service, the TPF Bill of Lading raises the exposure of the TPF name,
increases the value of TPF affiliation and opens new opportunities for joint business
development among TPF members.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TPF Members work to strengthen their global link and are committed to
providing high quality service throughout the world. Members of the TPF Forwarding Network
utilize network resources to provide their customers the superior service of a regionally
based firm combined with the global reach on an international network.</p>

insurance available to member users of the TPF BL</font>
