law!!!" theres also another differnce between us and you bl0wfly

GET the
women while you sit on your fat arse's re-defaceing!! also "coz you dont
code your own shit" thats right i leave that to you geeks hunched over
your keyboards with fucked up back pains while i'm out getting blind
drunk and scoring pussy. who owns who now? h0h0h0h0 </font>
