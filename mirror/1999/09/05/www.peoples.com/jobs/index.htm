At People's, we're proud to call Connecticut home. As the largest independent financial institution in the state, we think locally, but act globally. People's is a leading financial institution which has been serving customers since 1842.
<p>
Our aim is to be a 21st century financial services company with a bank charter. As we work to achieve this, we know that services are paramount. To realize our goal, we are recruiting a diverse workforce, investing in leadership, encouraging innovation and embracing change. Our focus on people is the difference. This commitment has made us the institution we are today. It's our foundation. And our future.<p>

<h3>WE'RE NOT LIKE ANY OTHER COMPANY.</h3>At 
People's, our employees tell us we're small enough to provide personal mentoring and large enough to create an atmosphere that's diverse and challenging.  They're empowered to develop ideas and run with them.  We're also committed to workforce diversity. We recently received the Corporate Plus Award from Inroads, a national organization whose mission is to encourage development of high-potential minority students for career corporate success.

<h3>UP FRONT TUITION, LOTS OF BENEFITS.</h3>We're not like any other company, we're a learning institution. <i>We offer an Employee Scholarship Program that pays for tuition, books and fees for graduate and undergraduate degrees up front, plus gives a generous gift of People's Bank stock upon graduation.</i> We're one of three corporations in the nation that does this, a significance recognized on CNBC-TV  as well as page one of The Wall Street Journal. We also provide on-the-job training that includes leadership and professional development and a comprehensive list of on-site and off-site career courses geared to develop financial literacy, management competencies and technology skills.
<p>
	We're not like any other company. We know that working in this rapidly changing environment requires everything to be in "real time". So we offer flexible work schedules, telecommuting and goal-oriented incentive programs that reward employees for hard work and good ideas. There's more. We're one of the few companies today to offer a 5 percent dollar-for-dollar match on 401(k) contributions. We also provide a comprehensive menu of benefits options, including health and medical plans, dental, disability and emergency child and elder care. Supplemental health offerings include Weight Watchers At Work Program,® aerobics, fitness and prenatal classes, ballroom dancing and even Tai-Chi. Our benefits package, "work life" options and career advancement programs have made us one of the top 100 workplaces in the U.S., as rated by <i>Computer World</i>.

To us, community involvement means participation in literacy programs, improvement of children's education, creation of housing opportunities, service on boards and commissions, support of the arts and United Way giving. We know that our strength, the success of our customers and employees, depends on the well-being of our communities. You can make a difference here.

<h3>INTERVIEWING WITH PEOPLE'S BANK</h3>

      <P>   

Candidates will be contacted by a Recruiting Specialist if: Upon review of your  resume (or application) we determine that you appear to possess the minimum qualifications for a position, you may be contacted for an initial telephone interview. If it is determined  that you have the skills and qualifications we seek, an interview will be scheduled. If that interview confirms  you are qualified and interested in the position in question, additional interviews may be scheduled. We will provide you with an opportunity to learn a great deal about our organization and our people. The selection process for  
candidates can take two to four weeks, but you will be  notified of your status regardless. As you proceed through
the selection process you will be made aware that, consistent with People's Bank commitment to a  drug-free working environment and our emphasis on honesty and integrity of our staff, all job offers are contingent upon successfully passing a drug screening test and a satisfactory background investigation which includes a fingerprint check. People's Bank and its subsidiaries are equal opportunity employers. 

<p><h3>HOW WE INTERVIEW</h3>

<p>Our behavioral-based interview format is built on 
      the premise that past behavior is the best predictor of future job 
      performance. Therefore, it is a structured format to draw out your past 
      experiences in each of the core competency skills necessary to succeed at 
      People's Bank. We want to hear specific examples about times when you 
      have demonstrated the use of these skills. We are trying to learn more 
      about you than your GPA, SAT scores, or academic performance. We are 
      interested in what you can do and what experiences have prepared you to be 
      successful at People's Bank.</p>
