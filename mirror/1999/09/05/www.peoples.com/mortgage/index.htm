<P>Whatever your reason for buying a home, you have probably discovered that it is not a simple process.  Even if you have a good job and pay all of your bills on time, you might wonder if you can take on the extra financial responsibility of making a mortgage payment, furnishing your home and making repairs.</P>
<P>We can help.  People's Bank gives you the opportunity to purchase almost any single-family home with as little as a five percent down payment and, in some cases, a three percent down payment with the assistance of a family member or employer.  In addition, you can choose from a 15- or 30-year <B>Fixed Rate Mortgage</B> with generous qualifying guidelines.  People's also allows you to choose your method of payment.  You can select regular billing, pay-by-phone or automatic checking account deduction when paying your monthly mortgage bill.</P>
<P>Most importantly, People's Bank has FREE Buyer Education Course for <B>First Time Home Buyers</B>.  In just a few short hours, in the comfort of your own home and at your own pace, you will become familiar with many important aspects of home ownership through the <B>Dollars and Sense Guide to Home Ownership</B>.  Successful completion of the Buyer Education Course and the Guide Workbook is required of all borrowers purchasing homes utilizing the Affordable Housing Products.</P>
