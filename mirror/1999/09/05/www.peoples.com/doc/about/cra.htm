<p align=center>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Fair Lending Policy Statement And Fair Housing Policy Statement</b><br>It is the policy of People's Bank to comply with the letter and the spirit of the fair lending laws, including the Fair Housing Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Community Reinvestment Act, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. People's Bank's Fair Housing Policy Statement expresses our commitment to promote fair housing choice and, in making available residential real estate transactions, not to discriminate against any person on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, marital status, age, lawful source of income, family status, learning disability, physical or mental disability, or sexual orientation.</p><p><hr align=left></p><p><a name="anchor10697799"></a><b>Distribution of Banking Services</b><br>People's Bank provides a broad range of consumer banking services, individual and business credit products, residential mortgages and construction loans
to meet the changing needs of our diverse marketplace, including low-income neighborhoods. People's Bank has 128 branches, 84 <a href="../branch.htm">traditional branches</a> and 44 branches located in <a href="/doc/super.htm">supermarkets</a>. Most of these branches have weekend and extended business weekday hours to accommodate customers who cannot bank during traditional banking hours. Bank personnel are available at all offices to explain the types of credit that we offer, interview loan applicants, provide assistance in completing loan applications and counsel loan applicants. Bilingual employees are available to assist customers at our urban branch locations.</p>
<p>People's offers a full range of <a href="/call/index.htm">telephone banking services</a>, allowing customers the convenience and control of their finances from home, office, out of town, 24 hours a day, and seven days a week. Customers can transfer funds between accounts, get up-to-the minute-account balances, find out if a check has cleared, obtain access to a complete account history, and even pay many bills with a single call from any touch-tone telephone.</p>
<p>Customers also may bank via the Internet any time of day, no matter where they are. People's Online - Internet Banking and Internet Trading -  gives customers access to their account information, enabling them to manage banking and investments safely and securely via the Net.</p><p><hr align=left></p><p><a name="anchor10706829"></a><b><a href="../../mortgage/index.htm">Residential Lending</a></b><br>In addition to its many mortgage products, the residential lending department participates in federal and state programs that help low-and moderate-income households achieve the goal of home ownership. The department makes mortgage calling officers available to serve customers' diverse needs. The officers are available statewide, seven days a week to visit customers at home to take mortgage loan applications, a particularly convenient service for single-parent families and dual-career households. In addition, a sales support team provides training and seminars for banking personnel, real estate agents and the public.</p><p><hr align=left></p><p><a name="anchor10744800"></a><b><a href="../../commercial/index.htm">Small Business</a></b><br>People's Bank Community Lending Department enhances the bank's commitment to promote the Connecticut economy and support small businesses, including minority-and women-owned businesses, often in partnership with federal and state programs that help businesses to startup and expand. In 1995, People's Bank opened a Women's Business Center (WBC) designed specifically to aid women who want to start or expand a business. The center provides services ranging from initial counseling and training to loan financing. The WBC is the only one of its kind in the country and represents a partnership between a bank and a non-profit organization, the Entrepreneurial Center of the Hartford College for Women.</p><p>People's Bank has a People's Equity Business Line, a unique product designed to provide small businesses with a line of credit. The product is designed for companies in operation for at least one year and with borrowing needs between $10,000 and $250,000. Owners can obtain access to all or part of the credit line as they need to provide cash flow for the business.</p>
