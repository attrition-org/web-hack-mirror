<a name="over"><i><b>OVERVIEW</b></i></a><p>
People's Bank, in Bridgeport, is the largest independent bank in Connecticut. Its primary market is in Fairfield County, one of the nation's most affluent regions, where more than half of the households have a relationship with the bank. Statewide, in excess of 25 percent of households have relationships with People's. 

Founded in 1842 as a savings bank for middle class and blue collar workers, today People's is a multi-service financial institution with assets of more than $12 billion, more than 3,900 employees and a statewide network of 129 <a href="../branch.htm">branches</a>. The bank also offers 7-day-a-week service in 44 Super Stop & Shop stores. 
<p>
The bank offers diversified consumer and commercial financial services, as well as discount brokerage, asset management, insurance and leasing services through its subsidiaries, People's Securities, Inc., Olson Mobeck & Associates, Inc., and R.C. Knox and Company, Inc. and People's Capital & Leasing Corp., respectively.
<p>
People's is the No. 1 mortgage lender and top issuer of Savings Bank Life Insurance in the state. An international issuer of bank credit cards, People's ranks as the 19th largest issuer of Visa and MasterCard.
<p>
People's converted to a mutual holding company/public ownership on July 13, 1988. Initial stock price was $5.67 (split-adjusted). 
<P>
<h2><i>Position in Industry</i></h2>
<P>
People's is recognized in the industry as a leader in service
to its constituencies and as an innovator in banking concepts. In
1974, for example, People's was the first financial institution
in the nation to offer bill-paying by telephone. Today, telephone
banking is an integral part of People's customer service. More
than 2 million calls are processed through the People's Plus Center every month.
<P>
Similarly, People's was the first bank in the region
to open supermarket branches, offering convenient full-service
banking directly to its customers, seven days a week.
<P>
Mergers, consolidations and regional banking have shifted the
makeup of  New England's financial industry. Today People's competes with large regional banking operations and succeeds in meeting the banking needs of Connecticut consumers and commercial banking customers.  People's also succeeds in having a significant impact on the communities it serves as a leader in community lending projects and as a major
employer.

<B>DAVID E.A. CARSON</B>
<P><img align="left" src="/image/about/carson.gif" width=180 height=270 border=0 alt="David E. A. Carson">
Chief executive officer of People's Bank,  David E. A. Carson
is viewed as a leader, a challenger, a person who effects needed
change. He is involved in many Connecticut civic, community and
cultural endeavors. And People's Bank, the multi-service financial
institution he heads, is recognized for its commitment not only
to the financial needs of its publics, but to the broader spectrum
of community life, public education and the arts. 
<P>
Formerly the CEO of Middlesex Mutual Assurance, a property and
casualty insurance company in Middletown, Conn., Carson joined
People's in 1983. He is now CEO and trustee of People's
Mutual Holdings and chairman and CEO of People's
Bank, which has managed assets of more than $12 billion.
<P>
Carson is an immediate past chairman of America's Community Bankers and
regularly adds his support on key bank industry legislative issues.
He also is a director of the United Illuminating Company and American
Skandia Trust. And he is a member of the Thrift Institutions Advisory
Council, Federal Reserve System and of the Senior Advisory Council,
The New England Banking Institute.
<P>
Public education is both a corporate and personal commitment.
Carson is a trustee and former chairman of the board of Connecticut
Public Broadcasting and past chairman of the Connecticut Business
and Industry Association. He is also chairman of the Business
Advisory Committee, Connecticut Commission on Children. He is
the former chairman, Board of Trustees, Hartford Seminary. In
the bank's headquarters city, Carson is chairman of the Bridgeport
Public Education Fund, a founder of the Bridgeport Futures Initiative
and trustee of a new state-of-the-art public magnet school in
Bridgeport. The magnet school is part of a statewide demonstration
to show how business can assist and support educational change.
<P>
People's Bank is a significant financial contributor to educational
programs in Bridgeport and the state. The bank provides major
support for educational programs on Connecticut Public Television.
People's also funds an art and education series for children each
year at the Bushnell (theater) and has been instrumental in bringing
the Hartford Ballet to Bridgeport. People's Bank has, for the
past ten years, sponsored and funded a calendar that features
the artwork of disabled adults who work at the Kennedy Center
in Bridgeport. The bank distributes the calendars at all its branches
and hosts an annual reception where the original art is sold.
<P>
&quot;A bank that makes a real commitment to a community can't
do that with just bricks and mortar, but with what affects the
lives of its people,&quot; says Carson. A strong supporter of
&quot;in kind&quot; donations, he
<P>
has performed roles in several Connecticut Ballet Theater productions
in Stamford and New York. He has furled sails from the highest
yardarm of Bridgeport's famous HMS <I>Rose</I> and hugged boa
constrictors at the Beardsley Zoo. He regularly reads to schoolchildren
and is equally at home giving ecumenical sermons at local churches.
<P>
As a former insurance executive and actuary, Carson places tremendous
focus on numbers and analysis, but he is also known as the catalyst
for the vision that has taken People's Bank into a highly competitive
position in Connecticut and beyond. 
<P>
Founded in 1842 as a mutual savings bank and converted to stock
form in 1988, People's is now the largest independent bank in
Connecticut.  People's offers a wide range of  banking, fiduciary
and financial services to corporate, individual and municipal
customers. And in the highly competitive banking market of the
1990s, People's is widely recognized for its innovative concepts,
including supermarket banking, PC banking and various online and
video banking services.  People's also is a top 20 issuer nationally
of Visa and MasterCard. 
<P>
Born in Birkenhead, England, Carson grew up in New York. He is
a graduate of the University of Michigan, School of Business Administration and received a Doctor of Laws Degree (honoris causa) from the University of New Haven and honorary degrees from the University of Bridgeport and Sacred Heart University.
<P>
In 1996, Carson was asked to give the commencement address at
two city universities. His messages at both these schools reflect
his thought process. At the University of Bridgeport, Carson spoke
of pride in graduating from a university in a city like Bridgeport
with a rich heritage and a strong future. At Sacred Heart University
in Fairfield, Carson's speech, &quot;Days of Joy,&quot; focused
on treasuring the experiences that really matter in life. And
for this banking CEO, these experiences clearly extend beyond
the executive office into the heart and soul of his community.
