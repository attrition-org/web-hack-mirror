Schedules</a> </p>
<B><P>BRIDGEPORT, CT</B> -- People's Bank (NASDAQ: PBCT) today 
announced net income of $29.0 million or $0.47 per share for the quarter ended 
June 30, 1999, up four percent on a per share basis compared to $28.7 million or 
$0.45 per share for the second quarter of 1998. Earnings per share increased 18 
percent compared to the second quarter of 1998 excluding a $5.3 million ($0.05 
per share) non-recurring gain on the sale of $107 million in credit card 
balances in the 1998 quarter.</P>

<P>David E. A. Carson, chairman and chief executive officer, stated, &quot;We are pleased to report 13 percent growth in managed operating revenues, demonstrating the continued strength of our core operating results. This strong revenue growth was driven by a 17 percent increase in managed net interest income and a 13 percent increase in managed fee-based revenues.&quot; </P>

<P>John A. Klein, president, noted, &quot;Our Commercial Banking division generated strong growth, with average commercial loans up 15 percent and average commercial real estate loans up 10 percent compared to the second quarter of 1998. These results reflect the strength of our franchise in Connecticut, particularly our continued focus on building and expanding customer relationships. We were also pleased with double-digit growth in average commercial and consumer checking deposits, reflecting the continued success of our Stop &amp; Shop supermarket banking program.&quot; </P>

<P>Results for the second quarter also reflect a $1.2 billion or 11 percent increase in average managed assets, led by growth of $733 million or nine percent in average managed loans.  The loan growth was led by an increase of $527 million or 16 percent in average managed credit card receivables, including strong contributions from the U.K.  </P>

<P>Additionally, People&rsquo;s announced an expansion of its U.K. credit card operation. Having achieved profitability in late 1998, the business is entering its next phase by adding a &quot;relationship call center&quot; which will triple staffing to 150 people. This move will bring the collections process in house and enhance the overall ability to manage customer relationships. </P>

<P>George W. Morriss, executive vice president and chief financial officer, also noted, &quot;We recently announced the completion of our first stock repurchase program initiated in November 1998, repurchasing 3.2 million shares in the open market at an average price of $29.30 per share. The swift and successful completion of this program demonstrates our continued commitment to providing fundamental value for our shareholders,&quot; said Morriss. </P>

<P>People&rsquo;s Board of Directors declared a $0.26 quarterly dividend on its common stock, payable August 15, 1999, to stockholders of record on August 1, 1999. People's Mutual Holdings, which owns 36.5 million shares of People's Bank common stock, will accept $275,000 in dividends, representing payment on only<B> </B>three percent of its shares. </P>

<P>Regarding its Year 2000 project, People&rsquo;s said it has met all FDIC target dates in compliance with FDIC guidelines.  The bank has completed testing of all its mission-critical systems and all of those systems are now operating in production. This means the systems that support savings, checking, teller transactions, ATMs, telephone banking, PC/Internet banking, PC/Internet trading and credit cards are all Year 2000 ready. </P>

<P>For the first half of 1999, net income totaled $56.9 million or $0.91 per share compared to $54.1 million or $0.85 per share for the 1998 period. </P>

<P>The largest bank headquartered in Connecticut, People&rsquo;s Bank is a diversified financial services company providing consumer, commercial, insurance and investment services.
