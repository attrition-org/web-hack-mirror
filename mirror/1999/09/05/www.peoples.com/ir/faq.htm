<h3>Why do you have a mutual holding company structure?
 Are there any plans to fully convert the remaining shares of
People's Bank stock?</h3>
<P>
People's Mutual Holdings (&quot;Holdings&quot;) was
created in 1988 when we converted from a mutual savings bank to
a stock savings bank, holding 78 percent of the shares initially
issued.  We used this structure because it allowed incremental
access to capital and it helped preserve the bank's independence
and community focus.  Holdings currently owns 57 percent of all
outstanding People's shares.  The Board of Directors of People's
Bank and the Board of Trustees of Holdings have each indicated
their intention to retain the mutual holding company structure.

<P>
This structure has served all of our constituents
well.  Our customers and communities have benefited from having
a stable, Connecticut-focused bank that makes decisions on a local
level and isn't at risk of being taken over by a large, unfriendly
out-of-state bank.  Our shareholders have benefited from the longer-term
view this structure affords People's in developing strategic plans.
 Additionally, Holdings' practice of waiving dividends on all
but three percent of its shares has generated substantial capital
to support the strong growth in our asset base.  This allows People's
to pay an attractive dividend to stockholders, while retaining
a higher proportion of earnings than is typical of most banks.
<p>
<h3>Is the bank prepared for the Year 2000 computer
problem?</h3>
<p>
People's Bank has had a project team dedicated to this problem since
1996. Using a team approach, People's created an Executive Steering
Committee and a bank-wide project team with project managers and
representatives from all business areas of the bank. Although no
organization can guarantee it will have no problems, we are following
FDIC guidelines and working with the recommended five-phase plan:
awareness, assessment, renovation, validation and implementation. All
our mission-critical systems are Year 2000 ready and in use today. We
have also contacted our vendors, suppliers and customers to ensure they
will be ready for the Year 2000. See our <a href="/y2k/y2k9798.htm">quarterly SEC filing</a> for a full
discussion of People's Year 2000 efforts or visit the <a href="../y2k/index.htm">Year 2000 section</a>
of our website.




<P>
<B><h3>Since your Stop &amp; Shop initiative has been
so successful in generating deposits, are there any plans to open
similar branches in other states?  Are the branches generating
any assets?</h3>
</B>
<P>
The supermarket branches are performing exceptionally
well.  Our initial goal was to build $1 billion in deposits by
the Year 2000.  We are on track to reach that goal in early 1999
- ahead of schedule.  Our average supermarket branch size of $22
million in deposits at the end of 1998 compares very favorably
with the experiences of other banks - more than four times the
average level for supermarket branches open between three and
five years.

<P>
Three years into this initiative, customers appear
to be comfortable with the idea of doing more of their banking
in a supermarket.  During 1998, we originated $75 million in residential
mortgage loans in our supermarket branches through People's Bankers
and interactive video.

<P>
With the primary goal of building deposit relationships,
we would definitely be interested in exporting our formula outside
of Connecticut should the right opportunity arise.


<P>
<B><h3>How did the flattened yield curve affect your
business in 1998, and what impact will it have in 1999?  How do
you protect yourself against interest rate risk?</h3>
</B>
<P>
When long-term interest rates drop to the point that
they are roughly the same as short-term interest rates, this &quot;flat
yield curve&quot; environment has a negative effect on all banks,
since much of the banking business is interest-rate related. 
Since People's business mix is more diversified than most banks
our size, our financial results are less volatile as interest
rates fluctuate.  Although we feel earnings pressure from a flat
yield curve, our focus on fee-based businesses, such as insurance
and investment management, helps make our earnings less dependent
on interest rate-related activities.

<P>
Additionally, we have an active asset/liability committee
that meets twice a month to review and set strategy in light of
market changes.  The goal of this committee is to balance our
portfolios to minimize the impact of movements in interest rates
on our overall profitability.  Over the last five years, our net
interest margin has been extremely stable through many different
types of interest rate cycles.


<P>
<B><h3>What is the significance of the stock repurchase
program announced by People's?</h3>
</B>
<P>
In November 1998, People's announced a program to
repurchase up to five percent of the total shares outstanding,
or 3.2 million shares.  Stock repurchase programs are a commonly
used tool for public companies.  They represent an efficient way
to provide value to shareholders, manage capital resources and
take advantage of market conditions.  Reducing the number of shares
outstanding is expected to have a positive effect on earnings
per share and return on equity.


<P>
<B><h3>Why did People's Bank enter into a strategic alliance
with HomeSide?</h3>
</B>
<P>
The nature of the mortgage servicing business has
evolved to the point where a very large-scale operation is needed
to maximize efficiency.  As a result, there has been a continued
shift in this industry with many small and large banks deciding
to turn this operation over to large companies specializing in
this area.

<P>
For People's Bank, this was a strategic decision,
as we felt the business required more scale than would be profitable
for us to maintain.  Another issue is the risk associated with
managing a growing mortgage servicing asset, with the potential
for significant write-downs should mortgage prepayment rates accelerate.


<P>
For these reasons, we entered into a strategic alliance
with HomeSide Lending, Inc., a subsidiary of National Australia
Bank, whereby HomeSide will assume responsibility for billing
and payment processing for all of People's residential mortgages.
 This alliance will allow us to focus on what we do best - originating,
approving and closing residential mortgage loans.  As the No.
1 mortgage lender in Connecticut, making mortgages is a key part
of our consumer banking heritage.
