<a name="LISBLI"></a>
<P><B>SBLI</B></p><P>Savings Bank Life Insurance, or SBLI, was founded in 1942 and has maintained
one of the highest ratings attainable from the industry's leading independent
authority, A.M. Best. Through savings banks like People's, SBLI offers a
wide range of low-cost Term and Whole Life plans, as well as tax-deferred
annuities. High in quality and low in cost, SBLI's policies can meet your
protection needs for today and cash accumulation needs for tomorrow.</P>
<a name="LIDEP"></a>
<P><B>Affordable Term Life Insurance Coverage</B></p><p>
Term insurance is low-cost, pure insurance which is automatically renewed
periodically and ends at age 70. You pay only for the life insurance protection
you need. <A HREF="#LIMI">Need more information?</A></P>

<P><B>Low-Cost Depositor's Group Term Life Insurance</B></p><p>
Now you can provide the extra protection you want for your family but thought
you couldn't afford.  If you're a People's Bank customer between the ages
of 15 and 60, you may apply for  $15,000 to $300,000 of Depositor's Group
Life coverage, which offers the lowest-cost coverage available from SBLI.  <A HREF="#LIMI">Need more information?</A></P>

<P>Unlike other term policies, Depositor's Group automatically includes
a waiver of premium provision which will pay your premium should you become
disabled and cannot work.  Plus, you have the option to convert your Term
policy to SBLI permanent Whole Life and begin building tax-deferred cash
value and dividends which can be used for any purpose. <A HREF="#LIMI">Need more information?</A></P>

<P><font size=1><b><i>* Rates for non-tobacco users showing evidence of good health. Other rates also available.  Rates increase every 5 years beginning at age 30. Available up to $300,000.</i></b></font><p>
</P>
<a name="LICT"></a>
<p>
<B>Single Premium Children's Term</B></p><p>
For a one-time premium as low as $80, you can start building a secure future
for your children or grandchildren.  From 15 days to 15 years old, any child
is eligible to apply, and once the policy is approved, it will protect the
child up to age 22.  At age 22, the child is guaranteed to convert their
policy to any SBLI policy for up to five times the original amount. That
could mean up to $50,000 of life insurance with no health questions to answer,
at an age when premiums are still low. <A HREF="#LIMI">Need more information?</A></P>
<img src="/image/services/lifeins/childter.gif" width="331" height="97" alt="Children's Term"><br>
<font size=1><i><b>*Death benefit is 1/2 before child's fifth birthday.</b></i></p></font>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<a name="LIWL"></a>
<P><B>Enjoy the Lifetime Benefits of Whole Life Coverage</B></p><p>
Whole Life is permanent insurance, available in amounts up to $300,000.  Anyone age 15 days to age 70 (Straight Life) may apply.  Though the premium is higher than Term, your premium remains level and does not increase with age. Your coverage continues for life and earns cash
value and dividends which can be used for any purpose such as retirement,
education, etc. <A HREF="#LIMI">Need more information?</A></P>

<font size=1><i><b>* Rates shown for non-tobacco users in good health.  Other rates also available. </b></i></font><p>
<P><B>Straight Whole Life </B></p><p>

Straight Life is low cost, permanent insurance for those individuals who
believe they'll need life insurance for many years to come.  Over time,
Straight Life, with its tax-deferred cash value build-up and dividends,
can be very economical for those with long-term insurance needs.</P>

<P>You decide how much coverage you need and what you can afford. Your death
benefit will never decrease and your premium will never increase. The premium
you pay in the first year is the same you pay during the entire period of
coverage. <A HREF="#LIMI">Need more information?</A></P>

<P><B>Single Premium Whole Life</B></p><p>
SBLI's Single Premium Whole Life allows you to purchase the insurance you
need with one single premium payment. You'll be insured for life and have
accumulating cash value and dividends while providing your family with the
added security they need. <A HREF="#LIMI">Need more information?</A></P>

<P><B>20 Payment Whole Life</B></p><p>
This plan provides the same permanent protection as Straight Life, but you
pay a fixed premium for only 20 years.  After that, the policy is paid up
and coverage will continue without additional premiums. Your premiums are
slightly higher because of the shorter payment schedule, but you save money
overall because you make premium payments for fewer years and build cash
value faster. <A HREF="#LIMI">Need more information?</A></P>

<P><B>Whole Life Paid Up at Age 65</B></p><p>
An economical way to complete your premium payments before retirement, this
plan builds a nest egg for you and your family while assuring you protection
throughout your lifetime.  You pay level premiums that end when you turn
65, but your coverage and cash values will continue for the rest of your
life. <A HREF="#LIMI">Need more information?</A></P>
<a name="LIGG"></a>
<P><B>Guaranteed Golden</B></p><p>
Guaranteed Golden is an outstanding value with low, affordable rates. Forget
about physical exams or lengthy questionnaires. We guarantee that we won't
turn you down. That's a promise. You automatically qualify if you're a female
between the ages of 55 and 75 or a male 55 to 72. The premium you pay will
never go up and the value of your insurance will never go down.  Plus, you
build cash value at the same time. </P>
<P>You can buy it to restore the value of your existing insurance eaten
away by inflation, or to give as a gift to someone you love, or more practically,
to help pay final bills and tax expenses.  As long as you pay your premiums,
Guaranteed Golden will protect you for life. Our policy provides more coverage
for your premium dollar than others on the market.  <A HREF="#LIMI">Need more information?</A></P>

<P><B>Mortgage Life Insurance</B></p><p>
Now you can cover your mortgage with Term life insurance up to $300,000
and the premium will be conveniently included in your monthly mortgage payment.
Your premiums will not increase with age.  And, unlike other plans which
end at age 70 or 75, SBLI's coverage continues until your loan is paid off.
Your entire mortgage balance can be covered up to $300,000 or you may request
coverage on 50% of your loan.  Homeowner with a People's Bank mortgage or mortgage application ages 18 to 59 may apply. <A HREF="#LIMI">Need more information?</A></P>

<P><B>Tax-Deferred Annuities</B></p><p>SBLI's Tax-Deferred Annuities allow you to put aside cash for your retirement
and pay no income tax on the interest you earn until the funds are withdrawn.
 SBLI offers you the choice of either a flexible savings plan or single
premium savings plan.</P>

<P>The TaxSaver I Annuity is our flexible premium savings plan.  You may open your account with as little as $5,000 and each year on the anniversary date of your Annuity you can add $1,000 or up to a total combined amount of $500,000 per Annuitant in principal for SBLI Annuities. Each year you'll receive a new competitive interest rate. Your money accumulates interest on a tax-deferred basis, and there are no administrative fees to erode your account value.  In later years, it provides a secure lifetime
income you cannot outlive.</P>

<P>SBLI's TaxSaver II Annuity is a single premium savings plan. You may
open your account with as little as $10,000.  Your competitive interest
rate is fixed for two years with a new rate declared on your policy anniversary
every two years thereafter.  Like TaxSaver I, there are no administrative
fees and your money accumulates interest on a tax-deferred basis. TaxSaver
II can also accept a rollover or transfer from your existing IRA, 401(k)
or qualified retirement plan. <A HREF="#LIMI">Need more information?</A>

nor guaranteed by, any federally insured bank.</FONT></B>
