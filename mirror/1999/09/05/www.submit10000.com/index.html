<center>"From the Sin"</center>
<br>
well the hell has fucked us up with a betrayal of trust,<br>
now sell all your health but keep your wealth if you must.<br>
tried so hard to live in an illusion of democracy,<br>
died to the farside, everything destroyed in the prophecies.<br>
we raced to get power, but we never had it.<br>
we slaved and saved lives by buyin lives with our automatics.<br>
but nothin is right but the lie that we thought we won,<br>
everything fucked, and everything gone.<br>
so hold your breath and sink your teeth in your skin,<br>
coz everythings fucked and gone from within.
<br>
<br>
chorus: 
its all screwed up from within (within)<br>
its all screwed up from the sin.<br>
when the good guy dies, and the evil wins.<br>
its all screwed up from the sin. (from the sin)
<br>
<br>
when i was young, i played songs on my doorbell,<br>
i never sung but listened to stories it'd tell.<br>
livin life in a poor man's comic strip<br>
just grip a bullet and refill your clip.<br>
ninety-nine percent of life is pain,<br>
so i redefine mine and erase my name. (its all the same)<br>
and everything is always for the worse,<br>
throwin' lyric after lyric & verse after verse,<br>
don't needta rehearse, so i curse the universe,<br> 
and i leave it at that because we'll never win,<br>
coz everythings fucked and gone from within.<br>
<br>
(chorus)
<br>
stuck in a hole, the world digs it in deep<br>
dirt covers your walls and in the coffin you sleep.<br>  
wake up, get up and get back on your feet,<br>
fight a war for the power, so sour, so sweet.<br>
you know silent nights are only a dream,<br>
when violent fights are the seed to why the children scream.<br>
we can't sign the declaration if we are dead men,<br>
thats why everything is fucked and gone from within.<br>
(chorus)
