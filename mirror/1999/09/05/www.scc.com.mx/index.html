<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong><u>&quot;b4sically,
any0ne whoze life revolvez ar0und seeing the1r n4me on
attrition.org/mirror&quot;</u></strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Come again? Are you
saying that your &quot;name&quot; is not on attrition?</strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="6">&quot;un1x b0wl1ng t34m&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="6">Um, I dont think I need glasses
to see that your &quot;group&quot; is also mirrored on
attrition...And it DOES NOT happen BY ACCIDENT.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">You just dont make sense. If you
diss those people who are mirrored, then why are you also getting
your shit mirrored? I just cant understand this.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>b4sically, you need to
shut the fuck up and get a life.</strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="6">Just stop it. Its enough. I dont
know who the &quot;b0wlers&quot; are, but Im guessing
&quot;they&quot; are your alter ego's.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">Hey, pretending to have friends
is just as bad as dissing someone for no reason. Throwing shit at
someone out of the blue is not smart.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">Enough talk.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">Just one last thing. Are you
saying that everyone who had or has &quot;the1r n4me on
attrition.org/mirror&quot; is doing it just for attrition? Are
you saying thats the only reason people deface?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="6">Man, you started this shit for <strong><u>no</u></strong><strong>
reason</strong>. And you still have <strong><u>no</u></strong><strong>
reason</strong>. Why are you talking shit? It doesnt, and wont,
get you anywhere.</font></p>

TO YOU.</u></font></p>
