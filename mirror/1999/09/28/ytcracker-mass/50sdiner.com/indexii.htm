Every now and then you run across a place to eat, a special place, that satisfies
everything you're looking for in a restaurant. The atmosphere is comfortable
and fun. The food is down-right terrific. And there isn't a price on the
entire menu in the double digits!
<P>
The Fifty's Diner in Sarasota is just such a restaurant. It's so unique and
enjoyable, that once you and your family have eaten there, you'll return
again and again. When it's time to dine out, the first place you'll think
of is The Fifty's Diner.
<P>
Conveniently located at 3737 Bahia Vista Street, east of Beneva Road (off
Fruitville Road, Exit 39). The Fifty's Diner is owned and operated by Milton
Yoder and his wife, Carol. To make it truly a family affair, their daughter
Renee works as their bookkeeper and their other two daughters, Tonya and
Susan, wait tables part-time.
<P>
Upon entering The Fifty's Diner you see the interior was designed as a
remembrance of the past, with <A HREF="memo.htm">fun memorabilia </A>from
the 50s adorning the walls. Like a 10-foot high collage of history, every
wall is filled with nostalgic photos, road signs, Coca-Cola signs, neon signs
and <A HREF="corvette.htm">replica rear bumpers from old Corvettes</A>. Unlike
other restaurant franchises who display items on their walls, The Fifty's
Diner sells most of the 50s items on their walls. Additional items are available
through their <A HREF="giftshop.htm">very own gift shop!</A>
<P>
Patrons are seated at red and white vinyl booths, tables and chairs set atop
black and white, old-fashioned tile floors that extend to a traditional soda
fountain. And on each table is a "Pages of Time" nostalgic news report available
for purchase. Select any date from 1900 to 1992 and take it home with you.
<P>
Described by most patrons as an "informal 1950s style family diner," the
menu items at The Fifty's Diner take you back to home cooked meals, made
fresh like Mom used to make. From sandwiches to blue plate specials, each
portion is large...a heaping helping that's sure to leave you full.
<P>
It seems an understatement to say that this diner has a wide variety of menu
items when you see the amount of choices The Fifty's Diner has to offer.
These items include salads, soups, appetizers, full dinners, blue plate platters,
sandwiches, pasta, burgers, 15 side dishes and over 20 different desserts.
<P>
And when was the last time you had a beverage choice that included a "real"
ice cream soda, or cherry, chocolate or vanilla coke?
<P>
One menu heading that is always a favorite is <A HREF="platters.htm">The
Fifty's Diner Blue Plate Platters</A>. Favorites include meatloaf, pot roast,
roast pork or liver and onions, all tender enough to cut with a fork, each
includes your choice of two side dishes. One especially popular blue plate
platter is called the Manhattans, a piping hot sandwich with your choice
of meatloaf, pot roast, or roast turkey, topped with real mashed potatoes
and thick, creamy gravy.
<P>
If you're in the mood for a <A HREF="hamb.htm">burger</A>, try their 50s'
style burger, 100% beef served on a kaiser roll with all the fixins. Or the
Hub Cap burger, covered with Swiss cheese, sauteed onions, American cheese,
bacon AND chili. Bet you haven't tasted a burger this good before!
<P>
The <A HREF="platters.htm#SD">side dishes</A> just by themselves are a smart
reason to dine at The Fifty's Diner. Try the potato cakes with onions and
cheese - it will be every bit as tasty as your main entree! But don't try
to get the recipe from the kitchen - like a great magician, they never give
out the secret!
<P>
Other standard side dishes found at The Fifty's Diner that are hard to find
elsewhere are: applesauce, jello salad, potatoes O'Brien (another secret
recipe?), The Fifty's Diner's own special potato salad, or shrimp-pasta salad.
If these side dishes don't grab you, there are nine others to choose from.
<P>
Another entree category you'll have a hard time deciding on during your lunch
will be a <A HREF="platters.htm#DD">"Diner Dinner" </A>item, roast turkey.
The turkey is thickly sliced and moist, served with cornbread stuffing, cranberry
sauce and two side dishes. As is customary at The Fifty's Diner, this meal
is veeeeery filling!
<P>
But never too filling for a little <A HREF="platters.htm#OBG">dessert.</A>
The problem is: "Which of the vast assortment of yummy desserts should one
choose?" Well, try the jumbo brownie, a LARGE homemade chocolate brownie
topped with real vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, whipped cream and, of
course, a cherry. Another great choice would be a generous slice of homemade
cherry pie, with flaky crust oozing with filling. In addition to the unending
selection of desserts like bread pudding, carrot layer cake and a banana
split deluxe, The Fifty's Diner has all sorts of fresh fruit pies that are
made whenever they are in season.
<P>
Speaking of desserts, try the <A HREF="platters.htm#BP">root beer float </A>-
it looks delicious and is served in a 20 ounce soda glass made with Baskin
Robbins Ice Cream. All for only $2.25!
<P>
One other fun part of visiting The Fifty's Diner is the nostalgic "Kruz In"
classic car gatherings held every second and fourth Saturday of each month.
On these days beginning at 6 p.m., car buffs and their antique autos are
invited to park and socialize at The Fifty's Diner and receive a "free item
of the day" - usually a 32 oz. Coke. Drawings for prizes are given away and
are accompanied by good old-fashioned-outdoor-lawnchair-socializing. On a
good evening, fans at this event will not be surprised to see as many as
100 vintage vehicles.
<P>
The Fifty's Diner is open for lunch and dinner (the same menu!) from 11 a.m.
to 10 p.m., Monday through Saturday. Early bird specials are served from
3 to 5 p.m. A children's menu is available and no alcoholic beverages are
served.
<P>
No smoking is allowed and take-outs are available. Visa, Mastercard and Discover
are accepted. Telephone (941) 95DINER (953-4637).
<P>
A comment often heard at The Fifty's Diner is "I wish they had a Fifty's
Diner where we're from. We would go out to eat every night."
<P>
With that in mind, if you're looking for a nostalgic, enjoyable dining experience
