        <p align="left">The Baseball Warehouse is designed to
        provide our customer's with the best name brand
        equipment, apparel and other baseball and softball
        related items at competitive prices while maintaining the
        highest level of customer satisfaction possible.</p>
        <p align="left">Our customer's will find not only the
        core equipment (bats, gloves, etc.) but also hard to find
        items that normally aren't found in your typical sporting
        goods store (pitching machines, field maintenance items,
        bleachers, etc.). Only the highest quality merchandise
        can be found in the Baseball Warehouse 24 hours a day, 7
        days a week. Orders are easy to place with a major credit
        card through our 100% secure system. If any questions
        arise, please call our offices at 1-888-679-SHOP or
        502-495-2300.</p>
