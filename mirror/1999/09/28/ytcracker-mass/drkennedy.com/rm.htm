<p>Good News!!</b></font><font FACE="Memoir" SIZE="4"></p>

<p>On September 7<sup>th</sup>, Dr. Roman Malley joined me at LQMG Medical Group, Inc.</p>

<p>Dr. Malley received his medical degree in 1981 in Ukraine, and practiced Obstetrics and
Gynecology until 1989.</p>

<p>In 1989 he and his family relocated to the United States, becoming a US citizen in
1995.</p>

<p>This summer he completed a Residency in Internal Medicine at University Medical Center,
Fresno and now enters the private practice of Internal Medicine at LQMG.</p>

<p>Dr. Malley is also expert in the field of Geriatrics, Intensive Care and long-term
care.</p>

<p>Dr. Malley and I will be working every day, switching between morning and afternoon. If
one of us is away on other business, the other will be at LQMG to care for any of your
urgent or perhaps not so urgent needs.</p>

<p>Being new to private office practice, Dr. Malley is open for any new patients and would
welcome any referrals you may have from family and friends.</p>

<p>In addition to Dr. Malley, <b>Janel</b> has joined the team. She recently finished a
course of study in Medical Assisting and has completed an internship at LQMG, where she
impressed everybody with her attitude, knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to call.</font><font FACE="SawyersHand" SIZE="4"><b></p>
