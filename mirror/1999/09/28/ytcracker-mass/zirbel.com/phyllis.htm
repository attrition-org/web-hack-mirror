<p>Hi Tim <br>
<br>
I was given this info from a shop who deals in family crests<br>
And I Don't know what book he obtained it from as it was a computer<br>
printout in 1993<br>
<br>
Details are:<br>
Early refrences to the German family name Zirbel and it variants Zwirbel<br>
date back to the 13th century, where one Burkart der Zwirbeler was<br>
mentioned in documents for the year 1294.<br>
<br>
The surname Zirbel is of nickname origan, deriving fram a personal or<br>
physicial characteristic of the original bearer.&nbsp; Her, the surname Zirbel<br>
derives from the Middle high German&quot;zirben&quot;. 'zirbelen&quot;, meaning to whirl<br>
or turning in circles.<br>
<br>
The name indicates a person who is confused and unable to focus his<br>
thoughts or actions.. Nicknames were common in the Middle Ages and wer<br>
given to people indicating the colour of their hair, beard or eyes.<br>
Sometimes people received their nicknames after cerain events, that are<br>
long forgtton since that time.<br>
<br>
The nicknames became the hereditary name for generations to come. It is<br>
interesting to point out, that German surnames came into existence in the<br>
12th century, when the nobility used the name of their ancestral seat or<br>
the place from where they came from as their surname or family name. Later<br>
on the rest of the populatin followed using the name of their father, the<br>
occupation of their father of their own, or the name of the place from<br>
where they came from.<br>
<br>
The suirname Zirbel and its variants forms of Zwirbel, Zwirler, Zwirkel and<br>
Zwirbler can be found in documents dating back to the 13th century.<br>
The above mentioned Burkart der Zwirbeler was a resident, citizen and judge<br>
in the city of Vaihingen in the year 1294.&nbsp; Documents for the year 1332<br>
indicate one fritzo Zwirler resided on Vaihingen.&nbsp; one named Zwirggel &quot;mit<br>
der einen Hand&quot; with one hand was a resident of Augsburg in year 1350.<br>
Research did not indicate a coat of arms for a family named Zirbel.<br>
<br>
I really don't know how much of the information is right as I have not<br>
researched back that far. No real sure about the confused or unable to<br>
focus bit.<br>
<br>
I can only at this stage focus on my family research!<br>
<br>
All the best wishes<br>
