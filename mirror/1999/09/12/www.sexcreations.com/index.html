<b>some shit we need to discuss:</b><BR><BR>
<u>MOCKING</u>:<BR>
Ok, people that mock Level Seven loose respect from L7.. (eg, Hi-Tech Hate, Outlaws, ect)  We have uttermost respect for every hacking group, but cross the line, you will loose it.<BR><BR><BR>
<u>EMAIL TO MSNBC</u>:<BR>
Ok, now on the topic of the email to MSNBC.  First off, we did not mean it as a threat in any way, were not like that, its not our nature.  Second, in the <A HREF="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/1999/09/09/www.sexxi.com/">www.sexxi.com</A> hack, it was stated, "We dont do this for media attention", this wasnt true at the time.  One of the Level Seven members, wrote that up, and did that hack.  I (vent) did not write that.. and we were doing some big hacks for media attention at the time.  So as attrition so elegantly put it "Due to the message in this defacement, we felt posting 
this e-mail was necessary to show the irony of vent's words".. I didnt write it, and there was no irony in my words...<BR><BR>At the time of that hack, we were doing some sites for media attention, but if you read below it will explain the solution to all of this.<BR><BR>Thankyou,<BR><i>vent</i><BR><BR><BR>
<u>MEDIA</u>:<BR>
Ok, Level Seven has been discussing over the last 2 days, and we have sought it best not to disclose any more information to the media.  Being it's pointless, and will just gib us a higher risk of being raided.  So, from now on, we will not talk to the media about the hacks, they may write about us, but we will not go for interviews.<BR><BR>vent and foil discussed, and decided that the media attention was a bad idea, and they have made it clear to all members of Level Seven, not to divulge any more info about us, or our hacks to anyone.  We are now making it clear to the public, and to the media.. that communication with us, will be quite difficult, from this point on.<BR><BR>
Thankyou,<BR><i>The Level Seven Crew</i>

<BR><BR><BR>
<u>RACISM</u>:<BR>
To tell you the truth, we are not racist.  It was a mistake to put that shit up on the usembassy-china.gov hack, we have friends in the group that are chinese, and shit... it was ment as a joke, and wasnt supposed to be used as the actual html doc... we had made another one with no racism.. .we being stupid, thought it would be funny to the chinese members in L7, but we mixed up the two docs, and didnt mean it to be the racist one, by the time we found out.. it was the wrong one, we had already closed the box up tight, so we couldnt log back in, through the exploit.<BR><BR>please accept this humble appology, we ment nothing racist by that hack, it was a mistake on our part, and we hope you will forgive us for it.<BR>
<BR>Thankyou,<BR><i>vent & The Level Seven Crew</i>
