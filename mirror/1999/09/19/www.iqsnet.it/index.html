Hello. There are many things I find annoying, and people like v-t is
one of them. He thinks he's so cool because he can type,
./statd www.open.ac.uk and deface the website. He isn't cool,
he has 0 coding abilities and wouldn't know a C compiler if it hit him in the
face. He is an idiot. And while I don't condone hacking websites I
needed to have my say about this friendless little child.
Oh, btw: rpcinfo -p www.open.ac.uk anyone?
