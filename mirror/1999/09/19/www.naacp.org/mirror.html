Data holds information, technology holds the data, humans create the technology to control the data, but 
yet many humans cannot control nor harness the true power of this technology. Besides the creators... 
some few of us embark on a quest to understand this technology, while some of us just try and use it. 
The ones that want to not only understand the technology... but want to control it to the level of 
its creators. This is the hacker.... the rest...  ?

The internet is our play ground, its our side of the tracks. When you step into it, claim your own 
corner of cyberspace, and put up your house...  dont expect not to arouse our curiosity. With thousands 
of large organizations, instituations, and companys who already have their spot on the net.. and the 
thousands on their way...  this is a message to you, and a message to the people that you trust to run 
and protect your data.

Be carefull. As hackers we are not out to destroy you.. we are here to watch, wait, and learn. 
As i have said before, we are the knights of the internet. We see and hear things that you think 
you only hear and see, we are places only you think you can go. We watch what you do.
