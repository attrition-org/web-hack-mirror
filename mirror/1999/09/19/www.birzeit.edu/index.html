Hello. This is the second hack dedicated to the small friendless child
know as "vendetta" or "v-t" as he likes to be known. I am trying to
demonstrate that anyone, if they want, can deface websites. v-t, and well,
most kiddies sitting behind their computers think they are special for
doing it. Do something purposeful kids, learn how to code.
Oh yeah, sorry to the sys admin of this site, you need to install OpenBSD
and lose RedHat, man...
