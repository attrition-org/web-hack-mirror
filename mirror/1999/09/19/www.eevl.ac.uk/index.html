there people.... I think now is the time that lore of b4b0 is finally expossed for what he
<U>really</U> is.... Hiding behind his keyboard in the world of make believe on IRC lore
has finally been accepted.  He has <I>fooled</I> many people into thinking he is a 'cool',
'know-it-all' elite, well sorry lore to send your imaginary world crashing down but they gotta
know the <I><U>TRUTH</U></I>...<P>lore is a little skinny <U><I>SPOILT BRAT</U></I> who used
to goto a private school.... At school he got picked on like hell of a particular group in
his science class so much that occasionally he would start crying in the class and Mr Murphy
would send him home to mammy.... lore has never, i mean <U>NEVER</U> had sex in his life or
to my knowledge ever had a girlfriend....<P> His daddy had to start picking him up from school
in his posh car <I>every</I> night so he didn't get a good hiding as 2 of the group who were
involved in picking on him were expelled from school cos lore went to the headmaster and 
told on them the <U>NARK</U>....After a while the hassle got so much for our 'geek' friend lore
that he eventually changed schools<P>lore may be a good coder but he is a fucking GRASS!! 
<U>DO NOT</U> get involved in <U>ANY</U> illegal activities whatsoever with him as he <U>WILL
RAT ON YOU!</U> as some unfortunate people found out themselves....<P>Some of you may recall 
a short while ago lore 'mysteriously' dissapeared of the IRC scene for a while.  You may of
heard rumours that he got busted for hacking and was in jail or whatever lie he told you 
about where he had got to.....well i will tell you where he <U>really</U> was.......<P>
lore and a group of others were 'carding' stuff... well to cut a long story short lore got
arrested and was charged with 'obtaining goods by deception'.... lore was 'originally'
the <U>ONLY</U> one who got arrested as the police were 'totally' unaware of the identity
of the others that were involved in the conspiracy...well that was until our 'cool' du0d lore
decided to <U>RAT ON THEM!</U> the little tit....after the police were nicely informed of the 
indentities and addresses of the others involved they all got arressted and sentanced to 
240 hours community service and ordered to pay court costs...<P>
lore was grounded for a couple of months by his mammy & daddy and was not allowed to use the
'net' so he was unseen in that time.  The guys that were <U>NARKED</U> on by good old lore
are still waiting to 'thank' lore for his good deed.....<P>
