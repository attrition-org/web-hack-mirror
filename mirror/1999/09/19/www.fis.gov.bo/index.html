Greetings people!  Just because you're from the United States of America 
doesn't mean that you're better than everyone
else in the whole world.  And just because your name is ACIDBURN doesn't 
mean that you've got all the zeroday warez.  And
just because you've got your tongue pierced doesn't mean that you're the 
hottest shit around.  AND A BIG FUCK YOU GOES
OUT TO V-T!  YOU SON-OF-A-CAT!  HRFN!  HRFN!  HRFN!  STATD THIS, YOU 
PUNK!  Anyway, don't hurt small animals.  I'm out!

(Hello El Hyphen Neenja!)
