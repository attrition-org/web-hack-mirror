about how to install a Haltech F9 onto a Mazda 13B Turbo, the same goes
for any engine.</font></font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+3>Mount
the Sensors</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Map
Sensor :</font><font size=+2> </font>The Map Sensor should be located in
the engine bay away from any direct heat , and it should also be mounted
higher than the injector locations so as to not have any fuel run down
the vacuum line and kill the sensor. The vacuum line should be connected
to a constant vacuum source such as the inlet plenum , or a place where
it gets a vacuum signal from all rotors or cylinders. On the picture below
you can see a good place to run the line from on a 13B Turbo engine.</font></font>
<p><img SRC="MapSensor.jpg" height=240 width=320>&nbsp; <font face="Arial,Helvetica">On
the outside of the inlet manifold.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Coolant Temperature Sensor
: </font>The Coolant Sensor is a bit tougher to install. You may need to
drill and tap a hole to screw it into. It should be located before the
thermostat , but in the housing for it. If you mount it the wrong side
the actual engine water temperature will be different to that of which
the sensor is reading. The picture below shows where to mount it on a 13B
Turbo , but a similar place should be used for all engines.</font>
<p><img SRC="CoolantSensor.jpg" height=240 width=320>&nbsp; <font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mounted
below the thermostat</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Air Temperature Sensor :

</font>The Air Temperature Sensor should be located in the air stream
of the inlet manifold , but away from any ambient heat that will disrupt
the readings. If you are running a turbo engine then it should be mounted
after the intercooler. The next picture below shows the correct locating
point for a 13B Turbo engine.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Throttle Position Sensor
:&nbsp; </font>(Or TPS). This is a tricky one , as you will no doubt have
to make a bracket to hold the TPS body still. The throttle shaft may also
have to be modified to properly interface with the sensor. The inner section
of the TPS should rotate with the throttle shaft , and this should happen
the instant the throttle shaft is rotated. There should be absolutely no
play in the shaft to sensor movement. If there is you will never eliminate
slight stumbles when you drive and first touch the throttle. Any movement
with the throttle should coincide with moevement of the sensor. Do now
worry about zero-ing the sensor yet , as this is done in the programming
software. But be sure that the sensor does not inhibit the throttle shaft
movement or it may jam the throttle open. Also be sure to mount it to the
primary throttle and not a secodary throttle. See the picture below of
the TPS on a 13B Turbo ( you sick of the 13B Turbo pics yet :-).</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+3>Wiring</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">Wiring the rest
of the system is easy , and I will cover it shortly.&nbsp; All that is
basically needed is to follow the instuctions in the manual. The only slightly
confusing point for most people is the wiring of the fuel pump relay. In
fact it is already wired and relayed. The two orange wires that you have
to connect are very simple to do. One of them ( any one ) goes to the battery
+ve terminal as it must have constant 12V , and the other orange wire goes
to you fuel pump +ve. The other terminal on your fuel pump goes to earth.</font></font>
