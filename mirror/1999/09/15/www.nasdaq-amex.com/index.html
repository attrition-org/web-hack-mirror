The Attrition staff has recreated the HTML from the defacement
using current HTML from the NASDAQ Web site and text from the 
screenshot. We were originally unable to take a mirror of the
HTML due to the ASP scripts running on the server. In comparison 
to the screen shot, your browser's rendering of the HTML
recreation may look different due to your browser's settings.
