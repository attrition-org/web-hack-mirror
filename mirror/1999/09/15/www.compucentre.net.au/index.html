<p>Political expression and freedom of speech are rights given to me under
the UNITED NATIONS universal declaration of human rights.<p>

<p>On Jan 1 2000 the Australian Government will be limiting the freedom of
speech of it's people through the adoption of internet censorship.

<p>We've left .au because of CENSORSHIP.

<p>Last one out, turn of the lights!
