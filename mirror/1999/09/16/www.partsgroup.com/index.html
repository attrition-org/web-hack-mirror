      <center>partsgroup.com hacked - thursday september 16th, 1999</center><br>

      <dd>Sorry, Parts Group... You left yourself wide open. This isn't done with anything malicious in mind. But your security sucks ass.<br>
      <br>
      <dd>Dellete strikes again... As long as servers continue to have shitty security, we will continue to do this. This is the second page I've fucked with in 3 days. And there were oh-so-many more opportunities. But hey, I've got a life outside of computers. But sometimes you come across a server with such shitty security and such large, obvious holes that you just can't resist. My advice to you, Parts Group (haha, like you give a shit right about now, get over your anger at being hacked and listen up) is to fire whoever set up this site and get someone who knows what they are doing. I won't tell you how I got in. I -will- tell you that's it's not going to be how it might look. WAY too obvious. Get real, look deeper. You may think you've figured out how it was done, but if that's where you stop, then you can still be fucked with. Learn a lesson from this.<br>
      <br>
      <dd>Get your security fixed.<br>
      <br>
      <dd>Before you go completely ape shit, I just thought I'd tell you that I didn't screw with your files. Your <a href="index.dellete.html">original index file</a> is still there, I just renamed it to index.dellete.html... so relax. Put your site back up and be glad you didn't get fucked with hardcore. I'm not that mean.<br>
      <br>
      <dd>Shout outs to all of Dellete, and all that bs.<br>

      </ul>
      <br>
      P.S.: For those of you who saw my last page hack... I know the message was kind of childish (esp. when I told you to spam ole' JP of AntiOnline). Well, get over it. It was meant to be. I swear, some of you are so uptight, you don't recognize humor and sarcasm when you see it.<br>
