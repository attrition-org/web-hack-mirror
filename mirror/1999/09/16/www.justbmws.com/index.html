  <dd>Well once again a non-secure server...I respect BMW's...they are cool little cars, but
  that doesn't justify an insecure server...SunOS 5.6? oh well...who am I to critisize...anyhow
  I'm not going to bother with trying to justify my hack...nah...maybe I will, otherwise I'll
  feel bad about it...I did this to prove that security is a must...so what if it's some small
  no name webpage that gets a few hits each day...and I will feel bad about doing this either way
  since I am destroying someone's pride and dreams...then again I did back up their webpage, and
  I don't intend on deleting anything...why be malicious...this is tons o'fun...
  <br><br>
  <dd>Greets to the scene, greets to the folks on IRC who keep asking me to greet them (NOsen, etc)
  and uhm greets to the rest of Dellete...

  <dd>To access the real site, click <a href="index.dellete.html">here</a>.
  To get your website back just copy index.dellete.html over index.html...Sorry for the trouble...
