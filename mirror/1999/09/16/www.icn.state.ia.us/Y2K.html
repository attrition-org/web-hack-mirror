    <P>On 10/19/98, President Clinton signed into law the &quot;Year
    2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.&quot;  This Act
    provides limited liability and evidentiary admissibility protections
    for Year 2000 statements which are designated as &quot;Year 2000
    Readiness Disclosure.&quot;  Pursuant to the Act, following is
    a transmittal of the Iowa Communications Network (ICN) statement
    addressing Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure.</P>

    <P>Excellent progress is being made on the conversion.  Below
    are the major components of the ICN&#146;s Year 2000 Compliance
    Project:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>The DMS 500 Digital Switch has undergone a series of two
      software upgrades completed January 27, 1999, bringing the device
      into compliance with the Year 2000.
      <LI>The ROLM PBX switches, owned and operated by the ICN, have
      already been upgraded.
      <LI>The IowaHub (enterprise messaging hardware and software)
      was upgraded during October 1998, and Year 2000 verification
      testing has been successfully completed.
      <LI>Video Operation and Scheduling Software from Grass Valley
      has been replaced with Year 2000 compliant software.  The software
      platform went operational on November 28, 1998, and the new Year
      2000 compliant software was tested and accepted.
      <LI>NORTEL network transport equipment has been surveyed by NORTEL
      and all necessary changes are in process.
      <LI>ICN has received network element compliance statements from
      vendors on all elements not detailed above confirming compliance
      with the Year 2000.
      <LI>The circuit management and fault management software platforms
      for the network are being upgraded in the next few months as
      well.
    </UL>

    <P>As the upgrade of each network element is completed, the equipment
    and software dates are rolled forward to Year 2000, tested for
    compliance, then rolled back for ongoing operations. </P>

    <P>A final network roll forward is planned for early October
    1999 to verify that everything is functioning properly.  </P>
