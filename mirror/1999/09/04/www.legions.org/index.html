<P>Got r00ts?  We sure do.  And so should you.  <B>Stop Marijuana Prohibition NOW!</B>
Since 1937 the US Federal Government has prohibited marijuana with little regard to the facts.  They learned through alcohol that prohibition doesn't work.  Every single day, otherwise
law-abiding citizens are arrested for posession of marijuana.  I urge you to learn the facts.  30 states have passed laws recognizing the medicinal use of marijana. [1]  The first recorded
medicinal use of marijuana dates back to 2727 B.C. [2], in which time no one has ever died from a marijuana overdose.  Think about how many people die from aspirin or
alcohol each and every day.</P>
<P>Besides getting da 420 b4k3d 0ff 0ur 4ss3s, marijuana has many other uses.  Besides the well known effects of reducing naseau, increasing appetite, and giving a feeling of euphoria,
it has the added effects of drying out your mouth.  [420:  d1s is g00d?]  Yes, this is good.  Dentists sometimes need to dry your mouth when they perform oral surgery, and guess what?  The
drug they currently use can kill you.  Our t1p?  Smoke a fat blunt on the way to the dentist.</P>
<P>Besides sm0king w33d, there's other uses for hemp.  For making paper, h3mp outyeilds trees at least 3 to 1.[3]  Hemp can be used as a f00d, fiber for clothes, and fuel.</P>

Note to the script kiddies:  Get some style.  Hack for a reason.  Defacing pages to give shout-outs and disses to people is lame.  Learn some skills, learn unix, learn to program.
Ultimatly learn to spot your own exploits, read the source, hack the kernel.  Share your knowledge.  Information is power, and knowledge wants to be free.  If you *insist* on doing
defacements, do it for a reason, not because you can.  Actually sit down and *design* the page, research the things on said page, and do it right.  Last, be original.
