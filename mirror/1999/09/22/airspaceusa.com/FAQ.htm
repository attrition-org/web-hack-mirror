<h3><a name="how">How do I get airport analysis information onto the FAA Form 7460-1?</a></h3>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Analysis module from the toolbar in AIRSPACE<sup>®</sup>.</li>
  <li>Enter information specific to your site (latitude, longitude, elevation data, etc.)</li>
  <li>After you have completed the information, select the Check Mark icon from the Analysis
    module toolbar.</li>
  <li>After the nearest city information and all corrections have been made, select the
    Analysis icon from the Analysis module toolbar.</li>
  <li>Observe the series of lights in the upper right of the module. These lights represent
    the reports being generated by AIRSPACE<sup>®</sup>.</li>
  <li>When analysis is complete, the lights will turn white.</li>
  <li>Close this form and select the US Department of Transportation icon (FAA Form 7460-1)
    from the toolbar in AIRSPACE<sup>®</sup>.</li>
  <li>When the FAA 7460-1 form opens, select the left most icon (New) from the 7460-1 form
    toolbar. </li>
  <li>An &quot;Open File&quot; window will appear. Select the file name you gave this analysis
    in the Analysis module.</li>
  <li>. Blocks 4 and 5 will now reflect the results of the analysis.</li>
</ol>

<p>Blocks 4 and 5 of the FAA Form 7460-1 now show your analysis data.</p>

<h3><a name="where">Where can I find airport identifiers?</a></h3>

<p>Airport identifiers or &quot;Idents&quot; are code words for airports. Idents, like
&quot;ORD,&quot; represent airports. In this case ORD means Chicago O'Hare International
Airport. </p>

<p>The first report produced during an analysis is the Airport Report. This reports
discovers the landing facilities that are near your proposed site.&nbsp; This report
should be the first report you review after an analysis. It provides information on
Federal Aviation Regulation 77.13, &quot;Notice Criteria.&quot; It lists the distance to
the nearest point of the nearest runway.</p>

<p>The identifier or Ident is listed in the left most column of the report. If you need
additional information about this airport go to the TERPS<sup>®</sup> program and open an
airport using this 3 or 4 alphanumeric code. A window will open providing you will
additional information such as Airport Reference Point data and Magnetic Variation.</p>

<h3><a name="why">Why doesn't the airport report show, in every case, distance to the
nearest runway?</a></h3>

<p>For many years now the Federal Aviation Administration has had a program to survey all
airports (and runways) in the National Airspace System (NAS). This program is ongoing.
They increase the number of surveyed runways every 56 days. The average number of new
runways added to the data is approximately 10 to 20 every two months. This data is checked
by our staff for accuracy (we have found mistakes) before we accept the data into our data
base. We research and fix errors. If we can not verify the data, we do not use it. </p>

<p>If an airport does not have data for its runways AIRSPACE<sup>®</sup> uses an
algorithm to predict potential penetrations of the Horizontal and Conical surfaces. If the
actual runway data is not available AIRPSACE<sup>®</sup> enters the distance to the
Airport Reference Point (ARP) on the FAA Form 74601-1 in nautical miles.</p>

<h3><a name="who">Who provides training on FAA procedures and software?</a></h3>

<p>Our instructor has almost 30 years of service with the FAA and has been involved in the
obstacle evaluation process for over half of that time.</p>

<p>Federal Airways &amp; Airspace, the creators of AIRSPACE<sup>®</sup> and TERPS<sup>®</sup>,
provide training to individuals, companies, and state governments, if requested. We come
to your place of business and provide training to your entire staff for one fee. We
believe in training as many individuals as possible in a company so they can work together
to develop your sites as fast as possible by making site selections early in the design
stage. Please contact us via email <a href="mailto:(faa@airspaceusa.com">(FAA@AirspaceUSA.com</a>)
if your would like additional information.</p>

<h3><a name="what">What is TERPS<sup>®</sup>?</a></h3>

<p>TERPS<sup>®</sup> stands for Terminal Instrument Procedures. Terminal Instrument
Procedures or TERPS<sup>®</sup> surfaces are constructed from the electronic signals
transmitted by ground and space based air navigation electronic equipment. These are the
instrument procedures that aircraft pilots use to fly between airports and land on
runways.</p>

<p>TERPS<sup>®</sup> surfaces are different than FAR Part 77, sub-Part C, imaginary
obstacle surfaces that surround airport. These instrument surfaces can extend 10 nautical
miles from a runway, where as, obstacle surfaces normally extend only 10,000 feet.</p>

<p>Our TERPS<sup>®</sup> Professional software displays the airport runway configuration,
your proposed site, existing obstacles, and ground based electronic air navigation
facilities (VOR, NDB, ILS, etc). To visually see the effects of a TERPS<sup>®</sup>
surface, select the procedure from the Map menu (Draw Procedures), locate, click and hold
on the runway end. Now drag the the mouse cursor in the opposite direction of the approach
course and the TERPS<sup>®</sup> trapezoid will be drawn on the screen to scale when you
release the mouse button. This capability is not available in the standard version of
TERPS<sup>®</sup>.</p>

<h3><a name="when">When is new data available?</a></h3>

<p>New data is available every odd month. Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Sep, and Nov. In addition to
new data, software upgrades are shipped at the same time.</p>
