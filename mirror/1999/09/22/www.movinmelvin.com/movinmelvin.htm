innovative style of dancing. He has combined the <B>styles</B> of many
of the masters including Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis, Bojangles, Gene Kelly,
Gregory Hines and the Nicholes Brothers, to create a high energy show of
tap dancing, juke dancing, clogging, swing, and contemporary dance. </P>

dance lesson or two to learn any of sixty different dance steps, which
were popular from the 1940's to the 1990's.</P>

<P>As a major draw card for Festivals, Trade shows, Casinos, Clubs, Schools,
Health clubs, Colleges, Shopping Centers, Malls and so on, Movin' Melvin
not only performed, but also did workshops on Tap, Juke Dancing, and Clogging.
</P>

<P>These Dancing and Health workshops bring something very unique to a
world that has become more exercise and health conscious. The workshops,
drew large numbers from every age group (mostly female) and were a GREAT
success. </P>

<P>The success of these workshops is due to the fact that Melvin is able
to teach most who attend how <IMG SRC="TOUR.GIF" HEIGHT=178 WIDTH=167 ALIGN=RIGHT>to
do something with Tap, Juke, and Clogging, after just one workshop. And
he is asked to return as soon as possible.</P>

<P>Due to the popularity of the workshops, Melvin recently <FONT SIZE=-1>(using
his Knowledge of health gathered for the last thirty seven years)</FONT>
produced a Video, called <FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="healthvideo.htm">Tap into
Health</A></FONT>. A tap, juke, clogging, and health video. Sale of this
video helps support the <FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="world.htm">&quot;Change
This World Project&quot;</A></FONT>.</P>
