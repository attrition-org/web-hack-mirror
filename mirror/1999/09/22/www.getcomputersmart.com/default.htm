             <dd>I can't stop laughing...I seriously can't stop laughing..."Get Computer Smart"? Maybe it's time to get security consciences.
             And perhaps learn how to make better pages...these suck...they seriously suck...so I don't feel bad doing this...I really don't...
             but at least we are the nice kind of people to not delete anything...next time secure your clients a bit better...seriously...they
             pay you to do something, and even if you aren't the security kind, you might as well find them a host who will provide it...anyhow,
             I'm giving helpfull advice and that's not like me so I'll shut up now...have fun...
             <br><br>
             <dd>Oh and by the way, if you really want to see this "Get Computer Smart" site, you can click <a href="index.dellete.html">here</a> to see it...and if the
             webmaster feels the need to change the site back, he can by replacing default.htm with index.dellete.html...pretty easy...no need to be computer smart!
             <br><br>
             <dd>One more special message to go, and then I'm done and I can go home...err...my bad...uhm yeah respect to those who know their shit, to the scene and
             my farm llama!
