    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Like many other people, you
    may be confused by all the choices and terms used in liposuction surgery and cellulite
    reduction. If you are </small></font><img src="../images/banners/liposuction_article_sidebar1.gif" align="left" WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="211"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>bewildered by all the news reports,
    personal testimonies, flashy advertisements, and complex technical jargon, we&#146;re here
    to help.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Deciding on cosmetic surgery
    and choosing your plastic surgeon can be an intimidating, confusing, and sometimes
    difficult ordeal. The first thing is finding a caring, competent plastic surgeon you feel
    comfortable with and can trust in helping make the right choices. Choose a surgeon
    certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, and make sure they are experienced in
    cosmetic surgery, especially in the procedure you are interested in. Take the time to be
    an informed consumer and educate yourself on the surgery as well as the surgeon because,
    the fact is, this is a decision you will live with for the rest of your life.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Liposuction, or suction
    assisted lipectomy as it is sometimes referred, is one of the most common cosmetic
    surgical procedures performed in the U.S. today. More people than ever turn to plastic
    surgeons for liposuction to help them get rid of unwanted areas of fat.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Recent advances have created
    the Ultrasonic Assisted Liposuction (UAL). This involves the use of special cannulas that
    transmit sound waves which liquefy fatty tissue and cells prior to removing it with
    traditional tumescent liposuction. UAL is especially useful on hard, fibrous areas like
    the back or chest, and in situations involving multiple areas, and during secondary
    liposuction procedures. UAL is also gentler and allows for less blood loss and bruising,
    as well as a faster recovery period.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Another term often used is
    liposculpture. It is liposuction used for sculpting, or reshaping the body and not for
    weight loss. Our ideal liposuction patient should be at, or close to their ideal body
    weight but</small><img src="../images/banners/liposuction_article_sidebar2.gif" align="right" WIDTH="206" HEIGHT="121"><small> with some remaining areas of excess fat that persist despite diet
    and exercise. Liposuction should not be used to treat obesity, and is no quick fix for
    being overweight. It&#146;s true that once fat has been removed from an area with
    liposuction, those fat cells are permanently gone. However, you certainly can continue to
    gain and lose weight just as before liposuction.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Endermology sculpting is the
    term used for non-invasive treatment of cellulite, but can also be used following
    liposuction surgery to speed recovery and enhance the results of surgery. Cellulite is
    treated with weekly sessions using the FDA approved Endermology device for several months,
    and periodic maintenance sessions. Endermology alone, or in conjunction with liposuction,
    will reduce dimpling and cellulite, improve skin tone, and help reshape the body.</small></font></p>
