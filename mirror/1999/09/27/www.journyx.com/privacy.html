journyx is committed to respecting your privacy.  We recognize your need
for appropriate
protection and management of personally identifiable information you share
with us.  That is
why journyx has established this privacy policy.  We want you to understand
the care with which we treat your personal information. 
<p>

In general, you can visit journyx.com without telling us who you are or revealing
any personal
information about yourself.  We track the Internet address of the domains from
which people visit
us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but the individual user
remains anonymous.
<p>

Our demo utilizes "cookies" so that we  can better serve you.  Cookies are identifiers which a Web
site can send to your
browser to keep on <u>your</u> computer to facilitate your next visit to our
site.  You can set your browser
to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide
whether or not to accept
it.  The information we collect in our demo is used to better serve you.  The
product is set-up to use cookies to allow you to better track who is accessing
the software.

<p>To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:

<p>

<p><strong>INFORMATION</strong>

<p>

<p>We want to give you information about our privacy policy and assure you that
we take reasonable
steps to see that it is followed within our company.

<p>

<strong>CHOICE</strong>

<p>

There are times when we may collect personal information from you.  It is our
intent to inform you
before we do that and to tell you what we intend to do with the information.
You will have the
option not to provide the information, and in the future you will be able to
"opt out" of certain uses
of the information.  If you choose not to provide the information we request,
you can still visit most
of the journyx.com Web site, but you may be unable to access certain options,
offers, and services.
<p>


<p><strong>SECURITY</strong>

<p>
We will take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us
from unauthorized access or disclosure.  None of your information will be
sold. Ever.

<p>

<p><strong>COMMITMENT</strong>

<p>

<p>Personal data privacy is a new and evolving area, and journyx is
evolving to meet these demands. Mistakes are possible; miscommunication is possible.  If you have
any comments or questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact
us at <a href="mailto:info@journyx.com">info@journyx.com</a>.  We will address any issue to the best of our abilities.

<p>

Thank you for your support of these policies and of journyx.
