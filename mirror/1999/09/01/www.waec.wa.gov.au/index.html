    </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>I</strong>t is quite amazing, if you look at
    attrition, how many boxes are broken into and the http defaced. At how many boxes have
    proven to be insecure, even sites of major companies, etc. The Government/Military has
    proven to be insecure... Almost every country has been proven insecure. Every operating
    system and server has been proven faulty. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>I</strong>t makes you wonder where
    all of these security professionals are. People are to lazy/cheap to hire them. I mean if
    your a hosting site, you need to deliver the best service to your clients, as in not
    having them come online one day and see 'graffiti' tagged thier by a member of the
    underground society. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>E</strong>ven more, hackers get
    blamed for damage that is hardly fair. I mean we always back files up and never delete,
    sure, the company could lose business because it's main page is not available. But, is
    that really our fault, the admin should fix the error/problem in under an hour, which is
    usually the case. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>T</strong>he only purpose to this
    'hack' was to state exactly what I just stated, that admins don't care enough about thier
    box to secure it or hire someone to secure it. I recommend you go to <a
    href="http://www.securityfocus.com">Security Focus</a> and read up on security and how to
    avoid these kind of problems.</font></p>
