    <P><font face="Arial" size="-1">Our objective is to create a partnership, so when your project is complete,
    we all agree that every alternative was explored in devising the best solution(s)
    to your design program.</P>
    <P>Our results oriented, team approach creates an atmosphere where you
    have an essential impact on the design process all the way from concept
    to completion.</P>
    <P><I>When we build, we are telling the world what we stand for. Our structures
    will influence our lives for a very long time. The choices we have in hand
    to achieve this influence are legion; no longer is it a simple matter of
    bricks and mortar, windows and doors. New methods, new systems and a seemingly
    endless demand from more and more people give the designer fascinating
    opportunities at every turn...</P>
    <P>Another important factor in our usefulness to clients is our dedication
    to the principle of human orientation and scale. Our fundamental conviction
    in approaching the design of every project is that architecture is for
    people... the greatest challenge to the architect is to recreate environments
    for people... Elegance, grace, style, functional efficiency, economy and
    durability are still as important to owners as ever, but today the most
    pressing need is for human spaces in which people can live and breathe.</i><BR>
