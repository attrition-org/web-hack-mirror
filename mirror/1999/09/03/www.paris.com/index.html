Whoohoo.
<br>
We're in.
<br>
This page was .. mmh how is it you young people say ? 0wned ? <br>
Well call it however you want.. defaced, cracked, hacked, rooted, the thing
is, we now have the control of this website.
<br>
Pretty cool huh ?
<br>
So I guess that means we can put whatever we want here.. nice ..<br>
<br><b>PARIS SUCKS !</b> (well.. so does all of France)
 <br>
If you're thinking of going there for a romantic trip (or a whatever trip),
please think twice ! Don't make the same mistake I did ! <br>
People there stink, litteraly, they wash once or twice a week. Streets 
smell like urine, french people are arrogant and stupid, and  
<b>they cheated at the soccer world cup !</b>

And in case you're wondering.. no we didn't just change this page to write
this crap about Paris.. we changed it to put this cool logo we made (noticed
how we say "We" when it's just one pathetic looser who wants to make people
believe he acutally has friends.. but hey, you've got to have a group to
look good)
<br><br>
Usual crap:<br><br>
Greetings to nuX!, gdr, mommy and .. uuuh.. keebler elves ? you guys are really funny.
