      <center>scmctc.com hacked - tuesday september 14th, 1999</center><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <dd>Our apologies to Millennium Computers and Technology Center... this hack is not aimed at you, specifically. We are just using you as an example of what having poor security could mean. Security is a serious issue, and too many people don't pay attention to it.<br>
      <br>
      <dd>DeLLeTe is  a small, relatively unknown group of computer users who take shit like this serious. We aren't in this for money, attention or recognition. We have nothing agaist anyone, except those people who think that computer security isn't that big of a deal (a.k.a. the "it won't happen to me" people) and the goverment (that's just MoP). Beyond that, we don't have any political/religous/social issues to bring up here. All we really have to say is... <i>pay fucking attention</i>. If you don't take security seriously, then you deserve what you get. We know that you'll probably be pissed that your page got hacked. You should really be thanking us for alerting you of your problem without doing any system damage. Your <a href="index.dellete.html">original index file</a> is untouched by us (it's named index.dellete.html). Nothing else was touched.<br>
      <br>
      <dd>Get your security fixed.<br>
      <br>
      <dd>Greets go out to <a href="http://www.attrition.org">attrition.org</a>, all the DeLLeTe peeps (you know who you are) and everyone who's a part of the hack/phreak scene in 303 (not you, you xDSL & cable modem script kiddie hacker wannabes, fuck all of you, you aren't a part of shit, you're nothing but a rash on the ass of real hackers, you give the rest of us a bad name, you DoS bitches).<br>
      <br>

      <dd><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;When all else fails you can be sure we will fail too...</i>
      </ul>
      <br>
      P.S. to the Government: <i>FUCK YOU</i>. We WILL survive. You may take some of us, but you will never get all of us. Some battles may be yours, but we will win the war.<br>
      <br>
      P.S. to everyone else: Spam <a href="mailto:jp@antionline.com">John Vranesevich</a> of AntiOnline.com... he's a poser, a loser and a fucking idiot to boot.<br>
