    Spam Software. - Using a new and unique approach to deal with junk e-mail, SpammerSlammer
    marks bulk advertisements and most other unwelcomed mail from advertisers before they get
    to your Inbox so you can deal with them anyway you choose. <br>
    <br>
    SpammerSlammer uses an intelligent decision making approach to mark spams using one of 5
    different levels based on various internet standards and other e-mail conventions. There's
    no need to filter out everyone from an entire domain. <br>
    <br>
    Knowing that people around the Net receive all different types of e-mail, SpammerSlammer
    will never delete a message. When SpammerSlammer finds a message it does not like it will
    add a special tag to the subject of the message. Most e-mail programs, such as Eudora and
    Outlook, provide filtering capabilities that will let you send these messages right to
    your Trash folder or any folder you choose for final browsing before you delete them all
    at once. SpammerSlammer allows you to include or exclude specific addresses to filter or
    ignore.</small><br>

    simply entering a keyword and selecting from several popular search engines. On the

    can help you improve your business operations by allowing individuals to evaluate their
    performance on a range of organizational interactions with an easy-to-use questionnaire.
    Take the test yourself, then let your supervisors evaluate workers and let subordinates
    provide feedback to superiors. Ask your customers for feedback, or get evaluations from
    peers in other divisions of the company or in other companies that you work with. The
    program lets you send feedback requests through your installed email client and then
    integrate email replies to paint a clear profile of what you are doing well and what needs
    improvement. Flag the weak spots in your performance and define actions to improve. Seeing
    yourself as others see you may be the first step on the road to success.</small><br>

    run slowly, the fault could lie with Windows disk cache management, which takes up most of
    the available physical memory. When your system runs out of RAM, Windows starts to use
    hard-disk-based virtual memory instead of flushing the disk caches. You can use Cacheman
    to adjust this behavior. When you start the program, you'll see your free available
    physical memory (which should increase after you optimize). Select one of the
    optimizations methods from the pull-down menu. To make the settings permanent use the Save
    command. Then, exit the program and reboot your system to activate the new disk cache
    adjustments. Advanced settings let you make more precise adjustments. Many systems should
    see better system performance because of less frequent use of the swap file. Cacheman is
    easy to use, and features separate recommended settings for Win95 and Win98.</font></small><br>

    A scheduler is included to automate the process. Other features include disk space charts
    and the ability to create a desktop backup set shortcut. On the downside, Zip Projects
    doesn't offer nearly the flexibility it should in regard to defining your backup sets.
    Each set contains a single folder -- period. There is no way to add individual files,
    define file filters, add more than one folder, or have it back up files recursively.
    Hopefully, these oversights will be remedied by the time the program comes out of beta.</small></font><br>
