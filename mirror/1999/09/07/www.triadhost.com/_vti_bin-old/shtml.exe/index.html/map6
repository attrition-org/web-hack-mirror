as concerned people of the planet, we are here to voice our outrage about the genocide taking place in east timor.
as long as east timor has been under indonesian control, killing has been going on. the UN should place an armed
peace keeping force in east timor to protect them from the tyranny of indonesia, who sat by and watched its own
military murder innocent people. you cant just sit there and watch them slaughter innocent people without being
involved in this. indonesia started this mass genocide and thinks it can get away with it because they have
control over the east timor region. once again, just like kosovo and china's oppresion, this is a violation of
human rights. rights that should and need to be protected, though some countries (i.e. china and indonesia) seem
to think differently about this. all the countries in the southeast asian region, such as indonesia, are dissing
china for its communist attitude. but indonesia shouldn't be talking, for they kill their own people with no hard
feelings, no mercy. one has been led to believe that everything's ok and that everything is under control, but
it is far from ok. unless you are a cruel non-feeling person, you cant let this slip by you without expressing your
feelings about this. dont let indonesia's tyranny get to you, revolt, fight against it, stand up and raise your
voices as one, saying &quot;we will not take this, this ruthless killing has to stop&quot;. soldiers have cut down
all phone lines in east timor, so no information is coming out to the outside world. these people are being deserted
by their own government. how would it feel to live in east timor? to not be able to go to sleep because of fear
of being murdered. not being able to tell anyone out there whats going on. we all go to sleep at night knowing that
we are protected. doesnt it feel safe? -- ask the people in east timor the same question and be shocked.

someone's father or son. someone's mother or daughter. someone's sister or brother. how would you feel if this was
your family? how would you react? how could you react if you couldnt even get to them? write/fax/phone/mail your government
and let your voice count. tell them they cant just let this pass by as if its nothing, because it is. dont be like all
the rest, dont just go out and ignore this. get out there and tell whats going on. make a fucking difference.
