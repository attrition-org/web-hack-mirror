It demands a professional woman who aspires to:<ul><li>own her own business, <li>be her own boss, and<li>maintain a positive and healthy attitude.</ul> It also takes a special woman who:<ul><li>is a self starter, <li>has extraordinary ethics due to the sensitive nature of the products,<li>truly cares that women learn about, and become more comfortable with, their own sexuality and sensuality.</ul>The last point is done through fun and educational in-home confidential parties for women.  Having the party in the home environment helps everybody feel comfortable and safe.  This is a place where they discover new products and learn new ways of enhancing their intimate relationships.  They also get to take everything they learn and purchase home with them that very night.   </b></font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>You don't have to have a college degree in Human Relationships to become part of this incredibly, fast-growing industry.  But, you must care strongly enough to learn more than what you may currently know about women's issues.  Not only the most personal and intimate issues, but also the challenges we face daily in the attempt of "coming to grips" with, and understanding, our own sexuality.  Socially and privately there can be a constant struggle, "What is right..what is wrong?"</b><p><b>Unfortunately, it is very common for a  woman to wonder if she's different from all other women when it comes to her own body and personal sexuality.  When she has questions, there are very few places	she feels comfortable going in the attempt to find her answers.  Many times those questions go unanswered for years or even forever.  This is very disconcerting to us here at <i>Coming Attractions</i>.  How can it be, that in this cosmopolitan day and age, many women continue to feel a sense of shame and guilt when it comes to her intimate thoughts and questions?  Read on!	</b></font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>It is our goal to reach as many women as possible.  This can only occur if we have confident and caring leaders on board helping us to blaze the trail.  It is every <i>Romance Consultant's</i> job and duty to inform and educate women that whatever is comfortable for her both sensually and sexually, is probably perfectly normal.  She needs to be assured that most any experimentation she would like to pursue is a positive thing (we are here to educate, not judge).  And, <i>with</i> or <i>without</i> a partner!<p>CAPI provides training, a professional Advisory Board, and an incredible support network to assist the new consultant in her endeavors to be successful and to reach her personal and financial goals.
