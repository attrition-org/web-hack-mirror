								<td valign="top">Many people don't know that they can utilize various search engines when they are searching for something specific and can't seem to find it.  Many AOL users tend to utilize NetFind (Excite) as their search engine (like I always did) because they don't know that there are others they can use or how to access them.  The link I've included goes to AltaVista's search engine because it's one of my favorites as it allows you to search in various languages.  To try other search engines, all you have to do is to type in the name of the search engine after the www. part and before the .com part, (i.e. www.yahoo.com) in your browser.  Some other major search engines are Lycos, HotBot, Snap, WebCrawler and OpenText.  You can find a lot more information this way.  Most even offer free email and free personal websites so take a stroll down search engine lane!
