Shortly after the US Embassy defacement by this group,
we were notified by a reporter from MSNBC
that they were e-mailed and threatened by vent, 
leader of the group. We have received permission to post
this e-mail by its recipient. 

Due to the message in this defacement, we felt posting 
this e-mail was necessary to show the irony of
vent's words:

Subject: US Embassy Hack.. Alan Boyle, please read.


I am vent from The Level Seven Crew. the group responsible for the US 
Embassy hack (www.usembassy-china.gov). We wish for you to write a story 
about us, so that we may prove a point.

CNN has already done this, and interviewed us on the topic at hand.  I have 
emailed you, and only you.. requesting this. Denying the request, will be a 
loss for you, as well as us.  I will not re-communicated with you, if you 
deny this request. so please make a fair choice.

    - vent (co-pres)
- The Level Seven Crew
