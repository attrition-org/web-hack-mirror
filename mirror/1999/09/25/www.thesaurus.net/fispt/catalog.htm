        <p>Barcelona, 31th October 1996 </p>
        <p>Dear friends, </p>
        <p>In the last meeting of the European Union Sport for
        All (USEpT) Board of Directors the creation of &#147;The
        best hundred outdoor sport activities and adventure
        sports in Europe Catalogue&#148; was established with a
        jury for the selection of these. </p>
        <p>The idea behind the project is to annually produce a
        catalogue of the best projects, wich we hope in
        subsequent years will also include prizes with support of
        private or public sponsors. </p>
        <p>The possibility of holding a meeting or Fair under the
        reading &#147;Adventure Sports&#148; is also being looked
        into, as well as the production of a database. </p>
        <p>We should be obliged if you would forward fuller
        details of your best outdoor sport activities and
        adventure sports (see the attached <a href="guidelin.htm">guidelines</a>).
        </p>
        <p>In February 1997, a booklet will be published, and
        also in Internet pages, &#147;1996 best hundred outdoor
        sport activities and adventure sports in Europe
        catalogue&#148;. </p>
        <p>I hope you are interested in our offer, as it would be
        a chance to make your region and town activities known. </p>
        <p>I look forward to hearing from you. </p>
        <p>Yours sincerely </p>
        <p>Enric Truñó<br>
        UESpT President </p>
