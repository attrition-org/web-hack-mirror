<h1>WE'RE BACK!</h1><br><br><br>
somewhere in the beginning of '98, some hackers started the team spl0it project.<br>
they decided to use their hacking skills to bring the truth to the public.<br>
when more than a year later, one of them got busted, the team was taken down.<br>
it wasn't until then, when all the people told them how sorry they ware about our departure,<br>
that they released what kind of impact they had.<br><br>
team spl0it was silenced but not ignored. the truth has survived.<br>
a new team of inspired individuals has stepped forward to continue the team spl0it project,<br>
to continue where team spl0it left, to defend the truth from being hidden.<br>
consider us the resurrection of team spl0it, ts2k if you want :-)<br>
we will try to bring you what they try to hide, and to do it team spl0it style!<br><br><br>
HACKED BY THE NEW TEAM SPL0IT<br><br><br>
