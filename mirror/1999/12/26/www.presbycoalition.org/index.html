<p align="left"><i><b>Initiating Wetware Verification...&nbsp;</b></i></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its Christmas, and now that you're all done
blindly wondering the isles exercising the oh so versatile, convenient,
and&nbsp; unbelievably mighty purchasing power of your plastic platinum the
Black Lava Network is back to test your wetware.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You question right? Of course, we all do. By
question I don't mean, asking a question, I mean to wonder, to ponder, to philosophize,
to question. We all think about who we are, where we are, about why yellow is
yellow (and not just the science behind it), we all question to the first level.
We are all capable of first level questioning. This is referred to as
consciousness.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now go a step up. Do you ever wonder why we
question, why we ask ourselves why we are here? Ever wonder why you wonder? You
probably do. If you don't try it:&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&quot;Why do I ask myself these questions? Why do I want to
know the answers to what, who, when, where, why? Why do I want an answer?&quot;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now step up again. You ask yourself first
level questions right? You question your existence for example. And you're
capable of handling second level questions, such as why you asked yourself a
first level question. Now try a third level question. Have you ever wondered why
you wondered why you wondered in the first place? For example:</p>
<p align="center">&quot;Why am I questioning my wondering why I am capable of
asking basic philosophical questions.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">Take a second to read that. Now if that's to difficult for you,
you've probably never asked yourself third level questions before. BTW, before
we continue, I haven't read any philosophy lately and I haven't been smoking too
many trees or anything, these are my own terms. They arn't ripped.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more step. You ask yourself third level
questions, or at least you've started, good. Ask yourself a fourth level
question. Try it. Go, pick relativity. Not the old man's theory, just relativity
in general.</p>
<p align="center">&quot;Are all things relative?(1st level)<br>
Why do I care if all things are relative?(second level)<br>
Why am I questioning me asking myself if I care if all things are relative?(third level)<br>
Why am I bothering to ask myself, why I'm asking myself, why I'm able to ask
myself, if I care if all things are relative?<br>
(fourth level).&quot;</p>
<p align="left">And so on and so forth. So try this for example: why are we able to
question?<br>
Go up the levels, formulate a question for each level and answer each one till you fall asleep,
until
it possesses your every thought, until it seeps through your mind, and consumes
your existence... think about it.</p>
