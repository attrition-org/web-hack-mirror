<p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0">Hackers wanna try,
Hackers wanna lie<br>
Then Hackers wonder why, Hackers wanna die<br>
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain<br>
I cannot maintain with that shit on my brain<br>
I resort to violence, my hackers move in silence<br>
Like you don&#146;t know what our style is<br>
Uneek hackers the wildest<br>
My hackers is wit&#146; it<br>
You want it, come and get it<br>
Took it then we split it<br>
You fuckin&#146; right we did it<br>
What the fuck you gonna do when we run up on you<br>
Fuckin&#146; with the wrong crew, don&#146;t know what we
goin&#146; through </font></p>

color="#C0C0C0">This is something that I belive everyone that has
been defacing lately needs to read</font></a></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0">Does your mom know your
up this late trying to look at porn?<br>
Don't you just hate it when shit like this happens to your box?<br>
Guess, you should have fixed it last time.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0">And NO kids, this was NOT
done using that damn Msadc.pl script, There is more than one way
to rape a NT box</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0">Admin: we will patch all
the holes on your box for 1 million dollars, and some pictures of
a Britney Spears/Christina Agulera lesbian session, or just
e-mail us and ask real nice what was wrong with your box. we
might still tell you.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0">Yes, I am a criminal. My
crime is that of curiosity.<br>
My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think,<br>
not what they look like.<br>
My crime is that of outsmarting you,<br>
something that you will never forgive me for.<br>
I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.<br>
You may stop this individual,<br>
but you can't stop us all... after all,<br>
we're all alike.<br>
