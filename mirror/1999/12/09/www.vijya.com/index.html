This remote system indeed compromized... Why is that? Because of faulty Security, because of laziness and because a lack of respect for an admins job. As you look through all the defaced websites on attrition and flashback, you see the same things over and over again... "Because we can", "j00 4r3 0wn3d", "PH34R US W3 4R3 L33T" and shit like that. And the most common reason used by 'hackers' for defacing is the 'lack' of security in this modern age. The lack of security does not give you a right to deface someone's work. Just because there is something open, doesn't mean you HAVE to break in. And NOBODY has any kind of a decent message, all those who did hack for a reason are no longer active and the few that still do 'hack' for a reason, don't have much of a reason. YTCracker claims many things, claims there is a point to his hacks. I see nothing but a bunch of sites hacked by a person who found out how to upload pictures with msadc.pl. I see nothing but someone hacking for attention. Along with all of these 'new elite groups'. Come on people, get with it, hack for a reason or don't hack at all. It gets lamer and lamer each day.
