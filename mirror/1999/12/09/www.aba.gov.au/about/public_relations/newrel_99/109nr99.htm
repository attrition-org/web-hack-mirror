                rules for Australian content on commercial
                television. The study will be in partnership with
                the Australian Key Centre for Cultural and Media

                investigation of the impact of the new
                broadcasting content standard introduced in March
                1999 to meet Australia&#146;s obligations under
                the Closer Economic Relations agreement with New

                ABA&#146;s announcement comes at a time when the

                Finance Commission on the state of the film and
                TV production industry. Debate about the place of
                local content requirements in the changing
                communications landscape has intensified
                following the release of the draft report of the

                grips with the forces shaping the global
                broadcasting environment. This study will provide
                a good understanding of the complex interplay of

                (WTO) negotiations, slated for 2000. The project

                internationalised television production? Do local
                content provisions strike an appropriate balance
                for audiences in terms of the production industry
                needs for flexibility, the cultural objectives
