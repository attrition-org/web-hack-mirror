                would not be permitted to record or broadcast the
                opening statements or witness testimony at the
                hearing. He left open the possibility of

                ABA will use an accreditation scheme for
                journalists who wish to cover the hearing.
                Journalists who wish cover the hearing should
                inform the ABA in writing by 5 pm on Friday
                15&nbsp;October to ensure a seat. The ABA&#146;s

                from transcript of hearing re: televising of

                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">THE
                CHAIRMAN: At the last hearing I advised the
                parties that the Authority had received requests
                for televising proceedings. I invited
                submissions. It was argued that it was in the
                public interest that the public have access to
                these proceedings - indeed we hold the
                proceedings in public. At the same time, the
                Authority is aware that the public interest also
                requires the Authority to be fair to those
                involved. Most submissions in the first round
                were opposed to the televising of the
                proceedings, particularly testimony by witnesses.
                I think the reasons given were the potential for
                intimidation, what I would call inducement to
                Thespianism, the control of confidential and
                irrelevant material, and the need for reporting
                to be fair and balanced. Frankly, I doubt that
                discreetly placed cameras have an intimidating
                affect on witnesses, particularly in an age where
                video recording is commonplace. And it seemed
                that if we allowed for an appropriate delay and
                arranged for adequate control to ensure that
                confidential and irrelevant material did not
                escape, that would be sufficient. As to
                Thespianism, I would have thought that the
                combined effect of the Bar and the presiding
                member would be sufficient to curb any excesses.
                The problem, as I saw it, was really that the
                reporting be fair and balanced. An unguarded
                moment or an ambiguous admission is often
                balanced in a hearing on further examination. The
                panel and the members of the public who are
                present during proceedings have that opportunity
                to hear balanced testimony. The difficulty the
                Authority found was that the broadcasts of short
                extracts which might be deemed newsworthy without
                context and without any balancing testimony could
                be potentially unfair to witnesses, at times
                extremely unfair and prejudicial. Had there been
                a wish, say, on cable, to broadcast a delayed,
                uninterrupted and continuous transmission with a
                proscription against the re-broadcast of
                extracts, there would have been, I think, scope
                for the development of a fair analogy with the
                public access which we already allow in the court
                room. It is not feasible for the panel to clear
                extracts of testimony because this would
                necessarily involve consultation with the parties
                and with counsel which would soon develop into a
                parallel hearing. Apart from establishment shots
                of the opening of the hearing, the only
                outstanding matter is about the televising of the
                opening and closing addresses. </font></p>

                direct that the opening address - and I
                understand there will only be one - not be
                broadcast, but I propose to leave open the
                question of televising the closing addresses.</font></p>
