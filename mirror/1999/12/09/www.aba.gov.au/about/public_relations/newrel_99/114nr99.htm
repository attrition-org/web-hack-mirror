                Australian Broadcasting Authority has decided not

                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">The
                ABA sought applications for the licence in April
                1999. There were two applicants, Narrabri Shire
                Community Radio Inc and Kaputar FM Community
                Radio Inc. Both applicants stated that they
                represented the general community of Narrabri.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">&quot;The
                ABA decided not to allocate the licence because
                of its concerns about the ability of both
                applicants to provide a service that will meet
                the needs of the general community of
                Narrabri,&quot; said ABA Chairman Professor David
                Flint.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">&quot;In
                particular, the ABA is concerned about the open
                hostility that exists between the two applicants,
                and the effect that this hostility will have on
                the ability of either applicant to adequately
                meet the existing and perceived future needs of
                the Narrabri community,&quot; he said.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">&quot;The
                ABA has given careful consideration to the
                information provided by both applicants, as well
                as by other people in the Narrabri
                community,&quot; said Professor Flint. &quot;In
                making its decision it weighed the applications
                against the needs and interests of the community
                and the extent to which the proposed services
                would meet those needs and interests. The ABA
                also considered the applicants&#146; capacity to
                provide their proposed services and the nature
                and diversity of other broadcasting services in
                the area.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">&quot;The
                ABA encouraged the two applicants to merge, or
                come to some cooperative arrangement that would
                enable both groups to continue to provide
                programs to the Narrabri community, however, no
                such agreement could be reached,&quot; he said.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">&quot;The
                ABA will readvertise the licence in 12 months
                time. The ABA hopes that the problems that
                presently exist will be resolved by the Narrabri
                community within that time,&quot; said Professor
                Flint. </font></p>

                groups will be able to continue to provide
