<p align="left"><font color="lime" size="2" face="arial">This message is for all the Philippine Government  officials that are involved in graft and corruption. Due to you guys corruption our  country couldn't move up. Because of you leeches out there most of my fellow citizens out there are suffering. Suffering from hunger and poverty. Due to poverty they never had a chance to go to school or to have a formal education. Education that most of us took for granted. Poor People just die without knowing how to read and write. Can't you suckers see? They do have the same rights and priviledges as anybody else. But you suckers stole it from them. The rich is getting richer and richer everyday while the poor is getting poorer and poorer. You suckers are enjoying all the luxury while these people are still hanging on poverty. Everyday single day they are on the struggle fighting to survive in order to get by in life while you devils out there are just slacking doing nothing. I GUESS... </font></p>
