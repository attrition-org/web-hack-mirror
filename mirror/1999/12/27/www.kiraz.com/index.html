<center><b>[<font color="gray">My 2 cents!</font>]</b></center>
<p></p>
<center>Why is it us searchers of knowledge are labeled hackers and thought to be malicious?</center>
<br>
<center>Why are we the first to blame when something goes wrong?</center>
<center>Is this just convienient for all those that dont understand us?</center>
<center>If you think about this most of you think of us &quot;Hackers&quot; as malicious and you may think we should be locked up for our sins.</center>
<br>
<br>
<center>But what are our sins?</center>
<center>Is it a sin that we want to learn?</center>
<center>Should learning now become grounds for punishments such as jail?</center>
<center>There is a difference between &quot;Hackers&quot; and &quot;Anarchists&quot;.</center>
<center>Hackers do not gain anything from causing chaos.</center>
<center>About 90% of the time the &quot;hackers&quot; are blamed for crashing servers and what have you.</center>
<center>But this is not the work of a true &quot;hacker&quot; this is the work of a &quot;Anarchist&quot;.</center>
<br>
<br>
<center>Anarchists thrive on destruction, they are not interested in learning.</center>
<center>So now can you tell me why us &quot;Hackers&quot; are always to blame?</center>
