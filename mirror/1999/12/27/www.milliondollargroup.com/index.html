<p>Federal agencies have spent billions warding off potential Y2K disasters and, with only
four days remaining, are ready to face the music, public officials say. </p>

<p>At last count, 99.9 percent of the government's mission critical systems are ready for
potential Y2K related problems, the Office of Management and Budget has reported. OMB
estimates that the Y2K bug will end up costing the government more than $8 billion over a
four-year period. </p>

<p>Of the government's 6,100 mission-critical systems, only eight are still not compliant&#151;six
in the Defense Department and two in the Justice Department. Of those eight systems, four
are being replaced, three are being repaired, and one is being retired. Fixes to the
systems are scheduled to be finished in the next few days, before the date rollover. </p>

<p>Several federal agencies have been in the spotlight because they offer services that
impact millions of citizens. At the Department of Labor, all systems that support
unemployment insurance are Y2K ready, and the Agriculture Department's child nutrition
programs have been compliant since December 15. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, &quot;the planes are not going to fall out of the sky,&quot; Federal
Aviation Administration chief Jane Garvey said in an interview with <i>GovExec.com</i>.
Garvey will be on a plane to California during the Y2K changeover. &quot;We simply
wouldn't let planes take off if we thought there were safety issues,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>At the Pentagon, nuclear weapons systems are 100 percent compliant. Defense Department
officials will sit side by side with Russian counterparts in Colorado to monitor the U.S.
early warning system against missile attacks. </p>

<p>And the federal Y2K Council, the group set up to monitor and coordinate the
governmentwide Y2K effort, is ready too. Beginning today, the council's Web site, <a
href="http://www.y2k.gov">www.y2k.gov</a>, will begin releasing information from its
Information Coordination Center, including press releases, transcripts of press briefings,
and bulletins on the status of systems in major industry sectors, such as power and
transportation. </p>

<p>John Koskinen, the government's Y2K czar, is confident in the hard work that federal
agencies have put in to defeat the Y2K bug, but warns that problems will not end on Jan.
2. </p>

<p>&quot;Y2K challenges can happen any time a computer that is not Y2K-compliant comes
into contact with a Year 2000 date&#151;before or after January 1,&quot; Koskinen said at
a recent press briefing. </p>

can fight other country's.&nbsp; I think first they need to get war off the street.
&nbsp; All the gov. thinks about is war with other country's.&nbsp; But if they keep
acting like this there is going to be a war from with-in and not from the outside.</b></p>
