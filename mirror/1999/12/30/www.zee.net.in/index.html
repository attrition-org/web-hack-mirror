<p><font color="#FFFFCC">Only countries with gays in their army "protecting"
their nation by running in the other direction let their hijacked planes
take off their soil !!</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFCC">Let us share with you, something we came across
recently :</font>
<p><font color="#CCFFFF">With their current "anti Pakistan and their agencies"
hysteria of the Indian media they want you to believe that every aspect
of their life is infiltrated by ISI. Having thought about it carefully
I came to the conclusion that yes maybe they are right. The following is
an example of how an ordinary Indian's day is disrupted by ISI:</font>
<p><font color="#CCFFFF">- He wakes up early in the morning and stumbles
across the room to watch the sun rise, but there are clouds in the sky
blocking his view. Obviously ISI are the culprits as they want him to feel
depressed, so they sent clouds over India at sun rise.</font>
<p><font color="#CCFFFF">- He than makes his way to the bathroom and starts
shaving. What's this, his face gets cut by the blade. Surely ISI must have
planted a rogue blade in his bathroom in order to make his life miserable
early in the morning.</font>
<p><font color="#CCFFFF">- Having survived two assaults by this terrorist
organisation he leaves for work and asks his wife to lock all the doors
and baricade herself in the house just in case there is an ISI agent around
who might sneak into the house and sabotage it.</font>
<p><font color="#CCFFFF">- He than discovers another nefarious plot by
the notorious ISI --- all the public transport whether they be buses or
trains are overflowing with commuters. Obviously these commuters are ISI
plants to stop him from getting to his workplace and contributing to the
welfare of his country.</font>
<p><font color="#CCFFFF">- He reaches his workplace after a great effort
and discovers that ISI has struck again. There is no elctricity and therfore
he cannot carry out his duties. Another clever plot by ISI to sabotage
his great nation.</font>
<p><font color="#CCFFFF">- He staggers to lunch during the afternoon but
feels drowsy after the meal. Wants to sleep instead of work. What did the
ISI put in his food?</font>
<p><font color="#CCFFFF">- On the way back he discovers that the commuter
conspiracy is again at work.</font>
<p><font color="#CCFFFF">- Finally he arrives home, his children give him
their school report. What, they are not doing well at school. Realises
that ISI has infiltrated the education system as well and now are out to
destroy the education of the children by sending such reports to parents.</font>
<p><font color="#CCFFFF">- Night falls, he goes to bed, hears a thump outside
his bedroom, looks out of the bedroom window ----- ISI ----- life goes
on.</font>
