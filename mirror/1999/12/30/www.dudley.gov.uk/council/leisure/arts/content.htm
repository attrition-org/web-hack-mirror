AND ENTERTAINMENT EVENTS</strong> </a></font></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">The Section promotes a programme of professional performing
arts events, known as Dudley Winter Season, which runs from October to March each year.
Our current Season features performances by Joe Pasquale, Helen Shapiro, Jethro, CBSO,
Voulez Vous, and many more. Further details of the 1999/2000 Season, including how to
book, can be viewed on the <a target="_self" href="../../../whatson/dudentertain/content.htm">Dudley Winter Entertainment Season Live!
1999-2000</a> web site. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Arts Officers assist with the organisation of <a href="../../../whatson/dac/content.htm" target="_self">Dudley Arts Council</a>, the
organisation which represents the amateur arts societies in the Borough. Many of these
groups stage shows, concerts, exhibitions, pantomimes and other events. Dudley Arts
Council produces a quarterly Arts Listings brochure giving details of these. This
information can be viewed on the <a target="_self" href="../../../whatson/dudentertain/content.htm">Dudley Winter Entertainment Season Live!
1999-2000</a> web site.</font></small></p>

organisations for various events, including concerts, tea dances, ballroom dances,
exhibitions, meetings, tutorials, prayer groups, slimming clubs, dance classes and more.
You can find out what's going on at the Borough's Halls in the <a target="_self" href="../../../whatson/dudentertain/content.htm">Dudley Winter Entertainment Season Live!

</strong></font></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Arts Officers are involved in a wide range of arts
development projects, providing arts activities for members of the community.&nbsp; Dudley
MBC subscribes to West Midlands Arts, and is in regular contact with WMA Officers. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">The Inter-Departmental Arts Team meets regularly, with
members from Education, Social Services, Community and Lifelong Learning and the
Museums/Art Gallery. This group jointly produced the Borough Arts Strategy, setting goals
for artistic activity within Dudley. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">The Arts Forum is a group made up of Councillors and
representatives from Council Departments and various arts &amp; community organisations.
It meets to discuss various issues concerning the arts. Past meetings have focussed on the
arts and healthcare, the amateur arts and public art. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Arts Officers have been involved in successful drama and
dance projects. Black Country Touring is an organisation initiated by Arts Officers from
the Black Country boroughs. It offers small scale touring drama productions for all kinds
of venues in the Black Country. The Dudley Dance Consortium is a collaboration between
Arts Officers from Planning and Leisure and the Community and Lifelong Learning Unit. A
successful lottery bid means that a Dance Artist is due to be appointed, to initiate dance
work with communities in Dudley. Open Stage is a drama group for young people with
learning disabilities. Arts Officers were involved in devising this successful group,
together with colleagues from CLLU, Priority Health, Social Services and Education. </font></small></p>

Development work.</font></small></p>
