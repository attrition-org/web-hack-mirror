you, and to the formalities, which are necessary. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Arial">Within the Borough we can offer you the services of two very
different register offices, one located in the 19th century Priory Hall and the other a
modern, bright, purpose built marriage suite. The staff can offer you various enhancements
to your ceremony. Descriptions of their facilities and the suggested enhancements are
described here. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Arial">Dudley Council is committed to a high standard of service and
customer care. We pride ourselves on excellent facilities in our register offices and a
high degree of expertise from our staff, to ensure that your wedding will be a joyful and
memorable occasion for you, your family and friends. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Arial">Marriage Ceremonies are performed at Dudley and Stourbridge Register
Offices on Mondays to Fridays from 10am to 12 noon and 2pm to 4pm. On Saturdays, marriages
take place from 10am to 12.30pm. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Arial">Out of respect for all marriage parties who use our facilities,
guests are asked not to smoke in the register office, and to wait until they are outside
the building before throwing confetti or rice. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">If you both live in the Dudley Borough but depending on
your residence, you must give notice at one of the following offices: </font></p>

entrance suitable for wheelchair and/or pushchair access. There are also toilet facilities

<p><font face="Arial">We have a choice of two ceremonies. You may choose between these.
When you come to the office we can show you the choice of words. We work on the principle
that &quot;it's your wedding, not ours&quot;. Whatever you choose you can be sure that our
staff will help make a success of your wedding as we have confidence and pride in our
service. We want to make a celebration of your marriage, not just solemnise your civil
marriage contract. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If you have a reading that you would like one of your guests to
read, this is welcomed and encouraged, providing it has no religious content or
connection. Alternatively, staff would be willing to read for you if you wish. We can also

marriage will see the two of your privately, to check the particulars which are to be
entered in the Marriage Register. At this time the Registrar will also obtain the fee from
you. Meanwhile the guests are asked to wait in the marriage reception area and, when
requested, enter the Marriage Suite. </font></p>

solemn and binding nature of the Marriage Ceremony. </font></p>

of any lawful reason to prevent your marriage, repeating the following words after the
Superintendent Registrar: </font></p>

why I . . . (your full name) may not be joined in matrimony to . . .&quot; (full name of
your fiancé/ee). </font></p>

Registrar: </font></p>

do take thee . . . to be my lawful wedded wife/husband&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You have both made the declarations prescribed by law and have made
a solemn and binding contract. You are now husband and wife together. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">After the ceremony the Registrar will make the entry in the register
and ask you both to check its correctness. You and your witnesses then sign the register,
the bride signing in the surname she has been known by immediately before the marriage.
The witnesses must be able to understand the marriage ceremony. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Before you can marry in a register office in England or Wales, you
must give notice of your intention to marry. You can give notice in two ways, depending on
how quickly you want to be married and how long you have lived at your home address. You
cannot give more than three months notice to get married. The notice is a legal statement
that must be signed by you or the person you are marrying. You cannot ask a relative or
friend to give the notice for you. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You may choose to marry in any register office in England or Wales
even though you may not be resident in your chosen district. Most register offices will
now accept a provisional booking up to 12 months in advance of your wedding date. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To arrange a provisional booking, you should contact the office of
your choice, but you MUST still give notice of marrying in the district(s) where you live.
This must be given no more than three months in advance of your wedding. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There are two different options for giving your notice. By
'Certificate without Licence' or 'Certificate and Licence'. </font></p>

seven days before the date you give notice of your marriage. It does not matter if either
of you moves to a different address after the notice has been given. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If you live in a different district to the person you are marrying,
you can marry in the register office for either district. Or you can marry in any other
register office in England or Wales. If you choose to marry in another register office,
you must give notice of your marriage in the districts where you both live. But first, you

<p><font face="Arial">This is a more expensive option, but couples often choose it as
there is less travelling around between register offices. The following conditions apply
if you give notice by 'Certificate and Licence'. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You and the person you are marrying must have lived in England or
Wales for the 15 days before the date you give the notice. The other person must be in
England or Wales on the day the notice is given. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The marriage can either take place in the office where you give
notice or in any other register office of your choice. It does not matter if either of you
moves to another address after the notice has been given. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">With this type of notice, you only have to wait one working day
before the marriage can take place. If you are not getting married in the district where
you gave notice, you can collect the authority for the marriage (the licence) from there
after one working day and take it to the other district. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You only have to give one notice if you get married by 'Certificate
and Licence'. So it doesn't matter if you live in a different district from the person you
are marrying. Also, this notice is not put up for display to the public. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A fee will be charged for giving notice and for the issue of your
licence. Please telephone for details. </font></p>

'Certificate and Licence'. You can only get married in a church in a different district to
where you both live if either of you usually go to worship in that building. You may also
get married in another district if there is no building of your religion in the district
where you or the person you are marrying lives. Our staff will be glad to give you help
and advice on this matter. </font></p>

temporary or moveable structures such as marquees or boats. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To arrange a wedding at an approved venue, you must first contact
the venue to make provisional arrangements. Then you must contact the register office of
the district in which the venue is located to ensure that Registration Officers can attend
your wedding on the date and time of your choice. </font></p>

where you live and you will have to give your Marriage Authority or Authorities to the
