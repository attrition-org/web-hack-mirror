</P>
<P><I>"Carers are relatives, friends or neighbours who look after someone who cannot manage without help, because of sickness, age or disability."
Carers National Association</I></P>

<P>Carers are ordinary people of every age, race, class and religion.  Some carers look after someone for a few hours per week, while others care for 24 hours per day, every day.
</P>
<P>Many carers care in their own home, while others support relatives and friends who might live nearby or many miles away.
</P>
<P>Carers look after people of all ages and may be any age themselves, from young people at school through to people in their 90s.

<P></B><FONT SIZE="+1">Partnership with Carers</FONT><B>
</P>
<P>Dudley Social Services Department knows that carers have a very important part to play in looking after people.  Our aim is to work in partnership with carers to offer practical assistance in caring and a respite period (break from caring).  We recognise and value the work that carers do to support the person that they care for.  Caring can be very rewarding, but it can also bring problems, like exhaustion and stress, financial difficulty, loneliness and isolation.  
</P>
<P>Dudley Social Services Department can assess your needs to establish what help we can offer.
</P>
<HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="100%">
<P></B><FONT SIZE="+1">How can we Help?</FONT><B>
</P>
<P>When a member of Social Services staff visits the person you are looking after, this is called an Assessment of Needs.  Any difficulties that you are facing can also be discussed at this point.</P>

<P>A Care Plan will be put together with yourself and the person that you are caring for, as well as anyone else who gives support.  The plan will show how everyone will work together and what part each will play in the plan of care.  This plan works for you and the person you look after, and can be changed when the needs of the person you care for change.

<P></B><FONT SIZE="+1">The Carers (Recognition and Services)  Act 1996</FONT><B>
</P>
<P>It is our aim to consider the needs of carers as well as and separate from the person for whom they care.
</P>
<P>We can provide information about what help or services may be available.
</P>
<P>The Act requires that, as part of an assessment of an individual requiring community care, the Social Services Department must, if requested by the carer, assess that carer's ability to provide and continue providing care. The Department will then  take the results of this assessment into account in making decisions about community care services.

</P>
<P><I>How can I get help to look after the person that I care for?</I>
</P>
<P>First of all get in touch with your local Social Services Area Office.  Social Services staff can discuss the needs of the person that you care for, and any help you both feel is needed.  This is called a Community Care Assessment.</P>
<P><I>How can I get practical help at home?</I>
</P>
<P>Although looking after someone is rewarding, sometimes it can be tiring and stressful.  Help may be available to provide personal care for the person you look after.  Help may be given within the home, or it may be possible to arrange for the person you are looking after to be cared for outside the home, either in day care or a care home.
</P>
<P><I>How can I get some time for myself?</I>
</P>
<P>Caring can be a full time job.  Many carers need a break called respite care.  This allows you some time alone to pursue your own interests, or to "recharge your batteries".  Again, contact your local Area Office who will be able to offer help and advice.
</P>
<P><I>What will make my daily care routines easier?</I>
</P>
<P>Our Occupational Therapists can give practical advice about all aspects of daily living.  There is a wide range of equipment available and house adaptations can sometimes be arranged to make a home a safer and more convenient place in which to care for someone.
</P>
<P><I>Will there be a charge for these services?</I>
</P>
<P>There may be a charge for some services, this will depend on the financial situation of the person for whom you care. This will be explained to you.
</P>
<P><I>What happens if I feel I can't carry on looking after the person that I care for?</I>
</P>
<P>Sometimes you may feel unable to go on looking after the person you care for.  Carers may feel worried, lonely or isolated.  Other long term arrangements may need to be thought about.  Dudley Social Services Department would be happy to discuss any concerns that you may have.
</P>
<P><I>How can I get the information or advice that I need?</I>
</P>

We know that Carers need a lot of information about what help is available and where to get it.
