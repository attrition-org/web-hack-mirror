    <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>How the Service is Delivered </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Broadly, the Department is divided into four
    interdependent working Divisions. These are:</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial"> </font><ol>
      <li><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Adult Care Division</i>, which is responsible for
        assessing the help adults and their carers may need, by deciding if they are eligible for
        a service, making arrangements for the appropriate services to be purchased from the
        public or private sectors, and reviewing how successfully the services have been in
        meeting individual's needs.<br>
        The Division is also responsible for planning and developing services for adults who are
        older, have mental health problems, have physical or sensory impairment or learning
        disabilities, by producing planning documents in collaboration with other agencies, and
        commissioning new services to meet changing needs.<br>
        <br>
        </font></b></li>
      <li><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Children and Families Division</i>, which is
        responsible for assessing the help needed for children and their families, including Child
        Protection and Youth Justice, by deciding if a child &quot;is in need&quot;, making
        arrangements to provide services appropriate to meet those needs, and finally, to review
        over time how successfully the services have been in meeting needs.<br>
        The Division is also responsible for planning and developing children's and families
        services, by producing planning documents in collaboration with other agencies, and
        commissioning new services to meet changing needs.<br>
        <br>
        </font></b></li>
      <li><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Direct Care Services</i>, which is responsible for the
        managment and delivery of the Department's in-house service provision for both adults and
        children and families. This covers 46 teams and establishments including residential
        homes, day centres, SECs, home care, transport, delivery of Meals on Wheels, respite care,
        family placements, specialist services for children with disabilities, young people
        leaving care, family support and education support.<br>
        The Division aims to meet the needs of individual service users reliably and promptly and
        to be flexible and responsive to changing needs and the requirements of the Adult Care and
        Children and Families Divisions. Services are developed in collaboration with these
        Divisions and other agencies through a three year business plan and service level
        agreements for particular services.<br>

      <li><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Business Services</i>, which is responsible for
        providing support to practitioner and managerial staff throughout the Department to ensure
        high quality services are delivered. The Division provides the following: personnel
        services; training and staff counselling facilities; management of the capital programme,
        health and safety practices and accommodation issues; financial services, managerial
        information and public information service; interpreting and translation service: and the
        resources for developing information systems and strategies.<br>
        As well as the above, the Division carries departmental lead for corporate policy
        development, coordinating the response to national regulatory and statutory requirements,
