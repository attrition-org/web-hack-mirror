<P>Dudley's Community Care Charter sets out the standards of community care services to Dudley residents, and has been produced by staff working for Dudley Council and Dudley Health Authority, with the assistance of local residents and representatives from local voluntary organisations.
</P>

<P>Dudley's Community Care Charter is an important contribution to ensuring that community care services are of a high standar, within the budgets available, and that users of services and carers know by what standards services are being provided.  We are eager to ensure that the Charter plays its part in promoting good quality services.  It is published as a companion document to <A HREF="../planning/ccp/ccp.htm" TARGET="_self">Dudley's Community Care Plan</A>, which describes the intentions of Dudley Council and Dudley Health Authority to improve community care services now and in the future.

<B> Putting Users and Carers First</B>

<P>Dudley Council and Dudley Health Authority are committed to putting users of services and their carers first in ensuring high quality community care services.  This is achieved by users and carers being actively involved in decideing what services will be provided to meet their needs, and helpin to determine the planning of services for the future by commenting on the quality and usefulness of services they receive.
</P>

We aim to ensure that users and carers:


<UL>
<LI> Are fully consulted at all times on the services being offered to meet their needs.
<LI> Have an active say in the way services are provided, and are involved in discussion to improve services.
<LI> Are properly informed of choices they have about the range of services available, who can receive them, how and where to get them, and what conditions or charges there may be.
<LI> Are involved in influencing the services they receive through being consulted on the planning, delivery and evaluation os services.
<LI> Receive a high qulaity service from staff by ensuring that all staff conduct themselves properly, courteously, respecting peoples' dignity and independence, and treating all information confidentially.
<LI> Are treated with equal consideration regardless of race, religion, sex, language, financial circustances, disability, sexuality, culture and where they live in the borough of Dudley.
<LI> Receive a service from staff who have the appropritae knowledeg, skills and competence to carry out their responsibilities, and have the training and management support needed to provide a good quality service.
<LI> All staff with responsibility for Community Care Services will carry and Identification Card, to be shown on request.
</UL>
<P>These standards apply to all of the services provided through Dudley Council and through contracts with Dudley Helath Authority.
