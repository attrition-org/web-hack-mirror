<p><small>A Corporate Complaints Procedure was introduced in October 1992 in order that
people wishing to comment or complain about a Council service should know how to go about
it, and so that staff should be clear about how they should respond. Members may be asked
by members of the public for assistance on this.</small></p>

<p><small>The Council tries to provide good services to the people of the Dudley Borough.
But there may be times when things go wrong. When this happens customers are left unhappy
or dissatisfied with the service that has been provided. The Council wants to hear from
such customers and has produced a leaflet which explains to members of the public how to
make a complaint and what will happen to it. A copy of this leaflet is available from
reception areas in all departments. Basically, complaints should be referred to the
Department concerned, where they will be investigated. If complainants are dissatisfied
with the Department's response they can refer the matter to the Chief Executive, who will
arrange for the issues to be investigated further. In difficult and complex cases the
Chief Executive is able to take advice from a small number of leading Members who may be
asked to give a final adjudication. Should the complainants still be dissatisfied with the
outcome they can refer the matter to the <a href="obudman.htm" target="_self">Local
Ombudsman</a>.</small></p>

<p><small>The Council is required by law to establish a procedure for considering
representations (including complaints) in relation to its social services functions. A
leaflet outlining how this particular complaints procedure works is available from the <a href="../../council/soc_serv/content.htm" target="_self">Social Services Department.</a></small></p>
