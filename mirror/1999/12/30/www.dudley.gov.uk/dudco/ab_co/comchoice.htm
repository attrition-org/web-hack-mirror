      <li><small>By improving our understanding of what the public want we can make sure that our
        services achieve the best value possible - giving them the quality of services they seek
        at a cost they feel is reasonable.</small></li>
      <li><small>To help us plan for the future. Whether it is for issues that affect the whole
        Borough, or more local areas, or communities, we can use the Panel as a way of improving
        the extent of public influence on future decisions in the Borough.</small></li>
      <li><small>There will be regular reports produced to explain what the Panel feel, and also
        To show what changes have happened as a result.</small></li>

    Panel is managed correctly, and who will produce independent reports on the survey
