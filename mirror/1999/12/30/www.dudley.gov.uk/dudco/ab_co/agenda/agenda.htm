<p><font color="#444444" size="2" face="Arial">The Dudley Borough
Agenda is the Council's key strategy statement for the next five
years. It sets out the principles and values that give the
Council its focus and direction, highlights the key pressures the
Borough faces, and proposes key priorities for action. It was
first produced and launched in 1996 and is intended to provide an
overview of Dudley Council's assessment of the problems,
challenges and opportunities facing the Borough over the next
five years. More detailed plans and strategies are also produced
that provide the background to the Agenda, such as the Unitary
Development Plan, Community Care Plan and Housing Strategy. </font></p>

Action </font></p>

<p><font color="#444444" size="2" face="Arial">Within the Agenda,
Dudley Council sets out its key principles for action. It states
that the Council is: </font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font color="#444444" size="2" face="Arial">proud of the
        Borough, its people and its unique character </font></li>

        carry into the future the history, traditions and
        landscape that has shaped the Borough </font></li>
    <li><font color="#444444" size="2" face="Arial">keen to
        sustain the best in the Borough - and striving to improve
        the less good </font></li>
    <li><font color="#444444" size="2" face="Arial">supportive of
        all the communities in the Borough - whether communities

        local democracy and its own leadership in the communities
        it serves as well as amongst other service providers<br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font color="#444444" size="2" face="Arial">pragmatic:
        willing - within its overall strategy - to seize
        opportunities as they arise </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font color="#444444" size="2" face="Arial">In providing

describe the key issues which need to be addressed over the 5
year period, these are: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#444444" size="2" face="Arial">ECONOMIC
        VITALITY - Fostering a climate in which jobs can be
        created, new skills promoted and developed and a diverse
        local economy sustained. </font></li>
    <li><font color="#444444" size="2" face="Arial">PERSONAL WELL
        BEING - providing services and opportunities that improve
        the quality of life local people enjoy, including their
        health and social care, their safety, their ability to
        exercise self determination and choice, achieve personal
        development and equal access to opportunities and
        services. </font></li>
    <li><font color="#444444" size="2" face="Arial">LIFETIME
        LEARNING - Lifetime learning enables people in the
        Borough, through access to education, learning and, in
        the broadest sense, cultural opportunities, to make
        choices in their lives, become empowered and able to
        change and seize new opportunities as they arise. </font></li>
    <li><font color="#444444" size="2" face="Arial">ENVIRONMENT -
        managing land and environmental issues to balance all
        needs, ensuring that people can have decent homes,
        opportunities for investment are created, Local Agenda 21
        targets are achieved and people have access to
        recreational opportunities. </font></li>
</ul>
