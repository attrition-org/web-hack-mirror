1999/2000</strong></font></a></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Council Tax to increase by 4.7%. For over four out of five
Borough Council Tax payers, the increase will be less than 60 pence per week.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Maintaining the Council's existing policies in 1999/2000
would cost £251.8million. The Government sets the amounts councils may spend above which
council tax benefit subsidy would be lost - for Dudley this is just under £246 million.
This target will be met by making 'good housekeeping' savings of £1.1 million and using
£6.1 million from Council balances <em>(available because of careful financial management
over the years)</em>. This leaves £1.3 million available for a package of increased
funding for key priority services .</font></small> 

<ul>
  <li><small><font face="Arial">an extra £500,000 for Education to support Early Years
    Development, Behaviour Support, and improving teaching and learning through use of
    information Communication Technology.</font></small></li>
  <li><small><font face="Arial">an extra £300,000 for Social Services - more for Home Care,
    Social Work Assessment, Youth Offending Teams,and initiatives with Health and the
    voluntary sector.</font></small></li>
  <li><small><font face="Arial">an extra £300,000 to improve the quality of cleanliness
    through out the Borough.</font></small></li>
  <li><small><font face="Arial">an extra £50,000 for Lifelong Learning - to increase out
    reach work and independent advice to learners.</font></small></li>
  <li><small><font face="Arial">an extra £ 1 50,000 towards the development and regeneration
    of our town centres, and to encourage inward investment into the Borough.</font></small></li>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Published Audit Commission figures show Dudley to be the best
performing metropolitan authority in the country in terms of collecting local taxes. This
has been achieved through a combination of a high collection rate and low collection
costs. Local tax payers can be assured that Dudley Council is determined to collect all
taxes due from all those who are liable to pay.</font></small></p>

promptly. Your co-operation helps keep to a minimum the amount of Tax you pay.</strong></em></font></p>
