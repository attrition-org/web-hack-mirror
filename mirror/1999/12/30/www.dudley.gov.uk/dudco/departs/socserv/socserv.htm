</b><small>Whilst the Department concerns itself with all aspects of social care, its main
aim is to arrange and provide support and care services for those people and their carers
who, for various reasons, are vulnerable or at risk. In doing this, the objective is to
ensure that people in the Borough receive the best services which can be provided within
available resources. This includes services for older people, children in need, people
with mental health problems, people with a physical or sensory impairment and people with
a learning disability. </small></font></p>
