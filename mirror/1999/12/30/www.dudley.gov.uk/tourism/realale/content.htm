<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>The Black Country is renowned for
its real ales and for its characterful pubs.&nbsp; A few of these remain more or less
unaltered since Victorian times; others have been modernised but still retain their
essential character; yet others have become part of the various national real ale theme
pubs.</strong></font></p>

<p><strong><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The traditions of real cask ale
brewing (especially 'mild ale') and 'local' pub values have survived longer in the Black
Country than in other parts of the country - and prices are usually much lower!</font></strong></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>In the Dudley Borough there are two
independent brewers and one brew-pub:- <a href="http://www.dudley-gateway.co.uk/bathpage/index.htm" target="_top">Batham's</a> at
The Delph, Brierley Hill and Holden's at Woodsetton and the Sarah Hughes Brewery at
Sedgley which brews for its taphouse, the Beacon Hotel, and a few free-trade
outlets.&nbsp; The leading regional brewer is Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries trading
as Banks's and Hanson's.&nbsp; Other nearby breweries are the Highgate &amp; Walsall
Brewery in Walsall and in the countryside west of Stourbridge the Enville Brewery which
supplies several pubs in the Borough.</strong></font></p>

<p><strong><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#0000A0">BRIERLEY HILL</font></strong><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><br>
The Delph, to the south of the town centre, has acquired the reputation of being the 'real
ales riviera' of Dudley with a series of pubs within walking distance of each other.
&nbsp; The famous flight of canal locks known locally as the 'Ninelocks' even though there
are now only eight runs parallel to the road and provides a pleasant walk through a
conservation area.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The pubs are (from the bottom next to the
canal lock) The Bell, The Tenth Lock, The Dock &amp; Iron, The Black Horse and the most
famous of all the<a href="http://www.dudley-gateway.co.uk/bathpage/index.htm" target="_top"> Batham's</a> brewery tap The Vine.&nbsp; This is widely known as the 'Bull
and Bladder' - although why this is so is a matter for some debate.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#0000A0"><strong><br>
DUDLEY TOWN CENTRE</strong></font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><br>
The Full Moon in the High Street is a J.D. Wetherspoon establishment.&nbsp; Further up the
street is the Little Barrel - a tiny town centre pub with a varying range of beers. &nbsp;
The Lamp Tavern at the top of the High Street (across King Street) is another of the
'Batham's nine' and the Saracen's Head in Stone Street was once one of the leading
coaching hotels in the town.</font></p>

Right on the western rural edge of the Black Country is one of the most famous pubs in the
country:- the Crooked House.&nbsp; This pub, now owned by Banks's, suffered from the
effects of coal mining in the 19th century so that the entire building subsided to an
amazing angle.&nbsp; Here even a teetotaller is likely to stagger.&nbsp; Well known
optical illusions include a ball that rolls uphill.&nbsp; It gets very busy on fine summer
weekends and evenings.&nbsp; </font><strong><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><em>Click

<p><strong><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#0000A0"><br>
HALESOWEN</font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><br>
</strong>There are two notable pubs on the Stourbridge Road out of the town centre:- the
Waggon &amp; Horses is described as 'a mecca for real ale drinkers' with its 14
ever-changing beers and the unusually named King Edward VII further along the road has
Enville ales and guest beers.</font></p>

<p><strong><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#0000A0"><br>
NETHERTON</font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><br>
</strong>The Old Swan (Ma Pardoe's) in Halesowen Road was once one of only four home-brew
pubs surviving in Britain.&nbsp; Alas, brewing ceased several years ago but the original
bar with its enamel ceiling and 'central heating' stove have been kept. <br>
<a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/dave_mellor/publdd.htm" target="_top">The
Little Dry Dock Inn</a> at Windmill End is one of the Little Pub Company extravaganzas
with part of a canal boat serving as a bar.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#0000A0"><br>
<small>SEDGLEY</small></font><br>
</strong><small>The Beacon Hotel along Bilston Street is a resurrected Victorian brewery
where the Sarah Hughes ales are produced by her grandson.&nbsp; Parties can book trips
around the brewery.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#0000A0"><br>
<small>STOURBRIDGE</small></font><br>
</strong><small>The Hogshead in Foster Street is the local representative of the national
chain and it has a range of guest beers.&nbsp; The Seven Stars in Brook Road, Oldswinford
next to Stourbridge Junction Station has a good range of beers and is worth visiting to
see the ornately tiled bar with its imposing mahogany and mirrors at the back of the bar.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#0000A0"><br>
<small>UPPER GORNAL</small></font><br>
</strong><small>The Britannia in Kent Street has been extended and refurbished in recent
years but the original tap room where both the customers and the staff are 'behind the
bar' has been kept.&nbsp; Brewing in the minute brewery at the back was restarted but
following the recent sale to Batham's may not continue.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#0000A0"><br>
<small>WOLLASTON</small></font><br>
</strong><small>This village right on the edge of the countryside is noted locally for
having at least eight pubs (depending on how you define the area).&nbsp; Three of them,
all on the main Bridgnorth Road, feature in the Good Beer Guide:- the Plough which has
Bass and Enville Ale, the Princess which has Wadsworth 6X and a range of Gibbs Mew beers
and the Unicorn which has Batham's beers.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#0000A0"><br>
<small>WOODSETTON</small></font><br>
</strong><small>The Park Inn is the Holden's brewery tap now extended by the addition of a
large conservatory.</small></font></p>
