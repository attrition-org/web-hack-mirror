<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The glass industry in the Stourbridge
area dates back to the 17th century when refugee 'gentlemen glassmakers' from Lorraine
settled here attracted by the abundant supplies of coal and clay for their melting pots.
At first they made window glass and bottles but in the 18th century following the
invention of lead glass they began producing the tableware and ornamental glass for which
Stourbridge has become world-famous.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The golden age of the Stourbridge glass
industry was the 19th century when many new firms were established and new colours and
decorating techniques pioneered locally. Today the glass industry is much less extensive
than it was, with a handful of factories still operating on their historic sites. These
include Royal Brierley Crystal, Royal Doulton Crystal and Stuart Crystal.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Arial"><b>Broadfield House Glass Museum</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The museum tells the story of the
historic Stourbridge glass industry. The displays show glass from Roman times but the
emphasis is on the cut, etched, engraved and coloured glass which made the name of
Stourbridge world famous. The fabulous cameo vases carved by Alphonse Lechevrel can be
seen together with the work of other renowned craftsmen. The technology and techniques of
glassmaking are explained and illustrated.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>This museum is on the same site as
Stuart Crystal and is centred on the 100 feet high cone which was the original glassworks.
These were once common in this district but now this is one of only four left in the
entire country and it is the only one open to the public. Restoration as a working glass
museum is under way but the restored cone and the adjacent canal wharf can be explored.</b></font></p>
