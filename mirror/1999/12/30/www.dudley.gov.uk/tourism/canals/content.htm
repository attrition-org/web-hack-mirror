canals include a fascinating network of junctions and branches. There is a wealth of
features of interest to canal enthusiasts and industrial archaeologists: locks, bridges
and warehouses. Commercial carrying has long since gone from these waters leaving them to
be enjoyed by walkers and boaters. The scenery varies from industrial sections to
surprisingly secluded rural lengths.<br>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="3" face="Arial"><b>IN THE PAST</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>These canals played a key part in
bringing the Industrial Revolution into what was then rather remote country in south
Staffordshire and north Worcestershire situated on the watershed of England and thus
distant from navigable rivers. Cheap bulk transport allowed the mineral resources of the
area, above all coal, to be exploited to the full. Ironworks, brickworks, glassworks and
many other industries proliferated amongst coalmines, claypits and limestone quarries;
creating the 'Black Country'. The Stourbridge and Dudley Canals were cut in the late 18th
century to link with the Staffs &amp; Worcester Canal to the west and the Birmingham Canal
Navigations system ('BCN' to the enthusiasts) to the east and thus become a part of the
national network of waterways. The traffic was so great that the old Dudley Tunnel became
a bottleneck and was supplemented by a new line of canal, the Dudley No. 2 Canal which
originally took a short cut to join the national system at Selly Oak south of Birmingham.
This route also had the advantage of avoiding the Birmingham Canal Company's notoriously
high tolls! However even this was insufficient and in 1859 a new double width tunnel was
driven through the Rowley Hills at Netherton - the last canal tunnel to be built in
Britain until the Dudley Canal tunnel was extended into the Singing Cavern in 1984. In
addition to the main lines of these canals there were many branches and hundreds of basins
and docks serving canalside factories. Most of these have now gone as have many of the
factories themselves.</b></font></p>

WALKERS, CYCLISTS AND ANGLERS</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The canals provide interesting, peaceful
and traffic-free routes around the area. At several places the canals link with other
walks and trails around the open spaces of Dudley. Some of these are indicated on the map
and referred to in the text. These canals are now home to an increasing variety of
wildlife. With the decline of industry the quality of the water has improved greatly and
many stretches have good stocks of roach, perch, bream and other coarse fish. Information
about angling permits may be obtained from British Waterways Fisheries Officer at Fradley,
Telephone (01283) 791395. There is no charge to walkers but cyclists require an annual
permit obtainable from British Waterways, Auchinleck House, Five Ways, Birmingham,

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="3" face="Arial"><b>FOR BOATERS</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The Dudley and Stourbridge Canals form
part of two cruising circuits shown on the location map below. One, via Wolverhampton and
the Staffs &amp; Worcester Canal and the other via the River Severn and the Worcester
&amp; Birmingham Canal returning north through Birmingham city centre. These make a
pleasant (and energetic!) combination of attractive rural and urban sections. Both 'rings'
take several days to complete.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial"><b>There are a number of highlights on the canals,
including the ones listed below.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="3" face="Arial"><b>1. THE BONDED WAREHOUSE AND STOURBRIDGE
ARM</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The end of the Stourbridge Arm is
dominated by the restored Bonded Warehouse. This was built in 1779, extended in 1849, and
is now a popular meeting place for local societies and other groups. Overlooking the end
of the canal is the Moorings Tavern which has a small beer garden. Across the street are
the former offices of the Stourbridge Canal Company. Moorings for boats extend along the
canal. Beyond them are the historic Stourbridge Ironworks where the Stourbridge Lion - the
first locomotive to run on rails in America and the Agenoria, the first in the midlands, -
were both built in 1829. At the bend in the canal the remains of the railway from the
wharf to the 'New Foundry' behind the Ironworks can be seen as well as 'Riverside', once
the home of the manager of the ironworks. There is an interesting short walk along the
canal to the junction which continues to the East as the Stour Valley Walk. At the
warehouse there are moorings for visiting boats, a water point and winding hole. The town
centre of Stourbridge is only a few minutes away. </b></font></p>

<p><b><font color="#0000A0" size="3" face="Arial">2. WORDSLEY DOCK</font><font color="#000000" size="1" face="Arial"> </font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>From Stourbridge the canal climbs 145
feet up the hill towards Dudley through a flight of sixteen locks. Between locks 11 and 12
is a basin with wharves and an unusual timber warehouse built by the canal company in the
late l9th century. There is another basin and a side pond above lock 11 next to a row of
old cottages. The next locks up are known as 'The Staircase' as they are so close
together. There is an old iron split bridge (to allow the rope between boat and horse to
pass through) giving access to the attractive lock cottage. This area with its pleasing
setting was designated as a Conservation Area in 1977. Just below it the Red House glass
cone has its own wharf. The cone is open to the public free of charge. The cone is one of
only four left in the country although they were once a familiar sight in the surrounding
glassmaking district.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="3" face="Arial"><b>3. FENS POOLS</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The canal is not navigable above The
Leys Junction but the towpath provides a pleasant walk. The remains of the former
Stourbridge Extension Canal which used to run to the long-gone Oak Farm Ironworks near the
'Crooked House' pub can be seen on the north side of the canal. Across the main road the
section of canal is known as the 'Wide Waters' and at its head are the three Fens Pools.
The Pensnett Railway Walk crosses the surrounding open space and continues via Hunts Mill
to Holbeach where it connects with the Kingswinford Railway Walk which, in turn, passes
through Wombourne and on to Wolverhampton.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="3" face="Arial"><b>4. DELPH LOCKS</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>Black Delph marked the division between
the Stourbridge Canal to the south and the Dudley Canal to the north and was therefore
technically a 'junction' although this is not apparent since the canals run straight into
each other! The impressive flight of locks climbing straight up the hill are part of the
Dudley Canal and are known locally as the 'Ninelocks'; another apparent mystery since
boaters will be pleased to discover that there are only eight. The original locks built in
1779 by Thomas Dadford, engineer to the Dudley Canal Company, are just south of the
present line - their remains can be seen among the trees and grassland. Mining of the
Thick Coal seam caused massive subsidence and in 1856 these locks had to be replaced. The
old top and bottom locks were kept but the remainder were superseded by six new locks
hence the eight locks in existence today. Half way up there is a block of stables once
used for boat horses and nearby, alongside the old canal, the former lock keeper's cottage
can be seen. Delph Road which crosses the canal below the locks has been described as the
'real ales riviera' of Dudley due to the number and variety of the pubs along its length
as it runs parallel to the canal.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="3" face="Arial"><b>5. PARKHEAD</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>At Parkhead Junction the original canal
continues up the locks and under the railway viaduct to enter the low portal of the Dudley
Tunnel (no towpath). At the top of the locks the remains of the Earl of Dudley's private
canal - the Pensnett Canal - can be seen and there is also a monument in the form of a
tunnel ventilation shaft to commemorate the reopening of the tunnel in 1973. At the
junction itself, next to the former pumping engine house, the Dudley No.2 Canal branches
off and is now the main through route.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="3" face="Arial"><b>6. SALTWELLS NATURE RESERVE</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The 115 acres include Saltwells Wood and
the former Doulton's Claypit - now a site of considerable botanical interest. The
Blackbrook Valley Walk which follows the canal for most of its way from Parkhead here
departs through the Reserve to end south of Mushroom Green near the end of the Stour
Valley Walk. There are several pleasant walks through the heath and woodland and also
around the adjacent Lodge Farm Reservoir. This used to supply the canal but is now used
for sailing and water-skiing. The canal skirts the Reserve and passes through a deep
cutting which was originally a tunnel, hence its name - 'Brewin's Tunnel' - Brewin being a
former engineer to the canal company. Near the 'High' or 'Sounding Bridge' the remains of
a short canal arm can be seen where the clay from the pits used to be loaded onto boats.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="3" face="Arial"><b>7. WITHYMOOR BASIN</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The arm is all that remains of the once
busy transshipment basin where goods were transferred from canal to railway. It is now
used for moorings and the surroundings have been landscaped and thickly planted with
trees.</b></font></p>

<p><b><font color="#0000A0" size="3" face="Arial">8. WINDMILL END</font><font color="#000000" size="1" face="Arial"> </font></b></p>

<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">When Netherton Tunnel was built to
relieve the traffic- choked Dudley Tunnel the canal was straightened. The loop of the
canal now forms two arms each spanned by a bridge carrying the towpath across as are the
Netherton Tunnel Branch and what used to be the main line running down to Halesowen. These
elegant black and white bridges are a striking feature of Windmill End. The tunnel was a
marvel in its heyday - lit by gas and having two towpaths so boats could pass. Walking
through is not really recommended - the scenery is remarkably monotonous for 3,027 yards!
The open grassland running up to the top of the Rowley Hills presents a very different
scene from that of its industrial heyday. Then the hillside was covered with mineshafts,
spoil heaps and coke ovens whilst inclines and railways criss-crossed the area to carry
the coal down to the still visible canal basins. The ruins of Cobb's engine house just
south of the tunnel portal are a reminder of the past. Near the canal junction was a
railway station, next to it a hotel and the grimy hamlet of Windmill End itself. Now a
small housing estate and a couple of pubs stand next to acres of grassland dotted with
clumps of small trees. One of the pubs is the eccentric 'Dry Dock' where the front half of
a narrow boat forms the bar - this is the home of 'Desperate Dan' cow pies</font><font color="#000000" size="1" face="Arial">.</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="3" face="Arial"><b>9. HAWNE BASIN AND THE LEASOWES</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>From Windmill End the canal runs along
the side of the Rowley Hills with extensive views over this part of the Black Country.
Emerging from the short Gosty Hill Tunnel (no towpath) the canal passes through the former
tube works and now ends at Hawne Basin where there are moorings. Originally the canal
continued on to Selly Oak passing through the notoriously long and narrow Lapal Tunnel. It
was the repeated collapse of sections of this tunnel that resulted in the remainder of the
canal being closed in 1917. A short unnavigable length remains in the Leasowes Park. The
canal embankment here closed off the view from the poet William Shenstone's famous
landscaped gardens in 1797. Dudley Council is restoring the grounds but in the meantime
there are still many pleasant strolls alongside the streams running through the woods. The
more energetic can follow the series of footpaths which lead south to Illey and Lapal (not
shown on the map). The now disused section of the canal that runs from Hawne Basin to
Selly Oak is currently the under gradual renovation by the <a href="http://www.eeap.aston.ac.uk/pjb/lapal/" target="_top">Lapal Canal Trust</a>. </b></font></p>

<p><b><font color="#0000A0" size="3" face="Arial">10. THE <a href="http://www.bclm.co.uk">BLACK
COUNTRY MUSEUM</a> AND DUDLEY TUNNEL</font><font color="#000000" size="4" face="Arial"> </font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The Museum includes a Black Country
village reconstructed and furnished as it would have been at the turn of the century; a
replica of the famous Newcomen steam engine which was built nearby in 1712; a convincing
and exciting replica of a Black Country coal mine, and trams and trolley buses. The canal
interest includes an old time boatyard which is still used and an unusual lifting bridge
across the arm which runs into the village. There are boat trips from the wharf into the
Dudley tunnel with its impressive open air basins and rock-lined sections. Even more
impressive is the 'Singing Cavern', a disused limestone mine reached by new tunnels
constructed in 1984 and 1989. The main Dudley Tunnel runs for nearly two miles beneath the
town centre to Parkhead. Visiting boats may moor at the Black Country Museum but the crew
will not escape the normal admission charges! There is no access from the towpath so
walkers have to make their way to the main entrance in Tipton Road.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="3" face="Arial"><b>11. COSELEY STOP AND TUNNEL</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The first canal between Wolverhampton
and Birmingham (the Old Main Line) followed the contours to reduce the number of locks and
in the course of its wanderings reach as many collieries and ironworks as possible. In the
early 19th century Thomas Telford was called in to build the New Main Line which by means
of embankments and tunnels took a much more direct route. At Coseley the line was reduced
by several miles by tunnelling through the hill. The 360 yards-long tunnel has a towpath
through it. South of the tunnel is a surprisingly green and secluded cutting where short
stay moorings for boats have been provided and named 'Coseley Stop'. A 'stop' was a place
where the working boatmen would moor overnight, usually near pubs and shops, as here at
Coseley.</b></font></p>
