<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>Dudley Borough's manufacturing base
shrank by 19% between 1981 and 1991, while service activities grew by 27% over the same
period. In the last 10 to 15 years the economy of Dudley has continued to diversify. Apart
from the Merry Hill shopping centre, there is now a significant office campus development
known as the Waterfront. Forty-four service sector companies have moved to the Waterfront
employing around 3,000 people. Also, about 70 overseas-owned companies have been
identified in Dudley Borough. Over the 3 years: 1994, 1995 and 1996, twelve of the 24 new
investment projects in Dudley were overseas in origin. Dudley's largest employers (in
terms of numbers of employees in Dudley) include the Local Authority, the Health
Authority, Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries, Dudley Police and British Steel.</b></font></p>

Many of Dudley's characteristics, eg: unemployment, socio-economic profile, deprivation
etc. closely match the national average - in fact the Borough appears to be less deprived
than the national average according to the DoE Index of Local Conditions. However this is
a misleading picture which masks great variation within the Borough. While the south and
west fringes are relatively affluent, localised deprivation exists, and some of Dudley's
enumeration districts are among the most deprived in the country.</b></font></p>
