<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The modern Borough of Dudley was a
recent creation comprising the local districts of: <a href="#Halesowen">Halesowen</a>, <a href="#Kingswinford">Kingswinford</a>, <a href="#Sedgley">Sedgley</a>, <a href="#Stourbridge">Stourbridge</a> and <a href="#Dudley">Dudley</a> itself.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The one thing that all of these
disparate places had in common were the minerals that lay beneath them: coal, iron ore,
limestone, fireclay and sand. The use of these materials for manufacturing during the
industrialisation of great Britain was enormous. A factor that gave rise to the name The
Black Country.<br>

<p><a name="Dudley"><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Dudley</strong></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>Even in the medieval period Dudley was
the centre of a large area. From Dudley Castle the barons ruled over a sizeable proportion
of the West Midlands. The most long lasting of their creations was the Market Town of
Dudley itself.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The earliest recorded use of the
plentiful mineral supply was also in the middle ages. Later Dud Dudley, an illegitimate
son of one of the barons, was one of the first ironmasters to forsake charcoal to use coal
(coke) for smelting iron ore. This was taken up by another Dudley man - Abraham Darby who
perfected the process in Coalbrookdale.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The industrial history of the area can
be experienced in the Black Country Museum which was built on old coal pits and at a
junction of the canal system.</b></font></p>

<hr size="1" align="left">

<p><a name="Halesowen"><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Halesowen</strong></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>Originally the centre of an enormous
parish that from the 13th century was occupied by the Premonstratensian order of canons of
St Mary's Abbey. The Market Town of Halesowen was close to the crossing of the River Stour
and above it soared the tower (and later spire) of the magnificent church of St John the
Baptist.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>From the 17th century the chief trade
was manufacturing nails and other metal objects. During the 17th century Civil War local
iron masters supplied the shot to the royalist garrison at Dudley Castle. Only a handful
of the traditional Nail and Chain Shops still survive.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>William Shenstone, the poet and
landscape gardener, was born in the 18th century at the Leasowes, Halesowen. William's
natural landscaping techniques turned the streams, woodlands and fields of his farm into a
national wonder.</b></font></p>

<hr size="1" align="left">

<p><a name="Kingswinford"><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Kingswinford</strong></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>As its name suggests this was a royal
estate. The scattered communities of this parish gleaned what they could from an area
sandwiched between Pensnett Chase and the Forest of Kinver. The original village centre
was close to the Church of St Mary. The Court House (now a Pub) and the Village Pound
still stands close by.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The Chase, as a source of minerals and
iron-ore deposits, was mined as early as the 13th century. The township of Brierley Hill,
Pensnett and Quarry Bank owe their origins to the settlements of miners and charcoal
burners within the area.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>With the arrival of French glassmakers
in the early 17th century Amblecote and Wordsley with Brierley Hill became centres of the
Glass Industry. The Red House Cone in Wordsley is the last of the traditional glass works.
Some of the finer pieces produced by this trade can be seen at the Broadfield House Glass
Museum.</b></font></p>

<p><a name="Stourbridge"><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Stourbridge</strong></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The Market Town of Stourbridge, situated
within the parish of Oldswinford, as the name implies, it is located at the river crossing
over the River Stour. Wool and leather were its staple trades in the medieval and
post-medieval period, but these were quickly overtaken by the iron industry.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The ironmasters, the Foley family, began
their rise to fame and fortune in the town. They once lived at The Talbot Hotel, a fine
building of the 17th and 18th century. They also founded the Old Swinford Hospital School,
which still exists to the present day.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The first locomotive to be run in the
United States of America - the Stourbridge Lion and the first to be run in the Midlands,
the Agenoria, were manufactured by John Rastrick's Old Foundry in Stourbridge in 1820.</b></font></p>

<hr size="1" align="left">

<p><a name="Sedgley"><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Sedgley</strong></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>The highest point of this scattered
parish is Sedgley Beacon. The village place-name, Gornal - quern corner, suggest that
quarrying of the sandstone began well over a thousand years ago. Apart from building
stone, the most famous of these were the white sandstone quarries of Ruiton; the sand
being used to scatter on floors.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>Wrens Nest National Nature Reserve was
another kind of quarry - this time limestone, used as a flux in smelting iron ore. The
Silurian limestone is well known for being the most fossilarious of all the world's rocks.
Many of the fossil species, like the Dudley Bug (calymene blumenbachii) are only found in
the Borough.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>When the quarries were worked out deep
caverns like The Severn Sisters and Dark Cavern, followed the startigraphy into the
ground. A subterranean canal system evolved to remove the stone, joining the surface
canals of the Black Country. The canal system which cut across the watershed of England
included the longest navigable canal in the country, the 18th century Dudley Canal.</b></font></p>
