<p><a href="map.jpg" target="_top"><img src="mapsm.jpg" alt="Site map and details" border="2" align="right" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="104"></a><small><font face="Arial">Dudley is currently seeking to have
its twin limestone hills, Wrens Nest and Castle Hill and their surrounds included on a
&#145;Tentative List&#146; of British World Heritage sites.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Dudley, however, was <b>not</b> included on a short list of
thirty two sites announced in August 1998 by the UK government&#146;s Department of
Culture, Media and Sport.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Dudley MBC believes that this exclusion is not justified
given Dudley&#146;s unique geological, historical and industrial heritage.</font></small><a href="7sis.jpg"><img src="7sissm.jpg" alt="Seven Sisters, Wren's Nest" border="2" align="right" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="64"></a></p>

status. You are invited to judge Dudley's merit for yourself and, if you agree it is
worthy of this designation, you are urged to contact the DCMS in support of our bid. A

<p><small><font face="Arial">Wren's Nest and Castle Hill contain superb exposures of
middle Silurian (Wenlock and lower Ludlow series) rocks, including <b>a definitive section
through the Much Wenlock Limestone Formation.</font></small></p>
</b>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Wren's Nest was designated <b>Britain's first National Nature
Reserve for Geology</b> in 1956, and is a premier educational site for teaching the
principles of stratigraphy and palaeoecology.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Around and between the hills lie Middle Carboniferous
(Westphalian) strata, including the South Staffordshire Thick Coal; at 9-12.8 metres, <b>the
thickest coal seam in the British Isles.</font></small></p>

<p></i></b><small><font face="Arial">The Wenlock Limestone of Dudley <b>contains the most
diverse and abundant fossil fauna in the British Isles</b>: over 600 species of marine
invertebrate, representing<i><b> </b></i>some 29 major taxonomic groups.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">The Wenlock Limestone of Dudley is a <b>fossil lagerstatten</b>,
containing rare and important <b>life assemblages</b>, in the form of beds of articulated
crinoids (sea lilies) superbly preserved under deposits of terrigenous mud and volcanic
clay. Rare annelid (worm) and early plant remains have been found, containing <b>soft
tissue</b>.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">The site is the <b>type locality</b> for 186 species (more
than any other British site); 63 of these recorded nowhere else. Many new species,
particularly of microfossils, have yet to be described.</font></small></p>

the most perfectly preserved Silurian fossils in the world.</b> This is reflected in the
fact that they have always been highly valued and are found in countless museum
collections and displays across the globe.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Other superlative features of the site include bioherms
(fossil &#145;patch&#146; reefs preserved 'in situ'), and expansive ripple beds, which
provide evidence of littoral zone conditions.</font></small></p>

were cited by the celebrated 19<sup>th</sup> century geologist Sir Roderick Murchison to
help define the Wenlock series in his seminal work <i>The Silurian System </i>(1839).</font></small></p>
</b>

<p><small><font face="Arial">65% of the Wenlock fossil species described and figured by
Murchison in his <i>magnum opus</i> were from Dudley.</font></small></p>
<b>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Wenlock fossils from Dudley are figured in hundreds of
scientific and popular publications</b> including monographs and treatise.</font></small></p>
<b>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Abraham Darby, father of the Industrial Revolution, was born
on Wren's Nest </b>in 1678. A forerunner of the coking process, devised by Darby to turn
coal into coke, had been developed earlier (in the1620s) by Dud Dudley, son of the local
Baron of Dudley. His work was abandoned due to violent protests from local charcoal
burners who feared their livelihoods were threatened.</font></small><b></p>

their surrounds provided the raw materials to establish Dudley as the centre of what
became known as the &#145;Black Country&#146;, the <b>Cradle of the Industrial Revolution.
</b>The<b> </b>juxtaposition of materials for the manufacture of iron &#150; coal,
ironstone, limestone - together with fireclay, are unique to the area. </font></small></p>

subterranean canal tunnels. These were connected to the national canal system by the
Dudley Tunnel, the earliest<b> narrowboat canal tunnel in the world. </b>Built in 1784, at
just over a mile long, it cuts the English watershed and when first built was the longest
canal tunnel in England.</small></font></p>
<b>

<p><small><font face="Arial">The Newcomen &#145;Atmospheric&#146; Engine, the world&#146;s
first commercial steam engine, was erected near Castle Hill in 1712. </b>It pumped water
from coal mines, allowing miners to excavate from ever increasing depths, and led to
further development with steam power. This included the work of Richard Trevithick, James
Watt, William Murdock and George Stephenson.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">The trilobite fossil <i>Calymene blumenbachii</i> is so
common in the local rocks that it was adopted as the symbol of the limestone mining
industry and appeared in the centre of the town's coat of arms. It is more widely known by
its nickname <b>the 'Dudley Locust' or 'Dudley Bug'.</b></font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Sir Roderick Murchison visited Dudley in 1839 and 1849 to
address members of the British Association inside Dark Cavern &#150; by gaslight. An
estimated 15,000 people attended each event, with Murchison being acclaimed <b>'King of
Siluria' at Wren's Nest. </b>These remarkable events have since become part of both local
and scientific 'lore'.</font></small></p>

a museum of buildings which celebrates the industrial past of the region. Built on the
site of 18<sup>th</sup> century collieries and at the entrance to the underground canal
system, it utilises many original industrial features. These include 18<sup>th</sup>
century mine shafts, mid 19<sup>th</sup> century giant draw kilns, and accompanying canal
basins and tunnels.</font></small></p>
