<center>On Dec 6 '99, at 8 am Oktyabrskiy and Staropromislovskiy districts
of Grozny, the capital
<br>of the Chechen Republic, were shelled with special chemical bombs,
which release
<br>clouds of inflammable gas creating massive blasts that incinerate buildings
and people.
<br>37 people have died, more than 200 people were injured and wounded
as the
<br>result of this unhuman attack, forbidden by all possible International
treaties.
<br>The first victims were 47 years old Marat Irischanov and his 15 years
old daughter
<br>Zina. The number of victims is rising every minute.
<br>There was unusual yellow light, that could be seen throughout the city
after the
<br>chemical attack by russians.
<br>---
<br>This is a war Putin and Yeltsin dare not lose. Huge resources have
been deployed
<br>- crack troops paid premium wages, high-tech equipment, total air and
artillery
<br>superiority to achieve a "bloodless" victory - bloodless for the Russian
army. It is
<br>the civilian population that is taking the heaviest casualties.
<br>However the budget of Russian Federation is unable to sustain a long
and
<br>expensive high tech war in Chechnya. For Yeltsin and Putin the war
is a desperate
<br>gamble - a throw on which they are staking all. Key parliamentary and
presidential
<br>elections are looming. Putin, Boris Yeltsin's designated heir, hopes
to guarantee
<br>the succession by a total victory over the Chechens.
<br>Russians are using barbaric weapons against civilians. Chechen cities
(there are
<br>only three of them) and villages are being completely destroyed. Chechen
nation
<br>faces the danger of being wiped out. In short, <b>all relevant norms
of</b>
<br><b>international law are being violated by Russia</b>. More precisely,
<b>there
is</b>
<br><b>genocide of Chechen nation</b>.
<br>Unwillingly, one will come to the conclusion that the law of jungle
governs
<br>Russian-Chechen relations and the West's attitude to them. Most ironic
thing in
<br>this is that just recently the West, including the UN talked so much
about the
<br>rights and freedoms of ethical minorities and upheld these rights in
Kosovo and
<br>Estern Timor. Almost all of us were made to believe that at least international
<br>humanitarian law was superior to both the principle of sovereignty
and the
<br>principle of non-intervention in ‘domestic’ affairs of a sovereign
state.
<br>What is then so special about Chechens? Is a life of a Chechen child
is somehow
<br>less worthy than a life of a child of other nation? Or do Chechens
love their
<br>families, their women, their land, their beliefs less than other nations
do?
<br>It's time to stop russian invasion into a foreign state and stop russian
atrocities!
<br>It's time for the World Community to wake up! It's time to say to russians:
"Ivan -
<br>Domoi!", which can be translated as "Ivan - Go Home!".
