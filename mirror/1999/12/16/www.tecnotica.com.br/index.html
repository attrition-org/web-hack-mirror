		Dear visitor of this site. I welcome you on the new intro page. This is just temporary,
		because your admin was to lazy to secure the system as usual. Everyone has seen YTcracker, fuqrag, Flipz and
		other a-like-hackers. The messages from <I>Pr1sm</I> showed on <A HREF="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/1999/12/11/www.resconet.com/">
		Attrition</A> are the right words for their response on the media. Now hackers are blamed to crazy people that are drunken and deface pages of high
		profile site's. I hope they will quit the lame stuff and learn to hack and not to deface! Response on the
		message from <I>Pr1sm</I>.

		Anyone I not wrote above made their self conclusion! Maybe you will see yourself in the mirror and say: "Why
		have I done this? Where is the target of it? Is it good for the opinion, public?"<BR>

<p align="center">Admin: mail me and I'll tell you what's wrong</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">TELETUBBIES.<br>
We watch the TV and think it's fake,<br>
a world of splendor,<br>
full of wealth,<br>
and all people are in good health,<br>
A utopia for all to be seen<br>
through a transparent screen.<br>
we think we are real.<br>
Someone's watching us though.<br>
We think we rule the world.<br>
But like we kill fly's,<br>
they can kill us with a blink of their eyes.<br>
We have no respect for we don't seem them.<br>
some call em gods,<br>
depicted with electric rods.<br>
Some call them &quot;rulers&quot;,<br>
guides.<br>
But we are just entertainment,<br>
for the powers above<br>
we are adorable and create a feeling of love.<br>
Long live the teletubbies,<br>
because we're the humantubbies.<br>
And as soon as they came extinct,<br>
we will too.<br>
