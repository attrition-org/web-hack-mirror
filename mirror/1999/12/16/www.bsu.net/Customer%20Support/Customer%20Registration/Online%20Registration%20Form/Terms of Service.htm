  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I will use BSU.NET services only for my own use,

  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I understand the Internet may contain materials
    which are unedited, offensive, etc. over which BSU.NET has no control or responsibility; </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I understand that the services BSU.NET provides to
    me may be withdrawn at any time without notice or cause; </font></li>

  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I understand that I will not engage in any illegal
    and/or unethical practices in conjunction with use of BSU.NET; </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I understand that BSU.NET may be subject to the
    various and changing laws and policy mandates by virtue of its association with Boise
    State University and the State of Idaho; </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I understand and agree to the following regarding
    security and privacy: electronic communication is not completely secure and private; in
    order to manage its network and facilities, BSU.NET will monitor traffic from time to
    time. However, BSU.NET will not intentionally monitor or disclose any private e-mail
    message unless permitted or required by law and/or Boise State University policy.
    Additional measures to enhance the security and privacy of communications, including but
    not limited to, the use of e-mail software encryption methods, are the sole responsibility
    of myself; </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I understand that I am using BSU.NET services at
    my own risk and that BSU.NET will periodically have downtime. BSU.NET will notify
    customers of maintenance by posting a message on its Home Page; </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I understand my account will be activated only
    after my fee payment&nbsp; is received for at least one semester service. I also
    understand that BSU.NET services are provided on an 'as-is' basis and that no refunds will
    be given for unused services and/or downtime; </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">To continue my BSU.NET services after the initial
    semester, I will be contributing a fee at the rate of $30 (thirty dollars) per semester
    (Fall and Spring), $10 (ten dollars) for summer, or $70 (seventy dollars) per year; </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The fee includes: 1) unlimited Internet service,

  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I understand that these terms of service may be
    modified and additional policies and acceptable use guidelines may be instituted by
    BSU.NET, to which I agree to abide for as long as I remain a client. I also understand
    that I may terminate service with BSU.NET at any time for any reason;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I understand that using BSU.NET services for the
    origination, forwarding, or sending of unsolicited, mass-mailed, or posted electronic
    messages (a.k.a. &quot;SPAM&quot;) will be grounds for immediate termination of my
    account, without refund for unused time and services;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I understand and acknowledge that this is not a
    dedicated (24-hour) connection. Users will be disconnected after 15 minutes of
    non-activity. Users must have at least a 1-hour logoff period after each 8-hours of
    continuous use. Any user on-line for more than 24-hours within a 27-hour period will be
    disabled for three concurrent, continuous hours;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I understand that these above terms are jointly
    binding on me, and furthermore, each of the above-mentioned policies and guidelines is
    binding on me by its own strength. In the event of unenforceability of any one of them,
    each and every one of the remaining policies and guidelines is still binding.</font></li>
