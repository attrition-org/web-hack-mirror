Well here we are again... another day another site. What can you make of this?
I know most of you out there probably don't have a good opinion about me, most 
of you other defacers probably hate me, especially YTCracker, well let me say 
this. I am not trying to aggrivate you or make you upset, I am just merely 
stating that if you did what you do for a good reason you may be more respected
among the scene. As for YTCracker, I do not hate you... I'm just telling you, 
the stuff you did didn't have much of a point, if you changed your act, you 
could be a value in the scene. Respect me or hate me, I'm not going anywhere 
until the scene is restored to what it used to be...
<p>
To the media (CNN, ZdNET, ParseTV, HNN, etc). You should examine what sort of 
message these people are providing and how they are doing what they are doing
before you make them into megamedia stars. By giving these people media
attention you are merely encouraging them to do more. People and groups like 
PHC, xoloth1 and team spl0it are those worthy of media attention for wise 
choices and good causes. Than again this is just my opinion, it's yours to 
decided what should and shouldn't get media... Well enough of this.
