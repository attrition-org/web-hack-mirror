<P>Hi.  Billy here.  As we last left my pony hacking crusade, we
<BR>discovered that the gothic band KoRn eats ponies because they don't like
<BR>themselves.  today, a new page was created in the pony saga.  You see,
<BR>i received an urgent letter from dr. timmy.  here is his letter:
<P>
"BILLY.  THIS IS DOCTOR TIMMY.  I HAVE MADE A SUPER IMPORTANT DISCOVERY
AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF YOUR PRECIOUS PONY, CHRISSY-POO.  YOU SEE, AFTER
PERFORMING SEVERAL SCIENTIFIC TESTS, MOSTLY ONES WHICH INVOLVE POURING
EGG WHITES ON MY WANGLYFLOP IN FRONT OF A BUNCH OF BLIND AND DEAF
CHILDREN, THEN SLAPPING THEM IN THE HEAD WITH IT, IT WAS MADE APPARENT TO
ME THAT NONE-OTHER THAN GAY MEN
WHO HAVE BEEN EATING PONIES EVERYWHERE, AND QUITE POSSIBLY YOUR PONY,
CHRISSY-POO. THAT'S
RIGHT, BILLY.  FRUITY
FRUITY MEN WHO WEAR SHORT SHORTS ARE PART OF A VAST GAY NETWORK.  TO BE
MORE SPECIFIC, GAYMEN
HAVE A TOP SECRET
UNDERGOUND ARMY OF DARK GAYNINJAS WHO SPEND ALL THEIR FREE TIME WANKING
OFF TO POKEMON TRADING CARDS. THEY KIDNAP PONIES FROM KIDS JUST
LIKE YOU, MURDER THEM, AND
MAKE SWEEET SWEEEEEEEEET LOVE TO THEIR STILL WARM CARCASSES, MUCH IN THE
SAME FASHION AS JEFFRY DAHMER (WHO HEADS UP THE GAYNINJAS ARMY).
I PRAY THAT THIS LETTER GETS YOU IN THE BEST OF SPIRITS.  WHY DON'T YOU
EVER RETURN MY 
CALLS?  DO YOU STILL LOVE ME?  OH YEAH AND MY PANTS ARE AT YOUR HOUSE, CAN I 
COME OVER AND PICK THEM UP?
<BR>NOTHIN BUT LOVE,
<P>DR. TIMMY, M.D."
