Well lately, coming from me and numerous others there has been a complaint about
kiddies running around defacing web sites for no reason at all. Well, as you can
see... nothing has changed in the past few days, kiddies are still ripping up
the pages with lame message. You might argue that this defacement has no point to 
it. Well let me tell you, this defacement is to show you who are the 'good guys' 
and the 'bad guys'. Below I will list nemuerous web page defacements done by
both of the good and bad people... This should give you an idea of what I mean when
I refer to these people as kiddies and that they have no apparent reason for defacing.
