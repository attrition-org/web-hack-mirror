    <p>The <font face="Bookman Old Style"><b>Arthritis National Research Foundation</b></font>
    provides funding for highly qualified researchers associated with major research
    institutes, universities and hospitals throughout the country seeking to discover new
    knowledge for the prevention, treatment and cure of arthritis and related rheumatic
    diseases. <i>The foundation receives no government funding; it operates solely through the

    <p>Since 1952, the <font face="Bookman Old Style"><strong>Arthritis National Research

    improved treatment and the ultimate cure of arthritis. Research breakthroughs resulting

      face="Times New Roman"> mission is to provide grant funds to young investigators studying
      the causes of and new treatments for arthritis. ANRF has called upon top researchers and
      scientists to become members of a newly formed Scientific Advisory Board. The doctors of
      the Scientific Advisory Board are respected nationwide for their individual expertise in
      the field of arthritis and immunological research.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The individual members of ANRF&#146;s Scientific Advisory
      Board have committed their expertise to furthering the principles and goals of our
      organization on a regular basis. These scientists believe that ANRF plays a critical role
      in the field of rheumatic disease research: the Foundation funds young investigators,
      often giving them a &quot;jump start&quot; on their research careers. The Advisory Board
      members will be reviewing the grant proposals received by ANRF each year and recommend
      grant recipients, as well as providing advice to the Board of Directors on the trends in
      research and clinical treatments.</font></p>
