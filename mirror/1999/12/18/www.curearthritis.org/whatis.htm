    <font FACE="Arial"><p>There are more than <b>100 types of arthritis</b> and treatment may
    be obtained from arthritis specialists called <i>rheumatologists</i>. Some of the most
    prevalent forms of <i>arthritis</i> include: <ul>
      <i>
      <li>Osteoarthritis </i>(occurs when the tissue that covers the joints breaks down and leaves
        the ends of the bones unprotected<i>),</i> which is the nation&#146;s number one crippling
        disease, affecting 17 million Americans </li>
      <i>
      <li>Rheumatoid Arthritis</i> (the most painful and crippling form), an autoimmune disease
        that afflicts approximately 7 million Americans </li>
      <i>
      <li>Spinal Arthritis</i>, which affects 2.5 million Americans </li>
      <i>
      <li>Gout</i>, which affects nearly 2 million Americans </li>
      <i>
      <li>Related Autoimmune Diseases, </i>such as<i> Systemic Lupus</i> <i>Erythematosus</i>
        (Lupus), that affect over 100,000 Americans</li>
      </font>

    microorganisms and cancer is the job of our immune system.</strong></font></p>
    <p></font><font FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000ff"><b>Rheumatoid Arthritis and Systemic Lupus
    Erythematosus are autoimmune diseases.</b></font></i><br>
    <font FACE="Arial">The immune system is composed of a family of cells and tissues that are
    distributed throughout the body. The cells of this system are also found in the blood and
    are called lymphoid cells or white blood cells. To be effective, the immune system must be
    able to distinguish &quot;foreign&quot; agents, termed antigens, from our own or
    &quot;self&quot; tissues. Normally, this system performs flawlessly and we recover from
    infectious disease and keep abnormal cancer cells under control. However, in certain
    individuals the immune system appears to make a mistake and identifies &quot;self&quot;
    tissues as &quot;foreign&quot; and attempts to destroy them.</p>
    <p>This unfortunate condition is termed <b>autoimmune disease</b> or attacking self
    tissues. Autoimmune diseases take many different forms, they may be &quot;localized&quot;
    and involve a single organ or tissue or they can be &quot;systemic&quot; and involve
    multiple organs and tissues. </p>
    <b><p>Rheumatoid arthritis</b> (RA) and <b>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</b> (SLE) are
    examples of systemic autoimmune diseases. They usually begin locally and then the tissue
    destruction and scarring progresses to include other organs and tissues. These are
    relentless, progressive diseases which are characterized by alternating periods of active
    tissue destruction and quiescent periods of repair and scarring. These diseases are
    debilitating, disfiguring and can be lethal. Both white blood cells and soluble proteins,
    termed antibodies, which are directed at self tissues are involved in causing this
    disease. The general therapy is to suppress the patient&#146;s immune system and slow the
    attacks on self tissues. </font></td>
