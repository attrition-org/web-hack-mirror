        Research Foundation. The Board of Directors is committed to increasing our annual income
        so that we are able to fund a greater number of promising young investigator&#146;s
        projects. In each of the last three years, we have met this goal.</font><p><font
        face="Times New Roman" size="3">The 1998-1999 grant recipients represent the best and
        brightest young scientists seeking to understand the nature and cause of arthritis. Most
        of these studies center around the autoimmune diseases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
        Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE or lupus). In autoimmune disease, the patient's immune
        system is attacking and destroying self-tissues. By studying the causes of these
        diseases, scientists will be able to devise new therapies to fight them at the cell level.
        In fact, we are beginning to see disease-modifying therapies, not just anti-inflammatory
        drugs to help control pain.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">One such new therapy for rheumatoid arthritis is
        a drug called &#147;Enbrel,&#148; which recently received FDA approval. The drug has been
        developed by the Immunex Corporation and has been tested in clinical trials across the
        country. Enbrel is a protein-based drug comprising only human amino acid sequences; in
        other words, substances already produced in the human body. The drug inhibits TNF (tumor
        necrosis factor) biological activity. In RA, excess TNF combines with cell-surface TNF
        receptors to produce a cascade of damaging and inflammatory effects on joints. Enbrel is
        thought to interfere specifically with the inflammatory process in RA, which is believed
        to be driven by TNF. (See page 5 for more information on Enbrel.)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">ANRF is proud of the research it funded in the
        1970's and 1980's which led to the original discovery of TNF, the target of these new
        therapies.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Scientific Advisory Board adds a new
        dimension to the scope and prestige of the Arthritis National Research Foundation. The
        collective expertise of these renowned scientists and physicians will help the Foundation
        expand its influence into the next century. The Board of Directors is indeed grateful for
        their commitment to the Foundation's goals: helping young investigators study the basic
        science of rheumatic diseases in an effort to develop new therapies and, ultimately, a
        cure.</font></p>

        face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Arthritis National Research Foundation has funded four
        scientific studies investigating the disease pathways that lead to the debilitating
        autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus (SLE) and scleroderma. The studies range
        from pinpointing the genetic make-up of cells susceptible to Rheumatoid Arthritis to
        understanding the human immune system¹s malfunctioning in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
        (SLE or Lupus).</font><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#147;Understanding the
        disease pathway is the first step toward determining the cause of the disease and,
        ultimately develop new therapies,&#148; said Gale A. Granger, Ph.D., Arthritis National
        Research Foundation president and Professor of Immunology at the University of California,
        Irvine. &#147;The four investigators receiving grants from ANRF this year exemplify the
        Foundation¹s dedication to studying why and how the body reacts as it does in the
        pathogenesis of these autoimmune diseases.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A normally functioning immune system enables us
        to recover from infections by releasing antibodies to attack foreign, unwanted substances.
        In Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Lupus, which are autoimmune diseases, this highly
        efficient immune system has made a mistake and is attacking &#147;self tissues.&#148;
        While not the most prevalent form of arthritis (osteoarthritis impacts over 17 million
        Americans), RA and Lupus are the most painful and crippling rheumatic diseases, affecting
        nearly eight million Americans.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The investigators awarded grants for the 1998-99
        grant cycle are:</font></p>

        Paul Utz, M.D., </strong>Harvard Medical School, Brigham &amp; Women&#146;s Hospital</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><em>Susan Kovats, Ph.D</em>., of the Beckman
        Research Institute at City of Hope in Duarte, California, received a $35,000 grant to
        study the nature of self-antigens (substances released by the body, as opposed to foreign
        substances, to stimulate production of antibodies) in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Her
        investigation will focus on whether tissue damage or infection confuse the recognition
        mechanism of the immune system, thereby attacking self-tissues as if they were foreign.
        &#147;Insights to these self-antigens will aid the design of strategies for therapeutic
        intervention in RA,&#148; said Dr. Kovats. Dr. Kovats received her Ph.D. from the
        University of Wisconsin in 1991, and is currently an Assistant Research Scientist in the
        Beckman Institute's Division of Immunology.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><em>Elizabeth Mellins, M.D</em>., at Stanford
        University Medical Center, received $40,000 to test the hypothesis that RA susceptible
        genes interact differently with key regulators in the RA disease pathway than do
        non-susceptible genes. Specifically, she will investigate if inherited genetic alterations
        in the recognition mechanism of the immune system are defective and cause the patient to
        identify certain self-antigens as foreign. This novel approach may yield insight into RA
        pathogenesis, providing fuel for new therapeutic strategies. Dr. Mellins is a practicing
        pediatric rheumatologist and an innovator in the field of antigen presentation. She
        received her M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1978 and has taught both Pediatrics and
        Rheumatology at the University of Washington, University of Pennsylvania and Stanford
        University Medical Center.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><em>Rebecca Tuetken, M.D., Ph.D</em>., at the
        University of Iowa, received $40,000 to study the mechanism of how the immune system
        recognizes and reacts against foreign and self-DNA (genetic information). This will help
        explain how certain patients with autoimmune diseases react against their own DNA.
        &#147;My hope is that this study will provide both a more complete understanding of the
        innate immune response to bacterial DNA and new insights in the pathogenesis of SLE,
        possibly leading to new therapeutic approaches,&#148; said Dr. Tuetken. Currently a
        post-doctoral fellow in Rheumatology at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Dr.
        Tuetken received her Ph.D. in Immunology and M.D. from the University of Chicago Pritzker
        School of Medicine in 1989 and 1991, respectively.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><em>Paul Utz, M.D.</em>, at Brigham and Women's
        Hospital (affiliated with Harvard Medical School) in Boston, received $40,000 to study
        cell death's role in the development of autoimmune diseases such as lupus and
        scleroderma. Dr. Utz's study will focus on the mechanism of how proteins released from
        dying self-cells can be modified and how these modified proteins then stimulate the
        patient's immune system. Once stimulated, the immune system will attack both dying and
        living cells to cause autoimmune disease.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Successful completion of this project may greatly
        advance the level of understanding of autoimmune disease mechanism. Dr. Utz is a
        practicing rheumatologist and instructor at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard
        Medical School, who received his M.D. in 1991 from Stanford University School of Medicine.</font></p>

        color="#400080">Enbrel: The Long-Awaited TNF Inhibitor is Available<br>
        </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The FDA recently licensed a genetically
        engineered protein that helps reduce symptoms of moderate to severe, active Rheumatoid
        Arthritis (RA). RA affects over two million Americans and is an autoimmune disease in
        which the body attacks self-tissues. The new treatment, called Enbrel, binds to the tumor
        necrosis factor (TNF), a naturally occurring protein in the body, and inhibits its action.
        TNF, which is believed to promote inflammation in the body, is found at elevated levels in
        the fluid surrounding the affected joints of RA patients. This is the breakthrough
        treatment referred to in the lead article of the last issue of CureArthritis. Now that the
        FDA has approved this treatment, Enbrel injections will be available through your
        physician.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Enbrel is an entirely new approach
        to the management of RA. It is the first in a new class of drugs known as biologic
        response modifiers, which specifically interrupt the inflammatory process. In clinical
        studies, patients taking Enbrel had significantly reduced pain and the number of swollen
        and tender joints. The drug is intended for those RA patients with moderate to severe RA
        who have not been able to achieve relief with one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic
        drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate. It may also be used in combination with
        methotrexate. Known side effects are: Mild to moderate injection site reactions. The
        long-term effects, on the development or course of serious infection, malignancy and
        autoimmune disease are unknown. Patients with a serious infection, or who are allergic to
        Enbrel or any of its components should not take this medicine.</font></p>

        <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In September, the FDA approved Arava (leflunomide)
        as a new treatment for adult RA. This drug, which is taken in tablet form, inhibits at
        least one enzyme in lymphocytes (cells of the immune system) and thereby interferes with
        the RA disease process. In clinical trials, patients taking Arava showed significant
        improvement in pain and swelling of joints and joint damage seemed to be retarded. Known
        side effects are: Not recommended for patients with significant liver disease, children,
        pregnant or nursing women. Patients may experience diarrhea or, rarely, liver problems,
        hair loss, skin rash or hypertension.</font></p>

        Cox-2 Inhibitors: Pain Relief without Stomach Upset</font><font face="Times New Roman"
        size="3"><br>
        As many as 107,000 hospitalizations and 16,500 deaths occur each year in the United States
        as a result of the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as
        ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin. These drugs help pain management of arthritis, but
        patients may develop moderate to severe gastrointestinal problems. One solution may be on
        the way. A new class of drugs is being developed by Searle, and also by Merck &amp; Co.
        These drugs are known as COX-2 inhibitors and are aimed at reducing the adverse effects on
        the gastrointestinal system. The preliminary results are promising: the drugs seem to
        target the COX-2 enzyme, produced primarily at the site of inflammation, while not
        inhibiting the COX-1 enzyme, which is needed for proper digestive function. It is the
        inhibition of COX-1, which is believed to be the cause of serious gastro-intestinal side
        effects, such as ulcers, which have been associated with the use of NSAIDs.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The review of Searle&#146;s Celebrex
        (celcoxib) is on the fast track at the FDA. The drug is still in the testing phase at this
        time. You can visit Searle at their web site to obtain current information:
        www.searlehealthnet.com. Vioxx is the Cox-2 inhibitor drug which Merck &amp; Co. is

        The FDA Gastroenterology and Urology Device Advisory Panel recommended approval for the
        treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis of Prosorba Column. This treatment
        has been used to treat Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), an immune blood
        disorder, since 1987. If final approval from the FDA is received, Prosorba Column would
        also be used to treat RA.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Prosorba Column is a treatment
        similar to kidney dialysis, in which blood is removed from the patient's arm and passed
        through a machine that separates the blood cells from the plasma. The plasma is then
        passed through the Prosorba Column, recombined with the blood cells and finally returned
        to the patient through the other arm.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In clinical trials across the
        country, patients who had failed with DMARDs (such as methotrexate) underwent 12 Prosorba
        Column treatments. Nearly half of these patients showed significant reduction in swollen
        and tender joint counts and the response was durable, some lasting as long as 75 weeks. </font></td>
