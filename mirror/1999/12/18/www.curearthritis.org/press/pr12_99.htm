          <p>The Arthritis National Research Foundation (ANRF) has funded five 
            scientific studies investigating how arthritis occurs in the body. 
            As the mechanisms of these diseases are more fully understood, new 
            and better therapies may be developed.</p>
          <p>Recently approved new treatments for arthritis have been the direct 
            result of such research. The new Cox-2 inhibitor drugs, Vioxx (Merck 
            & Co.) and Celebrex (Searle) are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
            (NSAIDs) intended to be gentler on the digestive tract. Scientists 
            isolated the specific enzyme which precipitates the inflammatory process 
            in osteoarthritis (known as Cox-2). These drugs target this specific 
            enzyme, but do not inhibit the other enzyme necessary for proper digestion 
            (known as Cox-1). "Pain relief with less stomach upset" is a tremendous 
            breakthrough for the millions who suffer the pain of arthritis every 
            day.</p>
          <p>The Arthritis National Research Foundation is committed to funding 
            the work of researchers developing new therapies intended to help 
            improve the quality of life for arthritis sufferers. Five young investigators 
            have received grants from ANRF this year:</p>

            Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized 
            by the progressive erosion of cartilage. Over 20 million Americans 
            suffer from this most prevalent form of arthritis. One of the most 
            profound, age-related changes in joint cartilage is the reduction 
            in the number of cartilage cells. In patients with osteoarthritis, 
            an increased number of cartilage cells undergo "cell death" without 
            adequate regeneration of new cells. Dr. Hashimoto's study will examine 
            the mechanism of cell death in OA and whether the inhibition of cell 
            death can be pursued as a novel approach to ameliorate cartilage degeneration.</p>
          <p><b><i>Yi Liu, Ph.D., University of Southern California</i></b><br>
            There are over 100 forms of arthritis. In many instances, patients 
            do not fully express the symptoms of one specific form, but have an 
            overlap of symptoms from two or more diseases. Fifteen to 25 percent 
            of patients referred to rheumatologists (medical doctors who specialize 
            in arthritis) with suspected systemic rheumatic diseases (such as 
            rheumatoid arthritis or lupus) fall in this category. This condition 
            of "overlap" is classified as undifferentiated connective tissue syndrome 
            (UCTS). Little is known at present about UCTS.</p>
          <p>Dr. Yi Liu has identified several UCTS patients with mutations in 
            the gene which has been identified as regulating cell death. His study 
            hypothesizes that defects in this gene may cause an impaired cell 
            death pathway which may contribute to the origination of the disease. 
            The identification of the mutations in this specific gene will mark 
            the beginning of understanding the disease pathway for patients with 
            undifferentiated connective tissue syndrome.</p>
          <p><b><i>Ae-Kyung Yi, Ph.D., University of Iowa</i></b><br>
            Many autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE 
            or lupus) and some types of arthritis, are thought to be triggered 
            by bacterial or viral infection. Bacterial DNA can be found in the 
            blood and synovial (joint) fluid of some arthritis and lupus patients. 
            Dr. Yi will investigate how bacterial DNA induces inflammatory responses 
            and interferes with autoimmune tolerance mechanisms. This study will 
            enhance the understanding of how the immune system reacts to bacterial 
            infection, which may lead to more specific new therapeutic approaches 
            for SLE and other autoimmune inflammatory diseases.</p>
          <p><b><i>Edward Treadwell, M.D., East Carolina University School of 
            Medicine<br>
            </i></b>Dr. Treadwell's study concentrates on understanding how specific 
            chemical compounds existing in pristane, which is found in mineral 
            oil and used for many food preparations, may cause systemic lupus 
            erythematosus (SLE or lupus). Lupus is an immune disorder which causes 
            the body to make an abnormal amount of antibodies, which protect against 
            viruses, cancer and other foreign agents which may enter and harm 
            the body. If Dr. Treadwell's study indicates that specific chemical 
            compounds can induce arthritis conditions like lupus, we can then 
            avoid or modify these compounds to potentially prevent diseases such 
            as lupus.</p>

            Veterinary Medicine</i></b><br>
            Injury and/or arthritis causes damage to articular cartilage in joints. 
            Cartilage is a highly differentiated and specialized cell type that 
            has almost no capacity for healing or replacing itself when seriously 
            injured. When this cartilage is lost, it is lost forever. One approach 
            to replacing lost cartilage has been to graft cells into the site 
            but, to date, this has met with limited success. In this study, researchers 
            will transfer a gene that stimulates the synthesis of cartilage components 
            into cells; these cells will then be grafted into a damaged joint. 
            The study will be done on horses; the large size of the horses' joints 
            will allow scientists to follow the progress of healing over time 
            by arthroscopy. Also, horses provide an excellent model because they 
            suffer similar clinical problems as humans. In addition, horses have 
            large joints, cartilage thickness and underlying bone, all of which 
            closely approximate those of humans.</p>
          <p>The Arthritis National Research Foundation has been funding arthritis 
            research since 1952. Based in Long Beach, California, ANRF disseminates 
            information to the public on current research through a periodic newsletter 
            and their web site, www.curearthritis.org. Grants are awarded on an 
            annual basis. Proposals are peer-reviewed by the ANRF Scientific Advisory 
            Board of Directors, nationally recognized expert scientists and physicians 
            in the field.</p>
