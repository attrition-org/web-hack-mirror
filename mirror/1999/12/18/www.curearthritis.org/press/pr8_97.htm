    <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The painstaking research continues as scientists worldwide
    seek to discover more effective treatments for the over 100 types of arthritis which
    affect one in seven Americans. Learning about the mechanisms in the human body which
    trigger these autoimmune diseases is one of the goals of The Arthritis National Research
    Foundation (ANRF). To that end, the Foundation has funded the work of three researchers
    for the 1997-98 grant cycle:</p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font FACE="Wingdings">n</font> Morteza Setareh, Ph.D., Scripps Research Institute</p>
    <p><font FACE="Wingdings">n</font> Arunan Kaliyaperumal, Ph.D., Northwestern University</p>
    <p><font FACE="Wingdings">n</font> Mariana Linker-Israeli, Ph.D., Cedars-Sinai Medical
    Center Research Institute, Los Angeles</b></p>
    <p><strong>Morteza Setareh, Ph.D.</strong>, a Postdoctoral Research Molecular Biologist at
    the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, received $38,000 for a project
    studying the molecular make-up of genes and the mechanism whereby an <i>autoimmune</i>
    response is triggered as in arthritis, lupus and other rheumatic diseases. The project
    involves identification and characterization of the molecular interaction of intracellular
    signaling proteins in the study of <i>aberrant T-Cell activation</i>, which has been shown
    to play a major role in triggering autoimmune diseases. With the information generated in
    the proposed work, Dr. Setareh believes they may be able to ultimately devise new
    therapies targeted at the signaling </p>
    <p>molecules. Understanding the regulation of these intracellular proteins is the key area
    for mapping the intricate events leading to the abnormal function of T cells.</p>
    <p>Dr. Setareh received his Ph.D. from the University of Arizona in 1993 and is currently
    finishing his postdoctoral training in Dr. Martin Lotz&#146;s laboratory at the Scripps
    Research Institute.</p>
    <p><strong>Arunan Kaliyaperumal, Ph.D.</strong>, of the McGaw Medical Center of
    Northwestern University in Chicago, received $38,000 to study the etiologic mechanism of
    Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE or Lupus) and design an autoantigen-specific therapy to
    block the autoimmune response in Lupus. These theories will be tested in the laboratory
    using lupus-prone mice.</p>
    <p>Dr. Kaliyaperumal received his Ph.D. in 1992 at the National Institute of Immunology
    (India), was a Research Associate from 1992-94 at the University of Chicago (Dr. Jeffrey
    Bluestone&#146;s laboratory) and, currently, is a Research Associate at Northwestern
    University in Dr. Syamal Datta&#146;s laboratory.</p>
    <p><strong>Mariana Linker-Israeli, Ph.D.</strong>, of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in
    Los Angeles, received $38,000 for a project examining the cellular and molecular
    characteristics of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE or Lupus). The multiple
    genes that are involved in Lupus have yet to be defined. By identifying the pathogenic
    factors in Lupus and by studying the susceptibility genes involved, Dr. Linker-Israeli
    hopes to devise screening methods and targeted regimens of therapy.</p>
    <p>Dr. Linker-Israeli received her Ph.D. in 1972 from the Weizman Institute of Science,
    did Postdoctoral work at Cal Tech, was a Research Associate at the University of Southern
    California and, currently, is an Adjunct Associate Professor of Medicine at UCLA. </p>
    <p>The Arthritis National Research Foundation has been funding arthritis and rheumatic
    disease research since 1952. Based in Long Beach, California, ANRF disseminates
    information to the public and physicians on current research through a quarterly
    newsletter. Grants are awarded on an annual basis. Proposals are peer-reviewed by the
    Medical Committee of the Board of Directors, as well as NIH-level expert scientists and
    physicians in the field. </p>
    <p>&quot;The Arthritis National Research Foundation is extremely proud to fund such
    worthwhile scientists who are studying the causes of and new therapies for these
    autoimmune diseases,&quot; said ANRF Board President, Gale Granger, Ph.D., of the
    University of California, Irvine.</p>
