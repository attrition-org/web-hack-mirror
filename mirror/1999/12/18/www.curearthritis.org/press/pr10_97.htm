    Rheumatoid Arthritis</strong></font></p>
    <font FACE="Arial"><p>LONG BEACH, CALIF. -- Thirty years of painstaking research has
    recently produced a promising new treatment to reduce the inflammatory symptoms of
    rheumatoid arthritis (the degeneration of joint tissues). </p>
    <p>Rheumatoid arthritis is one of the most debilitating and painful forms of arthritis,
    affecting over two million Americans. The new therapy utilizes a substance produced in the
    body to block the activity of the chemical produced by the autoimmune response. It is this
    autoimmune reaction which leads to the joint tissue degeneration associated with this
    disease. Reduction of the inflammatory symptoms of the disease means relief from painful,
    swollen and tender joints and, as a result, increased mobility.</p>
    <p>Autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus,
    commonly known as lupus, are illnesses which occur when body tissues are mistakenly
    attacked by its own immune system. According to an article in the July 17, 1997 <i>New
    England Journal of Medicine</i>, the new therapy is currently being tested on rheumatoid
    arthritis sufferers at arthritis research centers nationwide. The initial results have
    shown a significant improvement of the inflammatory symptoms of the disease.</p>
    <p>&quot;The progress of the research to date is very encouraging,&quot;, said ANRF
    President and University of California, Irvine, Professor of Immunology, Gale A. Granger,
    Ph.D. &quot;If the research continues to demonstrate similar clinical results, this
    treatment should be available through your doctor within the next few years and rheumatoid
    arthritis patients can look forward to less pain and increased mobility.&quot; </p>
    <p>During the 1970s and 1980s, the Arthritis National Research Foundation supported
    important research which led to the discovery of cytokines, the substance released by the
    body&#146;s white blood cells which causes the attack on and destruction of healthy joint
    tissues. More specifically, the two agents released by the white blood cells which cause
    this destruction of tissues are known as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxins<b>.</b></p>
    <p>Subsequent research conducted during the late 1980s and 1990s, also supported in part
    by the Foundation, revealed that certain body cells release a molecule which blocks TNF
    activity by combining with and inactivating these two cytokines. By isolating and using
    this molecule to block the TNF activity, the pain and inflammation of joints associated
    with rheumatoid arthritis may be significantly reduced. </p>
    <p>Clinical trials utilizing this <i>TNF-receptor</i>, as this treatment is known, are
    currently underway at research centers across the country. Initial results indicate that
    semi-weekly injections are reducing the clinical symptoms of up to 61% of patients with
    rheumatoid arthritis<i> </i>and hold promise as a new therapy for this debilitating
    disease.</p>
    <p>The scientific pathway that led to this important new therapy took almost 30 years to
    develop from discovery and characterization to successful clinical testing. The Arthritis
    National Research Foundation has been funding rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic
    disease research since 1952. Based in Long Beach, Calif., the Arthritis National Research
    Foundation disseminates information to the public and physicians on current research
    through a periodic newsletter. Grants are awarded on an annual basis. Proposals are
    peer-reviewed by the medical committee of the board of directors, as well as NIH-level
    expert scientists and physicians in the field. </p>
