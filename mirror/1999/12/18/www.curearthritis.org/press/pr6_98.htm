    Disease Pathways Studied</font></strong></font></p>
    </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><p>The Arthritis National Research Foundation has
    funded four scientific studies investigating the disease pathways that lead to the
    debilitating autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus (SLE) and scleroderma. The
    studies range from pinpointing the genetic make-up of cells susceptible to Rheumatoid
    Arthritis to understanding the human immune system&#146;s malfunctioning in Systemic Lupus
    Erythematosus (SLE or Lupus).</p>
    <p>&quot;Understanding the disease pathway is the first step toward determining the cause
    of the disease and, ultimately develop new therapies,&quot; said Gale A. Granger, Ph.D.,
    Arthritis National Research Foundation president and Professor of Immunology at the
    University of California, Irvine. &quot;The four investigators receiving grants from ANRF
    this year exemplify the Foundation&#146;s dedication to studying why and how the body
    reacts as it does in the pathogenesis of these autoimmune diseases,&quot; he added.</p>
    <p>A normally functioning immune system enables us to recover from infections by releasing
    antibodies to attack foreign, unwanted substances. In Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Lupus,
    which are autoimmune diseases, this highly efficient immune system has made a mistake and
    is attacking &quot;self tissues.&quot; While not the most prevalent form of rheumatic
    disease (osteoarthritis impacts over 17 million Americans), RA and Lupus are the most
    painful and crippling rheumatic diseases, affecting nearly eight million Americans.</p>
    <p>Since 1952, the Arthritis National Research Foundation has provided grant funds for
    basic scientific studies into the causes of and new therapies for rheumatic diseases. The
    investigators awarded grants for the 1998-99 grant cycle are:<ul>
      <b>
      <li>Susan Kovats, Ph.D., Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope</li>
      <li>Elizabeth Mellins, M.D., Stanford University Medical Center</li>
      <li>Rebecca Tuetken, M.D., Ph.D., University of Iowa</li>
      <li>Paul Utz, M.D., Harvard Medical School</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Susan Kovats, Ph.D.</strong>, of the Beckman Research Institute of the City of
    Hope in Duarte, California, received a $35,000 grant to study the nature of self-antigens
    (substances released by the body, as opposed to foreign substances, to stimulate
    production of antibodies) in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Her investigation will focus on whether
    tissue damage or infection confuse the recognition mechanism of the immune system, thereby
    attacking self-tissues as if they were foreign. &quot;Insights to these self-antigens will
    aid the design of strategies for therapeutic intervention in RA,&quot; said Dr. Kovats.</p>
    <p>Dr. Kovats received her Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1991, and is
    currently an Assistant Research Scientist in the Beckman Institute&#146;s Division of
    Immunology.</p>
    <p><strong>Elizabeth Mellins, M.D.</strong>, of the Stanford University Medical Center,
    received $40,000 to test the hypothesis that RA susceptible genes interact differently
    with key regulators in the RA disease pathway than do non-susceptible genes. Specifically,
    she will investigate if inherited genetic alterations in the recognition mechanism of the
    immune system are defective and cause the patient to identify certain self-antigens as
    foreign. This novel approach may yield insight into RA pathogenesis, providing fuel for
    new therapeutic strategies.</p>
    <p>Dr. Mellins is a practicing pediatric rheumatologist and an innovator in the field of
    antigen presentation. She received her M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1978 and has
    taught both Pediatrics and Rheumatology at the University of Washington, University of
    Pennsylvania and Stanford University Medical Center.</p>
    <p><strong>Rebecca Tuetken, M.D., Ph.D.</strong>, of the University of Iowa, received
    $40,000 to study the mechanism of how the immune system recognizes and reacts against
    foreign and self-DNA (genetic information). This will help explain how certain patients
    with autoimmune diseases react </p>
    <p>against their own DNA. &quot;My hope is that this study will provide both a more
    complete understanding of the innate immune response to bacterial DNA and new insights in
    the pathogenesis of SLE, possibly leading to new therapeutic approaches,&quot; said Dr.
    Tuetken.</p>
    <p>Currently a post-doctoral fellow in Rheumatology at the University of Iowa Hospitals
    and Clinics, Dr. Tuetken received her Ph.D. in Immunology and M.D. from the University of
    Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine in 1989 and 1991, respectively.</p>
    <p><strong>Paul Utz, M.D.</strong>, of Brigham and Women&#146;s Hospital, which is
    affiliated with Harvard Medical School in Boston, received $40,000 to study cell
    death&#146;s role in the development of autoimmune diseases such as lupus and scleroderma.
    Dr. Utz&#146;s study will focus on the mechanism of how proteins released from dying
    self-cells can be modified and how these modified proteins then stimulate the
    patient&#146;s immune system. Once stimulated, the immune system will attack both dying
    and living cells to cause autoimmune disease. Successful completion of this project may
    greatly advance the level of understanding of autoimmune disease mechanism.</p>
    <p>Dr. Utz is a practicing rheumatologist and instructor at Brigham and Women&#146;s
    Hospital and Harvard Medical School, who received his M.D. in 1991 from Stanford
    University School of Medicine.</p>
    <p>The Arthritis National Research Foundation has been funding arthritis and rheumatic
    disease research since 1952. Based in Long Beach, California, ANRF disseminates
    information to the public on current research through a periodic newsletter and their web
    site, <a href="../index.htm"><b>www.curearthritis.org</b></a>. Grants are awarded on an
    annual basis. Proposals are peer-reviewed by the Medical Committee of the Board of
    Directors, as well as NIH-level expert scientists and physicians in the field. </p>
