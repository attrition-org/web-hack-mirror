<p><font color="#400080">Enbrel: The Long-Awaited TNF Inhibitor is Available</font></b></i></font><br>
<font FACE="Arial">The FDA recently licensed a genetically engineered protein that helps
reduce symptoms of moderate to severe, active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). RA affects over
two million Americans and is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks self-tissues.
The new treatment, called <b>Enbrel</b>, binds to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a
naturally occurring protein in the body, and inhibits its action. TNF, which is believed
to promote inflammation in the body, is found at elevated levels in the fluid surrounding
the affected joints of RA patients. <b>Enbrel</b> injections are currently available
through your physician. </p>
<b>

<p>Enbrel</b> is an entirely new approach to the management of RA. It is the first in a
new class of drugs known as <i>biologic response modifiers</i>, which specifically
interrupt the inflammatory process. In clinical studies, patients taking <b>Enbrel</b> had
significantly reduced pain and the number of swollen and tender joints. The drug is
intended for those RA patients with moderate to severe RA who have not been able to
achieve relief with one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as
methotrexate. It may also be used in combination with methotrexate. <i>Known side effects
are</i>: Mild to moderate injection site reactions. The long-term effects, on the
development or course of serious infection, malignancy and autoimmune disease are unknown.
Patients with a serious infection, or who are allergic to <b>Enbrel</b> or any of its
components should not take this medicine.</p>

<p>For more information, please consult your physician, call the Immunex Corporation at
1-888-4ENBREL, or visit the company-sponsored web site, <strong><a

<p><font color="#400080">Arava approved for RA Treatment</font></b></font><br>
<font FACE="Arial">In September, the FDA approved <b>Arava</b> (leflunomide) as a new
treatment for adult RA. This drug, which is taken in tablet form, inhibits at least one
enzyme in lymphocytes (cells of the immune system) and thereby interferes with the RA
disease process. In clinical trials, patients taking <b>Arava</b> showed significant
improvement in pain and swelling of joints and joint damage seemed to be retarded. <i>Known
side effects are</i>: Not recommended for patients with significant liver disease,
children, pregnant or nursing women. Patients may experience diarrhea or, rarely, liver
problems, hair loss, skin rash or hypertension.</p>

<p><font color="#400080">Cox-2 Inhibitors: Pain Relief without Stomach Upset?</font></i></font><br>
<font FACE="Arial">Therapy expected to benefit those with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid
arthritis<br>
</b>As many as 107,000 hospitalizations and 16,500 deaths occur each year in the United
States as a result of the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as
ibuprofren, naproxen and aspirin. These drugs help pain management of arthritis, but
patients may develop moderate to severe gastrointestinal problems. One solution may be a
new class of drugs which has been being developed by G.D. Searle &amp; Co., and also by
Merck &amp; Co. These drugs are known as COX-2 inhibitors and are aimed at reducing the
adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system. The test results are promising: the drugs
seem to target the COX-2 enzyme, produced primarily at the site of inflammation, while <em>not
</em>inhibiting the COX-1 enzyme, which is needed for proper digestive function. It is the
inhibition of COX-1, which is believed to be the cause of serious gastro-intestinal side
effects, such as ulcers, which have been associated with the use of NSAIDs.<b></p>
</b>

<p>Searle&#146;s <b>Celebrex</b> received FDA approval in early January, 1999. The drug is
still in the testing phase at this time. You can visit Searle at their web site to obtain
current information: <strong><a HREF="http://www.searlehealthnet.com/">www.searlehealthnet.com</a></strong>.
<b>Vioxx</b> is the COX-2 inhibitor drug which Merck &amp; Co. is currently testing and is
on the fast track for approval by the FDA.</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p><font color="#400080">Lyme Disease Vaccine receives FDA Approval</font></b></font><br>
<font FACE="Arial">LYMErix, a vaccine for the prevention of Lyme disease, received
approval for use from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December. Lyme disease, an
illness borne by ticks, is a potentially serious multi-stage bacterial infection, with
symptoms ranging from a skin rash and flu-like symptoms to arthritis and heart
abnormalities.</p>

<p>The vaccine is manufactured by SmithKline Beecham and should be considered by people
who live in or travel to tick-infested areas.</p>

<p><font color="#400080">Non-Drug Treatment Alternative: Prosorba Column</font></i></font></b><font
FACE="Arial"></p>

<p>The FDA Gastroenterology and Urology Device Advisory Panel recommended approval for the
treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis of <b>Prosorba Column</b>. This
treatment has been used to treat Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), an immune
blood disorder, since 1987. Prosorba Column will now be used to treat RA, as well.</p>
<b>

<p>Prosorba Column</b> is a plastic cylinder that contains highly purified protein A
immobilized on an inert silica matrix. The protein A Binds to and removes antibodies,
including antigens that contribute to the symptoms of RA. The standard course of treatment
involves 12 weekly outpatient sessions. Each session takes approximately two hours. In a
process similar to kidney dialysis, blood is removed from the patient&#146;s arm and
passed through a machine that separates the blood cells from the plasma. The plasma is
then passed through the <b>Prosorba Column</b>, recombined with the blood cells and
finally returned to the patient through the other arm.</p>

<p>In clinical trials across the country, patients who had failed with DMARDs (such as
methotrexate) underwent 12 <b>Prosorba Column</b> treatments. Nearly half showed
significant clinical improvement as measured by stringent American College of Rheumatology
criteria. Patients showed significant reduction in swollen and tender joint counts and the
response was durable, some lasting as long as 75 weeks.</font></p>
