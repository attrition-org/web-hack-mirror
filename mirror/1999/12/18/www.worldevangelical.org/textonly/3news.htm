<A NAME="gcgr"></a><H3>NEW NAME AND LEADERSHIP CHOSEN FOR GLOBAL EVANGELIZATION NETWORK</H3>
<I>8 November 1999, Press Release</I><BR>
<P>
Leaders primarily affiliated with three international evangelical movements
have combined forces to create a global evangelization network. This new
international network, called the <B>Great Commission Global Roundtable
(GCGR)</B>, welcomes membership from other networks and ministries committed to
extending Christ's message to the world in the 21st century.<BR>
<P>
The Roundtable resulted after joint meetings of the <B>World Evangelical
Fellowship</B>, the <B>Lausanne Movement for World Evangelization</B>, and the <B>AD2000
and Beyond Movement</B> in <A HREF="3newsold.htm#global">August in Dallas</a> and <A HREF="3newsold.htm#intl-coop">earlier in Norway</a>.  A
facilitation team chosen at the Dallas meeting picked the name, Great
Commission Global Roundtable, to emphasize obedience to Christ's mandate to
evangelize all peoples while listening to God and one another "around the
table" of the Lord.<BR>
<P>
The Roundtable's purpose is to hear, serve and connect diverse segments of
the Body of Christ in hopes of achieving closer coordination and
cooperation in sharing the Gospel.<BR>
<P>
The Roundtable's coordinators for the next two years are Bertil Ekstrom
(Brazil), chair; Iman Santoso (Indonesia), vice-chair; and John Robb (USA),
international coordinator.<BR>
<P>
The coordinators and international task force members welcome suggestions
and help in contacting networks and ministries that should be part of the
Roundtable.<BR>

<A NAME="uk-assembly"></a><H3>UK EVANGELICALS TO HOLD ASSEMBLY IN 2001</H3>
A general Assembly of Evangelicals will be held in Cardiff in
November 5th - 7th, 2001 at the Cardiff International Arena.<BR>
<P>
The Assembly has been called by the Evangelical Alliance UK,
which represents over one million Christians in 30 denominations
throughout the UK.<BR>
<P>
The Alliance are expecting 4,000 Christians at the event which is
open to all delegations from churches and all involved in church
leadership.<BR>
<P>
Rev Joel Edwards, general director of the Alliance said: "This
Assembly will help us to refocus the agenda for the Evangelical
Alliance in the third millennium as we seek to challenge the people
and governments of our nations to recognise the bad choices we
have made as a society and offer leadership in new directions
which are morally and spiritually sound."<BR>
<P>







<HR>
<A NAME="expo"></a><H3>WORLD EXPO IN GERMANY</H3>
The next World EXPO is scheduled for the year 2000 to be held June 1 to October
31 in Hannover, Germany.  The theme is "Mankind-Nature-Technology".  People are
looking for answers to urgent global questions concerning how to live and survive after AD2000.  
The entire spectrum of ideas and world views and the apparent answers of old and new religions
 will be present.  What ideas, what solutions and answers will Christians present?<BR>
<P>

At EXPO 2000 the German Evangelical Alliance will communicate the central
message of the Gospel from a biblical story --God saves, He is the
reason for hope, participate and get involved.  Their theme is "You are not
alone".   Programs will be presented for children and families.  A family camp and an international youth
camp with Christian program will be presented.<BR>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.poh.de">PAVILION OF HOPE</a> provides a one-time opportunity to present the
hope of Christianity to young people attending the World Expo in
Hannover, Germany.  People are needed to present interactive gospel
presentations, assist people in the pavilion and staff the family camp. 
The Pavilion of Hope, a large glass and aluminum fish-shaped building,
is the official youth pavilion at EXPO 2000.  It is
sponsored by the German Evangelical Alliance, Campus Crusade and
the YMCA.<BR>
<P>
International help is being requested for planning, for staffing, for housing
10,000 each night, and finances.<BR>
<P>

<A NAME="stats"></A><H3>GLOBAL STATISTICS</H3>
According to Patrick Johnstone, director of research at WEC International...<BR>
<OL>
<li>In the past 25 years, the total number of Christians had grown by 60% from
1.25 billion to 1.95 billion.  Percentage of world population remained stagnant
at approximately 34%, while the percentage of Muslims increased from 15.9% to
19.6%.
<li>Number of Muslims more than doubled since 1970 from 564 million to 1.3
billion--main reason is high birth rate.
<li>Today 58% of Protestants worldwide live in Africa and Asia (almost 600
million)
<li>Evangelicals had an annual growth rate of 5%. From 125 million in 1970 to
over 300 million.
<li>In 1960 there were only 25 baptized Christians in the Hindu Kingdom of Nepal,
on the 'roof of the world'. Today there are 200,000 Christians out of a population of 20 million that is 89% Hindu, 7% Buddhist, and 3.5% Muslim. During government persecution
in the 1980's, 2-3 Christians from every church were imprisoned. The Nepalese Christians are striving to reach the goal of one million Christians by the turn of the century.
<li>Tibet is closed to the gospel- occupied by Chinese forces.  Only 200
Christians among a population of 5 million Tibetans.
<li>In 1990 there were only five known evangelical believers in the communist atheist country of Albania. Today there are 129 churches with 6,000 believers.
