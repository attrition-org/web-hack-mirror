    <td width="75%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ARMENIA, Colombia -- On January 25, 1999, an earthquake
    measuring 6.0 on the Richter Scale destroyed the Colombian cities of Armenia, Claraca, and
    Pereira. Preliminary figures indicate that over 900 people have died and more than 3,500
    are injured. Hundreds of thousands of people are still homeless. These figures continue to
    rise daily with the discovery of more victims from within the rubble.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government of Colombia has requested assistance from the
    international community including relief organizations such as MAP International .The
    extreme need for emergency medical assistance is critical. The provision of appropriate
    medicines and supplies is essential for saving the lives of many and stabilizing the
    health of thousands of injured Colombians.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAP International relief workers immediately began preparing tons of
    essential medicines and medical supplies for flights into the areas of most destruction.
    In partnership with Colombian NGOs and a number of other U.S. Christian relief agencies,
    MAP is providing nearly $750,000 worth of valuable medicines and supplies for ongoing
    medical relief efforts.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only through the continued support of friends like you can we respond
    to emergencies in Colombia and throughout the world.</td>

    </small></strong>ANCHAYACU, Ecuador -- In an ambitious and groundbreaking project, MAP
    International is planting a chain of pharmacies deep in the remote Ecuadorian coastal
    jungle. As port of the Emeraldas Province Project, the &quot;satellite
    mini-pharmacies&quot; will be supplied with medicines by a mobile health unit traveling up
    the Onzole and Cayapas Rivers. The pharmacies will serve approximately 5,000 people in 15
    Indian communities.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jungle pharmacy network has evangelistic, as well as humanitarian
    goals. Missionaries in the province hope to use MAP's medical outreach to open doors for
    the message of spiritual healing found only in Jesus Christ.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Anchayacu Indians suffer from a multitude of health problems,
    including diarrhea (caused by improper sanitation and contaminated drinking water),
    malaria, parasites, snakebites, skin disease, upper respiratory infections, and anemia.
    Finding emergency medical help requires a two-hour river trip by motorboat and <em>eight
    hours</em> by paddle canoe -- often too far away to save a life by traditional means.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAP has committed to provide the financial support to keep the
    pharmacies stocked with lifesaving medicines, as well as to provide administrative
    oversight to measure the progress of this health outreach.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Please pray for adequate funding and spiritual impact for this
    project.</em><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the generosity of friends like you, God is working along these
    remote rivers to pour out a flood of physical health and spiritual life</font></td>
