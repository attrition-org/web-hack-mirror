            this life-saving donation.</b></p>
            <p align="left">After three decades of brutal civil
            war, Guatemala is one of the poorest nations in the
            world. Seventy-five percent of its rural population
            lives in poverty. Even in the cities, where economic
            conditions are better, poverty affects two-thirds of
            the people.</p>
            <p align="left">In 1996, a peace accord signed
            between the government and guerrillas brought new
            hope that the shattered country can be restored. But
            Guatemala faces serious health problems including
            malnutrition, a lack of clean water in many areas,
            and disease. Medical resources are concentrated in
            urban areas, although a national system is structured
            to provide health posts to outlying areas. Care is
            generally free or costs only a small fee, but
            medicines must be purchased and many clinics are not
            properly supplied. </p>
            <p align="left">Now, thanks to the gifts of friends
            like you, MAP has worked through the Office of the
            First Lady of Guatemala to ship over a million doses
            of oral polio vaccine which will be distributed to
            clinics throughout the country.</p>
            <p align="left">John Garvin, MAP&#146;s Director of
            Agency Services went to Guatemala in June and met
            with the Minister of Health to assure proper delivery
            and storage of the vaccines. </p>
            <p align="left">With the much needed polio vaccines,
            Guatemala launched a national campaign to immunize
            children against this crippling and deadly disease.
            Beginning July 3, babies under a year old were
            immunized and five-year-old children were receiving
            free booster vaccines. More than a million youngsters
            will benefit from this life-saving donation.</p>
            <p align="left">In addition to the shipment to
            Guatemala, MAP also sent 500,000 doses of the polio
            vaccine to the Romanian Ministry of Health and the
            World Vision Romanian Program Office. Another 150,000
            doses were distributed in partnership with World
            Vision to the Ministry of Health in Bulgaria.</p>
            <p align="left">We praise God for this wonderful
            donation of vaccines. Valued at over $30 million, it
            is already being used to protect innocent children
            from the dreaded disease of polio. Thank you for your
            partnership in helping MAP cover the costs of
            shipping and distributing the vaccine to some of the
            neediest nations in the world.</p>
            <p align="left">While many of us remember the scourge
            of polio in the United States which affected tens of
            thousands of children and adults, the immunizations
            now in effect have virtually eliminated the danger
            for our children.</p>
            <p align="left">But worldwide polio outbreaks still
            claim countless lives each year. Without widespread
            immunization, children in impoverished nations like
            Romania, Guatemala, and Bulgaria are especially
            vulnerable. Thanks to the gifts of caring friends
            like you, MAP&#146;s shipment of valuable polio
            vaccines to these nations will protect more than half
            a million infants and children!</p>

            color="#800000" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>In
            Cuba, Evangelistic Team Shares Gospel, Life-saving
            Medicines with Suffering People</b></font></p>
            <p align="left">&quot;The trip to Cuba was terribly
            revealing. Conditions in mainland Cuba are worse than
            we had seen anywhere in Russia, Romania, or even
            Albania,&quot; reports Timothy Dahlin, Executive
            Director of the John Guest Evangelistic Team. </p>
            <p align="left">&quot;The majority of Havana is
            dismally disintegrating with once-beautiful villas
            and mansions now looking like slum dwellings. Most
            village homes lack plumbing, windows, or adequate
            lighting; they are mere shanty-like shacks with palm
            branches for roofing and weeds for landscaping.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">During the ministry trip last August,
            the JGET Team visited six churches in Havana and five
            other Cuban cities. &quot;In spite of dire economic
            straits, Cuban Christians are optimistic and joyful
            in the Lord,&quot; says Dahlin. &quot;Thousands of
            people worship on any given day across Cuba, but only
            in small, crowded, and often dilapidated
            structures.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">In addition to preaching the Word,
            the JGET Team distributed urgently needed MAP
            medications to three hospitals and two individual
            churches.</p>
            <p align="left">Among the hospitals receiving the MAP
            medicines was the Children&#146;s Hospital in
            Matanzas. Dahlin described it as a &quot;busy, tragic
            place . . . 200 emergency cases each day, with 300
            other regular patients.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">The Team also brought vital medicines
            to an AIDS sanitarium, where the supervising
            physician was thrilled to receive them. AIDS
            facilities are low on the priority list for the
            limited pharmaceuticals available in the country.</p>
            <p align="left">Another ministry trip by the JGET
            Team is slated for January. With the help of friends
            like you, MAP will once again provide medicines and
            supplies for distribution to churches and hospitals
            within Cuba.</p>
            <p align="left">Pray for this troubled land and its
            people. As Dahlin says, &quot;After almost four
            decades of communism, they not only need Jesus
            Christ, but also need just about every form of
            medical product they can possibly receive.&quot;</p>

            Korea: Slow starvation threatens a generation</b></font></p>
            <p align="left">In the orphanages of North Korea, the
            little ones sit listlessly, their bodies stunted,
            their eyes dimmed with the pain of hunger, their
            malnourished bodies mere skin and bones. Many are
            there, abandoned by parents who are no longer able to
            feed and care for them. The scene is one of
            desperation.</p>
            <p align="left">With barely enough food to sustain
            life, the children are dangerously vulnerable to
            diarrhea, pneumonia, and even measles. Many are
            dying.</p>
            <p align="left">After hearing reports and
            participating first-hand in key famine-response
            summit meetings involving other NGO leaders, US
            Government officials, and leaders from the DPRK
            (Democratic People&#146;s Republic of Korea), MAP
            president Paul Thompson said, &quot;this is not a
            famine in the classic sense of Ethiopia. It is a slow
            motion starvation in a country where the government
            is loathe to admit the failure of economic policies
            and resistant to letting the world know the shame of
            the starvation which is sweeping the land.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">It is estimated that
            malnutrition--from moderate to severe--is already
            affecting 60 percent of the children in the orphanage
            centers. Many of the babies under two are the most
            severely malnourished; their tiny bodies are
            succumbing daily to the ravages of hunger.</p>
            <p align="left">The health care system has virtually
            collapsed. A limited supply of medicines is available
            to save the children who are ill. </p>
            <p align="left">As Christians, we cannot look away
            from the agony of the children and their families. In
            partnership with World Vision Canada, MAP has already
            distributed oral rehydration salts, vitamins,
            antibiotics, surgical gloves, and other medical
            supplies, valued at over $48,000.</p>
            <p align="left">But as the crisis deepens, especially
            with the harsh winter in North Korea, we must be
            prepared to meet the need. Paul Thompson has been
            approached personally by representatives of the DPRK
            to help supply medicinal aid to meet the need. We are
            also partnering with World Vision to reach out with
            Christian compassion to aid the suffering people.</p>
            <p align="left">What MAP will be able to do will
            depend on the help of friends like you, and with the
            cooperation of the North Korean government in
            assuring that the aid reaches those in need. MAP is
            offering it services to the American Council for
            Voluntary International Action (InterAction) to
            supply all medicines for their Associates. Please
            pray with us that God&#146;s people will stand
            together to help bring Christ&#146;s love in a united
            effort to save the lives of these innocent children
            and their families.</p>

            Packs Save Lives among Children of Chernobyl</b></font></p>
            <p align="left"><b>by Craig Corey, M.D.</b></p>
            <p align="left">MINSK, Belarus&#151;In April, I went
            with two family practice doctors, a
            gastroenterologist, five nurses, and a dozen other
            people on a two-week medical mission to what were
            referred to as the &quot;invalids of Chernobyl.&quot;
            </p>
            <p align="left">These are the folks who actually were
            in the damaged nuclear plant and fought the fires,
            pumped water, and buried dirt and contaminated
            equipment. They took the brunt of Chernobyl, the
            highest radiation levels. So we saw what was left of
            them.</p>
            <p align="left">We carried with us 16 MAP Travel
            Packs and smaller antibiotic packs, as well as other
            equipment like stethoscopes and otoscopes.</p>
            <p align="left">We held three clinics. </p>
            <p align="left">The first was in Minsk at Hospital
            Number One. We set up our clinic and pharmacy and
            opened up shop. Everybody who came in the door was
            examined and treated. And everybody got vitamins,
            because they were unable to get fresh fruits and
            vegetables on a regular basis.</p>
            <p align="left">We also had what we called a
            &quot;caring room,&quot; where people shared the
            gospel. Only patients who wanted to went in; it
            wasn&#146;t the price of admission.</p>
            <p align="left">An interesting story came out of our
            visit to the intensive care unit. We saw a very sick
            child. One had received multiple antibiotics for
            infections and, of course, developed a massive fungal
            infection and was septic (a putrid or poisoned state
            caused by the absorption of pathogenic microorganisms
            and their products into the bloodstream). The
            hospital staff asked if we had antifungal
            medications. </p>
            <p align="left">One of the not so often requested
            drugs that had been included in the antibiotic box
            just happened to be two big bottles of an antifungal
            medicine called Ancobon (flucytosine). I didn&#146;t
            see any use for it at the time because we
            weren&#146;t going to treat any oral fungal
            infections. But God knew. And we were able to help
            the child survive.</p>
            <p align="left">One of the things that blessed me
            most was assuring them that every one of them was a
            hero and that we really did appreciate what they did
            for the world by stopping the process at Chernobyl. I
            think that really helped many of the victims just to
            realize that people outside Belarus understood what
            they did and considered them to be heroes and that we
            were honored to be caring for them.</p>
            <p align="left">In addition to the hospital clinics,
            we made house calls to people who were so hobbled by
            their diseases that they couldn&#146;t be cared for
            in a hospital. One man had cancer and had received a
            severe dose of radiation in an attempt to treat this
            cancer and had spinal cord paralysis as a result. It
            was very emotional in private settings like these.
            There were lots of tears and lots of thanks.</p>
            <p align="left">When we left Minsk, we had 10 Travel
            Packs left. The next clinic was at the orphanage in
            Osipovichi, where we administered five more Travel
            Packs. And we distributed the last five at the third
            clinic in Mogilev.</p>
            <p align="left">Even before I left Belarus, I knew I
            would be back. The prescriptions will run out, and
            we&#146;ll need to send more medicines to replace
            them. There are many people who we didn&#146;t get to
            see. And there are many more who are right now being
            affected by the ongoing nuclear leakage from
            Chernobyl.</p>

            unbelievably different from anything I had ever
            experienced, and it was clearly one of the happiest,
            most mind-expanding, and most spiritually fulfilling
            times in my life. </p>
            <p align="left">&quot;I noted the following
            &#145;bizarre&#146; diagnoses in my journal: severe
            abscesses, anthrax, kwashiorkor, malaria, typhoid
            fever, tuberculosis, vitamin A deficiency, neonatal
            tetanus, and rheumatic fever. I probably got more
            experience with these diseases that first day than I
            would have in a lifetime of practice in the States.
            Other things I saw included filariasis, amoebiasis,
            ascariasis, hookworm, severe impetigo,
            strongyloidiasis, Weil&#146;s Syndrome,
            leptospirosis, and others I probably don&#146;t
            remember.</p>
            <p align="left">&quot;That same day, Dr. Steve James
            (who has served in Haiti for about 11 years) said
            some wise things to me. Many people from the U.N. or
            America have come and tried to improve things, he
            said, but they give up in a couple of years because
            of all the roadblocks to progress there are in Haiti.
            What Dr. James said was to do what God tells you, and
            don&#146;t worry about the results. It takes years to
            see progress. The success of this hospital is not
            that Haiti is richer (it isn&#146;t) or that health
            is improving (it isn&#146;t). The gospel is going
            out, and there is no greater accomplishment on earth.</p>
            <p align="left">&quot;What I gleaned was that you
            have to totally divest yourself from the worldly view
            of things. There is hardly any worldly success to be
            found here. The real challenge is to keep your mind
            on things above. Since God has called us, He is the
            one we serve. As another person explained it to me,
            medicine is just public relations for the gospel. My
            part is to serve, trust, and obey. God has promised
            to do the rest.</p>
            <p align="left">&quot;With about 10 days left in
            Haiti, I wrote in my journal: &#145;When you have
            finally given up any illusion that you are making a
            difference and any notions that you are accomplishing
            something, you are left simply with service for the
            sake of serving and glorifying God. It really hurts
            to give this much day after day. It rends my heart to
            see endless needs and only have very limited skill to
            help. This, however, is true service. This is the
            heart of the missionary spirit. God does not call us
            just to be effective; He calls us to be
            faithful.&#146; &quot;</p>

            Latin America, MAP Radio Supports Church Involvement
            in Health</b></font></p>
            <p align="left">ECUADOR&#151;Last December, MAP Latin
            America (MAPLA) launched a one-week pilot project to
            broadcast powerful new radio programs throughout
            Latin America in over 60 HCJB radio network stations.
            And the response rapidly demonstrated the need for
            more.</p>
            <p align="left">MAPLA began this summer by producing
            21 public service announcements on a wide variety of
            health topics, including AIDS, disaster relief,
            hygiene, water management, alcoholism, and nutrition
            for Christians. </p>
            <p align="left">The next stage, as soon as funding is
            available, will be a weekly, hour-long program that,
            in addition to presenting a comprehensive message on
            each topic, will encourage personal interaction with
            MAPLA.</p>
            <p align="left">Latin America &quot;has been one of
            the great evangelical missionary successes of the 20<sup>th</sup>
            century,&quot; says Patrick Johnstone, author of <i>Operation
            World.</i> &quot;The impact of the Scriptures on
            [Latin America] has opened the hearts of millions to
            a personal encounter with the Lord Jesus,&quot; says
            Johnstone.</p>
            <p align="left">Media have accounted for a great part
            of this phenomenal growth.</p>
            <p align="left">It is because of the support of
            friends like you that MAP can reach out to the people
            of Latin America with practical teaching on critical
            health, community, and national issues and provide
            programs developed to strengthen and equip the
            church.</p>
