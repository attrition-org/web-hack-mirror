    Montenegro this spring, MAP responded to requests from relief workers in the field who
    desperately needed medicine and first aid supplies. Through June, MAP had prepared <u>over
    $6 million (wholesale value) worth of medicines</u>, <u>medical supplies and nutritional
    supplements equaling ten 20-foot shipping containers</u> for the refugee effort. These
    shipments were shared with International Medical Corps, World Vision Canada, World Vision
    US and World Relief among others.<u><p>Multi-drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB) is
    reaching epidemic proportions in several areas</u> around the globe. MAP is working with
    Partners in Health in successful pilot programs to investigate effective disease
    management in both <u>Haiti and Peru</u>. These pilot programs have been cited by the WHO
    and International Red Cross as model programs. MAP is a prime supplier of medicines and
    supplies to the clinics participating in the program and has committed to provide
    logistical and assessment support.</td>

    MAP-facilitated <u>AIDS workshop for Church</u> <u>leadership</u>. In June, <u>the
    Anglican Church of Kenya (ACK)</u> assembled delegates to attend this workshop as the
    first step in the development of a formal policy for the church country-wide on HIV/AIDS
    and other major health concerns.<p>MAP and CORAT/Africa conducted a <u>Drugs Baseline
    Study </u>in sixteen health units in five Kenyan provinces. This study is <u>the initial
    step in a program to increase the availability of high quality and affordable essential
    drugs through a sustainable, cost recovery program</u>. Funded by the Swedish Pentecostal
    International Relief &amp; Development Agency (PMU Interlife), the study uncovered that
    90% of the health units surveyed have been unable to maintain a continuous supply of
    essential medicines. <u>One-half of the health units visited did not have medicines at the
    time of the visit</u>. Several of the units have management problems and while some units
    had previously trained community health workers and traditional birth attendants, there
    was little if any interaction with them to reach the community with health information.</td>

    This workshop was held in collaboration with the Pharmaceutical Program of the World
    Council of Churches. The World Health Organization in Geneva sent a representative.
    Physicians, pharmacists, and hospital managers representing Catholic, Mainline and
    Evangelical churches agreed to form an <font FACE="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&quot;Association
    Francophone des Oeuvres Sanitaires Chretiennes&quot; (Association of French-Speaking

    guinea worm disease in Cote d&#146;Ivoire</u> are experiencing promising results. A recent
    mid-year evaluation of the program shows the <u>incidence of the disease has dropped from
    900 cases last year to 209 this year (a decrease of 77%)</u>. If this trend continues, the
    target of eradicating the disease nationwide by 2003 will be realized. </font></td>
