    Church of the Nazarene Compassionate Ministries to deliver and distribute an Emergency
    Health kit (EHK). <u>Each Emergency Health Kit contains medicines and first aid supplies
    to treat 10,000 people for three months</u>. The EHK was airlifted to the hospital that

    material for a Latin America audience</u> this quarter. AIDS, WOMEN, and the CHURCH
    consists of pamphlets, workbooks, group participation guides, and an audio-cassette for
    both individual and group reflection. A YOUTH and AIDS video has also been produced after
    extensive testing and editing with the help of youth from age 14-18 in six countries.
    &quot;Que pasa si te doy un beso?&quot; (&quot;<em>What happens if I give You a
    Kiss?&quot;</em>) has already been adopted by the Ecuador Ministry of Health as an
    education piece for use in secondary schools. Other countries' education ministries are
    currently analyzing the materials and also have expressed interest in adopting them for
    use in their schools.<p>A group of MAP-trained <u>women health promoters from the capital
    city of Quito traveled to river communities in the Amazon rain forest</u> for a week
    giving health talks, learning about local health problems and treatments, and sharing
    cultural differences and customs.</p>
    <p>In Bolivia, <u>120 children in the community of Chilimarca have been organized into
    groups for skill-building in personal health, hygiene and disease prevention</u>. MAP
    calls this project &quot;Child to Child&quot; because the sessions are run by 24 youth
    volunteers from the community. The youth facilitators are trained in workshops and they,
    in turn, hold weekly meetings with the children.</td>

    on August 7th that killed 247 and wounded nearly 5,000, <u>MAP's east and Southern Africa
    office delivered a consignment of medicines, gauze, sutures and surgical materials to
    Kenyatta Hospital.</u> This donation was made possible by the release of a special
    disaster module by Johnson and Johnson Family of Companies, and processing and freight
    charges were assumed in partnership by MAP and the Southern Baptist mission board. Kenya's
    minister of health, Jackson Kalweo, accepted the donation on behalf of his country and

    <td width="630">An agreement was signed in July with the ministry of health of Côte
    d'Ivoire outlining MAP's role in the nationwide guinea worm eradication program. <u>As a
    result of the agreement, MAP has supplied the medicines needed n the treatment of this
    disease for the entire country for six months.</u> MAP will also assist in community
    education efforts to give affected communities the information and resources to break the
    cycle of this dreaded disease.<p>An assessment trip was made by MAP's regional director
    for West Africa to <u>Liberia to investigate the postwar condition of Christian health
    ministries and explore opportunities for MAP medical supply distribution and training.</u>
    MAP re-established long held, pre-war ties with ELWA Hospital, Phebe Hospital and the
    Christian Health Association of Liberia (CHAL). Possible future avenues of assistance for
    MAP include providing donated medicines, sharing MAP HIV/AIDS education materials
    developed for a francophone audience, and assisting in strengthening management
    capability.</td>
