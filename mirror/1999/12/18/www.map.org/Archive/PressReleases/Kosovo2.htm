<p ALIGN="CENTER">THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES FROM KOSOVO</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Brunswick, GA, -- The final count of displaced persons could reach into
the hundreds of thousands in the largest mass exodus of people in Europe since the Bosnian
war earlier in this decade. The majority of the new arrivals are women and children and
the aged. Many report being forcably ejected from their homes, experiencing the horror of
all they own being burned to the ground.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;There are rivers of refugees pouring out of Kosovo. There is
absolutely no access into Kosovo from any means and Pristina is completely closed off, no
electricity and (they are) running out of food,&quot; said Perter Kuzmic, MAP's (Medical
Assistance Programs)contact who recently returned to Croatia from Macedonia. &quot;Only
women, children and the elderly are able to travel. The men are in hiding, fearful for
their lives to travel and hoping that they are not found by the Serb army or militia
groups.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Because of this tremendous need, MAP is preparing two initial shipments of
critical medicines: topical and oral antibiotics, analgesics, nutritional supplements and
basic hygiene items. One shipment of approximately $680,000 is slated for airlift to World
Vision, Canada's offices in Podgorica, Montenegro. The second shipment valued at
approximately $1.1 million, is scheduled to be sent to Mercy Corp, in Skopje, Macedonia.
This shipment is due for delivery the second week in April. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;We are calling upon the generosity of the American people once
again,&quot; said Suzanne Baroody, MAP spokesperson. &quot;Due to the demands of Hurricane
Mitch, our financial resources are severely depleted. Please help now.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">MAP International is a non-profit relief and development agency located in
Brunswick, GA., with regional offices in Latin America and Africa. Every $1.00 donated
provides at least $15.00 in medicines and medical supplies. Only 1.4% of total revenue is
used for administration and fundraising. Contact MAP at 800-225-8550, or write MAP
International, 2200 Glynco Parkway, Brunswick, GA 31525. </p>
