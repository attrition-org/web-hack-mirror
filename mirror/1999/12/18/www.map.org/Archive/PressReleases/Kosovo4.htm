<p>Kosovo Still in Need of Assistance</p>

<p>MAP (Medical Assistance Programs) International is encouraged by the recent peace
agreements which allow for the end to the NATO bombings and the withdrawal of Serbian
troops from the Province of Kosovo. However, despite the recent arrival of Peacekeeping
forces, we anticipate a considerable period of time will pass before life can resume at
normal levels of civilian activity and social interaction. With nearly 750,000 refugees
still living outside of the borders of Kosovo it will be many months before material
assistance to those populations can cease. </p>

<p>Working through International Medical Corp (IMC), a UN/UNHCR sanctioned agency, MAP has
to date provided over $5 million in desperately needed, life-saving medicines and medical
supplies for refugees in Albania, Macedonia, and Montenegro. Due to the anticipated
lengthy period of adjustment, MAP International will continue to minister aid to agencies
actively supporting refugee populations in the countries of Albania and Macedonia. MAP
also foresees the need to provide additional support for those refugees that decide to
return to their homeland of Kosovo, which has been devastated by the conflicting forces.</p>

<p>After substantiating that all medicines and medical supplies will be delivered to the
ill, needy and infants without obstruction or confiscation by any outside parties,<font
SIZE="2"> </font>material assistance that is requested for the Province of Kosovo will be
safely transported, received and distributed by a recognized MAP partner (non-governmental
or approved UN agency). As opportunity arises for a safe and secure humanitarian aid
program to civilians beyond the Province of Kosovo, MAP will work closely with our donors
to position only designated gifts into that area of need. </p>

<p>MAP International is a 45 year old Christian, non sectarian relief and development
agency with regional offices in Latin America and Africa, and health care programs in over
130 developing countries. MAP promotes the <u>total health</u> of people living in the
world&#146;s poorest communities by partnering in the: <i><b>provision of essential
medicines</b></i>,<b> </b>the <i><b>prevention and eradication of disease, and the
promotion of community health development</b></i>. Every $1 donated provides $21 in
medicines, medical supplies and programs. Administrative and fundraising expenses total
only 1.4% of total revenue.</p>

International at 1-800-225-8550, or write: MAP International, P.O. Box 215000, Brunswick,
