            MAP West Africa encourages and supports key Christian leaders who are demonstrating
            commitment to Total Health in their ministries and are challenging the churches to assume
            their biblical responsibility to transform their communities. <br>

            Situation</strong></font></a></p>
            <p><font color="#000000">Tribalism. Poverty. AIDS. Inaction. These are the issues that
            most directly affect the total health needs of people in West Africa. This is a diverse
            region of 209 million people living in 22 nations, where health care is often beyond
            reach.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000000">The biggest threat in the region is tribalism, which often leads
            to violence, a primary health concern. The respected journal &quot;Jeune Afrique&quot;
            called tribalism the &quot;father of all evils,&quot; which has re-emerged throughout the
            region to prevent nations from taking care of their own citizens. Tribalism even infects
            the church in West Africa, a result of the way tribes were evangelized. Denomination that
            sent missionaries to West Africa focused on particular tribes. Even today the close ties
            between tribes and denominations remain, resulting in a splintered and fractured church.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000000">A second issue affecting the health of the region's people is
            poverty. West Africa's economies have yet to recover from the devaluation in 1994 of the
            C.F.A. currency shared by all of the French-speaking nations in the region. Health care
            remains out of reach for many who cannot afford it, and the hospitals and clinics that
            provide care face financial threats as well.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000000">In the midst of AIDS and other diseases, services offered by
            Christian health institutions are few and far between. Churches in the French-speaking
            countries of West Africa are rarely involved in social issues, including health. This,
            too, has historical roots. The French who colonized much of West Africa separated the
            society and the church, which was assigned only a spiritual role. As a result, few
            Christian health institutions have been developed. And those that were developed survive
            with little support.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000000">It is within this context that MAP International is working to be
            a light of health and hope. MAP is working to assess, and then meet, the needs of
            Christian health institutions and hospitals and to encourage the church to take an active
            role in health issues. In addition, MAP is providing training and educational materials to
            empower those who take up the work of holistic health. </font></p>

            and Hope</strong></font></a></p>
            <p><font color="#000000">Dr. Olivia Akakpo walked from the classroom after the evening
            session. Her eyes sparkled with joy as she said: &quot;I am so glad I have come here to
            this workshop. Now I know that I am not the only one struggling with these difficult
            problems.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000000">Dr. Akakpo is a pediatrician at the main university hospital in
            Lome, the capital of Togo in West Africa. She attended, with 27 others from throughout the
            region, a MAP-sponsored workshop on healing the whole person.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000000">Many of the sick children Dr. Akakpo cares for have AIDS. She
            spends time with their parents trying to help them deal with the frightful reality of the
            disease, which is not only fatal but in Togolese society is very shameful. At the
            workshop, Dr. Akakpo learned an approach toward healing that encouraged health
            professionals, pastors and counselors to work together to help the sick and their families
            to find full healing of body, mind and spirit.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000000">Through the workshop, MAP helped to plant a seed of life, hope
            and healing in the Togo medical community as well as in five other African countries.</font></p>
            <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
            <hr>
            <p align="left"><a name="Program Descriptions"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#0000FF"><strong>Program
            Descriptions</strong></font></a></p>
            <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Health Training<br>
            </strong>Providing medical/pastoral health training that promotes the idea of healing the
            whole person. Workshops are designed to bring together health professionals with pastors
            and counselors to help them work as a team to address the physical, social, emotional and
            spiritual needs of hurting people. A pastor who attended a whole person healing workshop
            said that now, along with praying for physical healing, he felt comfortable working
            directly with a physician. Likewise, a physician said he was now ready to share
            responsibilities to promote total healing with a pastor. A strong component of the
            training focuses on dealing with people afflicted by HIV/AIDS.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Networking<br>
            </strong>Linking, assisting, encouraging and equipping Christian health leaders from
            throughout West Africa to promote sharing of information, best-practices models and
            encouragement. In doing so, MAP is building awareness of the need for the church
            throughout West Africa to enter into biblically holistic ministries. For instance, a
            community health center in Benin develops innovative ways to use recycling, composting and
            agriculture to promote good nutrition and environmental stewardship -- and to raise funds
            along the way to support health services. It's a model that other Christian hospitals,
            clinics and centers struggling with their own finances might be able to follow. Through
            the development of Christian Health Associations in a number of West African countries,
            MAP is helping to facilitate the sharing of such information.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Support for Christian Health Institutions<br>
            </strong>Assessing the needs of Christian health institutions in West Africa and defining
            how MAP and others can meet these needs. In English-speaking countries of West Africa,
            Christian health facilities are often well developed. That's not the case in
            French-speaking West Africa. The difference has to do with the colonial development of the
            nations. The result is that most Christian health institutions in French-speaking West
            Africa face financial, resource, and personnel crises. MAP's assessments have already led
            to the provision of medical supplies and health training workshops.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Communication<br>
            </strong>Supporting the other program areas with information. Much of the work of
            training, networking and needs assessment require an ability to print, publish and
            disseminate the latest information. Plans for the communication program include possible
            publications on health, leadership and information sharing. In addition, a resource center
            composed of materials on whole person healing and other topics is planned.</font></p>

            <p><font color="#000000">&quot;Disease, please, don't infect me. I don't have money to
            purchase medicines. Please don't infect me.&quot; These words are the lyrics to a song
            from one of West Africa's most popular singers. They reveal the despair of most West
            African people. While much of the world is preparing to enter the Third Millennium, in
            most parts of West Africa, people are struggling with basic needs. In the new global
            economy, little hope is left to them. In this context, MAP West Africa works to support
            health institutions and professionals who care for these people, raise the Church's
            awareness so it will address these challenging issues holistically, and equip and link
            Christian leaders who are willing to face these challenges. May God's people all over the
            world allow room in their heart to attend to the needs of West African people. In doing
            so, they will have done this to the least of the Lord's brothers.</font></p>
