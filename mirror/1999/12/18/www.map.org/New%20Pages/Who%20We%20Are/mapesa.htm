    MAP East and Southern Africa enables key African Christian leaders and their institutions

    <p>Three views are discernible as one looks at sub-Saharan Africa. The pessimistic view is
    that the region is poor, forgotten, underdeveloped and divided. The optimistic view is
    that the region is rich in natural resources, has great potential, is liberated and
    changing for the better. In reality, the people of sub-Saharan Africa, like all people,
    are human beings influenced by those who are busy working for development and healing and
    those who, consciously or unconsciously, are working for their downfall.</p>
    <p align="left">Certainly, the statistics tell a bleak story. The Human Development Index
    ranks Kenya 128th of 174 countries. Yet Kenya is seen as perhaps the most stable, least
    violent nation in the region. Violence is one major factor in the region's troubles, with
    ethnic and tribal conflicts making human development difficult for many. Disease is
    another. The AIDS epidemic alone has caused a decline in the area of human development.
    Tanzania has lost the equivalent of eight years of human development to AIDS. At the same
    time, health care services in the region lag behind in the face of economic systems that
    cannot sustain quality care. The number of destitute children on the street is growing.
    The cycle of poverty, malnutrition and disease affects thousands of new victims each week.</p>
    <p align="left">The reality of these situations confronts MAP's staff in East and Southern
    Africa every day. MAP has recognized that African nations need integrated programs for
    leadership, development and health care, all of which fall within the mandate of the
    church.</p>
    <p>MAP East and Southern Africa supports the church as it responds to this mandate for
    healing in strategic interventions which meet the following criteria: addresses the needs
    of the whole person; empowers people at local community level; and adheres to underlying
    policies that correspond to biblical principals. </p>

    <p align="left">The joy, anxiety, hope, despair and pain of coming home is experienced by
    many refugees returning to Rwanda. Jean Marie is one of them. He says he feels like a
    stranger in his own country. His home has been occupied by another returnee. His wife and
    children are still away in a neighboring country. Like many others, he needs encouragement
    and support.</p>
    <p>There is great need for healing and reconciliation for the Rwandan people. MAP
    International's East and Southern Africa office recognizes this great need. MAP is working
    with church leaders in Rwanda -- and also in Burundi, Zaire, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya --
    to meet the total health needs of communities in the region. Workshops on trauma
    counseling, healing and rehabilitation are being conducted in Kigali to address the needs
    in the community. MAP has also distributed medical supplies to mission hospitals in the
    country.</p>

    <p><strong>AIDS Intervention Through the Church</strong><br>
    Up to 70 percent of the 22.2 million people infected with the virus that causes AIDS live
    in sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 350,000 children born with AIDS in one year, 86 percent were
    in sub-Saharan Africa. And 5.1 million of the 6 million people who have died of AIDS have
    been from the region. The fundamental solution to the problem of AIDS is promoting healthy
    behaviors. Our AIDS initiative aims at curbing the spread of the AIDS virus in Africa
    through increased participation of African churches in effective, culturally appropriate
    and locally sustainable AIDS control programs in their communities. MAP East and Southern
    Africa intends to equip local church communities in selected countries in Africa to
    respond to the AIDS crisis with effective AIDS care and prevention programs.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Total Health Ministries<br>
    </strong>As the countries of East and Southern Africa gained independence, mission
    hospitals and Christian health programs came under the direction of emerging national
    churches. But since that time, there has been little integration of health institutions
    into overall ministry of the sponsoring church. To minister to the whole person, churches
    and their related health programs must integrate the practice of medicine with biblical
    and traditional Africa perspectives of health as wholeness. Our vision for total health
    ministries is expressed through our commitment to encouraging African church leaders to
    integrate a biblically holistic approach to human needs into the curricula of key medical
    and theological training institutions. Keys to this program are physician training
    programs and development of materials to promote the concept of total health.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Trauma Healing and Reconciliation<br>
    </strong>Africa continues to be plagued with numerous acts of violence in the form of
    inter-tribal rivalries, military coups, political instability. Tribalism remains the most
    powerful cohesive force. The ethnic clashes that have destabilized the Great Lakes Region
    in the past five years caught the attention of the international media when they erupted
    in Rwanda in April 1994. The shock waves and aftershocks are still being felt in the
    region.</p>
    <p align="left">This unfortunate situation poses great challenge to total health concerns,
    a challenge MAP East and Southern Africa has chosen to address. MAP has become a leader in
    training for, and coordination of, church-based ministries that promote peace-building and
    reconciliation. Workshops and consultations have brought together leaders from various
    countries, ethnic groups and denominations to foster a spirit of reconciliation. MAP's
    training materials and reconciliation newsletter are being used throughout the region by
    others involved this work.</p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">Dr. Peter Okaalet</font></p>
    <p align="left">The vision of MAP International East and Southern Africa is a noble one. I
    am happy to join a team whose work has been termed as &quot;focused, friendly, flexible,
    fast and faithful to God.&quot; I see MAP-ESA as part of the process that will produce a
    continent where people listen to and learn from one another irrespective of their race,
    sex, tribe or geographical location -- a continent whose people will discover and develop
    a capacity to meet their holistic health needs.</p>
    <p align="left">MAP-ESA is committed to supporting the church as it responds to its
    mandate for health, healing and reconciliation, and sees the church as the only
    institution that can transcend national and ethnic boundaries to bring wholeness of life,
    and healing to individuals, families, communities and nations in the region.</p>
    <p>The challenge of addressing the needs in the region is still with us. I am optimistic
    that from experience gained, professional expertise and the support from MAP friends and
    partners, MAP-ESA will continue to promote and support the church in health and healing
    ministries to transform communities in the region.</p>
