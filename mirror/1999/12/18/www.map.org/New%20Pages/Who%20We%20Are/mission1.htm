          <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;PREAMBLE</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">We are Christians who actively seek God's leading as we serve others
          following the example and teachings of Jesus. We are called to promote Total Health as we
          respond to needs, build partnerships, do justice and love mercy, work for reconciliation
          and peace, act with integrity and accountability, pursue excellence, and seek to learn.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">WHO WE ARE</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">While we celebrate the variety of gifts, perspectives and
          backgrounds within the MAP International Partnership, we have agreed that the following
          statements reflect the core, most basic values that are central to our corporate identity:
          </font></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><u><font face="Arial">We are Christians</font></u></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">We believe in God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We affirm that
            Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the salvation from our sins and the giver of eternal life.
            We strive to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ as found in the Bible, for in His life
            we see the example for our own. We desire Christ to be the central focus of our individual
            and corporate lives. We acknowledge and celebrate the unity of the worldwide body of
            Christ in all of its diverse manifestations.</font></p>
            <p><u><font face="Arial">Who seek God's Leading</font></u></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Through prayer, study of God's word, and mutual reflection, we
            continually seek God's direction in all of our planning, decisions and actions. Our
            spiritual reflection, worship and discipline gives us direction, motivates our creativity
            in servanthood, inspires our pursuit of knowledge and refreshes our spirits.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><u>As we serve others following the example and teachings of Jesus</u>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">We strive for Christ-like servanthood as we reflect through our
            actions Jesus' special concern for the suffering, the afflicted, the oppressed, and those
            poor of spirit, body and mind. We are committed to reach out in solidarity to those who
            are in need as we seek to continue Christ's ministry of compassion, justice and healing.
            We are convicted by the words of Jesus, as found in the Gospels, that whatever we do for
            those most in need, we also do for Him. </font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial">OUR COMMITMENTS</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Flowing from our corporate identity, the following are the key
          Commitments that we strive to honor in carrying out our Mission and Vision.</font></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><u><font face="Arial">We Promote Total Health</font></u></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Among the many human needs, we are called to focus on a ministry of
            Total Health. We define Total Health as the capacity of individuals, families and
            communities to work together to transform the conditions that promote, in a sustainable
            way, their physical, emotional, social, economical, environmental, and spiritual well
            being. </font></p>
            <p><u><font face="Arial">We Respond to Needs</font></u></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">We commit ourselves to listen to the voices and concerns of others
            who express needs and we strive to respond in timely and appropriate ways. We commit to
            encourage and honor local initiative, promoting the use of local resources and protecting
            the dignity of the poor. We will use our resources to meet these expressed needs in a
            sustainable manner, encouraging innovation, creativity and flexibility, and valuing the
            local knowledge of those with whom we serve. We emphasize actions that address long-term
            health development needs, while recognizing a responsibility to meet the immediate health
            needs of individuals, families and communities who face health risks and life-threatening
            situations.</font></p>
            <p><u><font face="Arial">We Build Partnerships</font></u></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">We proclaim the value of collaboration, of working together to
            achieve common goals. We commit to promoting unity, equality, voice, participation,
            cooperation, resource-sharing, interdependence, growth and integration among all people
            and groups. We recognize as our primary partner those with whom we seek to serve. We are
            partners as well with our own staff, donors and supporters, churches, agencies and
            governments who share a common commitment to promoting health and healing among
            individuals, families and communities. We place great value on our staffs and their
            families, and we seek to create opportunities for personal and professional growth within
            the organization.</font></p>
            <p><u><font face="Arial">We Do Justice and Love Mercy</font></u></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">We affirm that all people are created equal in the image of God, and
            should therefore share fairly in both stewarding and enjoying the gifts God has provided
            us in the Creation. We strive to do justice and love mercy, and we seek to comfort, lift
            up and defend those who are downtrodden in order to build a healthier world for all.</font></p>
            <p><u><font face="Arial">We work for Reconciliation and Peace</font></u></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">We strive to be peacemakers, actively exercising the ministry of
            reconciliation we have been given as Christians, encouraging genuine repentance and
            forgiveness and working to support processes that enable the peaceful resolution of
            conflict. We will work for genuine reconciliation between genders, races, people groups
            and with the whole creation in the situations of strife, pain, brokenness and violence in
            which we find ourselves. We will work to create opportunities for genuine forgiveness and
            grace, even as we promote and defend justice, expecting the day when we will be reconciled
            together with all things to God in Christ.</font></p>
            <p><u><font face="Arial">We Act with Integrity and Accountability </font></u></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">In all that we do, we seek to act with integrity, openness, honesty
            and accountability. We recognize that the financial and material resources with which we
            work are not our own, but have been entrusted to us for use in alleviating the suffering
            of others. We value people as reflections of God's image, and we strive for integrity and
            accountability in our relationships with donors, staff and partners. We commit to managing
            these resources with God's direction to the maximum benefit of those we serve. </font></p>
            <p><u><font face="Arial">We Pursue Excellence</font></u></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">To ensure excellence in our programs and activities, we strive to
            attract talented, honest and committed people, to develop our staff, and to seek
            partnership with other leaders in Total Health. Through research, planning and
            participatory decision-making, we will design and implement effective programs with
            meaningful impact. We will set measurable goals and objectives to accomplish our plans.</font></p>
            <p><u><font face="Arial">We Desire to Learn </font></u></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">We recognize our responsibility to strive for a better understanding
            of the social, economic, political and spiritual elements of our ministry. To gain this
            understanding, we will be students of the cultures, environments and contexts within which
            we work, investigating and learning from developments and trends, and engaging in
            disciplined research and study. We will promote a learning environment where critical
            thinking and dialogue are encouraged and celebrated.</font></font></p>
