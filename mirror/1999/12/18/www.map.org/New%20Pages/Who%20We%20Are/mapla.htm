        <p><a name="Regional Situation"><font size="4"><b>Regional Situation</b></font></a></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Health problems in Latin America can no longer be approached
        solely from the perspective of traditional medical care. The political, economic,
        demographic, and sociocultural changes that have occurred on the continent over the past
        three decades have led to a highly complex health situation.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">That is the assessment of the Pan American Health Organization
        (PAHO). PAHO identifies governments, institutions, and citizens themselves as those
        responsible for developing a strategy that views health promotion as a social good. MAP
        Latin America has been working to expand the definition of health to include physical,
        social, spiritual, emotional and cultural for several years. And MAP has identified the
        church as a key institution in this work. The church has the manpower, the grass roots
        organization, regional coordination and the moral obligation to be involved in issues of
        social justice and health. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">The church faces a number of struggles, however, in its ability
        to respond to these health needs. They include:</font><ul>
          <li><font color="#000000">Increase in poverty and social problems.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#000000">A lack of participation on the part of the church to deal with
            these issues.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#000000">A lack of unity among Christian organizations and a lack of
            coordinated efforts to respond to the needs of Christian leaders.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#000000">The lack of economic resources and coordination of efforts to
            promote social development and holistic health.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font color="#000000">MAP seeks to empower church-based organizations with the tools
        needed to promote approaches to community health, family health, AIDS care and prevention
        and leadership development. To that end, MAP is creating strategies to allow it to build
        bridges, encourage opportunities for the exchanging of experiences, and to walk alongside
        Christian leaders working to promote and defend life in the 22 countries of Latin America.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000">Four years ago, Julio almost died. Dr. María Teresa helped save
        him. He now is helping to save his family. With the doctor's encouragement, Julio left his
        village the next year to receive training as one of the first holistic health promoters at
        MAP's training center in Bolivia. Since then, his house, gardens and lifestyle have become
        a model for his Quechua community in the highlands of Bolivia. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Not only has Julio implemented many of the concepts which he
        learned in MAP's training courses, his neighbors are beginning to try some of his ideas.
        Julio's training focused on using &quot;appropriate technology&quot; in five different
        ways: physical health, nutrition, income generation, family and community relations, and
        education methods. Today his neighbors can see what he learned through the vegetables he
        grows in his organic garden, the rabbits he raises to provide protein for his family, the
        way he keeps his house and grounds free from potential health risks, and the healthy
        relationships between members of his family. They also see it through his involvement in
        local vaccination campaigns and the health information he gives to his friends.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="4">AIDS<br>
        </font><font color="#000000">MAP Latin America has developed several working strategies in
        HIV/AIDS since 1992. MAP seeks to mobilize God's people in Latin America to confront the
        epidemic of HIV/AIDS in three ways: production of a quarterly AIDS Bulletin, production of
        an educational packet for women, and promotion of AIDS networks. The AIDS Bulletin and
        educational materials transmit methodologies which present alternatives for addressing the
        AIDS problem from different Latin American contexts.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Total Health Communication<br>
        </strong>To accomplish its mission in Latin America, MAP needs to know where the church is
        heading. Therefore, contacts have been established with key Christian leaders throughout
        the continent through participation in congresses, seminars, and workshops. The next
        challenge will be to proclaim MAP's vision of the social responsibility of the church
        through the media.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Christian Transformation Networks<br>
        </strong>This program emerges from the need for organizations and individuals to
        collaborate in the name of church unity. Being a part of genuine reconciliation within the
        Body of Christ is also a goal for MAP. Through the various national Christian
        Transformation Networks, MAP is able to foment union between people, non-governmental
        organizations and churches to develop joint actions which promote holistic health. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Leadership<br>
        </strong>Many of the region's problems lack answers due to a leadership crisis. In
        response, MAP helped to provide training for indigenous leaders in Caliata, Ecuador, and
        then shared this workshop with other developing country leaders gathered in the United
        States. In Santiago, Chile, MAP explored new ways to encourage reconciliation with members
        of the Pentecostal Studies Center of the Methodist Church. At the First Baptist Church of
        Concepción, Chile, MAP discussed the holistic mission of the church using biblical models
        based on service.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Community Development<br>
        </strong>MAP is working through the church to provide holistic health and health care
        services in Cochabamba, Bolivia, and Siguatepeque, Honduras. In Bolivia, MAP's
        Comprehensive Health Training Center has already trained over 140 holistic health
        promoters in areas of physical health, nutrition, income generation, inter-relational
        health, and educational methods. Besides working with the local Medical University and
        non-profit organizations in the area, the training centers provide continuing education
        courses for organizations and Christians interested in adopting the materials produced.
        With MAP's help, Hospital Evangélico in Honduras has trained over 400 people in courses
        at churches and schools, in the Nurse Auxiliary Training Center, in Bible Institutes and
        in the community. Both of these training efforts include community outreach programs for
        rural and marginal urban areas which are models for other organizations working in their
        regions.</font></p>

        <p align="center"><b>Mauricio Solis Paz</b></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">There are many challenges Latin-American Christians must face to
        accomplish their calling to be the salt and light of the continent. To work in the midst
        of a context of increasing poverty makes their mission a harder task, yet it does not mean
        it is impossible. The promotion of holistic health is more necessary every day. Thus we
        feel the calling to be promoters of a complete life -- in a physical, emotional, social,
        cultural and political sense. Christian organizations, individuals and congregations must
        coordinate their efforts. MAP-LA wants to build bridges, promote unity and facilitate
        reconciliation which will allow the Church to more effectively fulfill its holistic
        mission. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">MAP-LA can't do this by itself. We need your time, ideas,
        prayers, experience and material resources. We offer you a great opportunity to join with
        us by sharing the gifts you have been given by God to help serve people in need throughout
        the region. Give us your hand and take ours; come near, we want to know you and build
        together new bridges of hope.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><em>Mauricio Solís Paz has been the regional director of MAP
        Latin America since 1995. A Honduran, he now lives in Quito, Ecuador, with his wife,
        Patricia, and three children. He has a degree in psychology from the National University
        in Honduras and a specialty in community development</em>.</font></p>
