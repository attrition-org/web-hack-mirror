<h2 align="center">Starting a Travelers Aid Program in Your Community </h2>

<p align="center"><img SRC="bluebar.gif" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="8"> </p>

<p><i><b><font COLOR="#ff0000">Do persons find themselves stranded in your community?</font>
&nbsp;</b></i>Perhaps someone came into your community for a job that did not materialize;
maybe their car broke down; a spouse during a trip abandoned them; or, they were a victim
of a crime. A woman might find herself the victim of domestic violence. &nbsp;She is
without resources at a time when she needs to get back to her parents who are hundreds of
miles away. <i><b>&nbsp;<font COLOR="#ff0000">Where do these people turn for help?</font></b></i>
</p>

<p><font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>TRAVELERS AID</b></font> has been around for nearly 150 years
helping stranded and disconnected people. &nbsp;We help the homeless and others who are
disconnected from their traditional support systems. &nbsp;We are in airports and on skid
row. <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>TRAVELERS AID</b></font> agencies are multi-faceted human
service organizations rooted in their communities and with a variety of programs for the
homeless, job training, education, medical assistance, and human service advocacy. </p>

<p>It is difficult to start an entirely new non-profit organization, but if you are an <b>established
human service agency</b> in a community that has the kinds of social services needs noted
above, we can help you start a <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>TRAVELERS AID</b></font> program.
In many communities without a Travelers Aid agency, <font COLOR="#008000"><b>Transportation
Assistance</b></font> is not provided by established human service organizations - or
perhaps it is being handled piecemeal by several organizations. <font COLOR="#000080"><b>TRAVELERS
AID INTERNATIONAL </b></font>can give you the tools you need to establish (or consolidate
a variety of ) Transportation Assistance Program and connect you to the National Network
of <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>TRAVELERS AID</b></font> agencies and programs. &nbsp;If you
decide to start a <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>TRAVELERS AID </b></font>program, we will be
there to help you. &nbsp;Your membership in <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>TRAVELERS AID</b></font>
International will assure that you are connected to the Network, and we can even assign
you a mentor to ease you through those start up jitters. </p>

you with information on how to get started.</b></font> </p>
