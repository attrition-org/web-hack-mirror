  <LI>
    KidsCall is a joint effort that <B>Travelers Aid International</B> and
    <B>AT&amp;T</B> began in 1992 to encourage young people who have left home
    to re-establish contact with their home community. Travelers Aid has been
    working for 150 years to help people who are away from home and have no resources
    of their own.
  <LI>
    The ultimate goal of KidsCall is to encourage runaway youth to reconnect
    with their home community and make a transition to a safer, healthier life.
    If the young person decides to return home (or to another supportive
    environment), Travelers Aid is the best agency in the community to help him
    or her get there safely.
  <LI>
    Should the young person choose not to return home, Travelers Aid can offer
    other supportive services and, if necessary make referrals to other agencies
    for assistance.
  <LI>
    KidsCall differs from other runaway hotline programs in that the call will
    be placed from a Travelers Aid location. A Travelers Aid staff person will
    be immediately available to help, should the young person decide it is time
    to make a change.
  <LI>
    The runaway youth does not need to call a parent or guardian -- who is often
    the very reason for leaving home. They are often leaving environments of
    neglect, family conflict, and physical or sexual abuse.
  <LI>
    AT&amp;T pays for the calls that a young person makes from a Travelers Aid
    location. &nbsp;
  <LI>
    Recent government reports estimate that there are 1.3 million runaway youth
    in the United States. There are no accurate counts on the number of "throwaway"
    children, those who are left to fend for themselves because their parents
    and guardians have pushed them from the home and do not care where they are
    or what they do.
