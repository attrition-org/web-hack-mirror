Where do people in a desperate situation turn when they are isolated in a
strange city? Who will help the elderly, the confused, the mentally and
physically ill, the unemployed, the migrant, the family with small children:
here with no place to go and in need of immediate help?
<h3>
  <font COLOR="#0000ff">Travelers Aid is the answer.</font>
</h3>
<p>
Our workers in Travelers Aid are trained to give emergency service to people
who find themselves lost, desperate and often penniless in our community.
Our program helps them plan for immediate needs and the near future; how
to get medical or mental health service, shelter and food. Some of these
people encounter problems because they are in the process of moving from
one town to another. Many are on the move because they have psychological
or relationship problems, others are in search of a job, attracted by the
fame of the Daytona Beach area and convinced that with all the tourists
attractions in Florida there will be jobs for them. They come alone or with
innocent young children.
<p>
Travelers Aid tries to help people plan a course of action that is best for
them, to return home, continue to their destination or settle here; which
ever is the best choice.

<b>SERVICE PROFILES</b>
<p>
<i>A mother, age 22 with two children ages 3 and 14 months, in Daytona Beach
eight days and staying in a motel on U.S. 1. Her husband left &quot;to look for
work&quot; and he never returned. The motel has not been paid. She is stranded
with no money whatsoever. Although her mother in another state is anxious
to have her daughter come and live with her, she has no money to get her
home. Travelers Aid helped with the purchase of the bus fares and arranged
for food on the trip for the children.</i>
<p>
<i>A gentleman, age 73 who is physically ill left on unauthorized leave from
his boarding home in another state. He came to Daytona Beach because he had
visited here when he was younger. Travelers Aid contacted his landlady and
an attorney who were able to pay for his bus fare home.</i>
<p>
<b>KIDSCALL PROGRAM</b>
<p>
A FREE long distance phone call is available to runaway youth at the Travelers
Aid office.
<p>
The program is designed to encourage young people who have run away to
re-establish contact with their home community. The call does not have to
be parents and can be to any supportive adult in their hometown.
<p>
The call must be made from the Travelers Aid office but there are no strings
attached. KIDSCALL is a joint effort of Travelers Aid International and
AT&amp;T.
