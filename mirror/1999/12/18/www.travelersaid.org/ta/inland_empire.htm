<p>
Founded in 1984 as a program of Travelers Aid Society of Los Angeles, Travelers
Aid of the Inland Empire is the leading agency in Ontario providing assistance
to stranded individuals and families. In 1992, Travelers Aid became an
independent non-profit agency and is primarily funded by City of Los Angeles
Department of Airports, the City of Ontario, the Friends of Ontario International
Airport, the J.L. White Foundation, the Association of Airport Employees,
and Inland Container Foundation.

To meet the goal of serving those in need, Travelers Aid provides comprehensive
case management services to all of its clients. The philosophy of Travelers
Aid is to work with people in crisis by developing a case plan aimed at reuniting
them with their families and resources. People are fully evaluated to determine
specific needs and problems. A case aid then works with the individual and
follows through until those needs are met. Staff and volunteers from the
community implement the following programs:
