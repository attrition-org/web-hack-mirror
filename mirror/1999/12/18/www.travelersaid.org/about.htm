  <FONT COLOR="#0000a0">Travelers Aid International, through its network of
  45 member agencies and more than 500 cooperating representatives, serves
  individuals and families in crisis due to homelessness, mobility or other
  disruptive circumstances. In 1996, Travelers Aid International member agencies
  assisted more than 2 million people. In-depth services including housing,
  transportation assistance and case work were provided to more than 125,000
  individuals.<BR>
  <BR>
  The first Travelers Aid was founded in 1851 in St. Louis, which makes Travelers
  Aid the oldest, non-sectarian social welfare movement in America. While most
  Americans know of Travelers Aid through its information and referral booths
  in airports or bus stations, Travelers Aid agencies serve those in need in
  many ways. Vocational training for international refugees, transitional housing
  for homeless families, assistance in securing employment for newcomers to
  the community, outreach to homeless teens, aid in securing disability
  entitlements and health care for homeless people are all ways in which Travelers
  Aid International members work to help people make a transition to more stable,
  productive lives. <BR>
  <BR>
  Crucial to the work of local Travelers Aid agencies is the historic network
  of service through which an agency assisting a client requesting help with
  travel can ensure that there is proper support for the client in the destination
  community. A significant part of the work of Travelers Aid International
  is expanding and maintaining this network of agencies. Toward this end, Travelers
  Aid International carries on a seventy-eight year old tradition of providing
  national leadership and service to local agencies. <BR>
  <BR>
  In addition, Travelers Aid International works to strengthen its local agencies
  through providing training and technical assistance, developing program standards
  and disseminating information about funding availability and program development.
  Travelers Aid International also provides its local agencies a voice in the
  Nation's Capital for advocacy in the development of social policy. Changes
  in social policy in recent years makes the work of Travelers Aid even more
  important for clients who often fall through the cracks with other social
  service agencies.<BR>
  <BR>
  For nearly 150 years, Travelers Aid agencies in America have provided assistance
  to individuals and families who find themselves in crisis with nowhere else
  to turn. As the national voice for the Travelers Aid movement, Travelers
  Aid International works to ensure that those in need can receive professional
  help in making the transition back to a stable life.</FONT><B><BR>
