<b>Our Goals:</b><ul>
<li>to end illegal immigration;<br>
<li>to set legal immigration at the lowest feasible levels consistent with the demographic,
economic, social, and environmental realities of the present.</ul><p>

<b>Our Objectives:</b><ul>
<li>to develop a better understanding of the causes and effects of immigration through research
and policy analysis;<br>
<li>to inform leaders in academe, government, and the media, as well as the public at large;<br>
<li>to influence public policy directly by lobbying (to the extent permitted by our tax status) and
by protecting the public's rights in the courts.</ul><p>

<b>FAIR believes:</b><ul>
<li>that illegal immigration can and must be substantially reduced by humane measures that are
consistent with our democratic ideals;<br>
<li>that immigration should not be permitted to undermine opportunities for America's poor and
disadvantaged to improve their working conditions and wages;<br>
<li>that our immigration laws must be fairly and effectively enforced; there should be no
favoritism toward or discrimination against any person on the basis of race, color, or national
origin;<br>
<li>that all admissions of the foreign born come within a single, stable ceiling which is periodically
reviewed on the basis of reasoned, explicit population goals for the United States.<br>
<li>that three criteria should guide selection of immigrants: (1) our fair share of refugees, with ultimate resettlement a key part of the program (2) our national manpower policy, and (3) concerns for reunification of nuclear families;<br>
<li>that the United States should not contribute to a brain drain that entices away the skilled and
talented who are desperately needed in their homelands; we should meet our need for skilled
professionals by training and retraining our own;<br>
<li>that the United States should make greater efforts to encourage population stablilization, economic
development, and alleviation of poverty worldwide and especially in countries of great
migration;<br>
<li>that the era of mass international migration as a solution to national problems has come to an
end; problems of poverty and overpopulation must be vigorously confronted where people live,
rather than postponing their solution by either the export or the importation of masses of people;
<li>that determining its own immigration and population policy is the sovereign right and
responsibility of every nation.<p>
