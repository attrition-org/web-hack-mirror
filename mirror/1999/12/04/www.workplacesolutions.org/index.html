The ADMIN of this site should show a little more concern for security.  I have left
details on how I got in, e-mail me if you have any questions.<br>
<br>
One thing I was reading about was Zyklon's unfortunate raid and then arrest.
He has to now spend more than enough time in jail, and pay alot of money
which the government will probably spend on putting a few dozen traces on his
phone lines.  I'd just like to say that is absolutely pathetic, we all need a
new justice system.<br>
I recently read on <a href="http://www.hackernews.com">Hacker's 
News Network</a> that some defacer got raided.  They knew where to find him because the Hotmail 
staff helped them locate him while he was using Hotmail.  Hotmail is the number 1
visited web-page, and as one staff member at hackernews.com put it so nicely, "when will people learn?".
Most hackers/crackers claim to hate Microsoft, and turn right around to use their service, way to go.
Besides, Hotmail sucks.  Use <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Mail</a>.

The first person I have to show most respect to is Nemesystm of DHC.  This
guy is one of the most computer literate people I have ever come across yet
does not boast about it.  And another good thing is that he's professional in everything he does.
He has defaced many web-sites, yet I cannot remember one website where he has 
used anything obscene (eg. swear word, picture).  He is a true hacker.
Thanks for everything Nemesystm.<br><br>
v00d00.  Now here's another great hacker.  This guy doesn't think he's all that, 
even though he is.  He also helps out alot.  Thanks.<br><br>
