<H3><A NAME="overview">An Overview of the Capitol and Its
Function</A></H3>

<P>The United States Capitol is among the most architecturally
impressive and symbolically important buildings in the world.  It
has housed the meeting chambers of the Senate and the House of
Representatives for almost two centuries.  Begun in 1793, the
Capitol has been built, burnt, rebuilt, extended, and restored;
today, it stands as a monument not only to its builders but also
to the American people and their government.</P>

<P>As the focal point of the government's Legislative Branch, the
Capitol is the centerpiece of the Capitol Complex, which includes
the six principal Congressional office buildings and three
Library of Congress buildings constructed on Capitol Hill in the
19th and 20th centuries.</P>

<P>In addition to its active use by Congress, the Capitol is a
museum of American art and history.  Each year, it is visited by
an estimated 3-5 million people from around the world.</P>

<P>A fine example of 19th-century neoclassical architecture, the
Capitol combines function with aesthetics.  Its designs derived
from ancient Greece and Rome evoke the ideals that guided the
nation's founders as they framed their new republic.  As the
building was expanded from its original design, harmony with the
existing portions was carefully maintained.</P>

<P>Today, the Capitol covers a ground area of 175,170 square
feet, or about 4 acres, and has a floor area of approximately
16-1/2 acres.  Its length, from north to south, is 751 feet 4
inches; its greatest width, including approaches, is 350 feet. 
Its height above the base line on the east front to the top of
the Statue of Freedom is 288 feet; from the basement floor to the
top of the dome is an ascent of 365 steps.  The building contains
approximately 540 rooms and has 658 windows (108 in the dome
alone) and approximately 850 doorways.</P>

<P>The building is divided into five levels.  The first, or
ground, floor is occupied chiefly by committee rooms and the
spaces allocated to various congressional officers.  The areas
accessible to visitors on this level include the Hall of Columns,
the <A Href="../art/brumcorr.htm">Brumidi Corridors</A>, the restored <A
Href="../rooms/oldsuprc.htm">Old Supreme Court Chamber</A>, and the Crypt
beneath the Rotunda, where historical exhibits are presented.</P>

<P>The second floor holds the Chambers of the House of
Representatives (in the south wing) and the Senate (in the north
wing) as well as the offices of the congressional leadership. 
This floor also contains three major public areas.  In the center
under the dome is the <A Href="../rooms/rotunda.htm">Rotunda</A>, a
circular ceremonial space that also serves as a gallery of
paintings and sculpture depicting significant people and events
in the nation's history.  The Rotunda is 96 feet in diameter and
rises 180 feet 3 inches to the canopy.  The semicircular chamber
south of the Rotunda served as the Hall of the House until 1857;
now designated <A Href="../rooms/nsh_hall.htm">National Statuary Hall</A>,
it houses part of the Capitol's collection of statues donated by
the states in commemoration of notable citizens.  The <A
Href="../rooms/oldsench.htm">Old Senate Chamber</A> north-east of the
Rotunda, which was used by the Senate until 1859, has been
returned to its mid-19th-century appearance.</P>

<P>The third floor allows access to the galleries from which
visitors to the Capitol may watch the proceedings of the House
and the Senate when Congress is in session.  The rest of this
floor is occupied by offices, committee rooms, and press
galleries.</P>

<p>The fourth floor and the basement/terrace level of the Capitol
are occupied by offices, machinery rooms, workshops, and other
support areas.</P>

<H3><A NAME="location">The Location of the Capitol</A></H3>

<P>The Capitol is located at the eastern end of the Mall on a
plateau 88 feet above the level of the Potomac River, commanding
a westward view across the Capitol Reflecting Pool to the
Washington Monument 1.4 miles away and the Lincoln Memorial 2.2
miles away.  The geographic location of the head of the Statue of
Freedom that surmounts the Capitol dome is described by the
National Geodetic Survey as latitude 38 degrees 53 minutes
23.31098 seconds north and longitude 77 degrees 00 minutes
32.62262 seconds west.</P>

<p>Before 1791, the federal government had no permanent site. 
The early Congresses met in eight different cities: 
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Lancaster, York, Princeton, Annapolis,
Trenton, and New York City.  The subject of a permanent capital
for the government of the United States was first raised by
Congress in 1783; it was ultimately addressed in Article I,
Section 8 of the Constitution (1787), which gave the Congress
legislative authority over &quot;such District (not exceeding ten
Miles square) as may, by Cession of Particular States, and the
Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the
United States. . . .&quot;</P>

<p>In 1788, the state of Maryland ceded to Congress &quot;any
district in this State, not exceeding ten miles square,&quot; and
in 1789 the state of Virginia ceded an equivalent amount of land. 
In accordance with the &quot;Residence Act&quot; passed by
Congress in 1790, President Washington in 1791 selected the area
that is now the District of Columbia from the land ceded by
Maryland (private landowners whose property fell within this area
were compensated by a payment of &#163;25 per acre); that ceded
by Virginia was not used for the capital and was returned to
Virginia in 1846.  Also under the provisions of that Act, he
selected three Commissioners to survey the site and oversee the
design and construction of the capital city and its government
buildings.  The Commissioners, in turn, selected the French
engineer Pierre Charles L'Enfant to plan the new city of
Washington.  L'Enfant's plan, which was influenced by the gardens
at Versailles, arranged the city's streets and avenues in a grid
overlaid with baroque diagonals; the result is a functional and
aesthetic whole in which government buildings are balanced
against public lawns, gardens, squares, and paths.  The Capitol
itself was located at the elevated east end of the Mall, on the
brow of what was then called Jenkins' Hill.  The site was, in
L'Enfant's words, &quot;a pedestal waiting for a
monument.&quot;</P>

<H3><A NAME="plan">The Selection of a Plan</A></H3>

<P>L'Enfant was expected to design the Capitol and to supervise
its construction.  However, he refused to produce any drawings
for the building, claiming that he carried the design &quot;in
his head&quot;; this fact and his refusal to consider himself
subject to the Commissioners' authority led to his dismissal in
1792.  In March of that year the Commissioners announced a
competition, suggested by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson,
that would award $500 and a city lot to whoever produced
&quot;the most approved plan&quot; for the Capitol by mid-July. 
None of the 17 plans submitted, however, was wholly satisfactory. 
In October, a letter arrived from <A
Href="../aoc/aocs_bio.htm#thornton">Dr. William Thornton</A>, a
Scottish-trained physician living in Tortola, British West
Indies, requesting an opportunity to present a plan even though
the competition had closed.  The Commissioners granted this
request.</P>

<p>Thornton's plan depicted a building composed of three
sections.  The central section, which was topped by a low dome,
was to be flanked on the north and south by two rectangular wings
(one for the Senate and one for the House of Representatives). 
President Washington commended the plan for its &quot;grandeur,
simplicity and convenience,&quot; and on April 5, 1793, it was
accepted by the Commissioners; Washington gave his formal
approval on July 25.</P>

<p>Photographs of a <a href="../history/model_t.htm">model showing Thornton's
design</a>,
including his modifications of ca. 1797, are available (three .jpg images totaling 21k).

<H3><A NAME="construc">A Brief Construction History</A></H3>

<H4><A NAME="17931829">1793-1829</A></H4>

<P>The cornerstone was laid by President Washington in the
building's southeast corner on September 18, 1793, with Masonic
ceremonies.  Work progressed under the direction of three
architects in succession.  Stephen H. Hallet (an entrant in the
earlier competition) and George Hadfield were eventually
dismissed by the Commissioners because of inappropriate design
changes that they tried to impose; James Hoban, the architect of
the White House, saw the first phase of the project through to
completion.</P>

<p>Construction was a laborious and time-consuming process:  the
sandstone used for the building had to be ferried on boats from
the quarries at Aquia, Virginia; workers had to be induced to
leave their homes to come to the relative wilderness of Capitol
Hill; and funding was inadequate.  By August 1796 the
Commissioners were forced to focus the entire work effort on the
building's north wing so that it at least could be ready for
government occupancy as scheduled.  Even so, some third-floor
rooms were still unfinished when the Congress, the Supreme Court,
the Library of Congress, and the courts of the District of
Columbia occupied the Capitol in late 1800.</P>

<p><a name="latrobe">In 1803, Congress allocated funds to resume construction.  A
year earlier, the office of the Commissioners had been abolished
and replaced by a Superintendent of the City of Washington.  To
oversee the renewed construction effort, <A
Href="../aoc/aocs_bio.htm#latrobe">Benjamin Henry Latrobe</A> was
appointed architect.  The first professional architect and
engineer to work in America, Latrobe modified Thornton's plan for
the south wing to include space for offices and committee rooms;
he also introduced alterations to simplify the construction work.

<p>Photographs of a <a href="../history/model_l.htm">model showing
Latrobe's design</a> are available (three .jpg images totaling 26k).

<p>Latrobe began work by removing a squat, oval, temporary building
known as &quot;the Oven,&quot; which had been erected in 1801 as
a meeting place for the House of Representatives.  By 1807
construction on the south wing was sufficiently advanced that the
House was able to occupy its new legislative chamber, and the
wing was completed in 1811.</P>

<p>In 1808, as work on the south wing progressed, Latrobe began
the rebuilding of the north wing, which had fallen into
disrepair.  Rather than simply repair the wing, he redesigned the
interior of the building to increase its usefulness and
durability; among his changes was the addition of a chamber for
the Supreme Court.  By 1811 he had completed the eastern half of
this wing, but funding was being increasingly diverted to
preparations for a second war with Great Britain.  By 1813,
Latrobe had no further work in Washington and so he departed,
leaving the north and south wings of the Capitol connected only
by a temporary wooden passageway.</P>

<p>The War of 1812 left the Capitol, in Latrobe's later words,
&quot;a most magnificent ruin&quot;:  on August 24, 1814, British
troops set fire to the building, and only a sudden rainstorm
prevented its complete destruction.  Immediately after the fire,
Congress met for one session in Blodget's Hotel, which was at
Seventh and E Streets, N.W.  From 1815 to 1819, Congress occupied
a building erected for it on First Street, N.E., on part of the
site now occupied by the Supreme Court Building.  This building
later came to be known as the Old Brick Capitol.</P>

<p>Latrobe returned to Washington in 1815, when he was rehired to
restore the Capitol.  In addition to making repairs, he took
advantage of this opportunity to make further changes in the
building's interior design (for example, an enlargement of the
Senate Chamber) and introduce new materials (for example, marble
discovered along the upper Potomac).  However, he came under
increasing pressure because of construction delays (most of which
were beyond his control) and cost overruns; finally, he resigned
his post in November 1817.</P>

<p><a name="bulfinch">On January 8, 1818, <A
Href="../aoc/aocs_bio.htm#bulfinch">Charles
Bulfinch</A>, a prominent Boston architect, was appointed
Latrobe's successor.  Continuing the restoration of the north and
south wings, he was able to make the chambers for the Supreme
Court, the House, and the Senate ready for use by 1819.  Bulfinch
also redesigned and supervised the construction of the Capitol's
central section.  The copper-covered wooden dome that topped
this section was made higher than Bulfinch considered appropriate
to the building's size (at the direction of President James
Monroe and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams).  After
completing the last part of the building in 1826, Bulfinch spent
the next few years on the Capitol's decoration and landscaping. 
In 1829, his work was done and his position with the government
was terminated.  In the 20 years following Bulfinch's tenure, the
Capitol was entrusted to the care of the Commissioner of Public
Buildings.</P>

<p>Photographs of a <a href="../history/model_b.htm">model showing
the Capitol as completed by Bulfinch</a> are available
(three .jpg images totaling 24k).



<H4><A NAME="18301868">1830-1868</A></H4>

<P>The Capitol was by this point already an impressive structure. 
At ground level, its length was 351 feet 7-1/2 inches and its
width
was 282 feet 10-1/2 inches.  Up to the year 1827--records from
later years being incomplete--the project cost was $2,432,851.34. 
Improvements to the building continued in the years to come
(running water in 1832, gas lighting in the 1840s), but by 1850
its size could no longer accommodate the increasing numbers of
senators and representatives from newly admitted states.  The
Senate therefore voted to hold another competition, offering a
prize of $500 for the best plan to extend the Capitol.  Several
suitable plans were submitted, some proposing an eastward
extension of the building and others proposing the addition of
large north and south wings.  However, Congress was unable to
decide between these two approaches, and the prize money was
divided among five architects.  Thus, the tasks of selecting a
plan and appointing an architect fell to President Millard
Fillmore.</P>

<p>Fillmore's choice was <A Href="../aoc/aocs_bio.htm#walter">Thomas U.
Walter</A>, a Philadelphia architect who had entered the
competition.  On July 4, 1851, in a ceremony whose principal
oration was delivered by Secretary of State Daniel Webster, the
President laid the cornerstone for the northeast corner of the
House wing in accordance with Walter's plans.  Over the next 14
years, Walter supervised the construction of the extensions,
ensuring their compatibility with the architectural style of the
existing building.  However, because the Aquia Creek sandstone
used earlier had already deteriorated noticeably, he chose to use
marble for the exterior.  For the veneer, Walter selected marble
quarried at Lee, Massachusetts, and for the columns he used
marble from Cockeysville, Maryland.</P>

<p>Walter faced several significant challenges during the course
of construction.  Chief among these was the steady imposition by
the government of additional tasks without additional pay.  Aside
from his work on the Capitol extensions and dome, Walter designed
the wings of the Patent Office building, extensions to the
Treasury and Post Office buildings, and the Marine barracks in
Pensacola and Brooklyn.  When the Library of Congress in the
Capitol's west central section was gutted by a fire in 1851,
Walter was commissioned to restore it.  He also encountered
obstacles in his work on the Capitol extensions.  His location of
the legislative chambers was changed in 1853 at the direction of
President Franklin Pierce, based on the suggestions of the newly
appointed supervising engineer, Captain Montgomery C. Meigs.  In
general, however, the project progressed rapidly:  the House of
Representatives was able to meet in its new chamber on December
16, 1857, and the Senate first met in its present chamber on
January 4, 1859.  The old House chamber was later designated
National Statuary Hall.  In 1861, most construction was suspended
because of the Civil War, and the Capitol was used briefly as a
military barracks, hospital, and bakery.  In 1862, work on the
entire building was resumed.</P>

<p>As the new wings were constructed, more than doubling the
length of the Capitol, it became apparent that the dome erected
by Bulfinch no longer suited the building's proportions.  In 1855
Congress voted for its replacement based on Walter's design for a
new, fireproof <A Href="../rooms/dome.htm">cast-iron dome</A>.  The old
dome was removed in 1856, and 5,000,000 pounds of new masonry was
placed on the existing Rotunda walls.  Iron used in the dome
construction had an aggregate weight of 8,909,200 pounds and was
lifted into place by steam-powered derricks.</P>

<p>In 1859 Thomas Crawford's plaster model for the <A
Href="../art/freedom.htm"> Statue of Freedom</A>, designed for the top
of the dome, arrived from the sculptor's studio in Rome.  With a
height of 19 feet 6 inches, the statue was almost 3 feet taller
than specified, and Walter was compelled to make revisions to his
design for the dome.  When cast in bronze by Clark Mills at his
foundry on the outskirts of Washington, it weighed 14,985 pounds. 
The statue was lifted into place atop the dome in 1863, its final
section being installed on December 2 to the accompaniment of gun
salutes from the forts around the city.</P>

<p>The work on the dome and the extensions was completed under
the direction of <A Href="../aoc/aocs_bio.htm#clark">Edward Clark</A>,
who had served as Walter's assistant and was appointed Architect
of the Capitol in 1865 after Walter's resignation.  In 1866, the
Italian-born artist Constantino Brumidi finished the canopy
fresco, a monumental painting entitled <cite>The Apotheosis of 
Washington</cite>.  The Capitol extensions were completed in 1868.</P>

<H4><A NAME="18691902">1869-1902</A></H4>

<P>Clark continued to hold the post of Architect of the Capitol
until his death in 1902.  During his tenure, the Capitol
underwent considerable modernization.  Steam heat was gradually
installed in the Old Capitol.  In 1874 the first elevator was
installed, and in the 1880s electric lighting began to replace
gas lights.</P>

<p>Between 1884 and 1891, the marble terraces on the north, west,
and south sides of the Capitol were constructed.  As part of the
<a href="../grounds/grounds.htm">grounds</a> plan devised by landscape
architect Frederick Law
Olmsted, these terraces not only added over 100 rooms to the
Capitol but also provided a broader, more substantial visual base
for the building.</P>

<p>On November 6, 1898, a gas explosion and fire in the original
north wing dramatically illustrated the need for fireproofing. 
The roofs over the Statuary Hall wing and the original north wing
were reconstructed and fireproofed, the work being completed in
1902 by Clark's successor, <A Href="../aoc/aocs_bio.htm#woods">Elliott
Woods</A>.  In 1901 the space in the west central front vacated
by the Library of Congress was converted to committee rooms.</P>

<H4><A NAME="19031970">1903-1970</A></H4>

<P>During the remainder of Woods' service, which ended with his
death in 1923, no major structural work was required on the
Capitol.  The activities performed in the building were limited
chiefly to cleaning and refurbishing the interior.  <A
Href="../aoc/aocs_bio.htm#lynn">David Lynn</A>, the Architect of the
Capitol from 1923 until his retirement in 1954, continued these
tasks.  Between July 1949 and January 1951, the corroded roofs
and skylights of both wings and the connecting corridors were
replaced with new roofs of concrete and steel, covered with
copper.  The cast-iron and glass ceilings of the House and Senate
chambers were replaced with ceilings of stainless steel and
plaster, with a laylight of carved glass and bronze in the middle
of each.  The House and Senate chambers were completely
remodeled, improvements such as modern air conditioning and
lighting were added, and acoustical problems were solved.  During
this renovation program, the House and Senate vacated their
chambers on several occasions so that the work could
progress.</P>

<p>The next significant modification made to the Capitol was the
east front extension.  This project was carried out under the
supervision of Architect of the Capitol <A
Href="../aoc/aocs_bio.htm#stewart">J. George Stewart</A>, who served
from 1954 until his death in 1970.  Begun in 1958, it involved
the construction of a new east front 32 feet 6 inches east of the
old front, faithfully reproducing the sandstone structure in
marble.  The old sandstone walls were not destroyed; rather, they
were left in place to become a part of the interior wall and are
now buttressed by the addition.  The marble columns of the
connecting corridors were also moved and reused.  Other elements
of this project included repairing the dome, constructing a
subway terminal under the Senate steps, reconstructing those
steps, cleaning both wings, birdproofing the building, providing
furniture and furnishings for the 90 new rooms created by the
extension, and improving the lighting throughout the building. 
The project was completed in 1962.  Subsequent work in the 1960s
was concentrated chiefly on the construction of the 
<a href="../ofcbldgs/rhob.htm">Rayburn House
Office Building</a> and on the maintenance and repair of the
Capitol.</P>

<H4><A NAME="1971pres">1971-Present</A></H4>

<P>Since the 1971 appointment of <A Href="../aoc/aocs_bio.htm#white">George M.
White, FAIA</A>, as Architect of the Capitol, the building has been both modernized
and restored.  Electronic
voting equipment was installed in the House chamber in 1973;
facilities were added to allow television coverage of the House
and Senate debates in 1979 and 1986, respectively; and improved
climate control, electronic surveillance systems, and new
computer and communications facilities have been added to bring
the Capitol up to date.  The Old Senate Chamber, National
Statuary Hall, and the Old Supreme Court Chamber, on the other
hand, were restored to their mid-19th-century appearance for the
nation's 1976 Bicentennial celebration.</P>

<p>In 1983, work began on the strengthening, renovation, and
preservation of the west front of the Capitol.  Structural
problems had developed over the years because of defects in the
original foundations, deterioration of the sandstone facing
material, alterations to the basic building fabric (a
fourth-floor addition and channeling of the walls to install
interior utilities), and damage from the fires of 1814 and 1851
and the 1898 gas explosion.</P>

<p>To strengthen the structure, over one thousand stainless steel
tie rods were set into the building's masonry.  More than 30
layers of paint were removed, and damaged stonework was repaired
or replicated.  Ultimately, 40% of the sandstone blocks were
replaced with limestone.  The walls were treated with a special
consolidant and then painted to match the marble wings.  The
entire project was completed in 1987, well ahead of schedule and
under budget.</P>

<p>A related project, completed in January 1993, effected the
repair of the Olmsted terraces, which had been subject to damage
from settling, and converted the terrace courtyards into several
thousand square feet of meeting space.</P>

<p>As the Capitol enters its third century, restoration and
modernization work continues.  Major projects include
conservation of the Rotunda canopy and frieze and the Statue of
Freedom, creation of murals in three first-floor House corridors,
and replacement of worn <a href="../art/minton.htm">Minton tiles</a> in the Senate
corridors. 
Permanent television broadcasting facilities have been installed
in the Senate Chamber, and the subway system linking the Capitol
with the <a href="../ofcbldgs/dsob.htm">Dirksen</a> and 
<a href="../ofcbldgs/hsob.htm">Hart Senate Office Buildings</a> has been
replaced with a new system.  Repair and restoration of the House
monumental stairs was completed in 1996.  A program of barrier removal begun in the 1970s
continues
in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Planning
and design work for a Capitol Visitor Center is under way; the
Center, subject to authorization and funding, will be located
under the East Front Plaza and will contain exhibits, orientation
displays, theaters, and other facilities to make the visitor's
experience in the Capitol more informative and meaningful.</P>
