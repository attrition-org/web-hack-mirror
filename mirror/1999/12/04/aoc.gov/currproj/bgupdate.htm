<h3>Preparatory Work</h3>

<p>On September 1, 1997, at 5 p.m. the U.S. Botanic Garden Conservatory officially closed for a
period of about three years to undergo extensive renovation and reconstruction.  Educational
programs previously announced in the 1997 Calendar of Events, including the fall and winter
flower shows, have been canceled.  <a href="../usbg/offsite99.htm">Off-site programs</a> will be
announced at this Web site as information becomes available.

<p>The Conservatory staff carefully removed plants from the display halls. Many were moved
to the U.S. Botanic Garden's production facility, where they will remain until replanting begins in
the year 2000. Some of the plants not slated for display after renovation were given to
educational and nonprofit institutions.  More detailed information is available for those who
would like to know <a href="../currproj/plantrem.htm">what happened to all those plants</a>.

<p>In the months of October and November 1997, a construction fence was erected around the
Conservatory to protect the building.  The fence has been decorated with two exhibits of botanical
murals.  The first, <a href="../usbg/fence.htm">&quot;Kids Paint the World of Plants,&quot;</a>
featured the work of children from the Washington, D.C., area.  The second, 
<a href="../usbg/fence2.htm">&quot;Kids View the World of Plants,&quot;</a> consists of more
than 215 pictures created by children from 41 states and the District of Columbia; it was installed
in April 1999.

<p>An <a href="../usbg/overview.htm">overview of the Garden's history and function</a> and 
photographs of the <a href="../usbg/bg_front.htm">Conservatory</a> (90k .jpg) and the <a
href="../usbg/palmhous.htm">former Palm House interior</a> (83k .jpg) are available.

<h3>About the Renovation and Reconstruction</h3>

<p>The renovation and reconstruction of the 1933 Conservatory will totally replace and
modernize its building systems while retaining its architectural character.  Aside from a modest
addition at the rear of the building, its exterior will be largely unchanged from its 1933
appearance. The Conservatory's aluminum framework, glazing, interior floors, doors, and lighting
will be replaced; all electrical, plumbing, and environmental control systems will be upgraded; and
air conditioning will be added to the display halls and the Orangerie. The renovation will make the
Conservatory totally accessible and provide improved visitor services, such as enlarged restroom
facilities and an expanded gift shop.  All interior areas will feature newly designed plant and
educational exhibits.  The most readily visible element of the project will be the reconstructed
Palm House, the central structure that will rise over 80 feet to crown the Conservatory.

<p>Fact sheets about the Conservatory Renovation and the 
<a href="../currproj/ng.htm">National Garden project</a> are available upon request from the
U.S. Botanic Garden, (202) 225-8333.

<h3>The Botanic Garden is Still Open</h3><a name="bartholdipark">

<p>Visitors to the Botanic Garden will continue to be welcomed in the USBG's Bartholdi Park,
named for the sculptor of its historic fountain. The park features a series of thematic
demonstration gardens suitable for the urban or suburban home site.  Changing seasonal display
beds feature outstanding annuals and perennials.  The dramatic focal point of the park is 
<a href="../usbg/barthold.htm">Bartholdi Fountain</a>, which was originally created for the
1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, moved to the Capitol Grounds in 1877, and erected in
its present site in 1932.  Tours of the park are available upon request.
