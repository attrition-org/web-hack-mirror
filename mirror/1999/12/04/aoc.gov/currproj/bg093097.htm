<H2>Renovation and Reconstruction of the U.S. Botanic Garden Conservatory</h2>

<p>On September 1, 1997, at 5 p.m. the U.S. Botanic Garden Conservatory officially closed for a
period of about three years to undergo extensive renovation and reconstruction.  Educational
programs previously
announced in the 1997 Calendar of Events, including the fall and winter flower shows, have been
canceled.  <a href="../usbg/offsite.htm">Off-site programs</a> will be announced at this Web site
as information becomes available.

<p>The Conservatory staff is now in the process of carefully removing plants from the display
halls. The plants are being moved to the U.S. Botanic Garden's growing facility at D.C. Village,
where they will remain until replanting begins in the year 2000. Some of the plants not slated for
display after renovation have been given to nonprofit educational institutions in the area. 
Maintenance crews have begun to remove interior fixtures and landscaping stone.

<p>In the months of October and November, a construction fence will be erected around the
Conservatory to protect the building.  The fence will be decorated with botanical murals painted
by area school children.

<p>An <a href="../usbg/overview.htm">overview of the Garden's history and function</a> and 
photographs of the <a href="../usbg/bg_front.htm">Conservatory</a> (90k .jpg) and the <a
href="../usbg/palmhous.htm">former Palm House interior</a> (83k .jpg) are available.

<h3>About the Renovation and Reconstruction</h3>

<p>The renovation and reconstruction of the 1933 Conservatory will totally replace and
modernize its building
systems while retaining its architectural character.  Aside from a modest addition at the rear of the
building, its exterior will be largely unchanged from its 1933 appearance. The Conservatory's
aluminum framework, glazing, interior floors, doors, and lighting will be replaced; all electrical,
plumbing, and environmental control systems will be upgraded; and air conditioning will be added
to the display halls and the Orangerie. The renovation will make the Conservatory totally
accessible and provide improved visitor services, such as enlarged restroom facilities and an
expanded gift shop.  All interior areas will feature newly designed plant and educational exhibits. 
The most readily visible element of the project will be the reconstructed Palm House, the central
structure that will rise over 80 feet to crown the Conservatory.

<p>Fact sheets about the Conservatory Renovation and the 
<a href="../currproj/ng.htm">National Garden project</a> are available upon request from the
U.S. Botanic Garden, (202) 225-8333.

<h3>The Botanic Garden is Still Open</h3><a name="bartholdipark">

<p>Visitors to the Botanic Garden will continue to be welcomed in the USBG's Bartholdi Park,
named for the sculptor of its historic fountain. The park features a series of thematic
demonstration gardens suitable for the urban or suburban home site.  Changing seasonal display
beds feature outstanding annuals and perennials.  The dramatic focal point of the park is 
<a href="../usbg/barthold.htm">Bartholdi Fountain</a>, which was originally created for the
1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, moved to the Capitol Grounds in 1877, and erected in
its present site in 1932.  Tours of the park are available upon request.
