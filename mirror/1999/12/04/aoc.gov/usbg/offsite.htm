<H2>Update on U.S. Botanic Garden Programs</h2>

<p>On September 1, 1997, at 5 p.m. the U.S. Botanic Garden Conservatory officially closed for a
period of about three years to undergo extensive 
<a href="../currproj/bgupdate.htm">renovation</a>.  Although educational programs previously
announced in the 1997 Calendar of Events, including the fall and winter flower shows, have been
canceled, off-site programs will be offered as described below.  In addition, visitors continue to be
welcome in the USBG's <a href="../currproj/bgupdate.htm#bartholdipark">Bartholdi Park</a>.
