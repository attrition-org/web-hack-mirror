<h2>An Overview of the United States Botanic Garden</h2>

<p><strong>The United States Botanic Garden</strong> was established by the
Congress in 1820 and is the oldest botanic garden in North America.  It is a living plant
museum dedicated to demonstrating the aesthetic, cultural, economic, therapeutic, and
ecological importance of plants to the well-being of humankind.   Public facilities include
the <strong>Conservatory</strong>, <strong>Bartholdi Park</strong>, and, in the
future, the <strong>National Garden</strong>.  The grounds of the Botanic Garden are
located on the National Mall across from the U. S. Capitol along First Street, S.W.,
between Maryland Avenue and C Street.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Conservatory</strong>, a historic landmark of the nation's capital,
opened in 1933.   In 1996, more than 730,000 visitors attended four annual flower
shows and enjoyed displays of exotic plants from tropical, subtropical, and desert
regions worldwide.  (Photographs of the <a href="../usbg/bg_front.htm">
Conservatory</a> [90k .jpg] and the <a href="../usbg/palmhous.htm">former Palm
House interior</a> [83k .jpg] are available.)
<br>
<br>
<strong>NOTICE:  On September 1, 1997, at 5 p.m. the U.S. Botanic Garden
Conservatory officially closed for a period of about three years to undergo extensive <a
href="../currproj/bgupdate.htm">renovation and reconstruction</a>.  Educational programs
previously
announced in the 1997 Calendar of Events, including the fall and winter flower shows,
have been canceled.  <a href="../usbg/offsite.htm">Off-site programs</a> will be
announced at this Web site as information becomes available.</strong></li>
<br>
<br>
<li><strong>Bartholdi Park</strong>, named for the sculptor of its historic fountain, is
a garden demonstration landscape.  Each garden is of a size and scale suitable for the
urban or suburban home site.  The gardens illustrate design principles and display plant
combinations for a variety of themes and styles.  Changing seasonal display beds feature
outstanding annuals and perennials.  <a href="../usbg/barthold.htm">Bartholdi
Fountain</a>, originally created for the Centennial Exposition of 1876 in Philadelphia,
was moved to the Capitol Grounds in 1877 and to this site in 1932.  Visitors are welcome in the
park every day of the year.  The Administration Building for the Botanic Garden (not open to the
public) is also located here.</li>
<br>
<br>
<li><a href="../currproj/ng.htm"><strong>The National Garden</strong></a> will be
constructed beginning in 1998 on the three acres of lawn adjacent to the Conservatory.  
Funds for its design and construction have been raised from private donations and
revenue-producing activities of the National Fund for the U.S. Botanic Garden, a
nonprofit 501c3 membership organization.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Services</strong> of the U. S. Botanic Garden include a plant information
hotline, an educational outreach program, and growing of plants for the beautification of
Capitol Hill.  Under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, the
USBG is a designated rescue center and repository for plants seized in illegal trade
activities.

<h3>The History of the U.S. Botanic Garden</h3>

<p>The United States Botanic Garden traces its beginning to 1816, when the
constitution of the Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences in
Washington, D.C., proposed the creation of a botanic garden to collect, grow, and
distribute plants of this and other countries that might contribute to the welfare of the
American people.  The Institute's garden was established by Congress in 1820 to the
west of the Capitol Grounds, extending from First Street to Third Street between
Pennsylvania and Maryland Avenues.  This facility functioned until shortly after the
organization stopped holding meetings in 1837.</p>

<p>In 1842, the idea of a national botanic garden was reestablished when the return of
the United States Exploring Expedition to the South Seas (the Wilkes Expedition)
brought to Washington a collection of living plants from around the globe.  Placed
initially in a specially constructed greenhouse behind the Old Patent Office Building, the
plants  were moved in late 1850 into a new structure on the site previously occupied by
the Columbian Institute's garden.</p>

<p>The Garden was moved to its present main location at First Street and Maryland
Avenue, S.W., in 1933.  This facility includes a conservatory and 2 acres of outside
grounds.  Across Independence Avenue are the Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Auguste
Bartholdi Park, an outdoor display area, and an administration building.  A plant
production facility newly constructed in Anacostia includes greenhouse bays and a
support facility.  Plans are under way to use three acres directly west of the conservatory
as the National Garden, which is being funded by the <!--<a href="../info/tobgfund.htm"
target="_top">-->National Fund for the United States Botanic Garden<!--</a>-->.</p>

<p>The <a href="../pages/aoc_page.htm">Architect of the Capitol</a> has served as
Acting Director of the United States Botanic Garden since 1934.  Under the direction of
the Joint Committee on the Library, which is charged by law with control over the
Garden, the Architect is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Garden
and for any construction, changes, or improvements made.</p>
