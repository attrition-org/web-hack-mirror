<H3><a name=descript>A Description of the Grounds</a></H3>

<P>Originally a wooded wilderness, the U.S. Capitol Grounds today
provide a park-like setting for the Nation's Capitol, offering a
picturesque counterpoint to the building's formal architecture. 
The
grounds immediately surrounding the Capitol are bordered by a
stone wall
and cover an area of 58.8 acres.  Their boundaries are
Independence
Avenue on the south, Constitution Avenue on the north, First
Street
NE/SE on the east, and First Street NW/SW on the west.  Over 100
varieties of trees and bushes are planted around the Capitol, and
thousands of flowers are used in seasonal displays.  In contrast
to the
building's straight, neoclassical lines, most of the walkways in
the
grounds are curved.  Benches along the paths offer pleasant spots
for
visitors to appreciate the building, its landscape, and the
surrounding
areas, most notably the Mall to the west.</P>

<P>The grounds were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted
(1822-1903), who
planned the expansion and landscaping of the area that was
performed
from 1874 to 1892.  Olmsted, who also designed New York's Central
Park,
is considered the greatest American landscape architect of his
day.  He
was a pioneer in the development of public parks in America, and
many of
his designs were influenced by his studies of European parks,
gardens,
and estates.  In describing his plan for the Capitol grounds,
Olmsted
noted that &quot;The ground is in design part of the Capitol, but in
all
respects subsidiary to the central structure.&quot;  Therefore, he was
careful not to group trees or other landscape features in any way
that
would distract the viewer from the Capitol.  The use of sculpture
and
other ornamentation has also been kept to a minimum.</P>

<p>An <a href="../history/wf_2.htm">aerial photograph</a>

the grounds around the Capitol is available.</p>

<P>Many of the trees on the Capitol grounds have historic or
memorial
associations.  Among the oldest is the &quot;Cameron Elm&quot; near the
House
entrance.  This tree was named in honor of the Pennsylvania
Senator who
ensured its preservation during Olmsted's landscaping project. 
Other
trees commemorate members of Congress and other notable citizens,
national organizations, and special events.  In addition, over 30
states
have made symbolic gifts of their state trees to the Capitol
grounds. 
Many of the trees on the grounds bear plaques that identify their
species and their historic significance.  The eastern part of the
grounds contains the greatest number of historic and
commemorative
trees.</P>

<P>At the East Capitol Street entrance to the Capitol Plaza are
two
large rectangular stone fountains.  The bottom levels now contain
plantings, but at times in the past they have been used to catch
the
spillover from the fountains.  At other times, both levels have
held
plantings.  Six massive red granite lamp piers topped with light
fixtures in wrought-iron cages, and 16 smaller bronze light
fixtures,
line the paved plaza.  Seats are placed at intervals along the
sidewalks.  Three sets of benches are enclosed with wrought-iron
railings and grilles; the roofed bench was originally a shelter
for
streetcar passengers.</P>

<P>The northern part of the grounds offers a shaded walk among
trees,
flowers, and shrubbery.  A small, hexagonal brick structure named
the
<a href="../grounds/sumhouse.htm">Summer House</a> may be found in the
north-west corner of the
grounds.  This
structure contains shaded benches, a central ornamental fountain,
and
three public drinking fountains.  In a small grotto on the
eastern side
of the Summer House, a stream of water flows and splashes over
rocks to
create a pleasing sound and cool the summer breezes.</P>

<H3><a name=before>A Brief History of the Grounds Before
Olmsted</a></H3>

<P>The land on which the Capitol stands was first occupied by the
Manahoacs and the Monacans, who were subtribes of the Algonquin
Indians.
 Early settlers reported that these tribes occasionally held
councils
not far from the foot of the hill.  This land eventually became a
part
of Cerne Abbey Manor, and at the time of its acquisition by the
federal
government it was owned by Daniel Carroll of Duddington.</P>
<P>The &quot;Residence Act&quot; of 1790 provided that the federal
government
should be established in a permanent location by the year 1800. 
In
early March 1791 the Commissioners of the City of Washington, who
had
been appointed by President George Washington, selected the
French
engineer Pierre Charles L'Enfant to plan the new federal city. 
L'Enfant
decided to locate the Capitol at the elevated east end of the
Mall (on
what was then called Jenkins' Hill); he described the site as &quot;a
pedestal waiting for a monument.&quot;</P>

<P>At this time the site of the Capitol was a relative wilderness
partly overgrown with scrub oak.  Oliver Wolcott, a signer of the
Declaration of Independence, described the soil as an
&quot;exceedingly stiff
clay, becoming dust in dry and mortar in rainy weather.&quot;  A muddy
creek
with swampy borders flowed at the base of the hill, and an alder
swamp
bordered by tall woods occupied the place where the <a
href="../pages/usbgpage.htm">United States Botanic
Garden</a> now
stands.  The city's inhabitants, like L'Enfant and Washington,
expected
that the capital would grow to the east, leaving the Capitol and
the
White House essentially on its outskirts.  For some years the
land
around the Capitol was regarded as a common, crossed by roads in
several
directions and intended to be left as an open area.</P>

<P>In 1825 a plan was devised for imposing order on the Capitol
grounds, and it was carried out for almost 15 years.  The plan
divided
the area into flat, rectangular grassy areas bordered by trees,
flower
beds, and gravel walks.  The growth of the trees, however, soon
deprived
the other plantings of nourishment, and the design became
increasingly
difficult to maintain in light of sporadic and small
appropriations. 
John Foy, who had charge of the grounds during most of this
period, was
&quot;superseded for political reasons,&quot; and the area was then
maintained
with little care or forethought.  Many rapidly growing but
short-lived
trees were introduced and soon depleted the soil; a lack of
proper
pruning and thinning left the majority of the area's vegetation
ill-grown, feeble, or dead.  Virtually all was removed by the
early
1870s, either to make way for building operations during Thomas
U.
Walter's enlargement of the Capitol or as required by changes in
grading
to accommodate the new work on the building or the alterations to
surrounding streets.</P>

<H3><a name=olmsted>The Olmsted Plan</a></H3>

<P>The <a href="../history/cap_hist.htm#18301868">mid-19th-century extension
of the Capitol</a>, in which the House
and Senate wings and the new dome were added, required also that
the
Capitol grounds be enlarged, and in 1874 Frederick Law Olmsted
was
commissioned to plan and oversee the project.  As noted above,
Olmsted
was determined that the grounds should complement the building.  (A <a
href="../grounds/olmsplan.htm">photograph</a>
(56k .jpg) of
Olmsted's
plan is available.) 
In
addition, he addressed an architectural problem that had
persisted for
some years:  from the west the direction in which the city was
clearly
growing the earthen terraces at the building's base made it seem
inadequately supported at the top of the hill.  The solution,
Olmsted
believed, was to construct marble terraces on the north, west,
and south
sides of the building, thereby causing it to &quot;gain greatly in the
supreme qualities of stability, endurance, and repose.&quot;  He
submitted
his design for these features in 1875, and after extensive study
it was
approved.</P>

<P>Work on the grounds began in 1874, concentrating first on the
east
side and then progressing to the west, north, and south sides in
1875. 
First, the ground was reduced in elevation.  Almost 300,000 cubic
yards
of earth and other material were eventually removed, and over 200
trees
were transplanted.  New sewer, gas, and water systems were
installed. 
The soil was then enriched with fertilizers to provide a suitable
growth
medium for new plantings.  Paths and roadways were graded and
their
foundations were laid.</P>

<P>By 1876, gas and water service was completed for the entire
grounds,
and electrical lamp-lighting apparatuses had been installed. 
Stables
and workshops had been removed from the northwest and southwest
corners.
 A streetcar system north and south of the west grounds had been
relocated farther from the Capitol, and ornamental shelters were
in
place at the north and south car-track termini.  The granite and
bronze
lamp piers and ornamental bronze lamps for the east plaza area
were
completed.</P>

<P>Work accelerated in 1877.  By this time, according to
Olmsted's
report, &quot;altogether 7,837 plants and trees [had] been set out.&quot; 
However, not all had survived:  hundreds were stolen or destroyed
by
vandals, and, as Olmsted explained, &quot;a large number of cattle
[had] been
caught trespassing.&quot;  Other work met with less difficulty. 
Foot-walks
were laid with artificial stone, a mixture of cement and sand,
and
approaches were paved with concrete.  An ornamental iron trellis
had
been installed on the northern east-side walk, and another was
under way
on the southern walk.  An underground air duct for ventilating
the Hall
of the House was laid to a temporary opening in the west side of
the
hill.</P>

<P>The 1878 appointment of watchmen to patrol the grounds was
quite
effective in preventing further vandalism, allowing the lawns to
be
completed and much shrubbery to be added.  Also in that year, the
roads
throughout the grounds were paved.</P>

<P>Most of the work required on the east side of the grounds was
completed by 1879, and effort thus shifted largely to the west
side. 
The Pennsylvania Avenue approach was virtually finished, and work
on the
Maryland Avenue approach had begun.  The stone walls on the west
side of
the grounds were almost finished, and the red granite lamp piers
were
placed at the eastward entrance from Pennsylvania Avenue.</P>

<P>In the years 1880-82, many features of the grounds were
completed. 
These included the walls and coping around the entire perimeter,
the
approaches and entrances, the tower for the
House air shaft, and
the
Summer House.  Work on the terraces began in 1882, and most work
from
this point until 1892 was concentrated on these structures.</P>

<P>In 1885, Olmsted retired from superintendency of the terrace
project; he continued to direct the work on the grounds until
1889. 
Landscaping work was performed to adapt the surrounding areas to
the new
construction, grading the ground and planting shrubs at the bases
of the
walls, as the progress of the masonry work allowed.  Some trees
and
other types of vegetation were removed, either because they had
decayed
or as part of a careful thinning-out process.</P>

<P>In 1886, Olmsted recommended that the Senate side of the
Capitol be
supplied with fresh air through a duct and tower similar to those
on the
House side.  This project was completed in 1889-90.  In 1888, the
wrought-iron lamp frames and railings were placed at the Maryland
Avenue
entrance, making it the last to be completed.  In 1892, the
streetcar
track that had extended into grounds from Independence Avenue was
removed.</P>

<H3><a name=after>The Grounds After Olmsted</a></H3>

<P>In the last years of the 19th century, work on the grounds
consisted
chiefly of maintenance and repairs as needed.  Trees, lawns, and
plantings were tended, pruned, and thinned to allow their best
growth. 
This work was quite successful:  by 1894, the grounds were so
deeply
shaded by trees and shrubs that Architect of the Capitol Edward
Clark
recommended an all-night patrol by watchmen to ensure public
safety.  A
hurricane in September 1896 damaged or destroyed a number of
trees,
requiring extensive removals in the following year.  Also in
1897,
electric lighting replaced gas lighting in the grounds.</P>

<P>Between 1910 and 1935, 61.4 acres north of Constitution Avenue
was
added to the grounds.  Approximately 100 acres was added in
subsequent
years, bringing the total area to 274 acres.  In 1981, the
Architect of
the Capitol developed the Master Plan for future development of
the U.S.
Capitol grounds and related areas.</P>

<P>Since 1983, increased security measures have been put into
effect,
including the installation of barriers at vehicular entrances. 
However,
the area still functions in many ways as a public park, and
visitors are
welcome to use the walks to tour the grounds.  Demonstrations and
ceremonies are often held on the grounds.  During the summer,
many
high-school bands perform in front of the Capitol, and a series
of
evening concerts by the bands of the armed forces is offered free
of
charge on the east front plaza.  On various holidays, concerts by
the
National Symphony Orchestra are held on the west front lawn.</P>
