          “The key to the game yesterday was the quick start we had, both
          offensively and defensively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Defensively,
          we were three-and-out in the first five series’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>The first five series defensively we dominated and we had two
          turnovers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The takeaways
          gave the offense great field position, and we got 10 points from them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Offensively, we had three touchdowns and three field goals in
          seven series’ in the first half.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We came out and made things happen, and scored points early.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>The five takeaways were a big factor in the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Three of them were inside the 10-yard line, and another was on
          the 17-yard line.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We had two significant plays that happened in the game early.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>We were up 27-3 and we got the ball with 1:22 left in the half.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>We were going to go into a two minute mode, but yet we didn’t
          want to give them anything back at that time to give them any
          momentum.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We took it down and got a field goal to make it 30-3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Then we come out in the second half, and throw an eighty yard
          touchdown pass to Terrence Wilkins on the first play to make it 37-3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>The drive at the end of the half to give us three points, and
          then coming out with the very first play to Terrence kind of put
          things out of reach. Those were some of the real good things that
          happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">“I
          would also like to mention that we had some good players that were not
          able to play because of injuries and other circumstances, and we had
          some other players that hadn’t played a whole lot, and they stepped
          in and played very well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One
          of them was Jeff Saturday, who played the whole game at left guard for
          (injured) Steve McKinney.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jeff
          played a really fine football game for us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>He had played once before with us against the Jets, but this is
          the first time he had played this much at all, and he played very
          well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Isaac Jones went in
          as our third receiver because of the injuries to E.G. Green and Jerome
          Pathon, and he had a number of plays.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>He blocked well, and did a good for what we asked him to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Bradford Banta played the most he has played this year at tight
          end, and did an excellent job blocking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Paul Shields played quite a bit at fullback, but we actually
          asked him to go in and play some at tight end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>He was off the ball when he played tight end, and he had to
          learn his assignments late in the week when we felt like we wouldn’t
          have a good chance to get Kenny (Dilger) to play.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>We felt like we didn’t want to get out of the two tight end
          set so we put Paul up there, and taught him some plays, and he did an
          excellent job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marcus
          Pollard had to play more than he ever had before and he did a nice
          job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Defensively, Billy
          Austin went in and played safety in our dime situation, and did a nice
          job.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Billy hadn’t played much, and he went in and played well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Mark Thomas played a lot more at left end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Those guys coming in and doing a good job for us were a big
          factor in the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">“We
          jumped out to a big lead, and didn’t really falter.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We talked about getting up on people, and not letting them
          back in the ballgame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
          the fourth quarter, we started playing a lot of different people, a
          lot of substitutes and backups.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
          all went in and did a pretty good job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>We did have three turnovers, which I wasn’t happy with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>But overall, I thought the players that went in and played a
          significant amount for the first time did a good job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Maybe that experience will come handy as we go through the rest
          of the season.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
          didn’t have any major injuries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>We might have a couple of guys who might not be able to go full
          speed during practice early in the week, but I think everybody should
          be able to play Sunday that played last Sunday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>We should get E.G. Green back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

          been coaching in this league for a number of years, and I hardly ever

          Yes. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I didn’t expect us
          to be 8-2 after 10 games.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
          go into every season optimistic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Every coach and organization does because you never know how
          you’re going to do over the course of a season.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>But after coming off a 3-13 season last year, we are still a
          relatively young team with some new players, a new defensive system
          and a second-year quarterback.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
          knew we would be better and I expected us to be better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>If someone would have told me we would be 8-2 after 10 games, I
          would have taken it right then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
          would have said, ‘Great, let’s go.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>I really didn’t anticipate we would have this record after 10
          games.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We’ve had some
          games that could have went either way, but that’s how it is in this
          business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We’ve won
          eight and I pleased with that, but we have some tough games coming up
