          “Every team’s goal is to make the playoffs. Once you make the
          playoffs, then you have a chance to win it all. That doesn’t change.
          We’ve still got to try to do that. And it’s not going to be easy,
          it’s going to be difficult.”</font><b>

          the improvement of the Colts defense)<br>
          “We had a lot further to go defensively than offensively. I knew we
          would get better and better as we felt more comfortable in the system.”</font></p>

          <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">HEAD COACH JIM MORA </font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">(on
          the defense)<br>
          “You lose (the turnover battle) zero to three, you don’t win very
          often. There’s different ways to win football games. You can’t
          just say that every time you come out minus you’re going to lose.
          There’s so many different circumstances every game - who you’re
          playing, what their strengths are, what you’re strengths are. Over
          the long haul, if you end up minus-three, you’re chances of winning
          are slim.”</font></p>

          not taking this win for granted)<br>
          “Nobody else in the NFL is going to look at our seven wins (in a
          row) and be impressed. That we’re in first place is great. But you
          can’t take anything for granted. Every game is tough, really tough.
          We saw how tough today, that’s for sure.”</font></p>

          (on playing against the Jets)<br>
          “They’re just a tough, physical team and I think we are, too. I
          think both teams have respect for each other and when we match up, it’s
          going to be a fight. It was today and it was the first time we played

          their offensive problems against the Jets)<br>
          “They’re a veteran group, and they know what they’re doing. Any
          time you’ve got guys playing over there that have been around the
          league, it’s not going to be easy.”</font></p>

          the defense not allowing a TD)<br>
          “It’s good that we have a defense that will step up and meet the
          challenge. Our offense made turnovers and our defense stepped up
          there. That just says a lot about this ballclub.”</font></p>

          “The first time we played them, we were flat-out lucky to win. This
          one, we felt like we were the better team. We made it tougher than it
          needed to be.”</font></p>

          realizing that they still have mistakes to correct)<br>
          “It’s easy to talk big right now. In some ways, to win a game like
          this is healthy because we realize that we have to do more to get
          better. We can’t beat the Miami’s and other teams making these
          kinds of mistakes.”</font></p>

          being a complete football team)<br>
          “We’re a complete football team. Both sides of the ball come to
          play every single Sunday. All of our victories have been team
          victories. We put the defense in a bind early on, fumbling the ball
          and giving (the Jets) an easy three points.”</font></p>

          winning the game and realizing that improvements can be made)<br>
          “It’s nice to be able to win and know you still have room for
          improvement. If there is any good news in this, it’s that we won on
          an off-day. Don’t get me wrong. We played really hard, but we didn’t
          play smart enough. We’re in first place and that gives us an
          opportunity. But it’s all about doing it, not just talking about it.
          We know it’s going to be a grind.”</font></p>

          his two interceptions)<br>
          “It was frustrating because I knew that, just one more score at any
          point, and we had put them away for good. Every time we’d get to
          their 30-yard line, I’d tell our guys, ‘OK, come on now, let’s
          get the ball in the end zone and finish them off.’ But give them
          credit for keeping us out and blame us, I guess, for not completing
          the job. We just kept doing stupid stuff, really.”</font></p>

          <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">DE-MARK THOMAS </font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">(on
          the play of the defense)<br>
          “I think this week is the building of a championship defense. I
          think you’ve got to have games where the game is on the line and the
          offense doesn’t do great - when it doesn’t put up 30 points. When
          that happens, and your offense is struggling, and the game is in your
          hands as a defensive player, that’s when championship defenses are
          made. That’s what it’s all about.”</font></p>
          <b>
          <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">DE-MARK THOMAS </font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">(on
          the Colts 9-2 record)<br>
          “Coming from where this team was last year, the struggles it had, we
          couldn’t be in a better situation. We couldn’t ask for a better
          scenario. I feel like a little kid again. It’s great to be having
          the success we’re having. But the key is, it’s not over. If we
          lose the rest of the games, it doesn’t mean anything. If we don’t
          get to the playoffs, if we don’t reach our goals, it doesn’t
          matter. We’ve got a long road ahead of us. If we continue to play
          well, the future is ours. There is no tomorrow, there is no next year,
          the future is now.”</font></p>

          how it felt to keep the Jets out of the end zone in the fourth
          quarter)<br>
          “Relief, I guess that’s the best way to describe it. Relief that
          it was over, and that we’d done it. The offense has been putting it
          up all year. It feels great to be on the defensive side of the ball,
          and have it on our shoulders in the last seconds, and step up and get
          that win.”</font></p>
          <b>
          <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">DB-CHAD COTA </font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">(on
          the Colts run defense against Jets RB-Curtis Martin)<br>
          “Run defense is a team effort and everybody has to partake in it. It
          was kind of surprising how they came out early throwing like they did,
          trying to light us up. They got a few on us, but after that we stepped
          up. The offense is sometimes not going to put up great numbers. It
          came down to our defense beating theirs and we did.”</font></p>

          <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">LB-CORNELIUS BENNETT </font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">(on
          the game)<br>
          “Anytime you play against Bill Parcells, you know it’s going to be
          a tough, physical ballgame. It was everything that it was set up to
          be. They had a big challenge coming into this game. They were fighting
          to stay alive. We just happened to pull this out. It takes all kinds
          to get to the championship level. There are some good ones and some
          bad ones. This one looked like a bad one, but we came out on top.”</font></p>

          (on the defense improving with each game)<br>
          “The last two weeks the defense has played extremely well. We played
          three quarters of shutout football today and that’s pretty good for
          a defense that people say is the Achilles’ heel of this team. We
          knew we had to go out and play hard and keep them out of the end zone.
          That just shows the character of this team. Guys never say never. They
          just keep fighting and clawing.”</font></p>

          “We are playing great right now. A lot of guys stepped up and made
          plays when they had to. It was a total team effort.”</font></p>

          “No matter what the result of the game is, we are going to work to
          get better. If we win by 25 points or win by three points, we are
          going to keep working to get better. We will correct our mistakes and
          focus this week on getting ready for Miami.”</font></p>
