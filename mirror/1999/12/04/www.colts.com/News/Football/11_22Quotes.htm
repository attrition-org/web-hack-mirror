          even better.”</font></p>

          the game)<br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">“Well, it was one of
          those days where things went well for us right off the bat. We got
          some turnovers early, and got really good field position. For the most
          part, we took advantage of that. We had some opportune things happen
          early, and we were able to make the most of it and get the lead.”</font></p>

          </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">“Edgerrin had a really
          good game today. I think he’s playing better all the time. He busted
          the big one there, he ran tough and he’s just a good football
          player. He’s protecting the football so much better than he was. He’s
          running hard and he’s talented.”</font></p>

          the talent level of this team)<br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">“We’ve got some
          talent on this team. You’re not going to win unless you have good
          players and we’ve got some good players. Bill Polian and Dom Anile
          have gotten us some good players to work with, and that’s the first
          step. We have good people that work hard and prepare well. We’ve got
          some good leadership on our team from people. We’ve got a young
          football team, but they have come together real quickly and they are
          playing well.”</font></p>

          being taken out of the game during the fourth quarter)<br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">“If it was going to
          happen, I’m glad it was because of a big lead. I’m glad it wasn’t
          because of an injury or because we were getting blown out. You’d
          love to have these games every single week, but they don’t happen
          very often. When they do, you enjoy them.”</font></p>
          <b>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">QB-PEYTON MANNING </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">(on
          the play of RB-Edgerrin James)<br>
          “Edgerrin is playing with so much more confidence and he’s letting
          his natural ability take over. The fact he is more involved in the
          passing game is just giving us a new dimension. It’s keeping
          defenses more off-balance. It gives them somebody else they’ve got
          to worry about.”</font></p>
          <b>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">QB-PEYTON MANNING </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">(on
          injuries forcing guys into the game for the first time)<br>
          “We really came out motivated today and I think it happened in the
          very beginning of the game. We had some injuries and we had some guys
          in there playing who hadn’t really played much before. But they
          really stepped up and played well.”</font></p>
          <b>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">QB-PEYTON MANNING </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">(on
          what motivates this team to get better)<br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">“I think that we are
          just really motivated to keep getting better. But every week in
          practice and every Monday watching the film, we still see a lot of
          things that we can do even better. That’s exciting and that’s
          encouraging. So, we feel like we have come back and worked hard in
          every practice, and tried to come out and play even better on Sunday.
          We have three huge games coming up in a row, three division games. It’s
          going to be a great challenge in the RCA Dome next Sunday against the
          Jets.”</font></p>

          playing in front of his hometown)<br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">“It just shows you we
          have a lot of different players who can make plays. It was a great
          feeling to come out and play the way we did. The Eagles are a great
          team and they’re going to get better, but right now it’s the Colts’
          time.”</font></p>

          running game with holes)<br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">“We just put it to ‘em
          however they want it. If they want to take Marvin away from us, we’ll
          run the ball. If they want to stop the run, we’ll take it deep.”</font></p>

          <p><font face="Times New Roman">RB-EDGERRIN JAMES </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">(on
          the 62-yard touchdown run)<br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">“Anybody could’ve
          scored on that. The offensive line did a great job. It was wide open.
          It kinda shocked me how open it was. The coach said all week we were
          going to do this one play and it was going to be open.”</font></p>

          <p><font face="Times New Roman">RB-EDGERRIN JAMES </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">(on
          the pressure of replacing Marshall Faulk)<br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">“Nobody puts more
          pressure on me than I put on myself. I want to do well. I’m in the
          NFL. This is my dream and I’ve always said that once I get to the
          NFL, I’m going to try to make the best out of it. Now every day I’m
          working and trying to get better because you never know how long it’s
          going to last. And you want to be remembered for being one of the
          great players of the NFL.”</font></p>
          <b>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">RB-EDGERRIN JAMES </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">(on
          if this was his best game)<br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">“No. My best game is
          yet to come.”</font></p>

          <p><font face="Times New Roman">LB-CORNELIUS BENNETT </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">(on
          the defense)<br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">“Right after we got
          introduced today, I told the guys, ‘Everybody knows about our
          offense. Let’s try to do the same with our defense and become known
          as a complete football team.’ I think we made the statement.”</font></p>
          <b>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">DE-CHAD BRATZKE </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">(on
          QB-Donovan McNabb)<br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">“We were bringing one
          or two extra guys whenever we could. McNabb’s got a great arm, he’s
          athletic, the things everybody knows. But he’s young and if you can
          get to him and make him make his decisions quick, that’s certainly
          an advantage. You’ve got to give credit to the entire defense. We
          played a really sound game today.”</font></p>
          <b>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">DE-CHAD BRATZKE </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">(on
          the team putting effort into the game even though they had a huge
          lead)<br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">“The team showed a lot
          of maturity coming out in the third quarter and keeping the killer
          instinct. That was something we talked about. It was important and
          that will carry a long way, being able to finish.”</font></p>
