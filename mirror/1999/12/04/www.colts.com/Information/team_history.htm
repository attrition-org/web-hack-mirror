        </div><p>Professional football came to Indianapolis March 28, 1984, when Colts owner
        Robert Irsay moved the historic NFL franchise from Baltimore to Indianapolis&#151;the
        friendly heart of the midwest. <br>
        The roots of the franchise go back to December 28, 1946, when the bankrupt Miami Seahawks
        of the All-America Football Conference were purchased and relocated in Baltimore by a
        group headed by Bob Rodenberg. As the result of a contest in Baltimore, won by Charles
        Evans of Middle River, Md., the team was renamed the &#147;Colts.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        On September 7, 1947, wearing green and silver uniforms, the Colts under Head Coach Cecil
        Isbell won their initial AAFC game, 16-7, over the Brooklyn Dodgers. The team concluded
        its inaugural season before a record Baltimore crowd of 51,583 losing to the New York
        Yankees, 21-7. The Colts finished the year with a 2-11-1 record good for a fourth-place
        finish in the Eastern Division.<br>
        The Colts completed the 1948 season with a 7-8 record, tying the Buffalo Bills for the
        division title. The Colts compiled a 1-11 slate in 1949. The All-American Football
        Conference and the National Football League merged in 1950 and the Colts became a member
        of the NFL. After posting a 1-11 record for the second consecutive year, the franchise was
        dissolved by the league on January 18, 1951, because of its failing financial condition.<br>
        <br>
        After two full seasons without professional football, NFL Commissioner Bert Bell
        challenged the franchise in December of 1952 to sell 15,000 season tickets within six
        weeks in order to re-enter the NFL. That 15,000-ticket quota was reached in four weeks and
        three days.<br>
        <br>
        On January 23, 1953, under the principal ownership of Carroll Rosenbloom, the NFL&#146;s
        Dallas Texans franchise was moved to Baltimore where, keeping the &#147;Colts&#148;
        nickname, the Texans team colors of blue and white were inherited.<br>
        Before their first NFL season, the &#147;new&#148; Baltimore Colts engineered one of the
        biggest trades in sports history. In a deal with the Cleveland Browns involving 15
        players, Baltimore received 10 Browns in exchange for five Colts. Among the players who
        came to Baltimore in the deal were Don Shula, Bert Rechichar, Carl Taseff and Art Spinney.
        These players helped the Colts open the 1953 NFL season with a 13-9 upset of the Chicago
        Bears in a game where Bert Rechichar set a then-NFL record with a 56-yard field goal.<br>
        <br>
        In 1954, the Colts hired Weeb Ewbank as head coach. Ewbank would guide the Colts for the
        next nine seasons (the longest tenure of any Colts head coach) and lead the club to two
        conference and world championships.<br>
        <br>
        On November 30, 1958, the Colts clinched their first Western Conference title with a 35-27
        win over San Francisco before a record home sellout crowd of 57,557. Four weeks later,
        Baltimore won its first World Championship, downing the New York Giants, 23-17, in the
        fabled &#147;sudden-death&#148; overtime contest at Yankee Stadium. The Colts repeated as
        champion in 1959, clinching their second Western Conference crown and defeating the
        Giants, 31-16, in Baltimore for the World Championship.<br>
        <br>
        In January, 1963, Don Shula replaced Weeb Ewbank as the team&#146;s third head coach since
        1953. During the 1963 campaign, quarterback John Unitas led the Colts offense to eight
        team records and set a then-NFL individual passing mark of 237 completions. The Colts won
        a club-record eleven consecutive games in 1964, enroute to clinching their third Western
        Conference title and first under Shula. During that campaign, Raymond Berry caught his
        506th career pass and Lenny Moore scored 20 touchdowns, both NFL records at the time. The
        following year, Baltimore tied Green Bay for the Western Conference title. With halfback
        Tom Matte quarterbacking the club because of injuries to John Unitas and Gary Cuozzo, the
        Colts lost a controversial 13-10 &#147;sudden-death&#148; playoff contest to the Packers.<br>
        <br>
        Under Shula, Baltimore made its first Super Bowl appearance in 1968. The club finished
        first in the Coastal Division with a 13-1 mark, then defeated Minnesota, 24-14, in the
        Western Conference Championship game and blanked Cleveland, 34-0, for the NFL
        Championship. The team went on to face the American Football League Champion New York Jets
        in Super Bowl III, losing a 16-7 upset.<br>
        <br>
        In May of 1969, the NFL merged with the AFL and Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Cleveland joined
        the old AFL teams to form the American Football Conference of the NFL. For the 1970
        season, the Colts were situated in the Eastern Division of the AFC and on September 20,
        the club won its first AFC game, 16-14, over San Diego. In mid-December, Baltimore
        clinched its first Eastern Division Championship with a 20-14 win at Buffalo, then
        defeated Cincinnati and Oakland in the playoffs to win the AFC Championship. On January
        17, 1971, the Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V, 16-13, on Jim
        O&#146;Brien&#146;s 32-yard field goal with five seconds remaining in the game.<br>
        <br>
        In July, 1972, the Colts came under new ownership as Robert Irsay acquired the club from
        Carroll Rosenbloom in exchange for the Los Angeles Rams.<br>
        In 1974, two young Colt stars established NFL records as running back Lydell Mitchell
        carried the ball 40 times against the New York Jets at Shea Stadium and quarterback Bert
        Jones completed 17 consecutive passes against the same Jets club later in the season.
        Mitchell set another mark that season, winning the league pass receiving title with 72
        receptions.<br>
        <br>
        In 1975, Mitchell would continue his record-setting pace by becoming the first running
        back in Colt history to rush for 1,000 yards, gaining 1,193 yards on 289 carries.<br>
        <br>
        After posting a 2-12 record in 1974, Baltimore&#146;s fortunes began to change with the
        hiring of Ted Marchibroda as head coach in February, 1975. Marchibroda led the Colts to
        three consecutive Eastern Division titles before posting back-to-back 5-11 seasons in 1978
        and 1979.<br>
        <br>
        The Colts named Mike McCormack to replace Marchibroda as head coach in January, 1980. The
        Colts improved to a 7-9 record in 1980 before recording the worst record in club history
        to date with a 2-14 slate in 1981.<br>
        <br>
        On December 21, 1981, the Colts named Frank Kush to replace McCormack as head coach. In
        addition, club owner Robert Irsay announced the appointment of Ernie Accorsi as general
        manager on May 16, 1982. <br>
        <br>
        Under Kush&#146;s guidance, the Colts recorded their first winning preseason record (3-2)
        since 1970. After two weeks of regular season play, a players&#146; strike resulted in the
        loss of seven games per team from the 1982 schedule, and each team played a nine-game
        schedule. The Colts finished the season with a record of 0-8-1.<br>
        <br>
        The Colts received the first selection in the April 26, 1983, NFL Draft and selected
        Stanford QB-John Elway. Six days later on May 2, the Colts traded Elway to Denver in
        exchange for the Broncos&#146; 1983 first-round choice, offensive tackle Chris Hinton,
        along with quarterback Mark Herrmann and Denver&#146;s first round choice in the 1983 NFL
        Draft.<br>
        <br>
        In 1983, the Colts forged the biggest turnaround in NFL history for a team that had gone
        winless the previous season. The 1983 Colts were 6-4 after week 10 and then went 7-9 on
        the season. Rookie Chris Hinton earned a starting berth at offensive guard for the AFC in
        the Pro Bowl. The Colts&#146; running game came together as Curtis Dickey and Randy
        McMillan combined for just shy of 2,000 yards rushing to rank first in the AFC and second
        in the NFL.<br>
        <br>
        Following the 1984 season, President Robert Irsay and General Manager Jim Irsay appointed
        Rod Dowhower as head coach on January 28, 1985. Dowhower posted a 5-11 mark that season
        with a club that rushed for a conference-leading 2,439 yards, fifth-best in the NFL. The
        team averaged 5.0 yards per attempt to lead the NFL, while marking the first time in a
        decade that an AFC team achieved that feat.<br>
        <br>
        On December 1, 1986, Ron Meyer succeeded Dowhower as head coach. Meyer led the club to the
        AFC Eastern Division title in 1987, before falling in the Divisional Playoffs.
        Indianapolis earned a 9-7 record in 1988 and an 8-8 mark in 1989, but lost playoff
        positions on the last weekend of each season. RB-Eric Dickerson, acquired in a blockbuster
        trade on October 31, 1987, won the NFL rushing title in 1988 with 1,659 yards. The Colts
        produced a 7-9 record in 1990. Meyer earned a 36-35 regular season record with the club
        before being succeeded by Rick Venturi on October 1, 1991. Ted Marchibroda returned to the
        Colts as head coach on January 28, 1992. Marchibroda led the Colts to a 9-7 record in
        1992, the second time he guided the team to an NFL-best eight-game one-season turnaround.
        The Colts posted a 4-12 record in 1993 and an 8-8 mark in 1994.<br>
        <br>
        The 1995 Colts earned a 9-7 record, then posted playoff wins at San Diego and Kansas City.
        The team dropped a 20-16 decision at Pittsburgh in the AFC Championship Game.
        Marchibroda&#146;s tenure with the club ended on February 9, 1996. His 73 career victories
        tied Don Shula for most by a Colts head coach. Lindy Infante succeeded Marchibroda on
        February 15, 1996. The Colts earned a 9-7 record in 1996, qualifying for the playoffs in
        consecutive seasons for the first time since 1975-77. Bill Polian was named president on
        December 22, 1997, one day after the club finished a 3-13 season. Jim Mora succeeded
        Infante as head coach on January 12, 1998. The Colts were 3-13 in 1998, but received solid
        performances from RB-Marshall Faulk and QB-Peyton Manning. Faulk&#146;s 2,227 yards from
        scrimmage set a club record, while Manning (326-575-3,739, 26 TDs) set NFL rookie records
        in every passing category.<br>
        <br>
        In more than 40 years of National Football League competition, the Colts have achieved a
        325-352-7 record, including three World Championships and 10 Conference or Division
        titles. <br>
        <br>
        The success of the Colts franchise is exemplified by the number of Colts who have been
        inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. A total of eleven Colts have been selected
        for enshrinement including Raymond Berry, Art Donovan, Ted Hendricks, John Mackey, Gino
        Marchetti, Lenny Moore, Jim Parker, John Unitas and Head Coaches Weeb Ewbank and Don Shula
        from the Baltimore era and RB-Eric Dickerson from the Indianapolis era. <br>
