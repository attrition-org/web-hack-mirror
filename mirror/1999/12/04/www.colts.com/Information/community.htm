        <td width="100%"><font FACE="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The Indianapolis Colts take great
        pride in playing an active part in our community. We realize the importance and
        responsibility to give back to our community. Our commitment is to be active in programs
        that support and improve the quality of life of our fans and neighbors in and around
        Indiana. This is a commitment from the entire organization&#151;our players, coaches,
        front office staff. Our efforts combine financial support, in-kind donations and
        assistance with many community programs. <p>The following are just some of the ways the
        Colts are making positive &quot;hoofprints&quot; in the community:</p>
        <p><strong>FUNDRAISING EVENTS</strong></p>
        <p>The annual Colts Classic Golf Tournament is our largest fundraising event. Over 30
        players and coaches team up with corporate foursomes for a day on the links &quot;down
        under&quot; sponsored by Outback Steakhouse. The proceeds of the event benefit both
        Methodist Hospital and Noble of Indiana. Over $250,000 has been raised since the inaugural
        tournament.</p>
        <p><strong>PLAYER TICKET BLOCKS</strong></p>
        <p>Many of the Colts players and their families have donated time and resources to helping
        less fortunate young Colts fans attend games. In 1998, more than 20 players sponsored
        ticket blocks of at least 20 tickets per game to not-for-profit agencies. The players and
        organization realize the importance of providing a positive, unique and exciting
        experience for our Indiana youth&#151;our future fans. If you would like your organization
        to be considered for tickets through the program, please contact and/or send information
        about your group to the Colts Community Relations Department.</p>
        <p><strong>NEWSPAPER IN EDUCATION PROGRAM</strong></p>
        <p>The Colts have teamed up with The Star and The News since 1985 to provide educational
        programs to schools throughout central Indiana. Through the Gridiron Geography program,
        students in grades 3-8 follow the Colts through the sports pages of the newspaper to learn
        various school subjects&#151;primarily geography. 17 players participated in the program
        last year.</p>
        <p><strong>COMMUNITY OUTREACH</strong></p>
        <i><p><strong>Auction/Raffle Donations</strong></i></p>
        <p>Throughout the year, contributions of Colts&#146; memorabilia are given to Indiana
        charity organizations, community fundraisers, school functions and more. Items donated are
        typically used as auction items, raffle/door prizes as well as school incentive prizes.
        Please note that a written request for such items must be received at least six weeks in
        advance of the event for consideration.</p>
        <i><p><strong>Public Service Announcements and Campaigns</strong></i></p>
        <p>The visibility afforded to professional athletes gives our players an extraordinary
        opportunity to reach out and make an impact on the community. Public Service Announcements
        (PSA&#146;s) are one way we help accomplish this. Throughout each season, players and
        coaches help non-profit organizations promote their services by putting together
        PSA&#146;s for both radio and television.</p>
        <p><strong>COLTS APPEARANCES</strong></p>
        <p>Colts Cheerleaders are available for personal appearances. They frequently attend
        special community events, school assemblies, hospital visits, company events, golf
        outings, fundraising benefits and more. Please contact Pam Watkins at the Colts office for
        more information.</p>
        <p>When schedules permit, Colts players, coaches and management staff make public
        appearances for charity benefits, autograph sessions, speaking engagements and other
        various events. Front office representatives are also available to speak at career
        sessions and school programs.</p>
        <p>COLTS CAR-A-VAN<br>
        The Indianapolis Colts Car-a-van will stop at over 40 events and festivals all over the
        State of Indiana this summer. The Car-a-van is an interactive mobile unit which offers
        Colts fans the opportunity to meet Colts Cheerleaders, the chance to win Colts prizes as
        well as provide information about the upcoming season and events. If you would like your
        events or festival to be considered for a Car-a-van stop, please contact Kristi Dorman at
        the Colts office. </p>
        <p><strong>TOURS AND MEETINGS</strong></p>
        <p>The Colts Training Facility will be available this fall to groups and organizations for
        purposes of tours or a possible meeting site. Please contact the Community Relations
        Department for additional information.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Please note that any and all of these services provided by the Colts Community
        Relations Department are subject to availability and require at least six weeks advance
        written notice.</p>
        <p>We welcome and appreciate your support. For more information on any of the Colts
        Community programs, fans are encouraged to write or call: </font><font FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE="3"></p>
