          </span>The Colts and Dolphins are meeting for the 61<sup>st</sup>
          time, with Miami owning a 41-19 series advantage over the Colts, the
          most wins by any opponent in Colts history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>Miami took a heated 34-31 decision over Indianapolis on October
          10 in the RCA Dome to stretch its series winning streak to three
          games.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>The Colts dropped a 34-31 decision to Miami at home before a
          soldout crowd of 56,810 when QB-Dan Marino hit a 2t pass with
          WR-Oronde Gadsden with :27 remaining.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>The Colts opened the scoring with a 41-yard K-Mike Vanderjagt
          field goal 3:41 into the contest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>The club was poised to take a 10-0 lead on its second drive,
          but RB-Edgerrin James (22-81 rushing) fumbled on a first-down rush at
          the Miami one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>The Dolphins parlayed the miscue into a 37-yard K-Olindo Mare
          field goal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>Miami gained a 6-3 lead on its first drive of the second
          quarter as Mare connected on a 27-yard effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>His kick was set up by a defensive stand at the Indy 11.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>QB-Peyton Manning (17-24-274, 3 TDs/1 int.) countered with a
          33t strike to WR-Marvin Harrison (3-91, 1 TD) to cap an eight-play,
          76-yard drive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>Miami ended the half with a 21-yard Mare field goal as the
          Colts defense would not yield after a first-and-goal from its 3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>Manning staked the Colts to a 17-9 lead on the club’s first
          second-half possession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>He teamed with TE-Marcus Pollard (4-64, 2 TDs) on a 9t pitch
          6:26 into the period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>A wild fourth-quarter that saw 39 points scored started early
          as Marino (25-38-393, 2 TDs) hit WR-Tony Martin on a 28t pass 1:52
          into the quarter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>After a two-point pass failed, KOR-Terrence Wilkins raced 97
          yards with the ensuing kickoff for a 24-15 Colts lead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>RB-Cecil Collins (21-76, 1 TD) cut the count to 24-22 3:07
          later on a 25t burst.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>Manning offset the score just 1:31 later by hitting Pollard on
          a 32t pass to cap a four-play, 67-yard drive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>K-Olindo Mare got Miami within 31-25 with 3:20 to go with a
          43-yard field goal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>A holding call negated a Colts first down two plays later, and
          Indy chose to take a safety with 1:54 left as Manning ran out of the
          end zone from the team’s 13.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>Down 31-27, Miami gained advantage at its 36 with 1:50 left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>The key play came seconds later at 1:16 when a sack-fumble of
          Marino was overturned by instant replay at midfield.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>Marino found Gadsden for 48 yards to the Indy 2 on
          fourth-and-10, then hit Gadsden two plays later for the 34-31 win.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>Miami swept the seasonal series in 1998, taking a 24-15 win in
          Indianapolis on 9/6, then posting a 27-14 win at home on 11/15.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>The last Colts series win was 12/14/97, 41-0 in the RCA Dome.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>The Colts last won in Miami on October 8, 1995, when QB-Jim
          Harbaugh engineered a come-from-behind win as the Colts trailed, 24-3,
          in the third period before winning 27-24 in overtime.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>The Colts are 4-8 overall at Joe Robbie/Pro Player Stadium.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>The series has been contested more closely since 1992 than in
          past stretches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>Miami owns a 10-6 mark over those 16 games.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>Miami is 5-2 at home, while the Colts are 4-5 at home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>Each team has produced a shutout, along with notching a
          four-game series winning streak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
          </span>There has been one overtime game, seven games decided by six
          points or less and the point differential over the last 15 games is
          but 40 points (Miami leads, 361-321).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;

          (992-600-7224, 51 TDs/16 ints.) is career leader vs. Colts in comp-att-yds-TDs...6
          300+ games are the most vs. Colts...48 att. at Miami 9/15/85 rank as
          4th-most vs. Colts in one game...30 comp. 11/6/94 was only the 3rd 30+
          individual comp. game ever allowed by Colts...7 career 70+ comp. pct.
          games are twice as many as any other QBs who ever met Colts...Marino
          has started 32 of 33 possible career games vs. Colts 1983-99 (missing
          only 10/24/93 with achilles injury)...his 22 career victories against
          the Colts are the most by him against any team and are the most
          against the Colts by any opposing QB... Colts-Dolphins have met 59
          times in regular season history (most by Colts vs. any opponent) and
          once in AFC title game...Miami rushed for 137 yards and had gross
          passing total of 135 yards in 9/6/98 opening win at Indy, only the 4th
          time in 33 series games under Marino that Miami had more rushing yards
          than passing yards...in 11 of 26 regular season Colts-Miami meetings
          prior to Marino’s arrival, the Dolphins had more yards via the rush
          than with the pass...the Dolphins were 9-2 in those 11 pre-Marino
          games and are 4-0 in games with Marino where they rushed for more
          yards than they passed.<o:p>
