<p align="center">        unfinished symphony<br>
<br>
        Look outside, the gods are crying,<br>
        screaming out their agony,<br>
        look outside, they're all lying,<br>
        searing with their apathies,<br>
        look outside, see the world,<br>
        writhing in its pain,<br>
        look outside, see the earth,<br>
        starting over again,<br>
        Look out there, the sky shows its sorrow,<br>
        Look outside, think it'll heal by tomorrow?<br>
        can you see the scars?<br>
        they're hardly reflective.<br>
        Open mouths, silent cries,<br>
        anyone can tell,<br>
        the look of haunted eyes,<br>
        rivers of tears flowing down,<br>
        the slivers of fear,<br>
        you wear like a crown,<br>
        I can feel you here,<br>
        haunting what once was me.<br>
