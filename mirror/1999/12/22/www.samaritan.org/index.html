    Merry christmas to you while you all enjoy your big fat turkey dinners. I hope you choke
    on them! Hmm.. My bed needs more stuffing. Not quite enough hundred dollar bills in the
    mattress. <br>
    <br>
    I know! I'll show you graphic images of people starving in foreign countries. I'll make
    you feel guilty while you celebrate christmas, and then convince you to donate money to
    me! <br>
    <br>
    Then I'll have plenty more cash to stuff my mattress with, and I'll be able to pay the
    next month's hosting for this site. Plus a few first class tickets for me to fly over to
    these places and pretend I'm doing something. All the while, you suckers will never ask
    what's being done with your money. <br>
    <br>
    Hmm, now the tough part. How to make it work... Ah ha! We simply use the word
    &quot;christ&quot; a lot. If people will believe that, they'll believe anything. I'll have
    them transferring the deeds to their houses over to me in no time! For fear that if they
    dont, god will hate them and not protect them from the giant Why-Two-Kay insects that will
    storm the earth devouring every one and every thing in their path! <br>
    <br>
    Yes I definitely am the master of deception. <br>

Now is the time for all good hackers to sleep, and for the demons to walk the Earth,
