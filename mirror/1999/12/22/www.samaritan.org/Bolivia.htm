        <p><font color="#000000">SANTA CRUZ, Bolivia&#151;South
        America once again has shown a warm heart for the Gospel.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Franklin Graham preached the
        Gospel to more than 138,000 people November 10-13 in
        Santa Cruz&#146;s Ramón Tahuichi Aguilera Stadium. More
        than 19,200 people came forward to make public decisions
        for Christ.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both numbers were the largest
        ever for one of Graham&#146;s crusades. Last year in
        neighboring Peru, 132,000 attended a crusade and 17,152
        made decisions.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Bolivia Para Cristo&quot;
        was Graham&#146;s final evangelistic festival of 1999.
        The next one will be Feb. 11-12, 2000, in Managua,
        Nicaragua.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Graham also led crusades this
        year in Canada, Scotland, Jamaica, and the United States.
        During the year, he preached before more than a
        half-million people, and almost 46,000 made public
        decisions for Christ.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The response was encouraging in
        Santa Cruz, which is home to 1.3 million of
        Bolivia&#146;s 8 million people. Each night, after Graham
        presented God&#146;s plan for forgiveness and salvation,
        people responding to the invitation ran from their seats
        across the soccer field to the foot of the stage.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he watched people being
        counseled the first night of the festival, José Luís
        Suárez wept. &quot;This is precious,&quot; said Suárez,
        the executive chair of Bolivia Para Cristo. &quot;It
        encourages us to continue working. We can see what God
        has done. When I saw the people coming down and running,
        that was the most emotional part for me.&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the four-night
        festival, there was a special Saturday-morning session
        for children. There were 4,233 decisions among the 32,500
        who watched a presentation of a children&#146;s Gospel
        musical called &quot;The Puzzle.&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The outreach to children also
        included the distribution of hundreds of gift-filled shoe
        boxes at a children&#146;s hospital and in a poor
        neighborhood.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Musical guests included Jaci
        Velasquez, who has the No. 1 song on the Latin music
        charts and was performing for the first time in Bolivia.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Santa Cruz festival
        committee organized 400 churches and trained 6,000
        counselors.</font></p>
