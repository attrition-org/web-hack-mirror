                    <p><font face="Arial">William Franklin
                    Graham, III, born July 14, 1952, is the
                    fourth of five children born to evangelist
                    Billy Graham and his wife, Ruth Bell Graham.
                    Raised in a log home in the Appalachian
                    Mountains outside Asheville, North Carolina,
                    Franklin now lives in Boone, North Carolina.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial">At age 22, after a
                    period of rebellion and traveling the world,
                    Franklin committed his life to Jesus Christ
                    while alone in a hotel room in Jerusalem.
                    Soon after that, Dr. Bob Pierce, founder of
                    Samaritan&#146;s Purse (and World Vision, the
                    world's largest Christian relief and
                    development organization), invited Franklin
                    to join him on a six-week mission to Asia. It
                    was during that time that Franklin felt a
                    calling to work with hurting people in areas
                    of the world affected by war, famine,
                    disease, and natural disasters.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial">Franklin was elected to
                    the Board of Samaritan&#146;s Purse in 1978,
                    and one year later, following the death of
                    Bob Pierce, he was elected president of the
                    organization, a position he has held ever
                    since. Today, with an annual budget of more
                    than $85 million, Samaritan&#146;s Purse
                    supports evangelical efforts and relief
                    assistance throughout Africa, Asia, Eastern
                    Europe, the Middle East, and North and South
                    America. The organization is headquartered in
                    Boone, North Carolina, with offices in
                    Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and
                    the Netherlands. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial">In 1989, Franklin
                    conducted his first evangelistic crusade and
                    committed to spend 10 percent of his time
                    each year preaching. Each year he conducts up
                    to 10 <a href="festival.htm">festivals</a>
                    around the world as an evangelist for the
                    Billy Graham Evangelistic Association
                    (BGEA).&nbsp; Since 1989, he has preached to
                    more than 1.6 million people in cities from
                    Johannesburg, South Africa, to Tupelo,
                    Mississippi. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial">In 1995, Franklin was
                    elected to serve as the first vice-chairman
                    of the BGEA&#151;a position with direct
                    succession to become chairman and CEO of the
                    organization. Franklin has served on the BGEA
                    Board since 1979.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial">Franklin is the author
