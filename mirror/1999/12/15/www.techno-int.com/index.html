<p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;Attrition.org has changed my life - not in the way you<br>
might think - you see, attrition.org is my grandchild in a<br>
bizarre sort of way. Attrition.org was conceived by my son<br>
and just as for any mother the journey into the role of<br>
grandmother is quite unique. This grandchild, attrition.org.,<br>
has opened many doors for me. This child shows me things I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt;
this is incredible!!!!!so deep<br>
have never seen. Sometimes it scares me with where it goes in<br>
the world of cyberspace. Sometimes it brings me to tears with<br>
laughter. It never ceases to amaze me. Like any one year old<br>
I believe it is still finding its way. Attrition.org is the<br>
image of its father. It is a brilliant star, a myriad of emotions,<br>
a wealth of knowledge, a whirlwind of activity. I hope I am<br>
around for many years to come to enjoy attrition.org., this one<br>
of a kind offspring who has come so far in just 365 days.<br>
Happy Birthday!!!&quot; - Jericho's Mother</font></p>
