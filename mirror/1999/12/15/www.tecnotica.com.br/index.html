<p align="center">TELETUBBIES.<br>
We watch the TV and think it's fake,<br>
a world of splendor,<br>
full of wealth,<br>
and all people are in good health,<br>
A utopia for all to be seen<br>
through a transparent screen.<br>
we think we are real.<br>
Someone's watching us though.<br>
We think we rule the world.<br>
But like we kill fly's,<br>
they can kill us with a blink of their eyes.<br>
We have no respect for we don't seem them.<br>
some call em gods,<br>
depicted with electric rods.<br>
Some call them &quot;rulers&quot;,<br>
guides.<br>
But we are just entertainment,<br>
for the powers above<br>
we are adorable and create a feeling of love.<br>
Long live the teletubbies,<br>
because we're the humantubbies.<br>
And as soon as they came extinct,<br>
we will too.<br>
			Firefly</p>
