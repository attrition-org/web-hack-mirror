<br><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=-1>
<br><BR>

	Put your <STRONG>CGI</STRONG> programs in the cgi-bin directory.<br>

<ul>
<li>The cgi-bin will automatically chage the permissions to chmod 755 for you<br>
<li>Its important because of the apache wrapper being run that scripts and there directories be chmod 755, chmod 777 will not work<br>

<br>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">
<STRONG><U>CGIemail:</U></STRONG>This is a program that will email you the forms filled out from the web.<br>
<br>
Here's an example -<br>
<br>
Create a text file called "example" in the main web directory.<br>
This is the content of the file:<br>
<PRE><br>
	To: joe@blue.com
	Subject: example
<br>
	This is a test message.
	This is a test message.
	name: [name]
	phone: [phone]</PRE>
<br>
<br>
That is the file that will be sent to joe@blue.com.<br>
Now, <STRONG>cgiemail</STRONG> will automatically replace [name], [phone], anything<br>
in the brackets with the corresponding user supplied info from the web<br>
form.  Also, you MUST have the To: and the Subject: line followed by<br>
the blank line.  Those three lines MUST be on the FIRST THREE lines.  You<br>
cannot change the From: address.<br>
<br>
Here is a part of the web form page called "example.html"<br>
<br><xmp>
<form method="post" action="/cgi-bin/cgiemail/example">
<input type=text name="name">Your name?
<input type=text name="phone">your number?
etc...
</xmp><br>
<br>
If you want to have your own customized "success" page, place the following<br>
line in your form page:<br>
<br><xmp>
<INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="success" VALUE="http://yourdomain/somepage.html">
</xmp><br>
It will then redirect to somepage.html.<br>
<br><p>
<STRONG><U>Formmail</u></strong> is a very easy to use form processor,
simply place the following on any page after entering your domain.<br>
<p><b>
&lt;FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/formmail.cgi"><br>
&lt;input type=hidden name="recipient" value="sales@yourdomain.com"><br>

<A NAME="5"> <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"  SIZE=+1>How do I use the anonymous ftp site?</FONT></A><br>
<br><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Your anonymous ftp site is completely different from your web site.<br>
<br>
When people ftp to your domain anonymously, they will see the following<br>
directories:<br>
<br>
bin/       dev/       etc/       incoming/  lib/       pub/<br>
<br>
"pub" is where you should put all your anonymously accessible files.<br>
"incoming" is for the anonymous users to upload files.
<p>
For security the following applies<br>
<ul>
<li>Only the incoming directory can be written to anonymously<br>
<li>Subdirectories are not creatable<br>
<li>The incoming directory is not readable by people dropping files there<br>
</ul>
<li>

 You are responsible<br>
for any "pirated" software uploaded by the anonymous users.  The anonymous<br>
ftp sites will be periodically monitored for any abuses.<br>
<br>
You may ignore the other directories.</font>

<br>
<A NAME="6"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"  SIZE=+1>How do I create email aliases, and how do I redirect them?</FONT></A><br>
<br><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">
Assume your domain is "example.com".<br>
<br>
You need to edit the .redirect file in your home directory.<br>
<br>
Here is a sample .redirect file for example.com:<br>
<br>
<PRE><br>
	default example@example.com
	webmaster example@example.com
	sales joe@aol.com,mike@whatever.com
	info robert@example.com</PRE>
<br>
That will automatically redirect all webmaster@example.com emails to<br>
example@example.com, sales@example.com to joe@aol.com AND <br>
mike@whatever.com, and <br>
info@example.com to robert@example.com.  All others will go to <br>
example@example.com.  Note that webmaster line isn't necessary, but <br>
it's better to specifically redirect it to example@example.com.<br>
<br>
It's important to note that the second column must be REAL accounts.  
You cannot redirect emails to an alias.
<br>
Please note that it takes a few minutes for the .redirect file to go into<br>
effect after you've updated it.<br>
<br>
Ask us to create additional real email(POP) accounts. </FONT>

<br>
<A NAME="7"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"  SIZE=+1>How do I use the infobots?</FONT></A><br>
<br><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">
Very simple.  Just create a text file and put it in the infobots directory.<br>
Let's say that the name of the text file is "info".  Now, when you send<br>
mail to info@example.com, you will get the text file mailed back to you.<br>
That's it.  Try it out.  There is no limit to the number of these<br>
infobots.  Note that the name of the file is simply "info", and not <br>
"info.txt". </FONT>

<br>
<A NAME="8"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"  SIZE=+1> How do I see who is using my infobots?</FONT></A> <br>
<br><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">
Assume your infobot address is info@example.com.<br>
Just put the following line in your .redirect file.<br>
Its important that you have the infobot installed <br>
before entering the address line in the .redirect<br>

<br>
<PRE>	info example@example.com<br></PRE>
<br>
The original email message will be sent to example@example.com, and the<br>
original sender will get the infobot text. </FONT>

<A NAME="9"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"  SIZE=+1>How do I create a majordomo mailing list?</FONT></A><br>
<br><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">
Ask us. Tell us the name of the mailing list and the password for it.<p>
For full instructions email our autoresponder at <a href="mailto:domo@safe-order.net">domo@safe-order.net</a><br>
There may be extra charges if your mailing list is very <br>

<A NAME="10"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"  SIZE=+1>How do I use Real Audio?</FONT></A><br>
<br><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">
Real Audio is available for a small extra charge (email sales for more info) <br></FONT>
<p>
    RealAudio is a real time audio transmission/player system. A digital
    audio stream is transmitted from the server over the internet to the
    destination and played immediately, rather than being stored to disk
    first and then played.
<p>
    Each audio clip requires two files: a metafile with extension .ram, and
    the digital audio clip itself, with extension .ra. The .ram file holds one
    or more lines of ASCII text, each of which references the .ra file to
    be played when the .ram file is accessed by the browser.
<p>
    Entries in .ram files have the form:
<p>
    rtsp://styx.host4u.net/your-domain/name-of-clip.ra
<p>
  Place your .ram and .ra files in the realaudio subdirectory under
    your web directory. 
<p>
    .ram files must be uploaded in ASCII mode while .ra files must be
    uploaded in BINARY mode.
<p>
    You may then access these files at realaudio/file.ram under your
    www directory.

How do I use the SSL server for my order form?
</FONT></A><br>
<br><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">

<p>
Normally, any text(such as your credit card number) sent from your
browser to the web server is sent as plain text.  This means that a
hacker could potentially intercept(however unlikely) the information
sent from your browser and read it.  <br>
However, by using the secure server, the information is encrypted
before it is sent from your browser.  It would be practically impossible
for anyone to decrypt it without knowing the key.
<br> 
Please use the secure server only when necessary.
<p>
Assume your domain is example.com.<br>
<p>
Use the following url to access your pages via the secure server.

<font size=3>
<pre>https://styx.safe-order.net/example/anypage.html </pre>
<br></font>

The above page would be accessed from the normal web server as:

<font size=3>
<pre>http://example.com/anypage.html </pre>
<br></font>


Your cgi-bin dir is:

<font size=3>
<pre>https://styx.safe-order.net/cgi-example/ </pre>
<br></font>

*SPECIAL NOTE FOR FORMMAIL.CGI* <p>

If you are using formmail.cgi thru the secure server, you MUST use the
following url:

<font size=3>
<pre>https://styx.safe-order.net/cgi-bin/formmail.cgi

Here's an example:

&lt;FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="https://styx.safe-order.net/cgi-bin/formmail.cgi">
&lt;input type=hidden name="recipient" value="sales@yourdomain.com">
&lt;input type=hidden name="subject" value="Order">
&lt;input type=hidden name="return_link_url" value="http://yourdomain.com/">
&lt;input type=hidden name="return_link_title" value="Back to Main Page">
</pre>
<p></font>


The last two line allow a link back to your main page - thus they get a
report of what they ordered and a link. We made the modification for you
already <p>

<b>Its important that you call your order page thru a secure URL in order to work properly<br>

<h3><a name="18"></a>SOLUTIONS TO COMMON PROBLEMS</h3>
<p>
<h4><a name="32"></a>Access logs</h4>
<p>
<i>"I can't find my access log!"</i><p>
They are in your home directory, this is the directory you are in when you first logon.<br>
<p>
<h4><a name="Error_Logs"></a>2.1.2) Error logs</h4>
<i>"I can't find my error log?"</i><p>

   We don't keep error logs for performance reasons. 
<h4><a name="33"></a>Cgi-bin scripts</h4>
<p>
<i>"Where do I put my cgi-bin scripts?"</i><p>

Put them in the subdirectory cgi-bin which should be under your
www directory.<p>

<p>
<h4><a name="34"></a>Perl scripts</h4>
<p>
<i>"I am being told file not found"</i><p>
<i>"I am being told No such file or directory"</i><p>

    Upload your Perl script in ascii mode, not binary mode.
<p>
   Sometimes it seems like this is asked about once a day, so
we're going to repeat it, loudly.<p>
<note class=warning>
<strong>
Upload your Perl script in ascii mode, not binary mode.
</strong>
</note><p>
<p>
<i>"I get errors such as
<pre>
Literal @sdfsdf now requires backslash at ./test.rob line 2, within string
Execution of ./test.rob aborted due to compilation errors."
</pre></i><p>

    Place a "\" before such offending @ characters.  This is an
    incompatibility between Perl 5 and Perl 4.
<p>
<p>
<h5><a name="36"></a>Anonymous ftp</h5>
<p>
<i>"Where should I store files for anonymous ftp access?"</i><p>

     Put files in the directory named anonftp/pub.
     This will allow a file to be accessed by a customer with
     ftp://yourdomain.com/pub/your-file-name.
<p>
For security the following applies<br>
<ul>
<li>Only the incoming directory can be written to anonymously<br>
<li>Subdirectories are not creatable<br>
<li>The incoming directory is not readable by people dropping files there<br>
</ul>
<li>

<p>
<p>
<h5><a name="37"></a>Setting permissions</h5>
<p>
<i>"Hey, how do I stop people who are not in my group from reading
a directory?"</i><p>

    Type <tt>chmod o-r directory</tt> while you are in the directory above
    it.
<p>
<i>"I don't care if people in my group can read my directory, but
I don't want them to write in it!"</i><p>

    Type <tt>chmod g-w directory</tt> while you are in the directory above
    it.
<p>
<i>"Who is in my group?"</i><p>
    In general, each domain has its own group.  If you find you are
    in the group users, let us know if you wish for your domain to
    have its own group.
<p>
<i>"Tell me more about permissions, they sound neat!"</i><p>

    To list the access permissions of a file or directory, type
<i>ls -ls *</i>.
    r=read access, x=execute access, w=write access.  The first three
    letters apply to you, the second three letters apply to your group,
    the last three letters apply to everyone else.  Execute access enables
    you to run programs or enter directories.
<p>
    Examples of using chmod:
<pre>
    PEOPLE                                    PERMISSIONS
    u = the file's user (or owner)            r = read access
    g = the file's group                      x = execute access
    o = others                                w = write access
    a = the user, the group, and others.

    chmod a+w =  let everyone write to the file
    chmod go-r = don't let people in the file's group or others to read
                 the file
    chmod g+x =  let people in the file's group execute the file
</pre><p>
<p>
<p>
<h5><a name="39"></a>Don't have permission to access /</h5>
    This error message means that you are missing your index.html
    file.
<p>
    Note that files that start with a "." are hidden files.  To see
    them, type ls -al at shell prompt.
<p>
    If you wish to ftp this file in, go to the /home/fred directory
    assuming your userid is fred.
<p>
<h5><a name="310"></a>I get a forbidden when trying to access my site</h5>
    This error is generally because you have not placed a default page in the main directory.<br>
    A default page must be called index.htm, or default.htm and it should be your main page<br>
