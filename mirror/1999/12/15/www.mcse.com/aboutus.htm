    Leader in Adult Higher Education</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left" style="margin-left:"><font face="Arial" size="2">With over 61,000
    currently enrolled students, the University of Phoenix is America's largest private
    accredited university for working adults. We have provided Degree Programs and Certificate
    Programs to more than 447,000 working professionals in the United States, the Commonwealth
    of Puerto Rico and dozens of foreign countries.<br>
    <br>
    Accredited in 1978, the University of Phoenix was among the first to<br>
    recognize the need for degree and continuing education programs for<br>
    adult professionals. In nearly two decades of developing and implementing targeted
    Academic Programs, we have achieved an<br>
    enviable ability to understand and meet the specialized demands of the working student.
    Today, we offer a multitude of programs at learning center locations in thirteen states,
    the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Vancouver British Columbia and via Distance Education.<br>
    <br>
    The cornerstone of our educational philosophy is the recognition of the distinction
    between the younger student still deciding on a career and the adult student who has
    established personal and professional goals. We know that education for working adults
    must harmonize with full personal and professional lives. And we have developed programs
    that allow mature students to benefit from the integration of work and school. Our Faculty
    is comprised of working practitioners, experts in their field.</font></p>
