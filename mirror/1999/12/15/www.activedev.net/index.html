So NASA just spent $165 million on a toy which they just lost...
Pathetic.  They send their latest tech toy to Mars in
search of an ocean that may have been there millions of years ago...
Yet, here on Earth we have poor kids who can't get clean
water.  They are hungry, homeless, and in dire need of 
many things which we take for luxury.  Yet here is the 
biggest political country in the friggin' world spending
$165 million on a long distance remote controlled car
in search of water that may have existed millions of years
ago...  Hey, it's not just them.  We have to give too.
