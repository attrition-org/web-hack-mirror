                Grainger was delivering the 1999 Spry Memorial
                Lecture in Vancouver, Canada. Graham Spry was a
                champion of public broadcasting in Canada and the
                Graham Spry Fund for Public Broadcasting was
                created in 1996 in recognition of his work. The
                purpose of the endowment which created the fund
                is to sponsor an annual public lecture and
                related academic activities relevant to the
                promotion of public broadcasting in Canada. Mr
                Grainger will also deliver his address in French
                in Montreal on 2 November.</font></p>

                and now the Internet make use of public property,
                the airwaves and bandwidth. Broadcasting remains,
                and the Internet is clearly emerging as, a means
                of mass communication of a particularly intrusive
                nature. They enter our homes and workplaces,
                exercise important influences on public life and
                national cultures. Their content has been and
                remains, the latest research confirms in relation
                to the Internet, a matter of considerable concern
                to the public who wish to see national cultures
                preserved and enriched and to see young people
                protected from inappropriate material,&quot; Mr
                Grainger said.</font></p>

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">&quot;It
                is essential for policy makers and legislators,
                as they review existing and prepare new rules for
                broadcasting and the Internet, to revisit and
                restate the public interest objectives they
                believe should apply to those industries and
                their governance. Sweeping references to
                &#145;the public interest&#146; may be less
                effective than a clear articulation of the
                process concerns that legislators are seeking to
                advance.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">&quot;National
                parliaments in democratic systems such as those
                of Australia, the UK, and Canada provide the one
                legitimate constitutional outlet for public
                concerns and it is entirely appropriate that,
                even in an age of increasing internationalisation
                of broadcasting and now the Internet, it be
                national parliaments which set the rules for the
                regulation of these matters within national
                borders. However, it is equally clear that
                activities such as the Internet which are heavily
                transborder in scope must be governed by rules
                which reflect major developments taking place
                elsewhere in the world. International discussions
                are needed, and are occurring right now, to allow
                governments, industries, users and communities to
                help shape suitable rules for new media such as
                the Internet.&quot;</font></p>

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">&quot;Co-regulatory
                or self-regulatory schemes for dealing with these
                issues seem to require the existence of an umpire
                to oversee the efficient and effective working of
                these schemes and to deal with public complaints.
                It is appropriate for such umpires to be given
                discretion to interpret the public interest
                objectives of such schemes to decide their
                application to particular circumstances. Such
                bodies will be assisted by the clear articulation
                of the legislature&#146;s public interest
                objectives to guide the regulator in its efforts
                to allow the public good in specific cases.&quot;</font></p>

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">&quot;In
                relation both to broadcasting, a highly mature
                industry, and the Internet whose usage is so
                diffuse, it is apparent that the most appropriate
                means for dealing with governance issues is
                through the healthy consultative interaction of
                governments, regulators, industry and the
                community in schemes of self-regulation or
                co-regulation. While legislators may well see
                industry self-regulation as the sensible
                direction for communication industry governance
                to take, it is difficult to see how such schemes
                will be genuinely effective without some
                provision for industry umpires and for the safety
                valve of public complaints processes. </font></p>

                in the United States the US Constitution First
                Amendment allows the free speech lobby to
                dominate discussion about self-regulation, other
                countries with healthy democratic systems and
                vibrant processes of open expression are able to
                seek a more appropriate balance between the right
                to free expression and the right of communities
                to nurture national and local cultures and to
                protect children from harmful content. There is
                no one right way for any nation to approach the
                manner in which we move forward in these issues. </font></p>

                Australia we are now endeavouring to place online
                services on the same footing as broadcasting and
                are applying a co-regulatory framework governed
                by important public interest considerations. I
                believe this has much to commend it. Other
                nations will make their own decisions on what
                best meets community and industry needs for this
                activity. However, I am absolutely convinced that
                at the end of the twentieth century it is time
                for all of us who care about these issues to
                reaffirm our faith in the overriding importance
                of the public interest to ensure that healthy
                vibrant communications industries are conducted
                for the public good.&quot;</font></p>
