                matters of significant public interest,&quot;
                said Mr Michael Gordon Smith, Presiding Member at
                the 2UE hearing. &quot;We have gone to
                considerable lengths to ensure procedural
                fairness to all parties involved. As part of that
                process, draft material was provided to the
                parties to the hearing for comment in advance of
                closing submissions next week. It is regrettable
                that extracts of this draft material were
                provided to the Sydney Morning Herald. It is also
                regrettable that the Sydney Morning Herald chose
                to publish those extracts.&quot;</font></p>

                such material be published prior to it being
                formally presented in public on 2 December 1999
                where it can be considered in the context of
                closing addresses from other parties. It is
                unsatisfactory that particular excerpts from a
                draft be published one, where you may not have a
                perfect record of what was read to you and
                secondly, where the draft may change before it is
                finally presented. I can already advise that some
                changes have been made to the draft and no doubt
                further changes will be made before it is finally
                presented.</font></p>
