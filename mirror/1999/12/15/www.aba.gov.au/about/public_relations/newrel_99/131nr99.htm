                ABA believes it is undesirable for any
                free-to-air television broadcaster to be able to
                choose a means of transmission that requires a
                large investment by views and that does not allow
                viewers to access other services licensed to
                serve their area.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">This
                is the ABA's conclusionfollowing the completion
                of its investigation into whether the legitimate
                needs of viewser were addressed during the
                transition of the Golden West Network television
                service WAW Remote Western Australia from an
                anlog to a digital satellite delivered signal
                last year.</font></p>

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">&quot;While
                this kind of strategy may be legitimate in the
                case of pay TV, it should not be part of the
                free-to-air system. Free-to-air broadcasters have
                unique obligations to the community and as a
                result enjpy special dispensation, including a
                degree of protection from competition,&quot; said
                Professor David Flint, ABA Chairman.</font></p>

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">There
                are various ways in which assess to the fill
                suite of services could be achieved, depending on
                the circumstances. These include: (i) that all
                free-to-air broadcasters could use the one
                satellite; or (ii) that each satellite could
                carry the full range of free-to-air services for
                that area; or (iii) that all service providers
                could ensure, in some other way, that reception
                equipment is able to receive all services.</font></p>

                present there is no person or federal government
                agency with the power to ensure this outcome.
                This is because there is no single regulatory
                body to regulate all the broadcasters, satellite
                service providers and intermediaries involved,
                including the commercial and national
                broadcasters, telecommunications carriers and

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">The
                ABA believes that it is in the long term public
                interest of viewers that such power should reside
                in a single regulatory body and will be referring
                this matter to the Minister for Communications,
                Information Technology and the Arts pursuant to
                its function to report on the operation of the
                Act.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">In
                the ABA's view, there are three major factors
                which influenced whter or not GWN viewers in
                regional and remote Western Australia made the
                transition from the analog signal delivered by
                the Optus satellite to the digital signal
                delivered by the Telstra satellite during the
                period when the services were simulcast.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">The
                first was the length of time set a side for
                simulcasting and the specific timing of that
                simulcasting. The second was the belief among
                many viewers that Optus would continue to provide
                the WAW service in analog until Optus also
                converted to digital. The third and most
                important reason is that most direct-to-home
                viewers and self-help viewers wanted to be able
                to receive all available broadcasting services
                with the purchase of one decoder.</font></p>
