                the tests for control in the Act is &#145;control

                a position to exercise control of Canberra FM
                Radio Pty Limited and Newcastle Radio Pty Limited
                through the provision of news services. In
                accordance with section 180 of the Act, the ABA
                distributed copies of its draft investigation

                of Prime and the other parties to the original

                preliminary conclusions. The representatives
                advised the ABA that (in any event) the terms in
                the original agreements that had given rise to
                the ABA&#146;s concerns were readily capable of
                amendment. As a result, the ABA and Prime entered
                into discussions as to how Prime and the other
                parties could amend the original agreements to
                remove those terms of concern to the ABA.</font></p>

                the <em>Broadcasting Services Act 1992</em> (the

                Prime, Austereo Pty Limited and Australian Radio
                Network Ltd relating to these arrangements (to
                determine whether these agreements could put
                Prime in breach of the Act). As a result of its
                preliminary inquiries, on 9 April 1998 the ABA
                commenced an investigation into the control

                the commercial radio broadcasters Radio Newcastle
                and Canberra FM. The investigation focussed on
                whether such agreements placed Prime in breach of
                any provision of Part 5 of the Act (in
                particular, paragraphs 60(a) and 61(1)(a) of the

                the source of the news. Prime submitted that this
