                breaches, 75 related to codes of practice (59 in
                1997-98), 55 were breaches of licence conditions

                conditions and of the Act is of concern to the
                Authority. It partly reflects a continued

                of the increase in the number of breaches can be
                attributed to three issues: the scheduling of
                non-program matter on commercial television, the
                broadcasting of political matter without the
                authorisation details and compliance with the
                Children&#146;s Television Standards. </font></p>

                commercial television, issues relating to the
                scheduling of non-program matter resulted in 34
                breaches of the code. The findings were mainly
                the result of differences in the way licensees
                and the Authority interpreted the provisions of
                the Commercial Television Industry Code of
                Practice. The Federation of Australian Commercial
                Television Stations (FACTS) undertook to amend
                this code by clarifying the provisions. The
                Authority registered the revised Commercial
                Television Industry Code of Practice on 8 April
                1999. </font></p>

                investigation, into the broadcasting of political
                matter on six Queensland commercial television
                services resulted in the Authority finding 28
                breaches of the licence condition that requires
                political matter to be immediately followed by an
                announcement of the required particulars
                (commonly called the authorisation details or
                tag). The Authority took no action with regard to
                the breaches, taking into account the fact that
                the Authority&#146;s Guidelines for the
                Broadcasting of Political Matter were not
                published at the time of the broadcasts and that
                it was difficult for licensees to apply the
                requirements of the licence condition with any
                certainty prior to their publication. However,
                all licensees have been put on notice that future
                breaches of this licence condition are likely to
                be regarded more seriously by the Authority, and
                treated accordingly.</font></p>

                Television Standards. While the breaches were
                mainly administrative in nature, the Authority
                will closely monitor licensees&#146; compliance

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">The
                six breaches of the Act all related to the
                provision of a commercial radio service without a
                licence to do so. In each case, the offender held
                an apparatus licence for the provision of an open
                narrowcasting service. The Authority issued a
                notice under section 137 of the Act to each
                service provider directing the service provider
                to cease providing a commercial radio service.
                Two service providers ceased providing their
                service upon receipt of the notice from the
                Authority. The Authority is yet to determine
                whether the other three service providers (two
                breaches concerned the one service provider) have
                complied with the Authority&#146;s notices.</font></p>

                and the ABA is laid down in the Broadcasting
                Services Act 1992. The Act requires that
                complaints from viewers and listeners about
                program content matters that are covered by a
                code of practice be directed in the first

                the ABA receives a complaint that there has been
                a breach of the Act or of a licence condition, it

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">Complaints
                about breaches of codes of practice are first
                dealt with by the broadcaster. It is the
                broadcaster&#146;s responsibility to deal with
                the complaint and to resolve it to the
                satisfaction of the complainant.</font></p>

                the response to be inadequate, the complainant
                has the right to take the matter to the ABA for
                investigation. The ABA is obliged to investigate
                these unresolved complaints.</font></p>

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">A
                breach of a code of practice is not a breach of a
                licence condition or of the Act. The ABA may make
                compliance with a code a condition of a
                broadcaster&#146;s licence, but the code is
                intended to be an integral part of a
                self-regulatory process. The ABA&#146;s response
                to a breach of a code is to work with the
                broadcaster to ensure that the broadcaster
                concerned rectifies problems with its performance
                against the code. The ABA has the power to make
                compliance with a code a licence condition where
                there are repeated breaches of the code or a
                broadcaster proves unwilling to take remedial
                action.</font></p>

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">Because
                the regulatory onus is on the broadcasters
                themselves, when dealing with breaches of codes,
                the ABA has worked with the broadcasters
                concerned, or with industry representative
                bodies, to ensure problems identified are
                rectified, that steps are taken to ensure such a
                breach does not recur, and, if necessary,
                appropriate amendments are made to codes.</font></p>

                and the Act, although the ABA has the discretion
                to take punitive action against licensees,
                Parliament has made clear in s.5 of the Act that
                such action must be commensurate with the
                seriousness of the breach. In all cases of a
                breach of condition in the 1998-99 year, the ABA
                was of the view that the finding of a breach and
                the response of the licensee in remedying the
                breach was commensurate with the seriousness of
                the breach.</font></p>

                material broadcast on the ABC or SBS that is

                Broadcasters (FARB) provide the ABA with
