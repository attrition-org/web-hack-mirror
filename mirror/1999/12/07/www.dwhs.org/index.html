    people to learn and be aware of security...nothing else..Security is very important fact.
    During this hack I didnt destroy any data and I fix your security problem (if possible). I
    leave you your original page (original.htm) and take main page for my messages, so dont
    get mad at me, just think about your security next time.....</font></td>

face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">: yet another box with weak security
and bad administration. Ok i know that some unknown servers cant have good security. This
is obviously, but when I saw this :))) i need exactly 53.sec. to break in to this box :P
...isn't that ironic or what?</font></p>

<p><font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">some words
here: </font><font color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Do
you phear? I mean laical. Cause when you look on &quot;scene&quot; some new good doodz
come to help and old groups is back. To finish what they start. FBI cant stop them....why?
Cause this is a war of knowledge and wisedom. War that they (FBI and other phear
organisations) cannot win and nobody can help them.......only the same as we are and who
wont do this?.... gonna tell you: <b>NO ONE</b></font></p>
