<FONT SIZE=4>ACTIVEDEV.NET HAS BEEN HACKED BY ME, PYROSTORM666, UNDER 
SUSPICION OF PINGING MY SERVER, AND THEREFORE POSING A SECURITY RISK
TO ME AND MY SERVER.  (THIS IS NOT TRUE, BUT I'M TRYING TO PROVE A POINT.)
</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=RED SIZE=4>
AUSTRALIA - A new law has been passed allowing the government to hack
provate computers so long as they have probably cause to do so.  Why the
hell can't I hack a government computer claiming I had reason to believ
they were withholding the truth from me about UFO's?
<br>You get my point.
</font><br>
Activedev.net - A small private business, one that could be hacked legally
if it were situated in Australia under reason of "security risk" and "probable
cause".  Excuse my sarcasm.
