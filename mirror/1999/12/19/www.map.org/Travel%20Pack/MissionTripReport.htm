        <p><font size="3">Dear Sharon and Lisa,</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our couriers
        just returned from Honduras with the enclosed pictures.
        As you can see all of the MAP Travel Packs and special
        order medications made it in good shape and were received
        by Dr. Reniery Espana, Medical Director, Department of
        Medical Services of AIEH - The Association of
        Institutions of the Evangelical and Reformed Church of
        Honduras. These medications are being distributed without
        charge by Dr. Espana and his associates and assistants,
        aided by volunteers from the First Congregational Church
        of Greenwich.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During their
        visit our couriers took MAP medications with Dr. Espana
        up into the mountains&nbsp; of Northwestern Honduras to
        villages which had not seen a doctor since Hurricane
        Mitch hit. In each location more the 500 people lined up
        for health call, once in a school and once in a church.
        Dr. Espana was able to see and prescribe medication for
        approximately 180 people in each location. The team
        worked each day until after dark, but had to return to
        San Pero Sula before the curfew at 11:00 PM.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope that
        these pictures will help to tell the story of how
        important the MAP International medications are to the
        poor in the mountains of Honduras. We are very grateful
        for your help in getting these Travel Packs to us so
        quickly. We have been told that we were the first to
        arrive, with medicine, in this area of the country of
        Honduras. We hope to send couriers again in the near
        future and we will be in touch as we know what our plans
        will be.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="3">Again, many thanks for
        your help<br>
        and a Happy Advent to you both,</font></p>
