    <p><font color="#000000">The state of the world's health shows both unprecedented progress
    in the past 50 years, and unspeakable misery. We have the technology to implant a heart
    and reconnect severed nerve endings, while more than one-half the children who die in the
    developing world die of diarrheal disease or respiratory infections. One out of every
    three people on earth lives in abject poverty.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">It is into this world that the United States office of MAP
    International has stepped to meet the material and training needs of health care
    professionals serving people in crisis around the world. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">In 1954, MAP first began providing donated medicines to health
    care workers traveling into the developing world to assist hospitals and clinics serving
    those most in need. Since that time, MAP-U.S. has become one of the world's largest
    providers of medicines and supplies to mission hospitals, clinics and refugee centers. At
    the same time, MAP-U.S. provides training, information and educational opportunities to
    physicians, medical students, nurses and other health professionals, as well as church
    leaders and others who are committed to serving the world's hurting people.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">MAP's work makes a difference. In Zaire, medicines and supplies
    provided to a hospital helped stem the tide of deadly cholera cases that began during a
    civil war. The hospital &quot;played a very important role in caring for the war wounded
    in Goma, thanks to your moral, material and financial support,&quot; the chief physician
    wrote to MAP. In Guatemala, hepatitis B vaccines helped the children of very low-income
    families. &quot;The footprints of caring you left . . . will last in the years to come in
    smiling and healthy children,&quot; a leading Guatemala political figure wrote. MAP's
    fellowship program for medical students changes lives. &quot;My experience in India
    cemented my desire to pursue work among the poor, and I am now medical director of a
    migrant and community health center in rural North Carolina.&quot; one former student
    wrote.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#000000">Her name is Furaha. It means &quot;joy.&quot; She experienced
    little of it in her first months of life.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">The infant girl lived, along with her parents and 500,000 other
    Rwandan refugees, in a refugee camp in eastern Zaire until war once again forced them to
    flee. In the confusion, she was separated from her parents and left, helpless, in the
    camp. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Then a miracle happened. Kanyindi Sujana, the mother of three
    other children, found Furaha. Out of compassion, Kanyindi took the infant along as her
    family walked for miles back to Rwanda.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Soon, however, Furaha became ill. Kanyindi knew that if she
    walked back into Zaire she could find care for the infant at Virunga Hospital in Goma. So
    she left her family behind with others and carried Furaha to Goma. At Virunga, Furaha
    became one of the many who were saved from deadly cholera by emergency relief medicines
    provided by MAP International.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Medical Supply<br>
    </strong>The Medical Supply Program is one of the world's largest providers of medicines
    and supplies to mission hospitals, clinics, refugee centers and physicians serving the
    health needs of the world's poorest communities. MAP distributes high-quality,
    FDA-approved medicines and supplies valued at nearly $90 million each year. The medicines
    and supplies are donated to MAP by leading U.S. health care companies and purchased from
    low-cost international suppliers. Through a network of partner agencies, the Medical
    Supply Program reaches into some 100 nations each year. To meet the needs of physicians
    serving on short-term missions, MAP provides specially-packed medicine kits that are easy
    to carry during international travel.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Disaster Relief</strong><br>
    MAP responds quickly to humanitarian emergencies caused by war or natural disaster
    anywhere in the world by providing the medicines and supplies needed to save lives. MAP
    closely monitors world events and crises and keeps in close contact with other private
    organizations and government entities to ensure appropriate relief supplies are provided
    when and where they are needed. In the U.S., MAP provides materials and personnel to aid
    federal disaster response medical teams called into action. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><strong>International Medical Fellowships<br>
    </strong>More than 1,700 senior medical students from the U.S. and Canada have received
    life-changing training in overseas mission hospitals through the MAP/Reader's Digest
    International Fellowship program. The goal of the program is to encourage these students
    to commit, either full or part-time, to Christian health care ministries in the developing
    world.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#000000">At the United States office of MAP International, we have renewed
    our commitment to reach more people with a practical demonstration of caring. Much of our
    work is centered on the goal of serving the health care professionals and institutions
    that in turn serve those in need. We're going to continue to do this, but also learn how
    we can more directly/effectively serve the poorest communities in the world.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">My vision is to continue to consolidate and improve our service
    to other organizations around the world. In doing that, I want to focus attention as well
    on the indigenous institutional structures, including the church and other community-based
    organizations, that are emerging in the developing world. That means helping to upgrade
    health care systems and resources in the communities in which we work. I also want to
    improve our ability to respond more effectively in the area of disaster relief.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">I look forward to serving with you as together we carry
    lifesaving medicines, relief and development assistance to some of the neediest people on
    earth.</font></p>
