<p><strong><big>Sudan </big><br>
</strong>September 24, 1998</p>

<p>In Southwestern Sudan, site of the worst famine in Africa in a decade, 770,000 people
are threatened with death by starvation and related disease. The dramatic plight of the
people of this region of Sudan has been the focus of increased attention by humanitarian
organizations and the media. A compelling report on the famine appeared recently in the <a
href="http://www.ajc.com">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>. <br>
<br>
For the past five years, MAP International has provided into Southern Sudan vital
medicines and supplies needed to combat the diseases caused by famine. MAP has shipped
humanitarian aid valued at nearly $7 million to the region during that time.<br>
<br>
MAP's commitment continues. Two large containers are now being readied for shipment with
up to 100,000 pounds of medicines and supplies.<br>
<br>
MAP is working with a variety of partners to support health centers and clinics,
hospitals, refugee camps and feeding centers where health workers are in desperate need of
basic medicines and supplies.<br>
<br>
MAP responds to natural and manmade disasters around the world to ensure that appropriate
medicines and supplies reach those most in need.<br>
<br>
Funds are still needed to support the Sudan relief effort and MAP's other relief work
around the world.<br>
<br>
Call 1-800-225-8550 to respond or for more information.</p>
