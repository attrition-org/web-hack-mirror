<p><strong><a name="$50,000 OF MEDICAL RELIEF FOR NAIROBI">$50,000 OF MEDICAL RELIEF FOR
NAIROBI</a> BOMBING VICTIMS DISPATCHED FROM GEORGIA</strong></p>

<p>Arriving on the scene shortly after bombs ripped through Nairobi and Dar es Salaam last
Friday, staff members from MAP International quickly mobilized to purchase and distribute
medicines to victims of the Nairobi blast.</p>

<p>With more than 5,000 people injured in the bombings, MAP will continue relief efforts
as it dispatches two disaster modules containing $50,000 of medicines and medical supplies
from Georgia-based headquarters.</p>

<p>The disaster modules, donated by Johnson &amp; Johnson, a major donor of appropriate
medicines to MAP International, will depart Brunswick, GA for Atlanta on Thursday at 1
p.m. The shipment will then travel from Hartsfield International Airport to London, en
route to Nairobi. The medicines will arrive in Nairobi at 8:50 a.m. on Sunday, Aug. 16,
and have been consigned to the National Operations Center in the Office of the President
of Kenya. Shipping costs to Africa are being paid by MAP and the Southern Baptist Mission
Board.</p>

<p>The modules, containing antibiotics, analgesics, lotions, and topical creams, as well
as supplies like tape and gauze, will be distributed to medical personnel at the National
Operations Center and Kenyatta National Hospital.</p>

<p>Providing medicines and health care in crises since 1954, MAP has responded to numerous
disaster situations. During the 1996 earthquake in Quito, Ecuador, MAP staff members from
Latin America were among the first to arrive on the scene with emergency medicine. The
following year, MAP responded to the massive flooding in Acapulco, Mexico with $200,000
worth of medicines and supplies.</p>

<p>MAP International's relief programs have provided medicines and hospital supplies in
more than 100 countries to meet long-term health needs and to aid in disaster relief. MAP
has orchestrated to unprecedented donation of $1 billion in medical supplies in the past
44 years, often partnering with other relief organizations such as Mercy Corps., World
Vision, International Red Cross, Salvation Army, and Food For the Hungry. MAP is planning
to open an international office Atlanta, Ga. in 1999.</p>

<p>For more information about MAP International's programs or to offer volunteer
assistance call Suzanne Baroody at (800) 225-8550.</p>
