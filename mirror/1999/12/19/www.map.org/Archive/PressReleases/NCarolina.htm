ITEMS TO HURRICANE VICTIMS IN NORTH CAROLINA</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brunswick, GA September 23, In the wake of Hurricane Floyd, floods of biblical
proportions drown the dreams of the residents of Tarboro, N. Carolina and surrounding
areas. Even now over 10,000 people are homeless and in shelters. But amid the suffering,
hope takes the shape of makeshift villages of campers and trailer homes. Thousands of
people struggle to reassemble their lives without electricity, running water or basic
hygiene supplies.</p>

<p>Through the generosity of the residents and businesses of Glynn and surrounding
counties, MAP International is sending over one (1) ton of personal care items such as
toothpaste, soap, shampoo, combs/brushes, baby powder and disposable diapers. A local
Brunswick quilting group meeting weekly at St. James Lutheran church, is providing four
(4) boxes of handmade quilts. &quot;Imagine the warmth of having something that belongs to
just you,&quot; said Patti Sandow, MAP&#146;s Manager of Gift in Kind Acquisition.
&quot;Those children have lost everything. The quilts will surround them with our
love.&quot;</p>

<p>These items are being shipped to the Reverend Jan Milton in Fayetteville, NC for
distribution . The items will be personally handed out among the shelter residents by the
retired members of a local congregation.</p>

<p>&quot;This isn&#146;t the first time our community has come through for the less
fortunate,&quot; said Suzanne Baroody, MAP&#146;s Director of Public Relations, &quot;Our
generous citizens recently provided a ton of personal care items for the Kosovo crisis. We
are proud to be located in Brunswick and members of such a caring community.&quot;</p>
