<p ALIGN="CENTER">MAP INTERNATIONAL WORKS WITH UNHCR/WHO SANCTIONED AGENCY TO SEND $1.1
MILLION IN MEDICINES AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO KOSOVAR REFUGEES</b></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Brunswick, GA, -- MAP (Medical Assistance Programs) International is
working through International Medical Corp (IMC) headquartered in California, to send over
$1.1 million in medicines, medical supplies and personal care items to the Kosovar
refugees in camps in Albania and Macedonia. IMC is a UNHCR/WHO sanctioned agency who has
been given the responsibility for health related matters for refugees in Albania. MAP is
their <i>primary provider</i> <i>of medicines and medical supplies for this crisis.</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">IMC presently has staff in Tirana, Kukes, Shkoder and Durres. Working
beside Albanian and Kosovar physicians, MAP's medicines and medical supplies will assist
them in providing medical services and running mobile clinics - four in Macedonia and ten
in Albania. A mobile clinic in Macedonia reported processing one patient every 30 seconds
-- 3,000 a day. &nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">IMC has requested of MAP a medical relief shipment to include over $1.1
million (wholesale value) of desperately needed life saving medicines such as antibiotics,
children's analgesics and cold and cough syrup, and oral rehydration salts. These
medicines and additional first aid supplies, antibacterial soaps, and personal care items,
will be airlifted to nearly 1 million people residing in squalid conditions in Balkan
refugee camps. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">MAP's Relief Director John Garvin, and Mark Mosely, Director of
International Medical Resources will arrive in Albania next week for immediate assessment
of the situation and follow-up on the implementation of MAP's medical aid shipments.
&quot;MAP is one of the primary groups ministering to health related needs.&quot; said
Garvin. &quot;Our focus is on strategic long-term partnership with other humanitarian
agencies who have a permanent presence in the area&quot;. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">MAP International is a 45 year old Christian, non sectarian relief and
development agency with health care programs in over 130 developing countries. MAP has
assisted the people of the Balkan area since the late 1980's. Every $1.00 provides at
least $15.00 in medicines and medical supplies.&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Only 1.4% of revenue is used for administration and fundraising.
Contributions and requests for information or interviews, should be directed to Suzanne
Baroody, Director of Public Relations.</p>
