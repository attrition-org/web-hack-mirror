<p ALIGN="CENTER">MAP INTERNATIONAL STANDS READY TO ASSIST IN KOSOVO WITH DESPERATELY
NEEDED MEDICINES AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Brunswick, GA, -- In a joint effort with partner humanitarian agencies,
MAP (Medical Assistance Programs) International is mobilizing shipments of medicines and
medical supplies to war torn Kosovo. With all foreign personnel having been evacuated, MAP
is fortunate to be in partnership with other Christian agencies which have ongoing
programs in the region, and who will return once the bombing has subsided and a complete
needs assessment can be done.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">MAP International is currently mobilizing shipments of first aid items,
personal care and hygiene products and any other health related product needs for refugees
fleeing from the crisis. MAP International has been actively delivering relief supplies
into the Balkans since the late 1980's. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;The recent crisis created by Hurricane Mitch has seriously impacted
MAP's financial resources, said MAP spokesperson, Suzanne Baroody. &quot;The generosity of
the American people is needed now more than ever.&quot; To donate to the &quot;Kosovo
Relief Fund&quot;, call 1-800-225-8550. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">MAP International is a non-profit Christian relief and development
organization providing disaster relief and community based health care programs in the US
and developing world for over 45 years. Of every $1.00 donated, MAP provides $15.00 in
medicines and/or medical supplies. Our administrative and fundraising expenses total only
1.4% of total revenue. </p>
