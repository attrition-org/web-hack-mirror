<center>FAIR Congressional Briefing<br><font size="4"><b>Immigration and Poverty</font></b><br>Thursday, October 14<br></center>
<br>
On October 14, FAIR co-hosted, along with the University of Denver’s Center for Public Policy and Contemporary Issues, an academic conference on “Immigration and Poverty in America.”  Capitol Hill staff were joined in the Rayburn House Office Building by internationally known experts:<ul><li
<li> Moderator Richard Lamm (former Governor of Colorado and director of the University of Denver’s Center for Public Policy);<br>
<li>Vernon Briggs (Cornell University Professor of Labor Economics and author of Mass Immigration and the National Interest);<br>
<li>George Borjas (Harvard University Professor of Public Policy and author of the new best seller Heaven’s Door: Immigration Policy and the American Economy);<br>
<li>Lindsay Lowell (Georgetown University Director of Research and a member of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform);<br>
<li>James Gimpel (Professor of Government at the University of Maryland and author of the forthcoming book Separate Destinations, on immigration and ethnic balkanization);<br>
<li>Lawrence Harrison (Senior Fellow at Harvard University and author of Who Prospers?, which examines the relationship between culture and success).</ul><p>

While some panel members were more cautious than others, the consensus of the symposium was clear:  mass immigration of low-skilled foreigners has dramatically increased poverty in our society.  The size of the poor population is enlarged not simply by adding poor immigrants to its numbers, they pointed out, but also by lowering the wages and working conditions for low-skilled Americans, helping to drive them into poverty as well.  <p>

Panelists also noted the ancillary problems caused by this growth in poverty, including civic alienation, political apathy, ethnic balkanization, widening gaps between the classes, erosion of the middle class, and social instability.<p>
