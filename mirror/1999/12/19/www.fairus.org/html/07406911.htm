<center>Rep. Paul Works Overtime to Insure Border Controls Can Never Stem the Tide of Illegal Immigration</center>
<p>
"When it comes to encouraging illegal immigration, Texas Rep. Ron Paul's record is unmatched," says the national organization FAIR, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), a group working to stop illegal immigration.  "Paul has consistently worked to undermine any rational effort to stem the tide of illegal immigration," says FAIR's executive director, Dan Stein.
<p>
FAIR cited the following as evidence of his record:
<p><ul>
<li>Paul's work to reward illegal immigrant law-breakers by voting to allow them to pay $1,000 to avoid penalties for violating immigration laws.  
<li>Paul's vote to expand a fraud-ridden visa waiver program.
<li>Paul's attempt to prevent efforts to eliminate voter fraud.</uL>
<P>
Now Paul is taking credit for repealing an important anti-fraud measure that was designed to insure illegal aliens couldn't get jobs in this country, section 656(b) of the 1996 immigration reform bill.  "Paul claims it would erode privacy even though the measure merely sought to prevent document fraud through the verification of information already required by law," said Stein.
<p>
"To effect this repeal, Paul and his allies persistently misrepresented the provision in the press," he said.
<p>
FAIR noted that Paul's policy positions on illegal immigration are bogus, noting that in a 1993 op-ed in the Houston Chronicle, he wrote as follows:  "The immigration problem can be addressed in other ways.  For example, the federal government can allow states and localities to deny benefits to aliens, as California Gov. Pete Wilson is demanding."  
<p>
The problem, asks FAIR?   "Rep. Paul is a hypocrite.  He says no welfare but has worked to make it impossible to verify welfare eligibility by his very own actions in Congress.  Without secure documents, illegal aliens can collect welfare and other benefits - it's epidemic," says Stein.   "We'll never get control of the borders if illegal aliens can vote, get benefits and welfare after they get in.  Thanks a lot, Rep. Paul."
