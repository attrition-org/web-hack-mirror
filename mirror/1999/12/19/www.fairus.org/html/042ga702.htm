<b> 1990 CENSUS DATA ON THE FOREIGN BORN </b><br>
Between the 1980 and 1990 Censuses, the population of Georgia grew by 18.2%.  The
state's foreign-born population (173,000)  grew by 89.3% during that same period and accounted
for 8.2% of the state's overall population growth.  The rate of growth of the immigrant
population in Georgia is the 2nd fastest in the country (after Nevada).  The foreign-born
share of the Atlanta MSA's population is 4.4%, less than the national average of 7.9%.  The
foreign-born share for the rest of the state averaged about 1%. <p>

All of the national groups making up Georgia's top ten foreign-born list in 1990 registered an
increase from 1980, except for the German-born, which registered a slight decline.  At the top of
the list were the Mexican born.  The nearly 19,000 they gained from 1980 represented a
gain of about 1300%, and constituted 23% of the total gain among all foreign-born groups. 
Other national groups registering large gains were among those born in Korea (+128%), India
(+208%), Vietnam (+196%), Japan (+84%) and Philippines (+108%).  <p>

Census Bureau reports show that Georgia had the highest rate of growth (93.5%) in immigrant
population <b> of any state </b> between 1990 and 1994.  Georgia also ranked fourth for largest
numerical growth in its immigrant population in the same period, at 161,874 immigrants. 
Because this number is much higher than the number of new immigrants headed for Georgia, it
appears that many earlier immigrants, who settled elsewhere, are re-migrating to Georgia. <p>

DeKalb County has the states largest Vietnamese population (2,210) followed by Gwinnett
(2,443), Fulton (2,245), and Clayton (2,210 -- up from 574 in 1990).<br>
<font size="-1"> (<em>Atlanta Constitution</em>, January 8, 1998) </font><p>  

<b>THE IMMIGRANT STOCK</b><br>
There are about 441 thousand people in Georgia who may be considered "immgrant stock."
The immigrant stock is a term that refers to first generation immigrants, the "1.5 generation" 
(children of immigrants who are born abroad), and the second generation (the native-born Americans whose parents immigrated).<p>

<b> 1998 CPS DATA ON THE FOREIGN BORN </b><br>
In the most recent Census Bureau estimate, Georgia's overall population increased by about
160,000 (2.1%).  The 1998 CPS data, analyzed by the Center for Immigration Studies, showed
the immigrant population dropped slightly.  As a result of these two trends, the share of the
state's population comprised of immigrants dropped marginally to  2.9 percent.<br>
[FAIR Comment:  We think it unlikely -- given the high number of new legal and illegal
immigrants settling in Georgia -- that the immigrant population actually dropped, but it is
possible if a still larger number moved elsewhere in the United States, returned abroad, and died. 
However, we are more inclined to attribute this apparent aberration to sampling error].<p>

The Census Bureau calculates that since the 1990 Census the state's population has increased by
over 90,000 because of immigration, while over the same period the state's population has
increased by about 598,000 due to the arrival of migrants from other states.<p>

<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/ga-net.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

<b> 1997 CPS DATA ON THE FOREIGN BORN </b><br>
The segment of the foreign-born population that had become U.S. citizens as of 1997 was 36.9
percent --slightly higher than the 35 percent national average.<p>

<b>NET INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION</b><br>
The Census Bureau estimates that Georgia's population increased by 151,968 over the last
year (ending in July 1997).  Compared to that overall increase, net international migration
accounted for an estimated increase of 10,831.  Thus immigration accounted for about seven
percent of the state's population increase (that is about a quarter of the national median share of
population increase due to immigration).<p>

<b>INS DATA ON IMMIGRANT SETTLEMENT</b><br>
Immigrant settlement in Georgia has risen since 
the adoption of the current immigration system in 1965.  The average settlement recently is more than five times what it was in the late 1960s.<p>  
<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/gains.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center>
<p>

New legal immigrants continue to arrive in Georgia since 1990 at an average annual rate of about
13,000 according to INS data through FY'97.  The average is inflated a bit by the impact of the
1986 amnesty for illegal aliens.  The number of "new" immigrants in FY'91 -- over double the
average -- included many former illegal aliens already living in Georgia, who benefitted from the
amnesty.  Just among the long-term resident amnesty applicants (excluding the amnestied agricultural workers), the number of applicants from Georgia was 6,675. 
Data for FY'95, FY'97 and FY'98 were artificially low because the INS was not able to issue green cards
to all the applicants for adjustment of status who were already in the United States.  In those three
years, new immigration could have registered as much as 30 percent higher, if the INS had issued
more visas.<p>

Between FY'91 to FY'97 over 92,000 immigrants indicated that they intended to reside
in Georgia.  Over one-third (33.4%) of the newcomers were accounted for by immigrants from
two countries: Mexico (20.3%) and Vietnam (13.1%).  
The annual totals of immigrants to Georgia are listed below, and connections are provided to
access detailed tables that provide INS data by nationality of the new immigrants.<PRE>

<b>POPULATION CHANGE 1900-2000</b><br>
It helps to have a clear perspective of the past population change that the state has experienced
when considering the role of immigration in Georgia's current and future population change.  
Over the past 50 years, the population of the state has more than doubled.  More of
recent population growth has come from net inter-state and international migration than from
natural population change, e.g., birth rates, to which immigrants also contribute. <p>

<b>POPULATION PROJECTION</b><br>
The 1997 Census Bureau population projection has Georgia's population growing by 37%
between 1995 and 2025 (to 9,869,000).  That is the 15th fastest projected rate of growth in the
country.  The rate of increase in the foreign-born population between 1980 and 1990 was
even higher than the projected overall population rate of increase, and it is clear that the
projection contemplates continued high-volume immigrant settlement in the state.<p>

The Census Bureau population projection noted above is the "middle" projection, and it assumes
immigration at a net annual increase of 820,000.  There are other projections based on different
assumptions.  In the Census Bureau's "high" immigration projection, assuming annual net
immigration of 1,370,000, the population in 2025 is more than six percent higher than in the
middle projection, and it is over 11 percent higher by 2050.  For Georgia, the high projection
could mean a population in 2050 of 13,000,000 to 15,500,000.  If immigration were
significantly scaled back, the population increase attributable to immigration and the
population spill-over effects from other states could be significantly reduced over time.  See <a

<b>INS ESTIMATE OF ALIENS ELIGIBLE FOR CITIZENSHIP</b><br>
The INS estimates that as of April 1996 there were about 102,000 legal resident aliens in
Georgia -- legal immigrants who had not yet become U.S. citizens -- of whom
51,000 had met the residency requirement to apply for citizenship.  Included in this number
could be aliens who had already applied for naturalization and were in the processing waiting
list.  The INS offices that handle naturalization cases and fingerprinting are located

<b>SOCIAL AND OTHER ISSUES </b><br>
Residents of Doraville protested plans to allow the International Village, a shopping center aimed
at immigrants, to be zoned in a way that would allow residences to be built over street-level
shops.  The zoning, which could cause increased congestion in the small town, was also intended
to attract low-rent housing, thereby decreasing property values. <br>

Georgia will have to build almost one new school each month for the next 25 years just to keep

FAIR estimates that the net cost of Georgia's foreign-born population was over $907 million in
1995 due to the public services they consume and their displacement of American workers
throughout the state. <p>

Along with the growing illegal immigrant population in the state, there is a growing problem
with illegal employment of juveniles.  The fake ID that gets an illegal alien a job is also used to
pass off an underage alien as old enough to work.  The illegal employment of children has
become a problem not just in agricultural work, where federal law allows children as young as 12
to work outside of school hours, but also in poultry processing, where 16 year-olds may work
outside of work hours.
<font size="-1"> (AP story by Joan Kirchner in <i>The Latino Voice,</i> Jan.-Feb.
1998)</font><p>

<b> ILLEGAL RESIDENT ALIENS </b><br>
The INS estimates the resident illegal alien population of Georgia to be 32,000 as of October
1996.  This estimate represents an increase of 6,000 over the number of illegal aliens in October
1992.  <p>

Stirred by the agriculture industry, the state is a popular destination for illegal aliens who work
the farms.  The record fine levied by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for knowingly
employing illegal aliens, $1.1 million, was against Lane Packing Co., Fort Valley, Ga., a peach
harvester.  A smuggling ring was bringing in about 500 aliens a month over two years of
harvesting seasons. <br>
<font size="-1"> (<em> New York Times</em>, February 8, 1992) </font><p>

There are an estimated 80,000 illegal aliens residing in the Atlanta area [note the great difference
in this estimate and the official one of the INS stated above].  They often squeeze six
to eight people into run-down trailers or apartments.  These illegal immigrants usually make
about $200 a week, but most of their wages go to pay off the "coyote" who smuggled them to the
United States, leaving them with little left over for basic living expenses.  Agriculture is not the
only industry that attracts illegal aliens into Georgia. The state's carpet mills and poultry
processing factories are notorious for hiring illegal aliens.  From March 1991 through February
1992, the INS issued $1.35 million in fines against 25 employers. <br>
<font size="-1"> (<em> Atlanta Journal/Constitution</em>, April 12, 1992) </font><p>

Georgia is not typically known for being a state with high levels of immigrants, but the Atlanta,

decade.  <br>

The owner of Atlantic Finishing Inc. in Trenton, Georgia has been charged in a major federal
investigation in Albuquerque, N.M. with recruiting illegal aliens in Mexico to work in his
Trenton plant and a second plant in Henagar, Ala.  According to federal immigration officials

U.S.-based company.<br>
<font size="-1"> (<i>Washington Times,</i> December 26, 1997) </font><p>

In mid-May 1998, during the harvest of the $90 million Vidalia onion crop in southeastern
Georgia, the INS launched operation "Southern Denial" and apprehended 21 illegal alien workers
in Glennville.  The INS action led to a political firestorm reportedly involving House Speaker
Gingrich and negotiations between the INS and the Georgia onion growers that led to a halt to
INS enforcement actions.  The growers for their part were asked to agree to avoid hiring illegal
alien workers next year and participation in a document verification program.  Sen. Coverdell (R-
GA) complained that the INS used "indiscriminate and inappropriate ...tactics against... honest
farmers..."  The INS action may have been triggered by a dispute between several of the 215
growers and the Department of Labor in 1997 over their interest in hiring temporary foreign
agricultural workers in the H-2A program.  The growers withdrew their applications when the
DOL refused to approve them unless the growers agreed to pay the prevailing wage of 80 cents
per 50-pound bag harvested.  The growers insisted that the prevailing wage was 75 cents for a
60-pound bag.  Another issue of contention was that the growers would have to provide free
housing for the 1,200 H-2A temporary workers they were requesting as well as for their
American workers.<br>
<font size="-1"> (<i>Washington Post,</i> July 5, 1998,  <i>Chicago Tribune,</i> May 28,
1998, ) </font><p>

 After an agreement was reached between Vidalia onion growers and the INS, further raids
during the harvest season were halted.  The growers promised to cooperate in the 1999 harvest
with an INS program to verify the legal status of newly hired workers.  However, with the
prospect that Congress would adopt a  new AgJobs program for temporary foreign workers,
several Georgia onion growers pulled out of the agreement.  With the legislative defeat in
October of the proposed new program, several growers have begun constructing farm worker
housing in anticipation of requesting H-2A workers in 1999. <br>

On November 29, police stopped a rental van near Rio Puerco, New Mexico and found it
crammed with 34 illegal Mexican immigrants including three small children.  They had crossed
the border at Nogales on Thanksgiving day, spent two days in a safe house in Phoenix and were
being transported through New Mexico on their way to cities like Amarillo, Dallas, and Atlanta -
- the final destination.  The Mexicans were paying $1,500 to $2,000 to the smuggler.  The
vehicle driver was a Mexican, from the village as all of the smuggled aliens,  who had a U.S.
green card and lives in North Carolina.  Authorities decided not to try to prosecute him when
none of the passengers would testify against him.
