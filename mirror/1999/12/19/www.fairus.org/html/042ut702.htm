<b> 1980 AND 1990 CENSUS DATA </b><br>
The 1980 Census recorded about 50,500 foreign-born residents in Utah.  They were largely from
traditional immigrant source countries, like Germany, Canada, and the United
Kingdom.  At that time Mexico was in 4th place and the Netherlands
in 5th place.  By the 1990 Census, Mexican immigrants had more than doubled and moved to 1st place.  With
the exception of immigrants from Canada (+ 6%), traditional immigrant
populations were dropping (Germany -17%, U.K. - 12%, Netherlands -27%).  At the same time
newer immigrant communities were growing like the Mexicans (Vietnam +48% and Tonga
+25%)<p>

The overall total had grown by 16 percent (from 50,451 to 58,600).  The state's overall growth rate was similar (+
18% - from about 1,472,000 to 1,722,850).  With only 3.4% of its 1990 population made up of immigrants, Utah is less affected by the
current record level of immigrants than the nation as a whole (7.9%
foreign-born population in 1990) -- but note above that since 1990, the immigrant share is rising rapidly. <p>

More than four out of every five immigrants in the state live in the Salt Lake City metropolitan
area.  The foreign-born share there is nearly 4%.  For the rest of the state, it is about 1.4%. <p>

About 60% of Utah's foreign-born population came to the state since 1980, causing the Hispanic
population  in some remote counties to triple and quadruple in 14 years.  For example,
the number of Latinos in Cache county increased from 700 in 1980 to 2,800 in 1994 as the E. A.
Miller slaughterhouse located in Hyrum hired Latinos.  Over half of the company's 1,400
workers are Latinos.<br>

In 1990, over half of Utah's foreign-born population were not naturalized citizens.<br>

<a name="stock"><b>THE IMMIGRANT STOCK</b><br>
There were about 289 thousand people in Utah in 1997 who may be considered "immgrant stock."
The immigrant stock is a term that refers to first generation immigrants, the "1.5 generation" 
(children of immigrants who are born abroad), and the second generation (the native-born Americans whose parents immigrated).<p>

<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/ut-net.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

<a name="cps"><b> 1998 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS) DATA </b><br>
The Census Bureau's 2,099,758 population estimate for Utah, based on 1988 CPS data, shows a
population increase of about 35,000 over a year earlier (2,065,001).  Over the same period the CPS shows the
immigrant population increasing by about 5,600. Thus immigrant settlement accounted for a bit
less than one-eighth of population increase.  Since the 1990 Census, the Census Bureau estimates
that the state has increased in population by  over 86,000 as a result of net domestic migration
into the state and by about 27,000 as a result of net international migration.<p>

<b> 1997 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS) DATA </b><br>
Utah has the seventh fastest growing immigrant population in the country, based on a
comparison of the 1997 CPS data and the 1990 Census.<p>  

<b>POPULATION CHANGE 1900-2000</b><br>
When considering the role of  immigration in Utah's current and future population change, it
is helpful to have a clear perspective of the past population change that the state has
experienced.  Over the past 50 years, the population of the state has tripled.  Most of
recent population growth has come from natural birth rates, but the arrival of immigrants and
persons moving from other states has also been a significant factor in the recent increase. <p>

<a name="project"><b>POPULATION PROJECTION</b><br>
The 1997 Census Bureau population projection has Utah's population growing by 48%
between 1995 and 2025 (to 2,883,000).  That is the 7th fastest projected rate of growth in the
country.  The rate of increase in the foreign-born population between 1980 and 1990 was
even higher than the projected rate, and it is clear that the projection contemplates continued
high-volume immigrant settlement in the state.<p>

The Census Bureau population projection noted above is the "middle" projection, and it assumes
immigration at a net annual increase of 820,000.  There are other projections based on different
assumptions.  In the Census Bureau's "high" immigration projection, assuming annual net
immigration of 1,370,000, the population in 2025 is more than six percent higher than in the
middle projection, and it is over 11 percent higher by 2050.  For Utah, the high projection
could mean a population in 2050 of 3,900,000 to 5,100,000.  If today's mass immigration were
significantly scaled back, the population increase attributable to immigration and the
population spill-over effects from other states could be significantly reduced over time.  See <a
href="04109604.htm">Immigration and Population Growth</a></font><p>

<b>NET INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION</b><br>
The Census Bureau estimates that Utah's population grew by 41,575 over the last year (ending in
July 1997).  Of that amount of increase, 3,846 (9.3%) was attributed to net international
migration (arrivals minus departures).  Utah is toward the bottom of a ranking of states in terms
of the impact of immigration on population growth (41st).<p>

<b>METROPOLITAN AREA DATA<br><center> <a href="msas/042utslo.htm">SALT LAKE
CITY-OGDEN</a><br><a
href="msas/042utpro.htm">PROVO-OREM</a></b></center><p>
In 1990, about 3/5 of all of Utah's immigrants were located in Salt Lake City county (over
34,000), and over 13,000 lived within the city.  Other cities with significant numbers of
immigrants are Provo (with nearly 5,000) and Logan (with about half that amount).  <br>

<a name="legal"><a name="107"><b>INS DATA ON IMMIGRANT SETTLEMENT</b><br>
Immigrant settlement in Utah has risen since 
the adoption of the current immigration system in 1965.  The recent rate of new immigrants is more than triple the rate of the late 1960s.<p>
<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/utins.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

Since 1990, legal immigrants who identified Utah as their intended residence have averaged over
3,500 per year through FY'97.  The data for fiscal year (FY) 1991 were artificially raised by the
inclusion of some of the former illegal aliens who were amnestied in 1986.  
Just among the long-term resident amnesty applicants (excluding the amnestied agricultural workers), the number applying from Utah was 2,583.  
The data for FY'95
and FY'97 were artificially low because the INS was not able to issue green cards to all the
applicants for adjustment of status who were already in the United States.  In those two years,
new immigration could have registered as much as 30 percent higher, if the INS had issued more
visas.<center>

<b>INS DATA BY NATIONALITY: FY'91 - FY'97</b><br>
The INS data below are furnished for nationals of the countries with the largest number of
immigrants admitted or adjusted to legal residence each year since 1990. The absence of data
means that the total number of admissions to the United States by nationals of that country were
not enough to merit detailed reporting in that year.<p>

The nationalities may change each year, so the totals in some cases will not reflect all the
immigrants of that nationality who have become legal immigrants in Utah during the seven-year
period. The 24 nationalities (Hong Kong and Taiwan included with mainland Chinese, and Russia
and Ukraine included with Soviet Union) represent nearly three-quarters (76%) of all immigrant
settlement and adjustment in Utah during this period. <center>

Note that legal immigrant settlement data during this period was influenced by adjustment of
status of immigrants who had been in illegal status until the amnesty that was adopted in the
1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA). This IRCA adjustment data -- which was
still at the surge level in FY-91 affected adjustments in Utah, principally with about 2,500
Mexicans adjusting to legal status.<p>

<b>SOCIAL AND OTHER ISSUES</b><br>
 Formerly migrant workers from Mexico are settling down in Utah as permanent residents and
becoming year-round workers in the meat packing industry.  Utah State University economist
Dawn Thilmany believes that many immigrants are filling jobs that otherwise may not have been
filled.<p>

State officials say about 6,400 legal immigrants receive food stamps, representing 6% of
the 107,299 Food Stamp recipients in the state (compared to 3.4% of the population). <br>

The INS currently estimates the resident illegal alien population of Utah to be about 15,000 as of

in October 1992. <p>

There were 2,583 applications for the amnesty from Utah, and most of them were from
Mexicans. <p>

According to police records, illegal aliens were involved in 80% of Utah's arrests for felony-level
narcotics violations in 1995.  Assessing Utah's illegal immigrant problem in the November issue
of the Utah Bar Journal, Third District Judge Michael Hutchings said that deported illegal
immigrants return to Salt Lake City because it is a profitable and "thriving open air drug market".
<br>
(<i> Salt Lake Tribune,</i> 12/6/96) <p> 

INS records show a total of 17,529 additional immigrants who listed Utah as their state of
intended residence between fiscal year 1991 and fiscal year 1995.  That number includes illegal
aliens who were granted legal residence as a result of the 1986 Immigration Reform Control Act. 
<p>

<a name="113">The apprehension of 19 illegal aliens following a truck accident on October 24, 1999 points up the increasing use of Utah as a corridor for illegal alien smuggling.  
According to an INS spokesperson "Most of the people that are transiting through Utah and Colorado are going to the east coast." <br>

The accident occured on highway I-70 west of Green River in Emery County.  
The 19, who the INS believe also included the driver, were Mexican illegal immigrants.  
The incident was more life threatening than an alien smuggling case a month earlier, when a smuggler abandoned nine illegal immigrants at a rest stop in Thompson, Grand County after getting a flat tire.<br>
