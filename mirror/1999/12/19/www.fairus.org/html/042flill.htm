<h2><p align=center>Florida: Illegal Immigration </p></h2> 
</center><hr>

<b> ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION </b><br>
The INS estimate of illegal immigrants in Florida in October 1996 is about 350,000.  The INS
estimated the illegal resident alien population in Florida as of October 1992 was 270,000.  This
is the fourth largest concentration of illegal aliens in the country, and it reflects a 30% increase
over the past four years.  These are mostly new illegal resident aliens, as the amnesty for illegal
aliens, for which 156,000 applied from Florida, converted the bulk of older illegal aliens in legal
permanent residents.  The state government estimates the illegal alien population higher -- about
420,000 (per the Associated Press, April 22, 1997).<p>

The state of Florida plans to refer welfare clients to jobs once held by deported immigrants. 
Starting in the spring of 1997, federal immigration officers will notify the Florida employment
service about job positions opened by the deportation of undocumented immigrants.  The
employment service will send the employers names of welfare or unemployment clients to fill
the vacant jobs.  A similar arrangement was made in Virginia in October 1996. <br>

An INS raid on December 9 in Sarasota in Southwest Florida led to the arrest of 52 illegal aliens
working for the National Linen Service.  All were Mexicans, and 38 were women.  Because
many employment opportunities are available
and because unemployment is at a 25-year low, illegal aliens are being attracted to the area.
The Tampa office, that was responsible for the raid, is new -- opening in 1996.  It has jurisdiction
for ten counties, including Manatee, Sarasota, Hillsborough and Pinellas, with only six
agents.<br>

An indictment was handed down in Miami on April 23 against 16 members of a family-run
prostitution ring based in Mexico and operating in northern Florida and South Carolina.  Young
Mexican females, some as young as 14-years-old, were lured into "sex slavery" by the promise of
job opportunities in the United States.  After they were smuggled into the country, crossing at
Brownsville, Texas, they were forced to work as prostitutes, primarily as clients of Mexican farm
laborers working illegally in the United States.<br>

According to Rick Grennier, head of Orlando's Border Patrol office, illegal aliens now are found
more often on construction sites than in agriculture.  Recently, a series of raids in the Orlando
area netted more than 150 illegal alien workers, although many escaped detention by jumping
fences.  Union sources say, some contractors are knowingly hiring illegal alien workers and
paying them submarket wages.<br>

With good summer weather has come a surge in smuggling operations to Florida from Caribbean
islands.  In addition to an increased flow of Cuban illegal immigrants, the number of Haitian
illegal entrants has also risen.  In Palm Beach County there were three landings of illegal
Haitians in June and three in May.  In Dade County there were two landings in May.  The INS
characterizes these operations as "cartel-level organization."  In the most recent incident, eight
Haitians were detained at Pompano Beach after being transported from Freeport, Bahamas in a
20-foot motorboat.  They said they had paid $2,500 each for the trip.<br>

Coast Guard and Border Patrol officials say illegal immigration to Florida from the Caribbean
has
increased this year, with organized smugling rings behind many attempts.  On November 12 the
Coast Guard announced the interception of 56 illegal aliens, mostly Haitians, the previous night
in
two operations, one about 9 miles off Lake Worth and the other in international waters southwest
of the Bahamas.<br>
<font size="-1"> (<i>Reuters, </i>November 12, 1998)</font> <p>

Miami police investigating a hotel robbery called the Border Patrol when they found a group of
about two dozen suspected illegal aliens.  The group included 20 Indians , four Ecuadorians and
a Bahamian who was being sought as part of the "Operation Seek and Keep" arrests in November
termed by Atty. Gen. Reno the "largest alien smuggling case ever."  The smuggling operation
specialized in Indian illegal aliens and moved them from India via Moscow, Havana, and the
Bahamas or Ecuador.<br>

"Immigration officials are questioning a group of
               Cuban rafters who came ashore Monday morning.
               Seven men and a woman left Cuba on Friday in
               their search for freedom." <font size="-1">(MSNBC December 9, 1998)</font><p>

<a name="1130">Four aliens who had been earlier deported for various offenses are again in prison in Jacksonville.  
All four had reentered the United States illegally following their deportations.  
One, a Colombian, was identified by the INS at the Luke Butler Correctional Institution where he was imprisoned for a variety of weapons charges.  
He had been deported in 1997 for a 1994 drug conviction.  
A second alien, a Dominican, was apprehended by the INS at the Blount Island Ship Terminal in Jacksonville in June.  
He had been deported from New York City also following a drug conviction.  
A Jamaican who had also been deported from New York City in 1998 was taken into custody by the INS as a result of a disturbance call.  
Lastly, a Mexican woman who had been deported in 1998 from Laredo, Texas was identified by the INS in the Duval County Jail.<br>
