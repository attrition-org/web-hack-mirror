<center>WITH MASSIVE IMMIGRATION "AMNESTY AND REWARD" PROGRAM, SAYS FAIR</center>
<p>

Washington (Nov 10) - The Clinton Administration is trying to add a provision to one of the delayed appropriations bills that would inaugurate yet another amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.  This last minute attempt to jam yet another immigration "amnesty and reward" program for hundreds of thousands - perhaps millions - of illegal immigrants undermines the sincerity of efforts to provide "temporary" protection for people who claim they need it, and makes a mockery both of the legislative process and the immigration controls of the nation.  That's the view of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), a nationwide citizens' lobby working for sensible immigration limits for America.
<p>
FAIR is commenting on last minute efforts by the Clinton Administration to insert the language of H.R. 2722 and H.R. 36 granting Green Cards without regard to prior criminal violations of U.S. immigration law for nationals from El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Haiti.  Hundreds of thousands would get amnesty and a reward of immigration benefits for violating U.S. immigration laws.  A million or more relatives could ultimately benefit from this massive lawlessness.  These bills haven't even received a hearing before a congressional committee, much less been through the normal legislative process.
<p>
"Illegal aliens are pouring across America's borders.  In a cynical ploy to pander to ethnic political leaders, the administration and its allies in Congress are destroying the very foundations of American law on which our liberties are based," said Stein.   "This bill would override the definition of who qualifies for asylum for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens," commented Stein.  He noted that the recipients have repeatedly broken promises to return home now that the political situations in their home countries have settled down.  
<p>
Stein noted that what's called an amnesty is really an amnesty and reward program:  "Congress is not only forgiving violations of law, it is providing additional immigration benefits - a Green Card - as a reward.  Passing another amnesty, instead of focusing on real solutions like interior enforcement, visa control and stepped up deportation, is more cynical politicking," said Stein.  "It sends a signal abroad - yet again - that you should enter illegally and lobby for the next amnesty and reward program."
