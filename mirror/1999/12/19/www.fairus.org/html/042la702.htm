<b> 1990 CENSUS DATA ON THE FOREIGN BORN</b><br>
The 1990 Census recorded about 87,000 foreign-born residents in Louisiana.  This ranks
Louisiana 25th in the country in the number of immigrants.  The foreign-born share (2.1%) was
significantly lower than the 7.9% national foreign-born share. <p>

The share of the 1990 foreign born residing in Louisiana who had arrived in the country after
1980 was 38 percent.<p>

Louisiana's ethnic composition was changing because of immigration.  Seven of the ten largest
national groups in 1990 had increased -- several substantially -- since 1980, while three had
declined.  The gainers were: Vietnam (+24%), Honduras (+49%), Cuba (+3%), Nicaragua
(+111%), India (+112%), Mexico (+78%) and the Philippines (+35%).  The losers were Germany
(-19%), the U.K. (-14%) and Canada (-14%). <p>

<b>THE IMMIGRANT STOCK</b><br>
There are about 181 thousand people in Louisiana who may be considered "immgrant stock."
The immigrant stock is a term that refers to first generation immigrants, the "1.5 generation" 
(children of immigrants who are born abroad), and the second generation (the native-born Americans whose parents immigrated).<p>

<b> 1998 CPS DATA ON THE FOREIGN BORN </b><br>
In the most recent Census Bureau estimate, Louisiana's overall population increased by about
17,000.  The 1998 CPS data, analyzed by the Center for Immigration Studies, showed
the immigrant population increased by about 17,000.  As a result of these two trends, the share of
the state's population comprised of immigrants increased slightly to 2.9 percent.<p>

The Census Bureau calculates that since the 1990 Census the state's population has increased by
over 25,000 because of immigration, while over the same period the state's population has
decreased by about 117,000 due to the net outflow of established residents to other states in
excess of the arrival of migrants from other states.<p>

<b> 1997 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS) DATA </b><br>
Over 62 percent of the immigrant increase occurred in three parishes:  Jefferson
(+5,675), Orleans (+3,996) and E. Baton Rouge (+2,980).  Each of those three parishes had net
exoduses from domestic migration that were greater than the influx of immigrants.<p>

Over half of Louisiana's foreign-born population had become U.S. citizens as of 1997.  That rate
is conciderably higher than the national average (35%) and suggests a more settled immigrant
population.<p>

<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/la-net.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

<b>NET INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION</b><br>
The Census Bureau estimates that Louisiana's population increased by 10,951 over the last
year (ending in July 1997).  Compared to that overall increase, net international migration
accounted for an estimated increase of 2,549.  Thus immigration accounted for over 23 percent of
the state's population increase (that is slightly less than the national median share of
population increase due to immigration).<p>

<b>POPULATION CHANGE 1900-2000</b><br>
When considering the role of immigration in Louisiana's current and future population change, it
is helpful to have a clear perspective of the past population change that the state has
experienced.  Over the past 20 years, the population of the state has leveled off after a long
trend of rapid increase.  The levelling off has come because of net out-migration of residents
to other states.  During the same period there has continued to be net increases from new
immigrant settlement.<p>

<b>POPULATION PROJECTION</b><br>
The 1997 Census Bureau population projection has Louisiana's population growing by 18%
between 1995 and 2025 (to 5,133,000).  That is a lower rate of increase than the national
median.  Population projections are generally based on
current demographic trends.  <p>

The Census Bureau population projection noted above is the "middle" projection, and it assumes
immigration at a net annual increase of 820,000.  There are other projections based on different
assumptions.  In the Census Bureau's "high" immigration projection, assuming annual net
immigration of 1,370,000, the population in 2025 is more than six percent higher than in the
middle projection, and it is over 11 percent higher by 2050.  For Louisiana, the high projection
could mean a population in 2050 of 6,400,000 to 6,500,000.  If immigration were
significantly scaled back, the population increase attributable to immigration and the
population spill-over effects from other states could be significantly reduced over time.  See <a
href="04109604.htm">Immigration and Population Growth</a></font><p>

<a name="1129"><b>INS DATA ON IMMIGRANT SETTLEMENT</b><br>
Immigrant settlement in Louisiana has risen since 
the adoption of the current immigration system in 1965.  Recent average settlement has been nearly double the level of the late 1960s.<p>  
<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/lains.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center>
<p>

Legal immigrant settlement in Louisiana since 1990 has averaged over 3,800 per
year.  The data for fiscal year (FY) 1991 were elevated by the inclusion of some of the former
illegal aliens who were amnestied in 1986.  
Just among the long-term resident amnesty applicants (excluding the amnestied agricultural workers), the number of applicants from Louisiana was 1,836.  

The data for FY'95 and FY'97 were artificially low
because the INS was not able to issue green cards to all the applicants for adjustment of status
who were already in the United States.  In those two years, new immigration could have
registered as much as 30 percent higher, if the INS had issued more visas.<pre>

<b>INS DATA BY NATIONALITY: FY'91-FY'97</b><BR>
The INS data below are the totals for the countries with the largest number of immigrants
admitted or adjusted to legal residence since 1990. The nationalities may change each year, so
the totals in some cases will not reflect all the immigrants of that nationality who have become
legal immigrants in Louisiana during the seven-year period. For example, data on German admissions include only five of the 
seven years and for Japan the admission data are available for only three years. The 30 nationalities (Hong Kong
and Taiwan included with mainland Chinese, and the former Soviet Union represented by Russia
and Ukraine since FY'96) represent about 74 percent of all immigrant settlement and
adjustment in Louisiana during this seven-year period.<center>

<b>INS ESTIMATE OF ALIENS ELIGIBLE FOR CITIZENSHIP</b><br>
The INS estimates that as of April 1996 there were about 47,000 legal resident aliens in
Louisiana -- legal immigrants who had not yet become U.S. citizens -- of whom
27,000 had met the residency requirement to apply for citizenship.  Included in this number
could be aliens who had already applied for naturalization and were in the processing waiting
list.  The INS offices that handle naturalization cases and fingerprinting are located
at: <br><center>INS NEW ORLEANS<br>

<b>METROPOLITAN AREA DATA - <a
href="msas/042labat.htm">BATON ROUGE</a></b><p>

In 1990, 53,200 of Louisiana's immigrants lived in the New Orleans metropolitan area.  That
constituted over 60% of the state's total foreign born.  This is double the 30% share for its total
population compared to the state's total population. In the New Orleans metropolitan area
immigrants were 4.1% of the population.  The second largest concentration was in the Baton
Rouge metropolitan area, where the foreign born numbered about 10,600 and a 2% share of the
population. <p>

<b>ILLEGAL RESIDENT ALIENS </b><br>
The INS currently estimates the resident illegal alien population of Louisiana to be about 22,000
as of October 1996.  This is up from the 18,000 that the INS estimated the illegal alien
population to be in October 1992.  The new estimate is the 21st highest number of illegal aliens
in the United states. <p>
