An advantage that we have in influencing national politics is the number of activists who support
immigration reform, and the fact that they are spread accross the country.  Special interest
groups, by contrast, generally respond to a narrow, but economically powerful constituency.  The
effects of big money can be offset -- sometimes more than offset -- by the sheer number of
people who are expressing their views on an issue before the nation's decision makers.<p>

FAIR plays a preeminent role in mobilizing action on legislative proposals and other policy
processes by alerting its members about what is happening and advising what members can do to
register their views on a timely basis.  Activists are kept informed of time-sensitive
immigration-related developments by FAX, E-mail, phone or mail, depending on their capability
and preference.  The system is called the Immigration Legislative Network (ILN).<p>

<b>SIGN UP FOR ACTION ALERT MESSAGES</b><br>
To become included as a member of the ILN, please send an E-mail message to either FAIR's
Eastern or Western Regonal Coordinator (listed below).  They would like to have your name, E-
mail address, telephone number and address (FAX too if you have that capability).  You may be
sure that we will try to limit our requests to you to those of major importance.<p>      

As a member of FAIR's ILN, you will receive monthly legislative updates detailing immigration-
related congressional hearings, new legislation, and co-sponsors of critical bills.  You will also
be sent timely action alerts.<p>

We hope that you will join our efforts to influence the nation's immigration policies and, thereby,
to shape our country's future.<hr>

<b><center>FAIR REGIONAL COORDINATORS</b></center>
E-mail connections are provided below for FAIR's Eastern and Western Regional Coordinators. 
Depending on which side of the Mississippi you live on, please send a request to the appropriate
coordinator for inclusion on the ILN information system so that you can
more effectively influence your representatives and other key decision makers.<p>
