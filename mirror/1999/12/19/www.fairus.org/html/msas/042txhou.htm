<B>INS DATA ON NEW LEGAL IMMIGRANTS 1991-1998</B><br>
The Houston MSA is the sixth greatest magnet in the country for new immigrants (after LA and
NYC, Chicago, Miami, and Orange County).  The Houston PMSA (Chambers, Fort Bend, Harris,
Liberty, Montgomery and Waller Counties) accounted for the largest number of Texas' legal
immigrant settlement recorded by the INS since the 1990 Census. The average annual number of immigrant settlement in Houston has been over 23,000. <p>

The legal immigrant settlement data during this period was influenced by adjustment of status of a large number of
immigrants who had been in illegal status until the amnesty that was adopted in the 1986
Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA). This IRCA adjustment data -- which was still at
the surge level in FY-91, affected immigrant settlement data in the Houston metro area, with an
extra about 25,000 legalizations (mostly Mexicans).  
Just among the long-term resident amnesty applicants (excluding the amnestied agricultural workers), the number of applicants from the Houston metro area numbered 99,592. 
The data for FY'95, FY'97 and FY'98 were artificially low because the INS was not able to issue
green cards to all the applicants for adjustment of status who were already in the United States. 
In those three years, new immigration could have registered as much as 30 percent higher, if the
INS had issued more green cards.<p>

<B>ANNUAL TOTAL IMMIGRATION BY FISCAL YEAR: 1991-98</B><BR>
Listed below are the overall total legal immigrant admissions and adjustments for each of the eight
years since the 1990 Census. Also available is the year-by-year breakdown of the major
nationalities of the new immigrants and the cumulitive nationality data for FY'91-'96.

The following data are furnished for nationals of the countries with the largest number of
immigrants admitted or adjusted to legal U.S. residence in the Houston metro area.  
The absence of data for a country simply means that the total number of admissions
to the United States by nationals of that country were not enough to merit detailed reporting.<PRE>

<b> 1997 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS) DATA </b><br>
According to the 1997 CPS, Houston's metropolitan area population increased by over half a
million (16%) since
1990.  This was due to the natural increase (births-deaths) and the continuing influx of new
immigrants (31.5% of the increase), as well as a slight net in-migration of residents from
elsewhere.<p>

<center><tr><td width=500><img src="msasimg/txhounet.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><br>

<FONT SIZE=-1>The net international migration data understate the impact of immigration on a
locality because they record only the arrival of immigrants from abroad -- not those moving
within the country, and the children born to immigrants after their arrival are not part of the
immigrant settlement data -- they become part of domestic population change.</font><p>

<a name="105"><b>THE IMMIGRANT STOCK</b><br>
In Houston, 1.2 million residents are immigrant stock.  That represents almost 29 percent of the population.  
The immigrant stock is a term that refers to first generation immigrants, the "1.5 generation" 
(children of immigrants who are born abroad), and the second generation (the native-born Americans whose parents immigrated).
This information is reported by Ruben Rumbaut, a Michigan State U. professor and project leader analyzing the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study.<br>
