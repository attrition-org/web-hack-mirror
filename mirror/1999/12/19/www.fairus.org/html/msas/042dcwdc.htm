<B>INS DATA ON NEW LEGAL IMMIGRANTS 1991-1998</B><br>
The Washington DC metropolitan area (the District of Columbia, 5 surrounding Maryland counties, 11
Virginia counties, 6 independent Virginia cities and 2 West Virginia counties) accounts for
more than seven times the immigrant settlement rate in the District of Columbia.   The annual average number of immigrants settling in the area since 1990 
has been about 29,000.<p>

The legal immigrant settlement data during this period was augmented by adjustment of status of about 10,000 persons in FY-91
who had been in illegal status until the amnesty that was adopted in the 1986 Immigration
Reform and Control Act (IRCA).  
Just among the long-term resident amnesty applicants (excluding the amnestied agricultural workers), the number of applicants from the Washington, D.C. metro area numbered 19,804.<p> 
The data for FY'95, FY'97 and FY'98 were artificially low because the INS was not able to issue
green cards to all the applicants for adjustment of status who were already in the United States. 
In those three years, new immigration could have registered as much as 30 percent higher, if the
INS had issued more green cards.  First listed below are the overall total legal immigrant admissions
and adjustments for each of the eight years since the 1990 Census. That data
is followed by a year-by-year breakdown showing the major country of origin
data for the new immigrants.<p>

The following data are furnished for nationals of the countries with the largest number of
immigrants admitted or adjusted to legal U.S. residence each year. The absence of data for a country 
simply means that the total number of admissions
to the United States by nationals of that country were not enough to merit detailed reporting by

<b> 1997 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS) DATA </b><br>
According to the 1997 CPS, Washington DC's metropolitan area population increased by over
380,000 (9.0%) since
1990.  Of that increase, over 172,000 was due to net immigrant settlement (45% of the increase). 
This share of population increase does not take into concideration the share of population increase from children of immigrants born in this country --
who are counted with native-born births.
Applying national-level data that show about 21 percent of the country's net increase from natural change results from immigrant births, the total amount of population change in the Washington metro area due to immigration is likely to be about 62 percent. 

The Washington DC metro area, like the District, has a net 
out-migration of residents that offsets some of the natural increase (births-deaths).
 The outflow of native residents to other areas is not just a flight from the District, as the metro area has a greater outflow than District alone.  
<p>

<FONT SIZE=-1>The net international migration data understate the impact of immigration on a
locality because they record only the arrival of immigrants from abroad -- not those moving
within the country, and the children born to immigrants after their arrival are not part of the
immigrant settlement data -- they become part of domestic population change.</font><p>

<b>OTHER</b><br>
<a name="1206">The illegal immigrant flow from Chirilagua, a small town in southeastern El Salvador, to Arlandria, VA (now also called Chirilagua by its 80 percent majority Hispanic population) 
was profiled in the <i>Washington Post.</i>   This flow from Central America to the nation's capital region is a large part of the biggest wave of immigration in the area's history.  
From 1-in-22 residents being foreign born in 1970, the ratio jumped to 1-in-12 in 1980 and 1-in-6 today.  
The mass Chirilagua migration apparently began in the 1960's, but was fueled in the 1970's by the country's revolutionary insurgency and repression.  <p>

The <i>Post</i> article chronicals the migration of one family, starting with the father in the early 1970's to a job in construction.  
The mother followed a few years later.  The oldest of four children followed in 1980 at age 16, and she joined her mother working as a housekeeper at a Sheraton Hotel.
Within another year a grandmother and the other three children arrived.  The family connection continued to swell to include aunts and uncles and cousins -- and eventually entire neighborhoods.  
It is estimated that more than one million Salvadorans migrated during this period.  <p>

In the decade between the 1980 and 1990 Censuses (which significantly undercount illegal aliens) the population in just Maryland, Virginia and California -- the three major settlement locations -- jumped nearly four-fold from 84.6 thousand to 316.5 thousand.  

[FAIR Note: But the illegal migrant flow did not stop when the fighting in El Salvador ended.  
And the Central Americans, who had been spared from deportation during the fighting by temporary protected status (TPS), did not, for the most part, return home when that status expired.  
By 1996 the Census Bureau estimated that the Salvadoran population in those three states has grown by another 53 percent, to 485,000.]
