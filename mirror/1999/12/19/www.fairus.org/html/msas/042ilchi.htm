<B>INS DATA ON NEW LEGAL IMMIGRANTS 1991-1998</B><br>
The Chicago PMSA (Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will  
Counties) accounted for nine-tenths of Illinois' legal immigrant settlement recorded by
the INS since the 1990 Census. The legal immigrant settlement
data during this period was influenced by adjustment of status of a large number of immigrants
who had been in illegal status until the amnesty that was adopted in the 1986 Immigration
Reform and Control Act (IRCA). This IRCA adjustment data -- which was still at the surge level
in FY-91, affected adjustments in the Chicago metro area, with over 20,000 
Mexican legalizations accounting for most of them.  
Just among the long-term resident amnesty applicants (excluding the amnestied agricultural workers), the number of applicants from the Chicago metro area numbered 100,939. 
The data for FY'95, FY'97 and FY'98 were artificially low because the INS was not able to issue
green cards to all the applicants for adjustment of status who were already in the United States. 
In those three years, new immigration could have registered as much as 30 percent higher, if the
INS had issued more visas.<p>

The Chicago metropolitan area (MSA)
remains the third greatest magnet in the country for new immigrants (after LA and NY).  The
average number of new settlers to the area is about 37,000, discounting the effects of the
1986 amnesty.  In FY'98 the number of immigrants identifying the Chicago MSA as their
destination was just over 30,000.<p>

<B>ANNUAL TOTAL IMMIGRATION BY FISCAL YEAR</B><BR>
Listed below are the overall total legal immigrant admissions and adjustments for each of the first six
years since the 1990 Census. Also available is the year-by-year breakdown of the major
nationalities of the new immigrants.

The following data are furnished for nationals of the countries with the largest number of
immigrants admitted or adjusted to legal U.S. residence each year. The absence of data for a country 
simply means that the total number of admissions
to the United States by nationals of that country were not enough to merit detailed reporting by
MSA or PMSA jurisdiction.<PRE>

<b> 1997 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS) DATA </b><br>
According to the 1997 CPS, Chicago's metropolitan area population increased by over
360,000 (5.0%) since
1990.  Of that increase, 255,000 was due to net immigrant settlement.  There was also a net out-
migration of residents elsewhere that was almost as great as the natural increase (births-deaths).
As a result, over 70 percent of
Chicago's  population increase was due to immigrant settlement. <p>

<FONT SIZE=-1>The net international migration data understate the impact of immigration on a
locality because they record only the arrival of immigrants from abroad -- not those moving
within the country, and the children born to immigrants after their arrival are not part of the
immigrant settlement data -- they become part of domestic population change.</font><p>

<a name="113"><b>NATURALIZATION OF IMMIGRANTS</b><br>
In FY'99 the number of immigrants in Chicago who were naturalized as U.S. citizens was 40,358 -- the second highest number ever, after 51,200 in FY'96.  
However, the INS says that those who became citizens represented less than 80 percent of the applicants, with most of the remainder unable to pass the English or civics tests.
