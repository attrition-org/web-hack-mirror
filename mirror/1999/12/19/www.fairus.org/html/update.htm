						<h2><center>LEGISLATIVE UPDATE</center></h2>
<p>
(November 26, 1999)<p>

<b><font size="+1">Immigration reformers triumph in final budget bill</font></b>
<p>
Your months of hard work have helped stop this year's assaults on the 1996 immigration law and prevent a massive new illegal alien amnesty from being included in the final budget bill (H.R. 3194) Congress passed last week.  The bill did not contain an illegal alien amnesty, excluded a foreign worker (H-1B) visa increase, and protected the Section 110 entry-exit system.  Although we prevailed this year, make sure you keep those letters, calls, faxes, and e-mails flowing to Congress because our opponents will try again next year.
<p>
The following issues were decided in our favor this year:
<p>
<center><u>NO illegal alien amnesty!</u></center>
<p>
Reports recently surfaced that the Administration was demanding an amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens from Central America as part of the final budget deal.  However, calls, faxes, and e-mails from activists helped mobilize congressional opposition to the amnesty.  Consequently, the bill did not include an illegal alien amnesty.    
<p>
<center><u>Section 110 entry-exit system protected!</u></center>
<p>
Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI) failed to repeal or weaken the Section 110 entry-exit system that would stop drug traffickers, foreign terrorists, and illegal aliens from entering the United States and causing harm.  Although he amended the Senate INS and State Department bills, your months of continuous calls, letters, faxes, and e-mails solidified opposition to that plan and prevented Senator Abraham from including those provisions in the final budget bill.
<p>
<center><u>NO foreign worker (H-1B) increase!</u></center>
<p>
Despite intense pressure from special interest lobbyists and pro-immigration interests, the final budget bill did not increase the current limit on H-1B foreign worker visas.  These visas allow foreign workers to enter the U.S. and take some of America's best paying jobs.   
<p>
<center><u>Support for citizen child bill grows!</u></center>
<p>
Two more members of Congress, Representatives Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Zach Wamp (R-TN), have added their names to the growing list of lawmakers (36) who support H.R. 73, the Citizenship Reform Act. Congressman Brian Bilbray (R-CA) introduced the bill to close the loophole that encourages illegal immigration by awarding citizenship to the children of illegal aliens.  
<p>

Congress has adjourned for the year and is scheduled to reconvene on January 24, 2000.  In the meantime, we will provide updates as warranted.  For other immigration news and information,
