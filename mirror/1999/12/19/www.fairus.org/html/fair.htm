 The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) is a national, nonprofit, public-

interest organization of concerned citizens who share a common belief that our nation's 

immigration policies must be reformed to serve the national interest.<p>



Today the United States is receiving more immigrants than at any time in our history.  

Immigration has become an important issue because it affects virtually every aspect of life in

America.  With more than a million legal and illegal immigrants settling in the United States

each year, immigration has an impact on education, health care, government budgets,

employment, the environment, crime and countless  other areas of American life.  It is evident to

most Americans that large-scale immigration is not serving the needs and  interests of the

country.<p>



FAIR advocates a temporary moratorium on all immigration except spouses and minor children

of U.S. citizens and a limited number of refugees.  A moratorium would allow us to hold a

national debate and devise a comprehensive immigration reform strategy.  A workable 

immigration policy is one that would allow us time to regain control of our borders and reduce

overall levels of immigration to more traditional levels of about 300,000 a year.<p>



 FAIR believes America can and must have an immigration policy that is nondiscriminatory and

is designed to serve the social, economic and environmental needs of our country.  It is a policy

that all recent polls show has the overwhelming support of the American public.

<p>



Since it was founded in 1978, FAIR has been leading the call for immigration reform.  

Representatives of our organization are routinely interviewed by the major news networks, radio

talk shows and the print media about all aspects of the immigration debate.  FAIR is one of the

few reliable sources of information of this subject.  Our  research and publications are relied on

by academics and government officials involved in formulating immigration policy.  We testify

regularly before Congress on all immigration-related legislation.

<p>



With more than 70,000 members nationwide and headquarters in Washington, D.C., FAIR is a 

nonpartisan group whose membership runs the gamut from liberal to conservative.  We have a

Board of Directors and a National Advisory Board composed of distinguished citizens. <p>



We have a satellite office in Los Angeles and field representatives across the nation.  FAIR

activities include research, public education, media outreach, grassroots organizing, government

relations, litigation and advocacy at the national, state and local levels.<p>
