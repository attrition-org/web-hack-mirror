<h2><center>Immigrants and Education</h2><h3>Data from the U.S. Department of Education</h3></center>
<hr><p>
 
The following data are taken from <i><b>The Triennial Comprehensive Report on Immigration</b></i> 
submitted to Congress in 1999 by the U.S. Department of Justice/Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Department of Justice/Bureau of International Labor Affairs.  
The contribution of the U.S. Department of Education appears in Chapter 7 "Immigration and the U.S. Educational System."  <p>

The data refer to special programs primarily directed at students with English language educational needs (Limited English Proficiency - LEP).
Although these LEP programs are not confined to immigrants, most of the participants in the programs are immigrants 
or the children of immigrants.  It should be kept in mind that the $1.5 billion costs itmized below that are associated with these programs understate 
the educational cost outlays for immigrants and their children because they represent supplemental programs and do not include the expenditures for the general educational expenses of these students.   In addition some immigrants come from English-speaking
countries or have learned English on their own and need not participate in LEP programs, although they may 
be enrolled in other public-supported classes.<p>

<center><b>Major Programs that Served LEP Students in FY1995</b></center><p>
