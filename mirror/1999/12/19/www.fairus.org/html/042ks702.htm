<b> 1990 CENSUS DATA ON THE FOREIGN-BORN </b><br> 
Between 1980 and 1990, the overall population of Kansas grew by about 10% while its
foreign-born population grew by 31% -- to about 63,000.  The foreign born in Kansas
represented only 2.5% of the total population in 1990, but it accounted for 6.5% of the
population growth over the previous decade.  The largest population group in both 1980 and
1990 were those born in Mexico.  That nationality group accounted for over half of the
increase in the immigrant population between 1980 and 1990. <p>

INS data show that since 1990, Kansas has received an average of over 3,500 legal immigrants
per year through FY'95.  In FY'96, the number of immigrants indicating Kansas as their intended
residence was 4,303.  The major source country was Mexico, with 1,470 immigrants.  The
second largest number of new immigrants was from Vietnam (683).<p>

<b>THE IMMIGRANT STOCK</b><br>
There are about 262 thousand people in Kansas who may be considered "immgrant stock."
The immigrant stock is a term that refers to first generation immigrants, the "1.5 generation" 
(children of immigrants who are born abroad), and the second generation (the native-born Americans whose parents immigrated).<p>


<b> 1998 CPS DATA ON THE FOREIGN BORN </b><br>
In the most recent Census Bureau estimate, Kansas's overall population increased by about
34,000 (1.3%).  The 1998 CPS data, analyzed by the Center for Immigration Studies, showed
the immigrant population dropped slightly (7,000).  As a result of these two trends, the share of
the state's population comprised of immigrants dropped slightly to 3.8 percent.<br>
[FAIR Comment:  A declining foreign-born population is possible if a larger number of
immigrants moved elsewhere in the United States, returned abroad, or died than the number of
new arrivals.  However, the apparent drop may be simply due to sampling error].<p>

The Census Bureau calculates that since the 1990 Census the state's population has increased by
over 24,000 because of immigration, while over the same period the state's population has
decreased by about 13,000 due to the departure of established residents to other states in excess
of the arrival of migrants from other states.<p>

<b> 1997 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS) DATA </b><br>
The location with the largest number of new immigrants was Sedgwick County (Wichita)
with 4,700.  Johnson County (Kansas City) had an immigrant increase of 3,500 and three other
counties had increases of over 1,000 (Finney, Ford and Seward).  All of those counties, except
Johnson, had an outflow from domestic migration that exceeded the inflow from
immigration.<p>

<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/ks-net.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

<b>NET INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION</b><br>
The Census Bureau estimates that Kansas' population increased by 15,691 over the last
year (ending in July 1997).  Compared to that overall increase, net international migration
accounted for an estimated increase of 4,406.  Thus immigration accounted for over 28
percent of the state's population increase (that is slightly above the national median share of
population increase due to immigration).<p>

<b>METROPOLITAN AREA DATA - <a href="msas/042kskan.htm">KANSAS
CITY</a></b><p>

<b>POPULATION CHANGE 1900-2000</b><br>
It helps to have a clear perspective of the past population change that the state has experienced
when considering the role of immigration in Kansas's current and future population change. 
Over the past 50 years, the population of the state has increased by about half-again.  Although
most of recent population growth has come from natural change (births minus deaths), some has
come from net international migration as opposed to net domestic migration, which has been
negative.  <p>

<b>POPULATION PROJECTION</b><br>
The 1997 Census Bureau population projection has Kansas' population growing by 21%
between 1995 and 2025 (to 3,108,000).  That is also the national median rate of growth.<p>

The Census Bureau population projection noted above is the "middle" projection, and it assumes
immigration at a net annual increase of 820,000.  There are other projections based on different
assumptions.  In the Census Bureau's "high" immigration projection, assuming annual net
immigration of 1,370,000, the population in 2025 is more than six percent higher than in the
middle projection, and it is over 11 percent higher by 2050.  For Kansas, the high projection
could mean a population in 2050 of 5,100,000 to 5,500,000.  If immigration were
significantly scaled back, the population increase attributable to immigration and the
population spill-over effects from other states could be significantly reduced over time.  See <a
href="04109604.htm">Immigration and Population Growth</a></font><p>

<a name="1207"><b>INS DATA ON IMMIGRANT SETTLEMENT</b><br>
Immigrant settlement in Kansas has risen since 
the adoption of the current immigration system in 1965.  The average settlement recently is more than two-and-a-half times higher than it was in the late 1960s.<br>  
<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/ksins.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center>
<p>

 Legal immigrant settlement in Kansas since 1990 has averaged nearly 3,500 per
year.  The data for fiscal year (FY) 1991 were elevated by the inclusion of some of the former
illegal aliens who were amnestied in 1986.  
Just among the long-term resident amnesty applicants (excluding the amnestied agricultural workers), the number of applicants from Kansas was 3,571.   
The data for FY'95 and FY'97 were artificially low
because the INS was not able to issue green cards to all the applicants for adjustment of status
who were already in the United States.  In those two years, new immigration could have
registered as much as 30 percent higher, if the INS had issued more visas.<p><PRE>

<b>INS DATA BY NATIONALITY: FY'91-FY'97</b><BR>
The INS data below are the totals for the countries with the largest number of immigrants
admitted or adjusted to legal residence since 1990. The nationalities may change each year, so
the totals in some cases will not reflect all the immigrants of that nationality who have become
legal immigrants in Kansas during the seven-year period. For example, data on German admissions include only five of the 
seven years and for Bangladesh data are available for only three years. The 26 nationalities (Hong Kong
and Taiwan included with mainland Chinese, and the former Soviet Union represented by Russia
and Ukraine since FY'96) represent over 83 percent of all immigrant settlement and
adjustment in Kansas during this seven-year period.  Mexican immigrants accounted for more than one-third of all admissions during this period.<center>

<b>NATURALIZATION</b><br>
Foreign-born Kansas residents who identified themselves as U.S. citizens in the 1990 Census numbered 27,236 (43%) of the 62,840 foreign born.  
By April 1966, the share of Kansas' immigrant population that had become U.S. citizens was 35.5 percent -- about the
the national average.  The declining rate of naturalization likely reflects the rising number of new immigrants and illegal alien residents who are not eligible to apply for citizenship.<p>

The INS estimates that as of April 1996 there were about 36,000 legal non-U.S. citizen resident aliens in Kansas
of whom 22,000 had met the residency requirement to apply for citizenship. The INS office that handles naturalization cases and fingerprinting is located
at: <p>

<center>INS WICHITA<br>
626 N. WINTERSET<br>
WICHITA, KS 67212</center><p>

<b> ILLEGAL RESIDENT ALIENS </b><br>
The INS issued an estimate of the illegal resident alien population in 1997 that identified Kansas
as having about 20,000 as of October 1996.  This number of illegal aliens was one-third higher
than the 15,000 that the INS said were in the state in October 1992. <p>

In late July and August 1996 the INS and other agencies identified 76 illegal aliens working
in Kansas.  Nearly all of the aliens were from Mexico (97%) or Central America.  The
enforcement effort was conducted in 13 central states, and Kansas accounted for the ninth
largest number of the work site apprehensions after Texas, New Mexico, Minnesota, Iowa.
Wisconsin, Wyoming. Illinois and Oklahoma. <br>
<font size="-1"> (Source: INS News Release, September 5, 1996) </font><p>

According to Lynn Phetteplace, supervisory special agent for the INS office covering western
Kansas, "the per capita number of illegal aliens in southwest Kansas is probably as high as it is
anywhere in the United States, including California and Arizona.  Word gets out that jobs are
available in the beef-packing plants in the area and that the jobs pay pretty well, and people come
for the jobs." <br>
<font size="-1">(<i> Kansas City Star,</i> June 27, 1993) </font><p>

According to White House Drug Policy Director Barry McCaffrey, "Colorado, Utah and
Wyoming, the Rocky Mountain heartland of America, are increasingly becoming populated with
Mexican drug trafficking organizations and violent gangs using this major transportation
crossroads as a trans-shipment center."  But, according to anti-drug treatment workers, the drugs,
often methamphetamines, are not just passing through, they are increasingly being used by local
youth.  This summer a dozen people, nine of them illegal aliens from Mexico, were arrested in
Kansas City on trafficking cocaine and marijuana from the Mexican states of Zacatecas and
Chihuahua.<br>
<font size="-1"><i>Los Angeles Times,</i> Dec. 10, 1997</font><p>

On December 16, 1997, INS agents apprehended 24 illegal aliens working at a construction site
in
Witchita.  They were all Mexican adult males, and one minor.<br>

<b> OTHER</b><br>
Based on the research of Rice Univ. Economics Prof. Donald Rice, FAIR estimates the net cost
of Kansas's foreign-born population was over $154 million in 1995.  This estimate is based on
the public services they received and costs associated with their displacement of American
workers. <p>

The police chief of Garden City (Finney County) estimates that immigrants are responsible for
the 54% increase in violent crimes that occurred in the city between 1987 and 1992. <br>
