<b> 1990 CENSUS DATA ON IMMIGRANT SETTLEMENT </b><br>
In 1990, there were about 2,000 fewer foreign-born persons residing in Wyoming than ten years
earlier (from 9,607 to 7,647).  Thee overall population of the state also declined, by about 21,000 (from about 475,000 to 453,588).  The largest
foreign-born group in both 1980 and 1990 was from Mexico.  <p>

In 1990, slightly more than one-third of the state's foreign-born population had arrived since
1980.  Since 1990, INS data indicate that an average of about 300 new immigrants per year
have identified Wyoming as their intended residence.  In fiscal year 1996, the number was 280,
and the country of origin of the largest share (94) was Mexico.<p>

<a name="stock"><b>THE IMMIGRANT STOCK</b><br>
There were about 32 thousand people in Wyoming in 1997 who may be considered "immgrant stock."
The immigrant stock is a term that refers to first generation immigrants, the "1.5 generation" 
(children of immigrants who are born abroad), and the second generation (the native-born Americans whose parents immigrated).<p>


<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/wy-net.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

<a name="cps"><b> 1998 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS) DATA </b><br>
The Census Bureau's population estimate for Wyoming, based on 1988 CPS data, shows an
increase of only ablout 1,000 over a year earlier (to 481,000).  The CPS data, led the Center
for Immigration Studies to put the foreign-born population at 6,000 a decrease from a year
earlier.  (Comment:  The foreign-born share of the population is more subject to sampling error
in a state with a low share, like Wyoming.)  Since the 1990 Census, the Census Bureau estimates
that the state has increased in population by over 27,000.  Only slightly more than 2,000 of that
increase is attributed to net international migration.<p>

<b> 1997 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS) DATA </b><br>
In 1997, the share of Wyoming's foreign born population that had become naturalized as U.S.
citizens was about one third (36.1%). The two areas with the greatest net increase in new
immigrants since 1990 were the Cheyenne area (+292) and Laramie area (+222).<p>

<b>POPULATION CHANGE 1900-2000</b><br>
It helps to have a clear perspective of the past population change that the state has experienced
when considering the role of immigration in Wyoming's current and future population change. 
Over the past 50 years, the population of the state has increased by about tw0-thirds.  Most of
recent population growth has come from natural increase (births minus deaths), but international
and inter-state migration have also contributed. <p>

<a name="project"><b>POPULATION PROJECTION</b><br>
The 1997 Census Bureau population projection has Wyoming's population growing by 45%
between 1995 and 2025 (to 694,000).  That is the 11th fastest projected rate of growth in the
country.  <p>

The Census Bureau population projection noted above is the "middle" projection, and it assumes
immigration at a net annual increase of 820,000.  There are other projections based on different
assumptions.  In the Census Bureau's "high" immigration projection, assuming annual net
immigration of 1,370,000, the population in 2025 is more than six percent higher than in the
middle projection, and it is over 11 percent higher by 2050.  For Wyoming, the high projection
could mean a population in 2050 of 950,000 to 970,000.  If today's mass immigration were
significantly scaled back, the population increase attributable to immigration and the
population spill-over effects from other states could be significantly reduced over time.  See <a
href="../04109604.htm">Immigration and Population Growth</a></font><p>

<a name="1129"><a name="legal"><b>INS DATA ON IMMIGRANT SETTLEMENT</b><br>
Immigrant settlement in Wyoming has risen since 
the adoption of the current immigration system in 1965.  The recent rate of new immigrants is about fifty percent higher than the rate of the late 1960s.<p>

<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/wyins.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

 Legal immigrant settlement in Wyoming since 1990 has averaged more than 300 per year. 
The data for fiscal year (FY) '91 were artificially raised by the inclusion of some of the former
illegal aliens who were amnestied in 1986.  
Among the long-term resident amnesty applicants (excluding the amnestied agricultural workers), the number applying from Wyoming was 631.  
The data for FY'95 and FY'97 were artificially low
because the INS was not able to issue green cards to all the applicants for adjustment of status
who were already in the United States.  In those two years, new immigration could have
registered as much as 30 percent higher, if the INS had issued more visas.<p><PRE>

<b>INS DATA BY NATIONALITY: FY'91-FY'97</b><BR>
The INS data below are the totals for the countries with the largest number of immigrants
admitted or adjusted to legal residence since 1990. The nationalities may change each year, so
the totals in some cases will not reflect all the immigrants of that nationality who have become
legal immigrants in Wyoming during the seven-year period. Data on German admissions includes only five of the 
seven years and for Japan the admission data is available for only three years. The 16 nationalities (Hong Kong
and Taiwan included with mainland Chinese, and the former Soviet Union represented by Russia
and Ukraine since FY'96) represent over 78 percent of all immigrant settlement and
adjustment in Wyoming during this seven-year period.<center><PRE>

<a name="illegal"><b> ILLEGAL ALIENS </b><br>
The INS estimates the illegal alien population in Wyoming at 1,700, a 21% increase over its
previous estimate (October 1992).   This level of illegal resident aliens suggests that more than
one in five among the foreign-born population is in the U.S. in violation of our immigration law.

In late July and August 1996 the INS and other agencies identified 120 illegal aliens working
in Wyoming.  Nearly all of the aliens were from Mexico (97%) or Central America.  The
enforcement effort was conducted in 13 central states, and Wyoming accounted for the sixth
largest number of the work site apprehensions after Texas, New Mexico, Minnesota, Iowa and
Wisconsin. <br>
<font size="-1"> (Source: INS News Release, September 5, 1996) </font><p>

According to the state Department of Criminal Investigation in Cheyenne, Wyoming has seen a
serious influx of both illegal immigrants and smuggled drugs.  DCI Director Tom Pagel states, 
"The vast majority of this is being transported up from Mexico, and we're getting our butts
kicked over it."  According to White House Drug Policy Director Barry McCaffrey, "Colorado,
Utah and Wyoming, the Rocky Mountain heartland of America, are increasingly becoming
populated with Mexican drug trafficking organizations and violent gangs using this major
transportation crossroads as a trans-shipment center."  But, according to anti-drug treatment
workers, the drugs, often methamphetamine, are not just passing through, they are increasingly
being used by local youth.<br>
<font size="-1"><i>Los Angeles Times,</i> Dec. 10, 1997</font><p>

Last spring 18 members of a drug ring run by a Mexican national were successfully prosecuted. 
the leader had been previously convicted twice in Colorado on drug charges, and had been
deported each time.  In October, police chalked up 18 arrests on drug, illegal immigrant and
firearms charges , thirteen of the suspects being Mexican nationals.<br>
