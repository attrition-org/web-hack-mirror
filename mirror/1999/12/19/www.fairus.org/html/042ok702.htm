<b> 1990 CENSUS DATA ON THE FOREIGN-BORN </b><br>
Between 1980 and 1990 Oklahoma's overall population grew by about 3.5 percent while its
foreign-born population grew by over 16 percent.  The 65,000 foreign born, who accounted for
about two percent of Oklahoma's population in 1990, accounted for 8.6 percent of the state's
population growth during the previous decade. <p>

A more than doubling of Oklahoma's Mexican-born population accounted for most of the state's
immigrant growth during the 1980s.  The number of residents born in Germany, which was
the largest foreign national group in 1980, declined and moved to third place behind Mexico and
Vietnam <p>

The metropolitan area with the highest concentration of immigrants was Lawton, with its over
5,000 foreign-born accounting for over 5% of its population.  <p>

<b>THE IMMIGRANT STOCK</b><br>
There were about 190 thousand people in Oklahoma in 1997 who may be considered "immgrant stock."
The immigrant stock is a term that refers to first generation immigrants, the "1.5 generation" 
(children of immigrants who are born abroad), and the second generation (the native-born Americans whose parents immigrated).<p>

<b> 1998 CPS DATA ON THE FOREIGN BORN </b><br>
In the most recent Census Bureau estimate, Oklahoma's overall population increased by about
70,000 over the previous year.  The 1998 CPS data, analyzed by the Center for Immigration
Studies, showed the immigrant population dropped by 1,000.  (FAIR Comment:  It seems
unlikely the foreign-born population dropped unless there was a significant re-migration of
immigrants to other states.  It seems more likely that there was some sampling error.) As a result
of these two trends, the share of the state's population comprised of immigrants remained
unchanged at two percent.<br>

The Census Bureau calculates that since the 1990 Census the state's population has increased by
over 26,000 because of immigration, more than half of the amount of increase from  net domestic
increase of about 48,000.<p>

<b> 1997 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS) DATA </b><br>
 Over three-fifths of the state's immigrant increase since 1990 was located in the Oklahoma City
(40%) and Tulsa (21%) metropolitan areas.  <p>

Oklahoma's immigrant population is about one-third naturalized U.S. citizens.  This is about the
national average.<p>

<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/ok-net.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

<b>NET INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION</b><br>
The Census Bureau estimates that Oklahoma's population increased by 21,776 over the last
year (ending in July 1997).  Compared to that overall increase, net international migration
accounted for an estimated increase of 3,147.  Thus Oklahoma's rising immigrant share
accounted for about 15 percent of its population growth.  This amount of immigration-caused
increase is below the national average.<p>

<b>POPULATION CHANGE 1900-2000</b><br>
It helps to have a clear perspective of the past population change that the state has experienced
when considering the role of immigration in Oklahoma's current and future population change. 
Over the past 50 years, the population of the state has increased by about one million, nearly half
again.  Although most of recent population growth has come natural increase (births minus
deaths), both net international and inter-state migration have played a major role, and immigrants
have also added to the birth rates fuelling natural increase. <p>

<b>POPULATION PROJECTION</b><br>
The 1997 Census Bureau population projection has Oklahoma's population growing by 24%
between 1995 and 2025 (to 4,057,000).  That is the 23rd fastest projected rate of growth in the
country.  The rate of increase in the foreign-born population between 1980 and 1990 was
even higher than the projected rate, and it is clear that the projection contemplates continued
high-volume immigrant settlement in the state.<p>

The Census Bureau population projection noted above is the "middle" projection, and it assumes
immigration at a net annual increase of 820,000.  There are other projections based on different
assumptions.  In the Census Bureau's "high" immigration projection, assuming annual net
immigration of 1,370,000, the population in 2025 is more than six percent higher than in the
middle projection, and it is over 11 percent higher by 2050.  For Oklahoma, the high projection
could mean a population in 2050 of 4,800,000 to 5,250,000.  If today's mass immigration were
significantly scaled back, the population increase attributable to immigration and the
population spill-over effects from other states could be significantly reduced over time.  See <a

<a name="1207"><b>INS DATA ON IMMIGRANT SETTLEMENT</b><br>
Immigrant settlement in Oklahoma has risen since 
the adoption of the current immigration system in 1965.  The recent rate of new immigrants is more than three times the rate of the late 1960s.<p>
<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/okins.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

Legal immigrant settlement in Oklahoma since 1990 has averaged over 3,500 per year.  The data
for fiscal year (FY) 1991 were artificially raised by the inclusion of some of the former illegal
aliens who were amnestied in 1986.  
Just among the long-term resident amnesty applicants (excluding the amnestied agricultural workers), the number applying from Oklahoma was 6,517.  

The data for FY'95 and FY'97 were artificially low because
the INS was not able to issue green cards to all the applicants for adjustment of status who
were already in the United States.  In those two years, new immigration could have registered
as much as 30 percent higher, if the INS had issued more visas.<p><PRE>

<P><STRONG>INS DATA BY NATIONALITY: FY'91-FY'97</STRONG><BR>
The INS data below are the totals for the countries with the largest number of immigrants
admitted or adjusted to legal residence since 1990. The nationalities may change each year, so
the totals in some cases will not reflect all the immigrants of that nationality who have become
legal immigrants in Oklahoma during the seven-year period.  For example, data on Hondurans, 
and Yugoslavians are included for only three of the seven years. <p>

The 26 nationalities (Hong Kong and Taiwan included with mainland Chinese, and the former
Soviet Union represented by Russia and Ukraine since FY'96) constitute about seven-eighths
(83%) of all immigrant settlement and adjustment in Oklahoma during this seven-year period. 
The major source country is Mexico with over one-third of the total. <center>

<b> ILLEGAL RESIDENT ALIENS </b><br>
The INS estimates that in October 1996 the resident illegal alien population in Oklahoma had
reached 21,000 from an estimated 17,000 four years earlier.  Thus it is possible that one in every
three immigrants is illegally in the country.

In late July and August 1996 the INS and other agencies identified 103 illegal aliens working
in Oklahoma.  Nearly all of the aliens were from Mexico (97%) or Central America.  The
enforcement effort was conducted in 13 central states, and Oklahoma accounted for the eighth
largest number of the work site apprehensions after Texas, New Mexico, Minnesota, Iowa,
Wisconsin, Wyoming and Illinois. <br>

Juan Adame Sainz, 40, a labor contractor, faces up to 15 months in prison when he is sentenced
Tuesday for smuggling undocumented workers from Mexico to pick corn on the Western Slope.
During the corn harvest, Adames supplied nearly 100 farm workers.  Federal immigration
authorities called the sentencing of their biggest case against a Colorado employer for hiring
illegal workers. In the past they had been stumped because they could arrest only smugglers or
motorists transporting illegal workers, but this is one of the first times agents have gone up the
chain.  "It's one of our first efforts where we have linked smuggling to an employer," said Troy
Henley, supervisory special agent for the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
anti-smuggling unit in Colorado.<br>
