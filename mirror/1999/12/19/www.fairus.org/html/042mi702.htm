<a name="general"></a><b>GENERAL INFORMATION</b><br>
According to the 1990 Census, about 7% of Michigan's population speaks a language other than
English at home.<p>

<a name="118">The estimated 45,000 children of immigrants in the Detroit metro area schools -- two-thirds of whom need English language assistance -- have the effect of pulling down the schools on standardized tests where they are enrolled.  
These students are especially concentrated in Hamtramck and Dearborn.  
Students who are learning English are exempted from participating in standardized tests for two years.  
But school officials say that even after two years of instruction, the students may still have problems in English.  
When the school ends up with a low score on a standardized test, the entire school ends up suffering from a bad reputation.

Based on the research of Rice Univ. Economics Prof. Donald Rice, FAIR estimates the net cost
of Michigan's foreign-born population was over $1 billion in 1995.  This estimate is based on the
public services they received and costs associated with their displacement of American workers.
<p>

After Detroit, the metropolitan area with the second highest concentration of foreign-born
persons was Ann Arbor.  The 23,000 immigrants living there in 1990 represented a 4.8%
population share. <p>

The Grand Rapids-Muskegon-Holland metropolitan area was rated by ReliaStar Financial Corp.
in 1998 as the No. 3 city in the US (out of 100) "to Earn and Save Money."  The Kalamazoo-
Battle creek area was ranked No. 26.  Our analysis of the ReliaStar ratings shows that the highest
ranked cities have slower growing immigrant populations than the lowest ranked cities.  The
Grand Rapids area had a 2.8 percent foreign-born share in 1990 (compared to the national
average of 7.9%) and 5.9 percent of its nearly 117,000 population increase (1990-97) was due to
net international immigration (compared to the national average of 30%).  The Kalamazoo area
had a 2.6 percent foreign-born share in 1990 and 3.8 percent of the 1990-97 population
increase of 46,000 was due to net international migration.  For further details, see <a
href="07240805.htm">Cities Index</a><p>

<a name="students"></a><b>FOREIGN STUDENTS</b><br>
The 1997/98 annual report of the Institute of International Education shows a 5.1% increase in
foreign students attending U.S. colleges and universities (481,280) over a year earlier.  Michigan
had the eighth greatest number in the country -- 17,878 (3.7% of the total).  Two Michigan
schools were among the top 25 in the country for highest number of foreign students:  univ.
Michigan-Ann Arbor - 3,368 and Michigan Univ.-East Lansing - 2,823.<p>

<a name="illegal"></a><b> ILLEGAL RESIDENT ALIENS </b> <br>
The INS estimates that in October 1996 the resident illegal alien population in Michigan was
37,000.  This is an increase by about one-third from its estimate of about 28,000 illegal aliens in
October 1992. <p>

At least four INS workplace raids have been conducted in the Detroit area in late 1998, including
one at a Thorn Apple Valley plant on the east side that resulted in 80 arrests of illegal aliens. 
The Detroit Hispanic Civil Rights Council sponsored a protest march in mid-November. <br>
