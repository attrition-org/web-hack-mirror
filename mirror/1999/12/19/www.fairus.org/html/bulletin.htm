<b>FROM OUR WEB SITE USERS</b><p><ul>
<b>COMMENTARY ON THE H-1B "TEMPORARY" HIGH-TECH WORKER
PROGRAM</b><br>
"Employers are trying to solve their problems with legislation instead of using fair business
practices, namely supply and demand. In the 80's the supply of programmers was high and wages
were low. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, business is crying. Supply and demand is as
American as apple pie. Don't let the limit be raised. Software developers a.k.a programmers are
just now starting to make a fair wage. Did you know that most programmers work 60 or 
more hours a week for 40 hours worth of pay? Did you know that most companies
internal policies are to hire one programmer for every two persons worth of work? ... <br>
Do we want our technology held hostage by nationals of another country? Our nuclear
technology is a good example of a bad technology transfer. How do companies do a background
check on an H-1B employee anyway? What part of the software community will it be safe for
them to work? What sensitive material will they get to look at and send back home? Are there
American security interests at stake in increasing H-1B? ... <br>
If American employees do not have time for their children because they work multiple jobs
because business keeps legislating their supply of employees then where does business think the
next generation of good employees will come from? They will come from overseas!!! 
Companies will be able to hire the cream and fire the rest. They will use up the best and the
brightest with no regard to investing in our country. How are families to function...? When
companies try to legislate salaries, both parents find themselves scrambling to find work outside
the home to make ends meet.<br>

<b>REINFORCING THE BORDER</b><br>
Since January of this year, The Tucson Sector of the U.S. Border Patrol has apprehended
approximately 250,000 illegal aliens sneaking across Arizona's border with Mexico.  According
to the lowest INS estimate, for every apprehension, three illegal aliens escape.   (Although
previous estimates of the ratio has been 5 to 1, let's go with the 3 to 1 ratio.)   Let's further
assume that those apprehended and deported have returned to their country of origin to stay.  
This means that a minimum of 750,000 illegal aliens have successfully entered this country
across Arizona's borders this year alone.  The vast majority of those successful entries have taken
place in and around the Douglas area.  Let's further assume that only 1 percent of those
successful entrants are persons having criminal tendencies.  That means 7,500 vandals, burglars,
car thieves, mail pilferers and criminal trespassers have entered Arizona this year alone. ...<br>
The fault of this whole situation lies with multinational corporations who further victimize cheap
laborers with low wages; the foreign governments who would rather push their citizens to the
United States other than risk the wrath of the elite in their homeland by instituting economic
reforms; and the United States politicians who refuse to risk losing money flowing to their
campaigns and political parties. ...<br>
