<a name="hr1841">H.R. 1841</a> - Rep. Gutierrez (D-IL)<br>
41 cosponsors<p>

1) Restores the Section 245(i) program which allows an illegal alien to pay a $1,000 fine to adjust his or her status, enabling the alien to remain in the country and avoid reentry bars.  
<p>
Status:  Referred to the House Immigration Subcommittee.  
<p>
FAIR comment: Provides an easy method for illegal aliens and potential foreign terrorists to remain in the country despite laws requiring their removal and bars to reentry.  H.R. 1841 is one of the bills included in NIF's "Fix 96" campaign, an effort to rollback many of the important immigration reforms Congress made in 1996.
