<h2><center>Insist on Respect for our Laws - Reject INA Sect. 245(i)!</h2></center><hr>

<font size="-1">The letter below summarizes why legislation <a href="wrapup.htm#hr1841">(H.R.1841)</a> to restore a provision (Section 245(i)) that allows illegal aliens to become legal residents without leaving the country would be a serious mistake.  
If you agree, please tell your representatives.  [For us to FAX or e-mail
your message for you, tell us at <a href="mailto:letters@fairus.org">letters@fairus.org</a>
and give us your name and return address and your representative's name so he or she will know the message comes from a constituent and how to reply to you.]</font> <hr><p>

The Honorable ___________________(two Senators from your state) <br>
U.S. Senate <br>
Washington, DC 20510 <br>

<b><center> and Representative </b></center><br>

The Honorable ____________________<br>
U.S. House of Representatives <br>
Washington, DC 20515 <p>

Dear __________:  <P>

Please oppose H.R.1841 and all other efforts to restore a loophole - INA Section 245(i) -  that would allow aliens to become legal residents while living here illegally. 
That provision was ended by the last Congress because it encouraged disregard for our immigration laws. <p>

How can we expect immigrants to understand that our country is built on respect for the law if we ignore their law-breaking in their effort to to join us? <p>

In 1996 Congress wisely decided that illegal aliens should pay a penalty for violating our immigration law: a waiting period of several years outside the United States before the alien can return for legal residence.
That penalty is enforced at present when an illegal alien has to return home to obtain a visa. 
Restoring Section 245(i) would invalidate the penalty by allowing the illegal alien to convert to legal status without ever having to leave the country.
<p>

We must stop illegal immigration because it hurts America's poorest citizens by competing for a dwindling number of low-skill jobs.  
Other social consequences include fiscal burdens on local communities, social tension and criminal activity. 
It may be tempting to be warm-hearted towards poor aliens seeking a better life in this country, but our own poor should have our first priority. 
If we are ever going to reduce the flood of illegal immigration, we must stick to a cool-headed policy of insisting that our immigration laws be respected.<p>

The proponants of H.R.1841 try to disguise the fact that they are trying to benefit illegal aliens by describing them as aliens eligible to become legal residents.  
This in no way diminishes the fact that the intended benficiaries are illegal aliens, and many of them may be found ineligible.
In light of INS failure to screen out citizenship applicants with criminal records, it is unwise to rely on them to uncover an alien's criminal or terrorist activities abroad. 
It is obviously far better to have ineligible applicants back in their home country when denied a visa than still in the U.S. where the INS deportation system has broken down. <p>
