<b> CENSUS DATA ON THE FOREIGN BORN </b><br>
Between the 1980 and 1990 Censuses, the population of Nevada grew by 48.9 percent.  The
state's foreign-born population grew by 94.9 percent during that same period and accounted for
12.9% of the state's overall population growth. <p>

Persons born in Mexico accounted for 31% of the state's 1990 foreign born.  That
nationality group had nearly quadrupled from the 1980 Census.  The 2nd largest
nationality group -- the Philippines -- had grown by over three times its size
in the 1980 Census. <p>

Over two-thirds of Nevada's 1990 total foreign-born population (104,828) lived in just one of its
16 counties -- Clark County hosts 67.1% (70,333).  The state's overall foreign-born percentage
was 8.7%.  Clark County's foreign-born share was 9.5%. In the rest of the state, the foreign-born
share averaged 7.5%. <p>

The Las Vegas metropolitan area, of which Clark County is the largest part, had a foreign born
population in 1990 of about 74,000.  The share of its population that was foreign born was 8.7%. 
The Reno metropolitan area had a higher foreign-born population share (9.2%) with about
23,400 immigrants. <p>

<b>THE IMMIGRANT STOCK</b><br>
There were about 395 thousand people in Nevada in 1997 who may be considered "immgrant stock."
The immigrant stock is a term that refers to first generation immigrants, the "1.5 generation" 
(children of immigrants who are born abroad), and the second generation (the native-born Americans whose parents immigrated).<p>

<b> 1998 CPS DATA ON THE FOREIGN BORN </b><br>
In the most recent Census Bureau estimate, Nevada's overall population increased by about
70,000.  The 1998 CPS data, analyzed by the Center for Immigration Studies, showed
the immigrant population increased by 14,000.  As a result of these two trends, the share of the
state's population comprised of immigrants rose slightly to 11.2 percent (the 9th highest rate in
the country).<br>

The Census Bureau calculates that since the 1990 Census the state's population has increased by
over 45,369 because of immigration, about half of the amount of increase from the natural rate of
births less deaths, but much smaller than the net domestic increase of just under 400,000.<p>

<b> 1997 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS) DATA </b><br>
Among Nevada's foreign born, less than one-in-three (28.5%) were naturalized U.S. citizens.
 About 65 percent of the new immigrants located in Clark County (Las Vegas) and another 25
percent located in Washoe County (Reno).<p>

<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/nv-net.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

<b>NET INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION</b><br>
The Census Bureau estimates that Nevada's population increased by 75,999 over the last
year (ending in July 1997).  Compared to that overall increase, net international migration
accounted for an estimated increase of 5,855.  Thus immigration accounted for nearly eight
percent of the state's population increase (that is about one-third of the national median share of
population increase due to immigration).<p>

<b>POPULATION CHANGE 1900-2000</b><br>
It helps to have a clear perspective of the past population change that the state has experienced
when considering the role of immigration in Nevada's current and future population change. 
Over the past 50 years, the population of the state has experienced phenomenal increase, i.e.,
nearly eleven-fold from 1940-90.  While most of the recent population increase has come from
migration into the state, from net international migration has contibuted about a third as much as
the natural rate (births-deaths) to which immigrants also contribute. <p>

<b>POPULATION PROJECTION</b><br>
The 1997 Census Bureau population projection has Nevada's population growing by 51%
between 1995 and 2025 (to 2,312,000).  That is the 5th fastest projected rate of growth in the
country.  <p>

The Census Bureau population projection noted above is the "middle" projection, and it assumes
immigration at a net annual increase of 820,000.  There are other projections based on different
assumptions.  In the Census Bureau's "high" immigration projection, assuming annual net
immigration of 1,370,000, the population in 2025 is more than six percent higher than in the
middle projection, and it is over 11 percent higher by 2050.  For Nevada, the high immigration
projection
could mean a population in 2050 of as many as 4,200,000 people.  If today's mass immigration
were
significantly scaled back, the population increase attributable to immigration and the
population spill-over effects from other states could be significantly reduced over time.  See <a

<b>METROPOLITAN AREA DATA -- <a href="msas/042nvren.htm">RENO</a></b><p>

<b>INS DATA ON IMMIGRANT SETTLEMENT</b><br>
Immigrant settlement in Nevada has risen since 
the adoption of the current immigration system in 1965.  Recent average settlement has been about 
ten times higher than the level of the late 1960s -- making Nevada one of the states most affected by the country's current mass immigration.<p>  
<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/nvins.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

Legal immigrant settlement in Nevada since 1990 has averaged over 5,800 per year.  The data
for fiscal year (FY) 1991 were artificially raised by the inclusion of some of the former illegal
aliens who were amnestied in 1986.  
Just among the long-term resident amnesty applicants (excluding the amnestied agricultural workers), the number applying from Nevada was 10,287. <p> 

The data for FY'95, FY'97 and FY'98 were artificially low because
the INS was not able to issue green cards to all the applicants for adjustment of status who
were already in the United States.  In those three years, new immigration could have registered
as much as 30 percent higher, if the INS had issued more visas.<p><PRE>

<b> ILLEGAL RESIDENT ALIENS </b><br>
The INS estimates that the October 1996 illegal alien population living in Nevada was 24,000. 
The previous INS estimate was that in October 1992 there were 18,000 illegal aliens, although
the INS now says it thinks it underestimated at that time by 1,000.  In any case, the numbers
show a rapidly growing illegal alien population.  Most of the illegal aliens are newcomers,
because in 1986 an amnesty was enacted that allowed illegal resident aliens to become legal
residents.  There were about 19,000 applicants from Nevada for the amnesty. <p>

In Reno, Nevada, the INS reported that 121 employees of the Atlantis hotel-casino had provided false
documents to illegal alien employees.  The maximum penalty on illegal workers for using false documents
to obtain employment is $250,000 in fines and five years in prison.  The Atlantis was not fined.  
(Source:  Migration News, August, 1998)<p>

In mid-August, 1988, a police action in Las Vegas in response to complaints about under-age
drinking at a Hispanic bar (El Portrero) led to the INS being called in and about 100 illegal aliens
being detained and then bussed back to Mexico.  The incident became a political football when
Hispanics organized a protest demonstration against the police and INS claiming that the action
was anti-Hispanic.  At a candidate forum hosted by the Latina Women's Political Caucus, the
demonstrators disrupted efforts to get the candidates to discuss public policy issues such as
bilingual education in the schools.  The organizer, Pricilla Rocha said "...Metro had every right to
investigate."  Humberto Pena, the local <i>El Heraldo</i> newspaper editor said "I think they're
being manipulated."  But activists like Maria Lopez said "They're not telling people the
consequences of leaving the country...they're not giving them a chance to consult an
attorney."<br>

<a name="1201">The booming Las Vegas Casino sector is attracting large numbers of Latino immigrants to the city.  
Despite a required police background check for new hires, that bars most illegal aliens seeking casino jobs,  
the city, nevertheless, is attracting large numbers of illegal aliens working in hotels and other jobs not requiring advanced education or skill levels and paying low wages.  
The presence of a large number of illegal aliens is attested to by the spread of money transfer and check cashing operations and the growth of immigration consultant services.<br>
