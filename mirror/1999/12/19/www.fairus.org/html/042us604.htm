<b>IMMIGRATION IS A NATIONAL ISSUE</b><br>
Americans now realize that the costs of our present high level of immigration (legal and illegal)
are enormous and growing.  (The Center for Immigration Studies estimated in 1995 that
immigration costs us a net  $29 billion a year--more than the combined budgets of the
Departments of State, Justice and Interior.)  These costs include both programs targeted toward
immigrants, as well as the increased costs of education, health care, and welfare programs that
are used by immigrants.<p>

Much of the news coverage of this problem focuses solely on the six states with the highest
immigration levels: California, New York, Texas, Florida, New Jersey and Ilinois. 
But do not be misled; high immigration is not a problem just for these six states, it is a
problem for the entire country.<p>

<b>EVERY STATE RECEIVES IMMIGRANTS AND FEELS THE IMPACT</b><br>
Every state receives immigration.  Mississippi, for example, is not known as a 'high-impact' state. 
Yet it has the nation's fastest growing immigrant population (up by 476% since 1990 -- from less
than 1% of its population then to about 4.3% now). Other states that are newly expreiencing
large-scale immigrant settlement  include Colorado (up 136%), North Carolina (up 129%),
Oregon (up 115%), Nebraska (up 107%) and Utah (up 102%). <p>

Consider Hawaii.  Although it receives fewer immigrants than, say, Florida, it still takes more
than its fair share.  In Hawaii, nine percent of the population consists of immigrants who arrived
since 1980; by way of comparison,  six percent of Florida's population  consists of recent
immigrants.<p>

<b>WE ALL PAY FOR IMMIGRATION THROUGH OUR FEDERAL TAXES</b><br>
Much of the cost for immigration is paid by the states and municipalities, but a lot is paid for by
the federal government too.  Illegal immigrants receive taxpayer support for their U.S.-born
children, immunizations, subsidized public health and other programs.  Legal immigrants are
eligible for almost all federal programs.  In many areas, such as education, the federal
government gives matching grants for state expenditures, which means paying twice for those
costs of immigration.  When states hand a bill to the federal government for the costs of
immigration
(as is provided for by law in the case of incarceration of illegal immigrants, or welfare programs
for the illegal aliens who were "amnestied" in 1986), it is you who will pay regardless of where
you live.  <p>

The U.S. is a vast country; it is easy to be deceived into thinking that what goes on in other states
does not affect us.  But, directly or indirectly, the impact of high immigration on our country hits
us all and hits us hard.  For that reason, all Americans should demand that their representatives in
Washington reduce the price they are paying for immigration.  The best way to cut those costs is
to reduce immigration itself.<p>

<b>1990 CENSUS DATA</b><br>
The foreign born are concentrated in a few states, although the distribution is changing rapidly as
jobs in the Midwest and Southwest attract large numbers of both legal and illegal immigrants.  In
the 1990 Census, six states accounted for nearly three-quarters of the 19.8 million foreign born
residents (many foreign born are missed in the Census undercount).  The six states and their
respective share of the foreign-born population are:  <a
href="042ca702.htm"><B>California</B></a> (32.7%), <a href="042ny702.htm"><B>New
York</B></a> (14.4%), <a href="042tx702.htm"><B>Texas</B></a> (8.4%), <a
href="042fl702.htm"><B>Florida</B></a> (7.7%), <a href="042nj702.htm"><B>New
Jersey</B></a>
(4.9%), and <a href="042il702.htm"><B>Illinois</B></a> (4.8%).  Detailed information from
the
1990 Census is available on the individual state pages, including information on the nationality
of the immigrants.<p>

For the nation as a whole, a list of the major nationalities of the <a href="042us-
fb.htm"><B>Foreign Born in the 1990 Census</B></a> is also available.<p>

<a name="105"><b>THE IMMIGRANT STOCK</b><br>
There are about 55 million people in the United States who may be considered "immgrant stock."
The immigrant stock is a term that refers to first generation immigrants, the "1.5 generation" 
(children of immigrants who are born abroad), and the second generation (the native-born Americans whose parents immigrated).
There are about 10 to 11 million children under the age 18 who are chldren of immigrants.  
This information is derived from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study. -- the largest research project on the topic in the country.<br>
(Source: <i>The Houston Chronicle</i>, October 3, 1999)<p>

<b>NATIONAL DATA FROM THE CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS)</b><br>
In 1998 the number of foreign-born residents (including some, but not all resident illegal aliens)
numbered an estimated 26,300,000.  That was 9.7 percent of the population -- up from 7.9
percent as
recently as the 1990
Census and 4.8 percent in 1970.  Just over one-third (35.1%) of the foreign born were naturalized
U.S.
citizens.  This was
down from 40 percent in 1990 despite the recent surge in naturalizations, because the recent
surge in
immigration means that a larger share are newcomers who are not yet eligible to apply for
naturalization.  As of 1996, 6,579,000 of the foreign-born residents had entered the United States
since 1990.<p>

The 1998 CPS data show that the share of the foreign born living below the poverty level is
much higher than it is for the
native born (20% and 12.7%, respectively).  The unemployment rate for the foreign born is
similarly higher than for the native born (5.6% and 4.6% respectively), and it is also higher for
food stamp recipiency (9.3% and 6.8%) and public assistance income receipts (4.6% and
3.1%).  The data on the foreign born receipt of welfare benefits is artificially low because
included in the foreign born population are illegal alien residents who are barred from these
programs.<p>

<b>NET INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION</b><br>
The Census Bureau released national population estimates in December 1998 that put the
population in July 1998 at 270,299,000.  That represented a one-year increase of about 1.1
million.  Since 1990, the NIM total amount of increase has been 6,697,000 (an average annual
net increase of over 837,000).  All of the states (and Washington DC) were estimated to
have had population increases due to net international migration. The amount of the last
year's estimated increase is shown below in the column marked <b>"97-98 NIM."</b><p>

width=500><img src="stateimg/usproj.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></right></center><p>

<b>POPULATION PROJECTION</b><br>
The 1997 Census Bureau population projection has the nation growing by 27.5 percent
between 1995 and 2025 (increasing more than 60 million above the 1995 estimated population to
335,048,000).  The projected rate of increase is less than the rate of increase in the foreign-born
population between 1980 and 1990, and it is clear that immigrant settlement is a major
component in the rate of projected population increase.<p>

The chart (above) is based on a projection of U.S. population growth through the year 2050.  The
projection was done by the Census Bureau in 1996 with different assumptions (scenarios).  The two scenarios depicted in the
chart are for zero-net immigration and the "middle series" based on the current demographic
trend, including immigration.  FAIR judges that the middle series projection understates future population growth,
because the assumptions about the level of both legal and illegal immigration appear to be too low.<p>
  
The zero-net scenario assumes the number of new immigrants
coming into the country balances those who leave or die.  The difference of about 80 million people between the two
scenarios depicts the impact of post-1990 immigrants and their offspring on the size of U.S.
population.  That amount shows how today's and tomorrow's immigrants and their offspring are likely to account for over 60 percent of 
the nation's population growth over the next half century if nothing is done to change current policies. <p>

In the Census Bureau's "high" immigration projection, assuming annual net
immigration of 1,370,000, the population in 2025 is more than six percent higher than in the
middle projection, and it is over 11 percent higher by 2050.  The high immigration projection
would mean a U.S. population in 2050 of 438,299,000 people.  If today's mass immigration were
significantly scaled back, the population increase attributable to immigration could be
significantly reduced over time.  See <a href="04109604.htm">Immigration and Population
Growth</a></font><p>

<b>INS DATA ON IMMIGRANT SETTLEMENT</b><br>
Immigrant settlement in the United States has risen since 
the adoption of the current immigration system in 1965.  The recent rate of new immigrants has about tripled from the rate of the late 1960s.<p>

<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/usins.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

Each year the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) releases annual data on the number
of new immigrants.  Some are newly arrived from abroad and others may already be in the
United States in another status before being granted immigrant status.  The number of new
immigrants by state beginning with fiscal year 1991 are provided below for the country as a whole (and in summary form table below by state in the column <b>"91-97
Legal,"</b>.<p>  

INS data show that since 1990 the average number of immigrants admitted for legal residence has been over 950,000 per year (through FY'98).  This average is inflated
by the effects of the 1986 amnesty for illegal aliens, as 1.1 million of the 1991 "new"
immigrants were part of the nearly three million former illegal aliens converting their status.  
Just among the long-term resident amnesty applicants (excluding the amnestied agricultural workers), the number applying nationwide was 1,663,595. <p> 
The data for FY'95, FY'97 and FY'98 were artificially low because the
INS was not able to issue green cards to all the applicants for adjustment of status who
were already in the United States.  In those three years, new immigration could have registered
as much as 30 percent higher, if the INS had issued more visas.  If the INS begins to catch up with its backlog of adjustment to legal residence, 
there will have been over ten million new immigrants admitted during this decade -- and unprecedented number.<p><PRE>

It should also be kept in mind that the INS numbers for legal
immigrant settlement understate the impact of immigration because there are additional hundreds
of thousands of immigration applicants already in the United States in a backlog caused by INS
processing problems who are eligible for immigrant status but have not yet received their green
cards.  The number in this backlog has been growing rapidly in the past several years and stands at 881,000 at the end of fiscal year 1998. <p>
