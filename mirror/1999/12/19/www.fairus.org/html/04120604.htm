<b><i>The polling company</i></b>, for Negative Population Growth, phone poll September 23-27, 1999 (500 likely Florida voters, margin of error 4.4%).<br><ul>
<li>Nearly 60 percent of Florida voters say adding another 5 million residents to Florida's 
population [the amount of increase now projected by 2025] is either an "extremely serious" or "serious" problem.  <br>
<li>Over 70 percent believe Florida's overcrowding and overpopulation is a major problem.<br>
<li>68 percent agee that "Florida would be better-off in the long term with a smaller population to maintain a sound economy and a healthy environment."<br>
<li>A similar number want immigration scaled back.</ul><p>


<b><i>Wall Street Journal</i>/NBC News</b> phone poll, Dec. 3-6, 1998 (margin of error
2.2%).<br>
"Despite an unemployment rate that is the lowest in three decades, by a more than 3-to-1 margin
respondents said the U.S. shouldn't allow more immigrants into the country because they take
jobs that Americans should have ["should not" - 72%, "should" - 20%, "not sure" - 8%].  The
opposition was equally overwhelming, 72% to 21%,  to permitting skilled immigrants to move
here to fill a shortage of trained workers in the computer industry -- an exception that the
technology lobby just won from Congress and the White House."<br>
(Source:  <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> December 10, 1998)<br>
<font size="-1">[Respondents were asked which of two statements "you agree with more: (A)
Some people believe that we should increase the number of immigrants who are let into the
country, because they fill a number of jobs that many companies have trouble filling,"  OR" (B)
Others believe that we should not increase the number of immigrants who are let in, because they
will take jobs that Americans should have and will ultimately result in higher unemployment." 
The second question asked: "Many computer and software companies are experiencing a
shortage of trained workers.  Do you believe that we should or should not change our
immigration policies to allow more people trained in these fields to come into the United
States?"]</font><p>

<b>Hart-Teeter poll for <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> February 1998:</b><br>
<b>Question:</b> "Do you think immigration strengthens or weakens the American
character?"<br>
<b>Response:</b>  By a margin of about three to two among 2,004 respondents, most said
"weakens."  There was no statistically significant difference between males and females, or
whites and blacks supporting this view. But immigrants who responded disagreed.  They thought
they "strengthen" the U.S. by a margin of about 13 to seven.<br>

Asked in 12 countries whether respondents would like to emigrate to another country 
and asked to identify the country, the following is a calculation of those who would 
become immigrants to the United States if they could:
<pre>COUNTRY        PCT. MOVE TO U.S.  NUMBER (1995 POP.)

                                    97,331,000</pre><font="-1">Extrapolating from these data, 
about 400 million person around the world would come to the United States if the doors were 
thrown oen to all comers.  (The number might even be higher because developed countries are overrepresented in the 
survey, and the percentage who would emigrate is lower for these countries.)</font><p>
