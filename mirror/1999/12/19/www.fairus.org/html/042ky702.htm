<b> 1990 CENSUS DATA ON FOREIGN-BORN SETTLEMENT </b><br> 
Between 1980 and 1990, Kentucky experienced very little overall population growth, and the
foreign-born population actually declined slightly (from 34,568 to 34,119). The state's
immigrants are concentrated most in the Lexington-Fayette area, accounting for about one-fifth
of the state total.  <p>

The nationalities of Kentucky's immigrant population changed little between 1980 and 1990,
with immigrants from Germany and the United Kingdom at the top of the list, accounting for
over one-fifth of the total. <p>

<b>THE IMMIGRANT STOCK</b><br>
There are about 117 thousand people in Kentucky who may be considered "immgrant stock."
The immigrant stock is a term that refers to first generation immigrants, the "1.5 generation" 
(children of immigrants who are born abroad), and the second generation (the native-born Americans whose parents immigrated).<p>

<b> 1998 CPS DATA ON THE FOREIGN BORN </b><br>
In the most recent Census Bureau estimate, Kentucky's overall population increased by about
24,000 (0.6%).  The 1998 CPS data, analyzed by the Center for Immigration Studies, showed
the immigrant population jumped by 18,000.  As a result of these two trends, the share of the
state's population comprised of immigrants increased to 1.7 percent.<p>

The Census Bureau calculates that since the 1990 Census the state's population has increased by
nearly 14,000 because of immigration, while over the same period the state's population has
increased by 90,000 due to the arrival of migrants from other states in excess of
established residents leaving for other states.<p>

<b> 1997 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS) DATA </b><br>
 Over half of the new immigrant settlement occurred in just two counties: Jefferson (+3,474) and
Fayette (+1,949).  Jefferson County lost many more residents to domestic migration than it
gained from immigration.<p>

<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/ky-net.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

The share of Kentucky's immigrant population that had become naturalized U.S. citzens by 1997
was less than one third and less than the national average of 35 percent.<p> 

<b>METROPOLITAN AREA DATA - <a
href="msas/042kylex.htm">LEXINGTON</a></b><p>

<b>NET INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION</b><br>
The Census Bureau estimates that Kentucky's population increased by 26,053 over the last
year (ending in July 1997).  Compared to that overall increase, net international migration
accounted for an estimated increase of 1,518.  Thus immigration accounted for about six
percent of the state's population increase (that is about one-quarter of the national median share
of population increase due to immigration).<p>

<b>POPULATION CHANGE 1900-2000</b><br>
It helps to have a clear perspective of the past population change that the state has experienced
when considering the role of immigration in Kentucky's current and future population change. 
Over the past 50 years, the population of the state has increased by about one million persons,
or about one-third.  Nearly as much of recent population growth has come from inter-state
migration and net international migration as from birth rates, to which immigrants also
contribute. <p>

width=500><img src="stateimg/kyproj.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></right></center><p>

<b>POPULATION PROJECTION</b><br>
The 1997 Census Bureau population projection has Kentucky's population growing by 12%
between 1995 and 2025 (to 4,314,000).  That is a lower rate of increase than the national
median.<p>

The Census Bureau population projection noted above is the "middle" projection, and it assumes
immigration at a net annual increase of 820,000.  There are other projections based on different
assumptions.  In the Census Bureau's "high" immigration projection, assuming annual net
immigration of 1,370,000, the population in 2025 is more than six percent higher than in the
middle projection, and it is over 11 percent higher by 2050.  For Kentucky, the high projection
could mean a population in 2050 of 6,400,000 to 6,500,000.  If immigration were
significantly scaled back, the population increase attributable to immigration and the
population spill-over effects from other states could be significantly reduced over time.  See <a
href="04109604.htm">Immigration and Population Growth</a></font><p>

<a name="1129"><b>INS DATA ON IMMIGRANT SETTLEMENT</b><br>
Immigrant settlement in Kentucky has risen since 
the adoption of the current immigration system in 1965.  Recent average settlement has been nearly three-fold the level of the late 1960s.<p>  
<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/kyins.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center>
<p>

Legal immigrant settlement in Kentucky since 1990 has averaged about 2,000 per
year.  The data for FY'95 and FY'97 were artificially low because the INS was not able to issue
green cards to all the applicants for adjustment of status who were already in the United States. 
In those two years, new immigration could have registered as much as 30 percent higher, if the
INS had issued more visas.<p><PRE>

<b>INS DATA BY NATIONALITY: FY'91-FY'97</b><BR>
The INS data below are the totals for the countries with the largest number of immigrants
admitted or adjusted to legal residence since 1990. The nationalities may change each year, so
the totals in some cases will not reflect all the immigrants of that nationality who have become
legal immigrants in Kentucky during the seven-year period. Data on German admissions includes only five of the 
seven years and for Japan the admission data is available for only three years. The 26 nationalities (Hong Kong
and Taiwan included with mainland Chinese, and the former Soviet Union represented by Russia
and Ukraine since FY'96) represent over 76 percent of all immigrant settlement and
adjustment in Kentucky during this seven-year period.<center><PRE>

<b>INS ESTIMATE OF ALIENS ELIGIBLE FOR CITIZENSHIP</b><br>
The INS estimates that as of April 1996 there were about 21,000 legal resident aliens in
Kentucky -- legal immigrants who had not yet become U.S. citizens -- of whom
11,500 had met the residency requirement to apply for citizenship.  Included in this number
could be aliens who had already applied for naturalization and were in the processing waiting
list.  The INS offices that handle naturalization cases and fingerprinting are located
at: <br><center>INS LOUISVILLE<br>
ROOM 601<br>
601 W. BROADWAY<br>
LOUISVILLE, KY 40202</center><p>

<b> ILLEGAL RESIDENT ALIENS </b><br>
The INS issued a new estimate of the illegal alien population that identified Kentucky as having
about 6,000 illegal residents as of October 1996.  This represented a 30% increase over its
estimate of the illegal alien population in October 1992. <p>

One measure of the illegal resident alien population may be seen in the applications for the amnesty for illegal aliens enacted in 1986.  
Just among the long-term resident amnesty applicants (excluding the amnestied agricultural workers), the number of applicants from Kentucky was 381.   <p>

Foreign-born workers are reportedly seeking jobs in construction, on tobacco farms and in meat
and poultry plants in Kentucky.  In October, 1996, the INS won its first conviction of a Kentucky
employer, the Valley Fresh chicken-processing plant in Glasgow, for knowingly hiring illegal
alien workers.  Wages were $5 hourly. <p> 

In September, 1996, Kentucky police stopped a rented truck taking 31 illegal aliens to North
Carolina, but the short-staffed INS told the police to let the truck continue its journey.  <br>

The INS conducted a raid in May at a Lexington tobacco warehouse with more than 80 illegal
aliens arrested.  Lexington mayor Pam Miller announced on June 1 that she was creating a task
force on immigration.<br>

The INS conducted a raid in Lexington on May 19 at the G.F. Vaughan Tobacco & Storage Co.
tobacco warehouse with more than 80 illegal aliens arrested.  Lexington mayor Pam Miller
announced on June 1 that she was creating a task force on immigration.  Subsequently, two of
the Mexican illegal workers, both females, who had left the United States voluntarily,  reentered
illegally from Mexico and were re-arrested at the Department of Labor office in Lexington when
they sought to obtain back wages  owed by the tobacco firm.  This time the two face deportation
hearings, after which, if they again reenter the country illegally they can be sent to prison.
According to Lexington Hispanic Association, the May 19 arrests and removals left behind 50
families.  [Comment: Many of the remaining family members are presumably also illegal aliens. 
Their continued residence in Lexington indicates that the voluntarily departing family member
intends to sneak back into the country to rejoin them.]<br>
(Source: <i>Lexington Herald-Leader,</i> June 5, 1998) </font><p>

Kentucky labor and agricultural officials are pursuing a strategy to determine how many of the
state's 25,000 agricultural workers are illegal aliens and how workers can be better channeled
into the legal temporary agricultural worker (H-2A) program.  At present there are only about
2,300 participants in the H-2A program in the state, and some farmers estimate that as many as
90 percent of agricultural workers are illegal aliens.<br>
(Source: <i>Lexington Herald-Leader,</i> June 16, 1998) </font><p>

<b>Task Force on Immigrant Issues</b>  Lexington Mayor Pam Miller has constituted a task
force to study the issues related to the influx of aliens, many of whom are illegal workers. 
Accoding to a Fayette County farmer, after hiring a new crew of workers, they all turn out to be
illegal aliens. "So what do you do?" he asked.  The president of the Lexington Hispanic Assn.,
Ben Figueras, had proposed tha tLexington declare itself a "safe" city for illegal aliens.<br>
