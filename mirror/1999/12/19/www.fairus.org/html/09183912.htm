<center><h3>Visa Fraud by French Hairstyling Chain</h3></center><hr><p>
<i>Jacques Dessange</i> Inc. was caught by the INS falsifying company records in applications for visas to bring French hairstylists and colorists to the United States to staff new beauty salons being opened in this country.  
The president of the France-based Franklin Holdings, the parent company, is under indictment on 30 counts of immigration fraud and faces up to 10 years in prison on each count and the firm could be fined half a million dollars.  
The firm protests that it was the victim of bad advice from immigration lawyers who convinced them to try to pass the salon workers off as company executives.  
The firm created organizational charts with fictitious positions and falsely claimed that the foreigners would be earning $1,000 per month.  
The head of the operation in France noted "We think it's a gross and unfair overreaction by U.S. authorities.  <br>
