<h2><center>Immigration and Traffic Congestion</h2></center>
<p>
According to a report by the Texas Transportation Institute (<i>Urban Roadway Congestion Annual Report</i>, 1998), Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Miami are the most congested cities in the nation. 
The <i>Congressional Quarterly</i> publication <i>CQ Outlook</i> devoted a 13-page analysis to the nature of the traffic congestion problem raised by the Texas institute in its October 16, 1999 issue.  
Yet the focus of the article was how to cope with the problem.  
Absent in its discussion -- and in that of most urban planners -- is attention to the way the nation is increasing its population -- and thereby the number of drivers and cars on the road -- through immigration.
Understanding that fact is an essential first step to participating in the growing national discussion of whether we would be better off if the current mass immigration flow were abated. <p>

The following table shows the top twelve "most congested" large cities, according to the Texas institute, and the number of new immigrants who have settled in those metropolitan areas between 1991 and 1998 (according to data from the Immigration and Naturalization Service).<p>

<pre>    Metro Area         New Immigration</b>
                           (FY 1991-98)
 1. Los Angeles                811,510
 2. Washington, D.C.           232,056
 3. Miami                      297,142
 4. Chicago                    319,687
 5. San Francisco              156,387
 6. Seattle                     81,006
 7. Detroit                     83,565
 8. Atlanta                     69,278
 9. San Diego                  169,832
10. Riverside                  125,902
11. Las Vegas                    (n/a)
12. New York                 <u>  978,208</u>
                             3,324,573</pre></center><p>

In addition to these more than 3.3 million new residents legally settling in these congested metro areas, they were joined by countless numbers of illegal alien residents.<p>

Can anything be done about this immigration component of the population increase and its impact on the livability of our communities?  
Certainly.  Immigration policy is set by Congress.  If our elected representatives wanted to cut today's mass legal immigration in half or to one-third of its nearly a million-a-year level, it could do so easily. 
Moreover, not only could Congress mandate these reductions, it could do so without any significant curtailment of our refugee program, the ability to bring immediate family members into this country or programs to let employers bring in temporary workers for high-tech jobs.  Congress could also decrease the out-of-control invasion of illegal workers by making effective the ban on employers hiring them.  <p>

Would that make a large contribution to reducing population increase, urban sprawl and traffic congestion?  You bet.<p>
