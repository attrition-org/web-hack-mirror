<h2><center>The Unintended Consequences of the 1965 Law</h2></center>
<p>
When the present immigration system was created by the 1965 Immigration Act, Congress said that the immigrant flow would not change very much; Congress was wrong. 
Congress should admit its mistake and undo the provisions of the 1965 Act that favored the admission of relatives of recent immigrants and that have led to such drastic changes in the immigration flow.<p>

<center> <b>WHAT WE WERE TOLD IN 1965</b><p>  </center>
<b>The Number of Immigrants Will Not Rise.   </b><ul>
<li><i>“It would not substantially increase the total number of immigrants to be admitted to the United States.”</i> <br>- Senator William Proxmire (D-WI)    <br>
<li><i>“[T]his does not mean that the bill would permit a flood tide of new immigrants into this country.  As a matter of fact, the total number of potential immigrants would not be changed very much.”</i> <br>- Senator Daniel Inouye (D-HI)   <br> 
<li><i>“Under the proposed bill, the total number of immigrants  remains approximately the same.”</i> <br>- Senator Thomas Kuchel (D-CA).    <br>
<li><i>“The bill does not seek to increase to any great extent the annual number of new immigrants we admit.”</i> <br>- Senator Bob Bartlett (D-AK) <br>   
<li><i>“This bill would not attempt to make any drastic changes  in our overall immigration numbers.”</i> <br>- Senator Frank Moss. (D-UT)    <br>
<li><i>“Total quota numbers [of immigrant visas] available  will be only slightly increased.”</i> <br>- Senator Pat McNamara (D-MI)    <p></ul></ul>
<center><b><a href="04175911.htm#rise">WERE THEY RIGHT?</b></a></center><p>
<b>The Mix of Immigrants Will Not Change.</b><ul>  
<li><i>“[This bill] will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area or the most populated and economically deprived  nations of Africa and Asia.”</i> <br>- Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA)   
<li><i>“Immigration from any single country would be limited to 10 percent of the total...with the possible exception of ... Great Britain and Germany.”</i> <br>- Senator Robert Kennedy (D-NY)   
<li><i>“Maybe there will be a huge surge [in the number of immigrants] from India or a huge surge[in the number of immigrants] from Africa,  but I would tend to doubt it.”</i> <br>- Senator Claiborne Pell (R-RI)    
<li><i>“The people who have built up America, the Anglo-Saxons and the northern people of Europe, are not discriminated against in this bill ... the people from [the Asia-Pacific Triangle] probably will never reach 1 percent of the population.  Our cultural pattern will never be changed as far as America is concerned.  It will become more cosmopolitan but still there is that fundamental adherence to European culture.”</i> <br>- Senator Hiram Fong (D-HI)    
<li><i>“No immigrant visa will be issued to a person  who is likely to become a public charge.”</i> <br>- Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA)    
<li><i>“The notion was created that somehow or another, 190 million [the population in 1965] is going to be swallowed up.  None of us would want that, this bill does not seek to do it and the bill could not do it.”</i> <br>- Senator Philip Hart (D-MI)    
<li><i>“I do not think it amounts to a serious increase in the number of persons admitted ... I doubt if this bill will really be the cause of  crowding the present Americans out of the 50 states.”</i> <br>- Senator Hugh Scott (R-PA)    
<li><i>“This bill is not designed to increase or accelerate the number of newcomers permitted to come to America. ...I would expect very little change ... in the immigration from the Western hemisphere.”</i> <br>- Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach </ul></ul>

<li>Top Five Source Countries for Immigrants<br> 
1965: Mexico, Canada, Italy, United Kingdom, Germany <br>
1998: Mexico, China, India, Philippines, Dominican Rep.<br>
Mexico received 20 percent of the admissions in 1998. The United Kingdom received 1.4 percent, and Germany less than 1 percent.
