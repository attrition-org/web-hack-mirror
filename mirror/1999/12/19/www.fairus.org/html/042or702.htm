<b> 1990 CENSUS DATA ON THE FOREIGN BORN </b><br>
Oregon's 1990 foreign-born population numbered about 139,000.  This was an increase of 29
percent over the 1980 number and accounted for over 15 percent of the state's overall population
growth.  The rate of increase was the 15th fastest in the country. <p> 

The share of the overall immigrant population in 1990 was about five percent, less than the
national average of 7.9 percent, but still exceeded by only 17 other states. <p>

The nationality of the greatest number of immigrants was Mexico -- comprising over one-fifth of
the state's foreign-born total.  This was very different from 1980, when Mexican immigrants
numbered less than 9,000, and the largest foreign-born group was Canadian. <p>

Multnomah County accounts for nearly 30 percent of the state's total foreign-born population
(about 41,500 in 1990).  That is a foreign-born rate of 7.1 percent.  The rest of the state has a 4.3
percent rate of immigrant settlement.  The Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area has a
foreign-born population of about 88,000 and a settlement rate of 5.8 percent.  That rate is the
same as in the Salem metropolitan area, where about 16,200 immigrants live. <p>

According to the 1990 Census, about 7.3 percent of Oregonians say they speak some language
other than English at home.<p>

<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/or-net.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

<b>THE IMMIGRANT STOCK</b><br>
There were about 594 thousand people in Oregon in 1997 who may be considered "immgrant stock."
The immigrant stock is a term that refers to first generation immigrants, the "1.5 generation" 
(children of immigrants who are born abroad), and the second generation (the native-born Americans whose parents immigrated).<p>

<b> 1998 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS) DATA </b><br>
The estimate of Oregon's population by the Census Bureau, based on 1998 CPS data, shows an
increase of about 38,000 over the past year.  An analysis of the CPS data by the Center for
Immigration Studies reflects a rise of 8,000 in the foreign-born population over the same period. 
As a result the state's foreign-born share increased slightly to 9.4 percent, just under the national
average, but exceeded by only 13 other states and the District of Columbia.  The Census Bureau
estimates that since the 1990 Census the state's population has increased by 58,000 from net
immigration (NIM) and by nearly 260,000 from net domestic migration (NDM, i.e.,more persons
from other states settling in Oregon than Oregonians leaving.)<p>

<b> 1997 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS) DATA </b><br>
According to the 1997 CPS, Oregon's population has increased by over 401,500 (14.1%) since
1990.  That rate of increase is exceeded by only nine other states.  About 48,700 of that increase
was due to immigrant settlement (NIM).  This rate of 12.1 percent of population increase
attributable to immigration is about the national median rate.  However, it is more than double
the 4.9 percent share of the state's population that was foreign born in the 1990 Census,
indicating a rising immigrant share. <p>

Among Oregon's immigrants, the share who had become naturalized U.S. citizens was less than
one-quarter (22.7%).  This is lower than the national average of 35 percent, in part because more
recent immigrants are not yet eligible to apply for citizenship.<p>

About half of the new immigrant settlement was in the Portland metropolitan area (Multnomah
County +15,362 and Washington County  +9,211) and an additional 5,848 additional immigrants
located in Marion County (Salem).<p>

<b>POPULATION CHANGE 1900-2000</b><br>
When considering the role of  immigration in Oregon's current and future population change, it is
helpful to have a clear perspective of the past population change that the state has
experienced.<p>

Over the past 50 years, the population of the state has more than doubled.  Most of recent
population growth has come not from natural birth rates, but from persons moving to the state
from other states.  This is not surprising when compared to a neighboring state like California
that has had about two million residents moving out since 1990 -- at the same time that
California's immigrant population has increased by nearly as many persons.<p>

<b>POPULATION PROJECTION 2000-2025</b><br>
The 1997 Census Bureau population  projection has Oregon's population growing by 28 percent
between 2000 and 2025 (to 4,349,000).  That is the 12th fastest projected rate of growth in the
country.  The rate of increase in the foreign-born population between 1980 and 1990 (29%) was
even higher than the projected rate, and it is clear that the projection contemplates continued
major immigrant settlement in the state.<p>

The Census Bureau population projection noted above is the "middle" projection, and it assumes
immigration at a net annual increase of 820,000.  There are other projections based on different
assumptions.  In the Census Bureau's "high" immigration projection, assuming annual net
immigration of 1,370,000, the population in 2025 is more than six percent higher than in the
middle projection, and it is over 11 percent higher by 2050.  For Oregon, the high immigration
projection could mean a population in 2050 of 5,800,000 people.  If today's mass immigration
were
significantly scaled back, the population increase attributable to immigration and the
population spill-over effects from other states could be significantly reduced over time.  See <a
href="04109604.htm">Immigration and Population Growth</a></font><p>

<b>INS DATA ON IMMIGRANT SETTLEMENT</b><br>
Immigrant settlement in Oregon has risen since 
the adoption of the current immigration system in 1965.  The recent rate of new immigrants is four to five times the rate of the late 1960s.<p>
<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/orins.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

INS data indicate that since 1990 the annual average number of new legal immigrants identifying
Oregon as their intended residence has been about 9,300 (through FY'97). The data for fiscal year
(FY) 1991 were artificially raised by the inclusion of some of the former illegal aliens who were
amnestied in 1986.  Between one-quarter and one-third of all immigrant settlement in Oregon
during this period was accounted for by the legalization of about 17,000 Mexicans. 
Just among the long-term resident amnesty applicants (excluding the amnestied agricultural workers), the number applying from Oregon was 3,990.  <p>

 The data for FY'95 and FY'97 were artificially low because the INS was not able to issue green
cards to all the applicants for adjustment of status who were already in the United States.  In
those two years, new immigration could have registered as much as 30 percent higher,
if the INS had been able to keep up with its workload.<p>

The principal countries of immigration were Mexico, former Soviet Union, Vietnam, and China
(including Hong Kong and Taiwan).  Mexicans alone accounted for more than four out of
every ten immigrants (40.8%).  With the other three, these top four sources of
immigrants account for nearly 70 percent of the total influx. <p>

Below are the totals for each of the fiscal years since 1990 and connections for additional details
of the new immigrants by nationality.<center><PRE>

<b>REFUGEE SETTLEMENT</b><br>
Multnomah County and the City of Portland have one of the highest refugee to natural-born
citizen ratios in the United States.  In Multnomah County, one in 26 residents came as a refugee. 
One in 22 Portlanders was originally a refugee. <br>
<font size="-1">(Source:  <i>Oregonian,</I> February 16, 1993) </font><p>

The federal government gives Multnomah County $207 a month for each refugee for primary
dental and health care.  However, this coverage only lasts eight months.  The total dental and
health care cost per refugee is $1,656 a year. <br>

Oregon received its first Kosovo refugees in June 1999.  Although the family of three were Moslems, their settlement was coordinated by the Jewish Family and Child Service organization.  
The refugees will receive $503 a month from the state as well as coverage by the Oregon Health Plan and federal assistance in the form of food stamps.<br>

<b>INS ESTIMATE OF ALIENS ELIGIBLE FOR CITIZENSHIP</b><br>
The INS estimates that as of April 1996 there were about 78,000 legal resident aliens in
Oregon -- legal immigrants who had not yet become U.S. citizens -- of whom
47,000 had met the residency requirement to apply for citizenship.  Included in this number
could be aliens who had already applied for naturalization and were in the processing waiting
list.  The INS office that handles naturalization cases and fingerprinting is located

Oregon's Latino enrollment rose over the past decade by 185 percent to 47,027 in 1999.  
The overall inrollment rise during the same period was 18 percent.  
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, Latino children are far more likely "...to live in poverty, come from single-parent households, have parents who did not finish school, speak limited English and attend troubled schools."  
At Alder Elementary School in Gresham, about half of the 620 students are Latino (up 28% in the last year).  
Other schools have also registered large increases in Latino enrollment:  Henry in Hillsboro (up 11%), Cornelius near Forest Grove (up 14%), and Barnes in Gresham (up 35%).  
About 30,000 Latino student from migrant backgrounds have a drop-out rate of about 16 percent, more than double the state average.  
<font size="-1"> (Source:  <I>Oregonian, </I> Jan. 19, 1999) </font><p>

The Oregon Health Plan is losing ground despite big increases in spending, at least in part because of the continuing flow of new poverty-level immigrant applicants.  
The immigration connection may be seen in information from the <i>Clinica del Cario</i> health center in Hood River in an area that serves the largely foreign-born migrant labor population.  
In this clinic, more than two-thirds of its 23,000 beneficiaries are below the poverty line.  
<font size="-1"> (Source:  <I>Oregonian, </I> March 29, 1999) </font><p>
 
According to Barry Edmonston, director of the Center for Population Research and Census at Portland State Univ., population growth and crowding in Portland area schools are related to immigration.  "If it weren't for immigration, the school-age enrollment would level off and decline," he said.  
In the past decade, state enrollment has risen by about 15 percent to nearly 543,000 in 1998.  
Nationwide, one in five elementary and high school students have at least one parent who is foreign born, and one in 20 were themselves foreign born.  
The effects of this immigrant surge may be seen in special English instruction (ESL) programs.  
In Beaverton, the number of ESL classrooms jumped from seven in 1994 to 41 in 1999.  
Even in older communities, such as Beaver Acres, the ESL class has had to move twice because of overcrowding.<br>

He was deported in September 1999 after completing a 36-month probationary sentence.  
Antonio Porras, the lawyer for the deported alien, Hector Carillo-Landeros, commented "I know it is a tough call, but the governor did the right thing."  
As a result of the pardon, Carillo-Landeros becomes eligible to return to the United States.

The INS estimates the resident illegal alien population in Oregon to be 33,000 in October 1996. 
The last estimate of the INS was that there were 20,000 illegal aliens in October 1992.  The INS
now says that it's earlier  estimate was too low, and should have been 27,000.  If the revised 1992
estimate is used, what appears to be a 65 percent increase in the illegal alien population
diminishes to 22 percent. <p>

Committee of Portland has alleged police harassment on March 5 and 6, 1999.  The police
reportedly threatened to call the INS [suggesting that the laborers may be illegal aliens]  if the
laborers did not disperse.  Yet, on March 11, at 9 a.m. there were some 35 men milling around

Prosecutions in Portland of aliens who have reentered the United States after being deported rose 36 percent between 1995 and 1998, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.  
Through October, 1999, the office had filed 194 cases since the beginning of the year.  
These cases are only being filed for aliens with previous felony convictions.  Defendants, most of whom plead guilty, are likely to face a sentence of two-and-a-half years, rather than the maximum felony conviction of 20 years in prison.<br>
