<h2><p align=center>Washington:  Illegal Aliens </p></h2> </center><hr><p>

<b> ILLEGAL ALIENS </b><br>
The INS estimates the number of illegal resident aliens in Washington at 52,000 as of October
1996.  It previously had estimated the number at 30,000 in October 1992.  It now states that it
earlier underestimated the illegal population by 12,000.  Depending on the earlier number, the
illegal resident alien population is believed to have grown by 22,000 (73%) or by 10,000 (24%)
over the past four years.  Following the 1986 amnesty for illegal resident aliens, 37,000 applied
from Washington to "legalize" their status. <p>

Washington State's prisons have 14 percent undocumented aliens according to the U.S.
Attorney's Office. <font size="-1"> (Source: AP February 13, 1996.) </font><p>

INS inspections, which decreased in 1996 when agents were sent to augment patrols at the border
with Mexico, have increased in 1997 as the inspectors came back.  As a result, apprehensions of
illegal aliens in Washington and North Idaho have increased from 17 operations and 140 arrests
in FY'96 to 36 operations and 296 arrests so far in FY'97 (October 1 through May 31).  This
increase in operations has provoked complaints among seasonal crop agricultural producers, who
apparently fear having their access to illegal migrant labor disrupted by a greater fear among the
illegal aliens of being apprehended if they come to the area for work.  However, in Eastern
Washington, no labor shortage has yet become a problem.<br>

1997</font><p>

On November 24, 1997 INS agents apprehended 100 Mexican illegal aliens working in four
Sherwood Forest Farms sites around Centralia.  These farms produce wreaths and other holiday
decorations.<br>

The INS has recently been targeting employment sectors that have traditionally hired illegal aliens and has
sent notices to employers identifying questionable employment documents.  This has resulted in large
numbers of workers leaving the worksite in advance of INS inspectors arriving to interview them.<p>

<a name="1013">In October, 1999 a state trooper was shot and killed by the occupant of a stopped vehicle in the Tri-Cities area.  One of the two 
occupants, Nicolas Solorio Vasquez, has been charged with the murder.  Solorio was out on bail after a narcotics trafficking arrest.  
The INS has identified him as having been deported on three previous occassions.  The Franklin County jail officials 
would not comment on the issue of why Solorio had not been turned over to the INS after his cocaine arrest.  According to a 
Border Patrol union official, the release of Solorio might have been due to the temporary 
assignment of staff to the Arizona border.<br>
