<b> 1990 CENSUS DATA ON THE FOREIGN BORN </b><br>
Minnesota's foreign-born population registered a modest increase between 1980 and 1990
(5.2%).  However, the top five source nationalities  (Canada, Germany, Sweden,
Korea, and the United Kingdom) registered declines.  Countries that supplied growing numbers
of immigrants were Laos (+277%), Vietnam (+52%) and Mexico (+76%). <p>

Over three-quarters (78%) of the state's foreign-born population live in the Minneapolis
metropolitan area.  The over 88,000 foreign born living there in 1990 constitute 3.5% of the
population, less than the national average in the country (7.9%).  The only higher concentration
of immigrants in a municipal area is in Rochester, where the rate is 4% based on a foreign-born
community of about 4,300.  Duluth had a slightly larger number of immigrants, but a
concentration of only 1.8%. <p> 

In 1990, 44% of Minnesota's foreign-born population had arrived since 1980.<p>

<b>THE IMMIGRANT STOCK</b><br>
There were about 501 thousand people in Minnesota in 1997 who may be considered "immgrant stock."
The immigrant stock is a term that refers to first generation immigrants, the "1.5 generation" 
(children of immigrants who are born abroad), and the second generation (the native-born Americans whose parents immigrated).<p>

<b>1998 CPS DATA ON THE FOREIGN BORN </b><br>
The 1988 estimate by the Census Bureau of Minnesota's population, based on the CPS, indicated
a rise of 39,870 (to 4,725,418).  The increase resulting from net international migration (NIM)
was 8,763, and therefore constituted about one-fifth (22%) of the overall increase.<p>

<b>1997 CPS DATA ON THE FOREIGN BORN </b><br>
About one-third of the state's foreign born were U.S. citizens in 1997. <p>

<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/mn-net.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

<b>NET INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION</b><br>
The Census Bureau estimates that Minnesota's population increased by 36,953 over the last
year (ending in July 1997).  Compared to that overall increase, net international migration
accounted for an estimated increase of 5,713.  Thus immigration accounted for nearly
16 percent of the state's population increase (that is about two-thirds the national median share of
population increase due to immigration).<p>

<b>POPULATION CHANGE 1900-2000</b><br>
When considering the role of  immigration in Minnesota's current and future population change,
it is helpful to have a clear perspective of the past population change that the state has
experienced.  Over the past 50 years, the population of the state has increased more than one-
and-a-half times.  Although immigration is the smallest component of recent population change,
it is still contributing to population expansion.<p>

<b>POPULATION PROJECTION</b><br>
The 1997 Census Bureau population projection has Minnesota's population growing by 20%
between 1995 and 2025 (to 5,510,000).  That is slightly below the national median rate of
increase.  <p>

The Census Bureau population projection noted above is the "middle" projection, and it assumes
immigration at a net annual increase of 820,000.  There are other projections based on different
assumptions.  In the Census Bureau's "high" immigration projection, assuming annual net
immigration of 1,370,000, the population in 2025 is more than six percent higher than in the
middle projection, and it is over 11 percent higher by 2050.  For Minnesota, the high projection
could mean a population in 2050 of 6,800,000 to 7,400,000.  If immigration were
significantly scaled back, the population increase attributable to immigration and the
population spill-over effects from other states could be significantly reduced over time.  See <a
href="04109604.htm">Immigration and Population Growth</a></font><p>

<b>INS DATA ON IMMIGRANT SETTLEMENT</b><br>
Immigrant settlement in Minnesota has risen since 
the adoption of the current immigration system in 1965.  Recent average settlement has been more than three-fold the level of the late 1960s.<p>  
<center><tr><td width=500><img src="stateimg/mnins.gif" border=0 alt=""></td></center><p>

 Legal immigrant settlement in Minnesota since 1990 has averaged over 7,600 per year.  The data
for fiscal year (FY) 1991 were artificially raised by the inclusion of some of the former illegal
aliens who were amnestied in 1986.  
  Just among the long-term resident amnesty applicants (excluding the amnestied agricultural workers), the number applying from Minnesota was 1,106.  

The data for FY'95, FY'97 and FY'98 were artificially low because
the INS was not able to issue green cards to all the applicants for adjustment of status who
were already in the United States.  In those three years, new immigration could have registered
as much as 30 percent higher, if the INS had issued more visas.<p>

Detailed tables that provide INS data for legal immigrant settlement in Minnesota for fiscal years
1991-97 and connections for additional information on the new arrivals by nationality are
available below:

The principal countries of immigration were Vietnam, the former Soviet Union  and China
(including Hong Kong and Taiwan).  Their respective shares of the seven-year total are 10.9
percent, 8.7 percent, and 6.4 percent.<p>

<b>INS ESTIMATE OF ALIENS ELIGIBLE FOR CITIZENSHIP</b><br>
The INS estimates that as of April 1996 there were about 77,000 legal resident aliens in
Minnesota -- legal immigrants who had not yet become U.S. citizens -- of whom
40,000 had met the residency requirement to apply for citizenship.  Included in this number
could be aliens who had already applied for naturalization and were in the processing waiting
list.  The INS offices that handle naturalization cases and fingerprinting are located

<b>FOREIGN STUDENTS</b><br>
The 1997/98 annual report of the Institute of International Education shows a 5.1% increase in
foreign students attending U.S. colleges and universities (481,280) over a year earlier. 
Minnesota's Twin City campus in Minneapolis had the 18th largest number of foreign students in
the country, i.e., 2,651.<p>

<b> ENFORCEMENT AGAINST ILLEGAL WORKERS </b><br>
The INS estimates that in October 1996 there were 7,200 illegal aliens resident in Minnesota. 
This estimate is about 25% higher than the INS estimate of illegal workers in the state in October
1992.  The Center for Immigration Studies, estimates the number of illegal alien residents in the
state to be as high as 25,000, based on the number of illegal aliens resident there when the
amnesty for illegal aliens was enacted in 1986. <p>

<a name="1202">The surging illegal alien problem in Minnesota is described in the following terms by Curtis Aljets, the INS District Director:
 "The number of illegal aliens in the state of Minnesota has increased substantially over a disconcertingly short period of time and this increase has the net effect of (1) keeping the wage rate below that considered by some to be a "living wage", (2) extensively burdening the state infrastructure (i.e., schools, medical care, law enforcement), and (3) contributing to unsafe working conditions."  
The INS "...is prohibited by Court Order from conducting routine verifications of the status of aliens for entities such as employers, with the exception being those cases where an employer can indicate a reason for suspecting a document submitted by an alien worker to be counterfeit or fraudulent.  
...Minnesota is the exception to most other states in the nation by opting to not participate in the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program; this leaves the state vulnerable to the use of counterfeit documents used by illegal aliens to obtain welfare benefits as well as employment.  
Recently arrested aliens indicate during interview that they entered the United States destined for Minnesota for these economic reasons."  
Aljets notes that a set of false documents "...can be purchased in the Minneapolis area for $50.00."  
He also notes that "The number of aliens involved in criminal activities in our communities is increasing rapidly and contributes to the crowding of jails and prisons."

In late July and August 1996, the INS and other agencies identified 243 illegal aliens working in
Minnesota.  Nearly all of the aliens were from Mexico (97%) or Central America.  The
enforcement effort was conducted in 13 central states, and Minnesota accounted for the third
highest number of work site apprehensions after Texas and New Mexico. <br>

The largest-ever immigration raid in Minnesota led to the apprehension of 138 illegal alien
workers at a 400-employee nursery in Newport, Minnesota.  Most of the unauthorized workers
used false documents to get their jobs. <br>

In January, 23 Central and South Americans were apprehended by the INS in a raid at the
Cossetta's restaurant in St. Paul.  In May, a Mexican alien smuggler was apprehended and
returned to Mexico despite the fact that he faced smuggling charges in U.S. District Court in
Minneapolis.  Also in May, the INS checked for green cards at several Minneapolis parks and
found 26 illegal aliens playing volleyball.  In all of fiscal year 1997 (ending September 30) the
St.Paul district INS office -- that has jurisdiction for Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota
-- apprehended a total of 1,626 illegal aliens, up from 405 in 1990.<br>

As a result of a van breaking down in Lakeville on May 7, authorities arrested two Mexicans
who were smuggling 19 Ecuadorans to job sites in Minnesota and New York.  A federal grand
jury handed down indictments for the two smugglers on June 3, and the Ecuadorans are awaiting
deportation.  According to the INS, the number of illegal aliens being detained in Minnesota has
increased in the past two years.<br>

On May 27 the INS raided several Minneapolis parks and apprehended 26 illegal aliens. 
Twenty-five were removed from the country.  Since then, a coalition of church and community
groups calling itself the Joint Committee on Immigration Campaign to Preserve Immigrant
Families has been demanding that the INS to limit its immigration law enforcement
activities.<br>

<a name="115">The general manager of a Holiday Inn in downtown Minneapolis caused a furor when he called the INS on October 13, 1999 to report illegal aliens working on the staff.  
The INS staged a raid and apprehended eight housekeepers.  
The controversy arose from the fact that the action took place about a month and a half after the hotel workers had voted to form a union, and just before collective bargaining was to begin.  
The manager said the call to the INS came because he had just learned that the workers were unauthorized and the hotel risked a fine for their employment. <br>
