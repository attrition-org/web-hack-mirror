      <p>Based in Washington, D.C., the Government Affairs Office serves as a link between UNCF
      institutions, the federal government and professional organizations located in the
      nation's capital. </p>
      <p>The office is responsible for reviewing legislative matters that impact black colleges
      and universities and serves as a liaison for program development with federal government
      agencies. The office also serves as an information resource disseminating critical
      information to UNCF member institutions, the Congress, federal agencies and others. </p>
      <p>UNCF's Government Affairs Office insures that private black colleges and universities
      have a voice in federal policy making and program planning. </p>
      <h3>Review of Federal and Regulatory Action Regarding Private Black Higher Education</h3>
      <p>By carefully monitoring Congressional legislation, especially higher education issues
      related to student and institutional aid, the Government Affairs Office and UNCF member
      institutions are able to respond effectively to actions affecting black higher education. </p>
      <p>As part of this advocacy function, the Government Affairs staff lends research support
      when UNCF member presidents are invited to testify before Congressional committees. The
      research focuses on the specific issue under consideration and provides a complete
      analysis which explores competing views. </p>
      <p>The office also drafts legislation beneficial to member institutions and provides
      recommended language to members of Congress on proposed bills impacting UNCF institutions
      and Students. </p>
      <p>Finally, Government Affairs encourages lawmakers to support minority education concerns
      in all areas of federal jurisdiction. </p>
      <h3>Liaison with Executive Agencies -</h3>
      <p>Government Affairs has expanded its goals to actively seek new partnerships while
      strengthening existing relationships with various federal agencies. The goal is to
      establish cooperative funding agreements to benefit member institutions. The College Fund
      has received grants from the Department of Energy for energy conservation, the Department
      of Health and Human Services for gerontology curricula, the Department of Labor for
      technical assistance, the National Endowment for the Humanities for archival work, and the
      Agency for International Development (A.I.D.) to provide greater program involvement of
      minority colleges in A.I.D. funding. </p>
      <h3>Liaison with Higher Education Organizations -</h3>
      <p>Government Affairs maintains an ongoing dialogue with special interest groups and high
      education assistance organizations. Government Affairs is a member of the American Council
      on Education, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the
      Independent Sector and the Pell Grant Coalition. </p>
      <p>In conjunction with these groups, UNCF works to present a unified response to federal
      legislation whenever possible. This coalition strategy, which also involves coordinating
      with a network of Congressional staffers, higher education officials and minority group
      leaders, strengthens Government Affairs' advocacy role in the legislative policy arena. </p>
      <h3>Information Resource Center For Federal Action -</h3>
      <p>The Government Affairs Office serves as a resource clearinghouse to disseminate
      information relevant to black colleges and universities. It informs member institutions,
      as well as other educational organizations, of legislative and regulatory activities.
      Congress, UNCF staff and alumni, Board of Directors and other interested parties also
      receive this information. </p>
