<p><font size="4">Founded by Dr. Jules 
Stein in 1960, RPB has been identified with virtually every major scientific 
advance in eye research. RPB conducted the first and only exhaustive survey of 
eye research in the U.S. and sponsored the first public opinion poll indicating 
that Americans fear blindness more than any other disability. The organization 
spearheaded efforts to establish the National Eye Institute (NEI) and was a 
major influence in stimulating legislative interest and support on its 
behalf.</font> </p>

<p><font size="4">Since its founding, RPB 
has channeled $166 million into eye research at medical institutions throughout 
the U.S. It financed initial efforts to adapt the laser for use in ophthalmology 
and fostered development of new drugs that prevent blindness and intraocular 
lenses used in cataract surgery that help improve and/or restore vision to more 
than one million Americans each year. RPB has helped create eye institutes in 
every geographical area of the country to conduct research, enhance ophthalmic 
education and provide improved vision care.</font>
