        <p><font size="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif">Washington, D.C., April 28,
        1999&#151;Today, Robert D. German, a member of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation
        International Board of Directors, presented the following testimony before the House
        Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies regarding fiscal year
        2000 appropriations for VA Medical Research and NASA Office of Life and Microgravity
        Science and Applications</font></p>
        <hr width="90%">
        <p>Good afternoon. My name is Rob German, and I am an attorney with the law firm of
        Sherrard, German &amp; Kelly in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I appear before you on behalf of
        the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International (JDF), where I serve as a member of its
        Board of Directors, to testify in support of fiscal year 2000 appropriations for the
        Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical research programs and the National Aeronautics
        and Space Administration&#146;s (NASA) Office of Life and Microgravity Science and
        Applications. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JDF&#146;s mission is to find a cure for diabetes and its
        complications through the support of research. It is the world&#146;s leading
        nongovernmental, nonprofit supporter of diabetes research. This fiscal year, JDF expects
        to support more than $55 million in diabetes research. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although JDF is a research funding organization, I am not a
        scientist. I appear before you today as a dad. I have been an active JDF volunteer since
        my son, Christopher, came down with the disease almost eleven years ago. I am happy to
        report that my son, who is almost seventeen years of age, is surviving his
        diabetes&#151;but that is all that he is doing when it comes to his diabetes! </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher pricks his finger to test his blood sugar five to
        six times a day and is injecting himself with insulin an average of four times a day. His
        daily food intake is extremely regimented as to type, amount and when it must be eaten.
        Christopher does this everyday of his life in an effort to keep his blood sugar levels
        within acceptable ranges in an effort to try to reduce the risk of future significant
        medical problems brought on by the disease. Those potential medical problems include
        blindness, kidney failure, heart disease, stroke, and amputations. Christopher never gets
        a day off from diabetes. You can imagine how difficult this lifestyle would be for anyone
        to maintain, especially an active teenager. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals with diabetes face many hurdles in dealing with
        their health beyond even the day-to-day difficulties of living with the illness. A perfect
        example is an upcoming wisdom tooth removal. Most people can have their wisdom teeth
        extracted as an outpatient and be home within several hours. Unfortunately, Chris must be
        hospitalized for two to three days so that his blood sugar levels can be properly
        maintained in the absence of certain food. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtually every JDF parent has made the same promise to his or
        her child&#151;to do everything possible to find a cure for diabetes and its
        complications. JDF is doing its share to support this effort, and we seek the enhanced
        help of the federal government&#151;and your commitment as well&#151;to help speed our
        path to a cure. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JDF places a great deal of attention on the important diabetes
        research programs within the National Institutes of Health, where the bulk of federally
        supported diabetes research is carried out. Less well known is our support for the
        diabetes research programs within VA and NASA. </p>
        <p><b>JDF/VA Partnerships</b> <br>
        Diabetes is a great strain on the VA health-care system. The VA estimates that 15 percent
        of all veterans suffer from diabetes (compared to 3.1 percent of the general population
        and 8 percent of the Medicare population), and nearly 25 percent of all pharmacy
        outpatient costs are attributable to persons with diabetes. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JDF established public&#150;private research partnerships with
        the VA in 1996 to further advance our mutual interests in curing diabetes and its
        complications. So far, our partnership has resulted in diabetes research centers in Iowa
        City, Nashville, and San Diego, and we are working with the VA to identify additional
        projects that would be appropriate for joint funding. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within our centers, we are developing new strategies to help
        veterans&#151;and all Americans&#151;help battle the devastating complications of
        diabetes. In particular, current and future JDF/VA partnerships will focus on new
        treatments to help veterans who suffer from complications such as heart disease,
        blindness, kidney failure, and nerve damage. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman, we hope the Subcommittee will support the Friends
        of the VA Medical Care and Health Research coalition&#146;s request for $360 million for
        VA Medical and Prosthetics research. This would provide a $44 million increase in funding
        over last year&#146;s budget, and it would allow the VA to maintain existing projects and
        expand research into diabetes and other fields. </p>
        <p><b>NASA Diabetes Research</b> <br>
        JDF is working with NASA to advance our understanding of diabetes and to develop new
        treatments. NASA&#146;s Office of Life and Microgravity Science and Applications
        undertakes research projects that are relevant to issues affecting the diagnosis and
        treatment of diabetes and its complications. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the research areas of mutual interest to JDF and NASA are
        the following: <ul>
          <li><i>Diabetic Retinopathy:</i> Diabetes is the leading cause of new adult blindness. NASA
            is developing new techniques that will permit early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy
            suitable for mass screening. In addition, JDF and NASA recently cosponsored a major
            national <a href="news033099.html">research conference</a> on issues relating to
            diabetic retinopathy research. </li>
          <li><i>Noninvasive Blood Glucose Monitoring:</i> NASA is searching for ways to allow its
            astronauts to avoid invasive procedures for testing their blood. My son, Christopher,
            tests his blood sugar multiple times each day. If we can develop non-invasive
            technologies, it will aid individuals with diabetes in day-to-day blood sugar control as
            well as assist astronauts in space. </li>
          <li><i>NASA Bioreactor Program:</i> NASA maintains a bioreactor that is showing great
            promise in helping us understand more about the biology of insulin-producing beta cells.
            In addition, the bioreactor is helping us study ways that insulin-producing cells can
            replicate in microgravity environments, which we hope will provide us with an endless
            source of such cells for eventual transplantation in persons with diabetes. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman, we are requesting $300 million for NASA&#146;s
        Office of Life and Microgravity Science and Applications program, an increase of $36
        million over last year&#146;s funding level. </p>
        <p><b>Summary</b> <br>
        Mr. Chairman, thank you once again for the opportunity to testify before you today. We
        believe that the work of the VA and NASA in diabetes research will help speed the path to
        a cure for diabetes, and we thank you for your strong support. </p>
