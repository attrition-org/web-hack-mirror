        <p><font size="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif">Washington, D.C., March 30,
        1999&#151;</font>Today, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) and the National
        Aeronautics &amp; Space Administration (NASA) begin a two-day workshop on the latest in
        diabetic retinopathy&#151;the leading cause of adult blindness in the U.S. This
        workshop&#146;s program will provide a forum for discussion and review of state-of-the-art
        diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of diabetic retinopathy and for setting future
        directions for diabetic retinopathy research. The workshop will also include discussion of
        how to use measures in the eye as a means to monitor diabetes in patients. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workshop&#151;co-sponsored by JDF and NASA in collaboration
        with the National Eye Institute (NEI), National Institute on Diabetes and Digestive and
        Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), and the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke
        (NINDS)&#151;brings together leading clinical researchers, scientists, engineers, and
        representatives of universities, businesses, federal laboratories, and other agencies.
        Research Triangle Institute (RTI) is helping plan and conduct the workshop. Discussions
        will include focus on six critical areas identified as priorities for research, including
        the development of a low-cost, portable technique for screening people with diabetes for
        eye disease; noninvasive techniques to measure retinal blood flow; techniques for
        high-resolution retinal imaging; techniques for noninvasive compositional analysis within
        the eye; how to enable pervasive digital imaging to replace existing retinal photography;
        and MRI/NMR techniques to be applied to the retina. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diabetic retinopathy is an eye disease characterized by vision
        impairment or blindness caused by the leakage of blood and other fluids from retinal blood
        vessels. All people with diabetes are at risk, and approximately 90% will develop some
        degree of retinopathy within their lifetime. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full summary report of the workshop will be available on this
        site in mid-April. For media inquires, please contact Julie Kimbrough, JDF Manager of
        Media Relations (212-479-7536). Further information on the workshop is available at</p>
