        <p><font size="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif">New York, April 1, 1999&#151;</font>The
        Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International (JDF) and Sertoli Technologies (STI) have
        formed a two-year research collaboration aimed at moving STI&#146;s patented cellular
        therapy for Type 1, or insulin-dependent, diabetes rapidly toward preclinical and clinical
        studies. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research program will develop grafts composed of Sertoli
        cells and pancreatic islets for use in transplantation therapy to cure diabetes. Sertoli
        cells, which are obtained from the mammalian testis, produce an array of factors that
        nourish developing sperm and protect them from attack by the immune system. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pancreatic islet cells secrete insulin in response to blood
        sugar levels. A graft consisting of Sertoli cells and islets could simultaneously provide
        insulin-independence and prevent immune rejection. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STI&#146;s initial development of the therapy has shown
        long-term survival of Sertoli cell/islet grafts in both lower and higher animals. The new
        STI&#150;JDF collaboration will develop Sertoli cell/islet allografts&#151;with use of
        tissue from the same species&#151;to cure diabetes in animal and preclinical models. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If successful, this will expedite the beginning of clinical
        trials using human Sertoli cell/islet grafts in patients with Type 1 diabetes. STI and JDF
        will fund the program jointly and may extend and develop their collaboration in the
        future. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past decade, some cases have been reported in which
        transplanted human islets have rendered diabetic recipients insulin-independent for
        varying periods. In all of these cases, the patients required chronic immunosuppression to
        prevent destruction of the islets by their immune system. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STI&#146;s novel cellular therapy is attractive because it has
        the potential to allow islet transplantation into people with Type 1, or juvenile,
        diabetes without lifelong systemic immunosuppression. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Our review committee noted the novel and innovative
        approach taken by STI, and we look forward to working with STI to find a cure for
        diabetes&#151;a disease that kills one American every three minutes,&#148; said Dr. Robert
        Goldstein, vice president of research at JDF. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998 alone, JDF awarded more than 200 research grants and
        over 110 fellowship and career develop awards to scientists in 17 countries throughout the
        world. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STI is developing breakthrough technology that could make
        cellular therapy a commercial reality. The STI technology could be the basis for several
        potential implant products that can survive without the need for lifelong antirejection
        drugs. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STI and JDF will implement their collaborative program through
        two teams of researchers at the Carolinas Medical Center (CMC) in Charlotte, N.C. and the
        University of Alberta (U of A) in Edmonton, Canada. Paul F. Gores, M.D., director of
        pancreas/islet transplantation at CMC Craig Halberstadt, Ph.D., director of tissue
        engineering at CMC, and Ray V. Rajotte, Ph.D., director of the U of A Surgical-Medical
        Research Institute and Gregory S. Korbutt, Ph.D., assistant professor of surgery, head
        STI&#146;s multidisciplinary research team. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These teams have been working with STI over the past several
        years to extend the early results of Dr. Helena Selawry, formerly at the University of
        Tennessee Medical Center and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Memphis, who first
        discovered the immunoregulating properties of Sertoli cells. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Our financial and scientific collaboration with JDF will
        build on our promising results from the laboratories at CMC and the U of A,&#148; said STI
        President Shaun Kirkpatrick. &#147;The recognition and support from this international
        diabetes organization will significantly improve the likelihood that our product will have
        an impact on diabetes.&#148; </p>
