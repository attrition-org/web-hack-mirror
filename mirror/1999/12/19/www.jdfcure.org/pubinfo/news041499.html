        <p><font size="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif">New York, April 14, 1999&#151;</font>The
        Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International (JDF) will honor Michael Greene, President and
        CEO of the Recording Academy at JDF&#146;s Fifth Annual Music Industry Dinner tonight at
        the Sheraton New York Hotel &amp; Towers. Performances by Anita Baker and Tony Bennett,
        eight-time GRAMMY winners, will highlight the black-tie event held to raise funds to find
        a cure for diabetes and its complications. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;The JDF is a very special organization with the most
        noble of missions, helping children,&#148; said Michael Greene. &#147;I am pleased that so
        many music friends will be on hand to enjoy the great performances by Anita and Tony.
        Music people are always among the first to try and better the human condition. I&#146;m
        fortunate just to play a small part in such a great evening for such a worthy cause.&#148;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Greene has had a long involvement with charitable causes.
        Currently, he serves as President of the NARAS Foundation&#151;dedicated to advancing
        music education in schools and ensuring access to a rich cultural legacy&#151;and
        MusiCares Foundation, which provides outreach, educational, and financial assistance to
        music people in need, and as the National Corporate Spokesman for the American Music
        Therapy Association. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;We at JDF are very grateful to have Michael Greene as our
        honoree this year,&#148; said Dr. James E. Mulvihill, President &amp; CEO of JDF.
        &#147;His presence here tonight will not only help us raise funds for diabetes research,
        but will help us raise awareness for this debilitating disease, which affects 16 million
        Americans and kills one of us every three minutes.&#148; </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past five years, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation
        International has been honoring outstanding leaders in the music industry to help raise
        funds to find a cure for diabetes and its complications. Since 1993, this event has raised
        over $1.7 million for diabetes research. Past honorees included Bruce Lundvall, President
        of Blue Note Records (1997); Keith Clinkscales, President &amp; CEO of Vibe Magazine, and
        Lydia Cole, Vice President of Black Entertainment Television (1996); Russell Simmons, CEO
        of Rush Communications, and Andrea Harrell, President &amp; CEO of Uptown Entertainment
        (1994); and Jheryl Busby, President &amp; CEO of Motown Records, and Dick Scott, President
        of Dick Scott Entertainment (1993). </p>
