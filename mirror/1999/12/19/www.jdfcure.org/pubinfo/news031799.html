        <p><font size="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif">New York, March 17, 1999&#151;</font>The
        Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International (JDF) is pleased to announce Donald B. Marron,
        chairman and chief executive officer of Paine Webber Group Inc., as its 1999 &#147;Man of
        the Year.&#148; Mr. Marron will be honored at a black-tie dinner on March 18th at the
        Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. Mary Tyler Moore, International Chairman of JDF,
        will present the award.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JDF&#146;s &#147;Man of the Year&#148; dinner was initiated in
        1985 to acknowledge the contributions made to diabetes research by outstanding individuals
        in the private sector. Mr. Marron heads one of the largest U.S. investment firms. His
        participation in this event has helped JDF raise $1.5 million to find a cure for diabetes
        and its complications. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;It is a privilege to be honored as &#145;Man of the
        Year&#146; by JDF, the organization leading the way in finding a cure for a debilitating
        disease affecting more than 16 million Americans,&#148; Mr. Marron said. &#147;All of us
        at Paine Webber are committed to making a difference in the communities we serve.&#148; </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Marron has served as chairman and chief executive officer
        of Paine Webber Group since 1981. Throughout his career he has held leadership positions
        in the industry and community. Previously, he was the director of the New York Stock
        Exchange, and governor, vice chairman, and a member of the executive committee of the
        Securities Industry Association. Currently, he is a private sector co-chairman of the
        National Commission on Retirement Policy and is a member of the board of governors of the
        National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). Mr. Marron also has a longstanding
        leadership role in philanthropy and has worked tirelessly to help a diverse group of
        non-profit organizations focusing on medical research, children&#146;s advocacy, and the
        arts. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Over the last several years, Donald Marron, a true friend
        of JDF, has dedicated himself and Paine Webber to helping us find a cure for diabetes and
        its complications,&#148; said John J. McDonough, Chairman of the Board of JDF. &#147;Since
        1995 Paine Webber and its employees have raised over $3 million for our annual Walk to
        Cure Diabetes, and we are truly honored to have Don leading that charge.&#148; </p>
