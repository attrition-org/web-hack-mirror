        <ul>
          <li>JDF gives more resources to diabetes research than any other nonprofit, nongovernmental
            organization in the world. </li>
          <li>Since its founding in 1970, JDF has given more than $290 million to diabetes research. </li>
          <li>In 1998&#150;1999, JDF will award more than $50 million to diabetes research worldwide,
            $65 million the next year, and by 2003, anticipates awarding more than $100 million
            annually. </li>
          <li>Through our research funding, JDF has been instrumental in establishing a focus on the
            needs of people with diabetes, which has helped set the world diabetes research agenda. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cutting-Edge Research</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>JDF has three research goals: restoring normal blood glucose, preventing and reversing
            diabetes-related complications, and preventing diabetes and its recurrence. </li>
          <li>In 1998, a JDF Research Task Force developed a unique mapping process, which spotlighted
            gaps in diabetes research for finding a cure for the disease and its complications. </li>
          <li>Through its unique peer and lay review system, JDF funds the most innovative,
            cutting-edge research worldwide. This year alone, more than 200 research grants and over
            110 fellowship and career development awards were granted to scientists in 17 countries
            throughout the world. </li>
          <li>JDF played a key role in creating a Congressionally mandated Diabetes Research Working
            Group, which will present to Congress early next year a comprehensive plan to cure
            diabetes. </li>
          <li>JDF creates multidisciplinary programs that bring leading diabetes researchers together
            with scientists from many institutions and such diverse disciplines as molecular biology
            and genetics, immunology, transplantation, and vascular biology to find a cure for
            diabetes and its complications. </li>
          <li>As part of its research focus, JDF accepts applications from institutions to develop
            multidisciplinary centers to focus on key strategies to find a cure. One such center is
            the new $20 million JDF Center for Islet Cell Transplantation at Harvard Medical School.
            The Center opened in September 1998 and brings together 32 researchers from 9
            Harvard-affiliated institutions. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Leveraging Research Funds</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In 28 years, JDF has been instrumental in encouraging the National Institutes of Health
            (NIH) to increase diabetes research funding from $18 million to $415 million annually. </li>
          <li>JDF has leveraged its research impact by stimulating increased research spending on the
            part of other public and private entities such as the Department of Veterans Affairs. </li>
          <li>In 1990, JDF pioneered public/private partnerships that combine government funding with
            JDF resources. <i>The Only Remedy Is a Cure Campaign,</i> the international major gift
            initiative that created these partnerships, has raised over $125 million, which added to
            the $57 million from the U.S. and other governments, totals $182 million towards our $200
            million goal. </li>
          <li>In our mission to find a cure, we collaborate with all diabetes stakeholders, including
            individuals with diabetes and their families; world-leading diabetes researchers and
            academic institutions; foundations, corporate partners, individual donors, and volunteers;
            government agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National
            Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the
            Medical Research Councils of Australia, Canada, and Sweden; and biotech/pharmaceutical
            industries. </li>
