        <p><font size="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif">New York, April 15, 1999&#151;</font>Former
        House Speaker Newt Gingrich was honored in grand fashion by celebrities, friends, and
        family at a gala&#151;&#147;Salute to Newt&#148;&#151;at the Capitol Hilton on Wednesday,
        April 14, 1999. The celebrants gathered to applaud his historic accomplishments and help
        launch him into his new career. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &#147;Salute to Newt&#148; was sponsored by the Friends of
        Newt Gingrich Political Action Committee (PAC). A portion of the proceeds was donated to
        one of Speaker Gingrich&#146;s favorite organizations, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation
        International. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary Tyler Moore, International Chairman of the Juvenile
        Diabetes Foundation, introduced Speaker Gingrich: &#147;I&#146;m thrilled to be
        participating in the &#145;Salute to Newt&#146;&#148; Moore said. &#147;Newt deserves our
        praise and recognition, especially for his leadership in championing the cause of medical
        research. During his tenure as Speaker, he helped tens of millions of people suffering
        from debilitating diseases like diabetes, and we are truly grateful.&#148;</p>
        <p>Charlton Heston and Jay Leno honored the former Speaker with video salutes. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Hollywood celebrities were joined by hundreds of
        Washington &#147;celebrities,&#148; eager to show their appreciation for Gingrich and his
        accomplishments. In addition to many of the close friends he made in the world of politics
        during his career, there were over one hundred Members of Congress in attendance,
        including Speaker of the House Denny Hastret, Majority Leader Dick Armey, Majority Whip
        Tom DeLay, Republican Conference Chairman J.C. Watts, and Conference Secretary Tillie
        Fowler. </p>
