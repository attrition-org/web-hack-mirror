        <p><b><font size="+1">The Challenge</font></b> </p>
        <p>Sixteen million people in the United States have diabetes mellitus. In both human and
        economic terms, it is one of our nation&#146;s most costly diseases. Diabetes is the
        leading cause of kidney failure, blindness in adults, and amputations. It is a major risk
        factor for heart disease, stroke, and birth defects, shortens average life expectancy by
        up to 15 years, and costs the nation in excess of $100 billion annually in health-related
        expenditures. At present, more than one of every ten health-care dollars and about one of
        every four Medicare dollars are spent on people with diabetes. Over the next decade these
        numbers will grow as the number of people afflicted by diabetes continues to increase at
        an accelerating rate. At present, there is no method to prevent or cure diabetes, and
        available treatments have only limited success in controlling its devastating
        consequences. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem is made more complex by the fact that diabetes
        mellitus is not a single disease, but occurs in several forms, and has complications that
        affect virtually every system of the body. The most common forms are Type 1
        (insulin-dependent) diabetes, which usually starts in childhood or adolescence, and Type 2
        (non-insulin dependent) diabetes, which typically affects adults and increases
        dramatically with age and obesity. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress has clearly recognized the gravity of diabetes through
        the establishment of a bipartisan Diabetes Caucus and has concluded that the only way to
        reduce the tremendous burden of this disease is through intensified biomedical research.
        Over the past three years, Congress has emphasized diabetes research in funding increases
        provided to the NIH and through other special initiatives. Realizing the critical need to
        build upon these important steps, the Congress directed the establishment of the Diabetes
        Research Working Group (DRWG) and charged it with developing a comprehensive plan for
        diabetes research. This plan is intended to help increase the effectiveness of NIH-funded
        diabetes research and find solutions to the extremely serious problems posed by this
        disease. During 1998, the DRWG and its subcommittees held a series of meetings, consulted
        with a wide range of experts in the field, and heard public commentary. It evaluated all
        aspects of the diabetes problem in an effort to develop a comprehensive plan for
        submission to the Congress. This document summarizes the Strategic Research Plan of the
        Diabetes Research Working Group. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on its extensive review and deliberations, the DRWG
        recognizes both great urgency and unprecedented opportunities in diabetes research. The
        seriousness of the disease and the widespread problems associated with it demand
        accelerated and expanded research programs, not only to discover the means to prevent and
        cure diabetes, but also to develop better and more effective treatment strategies. Meeting
        these challenges requires a well-thought-out and continuously updated research plan; a
        cadre of talented researchers and physician-scientists; a supportive infrastructure; and
        appropriate budgetary resources. The DRWG is convinced that taking action now to increase
        significantly NIH support of diabetes research will save many thousands of men, women and
        children from the severe consequences of a dangerous, often disabling and potentially even
        fatal illness, and will also save the nation many billions of dollars in medical care and
        lost productivity. From both human and scientific perspectives, now is the time for the
        United States to move swiftly and decisively to begin to ensure a future for America
        without diabetes. </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Magnitude of the Problem</font></b> </p>
        <p>The magnitude of the problem created by diabetes is clearly defined by a few simple
        facts: <ul>
          <li>Diabetes currently affects an estimated 16 million Americans, and about 800,000 new
            cases are diagnosed each year. </li>
          <li>Diabetes spares no group&#151;attacking men, women, children, the elderly and people
            from every racial background. <ul>
              <li>African, Hispanic, Native and Asian Americans, some of the fastest growing segments of
                the U.S. population, are particularly vulnerable to diabetes and its most severe
                complications. </li>
              <li>Diabetes strikes both ends of the age continuum. Children and young adults with Type 1
                diabetes face a lifetime of daily insulin injections and the possibility of early
                complications whose severity will likely increase with duration. Elderly diabetics are
                frequently debilitated by multiple complications. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Diabetes affects virtually every tissue of the body with long term and severe damage. <ul>
              <li>Diabetic eye disease (retinopathy) is the most common cause of blindness in working age
                adults. </li>
              <li>Diabetic kidney disease (nephropathy) accounts for 42 percent of new cases of end-stage
                renal disease, and is the fastest growing cause of kidney dialysis and transplantation
                (over 100,000 cases per year). </li>
              <li>Nervous system damage (neuropathy) affects over 60 percent of diabetics, causing
                impaired sensation or pain in the feet or hands, slowed digestion of food in the stomach,
                impotence, and other problems. </li>
              <li>More than half of lower limb amputations in the United States occur among people with
                diabetes. From 1993 to 1995, about 80,000 amputations were performed each year on people
                with diabetes. </li>
              <li>Heart disease death rates in adults with diabetes are about 2 to 4 times those of people
                without diabetes. Premenopausal women lose their protection from heart disease and have
                even more markedly increased risk. </li>
              <li>High blood pressure affects over 60 percent of people with diabetes. As a result of the
                combination of hypertension and diabetes the risk of stroke is increased 2 to 4 times.</li>
              <li>Pregnancy related problems confront diabetic women. The rate of major congenital
                malformations and death of the fetus and newborn are increased 3 to 4 times. </li>
              <li>Higher rates of infection, periodontal disease, and many other problems occur in people
                with diabetes. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death due to disease in the U.S., and the third
            leading cause in some minority groups. <ul>
              <li>Since 1980, the age-adjusted death rate due to diabetes has increased by 30 percent
                while the death rate has fallen for other common multifactorial diseases, such as
                cardiovascular disease and stroke. </li>
              <li>Life expectancy of people with diabetes averages 10 to 15 years less than that in the
                general population. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The economic impact of diabetes is staggering. <ul>
              <li>The cost of diabetes to the nation is over $105 billion annually. </li>
              <li>More than one of every ten U.S. healthcare dollars is spent for diabetes. </li>
              <li>One of about four Medicare dollars pays for health care of people with diabetes. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Federal Investment in Diabetes Research</font></b> </p>
        <p>Reducing the tremendous health and human burden of diabetes and its enormous economic
        toll depends upon identifying the factors responsible for the disease and developing new
        methods for treatment and prevention. These advances can only occur through increased
        biomedical research. Although Federal support for diabetes research has produced a number
        of major advances in the past two decades, many scientific opportunities are not being
        pursued due to insufficient funding, lack of appropriate mechanisms, and a shortage of
        trained researchers. Improvements in technology and the general growth in scientific
        knowledge offer unprecedented opportunities for advances that might lead to better
        treatments, prevention and possibly cure. Unfortunately, the current funding, level of
        effort, and scope of diabetes research fall far short of what is needed to capitalize on
        these opportunities. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Government, through the National Institutes of Health
        (NIH), will spend an estimated $443 million in FY 1999 on diabetes-related research. While
        this amount has steadily increased since 1981, there is unanimous agreement in the DRWG
        that this funding level is far short of what is required to make progress on this complex
        and difficult problem. In fact, the current federal budget for diabetes research
        represents less than one-half of one percent (0.5 percent) of the annual cost of diabetes
        to the U.S. economy. When compared with the 5 to 15 percent budgets for research and
        development in other high-technology sectors, the investment in diabetes research is
        trivial. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting the challenges posed by diabetes requires investment of
        additional resources to conduct the needed research and a well-conceived, comprehensive
        research plan for its effective use. This Plan by the DRWG is the first step in this
        direction. </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">The Research Plan</font></b> </p>
        <p>The Diabetes Research Working Group is convinced that a significant investment in
        research today will greatly speed progress in understanding and conquering this disease
        and its complications. The Strategic Research Plan set forth has two overarching goals: <ul>
          <li>Understand the causes and define approaches to prevent the development of Type 1 and
            Type 2 diabetes and their complications. </li>
          <li>Develop methods for optimal management, treatment and ultimate cure of diabetes and its
            complications. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DRWG has divided this Research Plan into the following
        three major components, and provided specific recommendations concerning the types of
        efforts, budgetary requirements and program mechanisms that should be pursued to realize
        compelling research goals: <ul>
          <li>Extraordinary Opportunities: Rapidly expanding, crosscutting areas in which increased
            investment or development of new mechanisms will significantly speed research. </li>
          <li>Special Needs for Special Problems: Equally important, but more focused research areas
            targeted to specific populations, complications, and methodological approaches. </li>
          <li>Resource and Infrastructural Needs: A bold plan for increasing research manpower,
            technology and other infrastructure elements for diabetes-related research. </li>

        genetics of diabetes and its complications; autoimmunity and the beta cell; cell signaling
        and cell regulation; obesity; and clinical research and clinical trials of critical
        importance. </p>
        <p><b>Genetics of Diabetes</b> </p>
        <p>Because Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and their complications have strong genetic
        determinants, defining the specific genes involved is essential to prevention and could
        lead to new and better therapies. Defining the genes for diabetes and its complications
        will also help isolate the environmental factors involved in the disease and may identify
        genetic factors that contribute to variations in response to medications. Thus, a major
        goal for the coming decade must be to identify these predisposing genes. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most of the basic tools for genetic studies are in
        place and much progress has been made, current approaches are inadequate to tackle the
        vital genetics questions in a reasonable time frame. Three major impediments are
        inadequate resources; the lack of an appropriate mechanism to bring together the groups of
        researchers and patient samples to conduct the necessary studies; and fragmented genetic
        repositories. </p>
        <p><b>Recommendations:</b> <ul>
          <li>Establish a National Consortium for the Study of the Genetics of Diabetes to create a
            strong, coordinated effort for analysis of the role of genetics in diabetes and its
            complications. </li>
          <li>Enhance research in laboratory animals and humans to discover the biochemical mechanisms
            by which diabetes genes function to create susceptibility to diabetes and its
            complications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Autoimmunity and the Beta Cell</b> </p>
        <p>Type 1 diabetes is an &#147;autoimmune&#148; disease in which the body&#146;s own
        defense system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells of the
        pancreas. Important discoveries and concepts have emerged during the past decade from
        research in basic immunology, cell biology, and autoimmune diseases, including Type 1
        diabetes. Based on this solid research foundation, the DRWG believes that aggressive
        pursuit of three scientific areas over the next decade could lead to dramatic improvements
        in diabetes therapy and prevention. </p>
        <p><b>Recommendations:</b> <ul>
          <li>Define the immunological basis of Type 1 diabetes and develop methods for prevention of
            the disease. <ul>
              <li>Intensify research to understand the immunological basis of Type 1 diabetes. </li>
              <li>Complete mapping of T cell specificity of autoimmune responses to major pancreatic islet
                cell proteins and identify optimal strategies for immunotherapy. </li>
              <li>Expand the scope of efforts to identify immune response markers that reliably detect
                individuals predisposed to Type 1 diabetes in the population at large. </li>
              <li>Conduct additional clinical trials of immunoprevention of Type 1 diabetes using
                antigen-specific, cytokine- or antibody-based immunotherapy. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Advance research on islet cell transplantation for treatment of diabetes. <ul>
              <li>Establish Centers for Islet Transplantation with appropriate funding to undertake
                immediate clinical trials of islet transplantation in patients with Type 1 diabetes and to
                evaluate various methods of immune intervention. </li>
              <li>Support an expanded system for national collection of human pancreas for isolation and
                distribution of islets for clinical studies and clinical trials, and establish a Task
                Force to make recommendations on approaches to enhance this process. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Develop methods to stimulate beta cell growth and regeneration. <ul>
              <li>Increase basic research on the control and regulation of islet cell differentiation,
                growth and development, and devise methods for stimulating growth or regeneration of islet
                cells. </li>
              <li>Create Interdisciplinary Centers for Beta Cell Biology to expand current efforts and
                bring new investigators into the field. These Centers should be applicable to research
                efforts on both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Cell Signaling and Cell Regulation</b> </p>
        <p>Intracellular and intercellular communication is the basic mechanism for the regulation
        of all cells. Disturbances in cell signaling are central to disturbances in insulin
        secretion and action, which lead to diabetes and to both micro- and macrovascular
        complications. Basic research in this area is not only essential to understanding
        diabetes, but is also critical to understanding many diabetes-related complications. Most
        importantly, this type of &#147;discovery&#148; research can identify important targets
        for new treatments. It would also complement the important new information about the
        genetic underpinnings of disease. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent progress in research on signaling systems and in the
        ability to use genetic methods to study these pathways has created an extraordinary
        opportunity to determine the exact mechanisms of signal communication and its alterations
        in diabetes. A parallel opportunity exists to identify the molecular events responsible
        for the insulin resistance characteristic of Type 2 diabetes. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DRWG has identified five areas of opportunity in cell
        signaling and regulation that warrant increased research. These are: dissection of insulin
        and hormone signaling pathways; understanding and countering insulin resistance; defining
        mechanisms regulating beta cell function; metabolic staging of diabetes; and defining
        alterations in signaling pathways that lead to development of diabetes complications. </p>
        <p><b>Recommendations:</b> <ul>
          <li>Complete the dissection of hormone signaling pathways, particularly the pathways of
            insulin action, and define their alterations in diabetes, including insulin resistance. <ul>
              <li>Significantly increase research in the fundamental science of cellular signaling as it
                relates to diabetes and its complications. </li>
              <li>Remove the limits currently present on research project (RO1) and program project (PO1)
                grants, such as budget caps, limitations on growth of programs, and considerations of
                average grant size, to maximize the opportunity for effective research teams to be formed.
              </li>
              <li>Establish research centers to focus on development of methods to study cellular
                signaling at the molecular and genetic level in humans with diabetes to allow correlation
                between the physiological defects and the molecular alterations. </li>
              <li>Expand research to identify the underlying genetic and biochemical basis of insulin
                resistance, and to develop interventions to prevent, reverse and ameliorate it in Type 2
                diabetes and obesity.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Define mechanisms regulating beta cell function and their alterations in Type 2
            diabetes. <ul>
              <li>Increase research on signaling pathways involved in the regulation of normal beta cell
                function and their derangements in diabetes. </li>
              <li>Use the proposed Interdisciplinary Centers for Beta-Cell Biology to study the
                alterations in signaling in Type 2 diabetes.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Allow metabolic staging of diabetes and identify the mechanisms of complications. <ul>
              <li>Develop a program of research to allow metabolic staging of Type 2 diabetes, and to
                detect individuals at high risk for this form of the disease and its complications. </li>
              <li>Expand support of interdisciplinary research to identify the mechanisms of the
                complications of diabetes, including interactive mechanisms and program project grants,
                which bring together investigators with different areas of expertise. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Obesity&#151;Critical in Diabetes and a Major Problem of Its Own</b> </p>
        <p>Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of Type 2 diabetes and insulin
        resistance, as well as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. One of every
        two Americans is overweight, and the prevalence has increased 30 percent in the past
        decade alone. Obesity disproportionately affects minorities. Over 60 percent of African
        American, Mexican American, and Native American women meet the criteria of being
        overweight and between 33 and 37 percent are obese. Moreover, obesity in children and
        adolescents is increasing at alarming rates, leading to occurrence of Type 2 diabetes in
        these groups. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obesity results from an imbalance between energy intake and
        energy expenditure. The recent discovery of the fat cell hormone, leptin, and other
        appetite-regulating hormones has demonstrated that certain types of obesity are not simply
        due to overeating, but are the result of misregulated pathways that control the balance
        between appetite and energy expenditure. These new discoveries have provided a
        revolutionary understanding of obesity at the molecular level, thus leading to
        extraordinary opportunities in biomedical and behavioral research. </p>
        <p><b>Recommendations:</b> <ul>
          <li>Increase the size, scope, number and funding level of NIH sponsored Obesity Research
            Centers to meet appropriately the severity of this problem in the U.S. </li>
          <li>Significantly increase research in the basic sciences underlying obesity to capitalize
            on recent advances in hormonal control of appetite, energy regulation, metabolism, and
            adipocyte development. </li>
          <li>Develop stronger industry-NIH relationships to support obesity-related research. </li>
          <li>Enhance behavioral research in obesity. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Clinical Research and Clinical Trials of Critical Importance</b> </p>
        <p>Translation of basic research into human therapies depends on an active and vigorous
        clinical research program. Studies in test tubes, cells and animals can answer questions
        of fundamental importance, and often provide the basis for development and initial testing
        of potential interventions. However, it is clinical studies in patients with diabetes that
        are essential for validating these observations and their relevance to human disease. In
        addition, clinical studies give key insights into the genetic, immune, hormonal, metabolic
        and environmental factors involved in the disease, and allow true testing of therapeutic
        strategies. Several prevailing forces, however, have significantly hampered clinical
        research and clinical trials in diabetes. Investigator-initiated clinical research is
        decreasing as a result of decreasing numbers of clinical investigators, limitations on
        funding of clinical research, the high cost of clinical research, and the complexity of
        clinical challenges. A major factor hampering clinical trials is the lack of
        infrastructure to organize and support them. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For diabetes, the long-term nature of the complications adds to
        the complexity of clinical trials. In most clinical studies, it is difficult to have
        adequate representation of high-risk minority groups due to the ad hoc nature of the
        organization of clinical trials. For robust and effective clinical research, additional
        well-trained clinical investigators and increased funding of meritorious clinical studies
        are required. Also needed are efficient systems for clinical research to provide the
        necessary numbers of patients and the stability of operations for long-term studies, and
        opportunities to include sufficient numbers of appropriate minority groups. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive program for tackling a major public health
        problem such as diabetes requires a major investment, not only in basic research, but also
        in clinical research and clinical trials. The latter are particularly needed to document
        the safety and efficacy of various therapeutic strategies and generate the knowledge base
        for &#147;evidence based medicine&#148; that will lead to better treatment of diseases.
        There are two major needs to achieve these goals. The first is creation of an
        infrastructure to facilitate clinical trials&#151;both improving efficiency and lowering
        cost. This need is especially apparent in diabetes where clinical trials to &#147;hard
        endpoints&#148; may take many years and even decades. The second need is a commitment to
        using clinical trials as a mechanism to develop the proper base of knowledge and to assure
        steady improvement in the care of people with diabetes. </p>
        <p><b>Recommendations:</b> <ul>
          <li>Establish a national diabetes trial network (Diabetes TrialNet) of cooperative clinical
            research groups to create the stable, high-quality infrastructure necessary for the
            conduct of effective and efficient clinical trials in diabetes. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Diabetes Research Working Group recommends that
            NIH: <ul>
              <li>Increase funding of meritorious clinical trials of emerging new therapies for diabetes
                and its complications. </li>
              <li>Support critical trials on how to most effectively apply the current methods of therapy
                and identify new, more generally applicable methods for achieving tight blood glucose
                control without hypoglycemia. </li>
              <li>Support clinical trials on the prevention of microvascular and macrovascular disease,
                the major causes of morbidity and death in people with diabetes. </li>
              <li>Develop effective partnerships among the NIH, academia and industry for collaboration
                and co-funding of clinical trials in diabetes and to provide training in the science of
                clinical trials. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Increase funding of meritorious clinical research for physiological studies and
            development of new technologies for metabolic assessment. These should include efforts to:
            <ul>
              <li>Initiate clinical studies of promising new therapies for diabetes, such as gene therapy,
                or tissue-specific approaches to microvascular complications. </li>
              <li>Initiate studies to determine the reasons that women and some minority populations with
                diabetes have higher risks for diabetic complications. </li>
              <li>Increase opportunities for and support of clinical research training in diabetes. </li>
              <li>Perform clinical studies to establish and validate surrogate endpoints for the
                complications of diabetes to be used in clinical research and clinical trials. </li>

        </ul>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Special Needs for Special Problems</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>Micro- and Macrovascular Complications</b> </p>
        <p>The different types of diabetes and the array of complications they present offer a
        wide range of specific research needs unique to each. The micro- and macrovascular
        complications of diabetes are responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality in both
        Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Their prevention and reversal will greatly reduce the burden
        of this disease on individuals and on the nation. Understanding and combating the
        complications of diabetes will require significantly expanded research in mechanisms
        involved in the development and progression of the complications of diabetes. Several
        promising research avenues must be pursued through intensified basic and clinical
        research. This will require an increased effort from the existing community of scientists
        working in diabetes, as well as important new input from scientists in immunology,
        genetics, neurology, atherosclerosis, obesity and maternal and child health. </p>
        <p><b>Recommendations on Diabetic Kidney Disease:</b> <ul>
          <li>Increase the study of the basic mechanisms involved in diabetic nephropathy, including

          <li>Establish new multidisciplinary centers for the study of metabolic nerve diseases, with
            an emphasis on diabetic neuropathy, to develop leads for prevention and treatment. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Recommendations on Macrovascular Complications:</b> <ul>
          <li>Increase research on the mechanisms by which diabetes and insulin resistance enhance the
            atherosclerotic process and on the mechanisms of angiogenesis and its use in the treatment
            and prevention of macrovascular disease. </li>

        <p><b>Methods to Optimize Glucose Control</b> </p>
        <p>Despite the findings of clinical trials and other studies that have demonstrated the
        importance of tight glucose control to minimize the risk of long-term complications, many
        patients continue to have far less than optimal control. This is due in part to the risk
        of hypoglycemia, which increases with intensified therapy, and in part to the difficulty
        of obtaining optimal control in a general clinical setting. The Diabetes Research Working
        Group believes that identification of methods that promote implementation of these
        standards of treatment should be a high priority of current clinical research. </p>
        <p><b>Recommendations:</b> <ul>
          <li>Increase basic and clinical research to discover novel approaches for controlling
            hyperglycemia in diabetes. These approaches should include designing small, orally
            bioavailable molecules mimicking insulin action; overcoming insulin resistance or
            stimulating insulin secretion in a physiologic manner; and developing technologies that
            enable administration of insulin by routes other than injection. This research could
            involve enhanced collaboration with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. </li>
          <li>Develop a focused, multidisciplinary research program on hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic
            unawareness. This research should include the neuroendocrine and neuroscience mechanisms
            that underlie these problems, and increased clinical research to find simple, reliable
            techniques to identity patients at greatest risk for severe hypoglycemia. </li>

        </ul>
        <p><b>Diabetes and the Environment</b> </p>
        <p>The environment appears to play important roles in Type 1 diabetes as a trigger for the
        autoimmune response and in Type 2 diabetes as a modifier of pre-existing genetic risk.
        While the latter influence is partly understood, but difficult to control, the former
        influence has been difficult to define in any specific way. Identification of these
        environmental factors would provide important information for any preventive strategies
        for either form of diabetes. </p>
        <p><b>Recommendations:</b> <ul>
          <li>Hold a series of conferences and workshops to explore new methods to search for the
            environmental triggers of Type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases. </li>
          <li>Perform epidemiologic analysis of suspected triggering factors, such as latent or
            endogenous viruses (including retroviruses) or other substances, whose activation may
            initiate the autoimmune process. </li>
          <li>Explore with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the possibility of a

            quantitative measures in normal, living humans of individual-specific energy expenditure,
            energy intake and macronutrient composition, which contribute to obesity and Type 2
            diabetes. </li>
          <li>Initiate new epidemiological studies taking into account genetic susceptibility to help
            identify additional environmental risk factors for Type 2 diabetes, such as stress levels
            and bacterial/viral infectious agents. </li>
          <li>Study environmental factors responsible for the increase in Type 2 diabetes in children

          <li>Increase studies of how to implement effectively the principles of the Diabetes Control
            and Complications Trial (DCCT) in children with Type 1 diabetes in an effort to improve
            glucose control and reduce the complications of disease. </li>
          <li>Increase studies on age-related changes in the development of Type 2 diabetes, and the
            effects of these changes on responses to treatment and prevention strategies in older
            persons. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Diabetes in Minority Populations</b> </p>
        <p>Minority populations, including African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and
        Asians, have the highest incidence of diabetes and the highest rates of complications of
        the disease. Current research has only begun to address the reasons for this in a very
        limited way. These groups are rapidly growing segments of the population and specific
        research must address the reasons for the disproportionate impact of diabetes they bear. </p>
        <p><b>Recommendations:</b> <ul>
          <li>Increase efforts in genetic studies in minority populations as part of the proposed
            National Consortium for the Study of Genetics of Diabetes. </li>
          <li>Support research to identify physiologic and environmental determinants for development
            of Type 2 diabetes and its complications in minority populations, including in children
            and adolescents. </li>
          <li>Support research to identify risk factors, co-morbidities, and primary and secondary
            prevention strategies for micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes in minority
            populations. </li>
          <li>Initiate research to develop culturally sensitive, preventive and therapeutic approaches
            utilizing appropriate, innovative communication and education techniques applicable in
            relevant, &#147;real world&#148; settings, for example, rural clinics, county clinics, and
            urban health centers. </li>
          <li>Design and conduct studies in partnership with minority communities to understand more
            fully the cultural, familial, and other factors that influence adoption of
            health-promotion, and to change high risk behaviors in those with or at risk for Type 2
            diabetes. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Genetic Engineering</b> </p>
        <p>The ability to modify the function of cells through genetic engineering opens up
        tremendous opportunities for new therapeutic approaches to diabetes and its complications.
        The Diabetes Research Working Group recommends that several applications of this
        technology be explored. </p>
        <p><b>Recommendations:</b> <ul>
          <li>Increase research to explore the possible use of genetic engineering as a strategy for
            beta-cell replacement and immunomodulation of transplanted cell lines. </li>
          <li>Expand research to explore the potential for gene therapy for Type 2 diabetes. </li>
          <li>Bolster research to explore unique applications of gene therapy for tissue-specific
            approaches to micro- and macrovascular complications. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Behavioral and Health Services Research</b> </p>
        <p>Lifestyle variables, such as dietary intake and physical activity, represent important
        risk factors for Type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes management can also be influenced by
        behavioral patterns and can greatly influence personal, family and social dynamics. </p>
        <p><b>Recommendations:</b> <ul>
          <li>Intensify clinical behavioral research to develop interventions to improve
            patients&#146; adherence to diabetes treatment and their quality of life, and promote
            sustained improvements in lifestyle behaviors, particularly diet and exercise, which will
            effectively prevent and reduce the risk for diabetes. </li>
          <li>Extend research and development of valid methodologies to measure psychosocial and
            behavioral factors in diabetes. </li>
          <li>Integrate behavioral and pharmacological approaches to reduction of risk factors for
            diabetes and its complications. </li>
          <li>Develop interdisciplinary research teams and training programs to bring together
            individuals who have training in behavioral sciences with those who have training in
            diabetes, nutrition, and exercise physiology. </li>
          <li>Study the effectiveness of different clinical practices, interventions and technologies;
            and identify deficiencies in access to care for diabetic patients. </li>
          <li>Support research to address lifestyle risk factors and behavioral
            modification/counseling programs, including obesity, unhealthful dietary preferences, and
            smoking cessation. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Oral Complications of Diabetes</b> </p>
        <p>Oral complications of diabetes include periodontal diseases, mucosal infections,
        salivary gland dysfunction, and neurological disorders. These complications are extremely
        common, as well as problematic. In addition, they are difficult to treat and greatly
        interfere with essential daily tasks such as eating and speaking. </p>
        <p><b>Recommendations:</b> <ul>
          <li>Establish multidisciplinary Centers for Oral Complications of Diabetes and identify
            means for prevention and treatment. </li>
          <li>Increase studies of the oral complications of diabetes, particularly with respect to the
            chronic destruction of gingival tissues, the immune response to oral bacteria, salivary
            dysfunction, healing of oral wounds, and oral neuropathies. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Resource and Infrastructural Needs</font></b> </p>
        <p>An effective program of diabetes research can exist only if there is a supportive
        infrastructure. New and expanded initiatives are required to address issues of human
        resources, clinical research, special needs for animal research, high-cost technology, and
        other components of infrastructure. Also essential are mechanisms for ongoing review,
        evaluation, and advice regarding implementation of all of the recommendations in the
        Strategic Research Plan set forth by the Diabetes Research Working Group. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrate behavioral and pharmacological approaches to
        reduction of risk factors for diabetes and its complications. </p>
        <p><b>Recommendations:</b><ul>
          <li>For Strengthening Human Resources for Research <ul>
              <li>Create new mechanisms and significantly modify existing programs to maximize
                recruitment, research training, and research career development of diabetes investigators,
                including special initiatives to promote clinical research and to attract investigators
                from other disciplines. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>For Enhancement of the Diabetes Research Centers </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Create new Comprehensive Diabetes Research Centers (CDRCs) to provide enhanced
              infrastructure support, and enhance the effectiveness of existing Diabetes Centers (DERCs
              and DRTCs) by significantly increasing their funding levels and expanding their mission. </li>
          </ul>
          <li>For Developing and Harnessing New Technologies <ul>
              <li>Create a National Diabetes Technology Task Force. </li>
              <li>Create new regional centers with advanced technologies required for metabolic and
                functional imaging studies, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), positron emission
                tomography (PET), and related technologies, which are required for contemporary diabetes
                research, and provide ongoing support for their operation. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>For Animal Models for Study of Diabetes <ul>
              <li>Establish regional Centers for Animal Models of Diabetes and Related Disorders. </li>
              <li>Support mechanisms to develop and characterize larger animal models of Types 1 and 2
                diabetes and their complications, and distribute these models for enhanced approaches to
                genetic and metabolic studies and the full range of diabetes complications. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>For Human Materials for Diabetes Research <ul>
              <li>Expand support of programs for procurement of human tissues and organs in order to serve
                cutting-edge diabetes research; to provide adequate numbers of pancreases for islet cell
                clinical trials and research; to obtain appropriate tissues for study of diabetes
                complications and genetic research; and to ensure availability of a range of human tissues

        <p><b><font size="+1">Summary of Budget Recommendations</font></b> </p>
        <p>The Diabetes Research Working Group has conducted a careful review of NIH-funded
        diabetes research and believes that this enterprise is a strong and valuable component of
        U.S. biomedical research efforts. However, the nation is far from achieving its maximal
        potential with this difficult problem. Limitations are created in part by under-funding of
        diabetes research, and by the design of existing research mechanisms and infrastructure.
        The Diabetes Research Working Group believes that progress over the past decade, coupled
        with the explosion of information in science, makes this an appropriate time to increase
        significantly the nation&#146;s investment to conquer this disease. To implement its
        recommendations, the Diabetes Research Working Group calls upon the Congress and the
        American people to increase research funding through new appropriations to NIDDK and other
        Institutes and Centers of NIH. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="/drwg/budget.html">appended table</a> summarizes
        these budgetary recommendations. They call for stepwise expansion of funding for diabetes
        research providing an increment of $384.5 million for FY2000 rising to an increment of
        $1.166 billion by FY2004. Built on a base of diabetes research funding for FY1999 of
        $442.8 million, this proposed budget increment would result in an approximate four-fold
        increase in overall NIH funding for diabetes research over the coming five-year period.
        The Diabetes Research Working Group believes that such a budget increase is necessary for
        implementation of the programs presented in this Research Plan, consistent with the rising
        impact of diabetes on the U.S. in both human and economic terms, and that the proposed
        budget is more in line with the levels of research funding for other major disease areas.
        Most importantly, the Diabetes Research Working Group believes that such an investment has
        the potential to reduce dramatically the personal, societal and economic burden of
        diabetes for the American people in the 21st century. </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Transmittal to the Congress</font></b> </p>
        <p>In accordance with directives from the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, I am
        pleased to transmit to the Congress the summary of the Strategic Plan for NIH-funded
        diabetes research developed by the congressionally-established Diabetes Research Working
        Group.* As specified by the Congress, this Research Plan includes recommendations for
        future diabetes research directions and corresponding overall budget estimates for
        implementing the proposed new research initiatives. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Diabetes Research Working is an independent panel composed
        of twelve scientific experts in diabetes and four representatives from the lay diabetes
        community. In developing its Strategic Research Plan, the Working Group held plenary
        meetings and subcommittee discussions, analyzed the existing NIH diabetes research
        portfolio, sought the expertise of ad hoc scientists, and enlisted public commentary. The
        Diabetes Research Working Group believes that the culmination of this year-long, in-depth
        planning process is a set of recommendations that will be of value to the Congress and to
        the NIH. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the congressional action calling for the establishment
        of the Diabetes Research Working Group and the development of its Research Plan reflects
        the strong and continuing commitment of the Congress to conquering diabetes. The
        implementation of the research initiatives recommended in this Strategic Research Plan is
        the next vital step toward attaining that objective. </p>
        <p align="right">C. Ronald Kahn, M.D. <br>

        <p>*Note: The congressional directives calling for the establishment of the Diabetes
        Research Working Group and the development of its Strategic Research Plan can be found in
        Senate Report 105-98 (1998, p. 76, p. 110), House Report 105-205 (1998, p. 69, p. 98) and
        House Report 105-635 (1999, p. 69). The charge of the Diabetes Research Working Group
        called for the development of a comprehensive plan for all NIH-funded diabetes research
        efforts, including the recommendation of future diabetes research initiatives and
        directives. Congressional language specifically asked the Working Group to include overall
        cost estimates to accomplish its recommendations in the final research plan. </p>
