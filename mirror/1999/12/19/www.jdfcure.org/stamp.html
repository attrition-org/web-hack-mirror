        <p>You can help make diabetes a national priority. The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation
        International (JDF) is spearheading a national campaign to procure a Diabetes Awareness
        U.S. Postage Stamp. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diabetes is a disease that is poorly understood by the public.
        Relatively few people are aware of the prevalence, seriousness, and costliness of this
        devastating disease. And, research toward the prevention and cure of diabetes and its
        complications is vastly underfunded. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Diabetes Awareness Stamp would help highlight the
        significance of diabetes, create curiosity about the warning signs, and therefore, likely
        lead to earlier and increased diagnosis. Because such a stamp would symbolize that
        diabetes is a disease demanding attention, it would assist in fundraising efforts. It
        would aid in our government relations endeavors as well, indicating to our legislators
        that health-care issues and diabetes research merit their vote of support. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Postal Service receives more than 40,000 letters
        recommending stamp subjects and designs each year. Only 30 new stamps are issued annually.
        Public interest has a favorable impact on the selections of the Citizens&#146; Stamp
        Advisory Committee. Because diabetes affects 16 million Americans, a collective effort
        could make this the most requested stamp in the history of the postal service. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can help by sending a postcard, letter, or petition urging
        the Citizens&#146; Stamp Advisory Committee to issue a Diabetes Awareness Postage Stamp
        (see <a href="stampletter.html">Sample Letter</a>). Please include your own personal
        story about diabetes, and send your request with your signature and address to <dl>
