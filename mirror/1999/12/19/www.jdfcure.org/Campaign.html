        <br>
        JDF has a focused mission: <b>to find a cure for diabetes and its complications through
        the support of research.</b> Twenty-eight years ago, when JDF began its search for the
        cure, little was known about diabetes: what caused it; who would get it; why it caused
        health complications; or how to treat those complications. Research funded and stimulated
        by JDF has changed that. Our knowledge of the disease has grown enormously: <ul>
          <li>We know that Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disease, in which the body attacks itself,
            destroying the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. </li>
          <li>We know there is not one gene, but a combination of genetic traits and environmental
            triggers which cause the disease. </li>
          <li>We can predict who is at risk for diabetes and detect its earliest signs. </li>
          <li>We have scientific proof that tight control of blood sugar reduces complications. </li>
          <li>We can treat diabetic retinopathy and periodontal disease, reduce the necessity of lower
            limb amputations, and control high blood pressure to lessen kidney and cardiovascular
            complications. </li>
          <li>We can greatly enhance fetal health and birth outcome in women with diabetes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To achieve our mission, all relevant and promising research and clinical applications
        must be considered for funding. JDF&#146;s Board believes that to hasten our progress to a
        cure we must fund a diversified &#147;portfolio&#148; of research focused on: <ul>
          <li>prevention of diabetes in those who are at risk, and of reoccurrence in those who have
            been cured by transplantation; </li>
          <li>attainment of normal blood glucose levels through biological and
            bioelectrical-mechanical means, and </li>
          <li>the prevention and mitigation of the consequences of diabetes. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>During our twenty-eight years JDF has made grants of more than $290 million for
        diabetes research, and plans to elevate the pace of research further this year with grants
        totaling over $40 million.</p>
        <p><font color="#aa2b4a" face="Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif" size="+1">Grant Review Process</font>
        <br>
        JDF&#146;s sponsorship of significant and productive research is not coincidental. JDF has
        built a system of senior scientist directed research review based upon the careful
        deliberation of two JDF committees: a Medical Science Review Committee (MSRC) to judge
        each application on scientific merit; followed by a Lay Review Committee which selects
        from the MSRC recommendations those projects which seem most likely to help JDF achieve a
        cure for diabetes and an end to its complications.</p>
        <p><font color="#aa2b4a" face="Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif" size="+1">Contributors</font> <br>
        This rigorous review process has earned the respect and leadership support from several
        significant corporations including: Becton Dickinson Company, Novo Nordisk, The Coca-Cola
        Company, Compaq Computer Corp., FIFTY 50 Foods, and Mistic Brands. A number of prominent
        foundations, as well, rely on JDF to select promising research grants for their ongoing
        contributions. This enables them to avoid creating a costly internal process to solicit,
        review, and fund individual research proposals.</p>
        <p><font color="#aa2b4a" face="Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif" size="+1">Leadership</font> <br>
        JDF provides more money for diabetes research than any other non-profit, non-governmental
        organization in the world. In terms of total dollars awarded to research, JDF now ranks
        third among <i>all</i> non-profit, non-governmental health organizations in the world.
        Moreover, JDF ranks <i>first </i>of all major health agencies<i> </i>in the percentage of
        funds raised that is allocated directly to research. Furthermore, of the private health
        organizations funding research, the percentage of its revenue JDF spends on fund raising
        is among the lowest. This unparalleled efficiency reflects the relentless commitment to
        finding a cure by JDF&#146;s volunteers and supporters.&nbsp; The December, 1997 issue of <a href="Smart Money.htm">Smart Money</a> magazine named JDF as one of the 10 most
        efficient and trustworthy charities in the United States&#151;and only one of two in the
        field of health and medicine. </p>
        <p><font color="#aa2b4a" face="Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif" size="+1">Efficiency</font> <br>
        During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1997, JDF&#146;s total support and revenue was
        $75,083,582. JDF committed $31,491,974 (59%) to its research program of over 350 grants to
        scientists in 15 countries on four continents, including 29 states in the U.S. and four
        provinces in Canada; $11,504,082 (21%) for public diabetes education; $2,488,582 (5%) for
        management and general purposes, and $8,280,119 (15%) for fund raising. </p>
        <p><b><font color="#aa2b4a" face="Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif" size="+2">The Only Remedy
        Is a Cure Campaign</font></b> <br>
        JDF&#146;s success is largely due to <b>The Only Remedy Is a Cure Campaign</b>, an
        international major gifts initiative begun in 1990. Pioneering the public/private
        partnership concept in biomedical research, the Campaign has now secured <u>new research
        dollars</u> from government sources, matching the efforts of individuals, foundations, and
        corporations. As of August, 1998 more than $181.5 million has been raised toward a $200
        million goal. </p>
        <p><font color="#aa2b4a" face="Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif" size="+1">Partnerships</font> <br>
        In 1992, in the single most ambitious enterprise in the history of diabetes research, JDF
        and its first public partner, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
        Diseases (NIDDK), launched six Diabetes Interdisciplinary Research Programs the first such
        programs in the world. These research programs team world-class diabetes researchers with
        scientists specializing in molecular biology, biophysics, genetics, immunology, and other
        cutting-edge areas of biomedical investigation. </p>
        <p>The effectiveness of this partnership (which led to a second JDF/NIDDK partnership in
        1994 and a third JDF/NIDDK partnership in 1997), along with JDF&#146;s successful
        fund-raising efforts, convinced other government entities to join with JDF. To date, JDF
        has entered into agreements with four of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the
        Department of Veterans Affairs, the Medical Research Council of Canada, National Health
        and Medical Research Council of Australia, and the Wallenberg Foundation/Swedish Medical
        Research Council to develop additional five-year, multi-million dollar interdisciplinary
        programs that now number 42 worldwide.</p>
        <p><b>The Only Remedy Is a Cure Campaign</b> provides financial stability to researchers
        which allows for both long term research commitments and rapid exploration of promising
        new research ideas and strategies. In the near future, JDF-funded research holds the
        promise for: <ul>
          <li>successful islet transplantation without dangerous systemic immunosuppression; </li>
          <li>prevention of diabetes in those who are at risk, and of reoccurrence in those who have
            been cured by transplantation; </li>
          <li>creation of an early detection system for kidney disease, preventing the need for
            dialysis and transplantation; </li>
          <li>&#147;immunization&#148; against diabetes, and </li>
          <li>clinical application of basic research developments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><font color="#aa2b4a" face="Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif" size="+1">Role of Philanthropy</font>
        <br>
        A cure for diabetes will likely be achieved in several stages, and from a combination of
        sources. It is imperative, therefore, that JDF continue to fund many different areas of
        basic and clinical research, continue to promote the interdisciplinary approach, and
        increase the number of senior scientists involved in the task. This is all done through
        the generous contributions of the JDF Board of Trustees and thousands of volunteers and
        supporters.</p>
