    Gives JDF an &quot;A&quot;, Joins &quot;Smart Money&quot; in Citing Effectiveness</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The American Institute of Philanthropy&#146;s Spring
    1998, <i>Watchdog Report</i> gives the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation an &quot;A&quot;
    rating, the only such rating for any national diabetes organization, and one of only six
    &quot;A&quot; ratings (out of 44 charities) for general heath organizations nationally. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The rating is based on three major criteria: </font><ul>
      <li><font size="2">The percent spent on the organization&#146;s charitable purpose with an
        AIP target of 60% or more (JDF spent 82% - 83%);</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2">The cost to raise $100, with an AIP target of $35 or less (JDF cost =
        $15); and</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2">Whether or not an organization has opened its books to AIP (JDF freely
        provided material).</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The AIP is a nonprofit charity watchdog and information
    services whose mission is to maximize the effectiveness of charitable
    contributions&nbsp;by providing&nbsp; donors with information needed to make more informed
    giving decisions. </font></td>

    One of 10 &quot;Charities You Can Trust&quot;, according to <i>The Wall Street
    Journal&#146;s</i> &quot;<i>Smart Money</i>&quot; Magazine</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JDF is one of the nation&#146;s top 10
    &quot;charities you can trust,&quot; one of only two health/medical charities in the top
    &quot;notch&quot; ten pick by <i>The Wall Street Journal&#146;s</i> &quot;<i>Smart
    Money&quot;</i> magazine in its December 1997 end-of-year look at charitable giving. Those
    in the coveted top ten received the highest overall efficiency scores in three categories
    as well as favorable peer reviews from such industry watchdogs as the National Charities
    Information Bureau and the Council of Better Business Bureaus. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&nbsp; Taking a close look for consumers at how to decide which
    charities to support, the article states that &quot;while it&#146;s hard to weigh the
    worthiness of one cause over another, you can measure a &nbsp;non-profit group&#146;s
    financial efficiency by finding out how much of your donation dollar is actually being put
    to work in charitable or research programs (versus, for instance, how much is being spent
    on additional direct-mail fundraising).&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The magazine looked at the nation's 100 largest non-profits
    as surveyed in the Non-Profit Times and applied four criteria: </font><ul>
      <li><font size="2"> The amount spent on programs as a percentage of total expenditures;</font></li>

    <p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mission of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation is to
    find a cure for diabetes and its complications through the support of research. JDF has
    over 100 chapters and affiliates in the United States and overseas, and provides more
    money to diabetes research than any other non-profit, non-governmental health agency in
    the world. In fiscal year, 1998, JDF will award over $40 million to diabetes research,
    bringing its cumulative dollar commitment to more than $290 million since 1970.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JDF was founded in 1970 by the parents of children
    with diabetes who were convinced that a cure for diabetes could be found through research.
    They were and still are determined to make that cure happen in their children&#146;s
    lifetime. </font></p>
