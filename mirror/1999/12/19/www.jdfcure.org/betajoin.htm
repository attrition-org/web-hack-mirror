We have chosen BETA as the symbol of this society because it
reminds us of the devastating nature of diabetes, but also
represents the hope that modern science holds for diabetes
victims&#150;-through research a cure will be found. </p>

<p>Your membership in <b>The BETA Society</b> helps ensure that
vital diabetes research continues while providing you with these
benefits: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Decreased income and estate taxes; </li>
    <li>Increased assets for yourself and your individual and
        charitable beneficiaries through thoughtful tax planning;
    </li>
    <li>An increased income stream and avoidance of capital gains
        taxes (with a life-income plan). </li>
</ul>

<p>Members of <b>The BETA Society</b> are recognized by JDF in
the following ways: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The gift of a handsome lapel pin; </li>
    <li>A listing in JDF&#146;s Annual Report and other JDF
        publications (unless anonymity is requested); </li>
    <li>Invitations to special recognition events for members and
        their guests. </li>
</ul>

<p>You can join <b>The BETA Society</b> by including JDF in your
plans through one of the following arrangements: </p>

<blockquote>
    <h3>A Bequest in Your Will</h3>
    <p>There are several ways to make a bequest to JDF. You can
    leave: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A specific dollar amount; </li>
        <li>A specific percentage, or all, of your residuary
            estate (the remainder left after bequests to others,
            debts and expenses are paid); </li>
        <li>Specific items, such as stocks, bonds, or personal
            property such as jewelry or historical artifacts; </li>
        <li>A gift in trust that pays a portion of the trust
            property to individual beneficiaries and a portion to
            JDF. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your estate will receive an estate tax charitable
    deduction for a properly planned bequest to JDF. </p>
    <h3>A Life-Income Gift</h3>
    <p>Through a life-income plan you can give cash or other
    assets and receive income for life or a term of years (or
    provide income to another individual) while making a gift of
    the remainder to JDF. These plans provide you with an income
    tax deduction, reduce your estate taxes and often help you to
    avoid capital gains taxes while increasing your income
    stream. Some life-income plans provide fixed income and some
    provide variable income, giving you a choice to fit your
    circumstances. </p>
    <h3>A Gift of Real Estate</h3>
    <p>You can give real estate to JDF outright or through a
    life-income plan. You can also contribute your personal
    residence while retaining the right to live in it. Such gifts
    can provide significant income, estate and capital gains tax
    savings. </p>
    <h3>A Gift of Life Insurance</h3>
    <p>You can name JDF as irrevocable owner and beneficiary of
    an existing life insurance policy that you no longer need or
    you can simply retain ownership of your policy and designate
    JDF as a beneficiary. You can also purchase a new policy to
    benefit JDF. Life insurance gifts offer income and estate tax
    advantages. </p>
    <h3>A Gift of Personal Property</h3>
    <p>You can give personal property that has appreciated in
    value (artwork, for example) and receive a current charitable
    income tax deduction for the full appreciated value of the
    item if JDF uses it in furtherance of its charitable
    purposes. </p>
    <h3>A Gift of Income to JDF, the Remainder to Your Children
    or Grandchildren</h3>
    <p>You can establish a lead trust by transferring cash or
    other assets to a Trustee, who distributes income to JDF for
    a period of time. When the trust terminates, the remainder is
    transferred to your children or grandchildren with a
    significant gift and estate tax savings. </p>
