        Porter 244 Signatures!</b></font> </p>
        <p>The Congressional Diabetes Caucus has circulated a letter to all Members of the House
        of Representatives (see <a href="/advocacy/wr23.html">WR: II, 6</a>) urging their
        colleagues to sign a letter in support of increased federal funding for diabetes research.
        Based on recommendations by the Diabetes Research Working Group (DRWG), the letter
        outlines the need for $827 million for diabetes research for FY2000, up from $449 million
        appropriated in FY99. This letter will be delivered to Chairman John Porter (R-IL), who
        chairs the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, and Health and Human Services and
        Education on Tuesday, March 23. </p>
        <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif" color="#aa2b4a"><b>Diabetes Research Working
        Group to Brief Capitol Hill</b></font> </p>
        <p>The Diabetes Research Working Group will participate in a special briefing hosted by
        Chairman John Edward Porter (R-IL) and the House Labor/HHS/Education Subcommittee on
        Appropriations. Chairman of the JDF Communications S. Robert Levine, M.D., will present
        JDF&#146;s interpretation of the Congressionally mandated report. The Congressional
        Diabetes Caucus and other diabetes organizations will also participate in the briefing on
        Tuesday, March 23. See also, <a href="../drwg/index.html">DRWG Strategic Research Plan Summary</a>. </p>

        Medicare Insulin Pump Bill</b></font> </p>
        <p>Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) introduced the &#147;Medicare Insulin Pump Coverage Act of
        1999&#148; on March 15, 1999. Medicare does not currently cover insulin pumps under any
        circumstance. Medicare now covers diabetes testing supplies, insulin and equipment. A
        growing number of private insurers are now including full or partial coverage for external
        insulin pumps. Senator Collins cited research from the Diabetes Control and Complications
        Trial showing significant delay or avoidance of diabetes complications through tight blood
        glucose control. Chair of JDF Government Relations Leah Mullin&#146;s letter of support
        and thanks to Senator Collins was published in the Congressional Record. </p>
        <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif" color="#aa2b4a"><b>Congress Recognizes JDF
        Vermont Volunteer, Age 9</b></font> </p>
        <p>Philip Burgin-Young&#151;a nine-year-old from Burlington, Vermont&#151;sent a letter to
        Representative Bernard Sanders (I-VT) and Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and James Jeffords
        (R-VT). Representative Sanders was so moved by the letter, he submitted it to the <i>Congressional
        Record</i> on March 2, 1999. The Members sent Philip notes pledging their support for
        finding a cure for diabetes. We congratulate Philip on his successful advocacy at a very
        young age! </p>
        <p>After describing what Philip must go through daily living with diabetes, he concluded
        his letter by writing: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&#147;I want a cure for diabetes so that I can do what I want with my life. I want to
          be healthy, and I want to help other people by being a scientist who helps to find cures
          for diseases. I also want a cure for all of the other people who have diabetes. As hard as
          it is for me with diabetes, at least I am lucky because my mom and dad and sister help me
          try to take real good care of myself. Some kids aren&#146;t so lucky and they end up in
          the hospital. </p>
          <p>Will you please vote for more money for research to try to find a cure for diabetes? I
          know that with more money, scientists will be able to find a cure more easily. There are
          so many areas that are being research and if they don&#146;t have enough money, they
          can&#146;t do the research. PLEASE HELP!&#148; </p>
          <p>Sincerely, </p>
          <p>Philip Burgin-Young </p>
