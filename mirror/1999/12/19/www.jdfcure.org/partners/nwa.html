        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northwest Airlines will donate 500 WorldPerks Bonus Miles to
        any WorldPerks member who chooses either to (1) donate at least 5,000 WorldPerks miles to
        JDF, or (2) make a donation of $50 or more to JDF. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WorldPerks Members may call the WorldPerks automated
        information line at (800) 327-2881 to donate banked miles. Members must specify they would
        like their donation to go to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. The minimal donation is
        5,000 miles; donations of more than 5,000 miles may be made in 1,000-mile increments.
        Donated miles must have at least two months remaining before expiration. WorldPerks donors
        will have 500 WorldPerks Bonus Miles automatically added to their statements. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a tax-deductible monetary contribution, WorldPerks
        members may send a check directly to JDF (see address, upper left) or may donate via
        credit card by calling 1-800-JDF-CURE. Please mention the Northwest AirCares program and
        include your WorldPerks account number. Members who contribute $50 or more to JDF earn 500
        WorldPerks Bonus Miles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these ongoing services, during the second
        quarter of this year passengers on every Northwest flight enjoyed a four-minute video
        about JDF featuring Mary Tyler Moore, a series of articles on JDF accompanied by an appeal
        envelope was featured in the in-flight magazine <i>World Traveler,</i> and Northwest ran
        full page ads about JDF&#146;s mission every month in <i>USA Today.</i> </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, over 6 million miles and $50,000 have been donated to
        JDF thanks to the promotion. &#147;Beyond the dollars and miles donated, we are very
        grateful for the program&#146;s added benefit of media exposure&#151;worth approximately
        $400,000&#151;that has alerted millions of travelers to JDF&#146;s urgent mission: to find
        a cure for diabetes and its complications through the support of research,&#148; said Dr.
        James E. Mulvihill, president and CEO of JDF. </p>
