<H1>World Evangelical Fellowship<BR>
Organization</H1>

<P>
In the 1990's WEF has positioned itself as the preeminent church-based Evangelical organization in the world. It has 111 <A HREF="3membody.htm">country and regional members</A> 3 affiliate member organizations, and 92 associate member organizations, with a service constituency approaching 150 million.  WEF members, such as the Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches and the Association of Evangelicals in Africa (AEA) have spearheaded work in relief and development, church planting, leadership development, evangelism, and human rights within their nations and regions.<BR>
<P>
The WEF <A HREF="#IntlCouncil">International Council</A>, its highest decision-making body, has representatives from all over the world, primarily from developing countries in the two-thirds world.  <A HREF="3vencer.htm">Dr. Agustin B. Vencer, Jr.</A> is the

<FONT SIZE=+1>WEF and <A HREF="3membody.htm">member organizations</A><BR>
exist to establish and help<BR>
regional and national evangelical alliances<BR>
empower and mobilize local churches<BR>
and Christians organizations<BR>
to disciple the nations for Christ.</FONT><BR>

<A NAME="strategy"><H2>Strategy</H2></A>
</CENTER>

The central objective of the World Evangelical Fellowship is to enable local congregations of believers to disciple their own nations for Christ.<BR>
"By discipled nations," explains Dr. Jun Vencer, WEF's International Director, "we mean those where a growing Christian witness exists, and increasing justice for all, diminishing poverty and sharing of human resources is being realized."<BR>
<P>
<EM>The WEF strategy to reach this objective is built on <STRONG>three foundational elements</STRONG>:</EM><BR>
<P>
<STRONG>First</STRONG>, WEF believes that the local church is God's chosen vehicle for reaching out to the unevangelized world around it and that Spirit-filled local believers involved in the issues of their communities are the most convincing expression of the kingdom of God.<BR>
<P>
<STRONG>Second</STRONG>, WEF brings the various Christian denominations and other Christian organizations of evangelical tradition to work together in helpful national alliances.<BR>
<P>
<STRONG>Third</STRONG>, WEF serves as an umbrella for 111 regional and national alliances worldwide.  In doing so, one of WEF's primary functions is to empower evangelicals who are in danger of being marginalized in their own countries.  Evangelicals in the minority in Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa are struggling to gain legitimate status from their governments.  They need to know that they are not isolated and that WEF's membership stands with them in their fight.  Thus, discrimination against evangelicals becomes not just a national issue, but an international one.<BR>
<P>
The <STRONG>ACTION PLAN</STRONG> for WEF's strategy is:<BR>
<P>
<STRONG>A.  WEF <EM>empowers national fellowships</EM> to serve local churches</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>by LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT -- developing leadership, management and communication skills through training in strategic planning, organization and prayerfully achieving results.
<LI>by NATIONAL ENABLEMENT -- creating a structure for united action and integration of mission, church and parachurch activities in a common commitment to reach the world for Christ.
<LI>by GLOBAL NETWORKING -- networking local and international human and material resources for true multi-cultural partnership in ministry as the global body of Christ.
</UL>
<STRONG>B.  National Evangelical Fellowships/Alliances <EM>mobilize local churches</EM> to disciple the nation</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>by uniting churches, denominations and Christian organizations in a unified program of prayer and preparation for spiritual renewal and harvest.
<LI>by planning and coordinating a nationwide campaign of evangelism and discipleship training that reaches every people group and community.
<LI>by providing an accountability structure that is responsive to participating churches and organizations and reports with credibility to resource partners.

<A NAME="vision"><H2>Vision</H2></A>
</CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=+1>WEF's vision is that of a dynamic church, united in a vital, common faith, and committed to proclaiming the gospel in terms relevant to our generation.</FONT><BR>
<P>
This is the heart of World Evangelical Fellowship's mission.  The Gospel must be heard by every person, a Bible available to every family, a church planted in every village, Godly values inculturated in every society.<BR>
<P>
<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=+1><EM><STRONG>The dream is to disciple every nation of the world for Christ.</STRONG></EM></FONT><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
Essential to this dream are vibrant local churches working together in unity to fulfill the Great Commission.  WEF is a church-based, grassroots movement with the primary task of equipping and mobilizing churches and parachurch organizations to disciple the nations for Christ.<BR>
<P>
The strategic value of World Evangelical Fellowship to the task of world evangelization is the establishment and strengthening of national and regional evangelical alliances in every country and continent so that churches and Christian organizations may work together.<BR>
<P>
International Director, Dr. Jun Vencer, says, <EM>"WEF has been described as the dream that would not die.  For me, it is a dream worth dying for."</EM><BR>

<A NAME="statementfaith"><H2>Statement of Faith</H2></A><BR>

We believe in the Holy Scriptures as originally given by God, divinely inspired, infallible, entirely trustworthy; and the supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct...<BR>
<P>
One God, eternally existent in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit...<BR>
<P>
Our Lord Jesus Christ, God manifest in the flesh, His virgin birth, His sinless human life, His divine miracles, His vicarious and atoning death, His bodily resurrection, His ascension, His mediatorial work, and His Personal return in power and glory...<BR>
<P>
The Salvation of lost and sinful man through the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ by faith apart from works, and regeneration by the Holy Spirit...<BR>
<P>
The Holy Spirit, by whose indwelling the believer is enabled to live a holy life, to witness and work for the Lord Jesus Christ...<BR>
<P>
The Unity of the Spirit of all true believers, the Church, the Body of Christ...<BR>
<P>
The Resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved unto the resurrection of life, they that are lost unto the resurrection of damnation.<BR>

<A NAME="values"><H2>Values</H2></A>
</CENTER>

<B><I>WEF's core values are:</I></B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>the necessity of proclaiming a holistic gospel to all nations
<LI>the authority of the Scriptures
<LI>the uniqueness of Christ
<LI>the imperative of global partnership in missions
<LI>the centrality of the church in God's redemptive plan.
</UL>

Perhaps the greatest need in the body of Christ today is a renewal of passion for winning the lost to Christ, along with a new paradigm of unity based on our Lord's holistic concerns for people of Planet Earth.  International church life relates to Jesus' expressed concerns that "they might be one as the Father and I are one" and that His followers "disciple the nations."<BR>
This dual desire is amplified by Jesus' reminder that the world "will know you are my disciples by the way you show love to each other."<BR>
WEF's mission is the outworking of unity based on the revealed truth of Scripture, commitment to the Great Commission, and the Spirit-engendered desire that Christian corporate life be characterized by mutual love, respect and equality of relationship.  Such manifestation transcends the usual divisiveness of culture, language, ethnic origin or non-essential theological distinctives.<BR>

<BIG>A 19th century dream is realized in the 20th century<BR>
with vision for the 21st</BIG><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
London 1846.  Christians from ten countries, 800 representatives in all, met for the purpose of launching, in their own words, "a new thing in church history, a definite organization for the expression of unity amongst Christian individuals belonging to different churches."<BR>
In 1951, believers from 21 countries officially formed the World Evangelical Fellowship.  Today, 150 years after the London gathering, WEF is a dynamic global structure for unity and action that embraces more than 150 million evangelicals in 111 countries.  It is a unity based on the historic Christian faith expressed in the evangelical tradition.  And it looks to the future with vision to accomplish God's purposes in discipling the nations for Jesus Christ.<BR>
