<h1 align="center">TO FUBY.....</h1>

<p align="center">Fuby.... Its funny how lately you are doing all these leet #2 hacks and
re-hacking everything in sight. Your jealousy over the fame you never got has lead you to
become worse than anyone you are trying to talk shit about. You think the defacements by
myself, Pr1sm, DHC, and acidklown are lame. Are you fuckin stupid or does Stealing HTML,
Re-hacking sites, and talking shit about people you dont' even know constitute L33t to
you? Dude you are worse than anyone you are talking about</p>

<p align="center">I've been on the scene now for many years, defacing for 2. I am always
open to everyone on my hacks and will tell anyone what the hole was. Sometimes I'll patch
it or write the admin and sometimes I won't. I've never talked shit about anyone and until
today when my defacements came so VERY important to you no one had ever talked shit about
me either. Here I sit in IRC and all my /msg's are about how fuxin lame you are. While my
recent defacements haven't been master hacks, They are mine. I did them for me, cuz I felt
like doing them. If you want to rehack them and look like a dumbass trying to prove to the
underground what a lamer you are...that is fine with me. Go ahead and keep up the good
work</p>

<p align="center">I'm not saying everyone OR anyone is hacking for the right reasons
lately. I'm just saying that if Hacker A hacks www.blah.com it's his business.....and if
he isn't talkin shit then everything is fine. All you are doing is crossing the lines and
being lame. Please stop talkin so much shit and find your dignity, honor and respect...</p>

<p>-ANALOGNET </p>

<p>ps - I've been talkin to pr1sm all day today. He is a friend of mine and if you think
you are hacking WITH him and using his html with permission......he is pretty pissed about
it and thinks you are lame to...</p>
