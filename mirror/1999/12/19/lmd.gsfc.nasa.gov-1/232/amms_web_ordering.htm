<dir>
  </b></u><font SIZE="2"><p>Code 230 now has a new stores stock order entry system
  available. To replace the AMMS portion of ASAP which replaced the SATS system, Code 230
  designed a new web-based order entry system which has been tested by several of our
  biggest users and we received positive responses from them. You may continue to use ASAP
  to process your orders but it may be discontinued in the near future. The new web based
  AMMS Order Entry System will streamline and expand your stores stock order entry process
  by allowing up 100 lines to be processed on a single customer requisition. To be able to
  access the AMMS Order Entry system your computer needs to meet the following requirements:<dir>
    <b><p>PC Requirements</p>
    </b><p>Netscape Navigator 4.06 or later version or Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 or
    later version.</p>
    <b><p>Macintosh Requirements</p>
    </b><p>Power PC</p>
    <p>Mac OS 7.6.1 or later</p>

    <p>MS Internet Explorer 4.01 or later version</p>
    <p>Mac OS Runtime for Java (MRJ) 2.1.2 Available from <u>www.apple.com/java</p>
    </u><p>To insure that the JON information we have is correct in the new system, please

    system.</p>
