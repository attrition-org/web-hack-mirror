<p>WELCOME ABOARD AND CONGRATS TO OUR TWO NEW BRANCH HEADS!!! </p>
<font SIZE="4">

<p>MARILYN TOLLIVER </font></b><font SIZE="2">has recently been selected as Head of the
Management Support Branch, Code 231. Her rise from a Howard University intern to branch
head in six years is a reflection of the talent and energy she brings to her new job. For
the last 2 years, Marilyn served as the Center's Mail, Directives, and Forms manager where
her team-building skills and ability to develop creative solutions to difficult issues has
brought her recognition from GSFC and NASA Headquarters management. In addition to a
number of outstanding performance awards, she was Code 200 Rookie of the Year in 1990 and
awarded a Productivity Improvement and Quality Enhancement Award in 1993 for her
participation in a Process Action Team that made significant improvements in the Center's
mail system. We are happy to have Marilyn as the new branch head and know she will do a
great job with the excellent Code 231 support team. </p>
</font><font SIZE="4"><b>

<p>J. R. HEDGPETH </b></font><font SIZE="2">comes to Code 230 from the Naval Ordnance

<p ALIGN="CENTER">GUARA PROJECT</p>
</b><font SIZE="2">

<p>NASA Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) is conducting a sounding rocket campaign from
Alcântara, Brazil. Alcântara is located on the northeastern coast near the city of São
Luis. Launches started August 15 and ended October 20, 1994.</p>

<p>The purpose of the campaign is to study the unique properties of the earth's ionosphere
at the equator. This campaign is an integral part of the international equatorial
electrojet year. Results from the campaign are expected to form the basis for part of the
design of several new NASA satellites, including the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere
Energetics and Dynamics Satellite.</p>

<p>On July 5 and July 9, 1994, 485,000 pounds of project equipment/ materiel were shipped
to Brazil via a chartered AN-124 aircraft. These shipments included radar vans, telemetry
vans, launchers, booms, cable, rocket motors, and various other ground support equipment.
By using this large aircraft it was possible to ship all equipment/materiel direct from
WFF to the range at Alcântara, bypassing extremely poor road and bridge conditions in
Brazil.</p>

<p>The WFF Logistics Branch and Ogden Logistics Services (OLS) arranged for the aircraft,
coordinated the packing/crating and movement of freight, and supervised the loading and </p>

<p>unloading of the aircraft. We will continue to provide packing/crating and shipping
support throughout the project as several other major payload shipments will be made by
commercial airfreight. </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR RECYCLED PAPER PRODUCTS</b><img SRC="Image24.gif"
ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="76" HEIGHT="69"><b></p>
</b><font SIZE="2">

<p>A recent Presidential Executive Order on recycling sets forth stricter requirements for
the recycled content of paper products. GSFC is mandated to supply printing and writing
paper with no less than 20% post consumer materials beginning December 31, 1994 and 30%
post consumer materials by December 31, 1998 for high speed copier paper, offset paper,
computer printout paper, carbonless paper, file folders, and white woven envelopes. The
minimum standard for other uncoated printing and writing paper such as writing and office
paper, bond paper, cotton fiber paper, and cover stock will be no less than 20% post
consumer materials by December 31, 1994. The stock number for copier paper will remain
7530-00-N83-4436. Customers with color copiers should order stock number 7530-00-181-7174.
Code 230 is working to meet the additional new requirements. At Greenbelt contact Customer
Service at extension 6-8900 or at Wallops contact extension 7-1854 if you have any
questions.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">STEVENSON-WYDLER TECHNOLOGY</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">INNOVATION ACT (HELPING LOCAL SCHOOLS)</p>
</b><font SIZE="2">

<p>This federal act allows agencies to provide excess research equipment to educational
institutions for the conduct of technical and scientific education and research
activities. Eligible organizations are elementary through high school (public and
private), colleges and universities, and home schools. With the assistance of the
Education Office in Code 130, the Property Management Branch, Code 235, implemented a
pilot program in March 1994 concentrating on elementary through high school grade levels.
Public and private schools in Prince George's County, Washington, D.C. and Accomack
County, VA were selected. The remaining schools in Maryland and Northern Virginia will be
open to this program on November 3, 1994.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">REMANUFACTURED TONER CARTRIDGES!!</p>
</b><font SIZE="2">

<p>Because of Congress' recent mandate to Federal agencies to stop issuing new toner
cartridges and begin issuing recycled toner cartridges, almost all of the printer
cartridges now available through stores stock are remanufactured. </p>

<p>Each remanufactured cartridge is provided with a prepaid mailing label for return of
the empty cartridge to the contractor. When you replace your expended cartridge with a
remanufactured cartridge, please observe the following return procedures: 

<ul>
  <li>Place the expended cartridge in the box</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Affix the prepaid mailing label to the outside of the box</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Seal the box using the tape furnished with the cartridge</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Greenbelt customers should place the box in the outgoing mail box for pickup </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Wallops customers should call the dispatcher at extension 7-1587 to arrange for pickup</li>
</ul>

<p>Greenbelt customers who replace an expended cartridge with a cartridge that doesn't
have a mailing label, should place the expended cartridge in the box and put it in the
recycled toner cartridge tubs that have been placed near the loading dock of most
buildings. At Wallops, if you replace an expended cartridge that doesn't have a mailing
label, place the expended cartridge in the box, mark the outside </font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE="2">A</font><font SIZE="2">for pickup,</font><font
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE="2">@</font><font SIZE="2"> and call the dispatcher at
extension 7-1587, to arrange for pickup. These cartridges will be picked up by a
government approved recycling contractor.</p>

<p>We want to hear about any problems you have with the remanufactured toner cartridges or
any other problems with stores stock materials. At Greenbelt contact Customer Service at
extension 6-8900 or at Wallops contact extension 7-1854.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">RETAIL SALES ON CENTER</p>
</b><font SIZE="2">

<p>Goddard has recently received a GSA waiver to conduct retail sales on Center. Changes
to NASA Personal Property Disposal Manual, NHB 4300.1, will allow sales agents in the
Property Management Branch, Code 235, to conduct sales of surplus equipment, material and
furniture via auctions, sealed bid sales, and sales at fixed prices. Sales will be open to
the general public, and all NASA employees except individuals directly involved in the
excess process, this includes: having access to sales items property records; involvement
in the administration or termination of contractor inventory; maintenance, use,
inspection; or, those who support the disposal and sales processes. Dates of sales will be
widely distributed through cc:Mail, dateline, and GSFCMail. </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">INTERIOR DESIGN<font SIZE="2"> </font>GOES TO EUROPE</p>
</b><font SIZE="2">

<p>Flexibility has always been a key component of the Code 230/239 interior design staff,
but even this capability was stretched when the staff was faced with the requirements for
the Experiment Operation Facility (EOF) in building 3. The Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) mission is the focal point for coordinated activities, including the
European Space Agency (ESA). Requirements for the facility were unique in many respects,
resulting in a custom design of furniture components. Because of the custom design,
facility occupants had to be presented copies of the furniture layouts to ensure their
space was properly fitted to their needs. Unfortunately, some future occupants of the
facility were still in Europe.</p>

<p>To meet this unique requirement, the designer developed three-dimensional drawings in
AutoCAD and distributed them electronically to each scientist in Europe. The scientists
reviewed the drawings, revised them as needed, and sent them back to the design office for
final revisions. As a result both the customer's needs and the design time frames were
met.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">EEE PARTS FOR CIRS/CASSINI</p>
</b><font SIZE="2">

<p>An Electronic, Electrical and Electromechanical (EEE) Parts Team has been established
by our Logistics Support Contractor, Ogden Logistics Services' (OLS) to catalog and
purchase the EEE parts requirements for the CIRS/Cassini instrument. More than half of
those parts have been purchased, received and stored in the EEE Parts Room that has been
certified for handling Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) sensitive materials. In the near
future, the team will be kitting these parts for engineering model assembly and sending
the flight model parts to the Code 311 Mission Support Contractor for parts verification
testing (PVT) to certify them as flight qualified parts. As a result of this project, the
Logistics Management Division has developed the capability to stock flight qualified
parts, and will have a stock of those parts available for issue to customers Centerwide.
If you would like additional information about our EEE parts service, please contact Glenn
Harris at extension 6-3385.</p>
