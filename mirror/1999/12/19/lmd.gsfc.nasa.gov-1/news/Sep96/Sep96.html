<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On April 8, 1996, NASA-8 began providing shuttle services, on a trial
basis, between the Wallops Flight Facility (WFF), Langley Research Center (LaRC) and the
Washington National Airport (DCA) every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. This was in addition
to the normal runs from WFF to Baltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI) occurring
on Tuesdays and Thursdays. These additional flights provide for improved planning and
scheduling of meetings and reduced travel time over commercial air or motor vehicles. This
trial period ends September 30, 1996.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the period August 29 through September 30, the flight schedule was
changed to provide daily trips from WFF to LaRC to DCA. Shuttle bus service was made
available from DCA to Greenbelt. Cost data will be analyzed so that a final decision on
the future of the shuttle service can be made by the end of the fiscal year. Usage has
increased, but the actual cost data will determine if the service is cost effective.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just-In-Time (JIT) Program</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE="1">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">by <a href="mailto:Edward.G.Stuckrath.1@gsfc.nasa.gov">Ed Stuckrath</a></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In December 1995, the Logistics Management Division (LMD) initiated a
JIT delivery program for office supplies in support of NASA Headquarters and Goddard (both
Greenbelt and WFF locations). The Code 230 logistics services contractor, Cortez III,
along with its subcon-tractor, ANSTEC, entered into a contract with Office Depot of
Savage, Maryland, to provide an inventory management service, including next-day desktop
delivery, for the most commonly used office supplies. Requests for supplies not carried in
Stores Stock are faxed every evening to Office Depot for next-day delivery. It is
anticipated that by October 1, 1996, Code 230 will be using Electronic Data Interchange
(EDI) technology to transmit orders directly to Office Depot&#146;s computer in Florida.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through July 1996, Office Depot processed over 6,000 requisitions
valued at $577,000 and achieved a 92.4% next-day delivery performance. From the 200 JIT
Customer Service Summary cards received so far, over 98% of the responses are good to
excellent. We will continue to expand the number of items to be provided through Office
Depot as we continue to deplete Stores Stock material. Additionally, we are exploring the
possibility of expanding the JIT concept to other commodity groups such as lumber,
janitorial supplies, packing and crating material, and hardware.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An office supply catalog for the JIT Program is in the works and should
be available to center customers by the end of September.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The LMD hosted the Code 200 Awards Ceremony on July 25, 1996. The
planning committee, consisting of representatives from both the government and Cortez,
took advantage of the fact that the 1996 Summer Olympics were happening during the same
week as the awards ceremony, and planned the Code 200 event with an Olympic theme. Besides
having some hilarious Olympic &quot;events,&quot; the ceremony also featured 35 awards
given to individuals and groups in the directorate for their &quot;gold-medal&quot;
performances during the past year. If you missed the awards ceremony, or if you are just
dying to see it again, you are in luck -- the ceremony is on videotape! If you would like
a copy of the videotape, call Kelly Carter at extension 6-8899. All you have to do is give

<p>The Wonderful World Of &quot;Rehabilitated&quot; Furniture</font><font FACE="Bookman Old Style"> </p>
</font></b><font FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE="1">

<p>by Marilyn Tolliver</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking for a nicely refurbished wood desk or a reasonably priced
con-ference table? Maybe you need a reupholstered chair or some systems furniture? If the
answer is yes, then look no further. The LMD has an agreement with the U. S. Department of
Agriculture in Landover, Maryland, for GSFC customers (civil servants and contractors) to
screen and purchase refurbished furniture, affectionately known as &quot;Rehab.&quot;
Rehab furniture generally consists of conventional wood or metal desks, tables, credenzas,
files, reupholstered chairs, sofas, lounge furniture, and some systems furni-ture. The
cost of this furniture is approximately 40% less than the cost of purchasing new office
furniture.</p>

<p>For more details, please contact Ms. <a href="mailto:Sylvia.N.Parker.1@gsfc.nasa.gov">Sylvia
Parker</a>, Code 231, at extension 6-3407. Arrangements to screen and/or purchase are by

<p><font FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE="3"><b>Disposal of Government Property for Off-Site
Contractors</b></font></p>
<font FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE="1">

<p>by Larry Parsons</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the terms and conditions of most contracts, Government property
provided to off-site contractors will normally be disposed of through a Plant Clearance
Officer when identified as excess. However, contractors will sometimes ask their
Government counterparts to let them return their excess equipment to the custody of the
project office and then subsequently to the Code 230 excess operation. <i><b>This should
not occur. </b></i>Disposal services have already been paid for through the Defense
Contract Management Command.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, do not allow off-site contractors to return Government
property to GSFC for disposal unless there is a known and defined requirement for that
property. If the property is excess, it should be processed through the Plant Clearance
Officer assigned to that contract. On occasion, there are exceptions to this policy,
princi-pally in circumstances where the Government can benefit from the return of the
excess equipment. Those occasions must be approved, in advance, by Goddard&#146;s Property
Disposal Officer, Ms. <a href="mailto:Sara-Beth.A.Jensen.1@gsfc.nasa.gov">Sara Jensen</a>,
Code 235, who can be reached at extension 6-3319.</p>

contract property, please call <a href="mailto:Denise.M.Duignan.1@gsfc.nasa.gov">Denise

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">by Dave Maxwell</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Value comes from doing the right things well.&quot; Using this
quote by Harry Furukawa of the Maryland Center for Quality and Productivity as a starting
point, a Customer Value Process Action Team (PAT) of 12 LMD members embarked on an 8-month
study to investigate Code 230&#146;s performance and value from a customer&#146;s point of
view.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Based on extensive one-on-one interviews with a diverse sample of
established Code 230 customers,</font><font FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE="2"> </font><font FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE="1">a survey was distributed to over 2,800 Greenbelt and WFF
govern-ment and contractor employees. Over 400 responses were returned for analysis. In
early June, the PAT, led by the Logistics and Transportation Management Branch Head, J.R.
Hedgpeth, reported the results to the Code 230 Quality Improvement Council. On an A
(outstand-ing) to F (unsatisfactory) scale, Code 230 customers consistently rated their
logistics support services in the B+ to B- range, with WFF customers displaying a slightly
higher level of customer satisfaction.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So what is next? Based on the study results, Code 230 will follow up in
selected areas where customer responses point to a need to make specific changes. In some
cases, performance innovations are already in place and further study will reveal the
effectiveness of these changes as measured by Code 230 customers. In other cases, the
survey results will be used as a springboard for further study and development of needed
changes that will improve logistics services provided to Greenbelt</font><font FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE="2"> and </font><font FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE="1">WFF

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mass Transit Subsidy Program</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE="1">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">by Mike Taylor</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1991, the federal government instituted a Public Mass Transit
Subsidy Program, which would allow agencies to compensate their employees for using public
transporta-tion (e.g. Metro, MARC) in commuting to work. Several agencies have implemented
the program since that time, but so far it&#146;s been limited to those agencies located
in urban areas. Last fall, GSFC formed a center team, led by LMD, to look at the
feasibility of implementing a Mass Transit Subsidy Program at Greenbelt, Wallops, and our
GISS facility in New York City. The study results were presented to Management Council in
July 1996, but they concluded that the number of people the program would benefit is
relatively small (estimated at less than 100 total for all of GSFC). In addition, it was
felt that offering a subsidy would not achieve the intended goal of increasing the number
of people who use public trans-portation to get to work. As a result, the Management
Council decided not to implement the program at this time. However, if future changes in
the local public transportation system increase the GSFC employee ridership, and if
there&#146;s enough interest in the program, then we will reexamine the benefits and
costs, and pursue it further with GSFC management. If you have any questions about the
program, please call <a href="mailto:Michael.J.Taylor.1@gsfc.nasa.gov">Mike Taylor</a> at
