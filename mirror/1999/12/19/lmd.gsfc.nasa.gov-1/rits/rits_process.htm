<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The GSFC Receiving Inspection and Test System (RITS) is a web-based system, maintained
by the Logistics Management Division (Code 230), employed by acquisition initiators to
establish and document Receiving Inspection Instructions on a Work Order Authorization
(WOA) and compile a history of supplier performance based upon the results of receiving
inspection and test for each acquisition. This system is also used by acquisition
initiators and procurement personnel to check the performance history of a supplier prior
to purchasing products.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Receiving Inspection and Test System (RITS) is used for the following GSFC products
that have been defined to be in-scope to the QMS:

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>flight products (spacecraft, instruments, balloons, and sounding rockets), components,
      piece parts, and material</li>
    <li>any item that directly interfaces with flight products, including software </li>
    <li>ground support equipment; ground stations; and inspection, measuring, and test equipment</li>
    <li>RITS is not used for services or documents</li>
    <li>RITS is not used for administrative supplies or general tools</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using RITS employs a 3-step process:

<dir>
  <p>1. Create a WOA &#150; It is best to create the WOA as soon as possible after the
  acquisition has been awarded (and prior to processing the product) to preclude delays in
  accepting the product once it has been delivered. The contract/purchase order number or
  other identification number will be required. WOAs may be initiated by copying an existing
  WOA. The receiving inspection instructions included in the WOA are those inspection/test
  events required to accept delivery. If desired, the WOA template may be printed. </p>
  <p>2. Accept delivery &#150; Once the product has been delivered, the product must be
  accepted. Begin by performing a search for the existing WOA that has been created and
  retrieving it. Process a &quot;new delivery&quot; to create a delivery record. The WOA
  should then be printed and will travel with the product through the inspection steps. As
  inspectors complete the inspections/tests, they will sign and date the paper WOA. Once all
  inspections/tests have been completed, the RITS database will need to be updated. The
  paper WOA is a quality record and is retained by the project.</p>
  <p>3. Update RITS database &#150; The database must be updated with supplier performance
  data only. This includes: quantity of items accepted and rejected, date of delivery, and
  number of nonconformance reports issued. </p>
</dir>

<p>Supplier performance reports are also available to check the performance history of
suppliers prior to purchasing products.</p>
