  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Dear Mary Lou,</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">My daughter, Tamara, is 14 years old and was
  diagnosed with endo in 1996 when she was 12. She is currently a member of the Association
  so this application is to renew her membership&#133;She would be especially interested in
  receiving newsletters relating to teenagers. Vol. 17, No. 4, 1996 was especially of
  interest to her.</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Please let us know if an Association teen newsletter
  is available. It is going on 2 years since her diagnosis and she feels little to no relief
  from the various medications tried. We continue our search and try to remain optimistic.
  Some days that is very hard.</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Thank you for the work you do for sufferers of endo.
  Tamara did her Grade 8 public speaking project on endometriosis this year.</font></small></strong></p>

  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">P.S. Tamara&#146;s Grandma is sending a donation

  <p align="center"><strong><small><font face="Arial">__________</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Dear Correspondence Network:</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">My name is Bryce and I am seventeen years old. I was
  operated on five weeks ago for stage 3 endometriosis. I am interested in the teen
  correspondence network.</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Thank you for your assistance.</font></small></strong></p>
  <p align="right"><strong><small><font face="Arial">Bryce, Illinois</font></small></strong></p>
  <p align="center"><strong><small><font face="Arial">__________</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Dear Endometriosis Association,</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">&#133;I am 21 years old and am looking for someone my
  age who has endo and complicating health problems associated with it. </font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">I also want to say thank you all for being there and
  the research you have done. When I was diagnosed I had never heard of endometriosis. The
  doctor I saw at that time never explained the seriousness of this disease. Needless to say
  as time went on and the pain increased I found another doctor who explained it better.
  Then I found out about the Association. At first I didn&#146;t have the money to join*
  until last October when things were at their worst. I ordered <i>The Endometriosis
  Sourcebook</i> and <i>Living with Endometriosis.</i> <i>(Editor's note: The </i>&quot;Living&quot;<i>
  book is no longer in print.) </i>They both helped me to deal with this disease and to know
  that I was not alone. My only regret is that I didn&#146;t find a doctor who took me
  seriously when I was 13 years old and on narcotic pain relievers that just took the edge
  off. I was 19 before my doctor decided maybe something was seriously wrong&#133;I believe
  that taking Synarel now is just prolonging what will eventually happen later in my life. I
  have come to terms that I will eventually have a hysterectomy&#133;I am determined to hold
  out a little longer since I want children. However, if it comes again to where my life has
  to stop, that&#146;s where I draw the line.</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Again, I am grateful for what you are doing and
  hopefully we can get the doctors to take seriously a 13-year-old in pain.</font></small></strong></p>
  <p align="right"><strong><small><font face="Arial">Dawn, Pennsylvania </font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">*The Association budgets for gift memberships for
  those unable to afford dues and a few members donate dues for others. For teens and young
  women, family members are often happy to pay their dues for them. It&#146;s something they
  can do to help! So ask your family or friends if you find yourself unable to join or ask
  about gift memberships.</font></small></strong></p>
  <p align="center"><strong><small><font face="Arial">__________</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">My daughter Gwen was recently diagnosed with
  endometriosis after spending the last 3-4 years trying to find a doctor who would take her
  pain seriously. She is just 19 yrs. old and was told over and over, &quot;it&#146;s just
  menstrual cramps.&quot; We knew that wasn&#146;t correct but had no idea until recently
  what it was. Unfortunately her condition is now fairly advanced, she is in almost constant
  pain along with other problems. We have finally found a doctor who understands this
  disease and takes her seriously.</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Arial"><small>I hope and pray we can get her condition under
  control. At 19 yrs. old her life has basically been put on hold, between the pain and
  complications she basically cannot function normally most</small><font size="1"> </font><small>days.</small></font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">She was a full time college student and now she
  can&#146;t even manage to sit through her classes. As a parent, as her mother, it is <u>unbearable</u>
  to watch my child in extreme pain, afraid, depressed and frightened. A client of mine who
  has endometriosis loaned me her copy of <i>The Endometriosis Sourcebook </i>which is how I
  found you. We (Gwen and I) were so thrilled that there was somewhere to turn for support
  and information. I can&#146;t tell you what it meant to us to find the EA! My 15 yr. old
  daughter, Colleen, was just diagnosed with endo. Colleen was showing signs of the same
  nature when Gwen was the same age. I&#146;m beginning to feel like we&#146;ve entered a
  nightmare.</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">If you could also include 50 of your free brochures
  we will make sure that they are made available at our doctor&#146;s office. If there is
  any other way that Gwen, Colleen, or myself can help we would be happy to do that. It is
  obvious this information needs to get out to women urgently. Gwen&#146;s doctor told us
  that had her condition been correctly diagnosed 3 years ago we would have had a lot more
  options. Because of her age she wasn&#146;t taken seriously. This began at age 15-16, and
  even though I was there with her trying to convince the doctors this wasn&#146;t
  &quot;just menstrual cramps&quot; we still were basically ignored and treated like crazy
  women. The medical profession&#146;s ignorance of this disease angers me terribly and if
  we can help change this and get the information to women before they wind up in my
  daughter&#146;s extreme condition we would be more than happy to help.</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Again, thank you for being there, and thank you for
  all your time and hard work. When we got your information packet it was like a lifeline of
  hope! </font></small></strong></p>

  <p align="left"><strong><small><font face="Arial">It is heartbreaking letters like these
  that have prompted the EA to start several new programs for girls and teens with
  endometriosis, from pre-teens to early 20s. Hard as endometriosis is for an adult woman,
  adults are likely to have more maturity, independence, and perhaps the life experience and
  skills to help them cope to some degree. Girls and teens usually do not have these, making
  them particularly vulnerable to the cruelties of this disease.</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Thanks to the assistance of freelance writer Christel
  Wendelberger, we have been able to update our teen brochure, adding graphics and making it
  more acceptable to mid and older teens. Our first teen brochure, in pink, has been used
  since 1986 and will continue to be used, in a slightly revised form, for pre-teen, middle
  school, and early teens. Members are invited to distribute the teen brochures to area
  schools, Girl Scouts, Planned Parenthood clinics, etc. Call Nancy Williams at (414)
  355-2200, 8:30 &#150; 5:00 CST, or e-mail Nancy with your request.</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Christel is also editing <i>TeenSource, </i>our new
  teen bulletin, which will be issued quarterly. Each four-page issue contains features
  especially geared to teens: a personal story of one girl&#146;s struggle with endo, a
  write-in advice or contact request column, an Advice from the Experts piece oriented to
  teens, and a glossary of terms used in the bulletin. We&#146;re looking forward to the
  feedback of young women on <i>TeenSource.</i></font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Because teens frequently wish to be in contact with
  other teens and their issues can be so different than the issues of older women, we are
  also establishing a Teen Contact Network. This network will operate like our
  correspondence networks. The teen member simply lets us know that she would like to be in
  contact with other teens, and her name is added to the list. The teenagers then make
  contact with each other in any way they wish&#151;by mail, phone, fax, e-mail. To
  participate in the Teen Contact Network, contact Pam McClendon at headquarters.</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Finally, we are establishing a Big Sister Program.
  Some teens with endometriosis do not have parents or relatives who understand the disease
  (although we urge these families to learn about it because of the tough decisions and
  support the teen needs). In addition, an experienced woman with endo can be a tremendous
  guide and role model for a teenager. Some Big Sisters will be in the same communities as
  their teen &quot;little sister&quot;; others may not be but will maintain contact with
  their &quot;little sister&quot; by phone, e-mail, mail, fax. In either case, we believe
  the coping tips, health tips, ideas on finding good medical care, and most of all, the
  listening skills of the Big Sister will be tremendously helpful to the youngster and her
  family. To participate in the Big Sister Program, contact Tina Wagner, Support Program
  Coordinator, at headquarters. </font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Because we are aware of so many families with
  endometriosis and because coping with this disease is a family challenge, we have
  established family memberships. Family membership includes a full regular membership with
  all the benefits of membership, including the international newsletter, as well as all the
  parts of the teen program&#151;the teen quarterly bulletin, teen brochures, Teen Contact
  Network, and the Big Sister Program. Family membership is $50 (the regular $35 for the
  regular membership plus $15 for the teen membership). We strongly recommend that family
  members of girls and teens be members and participate in local meetings, contact networks,
  read the high quality educational materials available from the Association, and keep up
  with new developments. A teenager cannot possibly navigate the complex waters of
  endometriosis treatment alone and needs informed parents and guardians to assist her with
  this. For that reason, teen memberships will not be provided separate from family
  membership.</font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Unfortunately, we have not been able to complete a
  videotape on teenagers and endometriosis and are still pursuing full funding for this.
  Anyone with leads, let us know! We are also considering adding a teen chat room to our
  EA-facilitated chat rooms. </font></small></strong></p>
  <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Together, we can help the next generation so they do
  not suffer the way we did! </font></small></strong></p>
