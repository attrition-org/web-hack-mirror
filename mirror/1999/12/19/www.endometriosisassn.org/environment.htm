<blockquote>
  <p><strong><font face="Arial">Today there are 5 million girls and women in the United
  States who have endometriosis, along with another half million in Canada and millions more
  worldwide.&nbsp; For those with endo, life is often a nightmare of misinformation, myths,
  taboos, improper diagnoses, and problematic hit and miss treatments. It is debilitating
  and incurable, often beginning as young as 10 or 11, and knows no racial or socioeconomic
  barriers.&nbsp; Current research findings indicate that endometriosis is really just the
  tip of a much larger iceberg, one that encompasses a range of health problems sharing one
  key commonality: hormonal/ immune dysfunction.</font></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>The results of a 1998 Endometriosis Association survey,
  presented at the 6<sup>th</sup> World Congress on Endometriosis, provide startling data
  about the disease.&nbsp; The percentage of women with endometriosis reporting symptoms
  before the age of 15 has jumped from 15 percent during the early to mid-1980s to 38
  percent in 1998.&nbsp; Early onset of the disease is highly correlated with increased
  severity.&nbsp; This disturbing trend provides a grim future for girls and young women as
  more will experience severe life disruption because of endo related disability.</strong></font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>There is mounting evidence that links endometriosis to
  dioxin (a group of toxic chemicals containing known and probable carcinogens), PCBs and
  other endocrine disruptors (chemicals which act like hormones in our bodies and disrupt
  the immune system).&nbsp; A 1992 study funded by the Endometriosis Association analyzed
  rhesus monkeys exposed for four years to TCDD (the most toxic form of dioxin). Two
  important conclusions of the study revealed that, &quot;the incidence of endometriosis was
  directly correlated with dioxin exposure and the severity of the disease was dependent
  upon the dose administered,&quot; and that, &quot;chronic exposure to the chemical toxin
  dioxin is directly correlated with an increased incidence in the development of
  endometriosis in rhesus monkeys.&quot;&nbsp; This landmark study has been followed by
  other research which supports these findings, including recent studies which reveal that
  women with endometriosis and their families have a greater risk of developing breast
  cancer, ovarian cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and melanoma.</strong></font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>In addition to these findings, the Environmental Protection
  Agency stated in its 1994 Dioxin Reassessment draft that the &quot;general population's
  current body burdens and exposures of dioxin are already at levels which affect our
  health.&quot;&nbsp; One of the health effects that the EPA specifically identifies is a
  &quot;higher probability of experiencing endometriosis and the reduced ability to
  withstand an immunological challenge.&quot; </strong></font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>The consequences of exposure to persistent chemicals like
  dioxin are serious and irreversible.&nbsp; Once in our bodies they remain there
  accumulating over time, mimicking natural hormones, disrupting our immune systems, and
  causing ill health.&nbsp; As families who suffer because of endometriosis, we have the
  right to know about our exposure to these toxins.&nbsp; As members of our communities, we
  have the right to demand the elimination of these chemicals from our environment in order
  to protect us all.&nbsp; The Endometriosis Association supports the public's right to know
  and actively participates in community efforts to stop exposure to dioxins so human health
  and the environment will no longer be compromised.</strong></font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>If you would like to learn more about toxins and their role
  in endometriosis, please contact&nbsp; <a href="registration2.htm">Kim Kelly,
  Environmental Coordinator</a>.&nbsp; The time has come for women with endometriosis to
  take action on this issue so that no family will again have to experience the horror of
  watching loved ones live with painful, chronic diseases <i>that could</i> <i>have been
  prevented</i>.&nbsp; Help us prevent another generation of endometriosis.</strong></font></p>
