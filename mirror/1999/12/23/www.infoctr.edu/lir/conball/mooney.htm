<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">John David Mooney is known internationally
for large scale public sculptures.&nbsp; The sculptures, which frequently
involve lighting effects, use existing landscape and architecture.&nbsp;
Mooney's sculptures, although temporary, have an unusual memory factor
and continue to be published and referred to long after they are no longer
on display.&nbsp; Past projects include a sculpture for the Dubrovnik Festival,
Croatia, celebrating residents' freedom from war; "Light Muse," the transformation
of the Tribune Tower into a light sculpture to celebrate the Tribune's
150th Anniversary in 1997; and "Star Dance," a 48-story light sculpture
commissioned for the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996.&nbsp; Mooney has been
invited to create a Millennium project for Rome that will tie together
Christianity, Judaism and Islam.&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Mooney created the John David Mooney Foundation
in 1975 to emphasize the spiritual and social aspects of being an artist.&nbsp;
The Foundation is dedicated to promoting public art, with special emphasis
on community access and involvement in the entire art process and to presenting
the work of international artists and architects.&nbsp; As Artistic Director
of the Foundation, he conducts a training program for apprentice artists
from around the world.&nbsp; The Foundation's "Chicago Prize" program is
a residency and exhibitions program awarded to outstanding international
artists.&nbsp; In addition to the "Chicago Prize" program, the foundation
hosts an exhibition and lecture series by cutting-edge international artists.</FONT>&nbsp;
