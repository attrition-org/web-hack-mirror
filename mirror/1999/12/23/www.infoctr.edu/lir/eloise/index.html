<td VALIGN=TOP><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Despite the fact
that she was born at the turn of the 20th century, Eloise ReQua would probably
share more in common with women of the nineties and even the 21st century.&nbsp;
A 1924 history and economics graduate of Bryn Mawr College, she also pursued
graduate studies in international trade and attended the Geneva School
of International Studies. A world traveler, Miss ReQua's keen knowledge
of foreign affairs was grounded in a singular farsighted philosophy: in
order to understand people it is essential to understand their history,
culture, geography, and economy.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To this end, she founded
a unique international library that provided a holistic view of each country.
The materials she began collecting are the heart of today's <a href="http://www.infoctr.edu/lir/coll.htm">Library
of International Relations.</a></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Miss ReQua's engaging ways
and international friendships led to the LIR becoming an official depository
library of documents of all major international organizations.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In 1954, the LIR held its
first Consular Ball. The Ball provides the LIR with an elegant annual fundraiser
that pays tribute to the <a href="http://www.infoctr.edu/lir/consul">Chicago
Consular Corps.</a></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In 1983, the Library's Board
of Trustees chose the Chicago-Kent College of Law as the permanent home
of the LIR. Today, the staff of the Library is committed to continuing
the legacy of Eloise ReQua: to promote international understanding and
friendship.&nbsp;</font></font></td>
