Apart from the ambiguity inherent in its symbols, a statute suffers from dubities.  It is not an equation or a formula representing a clearly marked process, nor is it an expression of an individual thought to which is imparted the definiteness a single authorship can give.  A statute is an instrument of government partaking of its practical purposes but also of its infirmaties and limitations, of its awkward and groping efforts. ---></td></tr>

<font size="+1" color="black"><i>Researching the legislative history of a federal statute is the process of examining the reports and records of hearings and debates that preceded the enactment of a law in an effort to determine what Congress intended in passing the law in the manner that it did.  The need to examine the legislative history of a particular law usually arises in the context of litigation.  The statute at issue may be ambiguous and the court will request guidance in applying it.
<p>
Because there is a vast amount of information, both government and commercial, available on federal legislative actions, you may be intimidated upon being assigned the task of compiling a legislative history for a federal statute.  However, while the materials at times may be extensive, there are effective techniques and methods that will enable you to compile such a history in an efficient, timely, and cost-effective manner.
