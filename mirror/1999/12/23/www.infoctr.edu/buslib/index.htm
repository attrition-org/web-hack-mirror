<h4>The <A href="http://www.stuart.iit.edu">Stuart School of Business</A> is supported by the uniquely multi-disciplined collection within the 
<A href="../index.html">Information Center</A> at the Downtown Center of the Illinois Institute of Technology.  The Stuart collection has been integrated with the overall Information Center collection, allowing the user to draw easily on the combined resources of the Stuart School, the Law Library, and the Library of International Relations, bringing together their outstanding resources in business, law, international relations, and the social sciences.

The Stuart collection, while wide reaching, is particularly strong in those areas supporting the programs of the Stuart Business School--financial markets and operations management.  The collection is constantly being enriched in order to better serve the needs of Stuart students and faculty.
