<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">In 1991, the Chicago-Kent College of Law
Library and Library of International Relations became the world's first
electronic library when it brought up its imaging system, eLOISe. eLOISe
is a computer-based system that transmits an exact image of each page of
any document at a user's command. <A HREF="subscr.htm">Subscribers</A>
are able to view, print, and fax library materials any time of the day,
from anywhere in the world. This technology represents a giant leap forward
for attorneys, businesspeople, and scholars who need rapid access to data
from remote locations.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">eLOISe contains a wide variety of resources
ranging all the way from international law and business to resources which
are of local and state interest. One of the most recent additions to eLOISe
is the <A HREF="http://www.infoctr.edu/environ/">Pollution Prevention Resources</A>
at Chicago-Kent College of Law.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Whatever the research need, clients have
the assistance of the knowledgable, professional librarians of <A HREF="refres.htm">Reference
and Research Services.</A></FONT>
