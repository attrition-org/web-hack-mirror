largest law school libraries in the country.  The I.J. Berkson
Reading Room (pictured right) is a modern reproduction of a
traditional nineteenth century reading room, with a 23-foot high vaulted
ceiling and a stunning view of the Chicago skyline.

elder law, intellectual property law, and law practice are areas
of strength in the law collection.
