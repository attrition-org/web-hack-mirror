<p align="center"><small>WASHINGTON--Police here will be on heightened alert for terrorism
on New Year's Eve in light of the arrest of an Algerian-born man caught with bomb
components at the Canadian border, Washington's police chief said today. <br>
Chief Charles Ramsey stressed, however, that &quot;there is no reason to believe that
Washington, D.C. has been targeted at this time.&quot; <br>
Ramsey spoke to reporters at a briefing by D.C. mayor Anthony Williams who announced that
computers running traffic lights, emergency services and other critical city programs were
100 percent ready for the changeover to 2000. <br>
The police chief said that the heightened alert ordered for Washington was similar to
upgraded security at last April's three-day, 50th anniversary summit of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) here. <br>
&quot;We would be less than responsible if we didn't take certain precautions, especially
in light of the fact that an individual was arrested in the U.S. with explosives,&quot; he
said. <br>
The United States has been tightening security along its borders since the arrest Dec. 14
of Ahmed Ressam, 32, accused of trying to enter the country from Canada with the
ingredients for a powerful bomb. He is in custody in Seattle. <br>
Earlier Monday, the State Department said it was boosting security at U.S. diplomatic
installations at home and abroad, and setting up evacuation teams to deal with any
terrorism or other emergencies at the start of the year 2000. <br>
The department warned Dec. 11 that it had &quot;credible information&quot; that guerrillas
were planning attacks on U.S. citizens overseas, notably at New Year's gatherings. <br>
In the United States, the State Department has developed contingency plans to make sure
that its 105 domestic facilities are &quot;adequately protected&quot; and can perform
essential business during the date change. <br>
Mayor Williams, meanwhile, said that of the city's 378 computer systems, 100 percent of
those that run critical city services and 96 percent of all systems are ready for the New
Year. <br>
Washington D.C.--declared on the edge of bankruptcy in 1995--only began debugging hundreds
of computer systems that run everything from drinking water purification to 911 emergency
services 18 months ago. <br>
The Y2K bug prevents some computers from distinguishing 2000 from 1900 or another year
because of old shortcuts that recorded the year with only two digits in key date fields.
Computers with the error could malfunction or shut down.</small> </p>
