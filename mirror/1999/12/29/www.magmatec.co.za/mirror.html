BTW A friendly message to Telkom, bring back the R7 deal for all the dialup l00sers. If telkom doesnt respond bef0re
friday to bring back the R7 deal before 31 December 1999, we ask of every south african citizen to pick up their
phones ( and keep it off the hook) at this time 23:00 on the 4th of january 2000. Exactly on that time and keep
hit off the hook for 5 minutes. If everyone in the country does that , Telkom will feel the loss and they will
have to obey. Citizens we are doing you a favour, now you gotta help us stop this monopoly. pj33r Uz f0r w3 h4v3
