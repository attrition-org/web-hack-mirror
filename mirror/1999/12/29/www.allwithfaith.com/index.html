<center>Better late then never..im here..i will try to make things clear
as i think they are in my way..
<br>i dont have any intention to flame or hurt anyone..if anyone of you
get hurt or feel insulted
<br>then i am sorry..I dont want to write too much but i will sure use
the biggest medium to&nbsp;
<br>voice my opinion because its my right and ive been doing this for long.
<br>Most&nbsp; people deface websites to get fame, they want to be known..some
do it for a cause..
<br>some do it to show their skills..some want to show the vulnerabilites
and some do it because
<br>they can! Everything is linked with hacked@attrition.org
<br>How are you going to know if "who" did "what" for "which reason"? How
is the person
<br>supposed to tell everyone what he did and why he did?? Either its for
fame, to show skills or
<br>even for a cause, everything needs attention. Attrion.org's mirrors
are visited by almost
<br>uncountable number of people on daily basis. So that make it an excellent
place to "advertise"
<br>for anything.
<br>Lets talk about us..Pakistan Hackerz Club..YES, we are defacing for
a cause and YES we
<br>need attention. Though defacing a web site is illegal but that makes
the issue more serious.
<br>This defacing for a cause is to show the people what is going "behind
the scenes"..and to
<br>make them know about the "real facts" of the respective casue. Everything
we ever
<br>put on a defaced site can be verified from anywhere. You can match
the dates, the number
<br>of people killed or the places where that happened.
<br>If we deface for Kashmir, against India..then the target audience should
be the ones other
<br>then Indians..Indians already know what actually is happening, the
majority will never
<br>agree to the facts in the name of "patriotism". What we actually need
is the support of
<br>people who were not concerned with the issue before, noone will give
ears to something
<br>they dont know about. I hope everyone support human rights, and i think
most of the people
<br>who visit these sites do believe in it. People who believe in human
rights will sure get
<br>concerned with the issue when they will read or see about what "actually"
is going on...
<br>A number of emails to the respective departments or organizations from
nations other then
<br>the ones suffering will sure make them atleast realise, if not convince
to act urgent...and that is
<br>going to be a positive boost for the cause.
<br>I cant go and fight for all the nations suffering, but i can do something
to make the world
<br>know about the injustice going around. Defacing a websites will cost
nothing to the target.
<br>They just have to rename a page and fix the hole...their page is defaced
and they are the
<br>target, its their fault for not securing properly..the vulnerability
was ALREADY there! So
<br>even if there is a cost involved its nothing to do with the defacement..they
still had to put
<br>that money if they have found the hole for themselves. Its better to
have a single page
<br>renamed then to loose all the data.
<br>United Nations is responsible to solve disputes among different countries..The
United States
<br>being the "super power" loves to intercept any country in any of their
internal affairs, they
<br>do use their powers when they see some income..but loves to neglect
in the same way when
<br>it comes to the "real" problems. Dont you think they are to be blamed?
You just cant compare
<br>a human life with money..a person killed is related to many people,
just sit and think about
<br>your feelings if you loose your loved ones. The people getting killed
are not just 1 or 2 to
<br>count..there and hundreds and thousands of them..think about millions
of people attached to
<br>these thousands..think about their feelings..im not getting emotional..its
just that i know i can
<br>feel things the same way..hope you understand..
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Another imporatant thing to notice is that those last two hacks by
"<b>antichrist</b>" wasnt done by
<br>him..infact..some someone faked as him..he is very dissapointed so
pls refrain doing that again..
