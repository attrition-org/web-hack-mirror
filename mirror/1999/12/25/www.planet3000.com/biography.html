<p align="left"><font color="#400000"><strong>Or should I say, who am I?&nbsp; My name is
Sebastian Harrison and I am the sole proprietor of Planet 3000.&nbsp; I principally live
and work in Rome, Italy.** &nbsp; I also have two associates in the USA.&nbsp; Rather than
emphasize Planet 3000 and speak about our low prices, number 1 service and so on, in this
&quot;who are we?&quot; section, I prefer to share with you a brief biography of my life
in the hope that you can understand why and how Planet 3000 came to exist.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#400000"><strong>I was born in Rome, Italy in 1965 of
American parents.&nbsp; My mother is one of three daughters of the founder and President
of American International Pictures, James H. Nicholson.&nbsp; AIP no longer exists but
many of you will remember the films they produced - all the Vincent Price, Edgar Allen Poe
movies, the Beach Blanket Bingo genre movies with Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon and
the majority of the sci-fi and youth-oriented films of the 50s such as &quot;Attack of the
50-Foot Woman&quot; and &quot;I was a Teenage Werewolf&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; My father is a
(mostly) retired actor named Richard Harrison.&nbsp; He has starred in over 120 (yes,
120!) mostly B-rate action films such as Spaghetti Westerns, Hercules type films and 007
type films.&nbsp; (Click <a href="http://www.mindlogic.com/rh.html">here</a> for a list
and pictures of some of his films.)&nbsp; He made many of his films in Italy, which
explains why I was born in there.</strong></font><br>

<p align="left"><font color="#400000"><strong>Although born in Rome, I grew up between
there and Los Angeles and I also spent a portion of my childhood in Spain.&nbsp; All of my
schooling (except for kindergarden, if you can consider that &quot;schooling&quot; and
high school which was at Notre Dame in Rome) was done in Los Angeles.&nbsp; I went to UCLA
for college and graduated with degrees in Political Science and Italian Literature. &nbsp;
While I put a fair amount of emphasis on school - at least from the age of 16 on up, I
believe that most of my education has been informal.&nbsp; My father's occupation has
taken him around the world many times and my father took me and my other two brothers with
him every chance he got.&nbsp; Most people who like traveling refer to it as having been
bit by the &quot;traveling bug.&quot;&nbsp; I wouldn't describe it as that since the
fondness for traveling is not something that occurred but rather is something almost
inherent.&nbsp; My first memories are of foreign places.&nbsp; I have traveled to many
countries but I think that to really get the taste of a place you have to live or work
there.&nbsp; I've had the opportunity to live in Japan, Germany, Spain, Norway, the
Philippines, Ethiopia, Turkey and of course Italy and the US.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#400000"><strong>I mentioned before that I am a firm believer
in informal education, not necessarily as an alternative to a formal education but rather
as a supplement.&nbsp; Many of my experiences have been been tied to my father's work and
also my work - not so much as the work in itself because my father has never really
frequented his peers but rather the people that you have the opportunity to meet as a
result of being an actor. &nbsp; Artists, writers, sports figures (mostly boxers) and
politicians were constantly going in and out of the house.&nbsp; If you have an open mind
you can learn just as much from a boxer (and here I will use concrete examples) such as
Marvin Hagler as you can from a writer like Gore Vidal.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#400000"><strong>Fresh out of high school and before going to
college, I fell into acting. &nbsp; It sounded like a good idea, after all, if my father
did 120 I could surely do a few and the opportunity was pounding at the door.&nbsp; My
father had written a screen play that he intended to do called &quot;Scalps.&quot;&nbsp;
He decided not to do it so he sold the script.&nbsp; The producer who bought it asked him
if he knew anyone around 18 years old, blond and that could speak English for another
movie he was producing.&nbsp; My father mentioned he had a son and a few screen tests and
2 months later I was in Spain doing the lead in &quot;<a href="whiteapache.html">White
Apache</a>.&quot;&nbsp; After that I did a small part in a film my father did produce
called &quot;Three Men on Fire,&quot; a few other films, a couple of which I had the lead
including one by Lucio Fulci (Sadoma's Ghosts), and then I did a two and one-half year
leading role in an Italian situation comedy based on a Japanese cartoon series &quot;Kiss
Me Licia.&quot; &nbsp; The series was quite ridiculous but was a huge success.&nbsp; But I
was 24 and all my friends had degrees so my attitude was, &quot;it's now or never&quot;
and I went back to the US and went first to a local college and then UCLA.&nbsp; (I still
do act, however.&nbsp; Last year I had a lead role in film shot in Ethiopia.)</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><strong><font color="#400000">How does one go from this background to
having a site on the internet that deals with video equipment and electronics?!?!&nbsp;
Well, at first glance there does not seem to be any correlation but really there is.&nbsp;
I've always had this interest in cameras and movies plus, living the life that I have
lived the last thing that I wanted to do was have a 9-5 office job.&nbsp; I'm too
independent for that.&nbsp; I need to have my own business, set my own hours and not be
confined to one place.&nbsp; This is perfect for me.&nbsp; With modern technology I can be
anywhere and still work.&nbsp; The very first sale I made which was a large order from
AT&amp;T, I was in Capri.&nbsp; This is only the beginning.&nbsp; I also have another site
where I combine once again what I know and love with business.&nbsp; This site has
products from Italy and gives free information about travel in Italy.&nbsp; Thanks for
taking the time to read this.&nbsp; And by the way, comments are always more than welcome!</font></strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong><font color="#400000">**&nbsp; Planet 3000 has recently merged
with another company (May 22, 1999) in order to accomodate our growing business.&nbsp; We
are doing business under our corporate company of Buyundercost.com where we will be
selling electronics for <em>under</em> our cost!&nbsp; Sounds insane but it is true!
&nbsp; Since the conception of&nbsp; Buyundercost.com I have returned to the US
(California) in order to take Planet 3000 and Buyundercost.com to new heights!</font></strong></p>
