<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A multistandard VCR is a VCR that can play different standards of tapes including PAL,
SECAM, MESECAM and NTSC.&nbsp; Most multistandard VCRs are capable of playing at least
PAL, MESECAM and NTSC but those that play and record true SECAM are a rare breed. &nbsp;
Multistandard VCRs are usually more feature loaded than NTSC VCRs designed for use in the
USA.&nbsp; Like NTSC VCRs, there is a wide range of multistandard VCRs to chose from with
prices varying depending on the number of heads, the brand name, the system capabilities,
whether or not there are tuners and the added features it has.&nbsp; Most multistandard
VCRs, and the ones we sell unless otherwise specified,&nbsp; are full autovoltage.</p>

<p>There is often a misconception regarding what it is that a multistandard VCR is capable
of doing.&nbsp; It is not designed to allow you to watch foreign tapes on your American
TV.&nbsp; What a multistandard VCR does is to <em>read </em>foreign formats of
tapes.&nbsp; For example, if you insert a PAL tape from Europe into a multistandard VCR,
technically the VCR will have no problem reading the tape.&nbsp; The problem is that the
signal being outputted to your TV is still a PAL signal and unless you have a <a
href="tv.html">multistandard TV</a> or a PAL TV you won't be able to view the tape.&nbsp; </p>

<p>There are 4 different ways of being able to view a tape.</p>

<p>The first, get a <a href="vcr.html">multistandard VCR</a> and get a <a href="tv.html">multistandard
television</a>.&nbsp; With this combination you can view American and most foreign tapes
whether you are using this system here in the US or abroad.&nbsp; The advantages of having
a multistandard VCR and TV are that you can use them most anywhere in the world (good for
diplomats and other people who move around a lot) and you get to see your tapes in their
original splendor, without any transfer loss.&nbsp; The downside is that you can not
convert from one system to another, or rather, you cannot send friends and family a copy
of an NTSC tape transferred into PAL nor can you receive a tape that you get from Europe,
make a copy of it into the NTSC format and watch it on any VCR.<br>
<br>
You may also get a multistandard VCR with a built in converter.&nbsp; With a <a
href="convert.html">multisystem VCR/converter </a>combo you can watch any tape in the
world on any television in the world.&nbsp; You can also make copies in other standards in
order to send to other people.&nbsp; This is the simplest and most pratical approach and
it is also the most common.&nbsp; Until very recently the better units were a considerable
amount of money above $1000.&nbsp; Now you can get a excellent unit for under that amount.
&nbsp; Aiwa also markets a mass consumer model called the <a href="aiwaconv.html">MX 100</a>
which we sell for under $600 (this retails in stores for around $800)&nbsp;&nbsp; This is
a very low price for a converting VCR.&nbsp; A couple of words of caution regarding the MX
100.&nbsp; First of all, it takes a short cut approach in converting and actually
approximates the feet per second in converting from PAL to NTSC.&nbsp; This causes
distortion in the video and audio aspects of the conversion - often resulting in ghost
lines, color bleeding and audio loss.&nbsp; Also, if you intend on bring this overseas,
think twice.&nbsp; The Aiwa does not have PAL tuners and therefore you cannot make copies
from a broadcast source in that format.&nbsp; The main concern with the Aiwa however is
durability.&nbsp; It seems like they were not designed to last the test of time.&nbsp; If
your budget can afford it, do yourself the favor and get a more reliable unit such as the <a
href="convgovideo.html">Go Video GV 10W</a>, the <a href="samsconv.html">Samsung SV 4000</a>
or the <a href="convpanas.html">Panasonic AGW2</a>.</p>

<p>A third option is to get a <a href="vcr.html">multistandard VCR</a> and a free-standing
VCR, such as the <a href="tenlabd.html">Tenlab</a>.&nbsp; This is a great solution for the
professional or for those who demand top quality.&nbsp; There are even a couple units with
S-VHS input/output.&nbsp; This is desirable for converting from higher than VHS sources,
such as digital, Super VHS or hi-8.&nbsp; The Tenlab even has the capability of <a
href="macro.html">defeating macrovision</a>. The price for a multisystem VCR and a Tenlab
converter is highly competitive and up until recently, this combination was the way to go
for those who wanted better quality and reliability than the Aiwa.&nbsp; If you need
S-VHS, this is still the right solution. Recently, however, we have been able to sell the
Go Video GV 10 W for a price lower than combining a multisystem VCR and the Tenlab. &nbsp;
Until we run out of stock, this is the way to go!&nbsp; You can read more about it <a
href="convgovideo.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The last possibility is to use our <a href="tconv.html">conversion service</a>. If you
have only a few tapes that need to be converted this is a good option.&nbsp; We use the
Tenlab converter, Go Video converting VCR and the Panasonic.&nbsp; We provide fast,
efficient service using the best VHS cassette tapes at the lowest prices that we have seen
on the internet.<br>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000FF"><big>Which multisystem VCRs do we recommend?</big></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF"><big>&nbsp;</big></font></p>

<p>For PAL-NTSC standards we highly recommend the <a href="vcrjvc.html">JVC HR-DD857MS.</a><br>
JVC 857 Stereo multistandard VCR. It&#146;s advanced features and especially, the picture
quality make it our #1 choice by far. Combine that VCR with any of our TVs (our
multistandard <a href="tvsony.html">SONY WEGAs</a> are the finest image quality TVs ever
invented surpassed only by High Definition TV ($15,000).</p>

<p>Or, to watch your tapes on your existing TV and to be able to make copies in different
standards:</p>

<p>Combine the JVC 857 with the TENLAB TR-21 Digital Converter with S-VIDEO and RCA
connectors and you have our top choices for a 2 unit solution.</p>

<p>Do you need to watch or convert SECAM tapes in full color, as well as PAL-NTSC?</p>

<p><a href="vcrtoshiba.html">TOSHIBA VW-36 </a>(monophonic sound).</p>

<p><a href="vcrtoshiba.html">TOSHIBA VW-56</a> (stereo with stereo tuners).</p>

<p>These VCRs play and record SECAM tapes in FULL COLOR, something most other VCRs can not
do.</p>

<p>For a single unit solution our top choice is the <a href="convgovideo.html">GOVIDEO
GV-10W</a>.</p>

<p>This Stereo Converting VCR is actually the same unit as the famous <a
href="convpanas.html">PANASONIC AG-W2 </a>but even better! And the Go Video is half the
price!</p>
