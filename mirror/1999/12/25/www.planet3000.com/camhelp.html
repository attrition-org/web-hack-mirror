<p><big><strong>There are several factors to consider before purchasing a camcorder.&nbsp;
First, you must decide on what format is right for you.</strong></big></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Camcorders have come a long way since their introduction to the mass market in
1988. &nbsp; Back then you had to pack a full-sized camcorder AND a VCR, the two being
connected via cable in order to be able to record whatever was being recorded.&nbsp;
Battery life was short, camcorder features were even shorter and prices were steep.&nbsp;
To make matters worse, if you weren't' some sort of power lifter or didn't have your own
personal film crew to help you, there was a lot of struggling going on between the
videophile and his equipment.&nbsp; Camcorders were certainly not for everyone.&nbsp;
Nowadays you can get much better quality of the video and sound, more features and special
effects - and you can literally stick one of these camcorders in your pocket.</strong></p>

    <br>
    <br>
    There are two main reasons for buying a full-sized camcorder.&nbsp; The first is they are
    inexpensive.&nbsp; These are the biggest, least convenient and often the least
    sophisticated.&nbsp; Not every one wants to lug around these behemoths and generally
    speaking they are the worst selling camcorders in circulation.&nbsp; Ironically, many
    semi-professional videographers favor them for their shoots.&nbsp; Think about this, if
    you are paying someone a couple of grand to shoot your wedding and he pulls out from his
    pocket a pint-sized camcorder, how much credibility would you give this guy?&nbsp; A major
    reason that these videographers use this format is that it looks more impressive than the
    smaller formats and therefore the person forking out the dough for the video is
    content.&nbsp; Also, and to give credit where credit is due, full-sized VHS camcorders are
    also relatively easy to keep steady since they are supported on your shoulder.</b></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Compact VHS (VHS-C)</b></font></p>
    <p><b>Chronologically, this format followed the full-sized camcorder.&nbsp; The cassette
    is about half the size of its predecessor and consequently the dimensions of the camcorder
    itself have been reduced dramatically - yet not anywhere near to those of modern digital
    camcorders.&nbsp; VHS-C tapes have a limited playing time (about 30 minutes to one hour)
    and they require an adapter to play back through a VHS VCR.</b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">8mm</font></p>
    <p>This format has allowed the dimensions of the camcorder to be drastically reduced while
    maintaining the same resolution as the full size and the compact camcorders.&nbsp; Due to
    their affordability and relative compact size, this format has allowed the camcorder to
    become a mainstream consumer product.&nbsp; You can connect the cable from the camcorder
    to go directly to the TV allowing you to play your tapes while using the camcorder as a
    video cassette player.</p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF">hi-8mm</font></p>
    <p>The hi-8 cassette is the same size as the 8-mm but it has the advantage of being able
    to display a video resolution of about 400 horizontal lines.&nbsp; To take advantage of
    this increased clarity you will need a TV that has an S-Video input.&nbsp; Other
    advantages are similar to those of the 8mm although often manufacturers will add extra
    features to their hi-8 camcorders allowing them to further justify the more expensive
    price as compared to the normal 8mm camcorders.</p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF">Digital Camcorders</font></p>
    <p>Digital camcorders are the latest and hottest format camcorders available on today's
    market.&nbsp; These camcorders use a small digital tape cassette that allows for at least
    2 important outcomes.&nbsp; First, data transfer does not degenerate as analog tape does.
    &nbsp; This is important for example, when you upload images to your computer.&nbsp; You
    will not lose any of the image quality, which can be up to 500 lines of resolution. &nbsp;
    Another very important aspect that is not always taken into consideration is the size
    factor.&nbsp; While not all digital camcorders are small, there are certain advantages
    that small, pocketable camcorders have over larger, more bulky ones.&nbsp; A small,
    literally &quot;pocketable&quot; camcorder will almost inevitably be used more often than
    one that is a burden to haul around.&nbsp; A camcorder that requires a separate carrying
    case to lug it around in will not be used as readily as one that you can slip into your
    pocket and forget about.&nbsp; With a pocketable camcorder, you can take it with you
    anywhere without the pressure of feeling obligated to use it as you would with a more
    burdensome camcorder.&nbsp; The advantage of a larger camcorder is that it is usually more
    comfortable to grasp while you are using it and also easier to keep still.&nbsp; Nowadays,
    most camcorders have such refined steady shot mechanisms that this is really no longer an
    issue.&nbsp; Still, if you don't mind carrying around an extra load and you like the idea
    of having a little more space between the buttons and controls or want a larger LCD
    monitor, you might opt for a larger digital camcorder.</b></td>

<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Whatever the format you chose, you might want to consider
several points before you select the model.</strong></font></p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="0" width="471" height="110" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="471" height="110">&nbsp;<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Does the camcorder have
    steady shot?</strong></font><br>
    <strong><br>
    Camcorders without steady shot are less expensive than those that do have it.&nbsp;
    Usually, only the least expensive camcorders are without this feature.&nbsp; This is one
    feature that if you can afford to upgrade to you should.&nbsp; While many features are
    usually not vital and are basically gadgets, camcorders without this feature are a real
    mess.&nbsp; Without steady shot you will get images that are annoying to watch. &nbsp; No
    matter how steady you may think you are holding the camcorder, if your camcorder does not
    have this feature the result will be shaking, jerking and jostling images that will make
    you think that you were experiencing an earthquake during the time that you were shooting
    the video.The only exception for not needing a camcorder with this feature is if you will
    be using a tripod all or most of the time.</strong></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Do you need PAL or NTSC?</strong></font></p>
    <p><strong>If you don't know what PAL and NTSC are, chances are you need NTSC.&nbsp; NTSC
    is the North American format of television and video and PAL is the format that is used
    most other places in the world.&nbsp; If you plan on using your camcorder in the US you
    will want to get an NTSC camcorder.&nbsp; If you travel between two or more countries that
    use both of these formats and are not sure which format you should get, note that not only
    is PAL a better format than NTSC but PAL equipment is usually better manufactured.</strong></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Do you need a color viewfinder?</strong></font></p>
    <p><strong>Probably not.&nbsp; This is a feature that does not enhance your videos in any
    way whatsoever - and it is an expensive feature.&nbsp; Most people agree that a black and
    white viewfinder actually gives you a sharper perspective and clearer depth perception
    than a color viewfinder.</strong></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Do you want an LCD monitor?</strong></font></p>
    <p><strong>This feature is worth the investment.&nbsp; Not only is it easier to see what
    you are shooting but this is also a useful and fun gimmick.&nbsp; You can use the LCD
    monitor to review what you shot just moments after you shoot it.&nbsp; You can, for
    example have someone shoot your decent of a ski slope, review what was shot and use this
    to correct your form.&nbsp; Or if you are shooting a home movie you can review the shot
    and if it is not up to par, reshoot.&nbsp; These are just 2 examples of how the LCD
    monitor can further your enjoyment of your camcorder.</strong></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Battery length.</strong></font></p>
    <p><strong>One of the most frustrating occurrences during shooting is having the battery
    run out.&nbsp; When you buy a camcorder you will inevitably find that the manufacturer has
    supplied the basic battery in the box.&nbsp; You might consider purchasing an extra
    battery with your camcorder, or better yet, a higher stamina battery.</strong></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Extras and Accessories.</strong></font></p>
    <p><strong>We don't sell &quot;package&quot; deals with tripods, cases, etc.&nbsp; Most
    companies that do will give you the worst quality accessories imaginable.&nbsp; It is
    always better to chose your accessories personally and make sure that they are right for
    you.&nbsp; Not all tripods, carrying cases, etc. are the same.&nbsp; More often than not,
    you will be disappointed if you purchase a package for $50 or $60.&nbsp; The carrying case
    will be made of cheap material and will probably be too bulky, the tripod will be flimsy
    and so on, depending on what else is in this &quot;offer.&quot;</strong></td>
