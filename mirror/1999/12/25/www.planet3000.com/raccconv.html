<h2 align="center"><font color="#FF0000">What Multi Standard Converter do you need?</font></h2>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">First of all, what is the difference between a MULTI STANDARD VCR and a
STANDARDS CONVERTER? What do you need to do what you want?<br>
<br>
A Multi Standard VCR will play PAL/SECAM/NTSC tapes ONLY on a TV of the VHS tape standard
you have, therefore requiring the purchase of a TV as well as a Multi Standard VCR. <br>
A Standards Converter allows you to PLAY any standard tape on any standard TV and also, to
convert the standard of the original tape allowing a copy to be made in a NEW TV standard.
These are either combination VCR/Converters or Stand-Alone Converters. All of ours are
Digital and are TRUE Converters. We don't sell &quot;transcodifiers&quot; or analog
converters and we strongly advise against them.<br>
[Please don't be fooled by pseudo-converters! Ask for our FAQ file explaining the TRUTH
about this before buying from anyone.]<br>
This means you can watch any TV STANDARD VHS tape in the world (PAL/SECAM/NTSC) on any TV
in the world, whether PAL, SECAM or NTSC TV or make an actual copy of any standard tape to
any other standard, literally altering the electronic information and send it to a friend
for him to watch on his own local TV. <br>
If you plan on opening a STANDARDS CONVERSION business you'll need a Converter (and 1 or 2
VCRs). The best quality I sell are the TR-10SP by TENLAB, SAMSUNG 300W or 4000W, and the
Panasonic AG-W2. With the TR-10SP &quot;box&quot; you'll need 2 VCRs, one in each of the
standards (or MULTI-STANDARD-s) you'll be using. </p>

<p align="center">Here's a quick overview of the Converters <strong>Planet 3000 </strong>sells.</p>

<hr>

<p align="left">The LEAST expensive way of converting PAL-NTSC is the</p>

<p align="center"><a href="aiwaconv.html"><strong><font color="#FF0000">AIWA MX-100</font></strong></a></p>

<p align="left">VCR/converter combo for around $600 (price and stock varies), however, you
get what you pay for. The MX-100 tries to give you a lot but the quality suffers across
the board. It DOES however use a digital chipset.</p>

<p>It has various negatives such as:</p>

<p>No tuners for PAL-SECAM countries so it can not receive television broadcasts from
cable or antenna sources overseas. All the other solutions as listed below have
PAL-SECAM-NTSC tuners (but for the PANASONICE AG-W2) so they are truly worldwide units. </p>

<p>You will lose approx. 1 ½ to 2 generations of picture quality when converting with the
AIWA MX-100 whereas with all the converters a PAL-SECAM tape converted to NTSC, for
example, will be virtually identical to the original and many people can't tell them
apart.</p>

<p>What is a &quot;generation&quot;? When you make a copy of any video tape that copy is
called a first generation copy. It will lose picture and sound quality. When you make a
copy FROM THAT COPY the resulting copy is called a &quot;2<font size="3"><sup>nd</sup>
generation&quot; copy and the image quality will suffer even more.</font></p>

<p>The AIWA MX-100 has no digital effects, no editing features and it&#146;s
&quot;consumer grade&quot; construction means it will probably last only a couple of years
before you it starts giving you problems. The other solutions will last for many years.</p>

<a href="convpanas.html"><big><strong><font color="#FF0000">Panasonic AG-W2</font></strong></big></a></p>

<p align="left">This is the updated version of the fabled and original VCR/Converter - the
AG-W1. This is the most expensive converting VCR on the market yet is virtually the same
thing as the Samsung and the Go Video.&nbsp; All three are made by Samsung.&nbsp; Compare
the specs and image of the <a href="convpanas.html">AG W2</a> and the <a href="convgovideo.html">Go Video GV 10 W</a>.&nbsp; They are virtually identical!</p>

<p align="center"><a href="convgovideo.html"><font color="#FF0000"><big><strong>Go Video
GV 10 W</strong></big></font></a></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF">Over the last couple of years and especially
recently, the prices on converting VCRs has dropped considerably.&nbsp; The Go Video is no
exception.&nbsp; This is virtually the same unit as the Samsung SV 4000 and the Panasonic
AG W2.&nbsp; You get a lot of bang for the buck with this unit.&nbsp; In terms of
price/quality it contends with the Tenlab for the number one spot.</font></p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><a href="tenlabd.html"><font color="#FF0000"><big><strong>Tenlab
Converters</strong></big></font></a></p>

<p align="left"><br>
Still, only the TENLAB products have all the options, can be upgraded as even better
technology arrives, have phase (for NTSC color) and gain control knobs, are made in the
USA. They also have a full world-wide warranty good for all countries, including the USA.
For what it does it's amazingly inexpensive. <br>
In sum, the TENLAB can do more than all the others, is a truly superior converter and, as
I've sold so very many, I can tell you: you will NOT be disappointed!</p>
