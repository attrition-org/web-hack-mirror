<center>Ok. Enuf is ENUF. I was gonna keep quiet. But im sick and tired of seeing all these lame ass RDS hack's.
Hacking is all about FAME now. Its no longer about bringing a message. Its like the only reason people hack any more is so they can get there name on attrition.
Just look at all the past hacks there all RDS kiddie's. If these people would get real skills then they would learn how lame rds hackign is.</center><!-- www.attrition.org web hack mirror - watermark or something -->
