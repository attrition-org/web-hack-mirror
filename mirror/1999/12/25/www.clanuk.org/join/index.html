<H2>So You Want To Join?</H2>

<P>Great! But how do I go about it? You ask.</P>

<P>Okay here's the deal. ClanUK is a closed gaming group. In order to become a 
member you must first be invited by an existing full member of ClanUk. Once an 
invitation has been received and accepted you are then accepted as a trial member 
of ClanUK for a period of 2 months. During that time, as you game alongside other 
members you get the opportunity to decide if full membership of ClanUK is for 
you. After the two month trial period is over and you still wish to become a member 
of ClanUK, you obtain sponsorship from a full member, a vote is taken and if the 
result is positive you become a full member of the Clan with all 'rights' that 
you are entitled to.</P>

<BR><BR>

<H2>Is That All That’s Involved?</H2>

<P>ClanUK has a set of 'rules' and guidelines that you must subscribe to when 
you register your interest to become a trial member. These rules and guidelines 
are explained in great detail in the Clan Charter but can be summed up as follows:</P>

<I><P>Fair playing, honest, polite Gamers who do not engage in any antisocial behaviour when they represent the Clan online.  We are anti cheat, anti hack and do not tolerate Player killing (pk) as a means of enjoyment or personal gain.</P></I>

<P>To quote from the charter . . .</P>

<I><P>"If you meet a ClanUk player you will know them . . . they are polite, honest, and totally trustworthy".</P></I>

<P>So that’s what we expect from our members.  Nothing more and nothing less.</P>

<BR><BR>

<H2>How Do I Get An Invitation?</H2>

<P>You need to let an existing full member of ClanUK know you are interested in joining the clan.  Once you do this you effectively become what we call a PNM or a Potential New Member.  I say a full member because they are the only ones who are able to invite you.  All full members will generally run a program called CDMS, a clan developed program to, among other things, show which game that member is playing and whether or not they are available to 'trial' you.  Once you locate a full member you simply approach them and ask politely (of course) for a trial game, hunt, frag fest - it all depends on the game you play.  After a few of these (game dependant again) an invitation is sent to the Trial Members list coordinator and one of the ClanUK operators and you are accepted as a trial member. Sorted!</P>

<P>There is a link on the front page of the Clans <A href="http://www.clanuk.com">website</A> 
that tells you the number of people online and there availability.</P>

<BR><BR>

<H2>What If I Can't Find Someone? Or They're All Busy</H2>

<P>Speak / ICQ / Email a ClanUK Operator.   Once you've contacted a Clan Operator to request a trial game, they will either arrange to game with you themselves or contact, on your behalf, a full member who plays the game(s) you are interested in.   The Ops can also provide you with more information about the Clan, or answer questions you might have.  Their information can be found elsewhere on the Clan web site.</P>

<BR><BR>

<H2>In Summary</H2>

<P>You cannot simply join ClanUk you must be invited. To be invited you must spend 
a period of time gaming with existing full members of ClanUk. Once they are satisfied 
you play within the Rules and Ethos of ClanUK, as detailed in the Charter, they 
will 'invite' you into the clan. You are then a trial member for a period of 2 
months. After which you can apply for full membership.</P>
