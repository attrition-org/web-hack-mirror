<H2>Unscheduled Web Move!</H2>
<P>I won't go into the gory political details here, but on Tuesday night we lost 
the ClanUK web services and had to move pretty quickly to establish an alternative. 
As you all now know <A HREF="../index.html">www.clanuk.org</A> is our 
new home, for the time being at least. There are still areas of the site not completely 
functional (Forums) and all .com email addresses have changed. Sorry for not answering 
your queries individually, but as you can imagine I've got my plate full trying 
to pull everything together.</P>
<P>In the meantime, can Baltir and all ZoneMasters/GameAuthors contact me urgently, 
my new email address is <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@clanuk.org">webmaster@clanuk.org</A></P>
<P>Normal service will be resumed as soon as possible &gt;;-)</P>

<H2>The Blue Review </H2>
<P>Wow, a real "weekly update", I must be keen. Actually, it's raining hard outside 
and I'm bored. So don't feel like I care or anything. In fact, I'm pretty annoyed 
because I found a shop around the corner that sells both Reeses pieces and Jolt 
Cola, I went down there today when the sun was shining and it started raining 
on the way. Ah well, I digress. Sit back, take a deep breath, choke on the fumes 
& stagger, teary-eyed through this week's happenings in ClanUK from my biased 
perspective. </P>
<H5>CDMS</H5>
<P> The master of all things Delphi, prince of the illusive and general all-around 
sound bloke known to those not sugar-crazed as Baltir has returned from what can 
only be described as a hectic real life to grace us with the presence of the CDMS 
once more. Opinions have been requested on both the Helpdesk and Clanchat forums, 
if you've got something to suggest get those fingers a-tappin'! It seems like 
there is still loads of enthusiasm for the project both from Baltir himself and 
the members of ClanUK who have been commenting so far. With any luck the CDMS 
will take off this time - finally the ridiculous amount of person power (ooh, 
politically correct ;)) that is being used to keep member administration in check 
will be cut and we can all get back to playing games whilst people sort their 
own stuff out. If you have any questions on the CDMS; what it is, what advantages 
it'll have etc. then there's information on the Helpdesk & ClanChat already, but 
feel free to add your own! questions/idiotic insight ;) </P>
<H5>Asheron's Call Beta </H5>
<P>Mixed reviews about this one on the forums. Is it a better version of EverQuest 
or just beastly product from the realms of evil that are the Microsoft production 
offices. I'd tell you to get out there & test it for yourself (Is it a crap less 
in-depth version of EQ and UO. Does it kick both of them soundly in the nuts? 
Or is it a completely different game?) but apparently Beta finishes this weekend. 
</P>
<H5>Diablo2 </H5>
<P>The Pages In traditional ClanUK style preparation for a yet-to-be-released 
game has started in earnest. Child-prodigy and master of the English language; 
Th|=(aster is following up his successful re-vamp of the Strategy Zone with some 
fancy HTML in the new Diablo2 zone which is well worth a visit. If you intend 
to play Diablo2 (if/when it gets released) within ClanUK you'd better wander along 
to the zone and sign up. It looks like you get to make a profile for yourself 
too, just like the forums - What an opportunity to talk vast amounts of cack about 
yourself, go for it! Oh, there's also a compo, stupid answers to the question 
are called for, go and do me proud! The Forums The fun doesn't stop there though, 
the young scamp has teamed up with our furry webhamster to re-organise the RPG 
forums to allow a seperate area for Diablo2 stuff. This should prove very useful 
for communication once the game is released, so far discussion and trade are the 
Chat options available, I'm sure more will follow after release if they are needed 
;) If you want to join the fun, run along to the RPG chat forum and post your 
Diablo2 related news or questions. If you want to laugh at the over-excited rabble 
run along to the RPG chat forum and read. If you want to laugh at the people laughing 
at.. etc.. well, you're almost as odd as me. Go find a doctor. The Debate Run 
over to the ClanUK Topics for Debate Forum and join the Diablo2 discussions. Remember 
to take along your happy pills and engage brain before responding to comments. 
Preferably your own. (brain, not comments) We can do spam & flame free discussions 
y'know, they smell more pleasant too. </P>
<H5>Action speaks louder than words</H5>
<P> The match between ClanUK and iD should be happening tommorrow as I write this, 
but today as you read it. Sunday at 3pm, as I've said repeatedly, iD are very 
very good. Still, lots of tactical discussions have been going on behind our closed 
doors and our warriors are prepared for battle, so it should be a good match. 
The Action zone is still rocking along quite nicely with high levels of enthusiasm. 
It looks like 3 people were all scrambling to get the news of a new UT version 
release onto the forums. Eager souls, bless 'em. ;) Lots of "keep up the good 
work" messages from me to the guys running the zone and the website bods, the 
UT zone looks wonderful, only wish I thought the same about the game :P. Interested 
in action games? Join the tactical discussions on our private tactics forum or 
go to the main Action Chat board & see if you can set up a game. The ActionUK 
mailing list is also available, just ask one of the main bods, Ypnos, Sephiroth 
& Hoolio, and they're sure to help you out. Afterall, they're just loveable, cuddly 
souls with guns.</P>
<H5> It's not the size of your zone, but what you do with it. </H5>
<P>Following the "Settlers 3 isn't dead!" rant last week the Strategy zone has 
seen more life than usual in the past week, proving that, although strategy isn't 
ClanUK's main department, if you want a game, there will be some poor soul in 
ClanUK ready and willing to show you just how pants you are. Whatever your poison, 
wander off to the Strategy forum and see if you can get a game. If not, convert 
people to your wonderful game. I'm sure they'll love you for making them addicted 
to another game.</P>
<H5> No MMG News </H5>
<P>Come on, you think if I played UO or EQ I could be arsed to write this? It's 
not like you lot have enough time to read and kill pks. Go back to your macroing 
and hate me forever. :P Although, of course, once I have this sodding Uni connect 
working I'll be able to play these things, but I'd like to pass my first year 
thanks. :P Clan Chat Compos Go on you cheapskates, visit ClanChat and see if you 
can win something with competitions that either require no skill or require you 
to be the brain of Britain, or the world or whatever planet some of you are from. 
On those rather rubbish attempts at controversy I shall leave you for another 
week and go drinking.</P>
<P> Comments? Suggestions? Rants? Thought not, still, I welcome mail at<A HREF="mailto:%20friedsmurf@hotmail.com">

<H2>The Blue Review </H2>
<P> <FONT SIZE="-2"><I>(The views within this column are merely those of the author 
and do not necessarily reflect the views of ClanUK as a whole.)</I></FONT> </P>
<P>Welcome to my slightly off-the-wall take on this weeks events within the lovely, 
cuddly & padded walled institution we call ClanUK. So, where to start? The middle 
seems somewhat apt but, for the sake of my sanity, I'll start where I would have 
finished were this not the first of my columns of verbal chunder. For the hard 
of reasoning, we'll call that "The beginning". </P>
<H5>The New Kids on the Block </H5>
<P>Unless you've been under a rock for the past couple of weeks you should be 
aware that the ClanUK Ops elections have taken place. My reference to the band 
that spawned a thousand bands, disbanded & then let loose the ghastly Jordan Knight 
on the world as a solo artist will, hopefully, not be an apt one as time passes. 
Indeed, our six slaves seem to have hit the ground running, a couple looking to 
break the sound barrier, impressive stuff indeed! The times they are a'changin', 
to coin even more abysmal cliches, and our furry ball of fury has already started 
adding to the smooth black hunk that is the ClanUK website, making it smoother, 
slightly redder and vaguely more approchable about emotional problems or teenage 
angst. The Ops are welcoming suggestions (of the concise nonsense-free variety) 
on the forums and via e-mail. So crack those whips & get busy! As for Hammy, well, 
just complain on the forums - he always sorts things out and seems quite used 
to getting hassled fr! om all sides. They say pain lies on the riverside (well, 
Live do) but our furry friend seems to have a level of tolerance to abuse similar 
to the levels shown to alcohol by that fat, bearded "I'd make satan wet himself" 
bloke in your local. Oh, and the former smiles a bit more too. </P>
<H5>No Lights, Thankfully no Camera, Just Action a-plenty </H5>
<P>The ugly beast of progressive thinking that is the Action Zone admin team is 
doing us proud once more. It seems the organisation is becoming lethal once more 
following the rather dramatic exit from a league no-one knew we were in & equally 
dramatic return to the league, supported by frantic ActionUK mailings & fast-paced 
tactical debates on the forums. Looking to capitalise on the increased enthusiasm 
for action games within ClanUK regular practices are being scheduled & no doubt 
the world will fall before us, doubled up in laughter? Maybe, but not according 
to the recent screenshot-frenzy proving our boys have what it takes to, um, kill 
stuff. John Romero himself has been heard to utter "There's room for both games" 
re: The great UT/Q3A debate. But will this be the case? Is there room for both 
in ClanUK? One would like to think so although both games play very differently 
(ok, ok, there are only so many ways to frag a lamer but it's all about weapon 
handling, ask any trained assassin) and seem to be attracting different crowds, 
I'm an unchanging Quake veteran myself, but I seem to be in the minority here 
so no doubt I'll have both games in my collection. Although one cannot deny the 
appeal of playing as ClanUK in Quake Arena and mixing the letters to form QUACK 
as our clan tag. You know you want it. </P>
<H5>Surviving the Wait for D2 </H5>
<P>Having finally got my copy of Baldur's Gate working on my beast of a new PC 
I'm set for a while, but how are people coping with the long wait before the release 
of what could be the biggest anti-climax since sliced bread (which, you must admit, 
was hardly revolutionary)? Of course, D2 could be _the_ game of 2000/2001/2002/whenever, 
just make sure you sign up for the Beta test. Anyway, here's my guide to surviving 
the bitter days/weeks/months: </P>
<P>1. Write a long-winded & dull news column no-one is going to read. Give it 
up after one addition after claiming it's gunna be weekly. <BR>
2. Spend every waking moment checking www.battle.net & www.blizzard.com for new 
information, collect your drool in plastic containers & sell it to insecure people 
as a slimming drink. <BR>
3. Repeatedly e-mail Blizzard complaining, putting more of their staff on PR & 
slowing release down further. <BR>
4. Buy Live "The Distance to Here" and rejoice. <BR>
5. Hang around your local HMV/Electronics Boutique & ask repeatedly about release 
dates for Diablo2.. maybe throw in the occasional Team Fortess 2 comment. Camp 
on their doorstep, don't shave.<BR>
6. Start playing UO or EQ, drop greys in the former & kite in the latter, become 
so absorbed in macroing, cooking 5000 fish & waiting for server updates that when 
Diablo2 comes out you don't notice. <BR>
7. Read all the jokes posted on ClanChat. When you've finished, buy Diablo 2, 
3 & get a copy of Warcraft 3 while you're at it. <BR>
8. Buy system shock 2, neglect sleep for a couple of weeks, lose all track of 
time & become amazed when Diablo2 comes out "just a few days later"<BR>
9. Write a list of things to do while waiting for something, pretend to be original 
and witty by adding "write a list of things to do while waiting for x" as one 
of the listed options, realise it has all been done before & drown in self pity. 
Diablo 2 becomes meaningless. </P>
<H5>Settlers 3 Is not a myth. </H5>
<P>Nor is the strategy zone, no matter how little seems to have gone on within 
its walls in the past. Indeed, a window, or 7, has been opened & light is shining 
into the land of strategy once more. Th|= Caster has taken up Strategy Zonemastery 
and has already started showing off his talents with some mad flash skills. If 
you have the time, visit the Strategy zone & drool. A sign of exciting things 
to come? One hopes so.</P>
<H5> Clan Chat Constantly Criticised. </H5>
<P>It seems no matter what goes on within the bulging bag of fun, known to us 
all as Clan Chat, someone's not going to be happy with it. Flames, Old Jokes, 
insane banter, computer game talk, quizzes, picture-fests, whatever, they're all 
a product of the greatness that is ClanUK. The forums house a bunch of people 
of all shapes and sizes and so produce things of all shapes and sizes (I'm not 
suggesting there is any mating going on). Just take a step back for a second & 
think, "Isn't that cool?" Yes? No? Whatever your view, take care of yourselves, 
and each other. </P>
<P>Your fully higher-order, purely functional +=30ft-Smurf=+ with a nonstrict 
semantics and polymorphic strong typing. Comments? Criticism? Death Threats? <A HREF="mailto:friedsmurf@hotmail.com">friedsmurf@hotmail.com</A>

<H2>Action Zone Restructure</H2>
<P>We've joined a TFC league for which we unfortunately have to miss the first 
match of :o( </P>
<P>The rundown on the league is: </P>
<P>"The Stronghold is a brand new Team Fortress Classic League open to all clans 
who display an attitude of sportsmanship and are prepared to turn up for at least 
one games a week, fielding 5 or more troopers per team. The idea is to provide 
a vessel for the dedicated UK clans to have an arena in which to regularly test 
their skills against like minded individuals. The league is currently full and 
about to begin Season 1."</P>

Aargh- no decision reached<BR>
Kaerwek- Yes </P>
<P>That's about it . Those who didn't have decisions reached was because no one 
new them. </P>
<P> May I just take this opportunity to suggest that we re- think our method of 
voting in full members? Obviously, not many people show up at the meeting. I think 
we should have a secure board for full members only to use - where the trial members 
names would be posted - and the membership could post yes/no/don't know votes 
over a period of time . . .</P>
<P><A HREF="mailto:never.land@virgin.net">Kitten</A> [Emergency Committee Secretary]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Forum Configuration Changes</H2>
<P>Two configuration changes will be carried out the the ClanUK Forums this evening 
(13/09/99). </P>
<P>The first is straighforward: -<BR>
An 'Acceptable Use Policy' has been approved by the Arbiter and the Ops. In using 
the ClanUK Forums, you agree to be bound by this policy. </P>
<P>The second item has also been approved by the Arbiter and the Ops, and is as 
follows: - </P>
<P>A Forum account will be 'required' before any person can post there, although 
non-account holders would still be able to read the public areas. Anyone can apply 
for an account online, by clicking on the 'Edit Profile' option on the menu and 
following the on-screen instructions. Accounts are no longer granted automatically 
in real time, they are queued pending review by a moderator. If the account was 
then granted by a Moderator, a ClanUK member would be given a ClanUK account whilst 
a non-member would be given a non-ClanUK account. Permission on the 'secure' areas 
would remain as they are now.</P>
<P> The advantages to this system are as follows: - <BR>
We would know who everyone is - no anonymous posts, no pseudonyms etc ;<BR>
Should anyone contravene the 'Acceptable Use Policy', their account can be disabled 
immediately. They would be unable to post anything, pending further investigation 
and/or re-instatement of their account </P>
<P><A HREF="mailto:webmaster@clanuk.org">Hammy</A> [Webmaster]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Donations Update</H2>
<P>I know that you've all been dying to know what the figures are - and here they 
are as of Sunday 27 of June.</P>
<P> Number of members who have pledged:67 </P>
<P>Amount pledged:£1615 </P>
<P>Number of members who have donated:36 </P>
<P>Amount donated:£1103.07 </P>
<P>What does this mean? Well- first of all- we can go ahead and buy out Jed. I 
must encourage you, however, to continue to send in your donations because- if 
we get in all of this money that was pledged- we will be able to finance hosting 
the site for an additional year. This will give us plenty of time to find alternative 
funding, or hosting options, or to recover from this bout of donating to do it 
again. Continuing thanks to all who have been supporting this. </P>
<P><A HREF="mailto:never.land@virgin.net">Kitten</A> [Emergency Committee Secretary]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><H2>Complaints Procedure</H2>
<P>A <A HREF="complaints.html">discussion document</A> - for the attention of 
everyone really!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Membership Procedures</H2>
<P>As part of the review of ClanUK membership procedures, Smurf has <A HREF="procedure.html">prepared 
a document</A> for the attention of ZoneMasters and GameAuthors. <B>Please read 
ASAP!!</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H2>Members input wanted</H2>

<P>Ops have already been asked to look at membership procedures, and are looking to consult with members on this. A <A HREF="membuk.html">discussion document</A> is available or get in touch with Ops to let them know your views.</P>

<P>The other biggie Ops are looking into is communication within ClanUK. Again a <A HREF="clancap.html">suggestion document </A> is available or get in touch with Ops to let them hear your ideas on how to improve communication.</P>

<P>Members have already offered some helpful suggestions on these two issues, but Ops are inviting more opinions and welcoming more views so get in touch if you want your opinion to be heard :)</P>
