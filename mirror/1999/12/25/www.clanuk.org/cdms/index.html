<p>CDMS - The future</p>
<p>Okay, this is a fairly lengthy item so please bear with me while I clarify 
  a few points before I really get started *grin*</p>
<p>With the sudden interest in CDMS again becoming THE topic, I've again started 
  receiving Emails asking for accounts. These I won't issue (or give forgotten 
  passwords out to anyone who may have asked for them). There is one simple reason 
  for this, CDMS in its current form is just too rigid and the <i>new</i>v version 
  will require new user accounts and an entirely new database structure to work. 
  So first things first, could everyone please refrain from asking for accounts. 
  They will not be acted upon. Interest is high and I'll try and keep momentum 
  going as much as I can. However, a complete rewrite is required IMO for this 
  application to evolve (again!).</p>
<p>Interest appears to be high again (from the Clan and from a few third parties 
  if the truth be known) so resurrecting CDMS seems like a good idea at the mo. 
  However, this may change. I'm still making no promises as time is simply far 
  far too limited for me presently for me to even provide the roughest of estimates. 
  This is gonna be a Quake III timeline I'm afraid. &quot;It will be finished 
  when its finished&quot;. However, to counter a little of the negative vibes 
  in the above two paragraphs, I'm pretty excited with what could become a pretty 
  useful product.</p>
<p>Okay then, where does CDMS go from here?</p>
<p>For the older members of the clan, CDMS was used quite heavily at the beginning 
  of this year and albeit from a few teething problems, the general concensus 
  from that it performed a useful service. However, general operational issues 
  and issues regarding its use and reason for being were raised by a few members. 
  These issues included: -</p>
<ol>
  <li>No Web Front-End. Why should you have to download a Win32 application to 
    update your database information when a simple set of web forms (implemented 
    either via cgi scripts or ASP) would do the job perfectly well?</li>
  <li>Making changes to the 'games' we played was hard to implement and the games 
    we 'were' playing were changing all the time. This led to the &quot;active 
    game&quot; part of the application becoming a little out of date. Okay, a 
    generic &quot;I am playing&quot; input box got around most of these issues, 
    but with the advent of more online RPG's (all with multiple servers), this 
    needs to be re-thought.</li>
  <li>Sometimes, the executing of the cgi scripts that performed the actual maintenance 
    of the online users were horrifically slow (for no apparent reason). However, 
    as a slight defence to cgi scripts, they are now recognised to be the least 
    preferable way of implementing web applications (with the main reason being 
    speed; every single aysnchronous connection needs to create a new process 
    for it's appropriate cgi script in memory). CGI scripts will always be slower 
    that the internal facilities provided by run-time scripting engines like Active 
    Server Pages (ASP).</li>
  <li>Getting new accounts was practically impossible. This is purely my fault. 
    My spare time literally vanished once I left my permanent job and set up on 
    my own. Emails went unanswered and I apologise for this. I should have had 
    the decency to at least email you all or post a message here informing you 
    all of my current inability to perform any type of 'input' to the Clan. No 
    excuses I'm afraid. It simply shouldn't have happened. It did and I'm sorry.</li>
  <li>There was a distinct lack of adminstration tools available for the day to 
    day management of the CDMS database which resulted in the day to day running 
    of the system falling to me.</li>
  <li>The application needed to be aware of an active Internet connection and 
    start automatically. Users simply kept forgetting to start it. This issue 
    has now been fixed. CDMSConnect now correctly polls for an internet connection, 
    only starting CDMS when a connection is established. Once CDMS is 'running' 
    again, CDMSConnect will be an integral part of the installation of CDMS.</li>
  <li>The Messaging engine needs a lot of work (and to be fair, I'm not surprised. 
    It was a 'quick job' and only took me around 30 minutes to code!).</li>
</ol>
<p>From the above list (and discussions I've had with various people over the 
  last year and a half), the following areas that need to be worked on are as 
  follows: -</p>
<ol>
  <li>The system need to be generic enough to allow for <i>any</i> type of information 
    to be stored against <i>any</i> type of entity. And, this information should 
    be configurable by the administrators of the organisation that is using CDMS. 
    As an example of this, I am currently coding a data mining application for 
    the worlds largest supplier of data mining software. This application is truly 
    generic (the entire repository is created by the DBA's and can contain <i>anything</i>. 
    And is an absolutely nightmare to code against. 'Genericness' adds a lot of 
    time to development :-( ).</li>
  <li>Ditch CGI scripts as the backend and utilise something more efficient to 
    process and return the data to the client (ASP).</li>
  <li>The transfer of data between the Client and Server was not too efficient. 
    A more generic (that word again!) way of transferring data from the client 
    to server (and back again) need to be implemented. XML is really the only 
    way to go with this (IMO).</li>
  <li>A Suite of adminstration tools needs to be written. This will allow operations 
    such as creating the initial 'repository', creating/removing user accounts, 
    obtaining email lists and Member information easily etc.</li>
  <li>Provide a web front-end to the database for organisations that do not require 
    CDMS's Online Status feature (who is online and doing 'what').</li>
  <li>Decide what the hell to do with the messaging system. DO we remove it (and 
    use a more established Net Messenger service instead?) or invest more time 
    in getting this aspect of the application working properly. The jury's still 
    out on this one.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, 6 items need resolving. Unfortunately, as any of the current members who 
  has used CDMS will potentially recognise, the 6 items above basically requires 
  an entire rewrite of the application (with perhaps only the GUI front-ends staying 
  in some sort of recognisable state).</p>
<p>So, is this good news or back news?</p>
<p>Well, it''s a good question. The above is a hell of a lot of work that's for 
  sure. However, you'll notice ClanUK (as an entity) is not mentioned anywhere 
  in the problem domains above. This is intentional as the aim is to create a 
  system architecture that is not set in stone, thus allowing for easier configuration 
  (and erm....easier for me to sell on!). If CDMS is rewritten to be the generic 
  monster as above, the advantages will be enormous. Consider the following: -</p>
<ol>
  <li>Practically no member database maintenance tasks for webmasters of specific 
    GameZone's. Simply access your relevant information from the database.</li>
  <li>The ability to provide instant up to the minute information about your members 
    (okay, we can get this now, but only by going through a lot of people).</li>
  <li>If the decision to store more information about members is approved/required 
    (or another game needs to be shown on the 'games' list), it would be but a 
    small job to start the Administrator application, perform the change and upload 
    it to the database.</li>
</ol>
<p>To summarise then:</p>
<ol>
  <li>CDMS is to be rewritten from scratch to allow for the full configuration 
    of the data it will be required to store.</li>
  <li> All of the back-end scripts are to be rewritten to utilise ASP talking 
    to a more efficent SQL Engine (most probably MS Access initially).</li>
  <li> CDMS Central will stay. However, the communication between the server and 
    client will be rewritten to use XML as opposed to the fudged hybrid markup 
    language I devised myself for CDMS. The key here is 'extensible'. This will 
    utilise the IE 5.0 browser control to perform the parsing of the XML. Therefore 
    IE 5.0 will now be a requirement for CDMS Central. I may well alienate more 
    users by doing it this way, however IE 5.0 is a far more efficent browser 
    than IE 4.0 and performs a service no other Win 32 App yet does well (XML). 
    Plus, I may need these skills for a job I'm quoting for. It's good practice 
    :-)</li>
  <li> A web front-end into the database is to be developed to allow for users 
    who do not wish to use CDMS Central to update their details. Online information 
    however will only be available through CDMS Central. There is a reason for 
    this, the web is stateless and managing the connection information otherwise 
    will be practically impossible.</li>
  <li>The entire application will be able to be manage without my intervention. 
    I really do not have to time to commit to weekly/daily updates of data. Fortunately, 
    Piper has already agreed to perform some issues of the administrative duties 
    involved in managing CDMS.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will be starting the design of the initial architecture probably within the 
  next week or so. Also my companies web page will probably contain a forum purely 
  for CDMS issues (and its development). This should hopefully be going up with 
  the next couple of weeks. However for the time being, I would suggest we concetrate 
  our discussions within the private &quot;ClanUK Topics for Debate&quot; forum.</p>

<H4>10th May 1999</H4>
<p>The main members database has been repaired today after significant corruption 
  (I can only think that this was caused by noise on the line while uploading 
  the file a couple of weeks ago). I will hopefully be updating all members over 
  the next few days so all accounts are active. Remember all, if you <i>could</i> 
  login and now can't, your record has probably been deleted in the repair (sorry) 
  so please email me to get a new account setup.</p>
<p>I am however still encountering performance issues with CDMS that weren't there 
  before. After looking at the tables within the database I may have found a problem 
  and will be looking into it over the next week or so. The internal Access Key 
  table is a little bigger than I'd really like so hopefully this can be fixed 
  by a quick change to the CGI scripts.</p>
<H4>20th April 1999</H4>
<p>21:30 - CDMS is finally up and running again. I had to depend on old DOS ftp 
  to finally get the files uploaded. All other means for some reason failed??? 
  very weird. The database will now be updated shortly so could everyone please 
  refrain from updating their membership details for a little while longer. Apologies 
  again for the downtime recently. </p>
<p>22:50 - Database is now updated with trial members who had requested an account 
  from me. The following members can now login to CDMS. All of your initial passwords 
  are LETMEIN. All ops know the password to the zip file.</p>

<p>Apologies again for the delay in you being added.</p>
<H4>18th April 1999</H4>
<P>After trying all evening to upload the new executables (and failing due to 
  time-outs and the Server closing my connection) I've given up. Will try again 
  hopefully tomorrow evening. </P>
<P>Apologies again.</P>
<H4>17th April 1999</H4>
<P>No it isn't!! No it isn't!!. Due to Interdev insisting 
it updates changed data automatically when I connect, CDMS is now currently down 
until I'm able to recompile the CDMS CGI Executables. This will hopefully be 
done this evening.</P>
<P>My sincere apologies for this.</P>
<H4>7th April 1999</H4>
<P>It's alive!! Its alive!!!! </P>
<P>This page will be updated shortly (to probably use ASP 
to make my life easier) as will be the database so all new members will have 
logons. I again, cannot apologise enough the lack of updates recently but RL has 
just had to come first.</P>
<H4>4th March 1999, 23:50</H4>
<P>Apologies for the lack on contact or CDMS news over the 
last couple of weeks, my new job is not leaving me too much time to do much and 
time in the evening in currently a little short.</P>
<P>I'm also in the unfortunate position of not having my NT 
Server running at home at the moment (which has my database,&nbsp; the database 
drivers and IIS on) so development at the moment is pretty much impossible.</P>
<P>The interim build of CDMS was actually finished last 
week however I simply never had enough time to completely test it and release 
it. Please bear with me, I should be back to normal again soon.</P>
<P>I'm also under the impression some of you are still 
awaiting your logins for CDMS. If&nbsp; you're one on these people, please 
contact me again via email (<A 
href="mailto:baltir@clanuk.com">baltir@clanuk.com</A>) and give me a 'nudge'. However, please be warned, 
without my NT Server being up I can't update your details as the administratrion 
scripts are not yet finished (that allow remote maintenance of the 
database).</P>
<H4>22 February 1999 13:50</H4>
<p>Database update is complete, new members added:</p>
<p>Thrudd (welcome back!!!)<BR>Wolfie<BR>Mauler<BR>SwiftNick</p>
<h4>22 February 1999 13: 45</h4>
<p>Another update to the database is being performed, 
please refrain from updating your details until informed it is safe to do 
so.</p>
<h4>11th February 1999 14:30</h4>
<P>An update to the database has now been finished. Total 
members now within CDMS is 64.</P>
<P>The update to the CDMS Client has been delayed due to 
work pressures, this should be available hopefully by the beginning on next 
week.</P>
<h4>       
             4th February 1999&nbsp; 16:50</h4>
<p>Another update to the database, Flaming June and Ferdy 
are now back with us :-). This takes the number of full members to have 
registered for use of CDMS to 53.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on a new build of CDMS that fixes 
a few known problems (and also some that I've found myself!). This will probably 
be available sometime early next week. Fixes in this version will include:-</p>
<OL>
<li>Fixes the bug that causes an Access Violation when 
    sending a message to yourself . This is caused when the Send Message form is 
    closed before the actual Messages themselves.<BR><BR>The fix is achieved by not allowing you to send a 
    message to yourself (to be honest, I can't actually work out why this is 
    causes the Access Violation it does (it <EM>really</EM> 
  <EM>really </EM>crashes CDMS (and even Delphi in Debug 
    mode, thats why I can't track it down!)). I believe its something to do with 
    the IP Port being open by two processes and them not getting closed down in 
    the right order).<BR><BR>
<li>The 'Snap to Desktop Borders' option on the CDMS 
    Central Window disappears when you toggle the 'Stay on Top' option.<BR><BR>
<li>Sending Mail is now possible without MAPI Services 
    being installed on the PC. This option should now open up your default 
    Internet Email Client.<BR>   </li></OL>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now for something completely different...<BR><BR>I'm not too happy with how the 
chat system works. It's functional but not exactly a great implementation so I'm 
currently looking into rewriting it. For this, I've just started looking into 
utilising DirectPlay (part of DirectX 6.0).</p>
<p>If this is implemented to code a 'chat' engine the 
advantages are going to be pretty big (if I can get the hang of DirectX that 
is).</p>
<p>One facility that would definitely be possible would 
then be a Chat Room type interface (with more than two people simply exchanging 
messages. It would also teach me DirectX (which can't be a bad thing for the old 
CV!).</p>
<p>The disadvantages...well only one I can think of. It 
would not work on Windows NT (which is only at version 3.0 of DirectX). Windows 
2000 will incorporate DirectX 6.1 (or 7.0 if Microsoft don't get their act 
together).</p>
<p>Oh, The 'server' or Chat Room would also have to reside 
on the machine that initiated the chat as we don't have the facility to run 
Server Side applications (apart from CGI Scripts).</p>
<p>Be warned though, this is a LONG term plan (and may not 
even happen) so please don't hold your breath. As I've said, I'm just looking 
into other ideas at the moment.</p>
<p>Any comments regarding this, other suggestions for CDMS 
or bug reports, please post onto the HelpDesk BBS. This way all users should be 
able to keep track of the current state of the application.</p>
<h4>3rd February 1999, 14:00</h4>
<p>The database update is now complete. All mail received 
by me from Clan Ops has now been processed. Keep those requests coming 
people...</p>
<h4>3rd February 1999, 12:15</h4>
<p>The online members count should now be fixed and should 
accurately reflect the number of Clan Members online at that time.</p>
<p>Another manual update to the database will be made 
shortly so please, no remote updates via CDMS until stated.</p>
<h4>2nd February 1999, 16:30</h4>
<p>The online members counter has appeared to have got 
broken and insists on saying six members are online.</p>
<p>Clicking the link though to display currently displayed 
users will display the correct information however. I shall be looking into this 
shortly.</p>
<h4>2nd February 1999, 14:20</h4>
<p>The database has been uploaded with all current details 
I've received. Everyone who has send your details to me is now present (although 
all of your details are blank...please update your membershipdetails 
yourself).Your initial password (who has not been part of the beta-test) is 
&quot;LETMEIN&quot;.</p>
<p>Once logged in, please <strong>CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD!</strong></p>
<h4>2nd February 1999, 13:26</h4>
<p>The Members database is currently being edited locally 
to incorporate all current full member details I've received through a Clan 
Op.</p>
<p><em>DO NOT </em>edit your 
membership details until this page informs you that the database is uploaded 
again.</p>
<h4>1st February 1999</h4>
<p>Version 3.0 of CDMS is now available for download by all 
full members. The database has not yet been cleared down so all non current 
beta-test users will not be able to log in until the cleardown has been 
performed (hopefully this evening or early tomorrow morning).</p>
<p>Download CDMS Version 3.0 <A href="CDMS30.zip" >here</A></p>
<p>This zip file is password protected to enable only Full 
Members to access the software. All Ops and ClanUK Adminstrators know the 
password (which is the same as the previous CDMS zip files).</p>
