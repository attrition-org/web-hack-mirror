<H2><FONT color="#0000ff">Why ClanUK?</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT color="#ffffff">- firstly let us just say that although we are <B>not </B>crusaders  for justice, we do have standards that <B>we </B>adhere to</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- ClanUK stand for a number of issues :</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">1 : We are anti-cheat; this means we do not condone or allow  cheat codes to be used by our members when playing for or within ClanUK</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">2 : We are anti-hack; again we do not condone or use any hack  programs or attempts to break games codes, cheat the game or break the servers, or use  known bug exploitations</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">3 : We are anti PK (Player Killing), no intentional killing of  other players' characters to their detriment and/or your gain</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">4 : We promote a desirable, enjoyable gaming environment for our  members. As such, verbal hostility, slander, and abuse (of any kind) is not tolerated</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">5 : We are proud of ClanUK, and proud of our members. Our image  matters, our reputation is important. So, abuse to gamers outside ClanUK is detrimental to  ClanUK and all our membership, and is not acceptable</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- we are pro UK; this is because the majority of our members are  from the UK, nothing more. We therefore play with gamers from the same time zone (so can  meet more readily), and the same geographical area (so internet connection/modem play is  more ideal)</FONT></P>  <H2><B><FONT color="#0000ff">ClanUK Membership</FONT></B></H2>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- this is by invitation only</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- a player outside ClanUK may approach a member and request to be  in ClanUK. The member has 2 choices : </FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">1: The member can say no, they do not wish to invite them in, and  refer them to the Membership/Deputy Web Site member. They will be expected to be polite  and offer a sensible reason to the player for this refusal of invitation. The player can  then consider this, and can approach ClanUK at a later time if they wish. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">2: If they wish, the member can help the new player. This will  mean 3 things :</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">a : Playing with them, so the member sees what the player is like  in the game</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">b : Sending them this <B>Charter</B></FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">c : Introducing them to other members in ClanUK including 1 Full  Member</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the new player is not yet in ClanUK, and is not yet a new Trial  Member</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- after gaming alongside a new player for a while, and feeling  they are the sort of gamer ClanUK delights in, and allowing them to see what ClanUK  players are like, they can become Trial Members. This is where they are, at the invitation  of a Full Member, joining ClanUK. They become Trial Members for a minimum of 2 months.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- membership is dynamic. New members will join ClanUK, old  members will leave it. So, inactive members will be removed from the membership list, so  membership remains a true representation of the players we have within ClanUK</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- ClanUK members can invite suitable players in to ClanUK, gamers  not need always approach ClanUK first</FONT></P>  <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P><H2>  <B><FONT color="#0000ff">Conditions of ClanUK Membership</FONT></B></H2>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- as a ClanUK member you will not use cheats, hacks or bug  exploitations when playing as a ClanUK character</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- you will not be abusive to other gamers or cause harassment by  actions, or be </FONT>racist</P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- you will abide by the decisions of the ClanUK Operators (Ops),  ClanUK Arbiter and ClanUK Council</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- you will not falsely represent ClanUK in any manner</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- you will not bring ClanUK into disrepute by your actions, on or  offline</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- members will not lie, deceive or mislead members, especially  Ops or the Arbiter</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- as a new member you will undergo a 2 month trial period</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- completion of this trial period does not mean automatic Full  Membership into ClanUK</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- all Full and Trial Members are <B>required </B>to report any  Full or Trial Members breaching these rules to the ClanUK Arbiter</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- as a Full Member you have the right to vote/submit opinions on  any issue that affects ClanUK as a whole, and access to the ClanUK Locator/CDMS, when  developed</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- as a Full and Trial Member you have the right to express  yourself through the Ops and through communications on the chat boards (BBS), or  submitting to Ops with a view to being posted on the main web site front page as News</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- all Full Members have the right to stand for Ops positions</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- Ops positions will be voted for on a 4 monthly basis</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- Jed Norton (ClanUK Web Master) and Baltir (ClanUK  Membership/Deputy Web Master) may not stand for Ops positions</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- usage of the ClanUK&#153; title or logo is expressly forbidden  without prior written consent from ClanUK and CTC Ltd</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- ClanUK Ops will be removed if they are seen to act in any  manner that shows overt favouritism towards any, after investigation by the Arbiter</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- Trial and Full Members will be removed if they can not adhere  to these conditions</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- ClanUK is free, there are no financial costs for membership</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- ClanUK must not be used as a means to promote outside personal  interests, e.g. personal businesses or marketing. ClanUK merchandise is available through  the web site, this service is provided for those who wish to have items with the ClanUK  logo</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- issues not concerning ClanUK, which could be damaging to  ClanUK, must be discussed with an Op before being posted on the ClanUK web site, to ensure  they are appropriate (e.g. it is not appropriate for a member to have a link to a web  address of a cheat/hack site)</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- conditions may change as ClanUK evolves, such changes will be  detailed for all members</FONT></P>  <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P><H2>  <B><FONT color="#0000ff">ClanUK Structure</FONT></B></H2>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- this is in the form of ClanUK Council, Arbiter, Operators  (Ops), Full Members, Trial Members, Zone Masters, Web Master, Membership/Deputy Web Master</FONT></P>  <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P><H2>  <B><FONT color="#0000ff">ClanUK Council</FONT></B></H2>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- this consists of most of the founder members (and is an  unchanging group) who almost never have anything overt to do. They are there as a safety  measure. Should the active leaders (essentially the Ops) be straying from the ideals of  ClanUK then they step in to veto the changes and ensure the direction and aim of ClanUK  does not get diverted away from its original intentions</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they have input at meetings as any ordinary members can, but  that's normally the end of their remit</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they <B>only</B> get together to discuss <B>major</B> changes  in clan rules or events. Unless they are also an Op or Arbiter they do not have any direct  input into ClanUK decisions on a day-to-day basis.</FONT></P>  <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P><H2>  <B><FONT color="#0000ff">ClanUK Arbiter</FONT></B></H2>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- this is a judge and mediator</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Arbiter has a duty to be fair to ClanUK as well as  individuals</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Arbiter mediates disputes, ensures conduct/standards are  maintained, and ensures the active player base is maintained (i.e. the inactive players  are removed). Inactive will be people who have no significant web presence or  participation. Infrequent players who still post on the BBS, or turn up to meetings, and  play occasionally, will still of course be welcome to game with us. Quantity of time on  line is not so vital as quality of participation in ClanUK. To help Ops remain  approachable, discipline will be undertaken by the Arbiter - the Ops raise concerns, but  the Arbiter deals with them</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Arbiter has the authority to regrade a Full Member to a  Trial Member</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Arbiter has the authority to remove a member from ClanUK</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Arbiter will be one person. This will ensure that there is  consistency, and all matters will be dealt with in the same manner, to ensure fairness</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the post will, like Council, Web Master, Deputy Web Master, be  enduring. The person in this post will change should circumstances require this. Then, the  person will be decided by ClanUK Council consensus, after discussion with the Ops (to gain  the memberships' view)</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Ops, Trial and Full Members have a duty to ClanUK as a  whole, and so <B>must</B> report incidents to the Arbiter where members are inappropriate </FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Arbiter mainly takes instructions from the Ops, to look in  to episodes, to help resolves issues and de-escalate them before they get out of hand</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Arbiter can be called upon by Ops to justify decisions, and  is accountable to ClanUK Council</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- if the Arbiter is behaving irresponsibly then the Ops <B>must </B>draw  this to the Arbiter's attention, and detail why. If things do not improve, the Ops can  request that the Arbiter resigns as Arbiter. If this fails to happen, then ClanUK Council  will be <B>required</B> to look at the situation and decide if the Arbiter stays as  Arbiter (if decisions have been appropriate) or is removed from ClanUK (if they have been  grossly inappropriate)</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Arbiter is therefore an Op, with the power to enforce  ClanUK rules. In Op meetings, the Arbiter will be able to vote only in the case of a tie,  and then the vote must be based on what is best for ClanUK, thinking of the Councils'  ethos, and not his own opinion</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- if players feel that an Op has treated them unfairly, they can  ask the Arbiter for advice and help about this</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- progression from Trial Member to Full Member will involve a  meeting with the Arbiter</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Arbiter is currently Sheleph</FONT></P>  <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P><H2>  <B><FONT color="#0000ff">ClanUK Operators (Ops)</FONT></B></H2>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- these are elected for every 4 months by all Full Members voting</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they act in 5 main capacities :</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">1 : To enforce rules/crush cheating through guidance, and  bringing to the Arbiter's attention any such issues</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">2 : Help players with problems in ClanUK and in games</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">3 : Foster the ideals/encourage game play consistent with the  ideals of ClanUK </FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">4 : Voicing members views at meetings so members who can not  attend still can contribute to ClanUK</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">5 : Set behavioural standards by example (e.g. language,  courtesy)</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they are expected to look after ClanUK, so if they have  concerns about a player they have a duty to raise their concerns with the Arbiter, they do  not need to redress the problem themselves - by confronting members they could prejudice  future relations with members and loose their <B>approachability</B>, which is of critical  importance</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they will be visible via the web site (with ICQ and e-mail  addresses posted) so they are evident and accessible and approachable by members</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they have to organise monthly meetings, where members can  attend (or have expressed their views prior to a meeting to an Op, for refining), meeting  either on ICQ or IRC (or another universal forum, it shall not be a single in-game  meeting, such as on battle.net)</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they are to circulate an agenda for this meeting before the  meeting</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they are to send News to the Web Master to post the outcomes of  each meeting, for Members who could not attend, and for visitors of the web site to see  how ClanUK is functioning</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- their <B>key</B> role is communication. They communicate to  Zone and Web Masters what the membership is wanting, what the membership likes and  appreciates, and how this can be realised through the web page</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they also communicate ClanUK future intentions to the members,  mainly through these meetings</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they are to regularly post News to the Web Master, so ideally  News can be updated every day</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they tell the Web Master what the membership thinks about the  web site (regular feedback)</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- after meetings, Ops will meet themselves to discuss what  changes need to be made to policy/guidelines, web sites, or game play and debate issues  members have raised</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- there will usually be 6 Ops, and the Arbiter, to help the  members of ClanUK</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the number of Ops may need to be increased over time, however  experience has shown that greater numbers has resulted in unwieldy meetings, and so  ineffective Ops</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- Ops will attend meetings to consider Trial Membership  progressing to Full Membership, they will post on the BBS which Trial Members are being  considered for Full Membership, and when the meeting will be. They will listen to the  views of Members about the Trial Member, and represent these views at the meeting. They  will ensure that the details of this meeting are conveyed through the web page, either as  News or on the BBS</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- Ops receive information from members in confidence, and will  not detail member names along with the suggestions/comments unless the member agrees or so  wishes. If the Op feels they need to, or it would be helpful to, pass along the member's  name, then they must tell the member this. Member names, e.g. in accusations, will not be  public. Only the Arbiter and maybe other Ops need know the name of the member kindly  voicing concern</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- Ops are not linked to one game. They may play more in one game  than any other, thus allowing members in that game to know them well, and have frequent  access to them, or they may play in lots of games, spanning a broad membership base</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- Full Members vote for Ops, as such they can vote for Ops that  will play in their games, or be available to them to represent their views, and relay  their concerns, pleasures and expectations</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they must pass apologies of absence at meetings, from members,  to the Membership/Deputy Web Master</FONT></P>  <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P><H2>  <B><FONT color="#0000ff">Full and Trial Members</FONT></B></H2>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they must read and agree to the Conditions of ClanUK  Membership, above</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- members may resign at any time. It would be courteous, on doing  so, to inform the Membership/Deputy Web Master of this</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- if members are away for a significant length of time, it would  be courteous to let the Membership/Deputy Web Master know too, so other members aren't  thinking there's rudeness in not replying, attending meeting, or responding to posts on  the BBS.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">Clearly it can not be expected for members to detail every time  they are away for a significant length of time, but by doing so it will enhance  communication and prevent misinformation/confusion about not replying/engaging with ClanUK</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the membership are expected to voice their opinions at meetings  and on the BBS</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- general concerns can be raised informally between members, or  through Ops</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- if there are concerns about a specific issue, an Op should be  called</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- concerns about a specific player <B>must </B>be referred by  members to the Arbiter, members have this duty to ClanUK. They must not post  negative/derogatory comments on the BBS about other players</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they are expected to behave with courtesy to members, and to  outside players. Banter, humour and colourful language in private ClanUK games is fine (if  no-one's offended), but offensive language in public chat channels is not . . . basically  it's common sense, to protect the good reputation of ClanUK</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- members have plenty of good ideas and positive statements about  ClanUK, these should be detailed to Ops, so their input is channelled through, at meetings</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- it is encouraged for members to relay to Ops things they think  are happening well (so these are built upon, and continued), and things that they think  could be better done differently (along with any sensible suggestions they may have)</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- it is important that even if members have no strong feelings,  and are content with the way things are, that they still episodically mention to an Op  that they are happy with things, this feedback really does matter</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- if members do not wish to attend a monthly meeting they are  expected to e-mail an Op and let them know, effectively sending their apologies for being  unable to attend. This is so ClanUK Ops are aware that the member is active in ClanUK but  unable to attend, or has already expressed their views to the Ops</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- Trial Members will become Full Members after 3 conditions have  been met :</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">1: They still want to be full members, and have been active  members of ClanUK</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">2 : A Full Member sponsors them after 2 months minimum Trial  Membership</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">3 : At a meeting with Ops, Arbiter and relevant Zone Master  informal discussion occurs, considering views of the membership through the last 2 months.  Hopefully this will all be positive, with views of members expressing pleasure at gaming  with the Trial Member, and they can then be Full Members. This meeting will be private, so  members views can be voiced through Ops. The Trial Member can choose to be there, or not.  Full Membership meetings will be posted before they occur on the BBS so members can say to  Ops their views of the Trial Member. It is for the sponsor of the Trial Member to request  the meeting to take place.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- Sponsoring a Trial Member is a public acknowledgement by the  Full Member that they believe the Trial Member to be the sort of player they want to have  as a Full Member in ClanUK, so they must know the Trial Member well . . . they should have  played in games with them (so know their game play is social, not cheating/exploitation,  the style is not selfish/against ClanUK ideals) and out of game/in chats/seen posts on BBS  (so they know something of their views, enthusiasm and attitudes). This public statement  by the Full Member of the Trial Member's gaming and ClanUK activity will be recorded by  the Membership/Deputy Web Master. If the Trial Member, then becoming a Full Member, is  removed from ClanUK, the original sponsoring member will need to justify their  sponsorship. This is to ensure that sponsorship is taken seriously, and only well known  Trial Members shall be sponsored.</FONT></P>  <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P><H2>  <B><FONT color="#0000ff">Web Master</FONT></B></H2>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Web Master maintains the web site, and updates the web  zones</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Web Master may episodically overhaul the site to maintain  an image of ClanUK we want to publicly project</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- this will occur after discussion at meetings with Ops, so  ClanUK members have input</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Web Master is currently expected, through the links forged  on the 'net, to link in to professional bodies (e.g. software companies, computer gaming  magazines, other online gaming groups) who are interested in ClanUK. It is desirable for  dialogue between ClanUK and outside bodies to be fed back to ClanUK membership at  meetings, so the Web Master will inform the Ops of all such contact, and the outcome, so  the ClanUK membership can be aware of this important communication</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- if this becomes onerous, then this part of the Web Master's  role can be assigned to a new post, <B>ClanUK Representative </B>- a person skilled in  interpersonal and media relations to represent ClanUK publicly, to professional groups, <B>and  </B>to feed back to ClanUK the outcome of this contact. Ops would decided on who would  have this post, based on member views and the applicants skills</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- if the Ops fail to send the Web Master any News, the Web Master  will e-mail them informing them of this, and may either leave the News un-updated, or post  News the Web Master is aware of himself, at his own discretion</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Web Master can vote as a Full Member but has no other  powers, duties or responsibilities (and as such should not be besieged by e-mails or  requests from general Members, who should voice their opinions through Ops and Zone  Masters)</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Web Master should receive constructive e-mails from Ops  (representing members comments and views), about what's good about the web site, and what  could be changed, with positive suggestions about this</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the Web Master shall maintain the chat boards (BBS)</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- Jed Norton is currently Web Master</FONT></P>  <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P><H2>  <B><FONT color="#0000ff">Membership/Deputy Web Master</FONT></B></H2>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- this person will assist the Web Master in the running of the  web site</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they will be a visible point of contact, on the web site, for  new members (and will send prospective new members this <B>Charter</B>) and answer  questions potential members may have</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they will keep a record of all Trial, Full and past Members</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they will keep a record of all sponsors, and who they sponsored</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they will keep a record of all members apologies for absence  from monthly meetings (which the Ops will send to him)</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- the current Membership/Deputy Web Master is Baltir</FONT></P>  <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P><H2>  <B><FONT color="#0000ff">Zone Masters</FONT></B></H2>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- they look after the web page of that game or support zone. They  are obliged (i.e. have to) update it regularly. If not, then they should step down and  allow a more active/less busy member to continue the zone. These posts will be allocated  to who want to do them, and can commit sufficient time and skills to review and update  roughly weekly. This may mean just a fresh paragraph of news every week, so hopefully not  a vast amount is required</FONT></P>  <P><FONT color="#ffffff">- new Zone Masters may start new Game Zones, if you want to start  a games zone of your own for a particular game this is what you must do : </FONT></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>    <BLOCKQUOTE>      <P><FONT color="#ffffff">1 : Create a &quot;Sampler&quot; site of no more than 1.5MB.      Feedback from this will judge </FONT></P>    </BLOCKQUOTE>    <P><FONT color="#ffffff">whether or not there is enough interest for it to become a Game    Zone </FONT></P>    <BLOCKQUOTE>      <P><FONT color="#ffffff">This sampler must be sent to the ClanUK Webmaster to post up, you      will <B>not</B> have</FONT></P>      <P><FONT color="#ffffff">site access at this point</FONT></P>      <P><FONT color="#ffffff">2 : If there is adequate feedback from the sampler it will be      raised to a full </FONT></P>      <P><FONT color="#ffffff">Game Zone</FONT></P>      <P><FONT color="#ffffff">3 : At this point an &quot;Author&quot; account will be provided      for you as well as a larger </FONT></P>      <P><FONT color="#ffffff">space of between 2-5 MB maximum.

We do not crusade for  others to play as we do, but will expel members who break our rules.

It has happened because our members have supported the  web site and been true to their ideals and their net-friends.
