<p align="left">1.&nbsp; <a href="../join/index.html">First
go here!</a><br>
<br>
- A Full Member asks someone if they would like to join ClanUK. (or they ask A Full Member
and A Full Member thinks about inviting them)<br>
<br>
- A Full Member&nbsp; has gamed with them and know they are honorable and adhere
to the <a href="../charter/index.html">Charter</a><br>
<br>
- A Full Member introduces them to another full member, and the other full
member evaluates them also<br>
<br>
- A Full Member sends in ALL of their information, i.e. email address, icq
number, full name, game name, games they play etc.. to <a href="mailto:brutus@bruts.freeserve.co.uk">BRUTUS</a>
the trial membership person. A Full Member has just made this person a trial
member, effective now.<br>
<br>
- The PNM is now a <a href="../trial/trialmembers.html">trial
member</a> of ClanUK<br>
<br>
(extra advice)<br>
- The Trial Member coordinator should send these details to the GM or Head
Person in charge of that game. (So all the people know what is going on and can
arrange for the below)<br>
<br>
-----------------------------<br>
<br>
Now to join the relative Clan Team in whatever zone the PNM wishes to play, the
PNM and Full member approach the GM or Head Honcho to get on the guild stone,
get the password to the server, or whatever.<br>
<br>
The GM or Head Honcho may have additional requirements/rules to understand to
play this game with the fellow Clan mates. Example, sharing the loot, don't
shoot me, team rules.<br>
<br>
