<H4>ZoneMasters</H4>
<P>There are four ZoneMasters, one for each Zone. A ZoneMaster need not necessarily 
be technical, nor write a single line of code (although a ZoneMaster may <I>also</I> 
be a GameAuthor). They are essentially 'managers' for that particular Zone and 
the GameAuthors will report Directly to them. The ZoneMaster's duty is to ensure 
that the webs contained within their Zone reflect the needs of the Clan and it's 
visitors. The ZoneMasters are responsible to <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@clanuk.org">the 
Webmaster</A>.</P>
<P ALIGN="center">&nbsp;</P>
<H4>GameAuthors</H4>
<P>Typically a GameAuthor will design and publish a web site on a particular game 
that ClanUK has interests in. This web site should reflect the needs of the Clan 
and it's visitors. There can be any number of GameAuthors within a GameZone. The 
GamesAuthors are responsible to their ZoneMaster although they may, if required, 
seek technical advice from <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@clanuk.org">the Webmaster</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Technical Structure</H4>
<P>There is a master 'root' directory for each GameZone and each of these 'roots' 
have a unique log-in account. Any number of webs can be contained with this root. 
For example, the RPG zone has a root directory called 'rpg', within this are three 
sub-directories - 'diablo', 'diabloII' and 'bg'. Therefore all the Diablo files 
should be stored within the 'diablo' subdirectory, the DiabloII files within 'diabloII' 
and Baldur's Gate files within 'bg'. As a number of GameAuthors will be sharing 
one log-in account they should take the utmost care NOT TO OVERWRITE EACH OTHERS 
WEBS! Each web will be linked to, by <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@clanuk.org">the 
Webmaster</A>, from the core site.</P>
