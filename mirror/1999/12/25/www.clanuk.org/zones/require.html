  <P>There aren't too many requirements for GameZones, we are firm believers in 
    the richness and diversity that comes with a multi-author environment. In 
    other words, variety is the spice of life!</P>

<LI>Your start page must be entitled index.html or index.htm<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>This start page must include the standard ClanUK logo which must also be a 
link to the ClanUK home page<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>The start page must also include 'meta-tags'. These invisible tags assist 
search engines in listing your site and they will be provided by the Webmaster<BR>
<BR>
There are reasons for the above requirements. As well as publicizing the ClanUK 
web site 'as a whole', we will be promoting the GameZones as web sites in their 
own rite. It's worth remembering then, that visitors may come to your sites without 
first having visited the ClanUK core site. Your start page should be fast to load 
and informative about the subject covered.<BR>
