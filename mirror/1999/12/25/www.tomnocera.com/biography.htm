        <p style="text-indent: .5in" align="justify">I was born in South Bend,
        Indiana on September 26, 1948 and named after Republican Thomas E. Dewey,
        who was supposed to have been elected President - according to my very
        Republican parents.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: .5in" align="justify">When I'm asked about my
        early background, I respond that who I am today is a direct result of the quality
        of coaching I've had during the course of my life.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: .5in" align="justify">The best coach anybody
        could've asked for was my Dad. Fact is, his life's avocation was
        coaching and his first job out of college was coaching high school athletic
        teams and teaching health. In addition to coaching Bud, my younger brother,
        and myself, Dad was also proud of having been Chuck Tanner's coach. (Mr.
        Tanner is well known for successfully managing the Pittsburgh Pirates for
        many years and being a great coach.)</p>
        <p style="text-indent: .5in" align="justify">Dad encouraged me to take
        some measured risks, but not to take foolish chances. He motivated me to
        do well in school and join the Boy Scouts which, in turn, provided my
        first leadership opportunities. I rose quickly through the ranks to the
        rank of '<i>Life Scout</i>'. My Dad also motivated me to get my first
        job at age 14, bagging groceries after school in Mishawaka, Indiana.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: .5in" align="justify">1965 was an important year
        for our family. That was the year we permanently relocated to Largo,
        Florida. I continued working while attending <i>Largo High School</i> <font size="2"><i>(Class
        of '66)</i></font> and thereafter while enrolled at the newly opened
        Clearwater Campus of <i>St. Petersburg Junior College</i>.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: .5in" align="justify">Following my graduation
        from <i>St. Petersburg Junior College <font size="2">(Class of '69)</font></i>, having earned my commercial
        pilot's license and while waiting for the word of acceptance from <i>Metropolitan
        State College</i> in Denver (where I worked my way through B.S. degree
        in Aerospace Management), it was my Dad who helped me hire on with his
        company (the Launch Support Division of the <b>Bendix Corporation</b> at
        Kennedy Space Center) during the summer of 1969.&nbsp;
        <p style="text-indent: .5in" align="justify"> Working as an associate
        engineer with the Launch Pad Engineering Group, I was one of the
        youngest and proudest on the team that launched <b>Apollo X</b> and the
        historic <b>Apollo XI</b> man's first footsteps on the moon. My
        recollection of that historical day is burned deeply into my memory. For
        I stood with then Senator Barry Goldwater, his son Barry Goldwater, Jr. and
        astronaut Eugene Cernan at the forward perimeter fence. The four of us
        having walked together the quarter mile from the VIP viewing area to better capture the
        moment on film.
        <p style="text-indent: .5in" align="justify"> Following graduation from <i>Metropolitan
        State College</i> in 1971, for ten weeks, my brother and I toured
        Europe. While enjoying this cultural adventure, I came to realize how
        fortunate we are to live in America. And how easy it is for us to take
        the&nbsp; liberties our ancestors fought so hard to obtain, for granted.
        Upon my return to the States, I re-established my residency in Pinellas
        County, Florida and first became active in the Republican Party.</td>
