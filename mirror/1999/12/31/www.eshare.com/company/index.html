<p>
<img src="../images/companyb.jpg" width=188 height=103 alt="" border="0" align="right" hspace="5">eShare Technologies has achieved industry-wide recognition as the pre-eminent expert in human interaction on the Internet, supplying software and services to commerce and community sites worldwide. We help businesses and institutions improve the effectiveness of their internet, intranet, and extranet sites by adding the power of people. Whether you're building community, conducting e-commerce, or simply communicating, adding the human touch can help you achieve your objectives. Giving your site visitors the option of communicating with other visitors or with a representative of your firm can improve satisfaction, increase revenues, reduce costs, increase traffic, retention, and return visits.
<p>
<b>Our Roots</b><br>
Founded in November 1996, eShare Technologies evolved from Interactive Marketing Technologies, a pioneer in online services since 1988, well before the mass adoption of the Internet. eShare introduced its first product line, eShare Expressions&reg; in the Spring of 1997, taking the market by storm. Due to its enthusiastic market reception, eShare Expressions soon outpaced the previous leader in the chat space. With the recent market withdrawal of its leading competitor, Expressions now enjoys unrivaled leadership in the community chat and collaboration application arena. In 1998, eShare introduced eShare NetAgent&#153 &#151; its market leading customer interaction solution. 
<p>
eShare, headquartered in Commack, Long Island, New York, has grown in only two years to over 60 employees and has acquired the confidence of over 1500 customers, adding more than 100 new customers each month. 
<p>
<b>Our Vision</b><br>
Our vision, simply stated, is that all commerce and community web sites will provide human interaction to their users, allowing people around the globe to experience in a virtual world the same satisfaction they enjoy in their real environments - the satisfying experience of people communicating and interacting with one another. Our philosophy is that, as social creatures, humans need the experience of interacting with one another in all environments - real and virtual. eShare brings the experience of people interacting with people to the Internet - adding the power of people to every web site across the globe! 
<p>
<b>1998 - a Defining Year for eShare</b><br>
1998 was a defining year for eShare, the year in which eShare proved itself as an Internet software and services leader. In 1998 eShare grew its revenues almost six-fold over 1997. It achieved the undisputed number one position in the chat market, forcing the withdrawal of its rival and previous market leader, iChat. Today eShare Expressions enjoys market acceptance greater than all other chat software providers combined. 
<p>
In 1998 eShare also introduced its customer interaction software solution, eShare NetAgent&#153;, entering the exploding e-commerce market and establishing an early lead in the new and exciting field of Internet-based customer interaction, part of the highly visible customer relationship management application market. 
<p>
In 1998 eShare added over 800 customers to its impressive roster of over 1500 satisfied, long-term, loyal companies and institutions. 
<p>
eShare also expanded its management team and attracted key employees, positioning itself for further growth and market acceptance in 1999 and beyond. 
<p>
Culminating an outstanding year of achievement, eShare, for the second year in a row, received recognition as one of the Silicon Alley 100 top technology companies. In fact, the Silicon Alley association formally extended its geographic charter to include Long Island as a result of eShare's success. 
<p>
<b>eShare Customers - the Internet Leaders</b><br>
eShare has won the confidence of over 1500 customers, including the leaders in innovation on the Internet. eShare's products are affordable for small web sites and demonstrate the proven reliability and scalability required for the largest Internet portals and commerce sites. 
<p>
eShare Expressions delivers chat rooms to Lycos' 2.5 million members, supporting over 2500 simultaneous chat users and 75,000 logins per day. Expressions supports equally impressive communities on other leading portal sites as well, including GeoCities, StarMedia, Cendant, Tripod, and AT&amp;T WorldNet. 
<p>
eShare NetAgent continues to build momentum, garnering enthusiastic market acceptance from the likes of 1800Flowers, AT&amp;T WorldNet, Computer Discount Warehouse, Automatic Data Processing, and America Online to augment their Internet customer service and support capabilities.
