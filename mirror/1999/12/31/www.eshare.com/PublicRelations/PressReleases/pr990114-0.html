<i>Continuing to Grow as the Market Leader, eShare Announces New Executive Team</i>
<p>
Commack, NY &#151; Jan. 14,1999 &#151; eShare Technologies, a leading provider of Internet-based human interaction software, today announced several strategic executive appointments designed to further strengthen the company's leading market position.  James Tito co-founder, CEO and former president will expand his executive role as CEO and has been promoted to chairman.  To support Tito's focus on eShare's overall strategic and financial goals, Doris Granatowski, former COO/CFO, has been promoted to president.   eShare has also appointed Glenn Reyer as vice president of marketing and Scott Manning vice president of sales.   Neil Toomb, who joined the company in June, has been promoted to executive vice president of sales and business development.
<p>
Steve Robbins, analyst with Yankee Group, estimates that all Web-based interaction will be a growing market through the year 2001, growing from about $35M in 1998 to almost $600 million.  These appointments further strengthen eShare's commitment to the Internet-based human interaction market and demonstrate the company's dedication to this growing market segment.
<p>
"As chairman of eShare Technologies, I will continue to lead the organization in developing strategic  and financial goals for the coming year," said James Tito, co-founder and chairman of eShare Technologies.  "The additional executive appointments complete our strong management team and enable an integrated business approach from strategy to marketing and sales that will help drive eShare to the next millennium."

Tito has extensive experience in the development and expansion of fast-growing companies.  Since co-founding the company, Tito's vision has propelled the company into the number one leadership position in the marketplace.

Reyer brings more than 25 years of computer software industry experience to eShare, as both a strategic marketer and software engineer.  He joined eShare from EC Cubed, an e-commerce software provider.
