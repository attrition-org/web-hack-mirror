<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000">Fatal Error has occured
in time.h, 00-01-00(not responding)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000">At St. Louis Internet we
take security <b>very</b> seriously. Our systems, and those of
our dedicated connection customers, are protected using the
latest technology in firewall protection. We offer both managed
and on-site firewall systems which immediately stop unwanted
activity before it reaches our client machines and alert our
security staff for appropriate action. We are proud to say that
since 1994 none of our equipment has ever been compromised.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000FF">Heh, looks like you
should take security even a little more seriously, and secondly,
your firewall sucks my right nut, I am its daddy, I hope you didn't
actually PAY for that thing. Haven't been compromised since '94?
heh , if you ONLY had a clue!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000FF">Hackers wanna try,
Hackers wanna lie<br>
Then Hackers wonder why, Hackers wanna die<br>
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain<br>
I cannot maintain with that shit on my brain<br>
I resort to violence, my hackers move in silence<br>
Like you don&#146;t know what our style is<br>
Uneek hackers the wildest<br>
My hackers is wit&#146; it<br>
You want it, come and get it<br>
Took it then we split it<br>
You fuckin&#146; right we did it<br>
What the fuck you gonna do when we run up on you<br>
Fuckin&#146; with the wrong crew, don&#146;t know what we goin&#146;
through </font></p>

color="#0000FF">This is something that I belive everyone that has
been defacing lately needs to read</font></a></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000FF">Don't you just hate it
when shit like this happens?<br>
Patch shit when security advisories are released and this shit
will not happen.<br>
Maybe you should look into getting an admin that isn't a complete
retard</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000FF">And NO kids, this was NOT
done using that damn Msadc.pl script, There is more than one way
to rape a NT box</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000FF">Admin: When your done
crying, e-mail us to find out how to patch your box and prevent
this from happening again.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000FF">Yes, I am a criminal. My
crime is that of curiosity.<br>
My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think,<br>
not what they look like.<br>
My crime is that of outsmarting you,<br>
something that you will never forgive me for.<br>
I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.<br>
You may stop this individual,<br>
but you can't stop us all... after all,<br>
we're all alike.<br>
