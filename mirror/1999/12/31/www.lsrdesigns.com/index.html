Somewhere in the digital mesh we know as the internet 2 wise hackers
discuss existence....and so it begins...
<p>

...y2k...how much damage do you really think there will be?
<p>
@nothing critial
<p>
should I stockpile food, water and ammo?
<p>
@humans are stupid, but as a colletive, we arent that dumb.
<p>
good saying, I like that
<p>
@heh
<p>
...your words will replace my Jesus qutoe!
<p>
@hahahaha
<p>
@awesome
<p>
:)
<p>
@my all time favorite quote that i came up with a friend was, "you are a
<p>
@figment of my imagination, if i stop thinking of you you cease to
exist"
<p>
LOL...I like that one too
<p>
@i know.
<p>
@:)
<p>
@think about it tho. how can you proove that wrong.
<p>
@if you stop thinking about me, you dont know if i exist or not.
<p>
@so i am prolly not there any more.
<p>
@but the instant you believe i am there, i am.
<p>
impossible....except that I doubt if one mind could have created all of
<p>
this.....except God's
<p>
works like mass illusions
<p>
@so there are only about a third of the humans on this planet that are
<p>
@real, the rest are a complex dream like creation soo complex that we
can
<p>
@distinguish it from reality.
<p>
@god is none existant
<p>
@in the sens of existent.
<p>
JS....the Matrix has you!
<p>
@i am the matrix
<p>
LOL
<p>
@you are my imagination.
<p>
@you exist only because i allow you to exist.
<p>
@fear is the need to survive.
<p>
you're imagination, my friend, is quite vivid!
<p>
@death is the beginning of life.
<p>
@life........is god.
<p>
@god is not.
<p>
@life is not.
<p>
reality is an everflowing mass halucination
<p>
@what you think of life, is a supremely complex mental illusion.
<p>
@contained in the collective minds of a few billion people.
<p>
@wake up, or die in this hallucination, and your life begins.
<p>
ÄÄÄponders
<p>
damn, you got ME at a loss for words...that's a first
<p>
@you become from a figment of my imagination, to a living soul. created
<p>
@out of the human need to perpatrate our existence in the universe.
<p>
@heh
<p>
@of course, if you rip out the metaphors, then you can relate this to
"life".
<p>
god's would then exist out of pure faith that they do
<p>
@but if you take this literally, then you will have some serious brain
damage.
<p>
@exactly.
<p>
in ancient greece the greek gods would have truly existed
<p>
@god doesnt exist because he think...it is only because we will him to
<p>
@exist.
<p>
@in ancient greece, the gods were prolly evolved humans.
<p>
I always thought that they were cast out angels
<p>
@a strain of humans, that had understood our hallucination, and come to
<p>
@learn how to utilise it.
<p>
@cast out angels if you wish.
<p>
@that is all relative.
<p>
find a weakness in the system and exploit it....they hacked...us?
<p>
@yep.
<p>
@that is all we do 24/7
<p>
what a f*ck*ng CONCEPT!
<p>
@heh
<p>
@the cool thing tho, is that eventually all figments become reality.
<p>
@just one law of nature.
<p>
@if nature is to be a basis for our imagination.
<p>
and we are not the created...we are the creator
<p>
@exactly.

<p>
<p>
The Next Day...

<p>
I once knew a "witch" who believed excatly the same thing
<p>
as long as others believed in magic it would work
<p>
@i will never know if you created me, of if i created you, because the
<p>
@way this hallucinaiton works, is that we never know, and live a life
of
<p>
@illusions.
<p>
@we just take it for granted.
<p>
regardless of what we wish...reality will be what we perceive
<p>
@hells yea.
<p>
if we percieve our president to be a pot filanderer...he is
<p>
@every once in a while, few humans are born with an acute perception of
<p>
@this hallucination, and then they utilise it.
<p>
pot?...scratch that
<p>
@if everyone believed bill clinton didnt exist, i am sure he would
vanish.
<p>
@but we can never test that, because of the way we have fashioned this
illusion.
<p>
which would explain psychics....those who sort of listen to the network
as a whole
<p>
@exactly.
<p>
or percieve what the network will do next
<p>
@if you view this from the POV of a topography, you can see, that we
are
<p>
@just particles of a grander atom.
<p>
@at some level our actions can be predicted justlike we can predict
atoms
<p>
@etc.
<p>
@well that is my lil stop on existence.
<p>
I love it...I'll be thinking about that for a while
<p>
@ive been thinking for 5-6 years now.
<p>
@im still stumped.
<p>
reminds me of your philosophy....are we really out of the game?
<p>
@heh
