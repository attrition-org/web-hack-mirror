    <p><font size="5"><b>From America's Front Line Against Crime:
    </b></font></p>
    <p><font size="5"><b>A School and Youth Violence Prevention
    Plan</b></font></p>
    <p>As an organization of 400 police chiefs, sheriffs,
    prosecutors and crime survivors, we are determined to see
    that dangerous criminals are put behind bars. But anyone who
    thinks that jailing a criminal undoes the agony crime leaves
    in its wake hasn't seen crime up close.</p>
    <p>America's anti-crime arsenal contains no weapons more
    powerful than the proven programs that help kids get the
    right start &amp;emdash like quality educational child care,
    youth development programs for the after-school and summer
    hours, child abuse prevention, and intervention programs
    proven to help get troubled kids back on track.</p>
    <p>Yet today, inadequate funding for Head Start, child care,
    after-school youth development programs and counseling for
    troubled kids leaves millions of children at needless risk of
    becoming violent or delinquent teens and adult criminals
    &amp;emdash and every American at needless risk of becoming a
    victim.</p>
    <p><b>We call on all public officials to adopt a four-part
    plan to dramatically reduce youth violence and adult crime,
    and help young people learn the skills and values they need
    to become good neighbors and responsible adults. While no
    plan can prevent every violent act, this common sense plan
    &amp;emdashbased on our experience and the latest research
    about what really works to fight crime &amp;emdash can make
    all of us safer.</b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font size="4"><b>Four Steps to Dramatically Reduce School
    and Youth Violence</b></font></p>
    <p><b>1. Assure all of America's school-age children and
    teens access to after-school, weekend and summer youth
    development programs to shut down the &quot;Prime Time for
    Juvenile Crime&quot;.</b></p>
    <p>In the hour after the school bell rings, juvenile crime
    suddenly triples and prime time for juvenile crime begins.On
    school days, the peak hours for such crime are from 3:00 PM
    to 6:00 PM. These are also the hours when kids are most
    likely to become victims of crime.1 They are the peak hours
    for teen sex, and being unsupervised after school doubles the
    risk that 8th-graders will smoke, drink alcohol or use
    drugs.2</p>
    <p>Quality youth development programs can cut crime
    immediately and transform this Prime Time for Juvenile Crime
    into hours of academic enrichment, wholesome fun and
    community service. They protect both kids and adults from
    becoming victims of crime, and cut teen pregnancy, smoking,
    and drug use, while they help youngsters develop the values
    and skills they need to become contributing citizens. For
    example:</p>
    <p>&#149; When a public housing project intensively recruited
    youths to join in a new after-school program, arrests among
    its teen residents plummeted to one-fourth of their previous
    level, while those among the teens who lived in a nearby
    comparison project were actually going up by two-thirds.3</p>
    <p>&#149; High school freshmen boys randomly selected from
    welfare households to participate in the Quantum
    Opportunities after-school program were only one-sixth as
    likely to be convicted of a crime 5during the high school
    years as those not selected. Together, the boys and girls who
    participated in the program were 50% more likely to graduate
    high school on time.4</p>
    <p>&#149; Young people who received a Big Brothers/Big
    Sisters mentor were half as likely to begin illegal drug use
    or to hit someone as applicants randomly assigned to a
    waiting list.5</p>
    <p>In short, failing to provide programs like these can
    multiply by as much as four times your family&#146;s risk
    that at-risk kids will become delinquent.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font size="4"><b>2. Assure all babies and preschool
    children access to the quality educational child care</b></font><font
    size="5"><b> </b></font><font size="4"><b>programs proven to
    cut crime.</b></font></p>
    <p>Rigorous studies, hard experience, and brain pictures from
    modern medical equipment tell the same story: In the first
    few years of life, children&#146;s intellects and emotions,
    and even their ability to feel concern for others &#151; a
    prerequisite to &#147;conscience&#148;&#151; are being
    permanently shaped. When parents are at work trying to make
    ends meet, programs providing nurturing, stimulating,
    educational child care for babies and toddlers can not only
    prepare children to succeed in school but also dramatically
    reduce crime.6 For example:</p>
    <p>&#149; In Ypsilanti, Michigan, low-income three- and
    four-year-olds randomly assigned to be in the High/Scope
    Educational Research Foundation&#146;s preschool program were
    only one-fifth as likely to have become chronic lawbreakers
    at age 27, compared to similar children who did without this
    educational child care.7</p>
    <p>&#149; In Syracuse, at-risk infants and toddlers enrolled
    in a quality child development program, with parenting
    support for their mothers, were only one-tenth as likely as
    similar children to be delinquent ten years later.8</p>
    <p>In other words, failing to make sure that at-risk kids
    have access to quality child care and development programs
    like these can multiply by five to ten times the risk that
    they will grow up to lead a life of crime. When millions of
    struggling parents are forced to leave their children in
    inadequate child care, we all pay a terrible price.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font size="4"><b>3. Help schools identify troubled and
    disruptive children at an early age, and provide children and
    their parents with the counseling and training that can help
    kids get back on track.</b></font></p>
    <p>When elementary school children display disruptive
    behavior, it is a warning signal that it is time to start
    looking for the causes of the problem, andto provide the
    proven social skills training, counseling, and other help for
    the children and their families that can lead them back to a
    healthier path. For example:</p>
    <p>&#149; A Montreal study showed that providing disruptive
    first- and second-grade boys with services like these cut in
    half the odds that they would later be in special classes,
    rated highly disruptive by a teacher or by peers, or have
    been required to repeat a grade in school &#151; all signs
    that the risk of future violence has been sharply reduced.9</p>
    <p>&#149; Five years after randomly selected disruptive,
    low-achieving seventh-grade students completed a three-year
    program involving behavioral therapy and rewards, they were
    only one-third as likely to have a juvenile record as those
    who did not receive these services.10</p>
    <p><font size="4"><b>4. Prevent child abuse and neglect by:
    a) Providing enough well-trained child protective services
    staff to protect endangered children; and b) Offering all
    high-risk parents the in-home parenting-coaching programs
    that have been proven to cut in half both abuse and neglect
    and subsequent teen delinquency.</b></font></p>
    <p>Being abused or neglected multiplies the risk that a child
    will grow up to be a violent teen or adult. With almost three
    million American children reported as abused or neglected in
    1995, we need to make sure that child protective services
    staff have sufficient resources to identify and treat abused
    or neglected children. We also must act before children are
    hurt by expanding the programs proven to reduce cases of
    abuse and neglect. For example:</p>
    <p>&#149; The Prenatal and Early Infancy Project randomly
    assigned half of a group of at-risk mothers to receive visits
    by specially trained nurses who provide coaching in parenting
    skills and other advice and support. Rigorous studies show
    the program not only reduced child abuse by 80% in the first
    two years, but that fifteen years after the services ended,
    these mothers had only one-third as many arrests, and their
    children were only half as likely to be delinquent.11 </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font size="4"><b>The Bottom Line: Investing in Kids Saves
    Lives and Money</b></font></p>
    <p>When America fails to invest in its children and youth, we
    pay far more later &#151; not just in lives and fear, but
    also in tax dollars. The federal treasury will actually have
    more money to dedicate to other uses a few years from now
    &#151; whether for social security, paying off the
    accumulated national debt, or tax cuts &#151; if we invest
    today in programs to help kids get the right start. For
    example:</p>
    <p>&#149; Economist Steven Barnett found that the High/Scope
    Foundation&#146;s Perry Preschool study saved $150,000 per
    participant in crime costs alone. Even after subtracting the
    interest that could have been earned by investing the
    program&#146;s funding in financial markets, the project
    produced a net savings of $7.16 &#151; including more than
    six dollars in crime savings &#151; for every dollar
    invested.</p>
    <p>&#149; Barnett estimates that the cost, including
    increased crime and welfare costs, of failing to provide at
    least two years of quality educational child care to
    low-income children is approximately $100,000 per child.
    That&#146;s a total of about $400 billion for all poor
    children now under age five.12</p>
    <p>&#149; A recent study by Professor Mark A. Cohen of
    Vanderbilt University estimates that for each high-risk youth
    prevented from adopting a life of crime, the country would
    save $1.7 million.13</p>
    <p>&#149; A recent Rand Corporation report shows that, even
    without counting the savings to crime victims and society,
    the resulting savings to government alone from effective
    early childhood programs exceeds by two to four times the
    cost of the programs.14</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font size="4"><b>Law Enforcement United in Calling for
    Crime-Prevention Investments in Kids</b></font></p>
    <p>Who says these four steps are among our most powerful
    weapons to fight crime?</p>
    <p>&#149; The hundreds of law enforcement leaders and crime
    victims who make up Fight Crime: Invest in Kids.</p>
    <p>&#149; Over the last six months, virtually every major
    national law enforcement organization -- including the <strong>Major
    Cities [Police] Chiefs' Organization</strong>, <strong>the
    Police Executive Research Forum</strong>, the <strong>National
    Sheriffs' Association</strong>, and the <strong>National
    District Attorneys' Association</strong> &#151; have adopted
    forceful calls for boosting critical crime prevention
    investments like these.</p>
    <p><font color="#000000">&#149; In a George Mason University
    poll, 86 percent of police chiefs nationwide said,
    &quot;expanding after-school and child care programs like
    Head Start will greatly reduce youth crime and
    violence.&quot; Nine out of ten chiefs agreed with the
    statement, &quot;If America does not make greater investments
    in after-school and educational child care programs to help
    children and youth now, we will pay far more later in crime,
    welfare and other costs.</font>15 </p>
