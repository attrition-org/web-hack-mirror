    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we help kids get the
    right start, the risk that they will become teen delinquents
    or adult criminals plummets &amp;emdash and so does the risk
    that they will smoke, use drugs, or become pregnant as teens.
    What really works to reduce all these risks?</font></p>

    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>After-School
    Programs</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Good after-school programs
    keep kids out of harm&#146;s way while teaching the skills
    and core values they need to succeed. We know that the peak
    hours of violent juvenile crime are 3 PM to 9 PM, and that
    good after-school programs in high crime areas can cut by as
    much as 3/4 the high school student&#146;s risk of becoming
    involved in crime. And being supervised after school <b>cuts
    in half</b> the risk that middle school kids will <b>smoke,
    drink, or abuse drugs</b>,</font><font size="1" face="Arial">
    </font><font size="2" face="Arial">and <b>reduces teen
    pregnancy</b> as well.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Early
    Childhood Education</b></font> </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Enrolling kids in the
    High/Scope Perry Pre-school program <b>cut by 4/5 the risk
    they would grow up to be chronic lawbreakers</b> &amp;endash
    and <b>cut by 1/5 the risk that they would become smokers</b></font><font
    size="1" face="Arial">.</font></p>
    <p><font size="1" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Parenting
    Education </b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Providing parent-coaching home
    visits to low-income mothers beginning prenatally up to age
    two <b>halved</b> the risk that their children would be <b>delinquent
    at age 15</b>, and <b>cut nearly in half their
    children&#146;s cigarette smoking</b>.</font><font size="1"
    face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Equally
    important, the visits cut mothers&#146; smoking during
    pregnancy by more than 27%. Such smoking puts babies at risk
    of miscarriage, learning disabilities and behavior problems.
    Among women who were smokers when they became pregnant, the
    visits cut premature births by 3/4.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Saving Money
    and Lives</b></font> </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Each day we fail to make
    proven investments like these, we multiply kids&#146; risk of
    smoking and every American&#146;s risk of crime. The RAND
    Corporation and others have also shown that these investments
    actually save tax dollars by cutting crime and other costs.
    The bottom line: We&#146;ll actually have more money to spend
    in the future &amp;endash whether on public health or tax
    cuts &amp;endash if we invest now in quality educational
    child care, parenting-support, and after-school programs.
    These are among our most powerful weapons against crime,
    smoking, drug use and teen pregnancy.</font></p>
