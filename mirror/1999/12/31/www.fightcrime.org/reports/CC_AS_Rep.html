<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4" face="New York"><b>We must spare no effort</b></font><font face="New York"> in making sure that dangerous criminals are
behind bars. But that strategy by itself will never be enough to
make our communities safe. Police, prosecutors, crime survivors,
criminologists and child development experts all report the same
conclusion: <b>Quality educational child care for preschool
children and after-school programs for school-age kids are among
the most powerful weapons in America&#146;s anti-crime arsenal.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="New York">The time for philosophical debate about
whether such investments &quot;might work&quot; is over. The
proof is in: Good child care and after-school youth development
programs for at-risk youngsters sharply reduce crime and help
children develop the skills and values to become good neighbors
and responsible adults instead of criminals. When we fail to
invest in the proven programs that help kids get the right start,
we all pay an enormous price.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">It is time to cut crime&#146;s most
important supply line: Its ability to turn America&#146;s kids
into criminals. </font></p>

Child Development Programs:</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="CopprplGoth Bd BT,Times New Roman"><b>Proven
to Cut Crime Dramatically</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="New York"><b>&quot;Our fight
against crime needs to start in the high chair, </b>not wait for
the electric chair,&quot; says Winston-Salem (NC) Chief of Police
George Sweat.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">He&#146;s right.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">Powerful evidence from one study after
another proves that quality child care in the first five years of
life can greatly reduce the risk that today&#146;s babies and
toddlers will become tomorrow&#146;s juvenile delinquents and
criminals.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">The early childhood development programs
for at-risk children which have proven most effective in
preventing future delinquency and crime are those which, like the
Head Start program for three-and four-year-olds and the Early
Head Start program for children younger than three, supplement
educational day care with programs to involve parents and to
coach and support them in child-rearing.</font><font size="1" face="New York">1</font><font face="New York"> For example:</font></p>

<dir>
    <li><font face="ACaslon Regular,Times New Roman">_ A
        High/Scope Foundation study at the Perry Preschool in
        Michigan offered at-risk three- and four-year-olds a
        quality Head Start-style preschool program, supplemented
        by weekly in-home coaching for parents. Twenty-two years
        later, those who had been denied the services as toddlers
        were<b><i> </i></b><i>five times more likely</i> to be
        chronic lawbreakers by age 27.</font><font size="1" face="ACaslon Regular,Times New Roman">2</font><p><font face="New York">_ A similar program in Syracuse,
        providing child development and health services for
        at-risk infants and toddlers and parenting support for
        their mothers and fathers, found that kids denied the
        services were <i>ten times more likely</i> to be
        delinquent by age 16.</font><font size="1" face="New York">3</font></p>
    </li>
</dir>

<p><font size="4" face="ACaslon Bold,Times New Roman">One of the
most effective ways</font><font face="New York"> to provide
coaching in parenting skills for at-risk parents is through home
visits to those parents who want help. Home visitor programs have
been proven to strikingly reduce child abuse and neglect while
they improve parenting, help children develop into good
neighbors, and even reduce the risk that the parent will engage
in criminal activity.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">Although abuse and neglect are not
normally included in crime statistics, most Americans would agree
that they are among the nation&#146;s most serious crimes. If we
included them in our definition of serious crimes, abuse and
neglect would make up nearly one-fifth of all serious crimes
reported each year. Child abuse and neglect also sharply increase
the risk that a child will grow up to become a criminal.</font><font size="1" face="New York">4</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">The risk of abuse and neglect declines
when parents have adequate knowledge of how children develop in
their early years. The potential for abuse skyrockets, for
example, when a parent thinks infants are supposed to be
toilet-trained at six months, or doesn&#146;t understand that
young children &quot;go to pieces&quot; when they are tired, or
doesn&#146;t know that shaking a child can cause brain damage.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">Studies show that roughly half of all
abuse and neglect among high-risk families might be eliminated if
such parents were offered family support programs, including
parenting-coaching visits to those who want them.</font><font size="1" face="New York">5</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="CopprplGoth Bd BT,Times New Roman"><b>Quality After-School
Programs Build Values and Skills While they Shut Down &quot;Prime
Time for Juvenile Crime&quot;</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="New York"><b>The peak
hours for violent juvenile crime</b></font><font face="New York">
are from 2:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. In the hour after the school bell
rings, juvenile crime suddenly <i>triples</i> and prime time for
juvenile crime begins. Half of all violent juvenile crime occurs
between 2:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., and <i>two-thirds</i><b><i> </i></b>occurs
in the nine hours between 2:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.</font><font size="1" face="New York">6</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">Quality after-school, weekend and summer
programs for children and youth can cut crime dramatically &#151;
by offering school-age kids a safe haven from negative
influences, and providing constructive activities that teach them
not only the skills they need to succeed, but also core values
like responsibility, hard work, and respect and concern for
others.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">Quality school-age programs have been
shown to have special importance for low-income youngsters,
especially those growing up in neighborhoods where &quot;hanging
out&quot; means being exposed to negative influences from peers
and from older children and adults. These youngsters learn to be
more cooperative, get along better with others resolve conflicts
more amicably, read more, participate in more academically
enriching activities, and improve grades and school conduct, when
they are provided quality after-school programs.</font><font size="1" face="New York">11</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">As the Carnegie Council on Adolescent
Development observed in its seminal report on youth development
programs, &quot;risk will be transformed into opportunity&quot;
when we provide young people with the out-of-school youth
development programs that can turn &quot;their non-school hours
into the time of their lives.&quot;</font><font size="1" face="New York">12</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="CopprplGoth Bd BT,Times New Roman"><b>Child
Care: A System In Crisis</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="New York"><b>Our nation&#146;s child care
system is in crisis.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="New York">As this decade began, the Committee for
Economic Development, made up of executives from America&#146;s
largest corporations, declared, &quot;The lack of availability of
quality child care that is developmentally appropriate, has
educational value, and is affordable has created a crisis of
national proportions that affects most families but hits
low-income families the hardest.&quot;</font><font size="1" face="New York">13</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">As we near the end of the decade, that
crisis has worsened. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="New York"><b>As of 1995, </b></font><font face="New York">more than three out of five women with children
younger than six, and more than three out of four women with
school-age children, were working outside the home.</font><font size="1" face="New York">14</font><font face="New York"> Even
among mothers of one-year-olds, more than half work full- or
part-time.</font><font size="1" face="New York">15</font><font face="New York"> For many of these parents, especially those at
the bottom of the income ladder, debate about whether they should
work or stay home ignores reality. </font></p>

<p><font face="New York">With full-time work at the minimum wage
bringing in about $9,000 a year after social security taxes, many
families find that they can&#146;t possibly make ends meet and
provide for their children unless both parents work outside the
home. Moreover, one out of four children live with only one
parent,</font><font size="1" face="New York">16</font><font face="New York"> and half of all children can now expect to live
an average of at least five years in a single-parent family.</font><font size="1" face="New York">17</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">In some two-parent, middle-income
families, adjustments in the tax code may modestly affect
parental decisions to work outside the home. But such measures
are no substitute for ensuring access to quality child care in
the pre-school years, and quality after-school, summer and
weekend child and youth development programs for our most at-risk
population &#151; the youngsters who must be our first crime
prevention priority. </font></p>

<p><font face="New York">The issue for many families &#151; and
for law enforcement &#151; is not whether parents will work. It
is whether the care children receive while their parents are
working will be good enough to help the kids get a good start in
life, or whether it will be care that damages their development
and ultimately damages the public safety.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="New York"><b>Today, quality child care
and after-school programs</b></font><font face="New York"> are
financially out of reach for millions of America&#146;s most
at-risk children and youth. Their families &#151; mostly young
and still near the lowest earning levels of their working lives
&#151; can no more afford to pay for quality child care during
these years than they could afford to pay the full cost of the
education we provide through public schools.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">Yet the Head Start child development
program for at-risk preschoolers is so underfunded it can reach
just four in ten eligible kids &#151; and usually for just half
of their parents&#146; work day, for only part of the year. And
despite all the evidence that the first three years of life are
critical to brain development, programs like Early Head Start,
designed for kids under three, have funds to serve only a tiny
fraction of the babies and toddlers who need them.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">Meanwhile, the Child Care and
Development Block Grant, which assits communities in helping
working families afford quality care, today can serve only one in
ten of the kids who most need it. Parenting education and family
resource programs, whether linked directly to child care or
operating separately, can serve only a tiny fraction of the
at-risk families who would benefit most. And after-school
programs are largely unavailable, especially for the children who
need them most.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="New York"><b>For those of us on the front
lines </b></font><font face="New York">of the battle against
crime, the once-quiet crisis in child care is now noisy,
pervasive, insistent, and tragic. It screams through our police
sirens rushing to yet another crime that never had to happen. It
is heard in the cries of agony of thousands of crime victims and
their families whose lives are needlessly lost or shattered each
year. It is visible as yellow crime scene tape, body bags, and
blood-stained sidewalks on the nightly news.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">If there is one point in the discussion
of child care that no American can afford to miss, it is this: If
we want our own families to be safe, we all have a stake in
making sure that every working family has access to quality child
care and after school programs, and that all at-risk families
have access to parenting education coaching.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">Make no mistake about it: <b><i>Our
nation&#146;s child care crisis is a crime prevention crisis. </i></b></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="New York"><b>That&#146;s the bad news.
The good news</b></font><font face="New York"> is that there is
no mystery about how to solve that crisis.</font></p>

consider this reminder from the business executives of the
Committee for Economic Development:</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">&quot;Education is an investment, not an
expense. If we can ensure that all children are born healthy and
develop the skills and knowledge they need to be productive,
self-supporting adults, whatever is spent on their development
and education will be returned many times over in higher
productivity, incomes, and taxes and in lower costs for welfare,
health care, crime, and myriad other economic and social
problems.&quot;</font><font size="1" face="New York">20</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="New York">&quot;The question is not whether we can
afford these programs,&quot; says former U.S. Attorney General
and Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Elliot L.
Richardson. &quot;It is whether we can afford to jeopardize the
safety of millions of Americans and saddle future generations
with the cost of failing to make these proven investments today.
When child care and after-school programs save dollars and cut
crime, why shouldn&#146;t our federal and state governments
provide the funding that will enable communities to get the job
done?&quot;</font></p>

Emerging Unanimity Among Anti-Crime Leaders</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="New York"><b>The people

are less concerned with political ideology than with hard-nosed
practical solutions. They insist on dealing with the real world
as they find it, and on doing what really works to fight crime. </font></p>

<p><font face="New York">Everyone agrees, of course, that
dangerous criminals need to be locked up. But those who work day
in and day out to track down, arrest, and prosecute criminals
know that this vital defense is only a stop-gap measure. In the
words of Baltimore Police Commissioner Thomas C. Frazier,
&quot;Police know that we cannot just arrest our way out of the
crime problem.&quot;</font></p>

children safer,&quot; says Buffalo Police Commissioner R. Gil
Kerlikowske, &quot;by investing in child care and after-school

waiting to spend far more &#151; in money and lives &#151; on
those who become America&#146;s &#145;Most Wanted&#146;

<p><font size="4" face="New York"><b>Today hundreds of our
nation&#146;s most distinguished police chiefs,</b></font><font face="New York"> sheriffs, prosecutors, crime victim advocates
and scholars have joined in calling on all public officials to
protect the public safety by adopting common sense policies to:</font></p>

<dir>
    <li><font size="1" face="Zapf Dingbats">n</font><font face="New York"> </font><font size="4" face="New York"><b>Provide
        for all infants, toddlers and preschool children access
        to quality child care at a price their parents can
        afford.</b></font></li>
</dir>

<p><font face="New York">That means child care in which staffing
levels are high enough and training good enough to assure that
children receive the nurturing and stimulation they need to start
school ready to succeed and to learn the concern for others and
other core values which begin to develop in the first years of
life. To be most effective in reducing crime, quality child care
and development programs for our most at-risk families should be
linked to parenting education and family support.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">At the federal level, this means we
should be assuring through Early Head Start or other quality
programs that our most at-risk babies and toddlers receive the
care they need from birth to age three. It means that we should
be assuring that Head Start has enough funding to serve all the
low-income children who need it, and to provide full-day,
high-quality year-round care for the children of working parents.
And it means sufficient increases in funding for the Child Care
and Development Block Grants to states so that all families will
have the help they need to access quality care.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">For states, it means that more should
follow the lead of states like North Carolina and Ohio, which
have sharply increased their own investment in quality child care
and development programs to help their children get the right
start.</font></p>

        community-based family resource programs.</b></font></li>
</dir>

<p><font face="New York">States like Missouri and Hawaii have led
the way in showing that they can implement large-scale,
effective, parenting education and family resource programs,
including coaching by home visitors for those who want them,
without intruding on family privacy. And the plain fact is, many
parents desperately need &#151; and want &#151; more knowledge
about normal child development and coaching in parenting skills.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">When at-risk parents who want to learn
more about parenting &#151; including many young parents who may
never have seen healthy parenting in their own homes &#151; are
denied that help, their children and all of us are endangered.</font></p>

</dir>

<p><font face="New York">Neither the risk that children will go
astray, nor the opportunity to help them realize their potential
to become good neighbors and responsible adults, ends when they
start school. Early childhood programs must be followed by
school-age child care and child and youth development programs.
Of course, the after-school options needed for a first-grader, an
eighth-grader, and a high school junior differ markedly from one
another. But all our youngsters, and especially those in
low-income or high-crime areas who are most at risk of
delinquency or of becoming crime victims, need access to programs
that can help them develop the skills and values they need to
succeed as adults.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">For the federal government, that will
require a major increase in a commitment currently so small that
it barely begins to be noticed. For states and localities, it may
mean implementing programs like New York City&#146;s Beacon
schools, through which community groups provide after-school
programs in coordination with schools. Other states and
localities may choose models which enable children and teens to
access the services of community organizations off the school
premises &#151; models like the Schools of the 21st Century,
sometimes called Family Resource Centers, now in over 500 schools
in 17 states, which use public schools as the hub of a network of
services, such as parenting education, full-day, high-quality
care for 3-5 year-olds, and child care before and after school
and during summer vacations.</font><font size="1" face="New York">22</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="CopprplGoth Bd BT,Times New Roman"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="New York"><b>Taken as a
whole, our federal and state governments</b></font><font face="New York"> are falling far short of the investment in child
care, parenting-education, and after-school programs needed to
meet their responsibility to protect the public safety. That
shortfall is part of a gaping crime prevention deficit that
jeopardizes the safety of every American.</font></p>

<p><font face="New York">It is time that leaders at the state and
federal level laid out a plan to eliminate that deficit. </font></p>

<p><font face="New York">We all know that the actual delivery of
services like child care and after-school programs must take
place not in our legislatures but in our communities, through
partnerships of parents, federal, state and local government, and
community organizations. But no responsibility of federal and
state government is more fundamental than protecting the public
safety. </font></p>

<p><font face="New York">That responsibility simply cannot be met
without providing communities with the resources to assure that
all families, and especially those whose children are most at
risk of going astray, have access to quality child care,
parenting-education, and after-school programs at a price they
can afford.</font></p>

                                the time children are eight or
                                nine, most of those who will grow
                                up to be criminals are already
                                showing clear signs of disruptive
                                or disturbed behavior. For
                                example, one study of
                                working-class boys in London
                                showed that eight- to

                                troublesome&quot; were eight
                                times more likely to grow up to
                                be chronic offenders than their

                                not. Many children simply go
                                through &quot;rough spots,&quot;
                                which they outgrow on their own.
                                And there is solid evidence that
                                even modest programs providing
                                social-skills training and
                                therapy for disruptive school-age

                                cut the chances of future
                                problems by 50% or more. But it

                                two or more risk factors are four
                                times as likely to develop social

                                structure). In 1997, a total of
                                21 states, led by New York, New
                                Jersey, and Connecticut,
                                increased their investments in

                                after-school programs. Although
                                the decisions by these states to
                                do so was commendable, their
