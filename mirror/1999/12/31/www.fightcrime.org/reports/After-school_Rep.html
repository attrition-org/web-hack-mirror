<font size="4" face="Helvetica"><b>Executive Summary</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino"><b>Prime Time for Juvenile
Crime</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Until recently, the only solid
data available to tell us at what time of day most juvenile crime
occurs have been data from South Carolina. These data have been
criticized because they came from only one state, and because
that state had a more modest juvenile gang problem than many
others.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">New data have been compiled
from FBI reports by the National Center on Juvenile Justice and
the Office for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. These
data which have recently become available are based on eight
states: Alabama, Colorado, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, North Dakota,
South Carolina, and Utah.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino"><b>These new data make clear
that the peak hours for violent juvenile crime are 3:00 PM to
8:00 PM. They tell us that when the school bell rings, leaving
millions of young people without responsible adult supervision or
constructive activities, juvenile crime suddenly </b><b><u>triples</u></b>
<b>and prime time for juvenile crime begins.</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Nearly half of all violent
juvenile crime takes place during the six-hour period between
2:00 PM and 8:00 PM, and nearly<b> two thirds of all violent
juvenile crime takes place during the nine hours between 2:00 PM
and 11:00 PM . In contrast, just one seventh occurs during the
eight hours from 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM, the period for which curfew
laws are often suggested.</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">This report focuses on days
when school is in session ó the days when after-school programs
could conceivably have a major impact on youth activity during
the prime time juvenile crime hours. About half of the days of
the year are school days, but 57% of violent crime committed by
juveniles occur on these days.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino"><b>Foolish Policy Choices</b></font>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">These data are a wake-up call
telling us that we as a nation are making a foolish choiceóand
paying a tragic price. When we send millions of young people out
on the streets after school with no responsible supervision or
constructive activities, we reap a massive dose of juvenile
crime. If, instead, we were to provide students with quality
after-school programs, safe havens from negative influences, and
constructive recreational, academic enrichment and community
service activities, we would dramatically reduce crime while
helping students develop the values and skills they need to
become good neighbors and responsible adults. For example:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">ï Juvenile arrests declined by
75% when an after-school recreation program was instituted in a
housing project, while they were rising by 67% in a comparison
housing project.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">ï Boys And Girls Clubs
operating in housing projects cut juvenile arrests by 13% and
drug activity by 22% compared to projects without a Club.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">ï Denying at-risk high school
kids participation in a special Quantum Opportunities Program of
counseling, academic and life-skills support and other incentives
quadrupled their risk of being arrested while in high school.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">ï A University of Wisconsin
Study of 64 after-school programs found that programs reduced
vandalism, and promoted better behavior and improved academic
performance of participants.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino"><b>Decisions Ahead</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Americaís leaders must decide
whether they are ready to invest in the after-school programs
which can ensure that the school dismissal bell signals the start
of a rich afternoon of constructive child and youth development
and of community service rather than the start of a daily surge
in juvenile crime.</font> </p>

PM-8:00 PM</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Palatino">The evidence is
indisputable. After spiking between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM, violent
juvenile crime begins a steady drop until 7:00 AM the next
morning, and remains low until school is dismissed the next day.
This pattern is illustrated below.</font> <br>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Palatino">The hour
immediately following school dismissal (3:00 PM-4:00 PM) yields
three times as much juvenile crime as the hour from 1:00 PM-2:00

<img src="../images/CRGraph2.gif" width="406" height="247"> </p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Palatino">Almost half
(45.4%) of all violent juvenile crime on school days takes place
between 2:00 in the afternoon, when youngsters begin to be let
out of school, and 8:00 in the evening. An additional 17.9% takes
place between 8:00 PM and 11:00 PM., for a total of almost two
thirds (63%) taking place in this eight-hour after-school and
evening time period. In contrast, only about one seventh (14.6%)
of all juvenile crime takes place during the ìgraveyard shiftî
from 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM.</font> <br>

days, and, like other juvenile crime, it peaks immediately

<p align="center"><font face="Helvetica"><b>II. Impact of
After-School Programs on Juvenile Crime</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Quality after-school (and
summer) programs can be expected to reduce juvenile crime in two
ways:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino"><b>A. Immediate ìSafe Haven
and Controlî Effects. </b>Immediately upon implementation,
after-school programs provide responsible adult supervision,
constructive activities, and insulation from deleterious pressure
from peers and older children during high-risk hours. By
replacing unsupervised hours spent exposed to dangerous
influences on a street corner with hours spent under supervision,
after-school programs might be expected to eliminate all or most
of the crimes participating youngsters might otherwise commit
during those hours.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">If the juvenile violent crime
rate for the period from 3:00 PM-8:00 PM were brought down to
school-hour levels, this would eliminate nearly one quarter (23%)
of all juvenile violent crime committed on school days. (Of
course, investments in weekend and summer programs could also be
expected to have a major impact on crime committed on days when
school is not in session, but consideration of that impact is
reserved for a future analysis.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Of course, not all youngsters
would participate in after-school programs even if a wide variety
of high-quality programs were available. It is difficult to
predict voluntary participation rates, much less to predict how
many teens might be required to participate by their parents. In
addition, if quality after-school programs were accessible to all
families, some localities might choose to require for children of
specified ages that parents either provide supervision
themselves, or make arrangements for alternative adult
supervision. As a result, the immediate ìcontrol impactî would
fall somewhat short of the one-quarter to one-third reduction
which might otherwise be indicated.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino"><b>B. Values and Skills Effect
-- beginning quickly and building steadily. </b>Recent research
makes clear that the impact of after-school and other quality
programs for children and youth far exceeds the <b>ìSafe Haven
and Controlî</b> effect. Beginning in the first months and
building steadily, quality after-school programs can be expected
to have an enormous impact on the attitudes, values and skills of
participating children.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Children spend only about one
hour in school for every five hours awake. How they spend the
other four hours, not surprisingly, plays a major role in their
development. Quality programs help children learn the skills they
need to succeed academically, gain experience in serving their
communities, and develop the attitudes, values and skills they
need to contribute as good neighbors, family members and
citizens.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino"><b>1. Developmental risks for
latchkey children and youth.</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">The need for after-school care
has grown dramatically in recent years. In 1970, 37% of families
with children under eighteen--already a very substantial
percentage-- lacked full-time parental supervision. By 1992, that
percentage had increased to 57%. Part of this increase is
attributable to the growing number of single-parent families due
to both increasing divorce and increasing out-of-wedlock births.
However, two-thirds of this increase is a result of the increased
number of families in which both parents work outside the home,
often by necessity.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Today, an estimated 17 million
parents need care for their school-aged children. Experts
estimate that between five and seven million ìlatchkey
childrenî go home alone after school, and that roughly 35% of
twelve-year-olds are regularly left to fend for themselves while
their parents are at work.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Latchkey children are at
significantly greater risk of truancy, receiving poor grades, and
risk-taking behavior including substance abuse. The more hours
they spend on their own, and the earlier they begin doing so, the
greater the risk. Eighth-graders who were unsupervised for eleven
or more hours per week were twice as likely to abuse drugs or
alcohol as those under adult supervision.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Even among those who have adult
supervision, the quality of their after-school care varies
widely-- and matters a great deal.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">We know, for example, that
children spend more of their out-of-school time watching TV than
any other activity. Childrenís television viewing has been
associated with lower reading achievement, behavioral problems,
and increased aggression. When children watch more than three
hours a day of television or watch violent programs, these risks
increase.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">While upper middle-class
families are often able to patch together a series of lessons or
other activities to fill much of their out-of-school time, many
children are left to spend their out-of-school time at home alone
or on a dangerous street corner. This problem has been
exacerbated by funding cuts for youth programs beginning in the
early 1980's.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Children, especially
adolescents, crave excitement and group activity. If they canít
find it in programs organized by responsible adults, they become
far more likely to find it in gangs. Too many children today have
too little access to structured activity with positive role
models, and are left to spend too much time ìhanging outî or
watching a few savage killings on television.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino"><b>2. Proven Developmental
Benefits from after-school programs</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Just as it is now clear that
the lack of adult supervision and quality programs in the
after-school hours places children at risk, it is clear that
quality after-school programs have important impacts which are
revealed in immediate crime reduction and enhanced experiences
and characteristics which have been shown to be important
ìprotective factors,î making children less likely to engage in
crime.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">For example, a study of a
32-month after-school recreation program in a Canadian public
housing project compared arrests of juveniles with those of
another housing project providing only minimal recreational
services. Compared to the two years prior to the program, the
number of juvenile arrests declined by 75% during the course of
the program in the experimental project, but increased by 67% in
the comparison project. Such dramatic results cannot be explained
strictly on the basis of an &quot;immediate control&quot; impact.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">A Columbia University study of
housing projects in which Boys and Girls Clubs had been
established as a part of the Justice Department's Operation Weed
and Seed program showed that juvenile arrests were 13% lower than
in projects without a Club. Moreover, drug activity was 22% lower<b>
</b>in projects with a Club.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">A recent study of low-income
children attending high-quality after-school programs showed that
they got along better with their peers and had better grades,
school conduct and emotional adjustment than other children.
These children also had more learning opportunities and spent
more time in academic or academically enriching activities and
less time watching television.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Similarly, a recent University
of Wisconsin Study of 64 after-school programs supported by the
Cooperative Extension Service found that teachers reported that
these programs had helped children become more cooperative and
better at handling conflicts. These children also developed
greater interest in recreational reading and received better
grades. Strikingly, a full third of the school principals at
these sites claimed that vandalism at the school had decreased as
a result of the programs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Additional evidence comes from
school enrichment, mentoring, and neighborhood activity programs
which show what a critical difference constructive use of
out-of-school time can make. For example, a Public/Private
Ventures study of Big Brothers/Big Sisters' carefully designed
mentoring program showed that young people randomly assigned to
receive a mentor were only about half as likely to begin illegal
drug use during the period of study as those randomly assigned to
the control group. Among minority applicants, controls were three
times as likely as participants to start using drugs. Those who
received mentors were also 38% less likely to initiate alcohol
use during the period of study. And, in a sign that the mentoring
program had an impact on violent behavior, those in the mentoring
program were only half as likely to have hit someone during the
period of study.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Moreover, randomly assigned
participants in a high school Quantum Opportunities Program,
which incorporates counseling, academic enrichment, life skills
instruction, community service projects and financial incentives,
were less than one quarter as likely to be convicted of a crime
as those in a control group. It is important to note that while
there are long-term impacts from programs such as these, (for
example, those who participated in Quantum Opportunities were 50%
more likely to graduate high school on time and two and a half
times more likely to attend post-secondary schooling) <u>the
impact on arrests was virtually immediate</u>. The program
started when the youngsters began high school, and decreased
arrests during the four years of high school by 75%.</font> </p>

<p align="center"><br>
<br>
<font face="Helvetica"><b>Conclusion</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">It is now clear that prime time
for juvenile crime begins when the afternoon school bell rings.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">By the year 2005, the number of
teens will increase by roughly 15% as the baby boomerang
generation grows up. If we fail to invest in these children,
their increasing numbers could mean an increase in crime.
However, the concentration of violent juvenile crime in these
after-school hours makes it especially accessible to preventive
intervention.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Quality after-school programs
are a key part of the solution. It seems reasonable to postulate
that if quality after school programs were readily available to
all young people, the &quot;Safe Haven and Control&quot; effect
alone would result in a major decrease in violent juvenile crime.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">The youth development
&quot;Values and Skills Effect&quot; of such programs ó their
role in providing the adult supervision, positive role models,
and constructive activities that help youngsters develop the
values and skills they need to become responsible, contributing
citizensó would likely have an even larger crime reduction
impact.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">If after-school programs were
combined with both some of the other proven youth development
programs described in this report, and some of the early
childhood programs proven to reduce subsequent crime and
delinquency, even more dramatic reductions in crime could be
achieved.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Palatino">Until the nation makes such
investments in after-school and other programs for children and
youth, we are likely to continue to pay a heavy price in crime
and violence.</font> </p>
