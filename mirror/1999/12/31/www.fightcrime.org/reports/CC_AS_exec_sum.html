behind bars. But that strategy by itself will never be enough to
make our communities safe. Police, prosecutors, crime survivors,
criminologists and child development experts all report the same
conclusion: <b>Quality educational child care for preschool
children and after-school programs for school-age kids are among
the most powerful weapons in America's anti-crime arsenal.</b></font>
<br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p><font face="New York">The time for philosophical debate about
whether such investments &quot;might work&quot; is over. The
proof is in: Good child care and after-school youth development
programs for at-risk youngsters dramatically reduce crime and
help children develop the skills and values to become good
neighbors and responsible adults instead of criminals.When we
fail to invest in the proven programs that help kids get the
right start, we all pay an enormous price.</font> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p><font face="New York">It is time to cut crime's most important
supply line: Its ability to turn America's kids into criminals.</font>

HIGH CHAIR</b></font><font face="New York"><b>, </b>not wait for
the electric chair,&quot; says Winston-Salem (NC) Chief of Police
George Sweat.</font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">He's right.</font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">Powerful evidence from one study after
another proves that quality child care in the first five years of
life can dramatically reduce the risk that today's babies and
toddlers will become tomorrow's juvenile delinquents and
criminals.</font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">The early childhood development programs
for at-risk children which have proven most effective in
preventing future delinquency and crime are those which, like the
Head Start program for three-and four-year-olds and the Early
Head Start program for children younger than three, supplement
educational day care with program to involve parents and to coach
and support them in child-rearing.</font><font size="2"
face="New York"><sup>1</sup></font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">For example:</font> </p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="New York">A High/Scope Foundation study at
        the Perry Preschool in Michigan offered at-risk three-
        and four-year-olds a quality Head Start-style preschool
        program, supplemented by weekly in-home coaching for
        parents. Twenty-two years later, those who had been
        denied the services as toddlers were <i>five times more
        likely </i>to be chronic lawbreakers by age 27.</font><font
        size="2" face="New York"><sup>2</sup></font></li>
    <li><font face="New York">A similar program in Syracuse,
        providing child development and health services for
        at-risk infants and toddlers and parenting support for
        their mothers and fathers, found that kids denied the
        services were <i>ten times more likely </i>to be
        delinquent by age 16.</font><font size="2"
        face="New York"><sup>3</sup></font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="4" face="New York">O</font><font size="2"
face="New York">NE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS </font><font
face="New York">to provide coaching in parenting skills for
at-risk parents is through home visits to those parents who want
help. Home visitor programs have been proven to dramatically
reduce child abuse and neglect while they improve parenting, help
children develop into good neighbors, and even reduce the risk
that the parent will engage in criminal activity.</font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">Although abuse and neglect are not
normally included in crime statistics, most Americans would agree
that they are among the nation's most serious crimes. If we
included them in our definition of serious crimes, abuse and
neglect make up nearly one fifth of all serious crimes reported
each year. Child abuse and neglect also dramatically increase the
risk that a child will grow up to become a criminal.</font><font
size="2" face="New York"><sup>4</sup></font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">The risk of abuse and neglect drops when
parents have adequate knowledge of how children develop in their
early years. The potential for abuse skyrockets, for example,
when a parent thinks infants are supposed to be toilet-trained at
six months, or doesn't understand that young children &quot;go to
pieces&quot; when they are tired, or doesn't know that shaking a
child can cause brain damage.</font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">Studies show that roughly half of all
abuse and neglect among high-risk families might be eliminated if
at-risk parents were offered family support programs, including
parenting-coaching visits to those who want them.</font><font
size="2" face="New York"><sup>5</sup></font> </p>

<p><font size="4" face="New York"><b>Quality After-School
Programs Build Values and Skills While they Shut Down &quot;Prime
Time for Juvenile Crime&quot;</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="4" face="New York"><b>T</b></font><font size="2"
face="New York"><b>HE PEAK HOURS FOR VIOLENT JUVENILE CRIME<img
src="../spacer.gif" width="4" height="2"></b></font><font
face="New York">are from 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. In the hour after
the school bell rings, juvenile crime suddenly <i>triples </i>and
prime time for juvenile crime begins. Nearly half of all violent
juvenile crime occurs between 2:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., and almost
<i>two-thirds </i>occurs in the nine hours between 2:00 p.m. and
11:00 p.m.</font><font size="2" face="New York"><sup>6</sup></font>
</p>

<p><font face="New York">Quality after-school, weekend and summer
programs for children and youth can cut crime dramatically -- by
offering school-age kids a safe haven from negative influences,
and providing constructive activities that teach them not only
the skills they need to succeed, but also values like
responsibility, hard work, and respect and concern for others.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="New York">For example:</font> </p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="New York">A study compared juvenile arrests
        in a public housing project starting an after-school
        skills development program with those in another housing
        project providing only minimal recreational services. The
        number of juvenile arrests declined by 75 percent after
        the start of the after-school program, while they were
        increasing by 67 percent in the comparison project.</font><font
        size="2" face="New York"><sup>7 </sup></font><font
        face="New York">In the first year after the Baltimore
        Police Department opened an after-school program in a
        high-crime area, crime in that neighborhood dropped 42%.</font><font
        size="2" face="New York"><sup>8</sup></font></li>
    <li><font face="New York">A Public/Private Ventures study of
        Big Brothers/Big Sisters' carefully-designed mentoring
        program showed that young people randomly assigned to
        receive a trained mentor were only about half as likely
        to begin illegal drug use or to hit someone as those
        randomly assigned to the control group.</font><font
        size="2" face="New York"><sup>9</sup></font></li>
    <li><font face="New York">Participants randomly assigned to a
        high school Quantum Opportunities Program of counseling,
        academic and life skills support, community service and
        financial incentives, were less than one-quarter as
        likely to be convicted of a crime during the high-risk
        high school years as those in a control group. In other
        words, denying kids these services <i>quadrupled </i>the
        likelihood that they would be convicted of a crime while
        in high school. <i>The impact on crime was virtually
        immediate</i>, and those who participated in the program
        were 50 percent more likely to graduate high school on
        time and two-and-a-half times more likely to attend
        post-secondary schooling.</font><font size="2"
        face="New York"><sup>10 </sup></font><font
        face="New York">Programs like Quantum Opportunities show
        what can happen when after-school enrichment activities
        are integrated with in-school help for at-risk
        youngsters.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="New York">Quality school-age programs have been
shown to have special importance for low-income youngsters,
especially those growing up in neighborhoods where &quot;hanging
out&quot; means being exposed to widespread negative influences
from peers and from older children and adults. These youngsters
learn to be more cooperative, get along better with others handle
conflicts better, read more, participate in more academically
enriching activities, and have better grades and school conduct
when they are provided quality after-school programs.</font><font
size="2" face="New York"><sup>11</sup></font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">As the Carnegie Council on Adolescent
Development observed in its seminal report on youth development
programs, &quot;risk will be transformed into opportunity&quot;
when we provide young people with the out-of-school youth
development programs that can turn &quot;their non-school hours
into the time of their lives.&quot;</font><font size="2"

size="4" face="New York"><b>.</b></font><img src="../spacer.gif"
width="2" height="19"></h3>

<p><font face="New York">As this decade began, the Committee for
Economic Development, made up of executives from America's
largest corporations, declared &quot;The lack of availability of
quality child care that is developmentally appropriate, has
educational value, and is affordable has created a crisis of
national proportions that affects most families but hits
low-income families the hardest.&quot;</font><font size="2"
face="New York"><sup>13</sup></font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">As we near the end of the decade, that
crisis has escalated.</font> </p>

<p><font size="4" face="New York"><b>A</b></font><font size="2"
face="New York"><b>S OF </b></font><font size="4" face="New York"><b>1995,
</b></font><font face="New York">more than three out of five
women with children younger than six, and more than three out of
four women with school-age children, were working outside the
home.</font><font size="2" face="New York"><sup>14</sup></font><font
face="New York"> Even among mothers of one-year-olds, more than
half work full- or part-time.</font><font size="2"
face="New York"><sup>15 </sup></font><font face="New York">For
many of these parents, especially those at the bottom of the
income ladder, debate about whether they should work or stay home
ignores reality.</font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">With full-time work at the minimum wage
bringing in about $9,000 a year after social security taxes, many
families find that they can't possibly make ends meet and provide
for their children unless both parents work outside the home.
Meanwhile, one out of four children live with only one parent,</font><font
size="2" face="New York"><sup>16 </sup></font><font
face="New York">and half of all children can now expect to live
an average of at least five years in a single-parent family.</font><font
size="2" face="New York"><sup>17</sup></font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">While adjustments in the tax code may
modestly affect parental decisions to work outside the home in
some two-parent, middle- income families, such measures are no
substitute for ensuring access to quality child care in the
pre-school years, and quality after-school, summer and weekend
child and youth development programs for our most at-risk
population -- the youngsters who must be our first crime
prevention priority.</font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">The issue for many families -- and for
law enforcement -- is not whether parents will work. It is
whether the care children receive while their parents are working
will be good enough to help the kids get a good start in life, or
whether it will be care that damages their development and
ultimately damages the public safety.</font> </p>

<p><font size="4" face="New York"><b>T</b></font><font size="2"

size="2" face="New York"><b>SCHOOL PROGRAMS </b></font><font
face="New York">are financially out of reach for millions of
America's most at-risk children and youth. Their families --
mostly young and still near the lowest earning levels of their
working lives -- can no more afford to pay for quality child care
during these years than they could afford to pay the full cost of
the education we provide through public schools.</font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">Yet the Head Start child development
program for at-risk preschoolers is so underfunded it can reach
just four in ten eligible kids -- and usually for just half of
their parents' work day, for only part of the year. And despite
all the evidence that the first three years of life are critical
to brain development, programs like Early Head Start, designed
for kids under three, have funds to serve only a tiny fraction of
the babies and toddlers who need them.</font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">Meanwhile, the Child Care and
Development Block Grant helps communities help working families
afford quality care -- but today it can serve only one in ten of
the kids who most need it. Parenting education and family
resource programs, whether linked directly to child care or
operating separately, can serve only a tiny fraction of the
at-risk families who would benefit most. And after-school
programs are largely unavailable, especially for the children who
need them most.</font> </p>

crisis in child care is now noisy, pervasive, insistent, and
tragic. It screams through our police sirens rushing to yet
another crime that never had to happen. It is heard in the cries
of agony of thousands of crime victims and their families whose
lives are needlessly lost or shattered each year. It is visible
as yellow crime scene tape, body bags, and blood-stained
sidewalks on the nightly news.</font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">If there is one point in the discussion
of child care that no American can afford to miss, it is this: If
we want our own families to be safe, we all have a stake in
making sure that every working family has access to quality child
care and after school programs, and that all at-risk families
have access to parenting education coaching.</font> </p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="New York">Economist Steven Barnett found that
        the High/Scope Foundation's Perry Preschool study saved
        $150,000 per participant in crime costs alone. Even after
        subtracting the interest that could have been earned by
        investing the program's funding in financial markets, the
        project produced a net savings of $7.16 -- including more
        than six dollars in crime savings -- for every dollar
        invested.</font><font size="2" face="New York"><sup>18</sup></font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="New York">Barnett estimates that the cost,
including increased crime and welfare costs among others, of
failing to provide at least two years of quality early childhood
care and education to low-income children is approximately
$100,000 per child. That's a total of about $400 billion for all
poor children now under five.</font> </p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="New York">A recent unpublished study prepared
        by Professor Mark A.Cohen of Vanderbilt University
        estimates that each high-risk youth prevented from
        adopting a life of crime could save the country from $1.7
        million to $2.3 million.</font><font size="2"

<font face="New York">&quot;Education is an investment, not an

develop the skills and knowledge they need to be productive,
self-supporting adults, whatever is spent on their development

productivity, incomes, and taxes and in lower costs for welfare,
health care, crime, and myriad other economic and social

safety of millions of Americans and saddle future generations
with the cost of failing to make these proven investments today.

dangerous criminals need to be locked up. But those who work day
in and day out to track down, arrest, and prosecute criminals

community-based family resource programs.</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">States like Missouri and Hawaii have led
the way in showing that they can implement large-scale,
effective, parenting education and family resource programs,
including coaching by home visitors for those who want them,
without intruding on family privacy. And the plain fact is, many
parents desperately need -- and want -- more knowledge about
normal child development and coaching in parenting skills.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="New York">When at-risk parents who want to learn
more about parenting -- including many young parents who may
never have seen healthy parenting in their own homes -- are
denied that help, their children and all of us are endangered.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="4" face="New York"><b>Provide for all of America's
school-age children and teens access to after-school, weekend and
summer programs that offer recreation, academic support and
community service experience.</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">Neither the risk that children will go
astray, nor the opportunity to help them realize their potential
to become good neighbors and responsible adults, ends when they
start school. Early childhood programs must be followed by
school-age child care and child and youth development programs.
Of course, the after-school options needed for a first-grader, an
eighth-grader, and a high school junior differ markedly from one
another. But all our youngsters, and especially those in
low-income or high-crime areas who are most at risk of
delinquency or of becoming crime victims, need access to programs
that can help them develop the skills and values they need to
succeed as adults.</font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">For the federal government, that will
require a major increase in a commitment currently so small that
it barely begins to be noticed. For states and localities, it may
mean implementing programs like New York City's Beacon schools,
through which community groups provide after-school programs in
coordination with schools. Other states and localities may choose
models which enable children and teens to access the services of
community organizations off the school premises -- models like
the Schools of the 21st Century, sometimes called Family Resource
Centers, now in over 500 schools in 17 states, which use public
schools as the hub of a network of services, such as parenting
education, full-day, high-quality care for 3-5 year-olds, and
child care before and after school and during summer vacations.</font><font

<p><font face="New York">falling far short of the investment in
child care, parenting education,and after school programs needed
to meet their responsibility to protect the public safety. That
shortfall is part of a gaping crime prevention deficit that
jeopardizes the safety of every American.</font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">It is time that leaders at the state and
federal level laid out a plan to eliminate that deficit.</font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">We all know that the actual delivery of
services like child care and after-school programs must take
place not in our legislatures but in our communities, through
partnerships of parents, federal, state and local government, and
community organizations. But no responsibility of federal and
state government is more fundamental than protecting the public
safety.</font> </p>

<p><font face="New York">That responsibility simply cannot be met
without providing communities with the resources to assure that
all families, and especially those whose children are most at
risk of going astray, have access to quality child care,
parenting education, and after school programs at a price they
can afford.</font> <br>
