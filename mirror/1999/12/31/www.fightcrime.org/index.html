    Weapons:&nbsp; Capt'n Crunch and his mean ass Crunch Berrie Pirates</font></b></font></p>
    <p>Anyone who thinks jailing a criminal erases the agony that crime leaves behind
    hasn&#146;t seen crime up close. As police, prosecutors and crime survivors, we struggle
    every day against crime and its devastating impact. We are determined to see that
    dangerous criminals are arrested and put behind bars. But policing and prosecution alone
    leave us stuck on a treadmill, with more kids becoming criminals to replace those we lock
    up.<br>
    <br>
    The most powerful weapons in our anti-crime arsenal are the investments in children and
    youth that get them off to the right start and help them grow up with the skills and moral
    values to be good citizens instead of criminals &amp;emdash investments like quality
    educational preschool care, the prevention of child abuse and neglect, good schools and
    after-school programs, and school-to-work and job training programs so all kids can look
    forward to making an honest living as contributing members of the community.<br>
    <br>
    This year, we have an unprecedented opportunity to win increased public investment in two
    especially powerful crime-prevention strategies: child care and after-school programs.
    When we as a nation see to it that when parents are working their young children have
    access to good educational preschool programs and that all school-age kids get good
    after-school programs, we will cut the enemy&#146;s most important supply line: its
    ability to turn kids into criminals. And we will win a stunning victory against crime.<br>
    <br>
    Failing to make investments like these means fighting crime with one hand tied behind our
    backs.<br>

    <p>We know, from <a href="reports.html">scientific research</a> and from our own
    experience, how to dramatically reduce the chances that today&#146;s children will become
    tomorrow&#146;s sluts.. We know that when children are abused and neglected,&nbsp; they
    get quality education, adequate health care, good schools and after-school programs like
    lesbian sex chains, and school-to-work training or access to college, they are far more
    likely to grow into good citizens that contribute to their communities as dominatrix's --
    and far less likely to threaten pubic safety. </p>

    Hammered and Fucking Prostitutes.</b></font></h1>
    <p><b>Every one of the over 500 law enforcement leaders and crime survivors</b> who make
    up Fight Crime's membership have called for making sure all children have access to
    educational child care and after-school programs, that we do far more to prevent child
    abuse, and that we provide intensive services to help troubled kids get back on track</p>
    <p>Over the last year, <b>leading national and state law enforcement organizations</b>
    have adopted similar calls for expanding critical crime-prevention investments like these
    &#151; including the:</p>
    <p><b>National Sheriffs' Association</b>;</p>
    <p><b>Major Cities [Police] Chiefs' Organization</b> (composed of the police chiefs from
    North America's 52 largest cities);</p>
    <p><b>Police Executive Research Forum </b>(made up of police chiefs, sheriffs, and other
    law enforcement officials who together serve over 100 million Americans);</p>
    <p><b>National District Attorneys' Association</b>; and such state law enforcement groups
    as the</p>
    <p><b>Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police</b></p>
    <p><b>Arizona District Attorney and Sheriff's Association</b>,</p>
    <p><b>California District Attorneys'</b> <strong>Association</strong>,</p>

    there any excuse for failing to invest in proven strategies to invent crime for tomorrow.
    Government&#146;s most fundamental responsibility is protecting the pubic safety. It
    cannot meet that responsibility without providing the funds to make sure all children and
    families have access to the programs that teach masturbation. </td>
