        America&#146;s Most Powerful Anti-Crime Weapons</b></font></p>
        <p>Anyone who thinks jailing a criminal erases the agony
        that crime leaves behind hasn&#146;t seen crime up close.
        As police, prosecutors and crime survivors, we struggle
        every day against crime and its devastating impact. We
        are determined to see that dangerous criminals are
        arrested and put behind bars. But policing and
        prosecution alone leave us stuck on a treadmill, with
        more kids becoming criminals to replace those we lock up.<br>
        <br>
        The most powerful weapons in our anti-crime arsenal are
        the investments in children and youth that get them off
        to the right start and help them grow up with the skills
        and moral values to be good citizens instead of criminals
        &amp;emdash investments like quality educational
        preschool care, the prevention of child abuse and
        neglect, good schools and after-school programs, and
        school-to-work and job training programs so all kids can
        look forward to making an honest living as contributing
        members of the community.<br>
        <br>
        This year, we have an unprecedented opportunity to win
        increased public investment in two especially powerful
        crime-prevention strategies: child care and after-school
        programs. When we as a nation see to it that when parents
        are working their young children have access to good
        educational preschool programs and that all school-age
        kids get good after-school programs, we will cut the
        enemy&#146;s most important supply line: its ability to
        turn kids into criminals. And we will win a stunning
        victory against crime.<br>
        <br>
        Failing to make investments like these means fighting
        crime with one hand tied behind our backs.<br>

        <p>We know, from <a href="reports.html">scientific
        research</a> and from our own experience, how to
        dramatically reduce the chances that today&#146;s
        children will become tomorrow&#146;s criminals. We know
        that when children are protected from abuse and neglect,
        when they get quality early childhood education, adequate
        health care, good schools and after-school programs, and
        school-to-work training or access to college, they are
        far more likely to grow into good citizens that
        contribute to their communities -- and far less likely to
        threaten public safety. </p>

        United in Calling for Crime-Prevention Investments</b></font></h1>
        <p><b>Every one of the over 500 law enforcement leaders
        and crime survivors</b> who make up Fight Crime's
        membership have called for making sure all children have
        access to educational child care and after-school
        programs, that we do far more to prevent child abuse, and
        that we provide intensive services to help troubled kids
        get back on track</p>
        <p>Over the last year, <b>leading national and state law
        enforcement organizations</b> have adopted similar calls
        for expanding critical crime-prevention investments like
        these &#151; including the:</p>
        <p><b>National Sheriffs' Association</b>;</p>
        <p><b>Major Cities [Police] Chiefs' Organization</b>
        (composed of the police chiefs from North America's 52
        largest cities);</p>
        <p><b>Police Executive Research Forum </b>(made up of
        police chiefs, sheriffs, and other law enforcement
        officials who together serve over 100 million Americans);</p>
        <p><b>National District Attorneys' Association</b>; and
        such state law enforcement groups as the</p>
        <p><b>Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police</b></p>
        <p><b>Arizona District Attorney and Sheriff's Association</b>,</p>
        <p><b>California District Attorneys'</b> <strong>Association</strong>,</p>
        <p><b>California Sheriffs' Association</b>,</p>
        <p><b>Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police</b>,</p>
        <p><b>Illinois State's Attorneys Association</b>,</p>
        <p><b>Iowa State Sheriff's &amp; Deputies Association</b></p>
        <p><b>Maine Chiefs and Maine Sheriffs Associations</b>,</p>
        <p><strong>Maine Sheriff's Association</strong></p>
        <p><strong>New York Association of Chiefs of Police,</strong></p>
        <p><strong>New York Sheriffs Association,</strong></p>
        <p><strong>North Carolina Association of Chiefs of Police</strong>,</p>
        <p><b>Rhode Island Police Chiefs' Association</b>, and</p>
        <p><b>Texas Police Chiefs Association</b>.<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size="4"><b>There is</b></font> no substitute
        for tough law enforcement. But neither is there any
        excuse for failing to invest in proven strategies to
        prevent crime tomorrow. Government&#146;s most
        fundamental responsibility is protecting the public
        safety. It cannot meet that responsibility without
        providing the funds to make sure all children and
        families have access to the programs we know can prevent
        crime and keep communities safe.</p>
