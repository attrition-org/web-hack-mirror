I am back once again, If you wanted to know why I continue to deface webpages.
The answer is very simple, the only reason I continue is to 'attempt' to bring 
some light back into the scene. I am only doing this in hope that some hackers
will listen to what I have to say and perhaps follow it. Although everyone has 
a right to their own decisions, you have to distinguish what is right and what 
is not. There are so many reasons you could have for defacing, so many GOOD 
reasons, weather you use them or not is up to you. 
<p>
Also, I noticed YTCracker was on ParseTV on the 8th. This is quite surprising.
I say that because, he didn't really do anything to benefit the scene. As a 
matter of fact, nobody would know who he was without msadc.pl, he wouldn't 
have been able to deface all of those 'high profile' sites that made him a 
media whore. Well anyways... on the show, when they were talking about how 
p4riah secures his boxes, he also commented "that's what I do", but as a matter
of fact, if you checked most of the boxes he did, they were still open, he did
not secure them at all. It's not nice to lie YTCracker....
