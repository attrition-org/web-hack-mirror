You see. This site has been owned before damage 
could be done by others. This site could be rehacked if needed
Due to your choice in passwds. I would advise Using a passwd like

ThIsIs@passWd

Add upper lower and some signs like !@#$%.(Well not that lame of a passwd)


This way this cannot happen again. Well at least through this method
of entry....

Note this site has not been deleted.
