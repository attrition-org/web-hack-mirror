The Internet is one of the biggest medium.  It is a place where we can express our views/opinions freely regardless of
race/color/nationality or status in life.  Although defacing a site is not the right thing to do to get those opinions/views out, it
is the best/quickest way I can think of.  And to help get the message out, e-mailing hacked@Attrition.org and notifying them so that it'll show up
on their archive is a great way, because hundreds of people go through there everyday, maybe even more.  So while defacing is still wrong, iit's the only way for us little 
kids to voice our rants and so on.  The two PHC members are 18 and 19 I think, the last time I can remember.  They're not exactly in a good political
position to fight for what they believe in, something all of us should do.

Anyways, I'd just like to clsoe off by saying at least F1ber backed up the index.html when he last hacked this site.<br><br>

Greets/Respect to all those with a message and a good intention.
