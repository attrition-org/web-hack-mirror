To help accomodate all of our Earth: 2025 players, Earth: 2025 offers three
different styles of Earth Servers for your pleasure.  Players are welcome to
play an account in each server.  Each is described below.

<P><FONT COLOR=#FFEECC><B><U>The Standard Server</U></B></FONT>
<DL><DD>The Standard Server offers our regular games.  Each player may manage
<I>one and only one</I> account on the Standard Server.  This server is split
into several games which each player may choose from: The Intensive Game
(Game A) offers the ability to play in teams (known as Clans) and should be
played mostly by experienced players.  Game B, the Standard Game, is for
those players who prefer play in a large group environement, but without
extensive teamwork.  In addition, there are 8 smaller, random games that are
designed for people interested in playing with a smaller group of people.

<P><FONT COLOR=#FFEECC><B><U>The Tournament Server</U></B></FONT>
<DL><DD>Like the Standard Server, players may manage <I>one and only one</I>
account on the Tournament server.  Tournament games are shorter -- one month
each -- and faster paced than the Standard games.  New players begin in
a random game at the lowest level of the tournament ladder.  Each round,
the best players will move up to a higher level game with tougher competition.
The top 5 players in the highest level game (Game A) each month will be
enshrined in the Hall of Champions.

<P><FONT COLOR=#FFEECC><B><U>Free for All Server</U></B></FONT>
<DL><DD>The Free For All server allows players to play <I>an unlimited
number of accounts</I> with relatively relaxed rules.  While turns accumulate
more slowly than the other servers, this game gives players the opportunity
to experiment with different strategies and get all the Earth gaming they
can handle.  Language and behavior rules still apply, however, and users are
expected to treat fellow players with proper respect.
