<H2><FONT COLOR=#FFEECC>The Story</FONT></H2>
The year is 2025.  A few years ago, the greatest war the Earth had ever known had
just come to an end.  All that remained were small pockets of life scattered
throughout the world.  No goverments.  No communications.  No organized
civilization.  Since then, you have banded together a small group of survivors
and put together a small country.  Where others saw chaos, you saw opportunity,
and now you want to be the leader of the most powerful country on the planet.
However, during this same time, thousands of others have done the same in their
area of the world and are now having the same thoughts in their heads.  Your
success will depend on mastery of every skill of rule -- economics, military
development, diplomacy, and more.  With an array of options and strategies at
your disposal, can you prove stronger, more cunning -- and most importantly,
smarter -- than all of your opponents?
<P>

<H2><FONT COLOR=#FFEECC>The Goal</FONT></H2>

<I>Earth</I> is an empire based game of strategy and thought.  As leader of a
newly founded country, your goal is to ultimately become supreme to all others.
Using everything from diplomacy to war, you must strive to build an empire both
economically and militarily superior to all others.  The ultimate aim?  To
become the most powerful country on the planet.
<P>
Through this all, you will compete against thousands of other players all
vying to achieve the same goals.  The only way you will succeed in achieving
greatness will be through working with others and convincing them to help you
get to where you want to be.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#FFEECC>The Format</FONT></H2>
<I>Earth</I> is built around a simple interface that is completely run over the
Web.  You will need a form-capable browser (such as Netscape or Internet
Explorer) to be able to play the game.  The instructions here are meant to be
only a simple guide -- the best (and only) way to really learn the game is to
experiment.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#FFEECC>Starting Out</FONT></H2>
First off, you will need to create a new player account.  You may maintain one
account on each of our major servers.  Each server has several different games
meant for different types of players to use -- you may join only one of these
games on each server.  Once you've created your account, enter the game and
you'll come to the main menu and be able to start your game.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#FFEECC>The Supreme Earth Authority</FONT></H2>
In order to facilitate the development of new countries and create some
semblance of order throughout the world, each of the countries on Earth has
come together and agreed to rules set for by the Supreme Earth Authority,
an international body similar to the former United Nations.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#FFEECC>The Main Menu</FONT></H2>
Each time you enter Earth: 2025, you'll be shown a basic status report, recent
news about your country, and the main menu from which you can access all
options within the game.  It is divided into a series of lesser menus as
listed below.  If you have not played before, it is highly recommended that
you view each of the menus to get a better feel for the game and what's
available to you.
<BR>

<TABLE WIDTH=600>
<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Purchasing</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>Two key components of survival for any country are a solid military and
plenty of food.  While both can be produced, the Supreme Earth Authority also
provides a market from which you can buy any of these items.  However, <I>this
market is limited in size</I>.  Each country has a certain amount of goods
available for purchase, and the SEA will slowly add more to your available
purchase supply.  The size of your market is dependent upon the total land in
your country.<P>You must always pay maintenance to keep your military in good
condition.  As your empire grows larger, it becomes more expensive to maintain
your army.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Construction</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>While land is vital for any country, it is far more useful when used
productively.  From here, you can build a variety of structures on your land
which will provide long-term benefits to your country.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Exploration</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>Land is a necessity for the growth of any country.  Your land can be used
to build on as well as to house people.  Note, however, that a large amount of
land with little defense will make you an attractive target to other countries.
This menu will let you spend time exploring for new lands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Research</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>As an alternative to pure expansion, making your current assets more
productive is always helpful.  Your research centers allow you to spend time
researching new technologies which allow you to become deceptively strong
without showing it publicly.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Generate Cash</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>Any country will face occasional cash shortages.  This option allows you to
use turns for the sole purpose of earning money.  It provides additional
revenues over normal turns, but at the same time produces little of long-term
value to a country.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Military Attacks</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>To become the best, you will eventually need to challenge others.  Peaceful
expansion will take you only so far, and you'll visit the war room to take on
potential future opponents.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Spy Operations</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>Instead of using brute force, you can also challenge other countries using
spies and terrorist activities.  Successful terrorism leaves no trace of who
attacked, but caught spies often can be easily identified.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Relations</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>Vital to success in the long run is working with others.  You can develop
various military, technology, intelligence, and trade agreements with other
countries from this menu.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Foreign Aid</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>In a variety of situations, you may find yourself in a position of needing
to send goods to another player  In the form of foreign aid, you can send a
small portion of your goods to players with whom you have formal alliances.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Public Market</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>To facilitate trade between countries, the Supreme Earth Authority has set
up a public market on which you can buy and sell a variety of goods.  This
market is often the cheapest way of making purchases and an excellent way to
profit on unneeded supplies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Country Status</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>This will give you more detailed information about the status of your country
than does the regular main menu.  You should return here occasionally to see the
growth of your country in detail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>News</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>The news search options here allow you to see recent happenings throughout
the world.  This will consist mostly of attacks, as well as any other
major occurrences affecting the players.  Because of the high volume of attacks
worldwide, you can narrow your search to only views news on countries in your
interests.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Send & Read<BR>Messages</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>Communicating with other players is, of course, vital to you ability to
compete and grow.  These options will allow you to send messages to others, as
well as read and reply to messages send by others.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Scores &<BR>Top Players</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>These option show you the top players of the land and your ranking
amongst all of the countries on Earth.  Hopefully, with solid management, each
time you check these options, your ranking will rise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Player Search</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>When selecting players to interact with, you will always have the option
of selecting from a list of players ranked near you and selecting by number.
To make this process easier, the Player Search option allows to you find
other players based on their number or name.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Country<BR>Management</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>How you want to run your country is up to you.  You can select from a
variety of different governmental regimes, each of which has its benefits and
drawbacks.  You can also control just how much of each type of military
unit your industrial complexes produce from this option.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Preferences</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>This menu allows you to control non-game-related options, such as your
password or other preference settings.  From here, you may also put your
country in vacation mode if you cannot play for several days.  While
protecting you from attack, you also cannot enter the game or gain any turns
during this time.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Delete Account</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>If you choose to no longer play Earth: 2025, you may delete your account
here.  You may also choose to simply leave your account inactive and it will
be eventually deleted.  For security reasons, in order to delete your account,
you will need to provide your real name as entered when initially creating your
country.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Logout</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>This option provides you a way of earning extra turns within Earth: 2025.
Since turns are the most precious commodity available with the game, taking
advantage of logging out will help you grow stronger much more quickly.</TD></TR>

<TR><TH COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR=#770000>Other Important Topics</TH></TR>

<TR>
<TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Turns</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL><I>Earth</I> is organized in a turn-based system.  Every hour, you will
receive additional turns.  However, at any one time, you cannot have more
than 75 turns, so it is recommended you play your turns often.  While some of
the options you choose will not consume any turns, several (such as attacking
or building on your land) will.  Each turn you take will also result in
you receiving additional tax revenues as well as your country naturally growing
or shrinking, depending on your economic situation.
<BR>
A Limited numberof turns above your maximum will be stored and then released
at a rate of one additional turn per hour.  However, there is also a maximum
on stored turns; once you surpass this limit, extra turns will simply disappear.
Therefore, it's important that you try to play at least once every day or two
to keep from falling behind.
<TR>
<TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Food</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>Each turn, your empty lands will be used as amateur farms to produce
small amounts of food.  Each turn, your people and military require basic
amounts of food and money to survive, so you will need to make efficient
use of your land and watch your food supplies to ensure there are no problems.
You will also find that a small portion of your food reserves will spoil each
turn, so a fresh store is always necessary.  A significant lack of food could
result in long-term damage to your economy and military effectiveness.
<TR>
<TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Oil</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>A vital resource for any country,
oil is necessary to make your Jets and Tanks function.  Oil may be produced
through Oil Rigs or bought on the Public Market, and is consumed by your
military when attacking.  Each barrel of Oil will support 10 Jets and/or Tanks
in any single attack.
<TR>
<TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Protection</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>In order to ensure that new players are not immediately killed off by larger,
dominant countries, you will be under protected status for your first 100 turns.
During this time, you may not attack or perform spy operations on other countries, and
others cannot perform these actions on you.
<TR>
<TH BGCOLOR=#000077>GDI</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>The GDI is an organized defense team in Earth: 2025 dedicated to protecting
countries from attacks by relatively huge or tiny enemies.  Any country
is free to join the GDI, but will be required to pay a tax each turn to
remain a member.  <B>In the Tournament, GDI is automatic and free to all members</B>.
<TR>
<TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Logging Out</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>To keep the server free for more players, we offer rewards for staying out
of the game for at least 12 or 18 hours.  By not logging in, you will receive
2 or 4 turns respectively, depending on how long you are logged out.
<TR>
<TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Networth</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>Networth is a combination of many factors within your empire and indicates
an overall level of strength.  The major contributing factor is military, but
also included is technology, people, land, and money.
<TR>
<TH BGCOLOR=#000077>Vacation Mode</TH>
<TD BGCOLOR=#444444><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE=ARIAL>If you know you will be unable to play Earth for several days, you can set
your country on vacation mode from the Change Settings menu.  While on
vacation, you receive no additional turns but are protected from attacks as well.
You also must remain on vacation mode for at least 72 hours.
