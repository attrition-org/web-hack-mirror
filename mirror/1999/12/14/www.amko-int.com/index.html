world time to do somthin before it gets out of hand&quot;</strong></font></p>

<p align="center">The future is in are hands, if we can not even
put aside the differnces that make us split and hate. What will
this be when you find out that your children don't belive in you
because of your ways of the past. The only way we can start over
is by remembering the past (this is key), but forgiving things
that where done so long ago will make it better. Because the
people you hate today are not the same and your byist attitude
that you bring does not show any sign of making you fell better.
We are tired of hearing that there is nothing we can do, even the
idea of peace and rightfull treatment in some places are unknown.
The twisting of young minds start at a young age ether by a
parent or an individual that infuences most actions the kids do.
As we aproch the year 2K I would like to see more things put
toward better family life and the cuting down of all the split
ups. How many kids have a the same mom or dad when they reach the
age of 15, at my school at lest 3/4 of the kids parents split up,
yet you still blame most actions by kids on Tv, movies, games or
what ever you can blame to take it off <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>you</strong></font>.
It may not seem like it but you have to have some life with your
kids even though most kids dont like there parents around, they
will respect you more in the end. </p>
