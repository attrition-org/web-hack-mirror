<p><b><font size=+1>Some of the Innovations Rodney has come up with are
really interesting ...for example he has his own shoveling invention which
he hooks onto his truck and then moves all the sand that has built up around
his shack.</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Another Innovation would be his Hot water System..it's
not your usual hot water system !!</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>There are many more Innovations but you will just have
to come along and see for yourself</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
