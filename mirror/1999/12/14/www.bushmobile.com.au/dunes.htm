<p>&nbsp;<b><font size=+1>The wind-blown sand dunes of Stockton Beach comprise
the largest continuous mobile sand mass in New South Wales. The yellow
grains have been washed in from the sea and blown ashore to form dunes
up to thirty metres high. Most of the sand was deposited about six thousand
years ago. Despite the stabilising effects of plants such as spinifex,
pigface and bitou bush, the wind-driven dunes move about four metres a
year. The side of a dune is steep and loosely packed, making a perfect
surface for sliding down on a sheet of cardboard or something more elaborate.</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Most plants that grow there have an edible part. Fresh
water can be collected from a hole dug anywhere in low ground between the
dunes.</font></b></center>
<b><font size=+1>Every hundred metres, piles of bleached white shells indicate
the site of an Aboriginal shell midden. These are the remains of meals
eaten by the people of the Woromi Tribe and contain the bones of mammals,
birds and lizards as well as theshells of molluscs and crustaceans.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
