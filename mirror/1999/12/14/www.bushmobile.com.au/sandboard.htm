<B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Have you ever been snow boarding??Well
it's basically snowboarding minus the snow, the cold and the really thick
clothing u have to wear ..just add sand dunes, casual summer clothing and
some sunscreen.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+2>When we sadnboard we ask you
to sit down on the <A HREF="sandboard1.htm">sandboard</A> instead of standing
...because if your not an experienced sanboarder you can cause your self
injury.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+2>So now we have a more toboggan
like ride which you may have experienced as a child out in the snow on
a sled.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Firstly we must wax the boards
to get the maximum speed allowed on the sandy surface ...we put the wax
on the bottom of the board because when both surfaces (sand and board surface)
are rubbed against each other it causes friction which melts the wax and
this allows the board to skid over the sand</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><IMG SRC="tobog.jpg" HEIGHT=254 WIDTH=333 ALIGN=RIGHT><B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+2>This
picture is a good example of tobogganing down the sand dunes face ...as
you can see he has complete control ovver the board using his hands to
guide the board as well as stop the board ....also incase you feel your
going to fast you can put your feet out for additional breaking power.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Generally we try going down
a good sized dune with a nice smooth trip down the bottom ...this section
of our tours is always popular because it's something you don't do very
often and it's also extremely fun !!</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Tobogganing is for all aged people
including those young at heart..if you would like more information on sandboarding
