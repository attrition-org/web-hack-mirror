<FONT COLOR="#990000"><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Basically Off Road means just that!!
It means off the normal Tar roads we are used to driving on....roads like
the free way, highway and just our normal suburb streets.&nbsp; Usually
the 4 Wheel Drive is used for these roads ....simply because they are 4
wheel driven meaning all 4 all of the wheels are driving the car, unlike
your usual car which is driven by the 2 rear wheels. The road varies allot
ranging from your dirt road to very dense bush.</B></FONT></FONT>

<BR><FONT COLOR="#990000"><FONT SIZE=+2><B>This picture is a good example
of dense bush, usually it is veryhandy to have a winch aboard just incase
the vehicle does get bogged. There are several competitive sports that
use diet tracks and difficult terrain sports like rally driving, motor
cross riding and cross dessert events. Almost all vehicles used to do offroad
driving are very powerful machines, the BUSHMOBILE is just one of them!.
The Bushmobile is known for it's ability to go places where most buses
can't go as well as 4 Wheel Driven Vehicles. Not to mention the BUSHMOBILE
is actually 6 Wheel Drive which alone not only sounds impressive but also
is very impressive. The Sand Dune Tours and adventures are a great example
of offroad driving. The sand not being as solid as say your bitchimin or
Dirt road is very loose and take approximately twice as much power as the
vehicle would normally use on your normal suburban street, this sort of
terrain is very treacherous but if handled correctly can be one of the
most exciting driving surfaces to actually drive on, The driver must always
be in control and know exactly what he/she is doing, Just the slightest
miss judgment can cause the vehicle to become bogged meaning it can't go
anywhere. The mistake most non experienced drivers make is continue to
excellerate and try and go out forward ..this usually results in the driver
digging his/her vehicle in more than at the beginning making it nearly
impossible to get out. The trick to avoiding this is to recognise exactly
when your vehicle can go no further and stop immediately and reverse out.
Another trick to avoiding such accurances is to let your tires down to
about half the tire pressure ...this allows your 4wd to get more traction
on the surface by increasing the surface area of the tire allowing more
grip.</B></FONT></FONT>
