<p><b><font size=+1>On our longer tours we carry extra equipment such as
tents, sleeping bags, luggage, food and as well as our own storage of water
which is vital for the desert trips. As well as the equipment described
we also have to carry told and spare parts incase of a break down as well
as shovels etc to dig ourselves out of bogged situations.</font></b>
