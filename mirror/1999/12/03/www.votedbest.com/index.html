Big ballin, hackin', makin my ends<br>
Smokin big killa gettin high in the Benz<br>
In the wind smoke goes as I crawl down on Vogues<br>
Twenty Lorenzo, smoke all up in my nose <br>
Yo' eyes, get froze, as you see my low <br>
Candy-red, two-door, let my top down slow<br>
Hittin, my remote, sittin, in my shit<br>
Presidential V-12 with that AMG kit<br>
It don't quit, as I get high from K.C. to H-Town, connectin
SouthSide<br>
Now we worldwide, watch me highside<br>
Uneek Tech blowin killa, can't be denied<br>
187 thugs, oh yeah we got love<br>
Blowin sticky green we flow through and above</p>

<pre>Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.
My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think,
not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you,
something that you will never forgive me for.
I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.
You may stop this individual,
but you can't stop us all... after all,
we're all alike.
