	How dare you think I was gone?@# How dare you!@!#$ I'm ashamed.. I leave for like,
	4 months, and all you kids shit your pants.. you think I got caught? Hah! I'm not
	like that, it aint my bag baby. *Sigh* It's good to be back boys and girls, and I
	hope you haven't forgotten me, because I haven't forgotten you. This doesn't exactly
	have a meaning, which isn't really what I'm about, but give me a break, it's been 4
	months! I needed to, like an addict getting a hit of heroin.

	Well, there isn't much else to say. I am back. I was here, and now I'm gone, I leave
	my tag and carry on. Have a good one, glad to be back.

		To the admin, move devil.htm to index.htm and you're all set, not 100 000
		dollars worth of damage so don't complain, you were hit by one of the
		whitest-of-white hackers. If you want help with anything, e-mail me. I've
		proven my point, no need to do it again.
