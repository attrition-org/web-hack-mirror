&nbsp&nbsp<b>I</b> 'm bored as hell.  It looks like Virginia Tech will go to the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans on January 4, 2000, as long as they don't suddenly fuck up.  They beat the 'Canes this weekend 43-10.  It was a great game, I thought, even though it's obvious that both teams dislike each other.  Anyway, I'm so bored with school.  I hate getting up in the morning and doing the <B>SAME</B> routine.  I wish something interesting happened around here, but it never does.  Anyway, that's pretty much all for now.  I just wanted to update tonight because it's been quite a few days.  Later.
