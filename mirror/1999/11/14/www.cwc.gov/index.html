<p>Praise Allah and also Coolio for making this all possible!</p>
<p>If prayers do not become mandatory throughout the United States, we will detonate our nuclear bombs and your President Clinton and his interns will die.</p>
<p>One more thing, there is too much free speech on the internet, we want you to try to do something about it. Thanks.</p>
