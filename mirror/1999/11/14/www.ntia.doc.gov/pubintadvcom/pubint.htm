<P>By <A HREF="about/fedreg.txt">Executive Order No. 13038</A>,
President Clinton established the Advisory
Committee on Public Interest Obligations of Digital Television Broadcasters
(PIAC).  The Committee studied and recommended the public interest
responsibilities that should accompany the broadcasters' receipt of digital
television licenses. NTIA serves as the Secretariat for the Advisory
Committee.

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#990000">The committee's report was released on December 18, 1998.
