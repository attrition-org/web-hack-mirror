Because NTIA serves as the Executive Branch's principle voice on
telecommunications and information technology policy issues in
numerous international fora, NTIA's international activities
cover a broad range.  These fora include:</P>

<H3>How Are International Telecommunications and Information
Technology Policies Made?</H3>
<FONT=-2>
<P>International telecommunications and information policies are
developed on three separate levels:

<P>--the country level through the Ministries of
telecommunications and/or information; 
<P>--the regional level through organizations such as the
European Union (EU), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC
represents 18 Asia-Pacific economies), and the Inter-American
Telecommunications Commission (CITEL is an entity of the    Organization of American States designed to facilitate and
further the development of telecommunications in the region); and
<P>--the multilateral level through entities such as the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU--the international
telecommunications regulatory and standard setting body),   INTELSAT/Inmarsat (multilateral treaty-based governmental
organizations providing global satellite communications), the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and
the World Trade Organization (WTO).

<P>  At the country level, the Ministry of telecommunications is
frequently both the national regulator and the telecommunications
policy maker.  As a result, the Ministry is responsible for
regulating the telecommunications industry--determining the rules
of the market, the number of entrants, and the range of services
that can be offered to the public.  In addition, the Ministry has
been typically the monopoly owner of the telecommunications
provider of local, long-distance, and international service.  The
main thrust of U.S. telecommunications policy is to urge
government officials to privatize their government monopolies and
open them to competition -- including of course, competition from
American companies.

<P>  At the regional level, organizations such as the EU, APEC,
and CITEL bring together the telecommunications policy officials
from countries in the region.  Together, they coordinate and
formulate joint telecommunications and information policies and
practices.  There is a growing trend among these organizations to
include the voice of the private sector, to gain from their
experiences.

<P>  At the multilateral level, organizations such as the ITU,
OECD, WTO, INTELSAT and Inmarsat bring together countries around
the world to coordinate and formulate global telecommunications
and information policies and practices.</P>

<H3>Examples of NTIA Office of International Affairs (OIA)
Initiatives:</H3>

<H4><P><LI>Achieving Global Consensus on the Future of
Telecommunications</H4>

<H5><P>* Through Multilateral, Regional, and Bilateral
Initiatives</H5>
<FONT=0><P>** Global Information Infrastructure (GII)--In the <A
HREF="http://www.iitf.nist.gov/documents/docs/gii/giiagend.html">GLOBAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE: AGENDA FOR COOPERATION</A>,
OIA developed and launched the Administration's detailed Action
Plan for developing the GII in the 21st century.  The Action Plan
provides a strategic framework for developing procompetitive
policies and practices.

<P>  The U.S. GII principles and Action Plan have galvanized the
international telecommunications community into formulating their
own GII plans and principles.  In early 1995, for example, the G-
7, APEC, and Latin American countries adopted the core GII
principles the United States advocates, and they are now
implementing policies to foster the development of a GII. 
Although a nascent GII already exists, what we seek is a superior
GII, one that has higher capacity, is fully interactive, faster,
and more versatile.  In addition, we want a GII that is less
expensive to use than existing systems and more accessible to all
the people of the world. 

<P> We are laying the policy groundwork for the GII at multiple
decision making levels, in every geographic region and through
many international organizations by building a consensus around
our core principles.  The United States has been successful in
using this GII vision as a platform to engage foreign governments
in discussions about the direction and content of their
telecommunications and information policies and practices.  By
achieving global consensus on what telecommunications networks
should look like and what the ground rules should be, the United
States is better equipped to fight for specific changes in
national and international telecommunications and information
practices that will make it easier for U.S. companies to compete
internationally.</P>

<P>** Global Electronic Commerce--A natural follow-on to OIA's
GII activities is our growing participation in the
Administration's efforts to promote Global Electronic Commerce. 
Secretary Daley has made promotion of electronic commerce a
Departmental priority, with its potential to greatly improve U.S.
jobs creation and new market development for U.S. industry.  The
growing use of the Internet for electronic commerce mean the
Administration will need to focus on appropriate policy and
regulatory regimes, both domestically and internationally.  The
Administration's July 1997 report,<A
HREF="http://www.iitf.nist.gov/eleccomm/ecomm.htm">A Framework
for Global Electronic Commerce</A>, will act as a blueprint for
our endeavors.

<P><H5>* Through Multilateral Initiatives</H5>

<P>** Frequency Allocation For Fixed And Mobile Satellites--The
biennial meeting of the <A HREF="http://www.itu.int">
International Telecommunication Union's (ITU)</A>
World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC) is responsible for
allocating global spectrum.  (Link to <A
HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov./osmhome/wrc97.html">U.S.
preparatory documents</A>) 

<P>NTIA, together with the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov">FCC</A>
and the <A HREF="http://www.state.gov">State Department</A>,will
seek allocations that will advance the GII, along with
U.S.commercial interests in the United States and overseas
markets. Given its mandate as manager of Federal spectrum, NTIA
will continue to play a strong leadership role in WRC
proceedings.  

<P>** Satellite Service Competition-- OIA is a strong advocate
for global competition in the satellite communications sector. 
Traditionally this sector has been dominated by international
cooperatives--<A HREF="http://www.intelsat.int">INTELSAT</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.inmarsat.org"> Inmarsat</A>--both of which
are currently considering options for restructuring.  In part,
because these organizations include a large number of state-owned
operating companies, they are hesitant to allow a fully
competitive marketplace.  The United States continues to push for
restructuring efforts that promote competition and deflect
attempts to undermine U.S. objectives.

<P><H5>* Through Regional Initiatives</H5>
<FONT=0>
<P>** Latin American and Southeast Asian Telecommunications
Summits--For several years OIA, in conjunction with the
Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), has undertaken a
series of regional policy and technology discussions designed to
give American companies the opportunity to meet with
telecommunications Ministers and their principal staff. 
Typically, such meetings are structured around a series of
bilateral policy discussions between the Minister and the
Assistant Secretary of NTIA.  Former Secretary Brown led two such
conferences.

<P>Each conference is also attended by approximately 25 U.S.
telecommunications equipment and service providers who have a
unique opportunity to demonstrate their technologies. Corporate
participation is managed through the TIA although TIA membership
is not a requirement of participation.  Although OIA does not
gather specific information on sales made during such meetings,
two firms participating in the first Latin American conference
reported sales in excess of $75 million.  There have been three
very successful conferences in Latin America, four in Southeast
Asia; current plans call for a fourth conference in Latin America
and a first conference in China, led by Secretary Daley.

<P>By joining forces with industry, the United States is able to
make a powerful case supporting the need for and advantages of
procompetitive telecommunications and information technology
policies.  At the same time, U.S. industry is given direct access
to these high-level decision makers, enabling them to make
valuable contacts and complete a number of business deals.

<P>** Other Regional Fora--OIA stays active within the key
regional telecommunications organizations in which the United
States can participate.  OIA is an active member of the <A
HREF="http://www.oas.org/SP/PROG/CITEL/citel.htm">CITEL</A>
organization, promoting telecommunications and information policy
reform throughout Latin America.  As well, OIA actively
participates in the <A HREF="http://www.apec-wg.com">APEC's</A>
efforts to create an Asia Pacific Information Infrastructure
while promoting liberalization and reform throughout the
Asian/Pacific/North & South American APEC region.  OIA is the key
organizational force behind the <A
HREF="http://www.gov/rtr/">Southern Africa Regional
Telecommunications Restructuring Program (RTRP)</A>, with an OIA
staff member on detail in Botswana to administer our regional
program objectives.  OIA also actively participates in the <A
HREF="http://www.oecd.fr/dsti/sti_ict.html">OECD's</A> efforts to
promote a Global Information Society and the benefits of an open
policy regime for the Internet.

<P><H5>* Through Bilateral Initiatives</H5>
<FONT=0>
<P>** Bilateral policy discussions--OIA participates in
regularly-scheduled high-level telecommunications and information
policy discussions with Russia, Mexico, Canada, China, Germany,
France, United Kingdom, and the European Union.  These
discussions provide a unique opportunity to exchange views on
both broad and narrow policy issues.  Today many discussions
focus on the structures and procedures needed for broad-scale
liberalization.  Earlier discussions provided the forum to begin
introduction of international value-added networks (IVANS) which,
in turn, often provided the impetus for initial liberalization. 

<P>In the past few years, the Administration has signed bilateral
Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) of the GII with Russia,
Argentina, and Chile.  These MOUs highlight the intention of
these nations to cooperate to realize the vision of the GII.  In
addition to these MOUs, NTIA has signed an agreement with the
Chinese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to cooperate in
the fields of science and technology. This cooperative effort
provides us with the opportunity to advance the merits and
applicability of U.S. technology.

<P>In addition, the Administration has completed the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico for
enhanced telecommunications services and are now discussing
expansion of NAFTA.  The Administration also has completed
international value-added network services (IVANS) agreements
with several countries including: Japan, Hong Kong, Korea,
France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands.

<P>** Section 1377, 1988 Trade Act -- OIA also provides policy
and technical expertise to the annual interagency review of the
Telecommunications Trade Act of 1988.  Under Section 1377 of this
Act, the U.S. Government must decide if Canada, Mexico, Japan,
Korea, and Taiwan are in compliance with agreements signed with
the United States.  Because OIA was actively involved in the
negotiation of the relevant agreements, we continue to monitor
compliance and work with companies to help resolve any issues
that arise regarding their interpretation.

<P>** World Trade Organization -- OIA was an integral part of the
U.S. telecommunications negotiating team for the GATT
organization's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)
providing valuable technical expertise.  In late 1993, the United
States reached a world-wide agreement on opening value-added
telecommunications services markets around the world. OIA/NTIA
also served on the negotiating team for the renamed World Trade
Organization's Group on Basic Telecommunications agreement
negotiations(GBT). Through the GBT, the United States is seeking
to extend market access commitments to the basic
telecommunications sector (e.g., voice telephone services).  In
April 1997, 69 nations agreed to grant <A
Href="Http://www.wto.org/new/gbtoff.htm">(Country Offers)</A>
market access to each other for basic telecommunications
services.
