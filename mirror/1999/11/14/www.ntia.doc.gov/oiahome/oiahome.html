<P>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration,
NTIA, is the Executive Branch's principal voice on domestic and
international telecommunications and information technology policy
issues.  NTIA's Office of International Affairs, <A
HREF="staffoia.htm">OIA</A>, acts as an
advocate of U.S. commercial interests overseas.  OIA promotes the
need for competition and liberalization of telecommunications and
information policies around the world.  
     OIA's goal is to provide policy analyses, technical guidance, and representation
in international fora, so as to advance the strategic interests
and the international competitiveness of the United States before 
a diverse, world-wide audience.
<P>     OIA's wide variety of <A
HREF="internat.html">activities</A> are designed to further 
advance and promote these U.S. interests by advocating:  1)
telecommunications and information standards consistent with U.S.
objectives; 2) regulations governing the international use of the
radio frequency spectrum; 3) regulatory policies pertaining to
the provision of information and telecommunications services both
within and between U.S. and foreign markets; and, 4) the
deployment of new technologies in these markets, to improve
global communications and expand trade opportunities for our
citizens.  
<P>     OIA advocates Executive Branch policy perspectives in
bilateral and multilateral consultations with foreign
governments, in international regulatory conferences, and in other fora
dealing with <A HREF="http://www.iitf.nist.gov/documents/docs/gii/giiagend.html">Global
Information Infrastructure issues</A>. Specific oversight responsibilities include, in cooperation
with the <A HREF="http://www.state.gov/index.html">State Department</A> and with the <A
HREF="http://www.fcc.gov">FCC</A>, the <A HREF="http://www.comsat.com">COMSAT
Corporation's</A>  activities in the
<A HREF="http://www.intelsat.int">International Telecommunications Satellite
Organization</A> (INTELSAT) and the <A HREF="http://www.inmarsat.org">International
Mobile Satellite Organization</A> (Inmarsat), along with other developments in the <A
HREF="satellite.htm">satellite industry</A>.

 <P>    To improve U.S. competitiveness in international markets,
OIA provides policy and technical counsel to diverse U.S.
interests.   OIA helps NTIA in its mission to champion greater
foreign market access, by: 1) advocating competition and
liberalization of telecommunications and information technology
policies around the world; 2) participating in international
government-to-government negotiations to open markets for U.S.
companies; and 3) negotiating with foreign governments to ensure that
there is adequate spectrum for national defense, public safety,
and U.S. business needs.  OIA also provides information to the general public on a wide variety
of  <A HREF="dianelist.html"> telecommunications and
information policy subjects,</A> with links to foreign telecommunications ministries and
licensing authorities.
