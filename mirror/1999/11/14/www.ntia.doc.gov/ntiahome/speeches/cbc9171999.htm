<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Good afternoon. I'd like to thank Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson
and Texas Instruments for inviting me here today to join the Congressional
Black Caucus (CBC) Science and Technology braintrust. For those of you
who don't know, this is one of my last speaking opportunities as the Assistant
Secretary for Communications and Information, and I could think of no better
event for my departure speech than the CBC braintrust.
<p>As most of you know, I have spent much of my six-year tenure working
with the Administration examining opportunities in information and communication
sectors, and making sure that those opportunities are available to all
members of our society. There is no doubt that the last few years have
shown us the promise of the next century. Our economic growth has been
spurred by the stunning development of the high-tech sector and Internet
commerce, which have created tremendous new opportunities and new jobs.
These opportunities promise only to grow in the next century.
<p>Our goal now, as Federal officials, legislators, and community activists,
is to ensure that these opportunities and jobs are available to people
of all races, all ages, and all areas, so that our "new economy" is truly
an inclusive economy. And the CBC has been, and can continue to be, at
the forefront of those efforts.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>The Growth of New Media</i></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And what do we mean by the "new economy"?
The economy of the next century will be a digital economy, spurred by the
growth of information technologies and electronic commerce. Already, approximately
</font>one-third of this nation's economic growth in the past few years
(or over $1.1 trillion) has come from information technologies, according
to a recent Department of Commerce report. It is an economy fueled by unparalleled
investment. For example, just this year, $8 billion in ventured funding
has poured into Internet companies; that's twice last year's rate [USA
Today, 9/17/99].
<p>The most stunning example of high-tech growth is the surge in electronic
commerce (or e-commerce). According to a recent University of Texas study,<font face="Times New Roman">
e-commerce is growing at a far faster rate than anticipated. The Internet
economy generated more than $300 billion in revenue and was responsible
for 1.2 million jobs in 1998. In several years, revenues are expected to
well exceed $1 trillion.</font>
<p>The opportunities created by the new economy are tremendous. <font face="Times New Roman">As
Vice President Gore declared, "In this emerging digital marketplace, anyone
with a good idea and a little software can set up shop, and become the
corner store for the entire planet."</font> You can be 18 or 81 and run
a store online. And because the Internet is color-blind, it is opening
up new commercial opportunities for<font face="Times New Roman"> people
of color. No one knows if the owner of an on-line store is an African American,
a Hispanic, an Asian American or a Native American.</font>
<p>The creation of new jobs in the high-tech sector are opening up other
doors as well. In 1997, IT-producing industries added 350,000 jobs, an
increase more than double the employment growth in other sectors. And the
opportunities in this sector are only expected to grow. More than 80% of
the nation's technology companies expect to increase their information
technology (IT) staff in the next several years. The Department of Commerce
recently reported that, by 2006, almost <i>half</i> of American workers
will be employed by industries that are either major information technology
producers or users of technology. And these are jobs that pay well: more
78% more than the average job ($52,920 compared to $29,787).
<p><b><i>The Implications of the Technology Gap</i></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">These opportunities are there, but they're
there only for those who are computer-literate and can participate in the
new economy. Unfortunately, what we have today is a society where not everyone
can participate in the new digital age. We now have a nation divided between
technology "haves" (those who have access to new technologies and understand
how they work), and a nation of technology "have nots." This has the potential
to aggravate economic divisions that already exist in America. If we want
the economy to flourish and our society to grow, we cannot continue to
exclude whole segments of America from the Information Revolution.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA recently illustrated the problem of
the "digital divide" in a <a href="../digitaldivide/index.html">report
released in July</a>. In that report, we found that there are extreme disparities
in access to new technologies based on income, education, geography, and
race. For example, </font>if you are Black or Hispanic, your chance of
having Internet access at home is less than one in ten. More than one-quarter
of Whites, by contrast, have home Internet access. To put it another way,
Blacks and Hispanics have significantly less access to the Internet from
any location (including work, home, or school) than Whites do just at home.
<p>The disparities between races are significant, and they are growing.
Between 1997 and 1998, the gap in household access to the Internet between
Blacks and Whites, and Hispanics and Whites, grew approximately five percentage
points (by almost 40%). Over the last four years, the gaps in computer
ownership have also grown approximately 40%.
<p>This technology gap exists across all facets of life. Last weekend,
for example, Jesse Jackson took 3 busloads of high school kids from a predominantly
African-American school on Chicago's South Side to a state-of-the-art school
in the wealthy suburb of Naperville. This visit was an eye-opener for these
kids: from a school with peeling paint and a computer room without Internet
connections, they saw a suburban facility with elaborate computer centers,
Olympic-sized swimming pools, and new science laboratories and music rooms.
Obviously, the kids in the South Side are not going to be acquiring the
same computer skills, or have the same access to information, as the kids
in Naperville.
<p>These discrepancies exist, not only at schools, but also at the college
level. For example, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs)
still are not using computers at the same level as other universities.
Four out of five students at elite private universities say they use computers
regularly. Only <i>two of five</i> students at HBCUs have reported that
to be the case.
<p>The technology gap among Americans can have a real impact when you're
looking at the job market. In fact, a recent study of 250 high-tech businesses
in Silicon Valley found that minorities were significantly underrepresented,
especially in managerial and professional positions. The study found that,
even though African-Americans represent 8 percent of the regions labor
force, they represent less than 4 percent of the workers in high-tech,
and less than 3 percent of managers and professionals. Similarly, while
Hispanics represent 14 percent of the regional workforce, they compose
only 5 percent of professionals and 3 percent of managers.
<p>The low rate of minority participation is particularly troubling when
many of the jobs in the high-tech industry are still unfilled. Nationwide,
more than 10% of the information technology jobs (or 346,000) positions
remain open because, companies claim, they are not able to find skilled
workers.
<p>The U.S. Congress has responded to this worker shortage by lifting the
cap on the number of foreign workers that can be imported to fill these
jobs. This will enable high-tech companies, over the next few years, to
employ nearly double the number of foreign computer programmers than is
currently allowed. But I hope and believe that this legislation is a short-term,
stopgap measure. What we really need to focus on is ensuring that our citizens
have the training to hold these jobs. Our long-term priority should not
be <i>importing</i> skilled workers, but <i>imparting</i> work skills to
our communities.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Opening Opportunities to All Americans</i></b>
<p>So what can we do to make sure that new media developments in the next
century provide real opportunities for <i>all</i> Americans? We need to
be sure that minorities gain access to new technologies, and training in
those technologies, both of which are necessary for jobs in the high-tech
sector.
<p>I have suggested a three-pronged approach: we need to increase "connectivity,"
raise "receptivity," and heighten "activity" in these sectors. That is,
we need to connect more schools and communities; we need to inspire our
communities to explore opportunities in the new media; and we need to provide
the minority community tools to take advantage of these opportunities.
<p>First, "<b><i>connectivity</i></b>." One of our primary tasks is to
connect the schools in our minority areas. The Clinton Administration has
long supported the "<font face="Times New Roman">education-rate" or "e-rate"
program, which provides a discounted rate to schools and libraries that
are purchasing telecommunications services, Internet access, and classroom
connections. This program will help more inner city schools, and underserved
areas, get online. Already we have made significant strides: almost 90%
of all schools have some kind of Internet connection, but those schools
without Internet access are far more likely to be found in low-income and
minority neighborhoods.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Connecting our communities will also take
a broader array of efforts. Not everyone has access to a school or library,
or wants to spend time in a school or library to get information. We need
to reach out to communities through additional facilities, such as community
centers, churches, Boys and Girls Clubs, or 4H Clubs. The Congressional
Black Caucus should be proud to be one of the most active advocates in
this effort. Thanks to Congresswoman Maxine Waters' efforts, the Department
of Education is now running a program to fund community technology centers
around the country.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA also administers a program, called
the <a href="../../otiahome/tiiap/index.html">Telecommunications
and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP)</a>, which brings
new technologies to underserved communities. TIIAP has funded projects
that provide access to electronic job databases, provide computer training
for the community, or help retrain adults in lifelong skills.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Industry efforts are also bringing more
people online. Last month, Secretary Daley helped announce the opening
of a new community technology training center in Southeast Washington.
The center has come about through the work of a public/private partnership
between the Greater Washington Urban League, AT&amp;T, and Microsoft. This
is just one of the many examples of corporate efforts to connect underserved
communities.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">But we need to make sure that more companies
get involved and coordinate their activities. Toward that end, Secretary
Daley announced that he will be holding a national roundtable to examine
ways to close the digital divide. As he has explained, we need a serious
dialogue on ways to bring technology to underserved communities. And that
dialogue should include major technology companies, civil rights organizations,
civic leaders, and community groups.</font>
<p>We also need to work on "<b><i>receptivity</i></b>;" that is, we need
to inspire the minority community to explore opportunities in the telecom
and new media sectors. Most kids today would rather grow up to be Michael
Jordan than Michael Dell, and spend time on a basketball court than in
a computer room. We need to teach them that the chances of fame and fortune
are far greater in the telecom and high-tech fields than on the playing
field.
<p>We also need to challenge our companies to do more for our youth. Companies
should be thinking about how to reach out to the young and minority markets.
Take the Visor, for example. This new personal digital assistant is like
a Palm Pilot but can transform into a wireless phone, a fax modem, a digital
camera, or a MP3 music player simply by snapping on the right module. Because
it comes in trendy flourescent colors, it is particularly likely to attract
youth.
<p>Examples like this can teach our kids that technology is not just for
geeks, but can be cool information tools.
<p>Finally, we need more "<b><i>activity</i></b>" to open doors to the
minority community, whether you're looking for a job or starting your own
business. The opportunities are there; we just need to be make sure that
they're universally available.
<p>One component of this effort is training. We need to make sure that
training in high-tech skills is available, not only for K-12 students,
but from K through retirement. We all need access to training to develop
new skills, or refresh old ones, in today's changing job market. That's
why the Administration announced a plan earlier this year for lifelong
skills training that will help companies address the skills gap.
<p>We also need to make sure that minority and small businesses are significant
players in this commercial development. Minorities have long been consumers
of communications services, whether it be cable, television, or wireless
devices. Now, we need to shift our focus so that we become the providers.
We need to be the entrepreneurs, the creators of content, and the ones
to provide the tools for telecommunications services. We should not only
be thinking about using software and hardware, but manufacturing them.
We should not only be viewing video streaming services, but marketing them.
And we should not only be buying goods online, but creating new niche markets
in the Web marketplace. Only then will we ensure that all Americans are
truly benefitting from the new economy.
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<p>The next century promises a digital economy that is profitable and dynamic.
And it is worth all our efforts to ensure that every American can participate
in the digital world. <font face="Times New Roman">Author William Gibson
has been quoted as saying that "the future has arrived; it's just not evenly
distributed."</font> As we move into the digital world, we cannot afford
to let technological literacy become unevenly distributed. We cannot afford
to become a nation divided between "information haves" and "information
have nots." CBC is one of the alliances that can prevent that result, and
I look forward to working with you in that campaign.
