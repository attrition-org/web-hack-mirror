<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is the
Executive Branch agency principally responsible for domestic and international
telecommunications and information policy issues.  With roughly $70 million
available for 1997 activities, NTIA's workforce of approximately 286 full-time
equivalent (FTE) employees works to promote the efficient and effective use of
telecommunications and information resources in a manner that creates job
opportunities, enhances U.S. competitiveness, and raises the standard of living.
NTIA is physically located in the Herbert C. Hoover Building at 1401 Constitution
Avenue, Washington, DC 20230 and its laboratory -- the Institute for
Telecommunication Sciences -- is located in the Commerce Laboratory Complex at
325 South Broadway, Boulder, CO 80303.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is the
President's principal adviser on telecommunications and information policy issues
and, in this role, frequently works with other Executive Branch agencies to develop
and present the Administration's position on these issues.  In addition to
representing the Executive Branch in both domestic and international
telecommunications and information policy activities, NTIA also manages the
Federal use of the spectrum; administers infrastructure grants to support the
development of a national information infrastructure accessible to all Americans;
manages public telecommunications facilities grants designed to maintain and
extend the public broadcasting infrastructure; and performs cutting-edge
telecommunications research and engineering, including resolving technical
telecommunications issues for the Federal government and private&nbsp;sector.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">NTIA is unique among Federal government agencies in that everything the agency
does is focused exclusively on telecommunications and information.  The expertise
of the agency extends to every aspect of telecommunications, including community
network applications, domestic policy, international policy, spectrum management,
and telecommunications research and engineering.  Within the resources available
to the agency, NTIA addresses the highest priority issues in telecommunications
and information today and maximizes the return on those resources by utilizing this
expertise throughout its programs.  Our analysts bring not only an appreciation of
the complexities of developing national policies, but they also draw on technical
expertise to understand how those policies will facilitate or hinder development and
application expertise to gauge the impact on communities and individuals.  This
internal synergy is critical to NTIA's credibility and respect in the community; the
agency's power of influence and ability to successfully advocate positions is a
direct result of this synergy.<STRONG></STRONG></FONT></P>




<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular"><STRONG><EM>Telecommunications and Information Environment.</EM></STRONG></FONT><FONT FACE="Univers Regular"></FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">The telecommunications and information revolution is bringing dramatic growth and
change to the nation's economic, social, and political life.  These exciting
developments affect every American to some extent because nearly everyone uses
telephones, televisions, computers, radio, and related technology.  Citizens receive
public services and protections that rely upon telecommunications technology.  
Communication is fundamental to the very organization of society and to life as it is
lived today.  Affordable access to telecommunications technology is becoming a
basic necessity for a successful and productive life in all sectors of our society,
including business, academia, industry, banking and government.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">The rapid growth and critical importance of the telecommunications and information
industries will continue for at least the next decade, domestically and
internationally.  The following charts --<EM>An Overview of Industry Growth </EM>and <EM>The 
Global Telecom Industry </EM>--attest to the industry's growth and its impact on our
future.</FONT></P>

and for tomorrow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular"><img src="../icon/larry3.gif" width="457" height="325" align=right ></FONT></P>




<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">Globally the industry is
positioned for continuing
growth.  Any indicator
associated with
telecommunications and
information provides a similar
growth projection for the
future.  </FONT></P>





<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">Over the next decade, new equipment and services will be deployed and purchased 
on a scale that is unprecedented.  The pace of commerce is expected to accelerate
as the global community seeks to participate in the new business opportunities and
advantages made possible by the evolving global information infrastructure.  </FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">Viewing the impact of these technologies solely through an economic prism,
however, may not provide a full picture of the magnitude of change on individuals, 
society, and international affairs.  Some of these changes can be extrapolated from
existing trends, while others promise to astonish even the experts.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular"><STRONG><EM>Present and Future Issues</EM></STRONG></FONT><FONT FACE="Univers Regular"><EM></EM></FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">The increasing convergence of telecommunications and information technologies
produces novel combinations that challenge accurate prediction.  As the telephone
network increasingly is used to transmit data and the television provides viewers
access to the World Wide Web, varied and unique combinations of previously
discrete technologies are being created.   The convergence of technologies also
means the blurring of industry boundaries -- previously clearly defined industries
that have been regulated by disparate authorities  -- and the convergence of service
offerings.  The impact of this convergence on regulatory issues challenges old
sensibilities and institutions.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">The issues for today and tomorrow require NTIA to provide expertise-based
leadership and a visionary view of what lies ahead in telecommunications and
information.  Ideas matter and NTIA's experts will continue to be at the leading
edge of policy analysis regarding ideas and issues confronting and shaping the
telecommunications and information sectors today and for the future.  A sampling
of these issues includes:</FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">	As the diffusion of new technologies into the marketplace accelerates, the
need to effectively and efficiently manage spectrum -- a precious, finite
resource -- is critical.  Although NTIA represents the Federal users of the
spectrum and must ensure spectrum is available to enable Federal missions 
-- including air traffic control and national defense -- to be accomplished, the
scarcity of this resource requires NTIA to function as an honest broker on
behalf of the public interest, working constructively and cooperatively with
the private sector and government spectrum users.  At the same time, NTIA
is uniquely positioned and has the expertise necessary to formulate a
spectrum management vision for the future and policies for today that
encompass the entire range of spectrum applications and users. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">	Many wired telecommunications services will be augmented by additional 
wireless services; the accompanying escalating demands for spectrum in turn
demand increasingly efficient and effective management of this finite
resource.  Wired and wireless solutions will coexist, creating unprecedented
options for individuals and organizations.  These transformations not only will
require rapid policy response, but also clear-eyed analysis and forecasts.  As
an example, Personal Communications Services (PCS) are gaining
momentum, establishing communications available anytime and anywhere for
many Americans.  These new services are accompanied by new issues that
will need to be addressed, including competition and universal service,
privacy and security issues.  Continued growth of wireless services requires
technological and administrative advances in spectrum management.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">	The push to connect schools, libraries, and other community access centers
to electronic information sources continues.  NTIA today is helping to design 
models to ensure fulfillment of our national commitment to universal service,
which now is defined to also ensure that schools, libraries, and other public
institutions are connected to the emerging telecommunications infrastructure. 
NTIA in the future will contribute to assessments of how well universal
service is working, how to ensure that public institutions are current with
technology, how technologies are used in public institutions, and whether 
and how universal service should be redefined.  </FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">	In the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on basic
telecommunications services entered in March 1997, almost 70 countries,
representing approximately 95% of the world's telecommunications
revenues, have agreed to liberalize their telecommunications markets.  NTIA
will work with our colleagues to ensure that the signatories understand the
regulatory principles and enforcement mechanisms needed to make
liberalization happen in their countries and assist them to the maximum
extent possible with implementation of the WTO Agreement.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">	The FCC is requiring television broadcasters to convert to digital technology 
by 2006 (although there may be an extension determined by consumer
preferences).  NTIA will contribute to the debate on the appropriate public
interest obligations of digital broadcasters.  The President recently
established an advisory committee to provide recommendations to the Vice
President on this issue; NTIA is charged with programmatically and
administratively supporting this Committee.    </FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">	In addition, public broadcasters alone will require at least $1 billion to cover
their conversion to digital.  The survival of public broadcasting in light of this
conversion is not guaranteed; this issue could be prominent throughout the
next decade.  Through its Public Telecommunications Facilities Program
(PTFP), NTIA has developed significant expertise and on-going relationships
with the public broadcasting community and is uniquely qualified to
contribute to the debate on public broadcasting's conversion to digital.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">	Electronic commerce will proliferate over the next five years, creating and
expanding business opportunities globally.  NTIA will support a predictable,
minimalist, consistent and simple legal environment that will facilitate the
growth of electronic commerce, and help resolve privacy, content regulation,
copyright protection, taxation, and other similar issues.  Market access and
infrastructure issues will become more pronounced, accompanied by public
impatience for rapid resolution so that commerce will not be impeded.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">	Public safety and law enforcement increasingly will rely on the use of
telecommunications and information technologies in support of their
missions.  NTIA will work with the FCC to assist Federal, state and local
public safety offices to utilize such technologies effectively and efficiently. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">	Levels of concentration of ownership in telecommunications and media
industries appear to be increasing rapidly.  This increased concentration
raises policy and legal questions, requiring continued collaboration with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice.  </FONT></P>



<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">It is impossible to predict with any certainty the pace of change in the
telecommunications and information industries.  The future is exciting and
challenging.  Indeed, as President Clinton said in his 1997 State of the Union
Address: "The new promise of the global economy, the information age,
unimagined new work, life-enhancing technology: All these are ours to seize.  That
is our honor and our challenge.  <STRONG>We must be shapers of events, not observers</STRONG>, for if
we do not act, the moment will pass and we will lose the best possibilities of our
future."  </FONT></P>



<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular" SIZE="+1"><STRONG></STRONG></FONT><FONT FACE="Univers Regular"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></FONT><FONT FACE="Univers Regular"><STRONG><EM>The NTIA Role</EM></STRONG></FONT><FONT FACE="Univers Regular"></FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">The new digital era requires a public policy environment that embraces innovation,
encourages competition, and empowers consumers.  In fulfillment of its role as the
President's principal adviser on telecommunications and information policy issues,
NTIA must keep pace with these issues and cultivate synergy with the FCC, the
State Department and the USTR, as well as with the full range of Federal agencies
such as the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, Department of
Transportation, and others that use telecommunications in discharging their
responsibilities for the nation's safety and well-being.  It is critical that NTIA
continue to fulfill a leadership role on telecommunication and information policies.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Univers Regular">At NTIA, the admonition "Lead, follow, or get out of the way" is particularly
appropriate.  The Federal government has a critical responsibility to assist in
shaping the global telecommunications and information policy debate.   A key NTIA
role is to ensure that government does not obstruct private sector innovation and
the rapid deployment of telecommunications technology.  Today, and even more
urgently in the future, NTIA must exercise a blend of leadership and collegiality that
synergizes with a complex network of federal, state, local, and international
entities.   </FONT></P>
