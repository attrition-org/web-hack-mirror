<BR>ACTION ON SATELLITE HOME VIEWER LEGISLATION</center></STRONG></P>


<P><STRONG>WASHINGTON-</STRONG>Commerce Secretary William M. Daley has urged a Senate-House
Conference Committee to quickly resolve outstanding issues relating to a proposed bill
that would give consumers in remote areas greater access to network television programming
and to local television signals.</P>

<P>In separate letters to key members of the Conference Committee, Daley noted that the proposed
bill should be designed to ultimately enhance consumer choice and promote competition in the
multichannel video marketplace. The Conference Committee is comprised of members from the
House and Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees.  </P>

<P>"The Administration believes the viewing public's interest should be of paramount importance
during the conference Committee's deliberations," Daley said. "The Administration is
particularly concerned that broadcast carriage issues be decided in a way that promotes greater
access to local television signals for all Americans and enables satellite service providers to offer
services comparable to cable and thus spur competition," he said. </P>

<P>Daley also urged the Conference Committee to "refrain from imposing any other broadcast
carriage regulation unless the Federal Communications Commission has had an opportunity to
examine the potential impact (of such regulations) on satellite carriers."</P>

<P>The legislation would reauthorize the Satellite Home Viewer ACT (SHVA) for an additional five
years. It permits satellite carriers to deliver distant network programming signals to consumers
who otherwise cannot receive network programming through their local broadcast stations. The
bill would also, for the first time, authorize satellite carriers to offer local broadcast signals to
consumers in their local market. The Act expires in December and at that time satellite
consumers will lose access to network programming. </P>
