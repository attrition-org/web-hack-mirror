<p><b><font size=+1>Commerce Secretary Daley Announces $17.6 Million in
Matching Fund Awards to Non-Profits for Innovative Uses of Advanced Networking
Technologies</font></b></center>

<p><b>Washington, DC - </b>More than $17 million in matching funds is being
awarded to 43 non-profit and
<br>governmental organizations across the United States to help fund innovative
uses of advanced
<br>networking technologies, the Clinton-Gore Administration announced.
The funds will be used
<br>to<b> </b>improve delivery of social services, enhance the capabilities
of our public safety officials, and
<br>to bring the benefits of information technology to underserved areas
of the country.
<p>"These investments will help close the digital divide by promoting innovative
applications of the Internet and information technology in underserved
urban and rural communities." President Clinton said. "These projects demonstrate
the remarkable potential of information technology to help create opportunity
for all Americans".
<p>"We cannot overestimate the importance of access to the information
age tools required to succeed in this global economy," said Secretary Daley.
"Tomorrow's economy will demand technological literacy and we must rise
to the challenge of ensuring that our workforce of tomorrow will be prepared.
Greater access to the Internet creates more users with better skills and
greater demand for services. This year's grant recipients are truly leading
the way in the use of new computer and information technologies that will
help transform people's lives," said Secretary Daley.
<p>The Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA) administers the Telecommunications and Information
Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP), which awards grants annually
to non-profit organizations and state and local governments, for innovative,
yet practical, projects using information technologies. This year's 43
grant recipients were chosen from over 702 applicants. The $17.6 million
in TIIAP funds will be matched by $21 million in funding from non-Federal
sources, resulting in a $38.6 million investment in our nation's information
infrastructure.
<p>"In awarding this year's grants, we noticed several interesting and
important trends," said Larry Irving, assistant secretary of Commerce and
administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA). "Specifically, we are pleased to see that more and morecommunities
are making comprehensive databases and advanced communication tools available
to their citizens and community leaders, empowering them to more effectively
determine the community's needs and target resources better."
<p>"Our nation's health care organizations are finding niche areas where
telemedicine can help improve the quality of care being delivered and,
in some cases even save lives, as well as saving costs. And, rural communities
are finding more ways to bring educational opportunities, access to social
services, and health care to its most isolated citizens."
<p>This year's grants include:
<ul>
<li>
Second Harvest in Illinois will provide near real-time communication links
between food banks and organizations that feed the hungry to help alleviate
the nearly 60 million pounds of food that gets wasted each year in the
U.S.;</li>

<li>
the Georgia-based Shepherd Center will place laptops with video-conferencing
capability in the homes of victims of spinal cord and brain injuries. These
victims, who face a lifetime of challenges, will have greater access to
their care givers as well as to clinics and seminars that can help them
in their recovery;</li>

<li>
the Cleveland Housing Network in Ohio will use Internet-based technology
to let community based organizations share data resources and collaborate
on solutions for community revitalization. The project addresses common
national problems, such as access to affordable housing, and allows those
closest to the problems to have the tools to address them; and</li>

<li>
Dance partners, a project of Ballet Arts Minnesota, will use interactive
telecommunications technology to spread the reach of cultural dance to
underserved communities, including the elderly and disabled. Whereas the
50 largest dance companies are concentrated in only ten of our largest
cities, this project has the potential to bring increased exposure to dance
in rural areas.</li>
</ul>
"The lessons learned from these grants will be shared across the nation
and throughout the world. There is tremendous global interest in learning
how the tools of the 21<sup>st</sup> century can be used to improve the
quality of lives," said Irving. "The experiences of these TIIAP grant recipients
will help inform those who are just beginning to determine how to bring
the benefits of new technologies to their communities and villages."
<p>Descriptions of each of the 43 grant recipients, along with contact
information, are posted on NTIA's website at <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov.">http://www.ntia.doc.gov.</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"We encourage people who are interested in learning about the grant
program to visit the website or call us at (202) 482-2048," said Bernadette
McGuire-Rivera, administrator of NTIA's grants office.
<p>The TIIAP program was initiated in 1994. It has awarded $135 million
in award funds that has spurred over $339 million in total investments.
<p>NTIA serves as the principal adviser to the executive branch on domestic
and international telecommunications issues. TIIAP awards grants annually
to non-profit organizations to help bring the benefits of technology to
rural and underserved areas.
