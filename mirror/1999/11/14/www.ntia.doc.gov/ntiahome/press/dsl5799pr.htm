<p><b>COMMERCE DEPARTMENT URGES THE FCC TO CLARIFY RULES TO ENCOURAGE DEPLOYMENT
OF BROADBAND SERVICES BY LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES</b></center>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Department of Commerce today urged
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to issue a ruling that would
encourage local telephone companies to sell advanced speed digital subscriber
line (DSL) services to Internet service providers ISPs at discounted rates.
ISPs could then resell those services to individual users along with the
ISPs' Internet services --- speeding the deployment of broadband services
to residential and business subscribers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">"Broadband technology is something the
American consumer is clamoring for," Commerce Secretary William M. Daley
said, "The Department of Commerce supports initiatives that will diffuse
those services more rapidly."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Department of Commerce, through the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), <a href="../fccfilings/dslresaleltr5799.htm">urged
the FCC to clarify</a> that DSL services sold by local telephone companies
to ISPs are not "retail" services subject to the resale requirements of
the Telecommunications Act of 1996. As a result, local telephone companies
need not make those services available to competing carriers at a discount
from the rates charged to ISPs.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">At the same time, the Department favored
the imposition of conditions to ensure that the prices that ISPs pay for
DSL service will be available on fair and equitable terms to other prospective
buyers, including competing carriers. Larry Irving, assistant secretary
of Commerce for Communications and Information said: "While the Administration
strongly favors government policies that foster widespread deployment of
broadband services, we believe that it is imperative that such policies
also further the procompetitive goals of the 1996 Act."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Accordingly, NTIA asserted that while DSL
services sold to ISPs are not "retail" in nature, they are telecommunications
services. Thus, the FCC should ensure that:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">• Local telephone companies adhere
to their basic common carrier obligations to provide such services to all
customers upon reasonable request on just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory
terms and in accordance with all applicable tariff requirements.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• All DSL rates, including volume and term
discounts, must cover all relevant costs, including a reasonable share
of the costs of the underlying subscriber line.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• In negotiations and arbitrations conducted
under the 1996 Act, competing carriers should be entitled, at a minimum,
to the same discount (from the prevailing retail DSL rate) that a telephone
company makes available to ISPs for comparable levels of demand and lengths
of service agreement.</font></blockquote>
