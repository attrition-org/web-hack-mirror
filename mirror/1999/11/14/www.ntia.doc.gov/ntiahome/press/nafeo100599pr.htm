<p><b><font size=+1>COMMERCE SECRETARY DALEY ANNOUNCES CONTRACT FOR STUDY
AIMED AT PROMOTING INTERNET ACCESS BY BLACK COLLEGES</font></b></center>

<p><b>WASHINGTON - </b>Commerce Secretary William M. Daley today announced
the award of a $90,027 contract for a study on the status of telecommunications
capabilities of the nations's 116 historically black colleges and universities
as part of a Clinton-Gore Administration initiative to help develop an
information technology infrastructure that is accessible to all Americans.
<p>Daley said the study, to be conducted by the National Association for
Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, will enable the Commerce Department
to identify the technology and telecommunications needs of black college
and university communities and help determine how the department can better
assist them in accessing the Internet.
<p>"Access to information resources is critical to taking courses, researching,
finding a job or public information," Daley said. "In a society that increasingly
relies on computers and the Internet to deliver information, it is important
to ensure that all Americans have access to information technology so that
they can continue to be a part of our economic growth and prosperity."
<p>The study is part of several initiatives the department is undertaking
to try to close the "digital divide"--the gap between those with access
to information technology and those without. The department's National
Telecommunications and Information Administration, in a report issued in
July, said that while more Americans than ever were connected to the Internet
the gap between the information "haves"and "haves nots" persists and has
widened significantly in the last few years, with minorities among those
lacking access.
<p>The contract for the study was awarded by the Commerce Department's
NTIA. Besides helping NTIA determine the computer capabilities of the black
colleges, the study will, among other things, help promote telecommunications
innovation, research and engineering, foster the institutions' continued
growth in the economy and increase opportunities for their participation
in NTIA- supported projects.
<p>The NAFEO is the only membership organization of all 116 historically
and predominantly black colleges and universities in the nation and administers
a number of programs that seek to strengthen their institutional capacities.
