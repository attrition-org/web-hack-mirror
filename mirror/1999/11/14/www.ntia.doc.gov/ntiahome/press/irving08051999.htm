<p><b>ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS</b>
<br><b>LARRY IRVING TO LEAVE COMMERCE</b>
<p><b>WASHINGTON-- </b>Larry Irving, assistant secretary of Commerce for
Telecommunications and Information, will leave the Commerce Department
post at the end of the summer, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley announced
today. Irving will be succeeded by Gregory L. Rohde, Senior Legislative
Assistant to Democratic Senator Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota.
<p><a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/irvbio.html">Irving</a>, the
first African American to head the Commerce Department agency, was appointed
by President Clinton in 1993. He played a major role in the Administration's
efforts to bring about the most sweeping reform of U.S. telecommunications
law in 60 years, the Telecommunications Act of 1996. He was also a key
proponent within the Clinton-Gore Administration of policies designed to
promote diversity in the commercial broadcast arena and to increase opportunities
for minorities and women in the emerging digital economy.
<p>Secretary Daley, in accepting Irving's resignation, said: "Larry has
been a tremendous asset to the Department of Commerce. He has been a master
at crafting the Administration's telecommunications policy in a way that
the resulting vast economic benefits will be accessible to Americans from
all walks of life. I wish him well in his future endeavors."
<p>During his six-year tenure at the Commerce Department, Irving earned
a reputation as an international leader in telecommunications and information
policy. He worked to open foreign markets to the U.S. telecommunications
industry, secure better protection for consumers and open up advanced telecommunications
services to rural and other underserved areas of the country.
<p>A member of the Clinton-Gore Administration's technology team, Irving
played a major role in the Administration's initiatives to promote <a href="http://www.iitf.nist.gov/eleccomm/ecomm.htm">Electronic
Commerce</a> and the <a href="http://iitf.doc.gov/">Information Superhighway</a>.
<p>Most recently, Irving initiated a landmark Federal Government survey,
"<a href="../digitaldivide/index.html">The Digital
Divide: Falling Through the Net</a>," which showed more Americans than
ever have become connected to computers, telephones and the Internet, while
the gap between information "haves" and "have nots" has widened significantly.
The report recommended that pro-competition policies and initiatives aimed
at increasing Internet access be pursued to close the digital divide.
<p>Irving's successor, Gregory Rohde has served as Senator Dorgan's chief
policy advisor on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
which includes technology and telecommunications issues. He has contributed
to significant legislation including, the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
Before joining Senator Dorgan's staff, he served as a Team Coordinator
for the Health Care Financing Administration on the Transition team for
the Clinton-Gore Administration.
