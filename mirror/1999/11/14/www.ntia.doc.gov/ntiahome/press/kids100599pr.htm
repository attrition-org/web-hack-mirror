<p><b><font size=+1>COMMERCE SECRETARY DALEY RELEASES REPORT ON</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>HOW COMMERCE PROGRAM HELPS YOUTH PREPARE FOR</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>FUTURE THROUGH INTERNET ACCESS</font></b>
<p><b>WASHINGTON-</b>Commerce Secretary William M. Daley today released
a new report that discusses how a Commerce Department program providing
access to information technologies has helped create new opportunities
for America's children and helped them better prepare for the future.
<p>The report profiles projects funded by the Department's National Telecommunications
and Information Administration (NTIA) and shows how America's children
are using the Internet and other electronic tools to deal with the digital
world and enrich the communities in which they live. The projects were
funded under NTIA's <a href="../../otiahome/tiiap/index.html">Telecommunications
and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP)</a>.
<p>"This report illustrates how programs such as TIIAP and policies that
extend such opportunities to those most in need are small investments that
will yield large dividends for the future of America's children," Secretary
Daley said in releasing the report at a Techies Day Celebration at Woodrow
Wilson High School in Washington, D.C. "It shows how networking tools are
offering children opportunities to form an array of rewarding relationships
and helping to make their communities better places to live," Daley said.
<p>"These TIIAP-funded projects demonstrate how access to the Internet
creates opportunities to tap the creativity of children, to nurture their
artistic talents and to create bonds between generations," NTIA Administrator,
Larry Irving said.
<p>The report, "<a href="../../otiahome/tiiap/resources/How_ABC.pdf">How
access Benefits Children: Connecting Our Kids to the World of Information</a>"
(in .pdf format), shows , among other things, how kids are creating new
musical work online in collaboration with adult artist mentors; how children
are reaching out to and learning from seniors through a TIIAP-supported
online electronic network; and how children acting as "agents of change"
are involving themselves directly in the economic revitalization of their
communities.
