<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>NTIA'S OFFICE OF SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT FILES COMMENTS IN RESPONSE
TO FCC NPRM REGARDING PROTECTION OF GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM  </STRONG></P>


<P><STRONG>WASHINGTON, DC --</STRONG> Larry Irving, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and
Information, in comments filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on June 21,
1999, supported the FCC's proposed limits on the use of satellite communications services as
providing a reasonable balance between protecting the safety of aircraft and maritime navigation
and facilitating transmission of data for consumers all over the world.</P>


<P>The comments were filed in response to the FCC's proposed rule regarding the protection of the
Global Positioning System (GPS), used in radio navigation, from the out-of-band emissions of
mobile satellite service (MSS) earth terminals used to transmit voice and data services.</P>


<P>"The (Commerce Department's) National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA) believes that establishment of these (FCC) limits strikes a reasonable balance between the
public interest in fostering improvement in aeronautical radio navigation and the global roaming
of MSS terminals," Irving said.</P>


<P>In 1997, NTIA, in coordination with the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee, filed a
petition of rulemaking with the FCC to adopt out-of-band emission limits for MSS earth terminals
operating in the 1610-1660.5 MHZ band. The out-of-band emission limits in NTIA's petition
were developed through a deliberative process involving representatives of the GPS, MSS, and
aviation communities. These limits were established to protect the U.S. GPS and the Russian
Federation Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) receivers operating in the 1559-1605
MHZ band that are used for aircraft  precision-approach landings.  GPS and GLONASS and their
augmentation systems are constituent elements of the Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS).</P>


<P>The MSS earth terminal out-of-band emission limits proposed by the Commission are essentially
in accordance with NTIA's recommendation, Irving said.  NTIA believes that establishment of
such limits strikes a reasonable balance between the public interest in fostering improvement in
aeronautical radionavigation and facilitating the global roaming of MSS terminals in accordance
with the Global Mobile Communications by Satellite Memorandum of Understanding (GMPCS
MoU) developed within the International Telecommunications Union.  "These GMPCS systems
will provide additional choices for delivery of seamless voice, data, and broadband services for
consumers in all parts of the world," said Commerce Assistant Secretary Larry Irving.</P>

on domestic and international communications and information issues and represents the
Executive Branch before the Congress, other Federal agencies, foreign governments and
international organizations.  NTIA's Office of Spectrum Management oversees and coordinates
Federal Government spectrum use.  For more information regarding the comments submitted by
