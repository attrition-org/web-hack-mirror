<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>NTIA'S OFFICE OF SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT ANNOUNCES A JOINT PUBLIC
SAFETY INTEROPERABILITY CHANNELING PLAN</STRONG></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Improved Communications During Emergencies<STRONG></STRONG></P>


<P><STRONG>WASHINGTON, DC --</STRONG> Larry Irving, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and
Information, today announced plans to designate certain federally allocated radio frequencies for
use by federal, state and local law enforcement and incident response entities to improve their
communications during emergencies and help them to better respond to threats to public safety.</P>


<P>"This new plan is the first step towards ensuring that sufficient radio spectrum is available when
and where an emergency or public safety need may arise," Irving said.</P>


<P>The plan was developed in cooperation with the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee
(IRAC) and the Federal Law Enforcement Wireless Users' Group (FLEWUG).  "It provides a
total of 40 radio frequencies, under the control of the federal government, to be used for
intermittent law enforcement and incident response requirements during emergencies relating to
public safety," Irving said.</P>


<P>NTIA serves as the principal adviser to the President, Vice President and Secretary of Commerce
on domestic and international communications and information issues and represents the
Executive Branch before the Congress, other Federal agencies, foreign governments and
international organizations.  NTIA's Office of Spectrum Management oversees and coordinates
Federal Government spectrum use.  For more information about the new interoperability plan or
NTIA's Public Safety Program, please contact William Speights at (202) 482-1726 or visit NTIA's
Public Safety Home Page at http://pswac.ntia.doc.gov.</P>
