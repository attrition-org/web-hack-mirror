<P><center>COMMERCE DEPARTMENT HOSTS CONFERENCE TO DISCUSS
IMPACT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON PEOPLE'S LIVES

<P>Two-day session sets stage for December Summit to explore methods of closing
the nation's growing digital divide</EM></STRONG></center>

<P><STRONG>WASHINGTON-</STRONG>More than 600 people, including government and industry leaders, will
convene at a Commerce Department-sponsored conference in Washington Nov. 1-2 to discuss
how information technology is transforming people's lives and showcase some strategies for
bridging the nation's growing digital divide.</P>


<P>Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said the conference provided a stepping stone to the
Commerce Department's Digital Divide Summit planned for next month. The Summit will bring
together government leaders and corporate executives from across the country to discuss how the
public and private sectors could work together to provide all Americans access to information
technology, a key element in their advancement and economic success. </P>


<P>"Today, about 60 percent of American households lack access to computers and roughly three-quarters of households lack Internet access," Daley said in prepared welcoming remarks."The
gap between information 'haves' and 'have nots,' if it continues, threatens to impair the well
being of our communities, the development of a skilled workforce and the economic health of
our nation. Therefore, we must be sure that the benefits of the Information Age are available to
all Americans," Daley said.</P>


<P>"We will be following the proceedings of this Networks for People conference closely and will
be building on the outcomes as we prepare for the December 9<SUP>th</SUP> (Digital Divide) summit," Daley
said.</P>


<P>"The tremendous interest in this conference is another indicator of the eagerness of communities
to participate in the information age," said Bernadette McGuire-Rivera, Acting Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Communications and Information.</P>


<P>"We are also very pleased with the international and corporate participation this year," she said.</P>

<P>The 1999 Annual "Networks for People '99 Conference",  sponsored by the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration's Telecommunications and Information
Assistance Program (TIIAP),  provides a forum for government officials, industry leaders and
practitioners to discuss how people are using the information technology to change the way they
live, do business and get educated.<INS>  </INS>TIIAP is a highly-competitive grant program that promotes
the widespread availability and use of advanced telecommunications in the public and nonprofit
sectors. </P>


<P>This year's program features a session on bridging the digital divide and will include a
presentation by David Bolt, who will preview his upcoming PBS series "The Digital Divide."</P>

<P>It will also introduce a new philanthropic initiative, Helping.Org, a collaborative effort of the
Benton Foundation, the AOL Foundation and other non- profit partners. A demonstration of the
site will showcase resources and tools available through Helping.Org. </P>


<P>Other keynote addresses: Gary Chapman, director of the University of Texas' 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century
Project and a featured columnist for the Los Angeles Times, will discuss "Where is Information
Technology Taking Us?"; Dr. Carol Ann Bonds will discuss her successful and nationally known
TIIAP project "Kids As Agents of Change". </P>
