<p>July 8, 1999
<p>The Honorable Tom Bliley
<br>Chairman, Committee on Commerce
<br>United States House of Representatives
<br>Room 2125 Rayburn House Office Building
<br>Washington, DC 20515
<p>Dear Chairman Bliley:
<p>I am writing to respond to your letter to Secretary Daley dated June
22, 1999, in which you express concern about recent steps taken by the
<a href="http://www.icann.org/">Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a> ("ICANN") related to the
transition to privatized management of the Internet Domain Name System
("DNS").
<p>The Department of Commerce welcomes the Committee's continuing interest
in this process. As you point out in your letter, we share the same goal:
transitioning DNS management responsibility to a new, not-for-profit corporation
"governed on the basis of a sound and transparent decision making-process,
which protects against capture by a self-interested faction." To this end,
Department staff has regularly met with the Committee staff to provide
information and to seek Congressional input concerning this complex process.
<p>Before turning to the specific questions posed in your letter, I thought
it would be useful to provide a more general report on the status of the
DNS transition process.
<p><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><b>Summary</b></span><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span>
<p>The Commerce Department's Statement of Policy on the <i><a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">Management
of Internet Names and Addresses</a></i> (the "White Paper"), issued thirteen
months ago, identified a number of tasks to be undertaken on a priority
basis in order to transition DNS management to the private sector:
<blockquote>(1) private sector creation and organization of a new, not-for-profit
corporation to conduct DNS management; (2) rapid introduction of competition
in the provision of domain name registration services; (3) adoption of
policies to reduce conflicts between trademark holders and domain name
registrants; and (4) review of the root server system to increase the security
and professional management of that system.</blockquote>

<p><br><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Creation and Organization
of New Corporation</span>
<p>ICANN has made considerable progress toward establishing the structures
for representative decision making contemplated in the White Paper, but
there is still important work to be done:
<ul>
<li>
ICANN's top priority must be completing the work necessary to put in place
an elected board of directors on a timely basis. Specifically, it must
do everything within its power to establish the Supporting Organizations,
and ensure the election of nine board members by those Organizations to
begin serving at the November 1999 Board Meeting. And it must work diligently
to complete the process for electing at-large directors by June 2000. (Page
11)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
ICANN should eliminate the $1 per-year per domain name registration user
fee. Although the user fee may be determined to be an appropriate method
for funding ICANN's activities, it has become controversial, and we believe
a permanent financing method should not be adopted until after the nine
elected members are added to the ICANN Board in November. That will ensure
that this important decision is made in accordance with the representative,
bottom-up process called for in the White Paper. In the meanwhile, we will
work with ICANN and the entire Internet community, to the extent permitted
by law, to obtain interim resources for ICANN. (Page 11)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
ICANN should immediately open its board meetings to the public. Transparency
is critical to establishing trust in decision making. And trust is essential
for ICANN's ultimate success. As a general matter, ICANN has undertaken
the vast majority of its work in an open and transparent manner. The final
step of opening the board meetings is critical to establishing trust in
ICANN. (Page 12)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
There is concern in the Internet community about the possibility of over-regulation,
and therefore ICANN should assure all registrars and registries, through
contract, that it will restrict its policy development activities to matters
that are reasonably necessary to achieve the goals specified in the White
Paper and that it will act in accordance with the procedural principles
set forth in the White Paper. (Page 17)</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
With these actions, and the other steps already taken by ICANN, we believe
that ICANN will put itself on a very firm footing to achieve the goals
and principles spelled out in the White Paper.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Introduction of Competition
in Domain Name Registration</span>
<p>Again, there has been considerable progress: the Shared Registration
System (SRS) has been created; new registrars have been accredited under
guidelines established by ICANN; NSI has licensed the SRS to those registrars
on an interim basis; and testing of the SRS has begun. But significant
work still remains to be done in order to establish robust competition:
<ul>
<li>
NSI must fulfill its obligation to recognize ICANN. This requires NSI and
ICANN to reach agreement on a number of contractual issues. The transition
of DNS management to the private sector can succeed only if all participants
in the domain name system - including NSI - subject themselves to rules
emerging from the consensus based, bottom-up process spelled out in the
White Paper.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
With respect to NSI's provision of registry services - as to which an unsupervised
NSI would be able to exercise market power today and for the foreseeable
future - we believe the NSI-ICANN agreement must assure reasonable supervision
to prevent the exercise of that market power in a way that injures consumers.
With respect to NSI's provision of registrar services, robust competition
in the provision of those services - and the lower prices and greater choice
that are the benefits of competition - cannot occur until all purveyors
of those services abide by the same rules. (Page 14)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
But what if an agreement cannot be reached? NSI's view is very clear. Its
position is that when Cooperative Agreement terminates, whether prematurely
or upon its expiration on September 30, 2000, NSI will be free to operate
these domains without any supervision by the Government. The Commerce Department
believes just as strongly that NSI does not have the legal right to operate
these domains in the authoritative root in perpetuity. We believe that
all or part of the functions now performed by NSI under the Cooperative
Agreement could be reassigned through a competition and, unless NSI won
the competition, it would cease to have any legal right to provide the
recompeted services. And even if that were not so, an NSI unconstrained
under US law would quickly become a target of action by other countries
in order to protect consumers against the exercise of market power. (Page
18)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
This path - failure to reach agreement with ICANN, recompetition of the
Cooperative Agreement and the likely results that would follow, together
with action by foreign governments - would be extremely destabilizing for
the Internet and therefore quite harmful to its development. We have been
able to reach agreement with NSI in the past each time it has been necessary
to do so in order to enable the DNS process to move forward. There is no
reason to believe that agreement cannot be reached on the remaining questions.
We believe all parties should put aside inflammatory rhetoric, set aside
parochial concerns, and work for a fair solution that is in the interest
of the entire Internet community. (Page 19)</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
NSI and the Department of Commerce must reach agreement on a post-Testbed
license for registrars' use of the SRS. Remaining issues include modification
of the SRS to allow registrars to offer different term lengths (and thus
compete on this basis in addition to price); and allowing registrants to
switch registrars without forfeiting the time remaining on an existing
registration contract, upon payment of a cost-based transfer fee (the current
system requires the transferring registrant to forfeit all time on its
existing registration and pay an additional two-year fee). We are very
concerned that imposing this monetary penalty on transfer of existing registrations
among registrars creates a barrier to robust competition. We also must
reach agreement on the size of the per-registration fee to be paid to NSI
as registry. (Page 20)
<ul>
<li>
NSI and the Department of Commerce also must resolve issues regarding the
availability of the WHOIS database, and the .com, .net, and .org zone files.
NSI took certain actions earlier this year without the consent of the Commerce
Department that restricted access to this information, which had previously
been widely and readily available to the Internet community. We strongly
support the prohibition of uses that adversely affect the operational stability
of the Internet, but we oppose other restrictions on third-party use of
this information, which has been compiled by NSI in the course of its operations
under the authority of the U.S. Government. (Page 21)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
The Commerce Department and NSI also must reach agreement concerning the
appropriate use of the InterNIC.net website. (Page 22)</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
<span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Domain Names and Trademarks</span>
<ul>
<li>
The provisions of the ICANN Accreditation Agreement, together with the
recommendations of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
when fully implemented, reflect the recommendations of the White Paper
related to reducing friction between trademark owners and domain name holders.
We commend ICANN for its prompt action on these issues, and urge it to
proceed promptly, pursuant to the appropriate ICANN procedures, to establish
a uniform dispute resolution procedure for cybersquatting. (Page 23)</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
<span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Management of the Root Server
System</span>
<ul>
<li>
The Department of Commerce and ICANN are proceeding to implement the White
Paper's call to develop and implement means to increase the security and
professional management of the Internet root server system. (Page 24)</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><b>Background</b></span></li>
</ul>
The Internet we know today grew rapidly from its origins as a United States
government research project into an international medium for commerce,
education, and communication. When the application known as the World Wide
Web was launched, the information riches of the Internet became readily
accessible to non-technical end-users. No longer an exclusive province
of computer scientists, a broad range of interests -- commercial, non-profit,
educational, and other -- joined the Internet community and began using
the Internet to communicate, to exchange ideas and information, and to
conduct commerce.
<p>When the Administration began its review of electronic commerce issues
in 1996, there were two existing governmental mechanisms for coordinating
the DNS. Those government mechanisms consisted of (1) a cooperative agreement
between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Network Solutions, Inc.
(NSI) for managing the generic top level domains (gTLDs) (the Cooperative
Agreement), and (2) a contract between the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) and the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) at the University
of Southern California under which the ISI performed a number of management
and policy coordination functions collectively known as the Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority (IANA). By early 1997, it was clear that although these
mechanisms had adequately managed the system in its early years, each had
inherent limitations that could create a drag on the growth of the Internet.
<p>With respect to technical and policy coordination, IANA functioned ably
for years under the leadership of the late Dr. Jon Postel. Dr. Postel was
a well respected technologist, skilled in the art of conflict resolution
as well. As the Internet community became increasingly diverse, however,
and as the disputes became commercial in nature, it became unworkable to
rely on a single individual to coordinate the domain name system. Dr. Postel
recognized this and initiated an international discussion, called the International
Ad Hoc Committee (IAHC) in September of 1996. The IAHC process lead to
the creation of the gTLD Memorandum of Understanding (gTLD MOU). The Administration
was concerned that the gTLD MOU relied too heavily on international governmental
bodies and did not enjoy adequate support from the commercial community
and other private sector communities.
<p>The Cooperative Agreement between NSF and NSI made NSI the exclusive
provider of registration services in the .com, .net, and .org gTLDs, encompassing
both management of what we now refer to as the central database, or "registry"
function, as well as serving as the interface with individual domain name
registrants, the "registrar" function. Initially, NSF paid NSI to perform
these tasks. Beginning in 1995, however, NSF authorized NSI to charge $70
for a two-year registration.
<p>For a number of reasons, primarily having to do with the global nature
of the Internet, .com, .net, and .org today enjoy a dominant position in
the most commercially valuable Internet registrations.<sup><a href="#N_1_">
(1)</a></sup> Registrations in .com, .net and .org account for nearly 75%
of all third level domain name registrations.<sup><a href="#N_2_"> (2)</a></sup>
Put simply, a .com, .net, and .org domain name today is the overwhelming
choice for entities launching commercial and non-profit Internet applications
designed to appeal to a multinational audience. In more conventional economic
terms, registering a name in these domains is so commercially attractive
that an exclusive provider of registry or registrar services for these
domains would be able to exercise market power in dictating the terms for
the provision of those services, because its terms are not likely to be
subject to competition from alternative name registration options. Whether
or not competition will develop in the future is not possible to predict,
but today - and for the reasonably foreseeable future - there simply is
no competitive alternative.
<p>Consumers and businesses around the world began to complain about the
absence of competition in this lucrative domain name registration market.
Governments around the world complained that it was inappropriate that
these services were available exclusively through a monopoly created and
controlled by the United States government.
<p>Thus, when the Administration began work on DNS privatization there
was widespread disapproval of the then-current DNS management structure,
and change was clearly needed to address a number of issues:
<ul>
<li>
There was widespread dissatisfaction about the absence of competition in
domain name registration.</li>

<li>
Conflicts between trademark holders and domain name holders had become
increasingly common, and mechanisms for resolving these conflicts were
expensive and cumbersome.</li>

<li>
Commercial users, many of whom were staking their future on the successful
growth of the Internet, were calling for a robust and professional management
structure.</li>

<li>
An increasing number of Internet users resided outside the United States,
and they desired increased participation in the formulation of policy related
to the management of the DNS.</li>

<li>
Continued direction and funding of DNS activities by U.S. research agencies
was becoming inappropriate, given the increasingly global and commercial
nature of the Internet.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>On July 1, 1997, the President released <i>A Framework for Global
Electronic Commerce </i>and directed the Secretary of Commerce to privatize
the management of the DNS in a manner that increases competition and facilitates
international participation in its management.
<p>On June 5, 1998, the Department of Commerce issued a Statement of Policyentitled<i>
Management of Internet Names and Addresses </i>(the "White Paper").<sup><a href="#N_3_">
(3)</a></sup> The White Paper was the product of an extensive public consultation
process that included a Request for Comments (RFC), on which the Department
received more than 430 comments, and a discussion draft entitled <i>A Proposal
to Improve the Technical Management of Internet Names and Addresses </i>(the
"Green Paper"), on which the Department received more than 650 comments.<sup><a href="#N_4_">
(4)</a></sup> In addition to conducting a careful review of the comments
received on the RFC and the Green Paper, the Administration consulted extensively
with a wide variety of members of the Internet community including Internet
engineers, businesses using the Internet, intellectual property holders,
civil liberties advocates, non-commercial domain name holders, Internet
users, and governments around the world. The Department of Commerce also
consulted with Congress, and participated in three Congressional hearings.
<p>The White Paper, reflecting the views of the overwhelming majority of
commenters, called upon the private sector to create a new, not-for-profit
corporation to assume responsibility, over time, for the management of
certain aspects of the DNS. The White Paper identified four specific functions
to be performed by this new corporation:
<ul>
<li>
To set policy for and direct the allocation of Internet protocol (IP) number
blocks;</li>

<li>
To develop overall policy guidance and control of top level domains (TLDs)
and the Internet root server system;</li>

<li>
To develop policies for the addition, allocation, and management of gTLDs,
the establishment of domain name registries and domain name registrars
and the terms, including licensing terms, applicable to new and existing
gTLDs and registries under which registries, registrars, and gTLDs are
permitted to operate<span STYLE="COLOR: red">;</span></li>

<li>
To coordinate maintenance and dissemination of the protocol parameters
for Internet addressing.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
The White Paper also articulated the fundamental policies that would guide
United States participation in the transfer of DNS management responsibility
to the private sector: stability; competition; private, bottom-up coordination;
and representation.
<p>The White Paper listed a number of tasks to be undertaken on a priority
basis.
<p><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">First</span>, the creation
and organization of a new, not-for-profit corporation to manage the DNS.
The White Paper anticipated the need for an interim or initial (the terms
are used interchangeably) Board of Directors of the new, not-for-profit
corporation to carry out specific tasks expeditiously. The interim board
was to establish a system for electing the Board of Directors the new corporation
and complete its organization in accordance with the White Paper principles.
<p><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Second</span>, the White Paper
identified as a high priority the rapid introduction of competition in
the provision of domain name registration services. The interim board of
the new corporation was to develop policies for the addition of new TLDs
and to establish qualifications for domain name registries and registrars.
The Department of Commerce committed to enter into an agreement with NSI
by which NSI would agree to take specific actions, including commitments
as to pricing and equal access, designed to permit the development of competition
in domain name registration and to approximate the conditions that would
be expected in the presence of marketplace competition.
<p><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Third</span>, the White Paper
recommended that the new corporation promptly adopt specific policies designed
to reduce conflicts between trademark holders and domain name registrants.
The White Paper indicated that the United States would ask the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) to convene an international process to develop
a set of recommendations on these matters to be presented to the Interim
Board for its consideration as soon as possible.
<p><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Fourth</span>, the White Paper
committed the United States to undertake a review of the root server system
to recommend means to increase the security and professional management
of the system. The recommendations of this study were to be implemented
as part of the transition process, and the new corporation was to develop
a comprehensive security strategy for DNS management.
<p>The following is an examination of progress made to date, and work remaining
to be done, in each of these areas.
<p><b>B.&nbsp;<span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Private Sector Creation
and Organization of the New Corporation</b></span>
<p>The White Paper's call for private sector creation of a new, not-for-profit
corporation to manage DNS issues resulted in five separate submissions,
each of which was posted by NTIA for comment.<sup><a href="#N_5_"> (5)</a></sup>
The submissions and comments received evidenced clear support for moving
forward with the submission of the IANA on behalf of the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). On October 20, 1998, NTIA wrote
to ICANN noting the public support for moving forward with the ICANN model.<sup><a href="#N_6_">
(6)</a></sup> NTIA's letter also cited a number of specific concerns raised
by commenters, and asked ICANN to address these concerns. Following receipt
of a revised ICANN submission<sup><a href="#N_7_"> (7)</a></sup>, the Department
of Commerce entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with ICANN for collaborative
development and testing of the mechanisms, methods, and procedures necessary
to transition management responsibility for specific DNS functions to the
private sector.<sup><a href="#N_8_"> (8)</a></sup> The MOU constituted
recognition of ICANN as the new, not-for-profit corporation for DNS management
and specifically contemplated ultimate transition of management responsibility
to ICANN. Consistent with the White Paper approach, however, any such transition
would occur over time as the corporation becomes operational and stable.
<p>Also in October of 1998, the Department of Commerce and NSI amended
the Cooperative Agreement to facilitate the stable evolution of the domain
name system in accordance with the White Paper. Amendment 11 to the Cooperative
Agreement<sup><a href="#N_9_"> (9)</a></sup> had four specific purposes,
including "the recognition by NSI of the new, not-for-profit corporation
when recognized by the U.S. Government in accordance with the White Paper."
Because Amendment 11 was executed on October 7, 1998, prior to the Department
of Commerce's recognition of ICANN on November 25, 1998, the new not-for-profit
corporation was referred to in Amendment 11 as "NewCo." Amendment 11 also
extended the Cooperative Agreement through the transition period (until
September 30, 2000) but specifically provided that as the United States
Government transitioned DNS responsibilities to ICANN, corresponding obligations
under the Cooperative Agreement would be terminated and, as appropriate,
covered in a contract between NSI and ICANN.
<p><b>1.&nbsp;<span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Progress on Organization
of ICANN and Election of Board of Directors</b></span><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span>
<p>ICANN's achievements are very impressive, especially given the difficulty
in creating a new organization to represent the multifaceted Internet community.
Over the past seven months it has made steady progress in establishing
structures for the representative, bottom-up processes contemplated in
the White Paper.
<p>ICANN's submission to the Department of Commerce, which included its
Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation, contemplated the creation of three
policy development bodies, called "supporting organizations" or "SOs."
Half of the elected board, or nine members, were to come from the SOs.<sup><a href="#N_10_">
(10)</a></sup>
<p>In keeping with the principle of private, bottom-up coordination, the
SOs were to be self-forming bodies.
<ul>
<li>
On March 4, 1999, ICANN provisionally recognized the first SO, the Domain
Name Supporting Organization (DNSO). The DNSO is comprised of seven separate
constituency groups, and on May 27, 1999, ICANN recognized six of the DNSO's
seven initial constituencies; recently the final initial constituency --
non-commercial domain name holders -- released a compromise organizational
document.</li>

<li>
ICANN has received a consensus proposal for the formation of the Protocol
Supporting Organization, which it expects to recognize at its next meeting
in August.</li>

<li>
Organizers of the Address Supporting Organization have not reached agreement
on a consensus proposal, although we understand that progress is being
made. It is hoped that a consensus proposal will emerge prior to ICANN's
August meeting.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>As a result of the progress on SO formation, ICANN is expected to
add nine new, elected members to the Board of Directors by the time it
meets in Los Angeles on November 2, 1999.
<p>In response to Internet community consensus that some members of the
board should be elected by a vote of ICANN members, ICANN revised its Bylaws
to require the election of nine At-Large Directors. The ICANN Board has
taken the following steps to implement a system for electing At-Large Directors:
<ul>
<li>
As one of its first actions, ICANN created a Membership Advisory Committee
(MAC) to develop recommendations for a membership structure that would
elect its nine At-Large Directors (and thus replace the initial or interim
board with elected board members).</li>

<li>
The MAC submitted its recommendations for an open membership structure
in May, 1999.</li>

<li>
ICANN staff will report in August on the administrative requirements, cost,
outreach, and logistical requirements of implementing the MAC recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<b>2.&nbsp;<span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Progress Towards Implementation
of Additional Assurances with Respect to Due Process</b></span>
<p>The ICANN bylaws commit the corporation to develop an independent review
process, to provide an additional check on actions taken by the corporation
that are not consistent with its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.
On March 31, 1999, ICANN announced the creation of an Independent Review
Advisory Committee with representatives from seven countries. This committee
is charged to advise ICANN on creation of a structure for independent third
party review of ICANN decisions. It has already begun its work and is expected
to report at the August meeting.
<p><b>3.&nbsp;<span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Important Remaining
Tasks</b></span><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span>
<p>ICANN has accomplished much in the seven months since it was recognized
by the Department of Commerce at the end of 1998, but there is still more
work to be done. The Department wrote to ICANN on July 8, 1999, suggesting
that ICANN take several specific steps in order to implement appropriately
the principles set forth in the White Paper.<sup><a href="#N_11_"> (11)</a></sup>
These suggestions are summarized below:
<ul>
<li>
<b><i>Complete ICANN organizational structure and elect Board of Directors</i></b></li>
</ul>
As indicated above, ICANN is moving towards completion of its organizational
structure and Board election process. It is critical that ICANN do everything
within its power to finalize the organization of the SOs and produce nine
elected board members by November.
<p>The Department of Commerce also expects the ICANN Board to move expeditiously
to establish a process and time-line for electing At-Large Directors. This
task must be ICANN's highest priority. Indeed, we can think of very little
that is more important to the success of this experiment in self-ordering
than the prompt establishment of a fully elected Board of Directors. At
the same time, we believe that no good will be served by moving forward
on elections without appropriate structural safeguards to prevent capture
and/or election fraud. We have called on ICANN to complete this process
by June 2000.
<ul>
<li>
<i>Following the Addition of Elected Board Members in November, adopt a
comprehensive self-funding arrangement based on fair and transparent funding
mechanisms</i></li>
</ul>
The White Paper stated that the new not-for-profit corporation should be
funded by Internet stakeholders, including registries and registrars. ICANN
concluded that it should initially finance its operations through a payment
by registrars of a user fee of $1 per year per domain name registered.
This payment obligation was included in the accreditation agreement formulated
by ICANN after notice, opportunity to comment, and a public meeting.<sup><a href="#N_12_">
(12)</a></sup>
<p>In recent weeks the user fee has become controversial. Although the
$1 fee may be determined to be an appropriate method for funding ICANN
activities, and we believe such a fee would be lawful,<sup><a href="#N_13_">
(13)</a></sup> we believe that ICANN should eliminate the fee. Adopting
a permanent financing system is an important step that, we believe, should
await the addition of the nine elected Directors in November. That will
ensure that this important decision is made through a representative, bottom-up
process.
<p>To date, ICANN has been funded through corporate contributions and extensions
of credit. In the short term our recommendation means that ICANN must receive
government funding, continue to rely on corporate contributions, or finance
itself through some combination of both sources. We pledge to work with
ICANN and the entire Internet community, to the extent permitted by law,
to secure interim resources for ICANN.
<ul>
<li>
<i>Implement Procedures Designed to Enhance Transparency and Ensure Due
Process</i></li>
</ul>
To date, all ICANN Board meetings have provided for a day of public input
into key questions that have been posted online in advance. This public
input has then been followed by a day in which the Board meets in closed
session, discusses the issues in light of the public input, and then makes
decisions. Minutes of the meetings have been provided promptly, but the
discussions have not been made public. At this important time, when the
process is still evolving and the creation of public trust is crucial to
the success of ICANN, we also recommend that ICANN immediately open its
board meetings to the public. The Board must, of course, retain the ability
to close its meetings when proprietary, confidential, personnel, or litigation-related
matters are being discussed.
<ul>
<li>
<span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Introduction of Competing Registrars
in .com, .net and .org</span></li>
</ul>
One of the principal short-term goals identified in the White Paper is
the introduction of competition in the provision of domain name registration
services. Under the MOU with ICANN and Amendment 11 to the Cooperative
Agreement with NSI, the Department of Commerce, ICANN, and NSI all are
required to participate in opening the gTLDs currently administered by
NSI under the Cooperative Agreement to multiple registrars who would compete
with one another in providing services to new and existing domain name
registrants.
Amendment 11 provided for the development, deployment, and licensing by
NSI (under a license agreement to be approved by the Department of Commerce)
of a mechanism to allow multiple registrars to submit registrations for
the gTLDs for which NSI now acts as the registry. This system is known
as the Shared Registration System, or SRS. Under the MOU, ICANN is called
upon to accredit competing registrars (Accredited Registrars, as identified
in Amendment 11) through development of an accreditation procedure that
subjects such registrars to consistent requirements designed to promote
a stable and robustly competitive DNS.
<ul>
<li>
<span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Progress with Respect to the Introduction
of Competition</span><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span></li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
Considerable progress has been made toward introducing competition, but
a number of serious issues remain unresolved.
<p>a.<i> ICANN's Adoption of Registration Accreditation Guidelines and
Selection of Registrars</i>
<p>On February 8, 1999, ICANN issued proposed guidelines for the selection
and accreditation of registrars in the .com, .net, and .org domains. The
accreditation guidelines (Guidelines), which included a draft agreement
between ICANN and Accredited Registrars (the Accreditation Agreement) addressed
financial and business qualifications, privacy and security issues, the
provision of up-to-date registration information, the need for prepayment
of registration fees, and other items. The Guidelines also specifically
provided that Accredited Registrars would implement trademark dispute resolution
policies when and if such policies were adopted by ICANN.
<p>All of the issues contained in the Guidelines and the Accreditation
Agreement, with the exception of privacy issues, were explicitly contemplated
in the White Paper. With respect to privacy, the Guidelines and the Accreditation
Agreement require Accredited Registrars to notify registrants how their
information would be used, consistent with Administration policy calling
for self-regulation to ensure effective privacy protection on the Internet.<sup><a href="#N_14_">
(14)</a></sup>
<p>ICANN received comments from over 50 individuals and entities, and devoted
a portion of its open meeting on March 3, 1999, to the guidelines. The
guidelines were revised and adopted by ICANN on the basis of this public
input.<sup><a href="#N_15_"> (15)</a></sup>
<p>On April 21, 1999, ICANN selected five Accredited Registrars to participate
in Phase I testing of the SRS (the Testbed). Fifty-two additional registrars
have been approved for accreditation by ICANN to compete once the Testbed
phase is completed, currently scheduled for July 16, 1999.<sup><a href="#N_16_">
(16)</a></sup> NSI agreed in April to permit post-testbed registrars to
receive SRS software in order to begin work prior to the completion of
the testbed. The Department of Commerce has communicated extensively and
directly with registrars accredited by ICANN.
<ul>
<li>
<i>NSI's Development of the SRS and its Interim Licensing Agreement</i></li>
</ul>
Pursuant to Amendment 11 of the Cooperative Agreement, NSI developed the
SRS software to carry out its functions as registry for .com, .net and
.org. The SRS allows multiple registrars to submit domain name registrations
to the registry for the .com, .net and .org domains.
<p>On April 21, 1999, the Department of Commerce approved NSI's License
and Agreement with Accredited Registrars for use during the Testbed period.<sup><a href="#N_17_">
(17)</a></sup> This agreement established a Testbed price cap for registry
services (the price charged by NSI to registrars) of $18 for a two-year
registration.
<p>NSI and the Department of Commerce continue to discuss the terms of
the post-testbed NSI License and Agreement with Accredited Registrars.
The open issues are discussed in greater detail below.
<ul>
<li>
<i>Testing of the SRS is Underway</i></li>
</ul>
Following ICANN's designation of the Testbed Registrars on April 21, 1999,
progress in testing the SRS was slow. Some of the delay is attributable
to implementation glitches, design problems, and other problems that seem
to be inevitable in this business.<sup><a href="#N_18_"> (18)</a></sup>
We continue to monitor the situation and believe that progress is being
made on system testing. At this point, three of the Testbed Accredited
Registrars are performing live registrations, but only one has been doing
so for more than a week. In order to subject the SRS to vigorous testing,
therefore, it will be necessary to extend the Testbed period.
<p>2.&nbsp;<span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Important Remaining
Tasks</span><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span>
<p>Significant work remains to create an environment that permits full
and fair competition among registrars in .com, .net and .org.
<p><i>a. NSI and ICANN must reach agreement on the terms under which NSI
fulfills its obligation to recognize ICANN</i>
<p>NSI specifically agreed in Amendment 11 to the Cooperative Agreement
to enter into a contract with the not-for-profit corporation recognized
by the United States Government pursuant to the White Paper, and agreed
that the corporation would have the authority to carry out its responsibilities
under the White Paper. The purpose of the recognition requirement in Amendment
11 is twofold: first to obligate NSI to follow through on its public commitment
to cooperate with and participate in the implementation of the White Paper;
and second, to ensure that NSI's activities as a registry and as registrar
would be subject to rules emerging from the consensus based, bottom-up
process spelled out in the White Paper.
<p>It is worth briefly summarizing the relevant provisions of Amendment
11. Network Solutions agreed to recognize NewCo "when recognized by the
USG in accordance with the provisions of the Statement of Policy." (Purpose
clause). Network Solutions further committed to enter into a contract with
NewCo, and acknowledged "that NewCo will have the authority, consistent
with the provisions of the Statement of Policy and the agreement between
the USG and NewCo, to carry out NewCo's Responsibilities." (NewCo Clause).
Under Amendment 11, NewCo's Responsibilities specifically include the establishment
and implementation of DNS policy and the terms, including licensing terms,
applicable to new and existing gTLDs and registries under which registries,
registrars and gTLDs are permitted to operate." (Assistance to NewCo clause
and "Transition" Section of White Paper.)
<p>The key question, of course, is what the terms of the NSI-ICANN agreement
should be.
<p>With respect to NSI's provision of registry services - as to which an
unsupervised NSI would be able to exercise market power today and for the
foreseeable future - we believe the agreement must assure reasonable supervision
(similar to that under the Cooperative Agreement) to prevent the exercise
of that market power in a way that injures consumers. After all, the whole
purpose of the introduction of competition is to provide lower prices and
greater choice for consumers. Based on the principles of the White Paper
and Amendment 11 spell out the relevant principles. For example:
<ul>
<li>
<span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The operations of a registry
and of a registrar, if conducted by the same entity, should be separated
so revenues and assets of the registry are not utilized to financially
advantage registrar activities to the detriment of other registrars.</span></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The price to be paid by registrars
for each domain name registration to the registry should reflect demonstrated
costs and a reasonable rate of return.</span></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Access to the registry should
be provided on a non-discriminatory basis.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><br>With respect to NSI's provision of registrar services, robust competition
in the provision of registrar services - and the lower prices and greater
choice that attend such competition - cannot occur until all purveyors
of those services abide by the same rules.<sup><a href="#N_19_"> (19)</a></sup>
<p>We believe that the appropriate rules for registrars are embodied in
the ICANN Accreditation Agreement. Of course, there is always room for
improvement and a number of stakeholders have made good suggestions for
fine-tuning the Accreditation Agreement, which we continue to consider
and discuss with ICANN as they are received. For example, in response to
a comment from the intellectual property community that the Accreditation
Agreement should require registrars to conduct a reasonable degree of screening
of registration data, to bolster the quality of data in WHOIS, ICANN revised
the Accreditation Agreement to require registrars to abide by any later-adopted
policies related to the verification of contact information.<sup><a href="#N_20_">
(20)</a></sup>
<p>NSI has not, to date, executed an Accreditation Agreement nor agreed
to provide registrar services in accordance with the substantive provisions
of that agreement. We understand that NSI's objections fall into three
categories: first, NSI asserts that ICANN has not been "recognized" by
the Commerce Department and thus NSI is not obligated under Amendment 11
to execute any agreement with ICANN; second, NSI believes that ICANN Accreditation
should be limited to an evaluation of the business and financial capacity
of an applicant to be a registrar; and third, NSI objects to specific terms
in the Accreditation Agreement.
<p>With respect to the first objection, NSI has asserted that the MOU did
not constitute "recognition" of ICANN. As we understand it, NSI's position
appears to be that such recognition will not take place until the Department
of Commerce transfers authority (as opposed to operational responsibility)
over the root server system to ICANN. The White Paper contemplated a gradual
transition to private sector management to ensure stability, and transfer
of authority over the root would necessarily come at the end of any transition.
Moreover, the transition described in the White Paper necessarily depends
on NSI's early cooperation. To clear up any misunderstanding, the Department
subsequently issued a letter to NSI specifically recognizing ICANN for
purposes of Amendment 11.<sup><a href="#N_21_"> (21)</a></sup>
<p>NSI has stated repeatedly that the ICANN Accreditation Agreement should
be limited to an evaluation of the business and financial capacity of a
would-be registrar. Indeed, previous Department efforts to facilitate a
contractual agreement between NSI and ICANN were unsuccessful in late March
of 1999 because NSI insisted that it would not enter into any contract
with ICANN that did not specifically preclude the existence of separate
contracts between ICANN and the Accredited Registrars. NSI proposed, instead,
that ICANN should enter into a contract with NSI as registry, in which
NSI would agree to "flow through" the substantive provisions of the Accreditation
Agreement to Accredited Registrars. We understand NSI's position to be
that this architecture reflects a more orderly contract hierarchy and avoids
the possibility of conflicts between the terms of NSI's relationship with
Accredited Registrars and the terms of ICANN's relationship with Accredited
Registrars.
<p>We agree that the "flow through" of terms from ICANN to NSI as registry
and then to Accredited Registrars might, in some sense, be perceived to
be more orderly. However, the architecture proposed by NSI undermines the
fundamental premise of the White Paper -- that the DNS should be managed
by the private sector based on voluntary contractual undertakings among
interested stakeholders. In addition, this architecture interposes NSI
between ICANN and the Accredited Registrars affected by ICANN policy development,
in effect giving NSI a veto over any ICANN developed policy relating to
registrars in .com, .net and .org. If, for example, ICANN were to promulgate
a policy supported by consensus and developed in accordance with transparent
and fair processes, as required by the ICANN bylaws, meaningful implementation
of that policy would be entirely up to NSI. The absence of contracts between
ICANN and its Accredited Registrars also removes any mechanism whereby
ICANN and Accredited Registrars could provide for the payment of registrar
user fees. Presumably such fees would instead come from the registry, giving
NSI considerable leverage over ICANN's finances. Nothing in the White Paper
or Cooperative Agreement contemplates that NSI is to have such control.
<p>We understand that NSI's objections to specific provisions of the Accreditation
Agreement flow from a concern about creeping regulatory authority. We note
that the scope of ICANN's authority is bounded by its bylaws, which set
out the purpose of the corporation, the processes it must follow when pursuing
these goals, and the need for consensus on the specific approach adopted
to pursue these goals. We also believe that antitrust law also constrains
ICANN policy development to that which is reasonably necessary to achieve
the legitimate goals of the corporation, in a manner that is no broader
than necessary to achieve those goals.
<p>Nonetheless, we believe it would be constructive to have a clearer articulation
of the limits of ICANN's authority. For these reasons we have urged the
Board to assure registrars and registries, including NSI, through contract,
that ICANN will restrict its policy development to matters that are reasonably
necessary to achieve the goals specified in the White Paper, in accordance
with the principles of fairness, transparency and bottom-up decision making
articulated in the White Paper. This commitment would, in effect, give
all who enter into agreements with ICANN a contractual right to enforce
safeguards that are now contained in the ICANN bylaws and in the antitrust
laws of the United States.
<p>We are also prepared to discuss any other concerns that NSI has with
the terms of the existing Accreditation Agreement.
<p>NSI has also publicly stated that ICANN's rules should apply to all
similarly situated top level domains - which is to say ccTLDs that do not
require a meaningful connection to the jurisdiction associated with the
TLD or the registrant's agreement to submit to and be bound by the courts
of that jurisdiction (so-called "Open ccTLDs"). There may be some merit
to this view, and it deserves further consideration. Open ccTLDs potentially
provide competition for .com, .net and .org and thus their coverage could
become a basic fairness issue at some point, although currently registrations
in .com, .net and .org dwarf registrations in even the most popular ccTLDS,
whether open or closed. Moreover, we believe that the smooth operation
of the Internet will be enhanced by greater clarity about what rules apply
in a given situation. The White Paper strongly endorsed the principle,
however, that national governments should continue to have policy authority
over their ccTLDs. Thus, the United States has initiated discussions within
the ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) in an effort to secure
international, governmental support for the proposition that Open ccTLDs
should be subject to the same rules applicable to gTLDs. This process will
take time, however, and its outcome is not under ICANN's control. It therefore
provides no basis for an interim exemption of .com, .net, and .org from
policies developed in accordance with the White Paper.
<p>The hardest, and most important, task we face at this point is to create
an atmosphere of greater trust and cooperation in implementation of the
White Paper. The Department of Commerce believes that all interests will
be served by eliminating the level of inflammatory rhetoric being currently
displayed on all sides. The stakes here are too great - nothing less than
allowing the Internet to realize its full potential as a vehicle for comment,
education, and commerce. We all must put aside parochial concerns and work
toward that end.
<p>We have been able to reach agreement with NSI in the past each time
it has been necessary to do so in order to enable the DNS process to move
forward. There is no reason to believe that agreement cannot be reached
on the remaining questions. Our discussions with NSI are ongoing, and we
are hopeful that they will advance to a satisfactory resolution on a timely
basis.
<p>What if an agreement cannot be reached?
<p>NSI's view is very clear. Its position is that when the Cooperative
Agreement terminated, whether prematurely or upon its expiration on September
30, 2000, NSI will be free to operate these domains without any supervision
by the Government:
<li>
to charge whatever registration fee it wishes</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
to discontinue accepting registrations from competing registrars</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
to decide whether, and on what terms, to make WHOIS and zone file data
available to intellectual property owners seeking to fight piracy, and
to anyone else</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
to decide whether or not to provide a dispute resolution system for trademark
infringement</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
to unilaterally determine how the .com, .net, and .org functions are managed
globally</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
to decide whether or not registrants should pay for a domain name before
it is activated</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
to decide whether domain names are registered on a first-come, first-served
basis, or on some other basis<sup><a href="#N_22_"> (22)</a></sup></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The Commerce Department believes just as strongly that NSI does not
have the legal right to operate these domains as it wishes in the authoritative
root in perpetuity. We believe that the functions now performed by NSI
under the Cooperative Agreement could be reassigned through a recompetition
of those tasks. Upon such reassignment, NSI would cease to have any legal
right to provide either registry or registrar services in the authoritative
root, unless it won the competition - and provided those services under
the terms of the new agreement - or provides registration services through
an agreement with ICANN.
<p>More fundamentally, from a policy perspective, NSI's position has disturbing
implications for the future of the Internet:
<ul>
<li>
Will companies be willing to continue to invest in new Internet applications
if entry to the only commercially relevant domains is under the unsupervised
control of one company?</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Will intellectual property firms be willing to digitize their content and
distribute it over the Internet if their ability to combat piracy depends
on the unsupervised decision of one company about whether to make available
information about the location and ownership of web sites?</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Will companies be willing to invest in new trademarks, or bring existing
marks to the Internet if their ability to effectively enforce their trademark
rights rests in the unsupervised discretion of one company?</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Will companies be willing to invest in new technology that could enhance
the Internet if the decision to deploy such technology rests in the unsupervised
discretion of one company?</li>
</ul>
Even if the Department of Commerce did not intervene to prevent this result,
we believe it is very clear that other countries would step in to impose
limitations on NSI. During the comment process that culminated in the issuance
of the White Paper, other governments were very forceful with respect to
the need to introduce real competition and impose constraints on NSI. Without
an appropriate outcome in the present negotiations, we believe NSI would
quickly become a target of action by other countries in order to protect
consumers against the exercise of monopoly power.
<p>For these reasons, we think it clear that - one way or the other - NSI's
provision of registry and registrar services will eventually be subject
to reasonable standards, spelled out in the White Paper and in Amendment
11, to ensure the full and fair competition that will lead to lower prices
and greater consumer choice. Obviously, failure to reach agreement with
ICANN, recompetition of the Cooperative Agreement, and the likely results
that would follow, together with action by other governments, will be extremely
destabilizing for the Internet and therefore quite harmful to its development.
We therefore believe that it is in everyone's interest - the Internet community,
NSI, ICANN, and the United States to resolve these issues amicably, reasonably,
and in a manner that promotes the consensus policy goals of the White Paper.
We plan to do everything we can to reach that result.
<ul>
<li>
<i>The Commerce Department and NSI must agree on a post-Testbed license
for use of the SRS by Accredited Registrars</i></li>
</ul>
As discussed above, the Commerce Department and NSI have not yet reached
agreement on a post-Testbed license for use of the SRS. Following are the
principal issues under discussion:
<ul>
<li>
The SRS requires all registrants in .com, .net and .org to register a domain
name for an initial two-year term. The Department of Commerce believes
that, at a minimum, NSI should provide a one-year registration option to
allow registrars to compete for business on the basis of different term
lengths.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Under the SRS, transfer of a domain name from one registrar to another
has the effect of terminating the remainder of an existing registration,
and requiring registrants to pay for a new two year term. Thus, if a consumer
elects to change registrars six months into an existing registration contract,
he or she gets no credit for the remaining 18 months of the existing registry
entry, despite his or her previous payment for a full two-year term. Rather,
a new two year fee must be paid to NSI upon transfer. We are very concerned
that imposing this monetary penalty on transfers of existing registrations
among registrars creates a barrier to robust competition. The Department
believes transferring registrants should not be required to forfeit their
existing term, but rather should pay a transfer fee. Such a fee, in our
opinion, should be cost based and should be low enough to facilitate growth
of robust competition without encouraging "slamming."<sup><a href="#N_23_">
(23)</a></sup></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
NSI and the Department have not agreed on a registration price that reflects
NSI's costs and a reasonable return on investment, as called for in Amendment
11. These discussions are continuing.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Registrars accredited for the Testbed and for the post-Testbed period have
indicated that the current transfer procedures are cumbersome and will
discourage consumer choice. Procedures must be developed that facilitate
consumer choice and competition without creating "slamming" problems.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
The requirement of a performance bond in the amount of $100,000 has presented
problems for registrars based outside the United States and for registrars
with non-traditional business models. We are exploring with NSI flexible
alternatives to the performance bond that provide adequate financial assurances
to back up the indemnification provisions in NSI's License and Agreement
with Accredited Registrars.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Accredited Registrars have expressed concern about NSI's assertion of rights
under the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) in the NSI License and Agreement.
That NDA contains a standard exclusionary clause for, among other things,
information in the public domain, prior known information, and independently
developed information. Notwithstanding this exclusion, NSI has informed
Testbed Registrars participating in a Registry Testbed Mail List that "all
information included in [postings to the list] is subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement . . . and may not be sent to any third party . . . without the
express prior written consent of Network Solutions."<sup><a href="#N_24_">
(24)</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
NSI has indicated that in the post-Testbed period, personnel resource limitations
will permit the company to support the addition of new registrars at the
rate of only five per month. We are concerned that this pace will delay
the onset of full competition.<sup><a href="#N_25_"> (25)</a></sup></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
The Testbed period is providing important information about the competitive
implications of NSI's continued participation in the system as both an
exclusive provider of registry services and as a competing registrar in
.com, .net and .org. For example, NSI's public affairs office (which serves
both the registry and the registrar) announced the volume of registration
activities conducted by one of the Accredited Registrars participating
in the Testbed. NSI agrees that it should not have announced the business
information of another party without its permission, and has taken steps
to correct the problem, but this action raised questions about how to assure
that information held by the registry is not shared with NSI as registrar
to the detriment of fair and open competition.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>c. <i>Data and Competition Issues</i>
<p>In February and March of this year, NSI implemented certain substantive
changes in its provision of registration services. These actions, which
have competitive implications, have not been resolved on a permanent basis.
<ul>
<li>
First, NSI denied bulk access to information in the .com, .net and .org
zone files for any purpose other than caching. (NSI later agreed to permit
bulk downloads for trademark searches.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Second, NSI blocked the date creation field in the WHOIS database and attempted
to make access to all information in the WHOIS database subject to a license
prohibiting any commercial use of the data.</li>
</ul>
These actions were taken without the consent of the Department of Commerce.<sup><a href="#N_26_">
(26)</a></sup> Zone file and WHOIS data had been freely available to the
Internet community for years. Numerous people have built legitimate businesses
that enhance the Internet using WHOIS and zone file data, which was compiled
by NSI while it operated under the authority of the United States Government,
through the Cooperative Agreement, as the exclusive provider of registry
and registrar services in the .com, .net and .org gTLDs. The White Paper
specifically endorsed the continued availability of that data to "anyone
who has access to the Internet."
<ul>
<li>
Third, NSI directed all traffic addressed to <a href="file:////NTIANT1/htdocs/ntiahome/domainname/www.InterNic.net">www.InterNic.net</a>
to its own registration page at <a href="file:////NTIANT1/htdocs/ntiahome/domainname/www.netsol.com.">www.networksolutions.com.</a>
Again, this was done without notice to or the authorization of the Department
of Commerce. Internic is a registered servicemark of the U.S. Government.
Its operation is at the heart of the Cooperative Agreement. NSI's decision
to direct would-be domain name registrants directly to its own web page,
one month before competition was to be introduced, was extremely troubling
to the Department.</li>
</ul>
The Department and NSI have reached temporary resolutions of some of these
issues.<sup><a href="#N_27_"> (27)</a></sup> NSI restored the date creation
field of WHOIS, pending further dialogue on "privacy considerations and
operational risks associated with the display of a registrar's record creation
date." We have yet to receive requested information on the operational
risks that are the basis of NSI's concerns. Most troubling was NSI's statement
that it wanted specifically to block competing registrars access to the
date creation field to prevent "harassment" of registrants; that information
obviously would be useful to new entrants seeking registration renewal
business from the more than five million existing registrations. NSI's
commitment to display the date creation field expired on May 1. NSI has
assured us only that it would not change the present functionality of WHOIS
without informing us. NSI continues to assert a right to limit commercial
use of the WHOIS data, over the Department's objections.
<p>NSI agreed to provide free bulk access to zone file data until July
23, 1999, under the terms of a Department of Commerce-approved agreement
that would prohibit objectionable uses such as spamming but would allow
all other lawful uses. The Department has asked the root server operators
not to make this data available during the study period, and all of the
operators have agreed.<sup><a href="#N_28_"> (28)</a></sup> The Department
of Commerce has not received information requested on the operational risks
that form a basis for NSI's concerns about access to zone file data.
<p>NSI has now sought the Department's approval to effectively segregate
zone file data for .com, .net and .org from the root servers and to house
it on servers exclusively within NSI's control. The proposal is now under
careful review. The NSI proposal has not been accompanied by any commitment
to continue to make zone file data readily available to those with legitimate
uses, including the Department of Commerce under the Cooperative Agreement,
or a commitment regarding Department of Commerce supervision of the zone
files pursuant to the Cooperative Agreement.
<p>Finally, NSI agreed to create a page at&nbsp;<span STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">www.internic.net</span></span>
containing information explaining that competition among registrars in
.com, .net and .org was coming. We were rather disappointed that NSI's
implementation of this agreement involved a page that dissolved, in short
order, to the NSI homepage. We expected a distinct web page with a link
to NSI's homepage. Now that competing registrars are online, we have reiterated
our view that a query to <a href="file:////NTIANT1/htdocs/ntiahome/domainname/www.InterNic.net">www.internic.net</a>
should resolve to a page at a separate website with hot links to competing
registrars, and we have offered to operate that page. For this change to
be fully implemented, NSI may have to rewrite some registration templates
used by some of its bulk resellers. Nonetheless, we think that InterNIC
is, and should remain, a neutral designation and should be used to educate
the public about the introduction of competition in domain name registration.
It should not be used to point registration requests to one registrar on
a preferential basis. In addition, the Department of Commerce believes
that further consideration should be given to use of the InterNIC site
to provide access to a comprehensive WHOIS database.
<p>D.&nbsp;<span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Domain Names and Trademarks</span>
<p>The White Paper included a lengthy discussion of what was referred to
as the "trademark dilemma." The White Paper concluded, on the basis of
substantial public input, that the smooth running of the DNS system and
continued growth of the Internet required the development of systems to
provide trademark holders with the same rights they have in the physical
world, to ensure transparency, and to guarantee efficient dispute resolution
mechanisms for certain categories of disputes. The specific policies recommended
in connection with intellectual property/DNS conflicts include:
<ul>
<li>
that specific, up-to-date information, be collected from domain name registrants
and be made available to anyone with access to the Internet.</li>

<li>
that domain name registrants pay registration fees at the time of registration
or renewal and agree to submit to the authority of a court of law in specified
jurisdictions.</li>

<li>
that domain name registrants agree, at the time of registration or renewal,
to submit to and be bound by alternative dispute resolutions systems in
cases involving cyberpiracy or cybersquatting.</li>

<li>
that domain name registrants agree, at the time of registration or renewal,
to abide by processes designed to prevent certain famous trademarks from
being used as domain names by anyone other than the holder of that famous
mark.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
The White Paper also indicated that the U.S. Government would seek international
support to call upon the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
to initiate a balanced and transparent process to develop recommendations
for reducing and resolving trademark/domain name disputes.
<p>The WIPO report issued in April 1999, is the product of nearly a full
year of work involving public meetings in fourteen<span STYLE="COLOR: red"></span>different
countries, based on input from 344 commenters.<sup><a href="#N_29_"> (29)</a></sup>
It also draws on extensive work done by WIPO prior to June 1998, as well
as consensus reflected in the White Paper.
<p>ICANN anticipated a substantial portion of the WIPO recommendations
related to pre-payment and the need for up-to-date registrant contact information
(most of which were identified in the White Paper as well), and addressed
these recommendations in the Accreditation Guidelines, which, as previously
mentioned, were the subject of public consultation by ICANN in February
of this year. ICANN acted on the remainder of the WIPO recommendations
by (1) embracing the concept of a uniform administrative dispute resolution
procedure for cybersquatting (a concept that was specifically recommended
in the White Paper) and calling on the DNSO to report on implementation
of these recommendations in advance of the August Board meeting, and (2)
referring the WIPO recommendations on protections for famous marks to the
DNSO for further study.
<p>The referral to the DNSO is appropriate under the ICANN Bylaws, which
require policy consensus development to be conducted on a bottom-up basis.
We note, however, that both the White Paper process and the WIPO process
demonstrated nearly universal support for a uniform dispute resolution
policy for cybersquatting. Inasmuch as competing registrars are already
entering the system, such procedures must be developed quickly. We are
thus especially pleased that a group of ICANN Accredited Registrars are
working together on their own to develop a uniform dispute resolution policy
that will incorporate the WIPO recommendations.
<p>E.&nbsp;<span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Management of the Root
Server System</span><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span>
<p>The first principle of the White Paper, stability, requires the U.S.
Government to transition the management of the Internet name and number
addressing system in a manner that insures the stability of the Internet.
We are committed to introducing new private sector management without disrupting
current operations or splitting the Internet through creation of competing
root systems. The White Paper called for the United States to undertake,
in cooperation with IANA, NSI, the Internet Architecture Board and other
relevant organizations from the public and private sector, a review of
the root server system to recommend means to increase the security and
professional management of the system.
<p>Many are concerned that as the Internet has grown, operation of the
root server system has remained <i>ad hoc</i>, in that it continues to
be administered by "volunteers" who are not bound by any legal obligation
to work together. We note that the so-called "volunteers" are, in fact,
extremely reputable and highly skilled networking specialists who have,
over the years, demonstrated an ability to work cooperatively and under
tremendous pressure to ensure the stability of the root server system.
<p>The Department of Commerce and ICANN have entered into a Cooperative
Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to fulfill the White Paper mandate
and carry out one of the objectives in the MOU with ICANN -- to increase
the security and professional management of the system.<sup><a href="#N_30_">
(30)</a></sup> We also note the creation within the IETF of a working group
on this matter. To this end, we are collaborating on the development of
written technical procedures for operation of the primary root server and
for making the root server system more robust and secure. This initiative
represents an important first step in the creation of formalized relationships
for administration of the Internet root system.
<p>Currently, NSI manages the authoritative or "A" root server at the direction
of the Department of Commerce. The Cooperative Agreement provides that
(1) all changes to the "A" root must be approved by the Department and
(2) NSI will transfer management of the root to ICANN or an alternative
entity upon receipt of written instructions.
<p>The White Paper and the MOU also specifically contemplate transfer of
root administration to ICANN. The Department and ICANN are discussing transfer
of operational responsibility (but not policy authority) for the "A" or
authoritative root server to ICANN. These discussions are informed on an
ongoing basis by input from ICANN's Root Server Advisory Committee, in
which NSI participates.
<p>We stress that these conversations are preliminary. The prerequisites
for any such transfer include (1) the existence of a technical management
plan that ensures the secure and stable operation of the authoritative
root and (2) a binding contractual obligation on the part of ICANN to operate
the authoritative root server at the direction of the United States government.
ICANN is currently developing a technical management plan. In May, 1999,
ICANN drafted a "Root Zone Management Agreement" for discussion purposes.
To the extent that it is consistent with the security and stability of
the Internet, the Department will seek private sector input on the plan,
when developed.

<p>****************************************</center>

<p>For ease of reference, the questions contained in your June 22 letter
appear in italics, and the responses in plain text below. Pursuant to an
agreement with the Committee's staff, requested documents will be provided
under separate cover on July 12, 1999.
<p><i>1. As stated above, it has been reported that during the most recent
ICANN board meeting in Berlin last month, the interim board threatened
to terminate the authority of NSI to continue registering domain names
if NSI fails to enter into a registrar accreditation agreement with ICANN
by June 25, 1999. Regarding this reported exchange during ICANN's board
meeting:</i>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Did a member of ICANN's interim board threaten to terminate the authority
of NSI to continue registering domain names if NSI fails to enter into
a registrar accreditation agreement with ICANN by June 25, 1999? If so,
please identify the interim board member in question.</i></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<i>Why did the NTIA official present at the meeting fail to discourage
such a drastic measure by ICANN?</i></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<i>Does ICANN currently possess the authority to terminate the authority
of NSI to register domain names?</i></li>
</ul>
</ul>
Mr. George Conrades did ask a Network Solutions representative, David Johnson,
if he had stated that Network Solutions "would never" sign an accreditation
agreement, as several participants in the registrar constituency meeting
had reported. Following Mr. Johnson's response, which was contested by
several participants, Mr. Conrades indicated that if Network Solutions
did not sign an accreditation agreement it would not be a registrar. ICANN
does not have the authority to terminate NSI's "authority" to continue
registering domain names, and Mr. Conrades did not assert that ICANN had
such authority. We believe that this exchange reflects the frustration
and lack of trust described above. We have urged ICANN to avoid further
exchanges of this sort.
<p>Representatives of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA) and the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) attended the ICANN open
meeting in Berlin on May 25-27, 1999. The United States Government's participation
in
these meetings is generally limited to observing, in keeping with our commitment
to private, bottom-up decision-making.Becky Burr, Acting Associate Administrator
for International Affairs, NTIA, responded to a specific question on this
topic from Mr. Conrades, declining to comment on his views, but indicating
that Amendment 11 clearly contemplates that Network Solutions will need
to be accredited at some date in the future and that signing an accreditation
agreement with ICANN is at present the only way to become an Accredited
Registrar. She made no statement about what would happen if Network Solutions
refused to enter into a contract with ICANN. In subsequent public meetings,
Ms. Burr has indicated that ICANN has no authority to limit NSI's registration
activities. It should be noted that ICANN staff and Board members have
also affirmatively indicated that they do not possess such authority.
<p>ICANN does not possess the authority to terminate the authority of NSI
to register domain names. NSI provides DNS registration services pursuant
to a Cooperative Agreement with the United States Department of Commerce.
In that Agreement, NSI agreed to recognize ICANN's authority and to become
accredited pursuant to a contract with ICANN.
<p>NSI has indicated during discussions with the Commerce Department that
it believes that the United States Government does not have the authority
to terminate Network Solutions' ability to register domain names. The Commerce
Department believes that it does have the legal authority to terminate
provision of registrar and/or registry services in the authoritative root
by NSI by recompeting the relevant portions of the Cooperative Agreement.
These services then would be provided by the winner of the competition
(which could be NSI, if it were the winner and were willing to comply with
the provisions of the revised Cooperative Agreement). Network Solutions'
contrary view, of course, would mean that Network Solutions could manage
the .com, .net, and .org domains in perpetuity without any oversight or
supervision by the US Government.
<ul>
<li>
<i>2. Did ICANN consult with the Department of Commerce regarding ICANN's
decision to impose a $1 per domain registration fee?</i></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Did the Department of Commerce conduct any legal analysis relating to
ICANN's authority to impose a $1 per domain name fee? If the Department
of Commerce did conduct such a legal analysis, please provide all records
relating to the aforementioned legal analysis. If the Department of Commerce
did not conduct such a legal analysis, please provide a detailed legal
analysis of ICANN's authority to impose a $1 per domain name fee, including
but not limited to the following questions:</i></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<i>Is it the legal opinion of the Department of Commerce that ICANN is
legally empowered to impose such a fee?</i></li>

<li>
<i>If so, does ICANN derive the authority to impose a $1 per domain name
fee from its MOU with the Department of Commerce?</i></li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<i>Does the Department of Commerce approve of ICANN imposing such a fee?</i></li>
</ul>

<p><br>The Department of Commerce received advance copies of the Registrar
Accreditation Guidelines, posted for comment by ICANN on February 8, 1999,
and discussed them with ICANN counsel.
<p>Department staff asked ICANN counsel how both the fixed and variable
portions of the fees were derived, and how those fees related to ICANN's
overall budget process, described in the bylaws. We were informed that
ICANN intended to establish fees using the budget process, and to collect
such fees via contractual arrangements with registrars, registries and
others, as appropriate.
<p>The Department of Commerce did not conduct a detailed legal analysis
of ICANN's authority to impose the $1 fee as such fee was not designed
to collect funds for government use. As discussed above, Commerce Department
staff did direct certain inquiries to ICANN's counsel regarding the fees.
<p>It is, however, the Department of Commerce's view that ICANN is legally
empowered to impose such a fee. OMB Circular A-25, ICANN recognizes that
ICANN, as a project partner with the Department of Commerce, can recover
its cost of participating in a joint project, but only the actual costs
associated with its participation in the joint project. Thus, the Department
has no objection to ICANN's recovery of costs associated with the joint
project, provided that only joint project expenses are recovered and no
profits obtained.
<p>The Department also believes that such a fee would be consistent with
the White Paper and the MOU between the Department and ICANN. The White
Paper called upon the private sector to create a new, not-for-profit corporation,
funded "by domain name registries, regional IP registries, or other entities
identified by the Board." Under the MOU between the Department and ICANN,
ICANN is required to defray it own expenses. The ICANN bylaws require the
Board to set fees and charges, subject to rigorous procedural safeguards
also set out in the bylaws, "with the goal of fully recovering the reasonable
costs of the operation of the Corporation and establishing reasonable reserves
and contingencies reasonably related to the legitimate activities of the
Corporation. Such fees and charges shall be fair and equitable, and once
adopted shall be published on the Web Site in a sufficiently detailed manner
so as to be readily accessible." (Bylaws, Section 4.(b)).
<p>Nonetheless, as indicated above, we believe that ICANN should eliminate
this fee until the election of board members from the SOs. Our recommendation
in this regard reflects the practical judgment that this important decision
should not be made until elected members are present on the Board. It does
not reflect a legal judgment that the fee is unauthorized or unlawful.
<p><i>3. A detailed legal analysis of:</i>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<i>The Department of Commerce's authority to empower ICANN;</i></li>

<li>
<i>The nature and scope of oversight authority available to the Department
of Commerce under its MOU with ICANN; and</i></li>

<li>
<i>Whether the Department of Commerce's cooperative agreement with NSI
requires NSI to sign a registrar accreditation agreement with ICANN.</i></li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
</ul>
The Department has authorized ICANN to participate in DNS management activities
in two separate agreements. On November 25, 1998, following consultation
with the private sector and with other governments, the Department of Commerce
entered into a joint project agreement with ICANN. Under the agreement,
ICANN and the Department are collaborating to design, develop and test
mechanisms for private sector management of DNS. To enter into this agreement,
each party identified its mission authority to participate in these activities.
Just as the Department has statutory authorization to accomplish this mission,
ICANN is also chartered in its articles of incorporation and bylaws to
pursue DNS management activities.
<p>Most of the Department's work with ICANN falls under the joint project
agreement. As discussed below, however, the Department has entered a CRADA
with ICANN and intends to enter into a separate contract whereby ICANN
will perform key Internet technical coordinating functions (collectively
known as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions), currently
performed under a contract between the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) and the University of Southern California (USC). Pursuant
to these agreements, ICANN is authorized to participate in the Government's
DNS management activities.
<p>DARPA and NSF, as well as other Federal agencies, in accordance with
their missions, have all participated and maintained a central role in
the development and management of the DNS. Through contracts, cooperative
agreements, and other transactions, the United States Government has conducted
research, development, and technical management of the DNS. The White Paper
sets forth the principles that govern the exercise of the U.S. Government
involvement in this area. As set forth in the White Paper, the Department
of Commerce is continuing this management role by entering into agreements
with ICANN.&nbsp;<span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Department of Commerce
has broad authority to foster, promote and develop foreign and domestic
commerce. 15 U.S.C. &sect; 1512. Moreover, the National Telecommunications
and Information Administration is specifically authorized to coordinate
the telecommunications activities of the Executive Branch and assist in
the formulation of standards and policies for these activities, including,
but not limited to, considerations of interoperability, privacy, security,
spectrum use and emergency readiness. 47 U.S.C. &sect; 902 (b)(2)(H).&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Department's Joint Project
Authority, 15 U.S.C. &sect; 1525, permits the Secretary of Commerce to
enter into agreements with research organizations, non-profit entities
and public agencies to conduct joint projects on matters of mutual interests,
provided that the costs are equitably apportioned. The Department sought,
and has achieved, a relationship whereby the joint project partner can
test the mechanisms for private sector management of the DNS, including
those addressed in the White Paper.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ICANN's responsibility under
the joint project agreement is to act as the not-for-profit entity contemplated
in the White Paper, and to demonstrate whether such an entity can implement
the goals of the White Paper. If it cannot, Government involvement in DNS
management would likely need to be extended until such time as a reliable
mechanism can be established to meet those goals. The Department does not
oversee ICANN's daily operations. The Department's general oversight authority
is broad, and, if necessary, the Department could terminate the agreement
and ICANN's role in this aspect of DNS management with 120 days notice.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The White Paper stated that
the private sector come together to create a non-profit corporation to
ultimately manage the DNS functions. Despite press reports to the contrary,
the Department did not create, and does not control ICANN. The Department
did not draft corporate by-laws for ICANN nor select members of its board
of directors. The Department did suggest that ICANN work with the Internet
community to resolve concerns raised by ICANN's initial proposal to the
Department in response to the White Paper. The Department has been careful
not to interfere in the internal affairs of ICANN. The Department's general
oversight under the joint project is limited to ensuring that ICANN's activities
are in accordance with the joint project MOU, which in turn requires ICANN
to perform its MOU tasks in accordance with the White Paper.&nbsp;</span>
<p>At the time that the Department and Network Solutions entered into Amendment
11 of the Cooperative Agreement, the Department had not recognized the
new, not-for-profit corporation called for in the White Paper. For this
reason, the Amendment refers to "NewCo" as the "not-for-profit corporation
described in the Statement of Policy and recognized by the USG in accordance
with the provisions of the Statement of Policy for so long as the USG continues
its recognition of NewCo." (General Definition of NewCo clause.)
<p>Network Solutions agreed, in Amendment 11, to recognize NewCo "when
recognized by the USG in accordance with the provisions of the Statement
of Policy." (Purpose clause.) Network Solutions further committed to enter
into a contract with NewCo, and acknowledged "that NewCo will have the
authority, consistent with the provisions of the Statement of Policy and
the agreement between the USG and NewCo, to carry out NewCo's Responsibilities."
(NewCo Clause.) Under Amendment 11, NewCo's Responsibilities specifically
include the establishment and implementation of DNS policy and the terms,
including licensing terms, applicable to new and existing gTLDs and registries
under which registries, registrars and gTLDs are permitted to operate."
(Assistance to NewCo clause and "Transition" Section of White Paper.)
<p>Network Solutions has indicated that it is not obligated to enter into
a contract with ICANN because the Department of Commerce has not "recognized"
ICANN by transferring authority over the authoritative root system to it.
We find no merit in this argument. The Department of Commerce entered into
a Memorandum of Understanding with ICANN on November 25, 1998. That MOU
constitutes the Government's "recognition" of ICANN. We reiterated this
point in a letter to Network Solutions on February 26, 1999. When Network
Solutions signed Amendment 11 on October 7, 1998, no one contemplated that
either "operational responsibility" (let alone "authority") over the Internet
root would be transferred outside the United States Government in the short
term. Under the White Paper, the Government proposed to "gradually transfer
these (coordination) functions to the new corporation . . . with the goal
of having the new corporation carry out operational responsibility by October
1998." (White Paper Section 4.) Moreover, in Amendment 11, NSI agreed "to
continue to function as the administrator for the primary root server for
the root server system and as a root zone administrator until such time
as the USG instructs NSI in writing to transfer either or both of these
functions to NewCo or a specified alternate entity." (Root Servers Clause)
This administrative function specifically provided "NSI to process any
such changes (additions or deletions to the root zone file) directed by
NewCo when submitted to NSI in conformity with written procedures established
by NewCo and recognized by the USG." (Same)
<p>Amendment 11 unambiguously contemplates a contract between NSI and ICANN
under which NSI will recognize that ICANN has the authority to carry out
its responsibilities under the White Paper and ICANN will accredit NSI
as a registrar and registry. These parties have not yet reached agreement
on the terms of that contract. As we have discussed, we believe it is clear
that the terms must be consistent with the policies set forth in the White
Paper and, in particular, with the policy mandating robust competition
in the provision of registrar services.
<p>As discussed above, we have every hope that these parties will be able
to reach agreement. We plan to do everything we can to facilitate such
an agreement.
<p><i>4. Records of all communications (whether written, electronic or
oral) between the Department of Commerce (or its agents or representative</i>s)
<i>and
ICANN (or it agent or representatives), including but not limited to all
records relating to such communications, regarding:</i>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Negotiations or other discussions regarding the transfer of control
of the root system to ICANN or an ICANN-affiliated entity</i></li>

<li>
<i>Negotiations or other discussions regarding future agreements relating
to the DNS between ICANN and the Department of Commerce) excluding records
of communications provided in response to request 4.a. above)</i></li>

<li>
<i>The terms of ICANN's registrar accreditation agreement, including but
not limited to the imposition of the $1 per domain name registration fee</i></li>

<li>
<i>Termination or alteration of the Department of Commerce's cooperative
agreement with NSI; and</i></li>

<li>
<i>Attempts to persuade or force NSI into entering a registrar accreditation
agreement with ICANN, or NSI's refusal to enter into the aforementioned
agreement.</i></li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
The Department of Commerce has no intention of transferring control over
the root system to ICANN at this time. We have had preliminary conversations
relating to ICANN's operation of the authoritative root under terms and
conditions similar to those by which the A root is operated by NSI currently.
<p>The MOU and the CRADA constitute the only existing agreements between
ICANN and the Department of Commerce.
<p>With respect to future agreements, two are currently contemplated:
<p>The Department has developed a sole source contract/request for proposal
<sup><a href="#N_31_">(31)</a></sup>
for ICANN's provisions of a limited number of purely technical services,
previously provided under a contract between DARPA and the University of
Southern California's Information Sciences Institute (ISI). An initial
notice was posted in
<i>Commerce Business Daily
</i>on January 4, 1999,
as required under 41 U.S.C. 253 (Federal Procurement Regulations).<span STYLE="COLOR: red"></span>In
response to public input, the CBD notice was revised and reposted on February
9, 1999. The proposed contract does not authorize ICANN to make any substantive
changes in existing policy associated with the performance of the IANA
functions. No protests or expressions of interest were received in response
to the revised CBD Notice. We are currently awaiting a technical and business
proposal from ICANN as well as various representations and certifications
required under federal procurement statutes and regulations.
<p>If and when the Department of Commerce transfers operational responsibility
for the authoritative root server for the root server system to ICANN,
an separate contract would be required to obligate ICANN to operate the
authoritative root under the direction of the United States government.
As discussed above, these obligations would mirror the obligations under
which NSI currently operates the A root server.
<p>As discussed above, Department staff reviewed and commented on advance
copies of the Registrar Accreditation Guidelines. Department staff suggested
certain changes in the guidelines, and urged ICANN to include a series
of questions designed to elicit public input on the matters addressed.
ICANN staff implemented this and other suggestions. Department staff also
facilitated a meeting between ICANN and NSI to discuss NSI's objections
to the terms of the Accreditation Guidelines and the Accreditation Agreement.
The Department also received, and conveyed to ICANN, input from members
of the intellectual property community with respect to the Agreement. In
both cases, ICANN revised its Accreditation Agreement based on the input
received.
<p>In February and March of this year, Commerce Department staff attempted
to facilitate the NSI and ICANN contract negotiations. These discussions
focused on two agreements, one relating to NSI's registrar activities,
and one relating to NSI's activities as the registry for .com, .net and
.org. Although some progress was made in the course of these informal discussions,
NSI's refusal to consider any arrangement that permitted the existence
of a contractual relationship between ICANN and ICANN Accredited Registrars
effectively ended the effort at that time.<i> </i>NSI and Department staff
are currently engaged in intensive discussions on the subject of the ICANN/NSI
relationship.

top level domains (ccTLDs) that might have been expected to provide some
competition. But relevant data indicate that the ccTLDs have not yet presented
a serious challenge to the commercial dominance of the gTLDs. For example,
