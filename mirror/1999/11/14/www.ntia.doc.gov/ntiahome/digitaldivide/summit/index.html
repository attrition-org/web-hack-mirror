<P>Information tools, such as the personal computer and the Internet, are increasingly critical to
economic success and personal advancement.  In early July, the National Telecommunications
and Information Administration issued a report, <EM>Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital
Divide</EM>, that found a growing gap between those with access to these tools and those without.  As
information technology plays an ever-increasing role in Americans' economic and social lives,
the prospect that some will be left behind in the information age can have serious repercussions. 
The digital divide threatens to impede the health of our communities, development of a skilled
workforce, and the economic welfare of our nation.

<P>On December 9, 1999, the Secretary of Commerce will host a Digital Divide Summit, focused on 
expanding access to information technologies for underserved populations and areas.  Secretary Daley
will lead the dialogue among participants from the Federal Government, technology industry,
civil rights and non-profit communities, grassroot community organizations, and the general
public.  The participants will examine existing public and private initiatives aimed at closing the
technology gap and will discuss how to expand upon and coordinate these efforts.  Closing the
digital divide is an essential part of President Clinton's <EM>New Markets Initiative, </EM>which seeks to
bring America's prosperity to economically-underserved areas.

<P>The Summit will be held at the Department of Commerce and will include
an address by Secretary Daley;  a roundtable discussion with representatives
from the public and private sectors; and six breakout sessions.  The topics
of these smaller sessions include Technology and Economic Development in
Underserved Areas;  Sustainable Public Access Points;  Lowering Barriers to
Access through New Product Development;  Marketing to and Content for
Underserved Populations;  Rural Communities -- Targeted Solutions; and
Workforce Development -- Training and Education.

<P><A HREF="register.html">Registration materials are available on-line</A>.
Please indicate on the materials the breakout session you wish to attend.
In addition, space is provided at the end of the registration materials if
you would like to share a description of activities you are undertaking or
ideas you have to address the digital divide.
You can also raise questions or concerns that relate to this topic.
We will collect and distribute these
ideas and questions to Summit participants.
