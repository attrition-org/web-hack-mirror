<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, for this opportunity
to report on progress towards transitioning management of the Internet
domain name system ("DNS") to the private sector.
<p>The Commerce Department's Statement of Policy on the <i><a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">Management
of Internet Names and Addresses</a></i> (the "White Paper"), issued thirteen
months ago, identified a number of tasks to be undertaken on a priority
basis in order to transition DNS management to the private sector:
<br>(1) private sector creation and organization of a new, not-for-profit
corporation to conduct DNS management; (2) rapid introduction of competition
in the provision of domain name registration services; (3) adoption of
policies to reduce conflicts between trademark holders and domain name
registrants; and (4) review of the root server system to increase the security
and professional management of that system.
<p><u>Creation and Organization of New Corporation</u>
<p>The <a href="http://www.icann.org/">Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (ICANN)</a> has made considerable progress toward establishing
the structures for representative decision making contemplated in the White
Paper, but there is still important work to be done:
<ul>
<li>
ICANN's top priority must be completing the work necessary to put in place
an elected board of directors on a timely basis. Specifically, it must
do everything within its power to establish the Supporting Organizations,
and ensure the election of nine board members by those Organizations to
begin serving at the November 1999 Board Meeting. And it must work diligently
to complete the process for electing at-large directors by June 2000.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
ICANN should eliminate the $1 per-year per domain name registration user
fee. Although the user fee may be determined to be an appropriate method
for funding ICANN's activities, it has become controversial, and we believe
a permanent financing method should not be adopted until after the nine
elected members are added to the ICANN Board in November. That will ensure
that this important decision is made in accordance with the representative,
bottom-up process called for in the White Paper. In the meanwhile, we will
work with ICANN and the entire Internet community, to the extent permitted
by law, to obtain interim resources for ICANN.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
ICANN should immediately open its board meetings to the public. Transparency
is critical to establishing trust in decision making. And trust is essential
for ICANN's ultimate success. As a general matter, ICANN has undertaken
the vast majority of its work in an open and transparent manner. The final
step of opening the board meetings is critical to establishing trust in
ICANN.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
There is concern in the Internet community about the possibility of over-regulation,
and therefore ICANN should assure all registrars and registries, through
contract, that it will restrict its policy development activities to matters
that are reasonably necessary to achieve the goals specified in the White
Paper and that it will act in accordance with the procedural principles
set forth in the White Paper.</li>
</ul>
With these actions, and the other steps already taken by ICANN, we believe
that ICANN will put itself on a very firm footing to achieve the goals
and principles spelled out in the White Paper. The ICANN apparently agrees
and <a href="http://www.icann.org/correspondence/icann-to-doc-19july99.htm">wrote
to the Department of Commerce on July 19, 1999</a> indicating that these
suggestions would be implemented.
<p><u>Introduction of Competition in Domain Name Registration</u>
<p>Again, there has been considerable progress: the Shared Registration
System (SRS) has been created; new registrars have been accredited under
guidelines established by ICANN; <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/">Network
Solutions, Inc. (NSI)</a> has licensed the SRS to those registrars on an
interim basis; and testing of the SRS has begun. But significant work still
remains to be done in order to establish robust competition:
<ul>
<li>
NSI must fulfill its obligation to recognize ICANN as required by <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/docnsi100698.htm">Amendment
11 of the Cooperative Agreement</a>. This requires NSI and ICANN to reach
agreement on a number of contractual issues. The transition of DNS management
to the private sector can succeed only if all participants in the domain
name system - including NSI - subject themselves to rules emerging from
the consensus based, bottom-up process spelled out in the White Paper.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
With respect to NSI's provision of registry services - as to which an unsupervised
NSI would be able to exercise market power today and for the foreseeable
future - we believe the NSI-ICANN agreement must assure reasonable supervision
to prevent the exercise of that market power in a way that injures consumers.
With respect to NSI's provision of registrar services, robust competition
in the provision of those services - and the lower prices and greater choice
that are the benefits of competition - cannot occur until all purveyors
of those services abide by the same rules.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
But what if an agreement cannot be reached? NSI's view is very clear. Its
position is that when the Cooperative Agreement terminates, whether prematurely
or upon its expiration on September 30, 2000, NSI will be free to operate
these domains without any supervision by the Government. The Commerce Department
believes just as strongly that NSI does not have the legal right to operate
these domains in the authoritative root in perpetuity. We believe that
all or part of the functions now performed by NSI under the Cooperative
Agreement could be reassigned through a competition and, unless NSI won
the competition, it would cease to have any legal right to provide the
recompeted services. And even if that were not so, an NSI unconstrained
under U.S. law would quickly become a target of action by other countries
in order to protect consumers against the exercise of market power.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
This path - failure to reach agreement with ICANN, recompetition of the
Cooperative Agreement and the likely results that would follow, together
with action by foreign governments - would be extremely destabilizing for
the Internet and therefore quite harmful to its development. We have been
able to reach agreement with NSI in the past each time it has been necessary
to do so in order to enable the DNS process to move forward. There is no
reason to believe that agreement cannot be reached on the remaining questions.
We believe all parties should put aside inflammatory rhetoric, set aside
parochial concerns, and work for a fair solution that is in the interest
of the entire Internet community.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
NSI and the Department of Commerce must reach agreement on a post-Testbed
license for registrars' use of the SRS. Remaining issues include modification
of the SRS to allow registrars to offer different term lengths (and thus
compete on this basis in addition to price); and allowing registrants to
switch registrars without forfeiting the time remaining on an existing
registration contract, upon payment of a cost-based transfer fee (the current
system requires the transferring registrant to forfeit all time on its
existing registration and pay an additional two-year fee). We are very
concerned that imposing this monetary penalty on transfer of existing registrations
among registrars creates a barrier to robust competition. We also must
reach agreement on the size of the per-registration fee to be paid to NSI
as registry.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
NSI and the Department of Commerce also must resolve issues regarding the
availability of the WHOIS database, and the .com, .net, and .org zone files.
NSI took certain actions earlier this year without the consent of the Commerce
Department that restricted access to this information, which had previously
been widely and readily available to the Internet community. We strongly
support the prohibition of uses that adversely affect the operational stability
of the Internet, but we oppose other restrictions on third-party use of
this information, which has been compiled by NSI in the course of its operations
under the authority of the U.S. Government.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The Commerce Department and NSI also must reach agreement concerning the
appropriate use of the InterNIC.net website. The Commerce Department believes
that InterNIC should remain a neutral website for the purpose of educating
the public about the introduction of competition in domain name registration
and possibly for providing a comprehensive WHOIS service.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
Domain Names and Trademarks
<ul>
<li>
The provisions of the ICANN <a href="http://www.icann.org/registrars/accreditation.html">Accreditation
Agreement</a>, together with the <a href="http://wipo2.wipo.int/process/eng/processhome.html">recommendations
of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)</a> when fully implemented,
reflect the recommendations of the White Paper related to reducing friction
between trademark owners and domain name holders. We commend ICANN for
its prompt action on these issues, and urge it to proceed promptly, pursuant
to the appropriate ICANN procedures, to establish a uniform dispute resolution
procedure for cybersquatting.</li>
</ul>

<p><br><u>Management of the Root Server System</u>
<ul>
<li>
The Department of Commerce and ICANN are proceeding to implement the White
Paper's call to develop and implement means to increase the security and
professional management of the Internet root server system.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
I want to thank the Committee for inviting me to testify today on this
important issue. We have attached our <a href="../domainname/blileyrsp.htm">response
to Chairman Bliley's letter of June 22, 1999</a> which discusses these
issues in greater detail. As always, the Department of Commerce welcomes
the Committee's interest in the DNS process. I would be pleased to answer
any questions you may have at this time.
