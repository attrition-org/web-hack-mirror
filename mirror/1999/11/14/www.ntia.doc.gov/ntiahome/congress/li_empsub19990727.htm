<p>TESTIMONY OF LARRY IRVING
<p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION
<p>NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION (NTIA)
<p>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
<p>ON
<p>THE DIGITAL DIVIDE: BRIDGING THE TECHNOLOGICAL GAP
<p>BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON EMPOWERMENT
<p>COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS
<p>U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
<p>JULY 27, 1999</center>

<hr SIZE="3">
<br>Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:
<p>Thank you for this opportunity to testify today on the findings of <i><a href="../digitaldivide/index.html">Falling
Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide</a> </i>("<i>Falling Through
the Net</i>"), the study on the "digital divide" authored by the Department
of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA). Today, I would like to describe the key findings of this new study.
I have also attached to my testimony copies of slides that I will be presenting
in my oral testimony before the Subcommittee.
<p>President Clinton and Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley released
<i>Falling Through the Net</i> on July 8, 1999, during the Administration's
New Markets tour through the United States. During this tour, the President
and Secretary Daley discussed the fact that, even though information technology
underlies much of our nation's economic growth, too many Americans are
left out of the digital economy. <font face="Times New Roman">As a result,
the digital divide -- that is, the divide between the so-called information
"haves" and "have nots" -- has become one of the critical economic and
civil rights issue of this decade.</font>
<p>Access to new technologies, such as the computer and the Internet, will
be key to the future economic success of American businesses, communities,
and individuals. <font face="Times New Roman">To begin with, the Internet
is becoming an important tool for personal success and professional advancement.
Increasingly, Americans are using it to find jobs, contact colleagues,
locate public information, or take courses online. Familiarity with new
technologies will also prepare more Americans for the high-tech workplace
of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Equally important, access to new technologies
has become critical to the success of small businesses. Electronic commerce
is increasingly helping small companies and entrepreneurs in rural, remote,
and traditionally underserved areas. It is enabling small businesses to
connect with a global market, find cheaper products, and sell to buyers
worldwide. In addition, new technologies, such as the Internet and high-speed
telecommunications networks, are allowing many companies to expand to new
regions, supporting the development of new businesses and creating new
jobs in many economically depressed areas.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of the increasingly important role
of new technologies, Secretary Daley has concluded that "[e]nsuring access
to the fundamental tools of the digital economy is one of the most significant
investments our nation can make." As we enter the 21<sup>st</sup> century,
it will become even more essential to ensure that <i>all</i> Americans
-- whether rich or poor, urban or rural, Hispanic or Black -- can reap
the benefits of these new technologies.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Falling Through the Net</i>: Defining
the Problem</font></b>
<p><i>Falling Through the Net:</i> <i><font face="Times New Roman">Defining
the Digital Divide</font></i> provides a key starting point in bridging
the gap between the nation's information rich and poor. It serves as an
important
<font face="Times New Roman">diagnostic tool to help determine
which Americans have access to new technologies, and which do not. The
report therefore provides an important factual basis for policymakers and
the private sector to formulate ways to provide greater access for more
Americans.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is NTIA's third report documenting
household access to telephones, computers, and the Internet. The <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html">first
report</a>, released in July 1995, was a landmark subscribership study
of U.S. households. The study received much attention and provided important
empirical findings for the Administration and other policymakers seeking
to assure that no Americans are being left behind in the emerging Information
Age. A <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/net2/">successor study</a>,<i>
</i>released in July 1998, documented the rapid growth of PC penetration
and online activity in US households, and underscored the widening "digital
divide" between the so-called information "haves" and "have nots."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The new study, </font><i>Falling Through
the Net:</i> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Defining the Digital Divide</i>,
expands on the previous two reports. In addition to documenting connectivity
among households, the study includes valuable new information on how people
are gaining access to the Internet; how Americans choose to spend their
time online; and why some people are not connected.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As with the previous two reports, </font>NTIA
utilized data from the U.S. Department of Commerce Census Bureau. NTIA
contracted with the Census Bureau to add questions to its December 1998
"Current Population Survey" ("CPS") on household penetration, specifically
to formulate a Computer and Internet Use Supplement survey. The Census
Bureau obtained data on these surveys by interviewing 48,000 sample households
across all fifty states. This survey asked additional questions regarding
points of Internet access, methods of access, types of use, and reasons
for discontinuing use, among other topics.
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Key Findings from <i>Falling Through
the Net</i></font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Overall, the study presents much good news:
more Americans are connected today than ever before. Computer ownership
has nearly doubled in four years, and Internet access has increased more
than 40 percent in the last year. More than one-quarter of American households
have Internet access at home and approximately one-third of Americans are
going online from some point. Additionally, those who were less likely
to have telephones (chiefly, young and minority households in rural areas)
are now more likely to have phones at home.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">The Growing Disparities</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Nevertheless, there is also some very troubling
news. To begin with, there is a persisting "digital divide" between the
information rich (such as Whites, Asians/Pacific Islanders, those with
higher incomes, those more educated, and dual-parent households) and the
information poor (such as those who are younger, those with lower incomes
and education levels, certain minorities, and those in rural areas or central
cities).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The new data reveal significant disparities,
including the following:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman">Households with incomes of $75,000 and higher
are more than <i>twenty times</i> more likely to have access to the Internet
than those at the lowest income levels, and more than <i>nine times</i>
as likely to have a computer at home.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
College graduates are nearly <i>sixteen times</i> more likely to have home
Internet access than those with an elementary school education level, and
more than eight times as likely to have a computer. In rural areas, college-educated
households are more than <i>twenty-six times</i> more likely to have Internet
access.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman">Black and Hispanic households are approximately
<i>one-third</i> as likely to have home Internet access as households of
Asian/Pacific Islander descent, and roughly<i> two-fifths</i> as likely
as White households. Significantly, Whites are more likely to have access
to the Internet from home than Blacks or Hispanics have from <i>any</i>
location.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Those in rural areas, across all income levels, are less likely to have
Internet access than households of similar incomes in urban areas and central
cities. A low-income household in a rural area has a less than <i>one in
thirty</i> chance of having Internet access at home. A rural Black household
has less than a <i>one in thirteen</i> chance of having home Internet access.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman">Northeast central cities and the rural South
are lagging behind all other areas in household access to new technologies.
For computer ownership, Northeast central cities (30.4%) and the rural
South (34.6%) are well behind the national average (42.1%). The same is
true for home Internet access: 18.7% for Northeast central cities and 19.0%
for the rural South, compared to the national average of 26.2%.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps even more troubling, the digital divide
has <i>widened</i> in the last year as the information "haves" outpace
the "have nots" in gaining access to electronic resources. The following
gaps with regard to home Internet access are representative:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman">The gaps between White and Hispanic households,
and between White and Black households, are now more than six percentage
points larger than they were in 1997.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman">The digital divides based on education and
income level have also increased in the last year alone. Between 1997 and
1998, the divide between those at the highest and lowest education levels
increased 25 percent, and the divide between those at the highest and lowest
income levels grew 29 percent.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Times New Roman">Nevertheless, the news is not all bleak. For
Americans with incomes of $75,000 and higher, the divide between Whites
and Blacks has actually narrowed considerably in the last year. This finding
suggests that the most affluent American families, irrespective of race,
are connecting to the Net. If prices of computers and the Internet decline
further, the divide between the information "haves" and "have nots" may
continue to narrow.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">The Importance of Public Access Points</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Until every household can afford access
to information resources, it will be important to provide access to computers
and the Internet outside the home through public access points. </font>The
data in <i>Falling Through the Net</i> demonstrate that schools, libraries,
and community centers are particularly well used by groups that lack access
to new technologies at home and at work. The following examples are illustrative:
<ul>
<li>
Blacks who use the Internet outside the home are nearly twice as likely
to use a public library or a community center for access than Whites.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Americans earning less than $20,000 are more than twice as likely to get
Internet access through a public library or a community center.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
People without college degrees are also significantly (1.4 times) more
likely to use these access points than those with college degrees.</li>
</ul>
Promoting public access points and training programs are, therefore, essential
steps to connecting American communities. The data also demonstrate that
people who use libraries and other access points are also proportionately
more likely than other groups to use the Internet to take courses and find
jobs. An investment in such programs is therefore an investment in the
economic, professional, and personal growth of hundreds of thousands, if
not millions, of Americans.
<p>Solving the digital divide will involve both government and private
sector efforts. Government programs, such as <font face="Times New Roman">NTIA's
<a href="../../otiahome/tiiap/index.html">Telecommunications
and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP)</a>, are already
expanding access to technological resources to underserved areas. TIIAP
provides matching grants to non-profits and public entities serving underserved
populations through new technologies. The program has helped support such
programs as the Mountain Association for Community Economic Development,
which is providing technological resources to promote entrepreneurship
in rural communities </font>in Kentucky.
<p>The assistance of non-profit organizations and private industries is
also necessary a necessary component in expanding access to new technologies.
<font face="Times New Roman">Industry has already come forward with significant
assistance. Companies are supporting the creation of community technology
centers, helping connect schools through "NetDays," and donating computers
and software to schools and neighborhood centers. The private sector's
contribution is essential because these companies know what kinds of skills
Americans will need in order to find jobs in the future.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Additionally, community-based organizations
can help provide access to computers and the Internet where communities
need it most. Each community knows best how to reach and connect its residents,
whether it is through traditional community centers, churches, housing
projects, senior centers, museums, fire and police stations, Boys and Girls
Clubs, or other centers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">These efforts - on the part of industry,
community organizations, and government -- are all necessary to providing
additional access points for those without Internet access at home. They
will provide Americans with the skills they need to compete in the high-tech
workplace and to find new business opportunities. Only with through these
continued, combined efforts can we reach our goal of enabling all Americans
to participate in the digital economy.</font>
