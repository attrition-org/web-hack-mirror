<p>STATEMENT OF KELLY KLEGAR LEVY
<br>ACTING ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR
<br>OFFICE OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND DEVELOPMENT
<br>NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION (NTIA)
<br>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
<p>BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON
<br>TELECOMMUNICATIONS, TRADE, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION
<br>COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE
<br>U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
<p>SEPTEMBER 30, 1999</center>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:
<p>Thank you for this opportunity to testify this morning, setting forth
the views of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA) with respect to H.R. 1746, the Schools and Libraries Internet Access
Act. NTIA serves as a <a href="../ntiafact050698.htm">principal
adviser to the President</a>, Vice President, and Secretary of Commerce
on domestic and international telecommunications and information policy
issues and has been an active participant in the schools and libraries
support process.
<p>The Administration shares your goal of providing advanced telecommunications
services to schools and libraries. Both President Clinton and Vice President
Gore have made connecting schools and libraries to the nation's information
infrastructure one of their highest priorities. The importance of enabling
schools, including classrooms, and libraries to access the Internet, in
conjunction with an integrated, well-developed curriculum, cannot be overstated.
As the President stated: "Until every child has a computer in the classroom
and the skills to use it . . . until every student can tap the enormous
resources of the Internet . . . until every high-tech company can find
skilled workers to fill its high-wage jobs . . . America will miss the
full promise of the Information Age." Once viewed with curiosity, the information
revolution has brought fundamental changes to the fabric of society and
to the foundations of the emerging global economy.
<p>In June 1999, the Department of Commerce released <i><a href="http://www.ecommerce.gov/ede/">The
Emerging Digital Economy II</a></i>, a report that demonstrated the increasingly
pivotal role that information technologies play in our economy and the
dramatic growth of electronic commerce. In July 1999, the Department of
Commerce released <i><a href="../digitaldivide/index.html">Falling
Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide</a></i>, a report examining
which American households have access to key information tools - telephones,
computers, and the Internet - and which do not. Overall, we found that
more Americans than ever before own computers and are online. At the end
of 1998, over 40 percent of American households owned computers, and almost
one-quarter of all households had Internet access.
<p>Yet, <i>Falling Through the Net</i> also documented that there remains
a significant digital divide separating American information "haves" and
"have nots." Indeed, in many instances, the digital divide has widened
in the last year. Certain minorities, low-income persons, the less educated,
and children of single-parent households, particularly when they reside
in rural areas or central cities, are among the groups that lack access
to information resources. Because access to computers and the Internet
is increasingly critical to successful participation in our digital economy,
we need to ensure that everyone has access to these technologies.
<p>One of the interesting findings of <i>Falling Through the Net</i> is
that community access centers - such as schools, libraries, and other public
access points - are particularly well used by those groups that lack access
at home or at work. For example, Hispanics and American Indians/Eskimos/Aleuts
are especially likely to use schools for access if they live in rural areas.
Households with incomes less than $25,000, those with less than a high-school
education, those in female-headed households, and American Indian/Eskimos,
Aleuts, Blacks, and Hispanics who have low Internet access rates at home
are relying with a great deal of frequency on public libraries for access
to the Internet.
<p>Thus, the <i>Falling Through the Net</i> data underscore the importance
of efforts by Congress, as well as the Administration, to ensure that all
schools and libraries have affordable access to the Internet on sustained
basis. The Administration strongly supported Section 254(h) of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996, which established the E-rate program as part of the overall
Universal Service Fund. And the Administration has supported full funding
of that program. Under the E-rate program, telecommunications carriers
are providing eligible schools and libraries with a discounted rate for
telecommunications services, internal connections among classrooms, and
Internet access. As a result, the E-rate program is helping to connect
<font face="Times New Roman">schools and libraries at a very rapid pace.
In the first year of the program, 640,000 classrooms were connected to
the Internet. This year, $2.25 billion is available to connect an expected
528,000 additional classrooms. Eighty percent of public schools and fifty
percent of public libraries participate in the E-rate program. Importantly,
the E-rate program gives priority for funding to poor and rural schools
and libraries.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, the E-rate monies are proving
to be a catalyst for other efforts to connect schools and libraries to
online resources. Many states and communities are combining the Federal
E-rate funds with state and/or private sector money to address access problems.
In Louisiana, for example, $500,000 in E-rate funding received by the State
Library of Louisiana combined with $2 million in state funding and $7 million
from the Gates Library Foundation will enable the state library to provide
Internet access and computers for every library in the state. While just
three years ago many parts of Louisiana were entirely cut off from the
Internet, now every library in the state has computers and Internet access,
which are available for free to all 4.3 million residents.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The American public joins us in strongly
supporting the E-rate program. As information technology becomes increasingly
important in our global economy, Americans have come to overwhelmingly
support the need for computers in our nation's classrooms and libraries.
A non-partisan poll commissioned by EdLiNC found that 87 percent of respondents
support the mission of the E-rate program. The public's support of the
E-rate program is echoed by parent and teacher groups, library organizations,
high-tech companies, many telecommunications providers, and civil rights
groups.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">On July 30, 1999, the Fifth Circuit Court
upheld the structure of the E-rate program, including coverage for Internet
access and connections to the classroom as well as telecommunications services,
and upheld the Federal Communications Commission's authority to target
discount levels to the schools and libraries with greatest needs. Now with
the court case behind us, we hope that this program can achieve its full
potential.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Mr. Chairman, NTIA shares your concern
that the schools and libraries program be administered expertly, efficiently,
and impartially. However, we see no need for new legislation to change
the E-rate program in order to bring the full promise of the Information
Age to our children. Congressional oversight, including input from the
House Commerce Committee, and a two-tiered auditing process have helped
to ensure that the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) is running
the E-rate program efficiently, and that schools and libraries are using
E-rate money to fund only eligible services. Moreover, the E-rate program
is part of Universal Service - a program that, for the vast majority of
Americans, has worked well for over 60 years.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">H.R. 1746, the Schools and Libraries Internet
Access Act, would establish NTIA as the administrator of the universal
service program for schools and libraries as well as rural health care
providers. NTIA believes that it is premature to consider such a drastic
measure. First, we believe that third-party, non-governmental entities
have a commendable performance record in this regard. While the USAC may
have experienced some start-up difficulties, we believe that they have
taken the appropriate corrective actions. More time is needed to allow
the system to work. Second, in the new competitive environment, many believe
that the fund administrator must not advocate telecommunications policy
positions, a role that would be totally antithetical to, and incongruous
with, NTIA's existing statutory mandate. Third, as fund administrator,
NTIA would incur large start-up costs - costs that have already been incurred
by the USAC. In its current operating mode, NTIA does not possess the resources
or infrastructure to run the proposed E-rate grant program. While we feel
confident that we could administer the fund on an impartial basis and do
so in an accountable manner, these factors would not offset the above disadvantages.
In addition, the Administration, through a letter from the Office of Management
and Budget </font>to Chairman Tauzin, as well as to Senator Burns, also
raised significant budget issues on similar legislation before this subcommittee
last year.
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Aside from these issues, our greatest concern
is that any fundamental change in the administration of the E-rate program
will delay and forfeit opportunities for our children. Delay denies students
and teachers access to information and telecommunications technologies
and their benefits. Research shows that technology can enhance learning
opportunity and achievement, increase student motivation to learn, help
students acquire essential workplace skills, improve professional development
for teachers, and enable students to access high-quality education regardless
of time or place. As Vice President Gore has noted, "[f]or the very first
time in our history, it is now possible for a child in the most isolated
inner-city neighborhood or rural community to have access to the same world
of knowledge at the same instant as the child in the most affluent suburb."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Another recent Commerce Department report,
<i><a href="http://www.ta.doc.gov/reports.htm#USTPS">The Digital Work Force:
Building Infotech Skills at the Speed of Innovation</a></i>, stresses the
importance of expeditiously meeting the burgeoning demand for a highly-skilled
labor force. In testimony before the Congressional Joint Economic Committee,
such notables as Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, Bill Gates,
and many other leaders from the technology industry have testified not
only that technology has played a leading role in building and strengthening
our economy but also that the foundation for this growth is a quality education
for every student. If students - and others - cannot obtain the high-tech
skills and ready access to information that is critical for success in
the emerging digital economy, then our nation's ability to compete and
prosper will be put at risk. Particularly hard hit would be students at
the disadvantaged schools and libraries - those in low-income, rural, or
inner-city areas who likely would have to do without Internet access unless
universal service support is made available.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As Secretary of Commerce William Daley
has noted, "[t]omorrow's economy will demand technological literacy - the
E-rate is an important step to ensure that our economy grows strongly and
that in the future no one is left behind." During its evolution, the E-rate
program has already demonstrated its value, and the Administration continues
its strong support for the existing program and its goals. Thank you again
for the opportunity to testify.</font>
