<p>	Re:	Truth-in-Billing and Billing Format, CC Docket No. 98-170



<p>Dear Chairman Kennard:


<p>	I am writing to express our strong support for the pro-consumer goals that underlie the Commission's Truth-in-Billing
and Billing Format proceeding.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>  The pro-competitive policies of
the last several decades are transforming the telecommunications
marketplace into one in which consumers can select from an
expanding choice of traditional telephone service providers, as
well as new service offerings, including 900 services, wireless
communications, Internet access, and broadband residential
services.  As the Commission and other commenters have
articulated, current customer bills often contain vague,
misleading, confusing and even erroneous or fraudulent items.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
<p> 


<p>	The National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA) supports the Commission's efforts to ensure
that customers know exactly what they are paying for.  This
information is important and necessary to make competition work. 
Consumers will be better equipped to make informed buying choices
in an increasingly competitive market if they can easily
determine what services they receive, from whom, and at what
price.  Equally important, clear and simple bills should help
consumers to detect inappropriate charges resulting from either
billing error or fraud.  Consumers, for example, should have
sufficient information to detect slamming practices, involving an
unauthorized switch to a new long distance carrier, and to detect
cramming practices, involving charges for services not ordered or
received.  We also urge the Commission to expedite enforcement
actions against carriers that engage in slamming and cramming.


<p>	We applaud the Commission's expressed desire to work
collaboratively with the states, other federal agencies, consumer
groups, and the industry, toward billing reform.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>  The typical
bill covers a range of services that are intrastate, as well as
interstate in nature.  As a result, there is a legitimate
question about the Commission's jurisdiction to prescribe
regulations that would govern all facets of customers' bills. 
Also, the states, consumer groups, and the industry have
particular expertise that can contribute to this process.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>  NTIA,
therefore, encourages the Commission to work collaboratively with
these groups to develop improved billing policies and practices.


<p>	In addition, customers deserve accurate and concise
explanations of the items on their bills. NTIA therefore urges
the Commission to require all carriers who provide interstate
services or who bill charges resulting from federal regulatory
actions or statutes to comply with several specific measures. 
First, we agree with the Commission that carriers should be
required to describe briefly and accurately in writing the nature
of each charge on customers' bills.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  For each charge, the
identity of the service provider, as opposed to their billing
agent or bill aggregator soliciting payment, should be clearly
noted on customers' bills in a manner easily recognizable to the
subscriber.


<p>	Second, much customer confusion has resulted from the new
line items on customers' bills placed there by carriers. If
carriers choose to recover the costs of doing business through
such line items, the Commission should take measures to eliminate
the resulting customer confusion.  NTIA recommends that the
Commission create specific terms and definitions to identify and
explain each applicable line item on customers' bills, rather
than adopt the "safe harbor" approach proposed in this
proceeding.  NTIA's suggested approach will allow customers to
more easily compare applicable charges levied by different
competitors.  Appropriate line item labels and associated
descriptions should be based on the current record in this
proceeding and, if necessary, additional information gathered in
a further rulemaking.  While carriers should be required to use
the designated label and explanation for each line item, they
should be free to supplement Commission-mandated descriptions in
a manner that would provide greater clarity for the consumer.


<p>	Third, to help customers detect slamming or cramming
activities or other possible errors in their bills, carriers
should be required to highlight any changes in a bill, showing
both former and successive service providers, any new charges,
and changes in existing charges, by any appropriate means.  In
addition, carriers should be required to identify specific
charges on customers' bills for which non-payment will result in
termination of a particular service or services.


<p>	Finally, NTIA recommends that the Commission require subject
carriers to provide sufficient information with customer bills to 
enable customers to contact carriers directly with billing
questions, billing complaints, and for a further explanation of
specific charges.  Each subject carrier that seeks payment on a
customer's bill should be required to provide the service
provider's name, a business mailing address, a toll-free
telephone number, and, if available, a public e-mail address and
website location.


<p>	While NTIA advocates the adoption of a number of specific
billing requirements, we do not recommend that the Commission
require a specific bill structure or format specifications at
this time.  Consumers should receive adequate billing
information, without the imposition of excessively detailed
billing requirements that would be costly for both the industry
and customers alike.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  Thus, the Commission should give carriers,
either individually or collectively, a chance to develop better
organized bills that clearly explain charges, highlight changes,
specifically identify carriers seeking charges, and provide
adequate information on how to contact carriers when questions
arise.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>  At this stage, NTIA believes that carriers should be
free to choose whether, for example, to print descriptions of
charges on individual bills or provide this information as bill
inserts.  It may make sense for some carriers to use inserts now,
while adopting "printed on bill" descriptions after completing
bill printing modifications.  Other carriers might opt for bill
inserts to deliver descriptions in languages appropriate to their
customers.  NTIA believes that the Commission should give the
industry an opportunity to step forward now to develop specific
billing practices that result in more informed consumers.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> 


<p>	Ultimately, when consumers know what their fixed monthly,
per-minute, and percentage charges are, they will be in the best
position to make informed decisions and thus bring about the full
promise of competition.  Thank you for your consideration of
these views.


<p>							Sincerely,





<p>							Larry Irving
