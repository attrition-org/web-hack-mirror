<p><a NAME="EXECUTIVE"></a><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b></center>

<p>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
applauds the Commission for its efforts in providing additional spectrum
allocations for the development of mobile satellite services. It is expected
that the 2 GHz allocation will provide spectrum to meet the projected demands
of new entrants and existing mobile satellite service (MSS) providers.
NTIA would like to also commend the Commission on it efforts in implementing
the international Global Mobile Personal Communications by Satellite Memorandum
of Understanding (GMPCS MOU) which will support the deployment of GMPCS
service in the United States and around the world. As discussed in these
comments, NTIA remains concerned about a number of issues vital to the
future needs and operations of the Federal aeronautical radionavigation
community and implementation of the Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) and its constituent elements the United States Global Positioning
System (GPS) and the Russian Federation Global Navigation Satellite System
(GLONASS).
<p>The GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS) Signal Specification has
been amended in recognition that many civil GPS receivers utilize the entire
transmitted bandwidth of the Coarse/Acquisition code signal to minimize
tracking errors due to noise, interference, and multipath. NTIA requests
that the Commission modify Section 25.213(b) of its Rules to reflect the
amended SPS Signal Specification.
<p>NTIA recommends that the methodology established in Recommendation ITU-R
S.1342 be used for determining the coordination distance between aeronautical
radionavigation service (ARNS) Microwave Landing System (MLS) stations
and 2 GHz MSS feeder link earth stations operating in the 5091-5250 MHz
band. <font face="Times New Roman">NTIA also requests that the 2 GHz MSS
feeder link earth stations in the 5091-5250 MHz band be subject to the
standard process in which the Commission coordinates such applications
through the Frequency Assignment Subcommittee (FAS) of the Interdepartment
Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) to ensure that harmful interference between
MSS feeder links and Government operations is minimized.</font>
<p>Based on Recommendation ITU-R S.1340 and studies completed within the
International Telecommunication Union - Radiocommunications Sector (ITU-R),
NTIA recommends that the Commission limit the band requested for feeder
uplinks to the 15.43-15.63 GHz portion of the 15.4-15.7 GHz ARNS band.
Limiting the feeder links to this portion of the band will minimize impact
to existing ARNS systems, radio astronomy observations, and MSS feeder
link operations<font face="Times New Roman">. To facilitate the implementation
of feeder link earth stations, NTIA recommends that the methodology established
in Annex 3 of Recommendation ITU-R S.1340 be used for determining the coordination
distance between ARNS stations and 2 GHz MSS feeder link earth stations
operating in the 15.43-15.63 GHz band. NTIA further requests that the 2
GHz MSS feeder link earth stations in the 15.43-15.63 GHz band be subject
to the standard process in which the Commission coordinates such applications
through the Frequency Assignment Subcommittee (FAS) of the Interdepartment
Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) to ensure that harmful interference between
MSS feeder links and Government operations is minimized.</font>
<p>NTIA agrees with the Commission's proposal to require the 2 GHz MSS
operators to perform their Tracking, Telemetry, and Command (TT&amp;C)
functions within the assigned feeder link frequency bands. NTIA recommends
that to the extent practicable, 2 GHz MSS operators should locate their
TT&amp;C signal at the upper end of the 5091-5150 MHz band.
<p>NTIA recommends that the Commission adopt a wide band equivalent isotropically
radiated power (EIRP) limit of -70 dBW/MHz and a narrow band limit of -80
dBW on unwanted emission in the 1559-1626.5 MHz band for MSS mobile earth
terminals operating in the 1990-2025 MHz band. NTIA believes that these
unwanted emission limits will protect GNSS Category I operations and facilitate
GMPCS certification thru the harmonization of adopted international standards.
<p>NTIA proposes that the out-of-band emissions for 2 GHz MSS systems employing
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) techniques be averaged over a time
interval of duration that is equal to the length of the transmission time
slot. The basis for this proposal is that the Wide Area Augmentation System
(WAAS) transmits more data than GPS and thus has a symbol duration that
is 10 times shorter than a GPS data symbol, making it more susceptible
to long duration pulsed signals. For 2 GHz MSS systems employing Code Division
Multiple Access (CDMA) techniques, the 20 millisecond measurement interval
proposed by the Commission is appropriate.
<p>NTIA recommends that the carrier-off limit for a 2 GHz MSS mobile earth
terminal be 10 dB below the carrier-on limit to account for a cumulative
power effect. The cumulative effect is attributed to the significant majority
of MSS terminals in the carrier-off state.
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA believes that a user in need of emergency
assistance should receive help independent of which type of wireless device
that person is using. This should be independent of whether the network
is terrestrially based or satellite-based. Since the ability to locate
users in distress is in the public's best interest, NTIA supports the implementation
of position location capabilities for the 2 GHz MSS terminals authorized
for use in the United States.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA supports the Commission's proposal
that any 2 GHz MSS system authorized to operate inter-satellite service
links in the bands shared on a co-equal basis with Government operations
would be required to coordinate with the Government systems. NTIA recommends
that the Commission require that non-geostationary 2 GHz MSS licensees
operate their inter-satellite links in the 65-71 GHz band, which is proposed
to be reallocated for non-Government inter-satellite service.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA supports the Commission's tentative
conclusion that distress and safety rules should be adopted for 2 GHz MSS
systems<b>. </b>NTIA recommends that the Commission modify Section 25.143(f)
of the Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R. &sect; 25.143(f), to include the 1990-2025/2165-2200
MHz bands.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Priority must be given to Aeronautical
Mobile Satellite (Route) Service (AMS(R)S) traffic within MSS systems in
specific bands. At this time the only action needed is to strengthen the
existing ITU Radio Regulation footnotes addressing AMS(R)S priority and
preemption by including a requirement for AMS(R)S provision, and to complete
the ITU-R Working Document toward a Draft New Recommendation on MSS provision
of AMS(R)S.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Detailed discussion of the technical parameters
of Boeing's proposed Navigation Augmentation Service will be necessary
with the Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration
before NTIA could concur. These discussions are necessary to ensure that
interference is not caused to GPS.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to protect radio astronomy receivers,
the aggregate power flux density from all satellites in a constellation
employing the 10.7-10.95 GHz and 11.2-11.45 GHz band for feeder downlinks
will have to be at least -255 dBW/m<sup>2</sup>/Hz.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA requests that the 2 GHz MSS feeder
link operations in the 17.8-20.2 GHz band be subject to the standard process
in which the Commission coordinates such applications through the Frequency
Assignment Subcommittee (FAS) of the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee
(IRAC) to ensure that harmful interference between MSS feeder links and
Government operations is minimized.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA is concerned that the out-of-band
emissions from the 2 GHz MSS downlinks operating in the upper portion of
the 2165-2200 MHz could interfere with adjacent band Government space operations.
Moreover, interference to adjacent band Government space systems must be
taken into consideration when the Commission adopts power limits and out-of-band
emission limits for the 2 GHz MSS downlink band.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NASA recommends that ITU-R Recommendations
could be used in the development of policies and rules for the implementation
of MSS at 2 GHz. NASA believes that if care is taken in the initial design
phases of MSS systems that mutually satisfactory, interference-free operations
of both services is feasible.</font>

<center><b><font face="Times New Roman">COMMENTS OF THE NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Times New Roman">AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION</font></b></center>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The <a href="../../index.html">National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)</a>, an Executive
Branch agency within the Department of Commerce, is the President's principal
adviser on domestic and international telecommunications policy, including
policies relating to the Nation's economic and technological advancement
in telecommunications. Accordingly, NTIA makes recommendations regarding
telecommunications policies and presents Executive Branch views on telecommunications
matters to the Congress, the Federal Communications Commission, and the
public. NTIA, through the <a href="../../osmhome/osmhome.html">Office
of Spectrum Management</a>, is also responsible for managing the Federal
Government's use of the radio frequency spectrum. NTIA respectively submits
the following Comments in response to the Commission's Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking in the above-captioned proceeding.<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup></font>
<p><a NAME="I."></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">I. INTRODUCTION</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As a result of the 1992 World Administrative
Radio Conference (WARC-92), primary international allocations were adopted
for the 1980-2010 MHz (uplink) band and 2170-2200 MHz (downlink) band mobile-satellite
service (MSS) worldwide, and the 2165-2170 MHz band to MSS in Region 2<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup>
to be effective January 1, 2000.<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup> In 1994,
the Commission allocated portions of the international 2 GHz MSS allocation
specifically for domestic terrestrial mobile service use by Personal Communications
Services (PCS).<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup> Consequently, in 1995,
the United States sought additional international spectrum for 2 GHz MSS
at the 1995 World Radiocommunications Conference (WRC-95),<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup>
and WRC-95 adopted additional spectrum for 2 GHz MSS. Effective January
1, 2000, the 2010-2025 MHz (uplink) band and the 2165-2170 MHz (downlink)
band will be available for MSS in the United States and Canada. Effective
January 1, 2005, the 2010-2025 MHz (uplink) band will be available for
MSS in all of Region 2. In 1997, the Commission allocated the 1990-2025
MHz (uplink) and 2165-2200 MHz (downlink) bands to MSS in the United States.<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Following the allocation in 1997, the Commission
has received six applications and three letters of intent from non-U.S.
companies to provide 2 GHz MSS services in the United States. The 2 GHz
MSS applicants are the Boeing Company, Celsat, Constellation Communications,
Inc., Globalstar, L.P., Iridium LLC, and Mobile Communication Holding,
Inc. The companies seeking reservation of spectrum to serve the U.S. market
from non-U.S. licensed systems are ICO, Inmarsat Horizons, and TMI Communications
and Company, Limited Partnership. The nine 2 GHz MSS system proponents
propose a mixture of system designs (geostationary orbit and non-geostationary
orbit systems) as well as different modulation technologies (time division
multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), and, in some
cases, both TDMA and CDMA).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In this NPRM, the Commission is proposing
to use the MSS above 1 GHz (Big LEO) policies and rules<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup>
as a starting point for the development of policies and rules for the 2
GHz MSS. The Commission believes that this is a logical approach since
the issues are similar because the mobile satellite services proposed are
essentially the same as those provided by the Big LEOs <i>(i.e.</i>, voice,
data and fax via MSS), and because the proposed 2 GHz MSS system designs
are similar to those used by the Big LEOs (<i>i.e.</i>, CDMA and TDMA system
architectures). In addition, since several of the 2 GHz MSS system proponents
are proposing geostationary systems or geostationary components, the Commission
is also proposing to apply their</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">geostationary policies and service rules
where applicable.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to the service links, the 2
GHz MSS NPRM also addresses the feeder link frequency bands requested by
the 2 GHz MSS participants. Two of the frequency bands requested for 2
GHz MSS feeder links are allocated to the aeronautical radionavigation
service (ARNS) and used for safety-of-life operations.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA applauds the Commission for its efforts
in providing additional spectrum allocations for the further development
of mobile satellite services. The proposal for 2 GHz MSS systems, like
the other systems, promise to provide new and expanded regional and global
voice, data, and message services. It is expected that the 2 GHz allocations
will provide spectrum to meet the projected demands of new entrants and
existing MSS providers. NTIA would also like to commend the Commission
on it efforts in implementing the international Global Mobile Personal
Communications by Satellite Memorandum of Understanding (GMPCS MoU) which
will support the deployment of GMPCS service in the United States and around
world. These GMPCS systems will provide additional choices for delivery
of seamless voice, data, and broadband services for consumers in all parts
of the world. NTIA, however, offers the following comments to specific
issues raised in the 2 GHz MSS NPRM that NTIA believes will likely have
a direct and significant impact upon the future needs and operations of
the Federal aeronautical radionavigation community.</font>
<p><a NAME="II."></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">II. THE COMMISSION
SHOULD MODIFY ITS RULES TO REFLECT THE AMENDMENT TO THE SPS SIGNAL SPECIFICATION.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The bandwidth for the Global Positioning
System (GPS) is given as 1565.42-1585.42MHz.<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup>
In the third edition of the GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS) Signal
Specification, to be released later this year, the bandwidth for the GPS
Coarse Acquisition (C/A) code signal centered at 1575.42 MHz (L<sub>1</sub>)
has been amended as follows:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">The L-band SPS ranging signal
is a 2.046 MHz null-to-null bandwidth</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">signal centered on L1. The transmitted
ranging signal that comprises</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">the GPS-SPS is not limited to the null-to-null
signal and extends through</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">the band 1563.42 to 1587.42 MHz.<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></sup></font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">The SPS Signal Specification was amended in
recognition that civil GPS receivers utilize the entire transmitted bandwidth
of the C/A code signal to minimize tracking errors due to noise, interference,
and multipath. The power dispersed over the bandwidth of a GPS signal is
extremely important for high accuracy civilian safety-of-life applications
for two reasons. First, the achievable tracking accuracy (in terms of ranging
variance) of a signal is inversely proportional to the root-mean-square
(RMS) signal bandwidth. The implication is that the further the signal
power is dispersed from the carrier frequency, the more important it is
in reducing nominal tracking errors. Second, the most effective multipath
mitigation techniques for GPS rely on having a very sharp cross-correlation
(between the incoming C/A code signal and the receiver replica) function.
Sharpness of the cross-correlation function is provided by having a very
wide bandwidth to capture the signal power well beyond the first lobe of
the signal.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Since it is anticipated that many of the
civilian applications that demand a higher degree of accuracy, including
safety-of-life applications, will use the full transmitted bandwidth of
the GPS C/A code signal, NTIA requests that the Commission conform Section
25.213(b) of its Rules to the amended SPS Signal Specification.</font>
<p><a NAME="III."></a><font face="Times New Roman"><b>III. ITU-R RECOMMENDATIONS
SHOULD BE USED FOR ESTABLISHING COORDINATION DISTANCES BETWEEN ARNS STATIONS
AND MSS FEEDER LINK STATIONS IN THE 5091-5250 MHz BAND</b>.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Several of the 2 GHz MSS participants have
identified portions of the 5091-5250 MHz band for their feeder uplink spectrum.<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></sup>
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standard Microwave
Landing System (MLS) operates on 200 channels in the 5030-5091 MHz portion
of the band. MLS is an all weather precision approach and landing system
that supports navigation and guidance for suitably-equipped aircraft out
to a range of 43 kilometers and an altitude of 6096 meters. Within the
International Telecommunication Union-Radiocommunications Sector (ITU-R),
Recommendation ITU-R S.1342 has been developed and establishes a method
for determining coordination distances relative to current and planned

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commission is proposing to adopt out-of-band
emission limits for the 2 GHz MSS mobile earth terminals operating in the
1990-2025 MHz band that are the same as the limits proposed for the Big
LEO MSS mobile earth terminals operating in the 1610-1626.5 MHz band. The
Commission states that the proposed emission limits are intended to protect
certain aeronautical radionavigation operations and to facilitate GMPCS
certification. Specifically, in the 1559-1605 MHz portion of the 1559-1610
MHz band, the Commission proposes to adopt a wide band equivalent isotropically
radiated power (EIRP) limit of -70 dBW/MHz and a narrow band EIRP limit
of -80 dBW. In the 1605-1610 MHz portion of the band, the Commission proposes
to adopt limits of -70 dBW/MHz at 1605 MHz and -10 dBW/MHz at 1610 MHz
with the levels in between determined by linear interpolation. The Commission
seeks comment on whether any additional provisions may be appropriate or
needed concerning unwanted emissions.<sup><a href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The unwanted emission levels proposed by
the Commission for the 1559-1610 MHz band were developed specifically for
Big LEO MSS mobile earth terminals operating in the adjacent 1610-1626.5

susceptibility limits that will allow a Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) receiver, operating in the 1559-1605 MHz portion of the 1559-1610
MHz radionavigation satellite service (RNSS) band, to meet Category I accuracy
and continuity requirements for aeronautical radionavigation.<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup>
The GNSS consists of the U.S. GPS, the Russian Federation Global Navigation

<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA supports the unwanted emission limits
of -70 dBW/MHz (wide band) and -80 dBW (narrow band) in the 1559-1605 MHz
portion of the RNSS band as proposed by the Commission. However, the unwanted
emission limits proposed by the Commission in the 1605-1610 MHz portion
of the band represents a compromise that was reached between aviation and
Big LEO MSS communities. These limits are based on the practical out-of-band
emission levels that can be achieved by an MSS terminal operating in the
adjacent band.<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup> The reason that these
emission limits are applicable to Big LEO MSS terminals and not applicable
to 2 GHz MSS terminals is obvious. It is more difficult for MSS terminals
transmitting on assigned frequencies between 1610-1626.5 MHz to suppress
emissions in the 1559-1610 MHz than it would be for 2 GHz MSS terminals,
where a 380 MHz frequency separation exists. Since the filtering requirements
to suppress emissions in the 1559-1610 MHz are less stringent for 2 GHz
MSS terminals NTIA does not believe that the unwanted emission limits in
the 1605-1610 MHz portion of the band as proposed by the Commission are
appropriate.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, if it is the Commission's
intent to establish emission limits for 2 GHz MSS mobile earth terminals
that will facilitate GMPCS certification, it is important that harmonized
technical standards be established by all participating administrations.
The ITU-R has adopted a recommendation for licensing administrations concerning
regulatory limits on out-of-band emissions from MSS terminals licensed
for transmission to non-geostationary satellites in the frequency bands
between 1 to 3 GHz.<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup> For MSS terminals
operating in the 1980-2025 MHz band, the ITU-R recommendation specifies
an unwanted emission limit of -70 dBW/MHz in the 1559-1626.5 MHz band.
This ITU-R recommendation was developed to facilitate circulation of GMPCS
user terminals and the full implementation of the GMPCS.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The European Testing and Standards Institute
(ETSI) has also developed terminal essential requirements for MSS mobile
earth stations in the 2 GHz band. The ETSI standard specifies an unwanted
emission limit of -70 dBW/MHz in the 1559-1626.5 MHz band. This unwanted
emission limit would apply to MSS mobile earth terminals operating in the

TIME INTERVAL FOR UNWANTED EMISSIONS WILL DEPEND ON THE MODULATION TECHNOLOGY
EMPLOYED BY 2 GHz MSS MOBILE EARTH TERMINALS.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
has initiated plans to transition from its present ground-based navigation
and landing system to a satellite-based system. However, GPS alone will
not meet all aviation positioning requirements. To meet the National Airspace
System (NAS) requirements, the FAA has proposed two augmentations to GPS:
a Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) and a Local Area Augmentation System
(LAAS). The WAAS signal will provide the augmentation to GPS to obtain
the required accuracy improvement for precision approaches, as well as
integrity, continuity, and availability of navigation for all phases of
flight. A study performed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics
Laboratory (JHU/APL) concluded that GPS must be augmented to satisfy navigation
performance requirements and that the WAAS and the LAAS can provide the
required navigation performance.<sup><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup> The
JHU/APL study also considered interference to GPS and its augmentation
systems and recommended that regulations be developed for all licensed
transmitters that explicitly limit radio frequency emissions at satellite
radionavigation frequencies.<sup><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The out-of-band emission limits proposed
by the Commission are the average values to be measured over a 20 millisecond
(msec) time interval. The 20 msec time interval is related to the 50 symbols/sec
data rate of the GPS/GLONASS navigation message with a corresponding symbol
duration of 20 msec (1/50). However, the WAAS transmitted data stream has
a data rate of 500 symbols/second with a corresponding symbol duration
of 2 msec (1/500).<sup><a href="#N_22_">(22)</a></sup> As a result of the
shorter symbol duration, WAAS receivers are more vulnerable to disruption
by long duration pulsed signals. The longer duration pulses will overlap
more of the shorter duration WAAS symbols resulting in an increase in bit
error rate (BER) and the corresponding word error rate (WER) in the data
demodulation performed in GPS and WAAS (GNSS) receivers. An analysis was
performed that examined the BER and WER performance of GPS and WAAS receivers.<sup><a href="#N_23_">(23)</a></sup>
As shown in this analysis, a WAAS receiver is more susceptible to increases
in BER and WER than a GPS receiver.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The baseline data rate for WAAS is 250
bits/second. The data will be &frac12; rate convolutional encoded with
a Forward Error Correction (FEC) code. Therefore, the symbol rate that
the receiver must process is 500 symbols/second. The convolutional coding
for WAAS will be constraint length 7 as standard for Viterbi coding. WAAS
employs the convolutional code to partially make up for the degradation
in bit energy due to its faster data rate as compared to GPS. Pulses that
are longer than 2 msec will cause symbol erasures in the Viterbi decoder.<sup><a href="#N_24_">(24)</a></sup>
An erasure is a position in the demodulated sequence where the symbol value
is unknown, thereby increasing the BER. The effects on the convolutional
decoding will depend upon the nature of the pulsed signal (<i>e.g.</i>,
random, periodic, or other).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The 2 GHz MSS earth terminals proposed
for operation in the 1990-2025 MHz band will employ either CDMA or TDMA
multiple access techniques.<sup><a href="#N_25_">(25)</a></sup> For 2 GHz
MSS terminals employing CDMA, the level of unwanted emission are constant
over a nominal time period and the 20 msec measurement interval is adequate.
However, for 2 GHz MSS terminals employing TDMA the unwanted emission levels
will be related to the duration of the transmission time slot.<sup><a href="#N_26_">(26)</a></sup>
To provide protection to WAAS receivers, NTIA proposes that the unwanted
emissions of MSS terminals employing CDMA be averaged over a 20 msec time
interval. For 2 GHz MSS terminals employing TDMA the unwanted emissions
should be averaged over a time interval of duration that is equal in length
to the transmission time slot.</font>
<p><a NAME="VIII."></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">VIII. 2 GHz MSS
TERMINAL CARRIER-OFF EMISSION LIMITS MUST BE LESS THAN CARRIER-ON LIMITS.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Both ETSI and the ITU-R recognize that
MSS terminals operating in the 1990-2025 MHz band have two operational
states: carrier-on and carrier-off. In the carrier-on state, an MSS terminal
is transmitting a signal in a continuous or non-continuous mode. In the
carrier-off state, an MSS terminal is powered-on but not transmitting a
signal. The emission limits proposed by the Commission only apply to the
situation where an MSS terminal is in the carrier-on state. When an MSS
terminal is in the carrier-off (<i>e.g.</i>, stand-by) state, any emissions
should be held to levels that are lower than those for the carrier-on state.
While this is obvious, a provision still needs to be included in the service
rules, otherwise the probability of more than one MSS terminal being in
a position to cause interference to an aircraft in a final approach landing
becomes unacceptably large. Therefore, NTIA recommends that the carrier-off
limit be 10 dB lower that the carrier-on limit to account for a cumulative
power effect. The cumulative effect is attributed to the significant majority
of MSS terminals in the carrier-off state.</font>

NTIA believes that a user in need of emergency assistance should receive
help independent of which type of wireless device that person is using.
This should be independent of whether the network is terrestrially based

it is essential that the USCG know the location of individuals in distress
and be able to confirm the existence of a distress situation. In order
to do this, the USCG must be able to immediately determine ANI and Automatic

level of -163 dBW in the 100 MHz measurement bandwidth has been established
by ITU-R Recommendation SA.1029-1.<sup><a href="#N_50_">(50)</a></sup>
This interference level cannot be exceeded for more than 1 percent of the
sensor's measurement cells either by in-band or by out-of-band emissions.
Any MSS feeder downlinks operating in the 10.7-10.95 GHz band could potentially
cause interference to orbiting passive sensors of the EESS (passive) through
reflections off of the Earth's surface. Detailed study would be required
in order to determine what the permissible power levels and out-of-band
emission characteristics of any MSS feeder downlinks would have to be in
order to protect the passive sensors operations in the adjacent 10.6-10.7
GHz band.</font>

This band is adjacent to the 2025-2110 MHz band that is allocated to Government

earth stations. The band 2025-2110 MHz is extensively used by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NASA recommends that ITU-R Recommendations
could be used in the development of policies and rules for the implementation
of MSS at 2 GHz. NASA believes that if care is taken in the initial design
phases of MSS systems that mutually satisfactory, interference-free operations
of both services is feasible.<sup><a href="#N_52_">(52)</a></sup></font>

<p><a NAME="N_17_"></a>17.&nbsp; The proposed EIRP limits of -70 dBW/MHz
(wide band) and -80 dBW (narrow band) over the RNSS frequency band are
the limits that will protect the GNSS receivers under a specific scenario.
One of the most important elements of the scenario was the assumption that
there would be only one interfering MSS transmitter at any give time. As
a result of this assumption the entire GNSS interference budget was allocated
to this one MSS interference source. If multiple sources were considered
the allowable interference would be lower.
