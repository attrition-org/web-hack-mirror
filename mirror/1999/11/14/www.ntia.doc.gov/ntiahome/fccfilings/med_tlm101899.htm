<p>Ms. Magalie Roman Salas
<br>Secretary
<br>Federal Communications Commission
<br>445 12<sup>th</sup> Street, S.W.
<br>Washington, DC 20554
<p>RE: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Amendment of Parts 2 and 95 of the
Commission's Rules to Create a Wireless Medical Telemetry Service, ET Docket
99-255
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Dear Ms. Salas:
<p>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA),
in coordination with the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC),
has reviewed the comments in the above-referenced proceeding. NTIA offers
these reply comments.
<p>NTIA recognizes the importance of medical telemetry services and that
many Federal hospitals would use this technology to provide essential medical
services. NTIA, moreover, supports the Commission's identified frequency
band options for use by the medical telemetry service. NTIA notes that
the use of the three bands of Option 1, 608-614 MHz, 1395-1400 MHz, and
1429-1432 MHz, would provide increased spectrum flexibility over the two
bands of Option 2, 608-614 MHz and 1391-1400 MHz. We further support the
Commission's proposal to limit the field strength in the 608-614 MHz band
to 200 mV/m at a distance of 3 meters to protect radio astronomy operations.
<p>NTIA believes that the Commission should encourage the manufacturers
of medical telemetry equipment to develop systems where the operating frequency
bands can easily be changed among the selected bands. This would provide
the flexibility to satisfy the spectrum requirements should one or two
bands encounter sharing difficulties. Option 1 also provides some additional
protection from potential compatibility problems with Federal Government
high-powered radars operating in the 1215-1390 MHz band since the 1391-1400
MHz band of Option 2 is nearer the radar band. NTIA agrees with the proposal
by the American Hospital Association Task Force on Medical Telemetry (AHA
Task Force) to establish a frequency coordinator to coordinate the shared
use of the spectrum with remaining Government operations at protected sites
in the reallocated bands and between Federal and non-Federal hospitals.
NTIA believes a frequency coordinator would facilitate band sharing and
compatible operations.
<p>NTIA reallocated the 1390-1400 MHz and 1427-1432 MHz bands to the private
sector following the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. In the
Spectrum Reallocation Final Report, NTIA pointed out potential adjacent
band sharing problems, noting that "to achieve the goals set by Title VI
for development of new technologies, adoption of effective receiver standards,
either by regulatory or established by industry, is essential for bands
identified in the final plan that are adjacent to high-power Federal systems."<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup>
NTIA urges the adoption of effective receiver standards to preclude adjacent
band interference from high powered radars.
<p>Comments filed by both Orbital Communications Corporation (ORBCOMM)
and Final Analysis Communications Services, Inc. (Final Analysis) indicate
that the 1390-1393 MHz band is under consideration for the Earth-to-space
uplink feederlink earth stations, and the 1429-1432 MHz band is being considered
for the space-to-Earth downlink feederlink stations for non-voice-non-geostationary
(NVNG) mobile-satellite service (MSS). NTIA believes that NVNG MSS uplink
feederlinks and medical telemetry systems should be able to operate compatibly
with minimal operating restrictions. This is possible because there are
a limited number of gateway stations that could be sufficiently isolated
from hospitals to preclude interference. However, parties in this proceeding
express concern about this sharing.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup> No
technical parameters were provided in the comments showing how their conclusions
were reached, and if Option 2 is selected, we urge the Commission and the
concerned parties to consider the possibilities of sharing spectrum between
these two uses.
<p>Some parties also express concern about difficulties in sharing spectrum
between NVNG MSS downlink feederlinks and medical telemetry.<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup>
We think it should be possible, however, to share in the downlink direction,
as well, and if Option 1 is selected, we urge the Commission and the concerned
parties to consider the possibilities of sharing spectrum between these
two uses.
<p>Three other bands not included in the Commission's options were put
forward by the commenters, but have several problems. One of the bands
originally requested by the AHA Task Force, 1385-1390 MHz, has been "reclaimed
for use on a primary basis by the Department of Defense"as a result of
the recently enacted National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2000.<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup> Therefore, this band cannot be
considered for allocation for medical telemetry. The second band,1432-1435
MHz, was reallocated under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which requires
the Commission to assign licenses in the reallocated spectrum by competitive
bidding. The third band, 1427-1429 MHz, is adjacent to a radio astronomy
band below 1427 MHz and could be used if out-of-band emissions of the medical
telemetry devices do not interfere with the radio astronomy service.
<p>Thank you for your consideration of these views.
<p>Sincerely,
<br>&nbsp;
