<p><font face="Times New Roman">Re: 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review - Review
of Accounts Settlement in the Maritime Mobile and Maritime Mobile-Satellite
Radio Services and Withdrawal of the Commission as an Accounting Authority
in the Maritime Mobile and Maritime Mobile-Satellite Radio Services, IB
Docket No. 98-96.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Ms. Salas:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA) provides the following comments to the Further Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking (Further Notice) in the above referenced proceeding.
These comments have been coordinated with the Interdepartment Radio Advisory
Committee (IRAC), which includes the Coast Guard.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Further Notice, the Commission specifically
sought comments from NTIA and the Coast Guard on how to meet concerns of
U.S. Government agencies during the Commission's planned withdrawal as
an accounting authority for settling international accounts in the maritime
mobile and maritime mobile-satellite services. Additionally, the Commission
asked U.S. Government agencies to provide information regarding the costs
associated with decentralizing the settlement process for Government users
(<i>See</i> Further Notice at &sect; 36).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Many users of ship stations and INMARSAT
terminals do not understand the need for an accounting authority and the
associated procedures, and in many cases, they are not aware that they
have an accounting authority. The barring of services through nonpayment
of improperly routed, unpaid bills could adversely affect safety of life
at sea and disrupt Government operations.<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup>
We support, therefore, the Commission's proposals to contact current users
to advise them of the need to make arrangements with an accounting authority
for settling international accounts (<i>See</i> Further Notice at &sect;
35,36). We acknowledge that this may be especially difficult for HF and
VHF ship stations and therefore we encourage the Commission to work closely
with maritime trade associations and recreational organizations as they
have proposed. In addition, contacting Federal INMARSAT users may be difficult
because Federal agencies do not always commission INMARSAT terminals centrally
and there are no complete, centrally maintained Federal records. We believe
that the Commission must notify each INMARSAT user directly, using commissioning
information available from the Communications Satellite Corporation (Comsat).
The notification should explain the functioning of an accounting authority,
the impact on terminal operations resulting from failure to select an accounting
authority, the new accounting authority of last resort (if the Commission
nominates one), the users' rights and obligations, and the addresses of
all authorized accounting authorities. Similarly, the Commission should
require any new accounting authority of last resort to notify each affected
user of their assignment as accounting authority of last resort and of
the payment procedures.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">An accounting authority of last resort
is necessary to avoid the safety problems outlined above until all INMARSAT
users and VHF and HF ship stations make agreements with private accounting
authorities. We believe that the Commission should either remain as the
accounting authority of last resort or immediately designate a private
accounting authority of last resort. The selection of a private accounting
authority should be based upon the ability of the accounting authority
to handle the number of accounts involved and the costs to the user. The
organization selected as an accounting authority of last resort should
not charge more than the Commission currently charges its accounts until
users are notified and given a chance to select their own accounting authority
or accept the terms offered.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As we stated in our August 24, 1998 comments
on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding, most Federal agencies
will require at least three years from the time that the Commission renders
a decision in this proceeding to establish a contract with a private accounting
authority. This is true for a contract to make routine payments or to make
irregular payments for inadvertent or emergency use of a foreign shore
earth station. If the Commission were to implement the proposed change
immediately, some Federal agencies would be unable to establish an accounting
authority contract until 2003.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup> However,
if the Commission were to establish a contract itself with an accounting
authority to process accounts for the Commission as the accounting authority
of last resort, a transition period might not be necessary. The Commission
could transfer its work to the new accounting authority of last resort
at any time and phase out its contractual relationship with the new private
accounting authority of last resort as INMARSAT users and VHF and HF ship
stations reach agreement with their own accounting authorities.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commission must make changes in accounting
authority procedures carefully. Depending upon how this phase-out is handled,
this action could disrupt Government operations, increase costs, and adversely
affect the safety of life at sea. We urge the Commission to refrain from
taking action until it can be assured that disruption and safety problems
will not occur.</font>

<br><a NAME="N_1_"></a>1. <font face="Times New Roman">Persons who place
an INMARSAT call through a land earth station with which they have no contract
depend upon their accounting authority to send them the bill. If two unpaid
bills from land earth stations remain undelivered or unpaid, INMARSAT will
bar the user from routine and certain forms of emergency service with all
its land earth stations.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_2_"></a><font face="Times New Roman">2. A contract is required,
and some time is needed, even if no fee is charged for accounting authority
services.</font>
