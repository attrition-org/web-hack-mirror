<p>The Honorable William E. Kennard
<br>Chairman
<br>Federal Communications Commission
<br>445 12th Street, S.W.
<br>Washington, DC 20554
<p>Re: Revision of the Commission's Rules to Ensure Compatibility with
Enhanced 911 Emergency Calling Systems, CC Docket No. 94-102, RM-8143
<p>Dear Chairman Kennard:
<p>On behalf of the Administration, I am writing to commend the Commission
for its efforts with regard to implementation of Enhanced 911 (E911) calling
for commercial mobile wireless devices. At stake is the ability to improve
the safety of millions of Americans, potentially saving thousands of lives.
There were over 35 million wireless 911 and distress calls from mobile
phones last year, almost 100,000 calls each day.<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup>
Americans who use their wireless phones to place a 911 call should have
the benefits of E911 emergency calling in much the same way as people do
when they use their wireline phone, through automatic location identification
to public safety answer points. The Administration believes that the Commission
will best enable us to meet our public safety goals by establishing rules
that allow those directly responsible for carrying emergency information,
public safety agencies and carriers, to choose the appropriate method of
bringing E911 to the public.
<p>I write specifically to address the Commission's pending decision whether
to revise the "Phase II" standards for identifying the location of a caller
within a cell, in light of recent technological development of handset-based
technology.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup> The standards, as previously
adopted by the Commission, are scheduled to become effective on October
1, 2001.<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup>
<p>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
strongly urges the Commission hold to a strict timetable for implementation
of automatic location technology capability so that consumers receive the
benefits without delay. The Administration is concerned that a delay in
the development and availability of location technology would mean the
loss of many lives needlessly. Too many lives have already been lost because
rescuers could not pinpoint the location of a wireless 911 call.
<p>The need to move forward without delay, however, should not be equated
with limiting the technologies and approaches that could possibly bring
this technology to consumers. NTIA agrees with the Commission and many
commenters that the Commission's rules should not discourage innovation
in location technology.<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup> NTIA believes
that creating more options for carriers to meet the Commission's rules
for implementation of E911 will engender competition among the various
options and that this competitive environment will help to jump start and
then accelerate the implementation process.
<p>Currently, no single technology appears to be optimal for all situations.
The existing rule is directed at achieving a certain penetration rate in
a relatively short period of time. The network solution has the advantage
of reaching most subscribers immediately once the technology is in a given
network; there is no need for subscribers to acquire new phones. However,
in some areas served or proposed to be served by only one cell, such as
some rural areas, technology built into new handsets may reach consumers
sooner than network location technology that depends on a coverage by at
least two cells. In addition, handset technology may provide a greater
degree of accuracy in locating callers.
<p>In order to prevent delay in the implementation of this critical capability,
NTIA believes that the Commission should revise its requirements on service
providers to allow for implementation of E911 via network, handset, or
some combination of the two solutions. The Commission should, however,
work within its original implementation timetable for when consumers will
have the benefit of this capability.
<p>NTIA also hopes that timely resolution of several other important issues,
in particular cost recovery, that are proving to be obstacles to both Phase
I and Phase II, can speed implementation of E911.
<p>Thank you for your consideration of these views.
<p>Sincerely,
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Larry Irving
