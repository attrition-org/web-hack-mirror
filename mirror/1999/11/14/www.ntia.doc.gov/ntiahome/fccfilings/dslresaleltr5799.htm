<p>The Honorable William E. Kennard

<br>Washington, D.C. 20554
<p>Re: <b>Ex Parte</b> -- Deployment of Wireline Services Offering Advanced

<br><u>Telecommunications Capability, CC Docket No. 98-147</u>
<p>In the Commission's August 7, 1998 <u>Memorandum Opinion and Order</u>
in the above-captioned proceeding, the Commission tentatively concluded
that the digital subscriber line (DSL) services to be marketed by many
incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) are telecommunications services
provided to non-carrier customers.<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup> Consequently,
ILECs must make those services available to requesting carriers at discounted
rates, in accordance with section 251(c)(4) of the Communications Act.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup>
<p>A number of ILECs are now requesting that the Commission revisit its
tentative conclusion, at least with respect to DSL services marketed by
ILECs to Internet service providers (ISPs).<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup>
Some ILECs apparently plan to offer those services to ISPs at rates below
those charged to current residential and business customers. The size of
the discount generally will vary with the number of lines ordered and the
duration of the agreement.<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup> The ISPs will
then combine the DSL services with their Internet offerings and market
the bundled package to their own customers.
<p>ILECs assert that if the DSL services they sell to ISPs are subject
to the resale requirements of section 251(c)(4), ILECs would be compelled
to make those reduced rate services available to requesting carriers at
an additional discount. They contend that such an outcome would lessen
ILECs' incentives to offer cut-rate service to ISPs, thereby slowing the
deployment of DSL technology.<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup> Accordingly,
the companies urge the Commission to clarify that DSL services marketed
by ILECs to ISPs are not subject to the provisions of section 251(c)(4).
<p>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
believes that the Commission should grant the ILECs' request, subject to
the conditions described below. The plain language of section 251(c)(4)
obligates ILECs to make available to competing carriers only those "telecommunications
services" that ILECs provide "at retail to subscribers who are not telecommunications
carriers."<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup> The key word, in this instance,
is "retail." In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it must be assumed
that Congress meant for that word to have its ordinary and common meaning<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup>
-- the sale of goods or services to the ultimate consumer for its own use.<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup>
<p>Plainly, ISPs are not the ultimate consumers of the DSL services that
they acquire from ILECs. Rather, they resell those services to consumers
as part of a larger Internet service offering. Like the access services
that interexchange carriers purchase from ILECs, DSL services are "an input
component to the [ISPs] own retail services." As such, when provided to
ISPs, those offerings, like access, are "fundamentally non-retail services."<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></sup>
<p>The Telecommunications Resellers Association (TRA) asserts that the
sale of DSL to an ISP is a retail offering, "[j]ust as the sale of computer
chips to a manufacturer of computers is a retail transaction."<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></sup>
TRA provides no authority for the latter assertion, however. Furthermore,
there are fundamental differences in the dealings between a chip maker
and a computer company and the dealings between the chip manufacturer and
a classic retail customer -- the individual wishing to buy one or a few
semiconductors for his or her own use. The computer company typically acquires
its chips in substantially higher volumes, at significantly lower prices,
and through a different distribution system than the individual. Given
those dissimilarities, one cannot conclude that the both types of transactions
are "retail" in the common sense of that word.
<p>MCI WorldCom (MCI-W) contends that the ILECs' DSL services must be considered
retail in nature because many of the ILECs are currently providing such
services "to literally millions of new business and residential customers."<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a></sup>
It apparently believes that once a service is retailed to some customers,
the service must be considered a retail offering for all customers. While
not implausible, MCI-W's theory is difficult to square with section 252(d)(3),
which specifies the standard for establishing the discount for services
that must be made available for resale under section 251(c)(4). Section
252(d)(3) requires that the discount be based on the "retail rates charged"
for the service in question.<sup><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></sup> Read together,
section 251(c)(4) and 252(d)(3) strongly suggest that an ILEC has no resale
obligation with respect to services provided on a non-retail basis -- even
if those same services are also sold at retail -- because there would be
no retail rate on which to base a discount.
<p>Consequently, the Commission should clarify that DSL services marketed
by ILECs to ISPs are not "retail" offerings subject to the requirements
of section 251(c)(4). On the other hand, they are assuredly "telecommunications
services."<sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)</a></sup> As a result, ILECs must
comply with their basic common carrier obligations: to provide such DSL
services upon reasonable request; on just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory
terms; and in accordance with all applicable tariffing requirements.<sup><a href="#N_14_">(14)</a></sup>
Thus, the same DSL rates must be available to all ISPs with similar levels
of demand and lengths of contract.<sup><a href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup>
Indeed, NTIA sees no reason why the rates that ILECs offer to ISPs should
not be available to other potential buyers, including competing local exchange
carriers (CLECs).
<p>Further, when an ILEC chooses to market DSL services to residential
and business customers, NTIA agrees with the Commission that those offerings
are telecommunications services provided at retail to non-carrier customers
and, thus, subject to section 251(c)(4).<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup>
Accordingly, ILECs would have to make those services available to competing
carriers at discounted rates. Under section 252(d)(3) of the Communications
Act, in the event that the affected parties cannot agree on a discount,
the relevant State regulatory commission must determine a discount based
upon the costs that will be avoided by the ILEC as a result of the resale
arrangement.<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup> To guide State commission
deliberations in such cases, NTIA recommends that the Commission amend
its rules for implementing section 252(d)(3) to create a presumption that
the appropriate DSL discount for any particular CLEC should be no less
than the reduction from the prevailing retail rate that the ILEC makes
available to ISPs.<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup> For example, if
an ILEC gives a 30 percent discount from the applicable retail price to
an ISP requesting 1,000 DSL lines on a 12-month contract, the same discount,
at a minimum should be available under section 252(d)(3) to a CLEC with
comparable demand for a similar length of time.<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup>
<p>Thank you for your consideration of these views.
<p>Sincerely,
<br>&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="N_11_"></a>11. Letter from Richard Whitt, MCI WorldCom, Inc.,
to FCC Secretary Magalie Salas, CC Docket No. 98-147, at 4 (Apr. 1, 1999).
MCI-W asks why the ILECs "could not simply propose and adopt a non-discriminatory
volume discount structure as a way to provide certain entities with more
significant discounts; this way all users and carriers could benefit from
discounts, based on the traffic they generate." <u>Id</u>. It neglects
to mention that if DSL services are declared to be retail offerings in
all circumstances, as MCI-W demands, competing carriers would be entitled
to the relevant volume discount plus an additional deduction from that
"retail" rate pursuant to section 251(c)(4).
<p>The company also notes that, for ISPs, DSL services are an alternative
to the business lines they have used "to provide their customers with dial-up
Internet access." <u>Id</u> at 4 n.14. Because those business lines are
clearly retail services, MCI-W says, the DSL services that replace them
must be as well. That is akin to a claim that because a screwdriver can
do a hammer's job in some instances, it must be classified as the same
sort of tool.
<p><a NAME="N_12_"></a>12. 47 U.S.C. &sect; 252(d)(3) (Supp. II 1996).
<p><a NAME="N_13_"></a>13. <u>See</u> <u>Order and Notice</u>, 13 FCC Rcd
at 24029-24030, &para;&para; 35-36.
<p><a NAME="N_14_"></a>14. Among other things, LECs must show that the
DSL rates that they charge to their ISP customers, including any volume
and term discounts, cover all relevant costs of providing service, including
a reasonable share of the costs of the underlying subscriber loop.
<p><a NAME="N_15_"></a>15. In order to qualify for any available volume
discount, an ISP should be able to aggregate its demand within the entire
area served by the selling ILEC.
<p><a NAME="N_16_"></a>16. <u>See</u> <u>Order and Notice</u>, 13 FCC Rcd
at 24040, &para;&para; 60-61; Letter from Larry Irving, NTIA, to FCC Chairman
William Kennard, CC Docket No. 98-147, at 2 (Jan. 11, 1999).
<p><a NAME="N_17_"></a>17. 47 U.S.C. &sect; 252(d)(3) (Supp. II 1996).
<p><a NAME="N_18_"></a>18. The Supreme Court's ruling in <u>AT&amp;T v.
Iowa Util. Bd.</u>, 119 S.Ct. 721 (1999), affirmed the Commission's authority
to adopt pricing rules governing ILECs' provision of interconnection, unbundled
network elements, and resale pursuant to 251(c). <u>See</u> <u>id</u>.
at 729-733. Although such a rule might produce discounts for DSL services
different from those applicable to other resale services, the Commission
has already concluded that, because avoided costs may vary from service
to service, discounts need not be uniform across all services. <u>See</u>
<u>Local Competition Order</u>, <u>supra</u>, 11 FCC Rcd at 15957-15958,
&para; 916.
<p><a NAME="N_19_"></a>19. A CLEC would, of course, have an opportunity
under section 252 to obtain an even larger discount than the one made available
by an ILEC to an ISP (or any other customer) if the CLEC could demonstrate
that the ILEC would avoid more costs by wholesaling DSL service to the
CLEC, rather than to that other customer.
