<p><a NAME="EXECUTIVE"></a><u>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</u></center>

<p>The market-opening provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996
(1996 Act) are stimulating the growth of local exchange competition. More
than 140 companies are now providing local service in the 100 largest urban
markets, as well as many smaller areas. Competitive local exchange carriers
(CLECs) have attracted more than $30 billion in capital and currently serve
between 2 and 3 percent of all local access lines. Although competitors
provide service predominantly via facilities acquired from incumbent local
exchange carriers (ILECs), CLECs are also aggressively deploying their
own switching and transmission equipment. One investment firm has identified
the reasons for this proliferation of competition -- "the combination of
access to low cost capital coupled with a clear regulatory and public policy
initiative toward opening up local markets." The fundamental question at
issue in this proceeding is whether the Commission should alter the course
it set in 1996 and change substantially the ILECs' unbundling obligations
under section 251(c)(3) of the Communications Act. NTIA believes that it
should not.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The Administration has consistently favored competition as the most
effective mechanism for promoting investment in our nation's information
infrastructure. Competition will also benefit consumers by reducing prices,
increasing the range of available services, and speeding deployment of
advanced telecom networks and services. We see these forces at work today
in communities throughout the country.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The 1996 Act reflects that same procompetitive philosophy. Of particular
relevance for this proceeding, the Act seeks to foster local exchange competition
by creating entry opportunities for new service providers. It does so by,
among other things, imposing extensive unbundling obligations on ILECs.
For the most part, the unbundling rules adopted by the Commission in its
August 1996 <i>Local Competition Order</i> properly implement the framework
that Congress established and further the Act's procompetitive ends. Although
the Supreme Court's decision in <i>AT&amp;T v. Iowa Utilities Board</i>
mandates changes in those rules, NTIA does not believe it requires a fundamental
change in the course that the Commission has already charted.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>NTIA therefore recommends that the Commission reinstate in most respects
its 1996 unbundling regime. Specifically, the Commission should reaffirm
its list of seven network elements that ILECs must provide to competitors,
upon request, on a nationwide basis: (1) local loops; (2) network interface
devices; (3) local switching; (4) interoffice transmission facilities;
(5) signalling networks and call-related databases; (6) operations support
systems; and (7) operator services and directory services. The text and
legislative history of the 1996 Act indicate that Congress concluded that
ILEC provisioning of those elements was necessary, at a minimum, to open
up the ILECs' local exchange networks to competitive entry. NTIA also supports
the Commission's tentative decision to continue allowing State commissions
to require ILECs to furnish other network elements to competitors on an
unbundled basis if the State commissions conclude that such requirements
would be consistent with the provisions of the 1996 Act, as construed by
the Commission in this proceeding.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Although the 1996 Act imposes extensive unbundling obligations on ILECs,
NTIA nevertheless agrees that those requirements must be limited in scope
and in duration. Such limits will not substantially reduce entry opportunities
for new providers and should increase the likelihood of facilities-based
competition, which in the long run will provide consumer benefits, increase
firms' incentives to innovate, and create opportunities for deregulation.
Thus, we favor a construction of the "necessary" and "impair" standards
in section 251(d)(2) that would not entitle a competitor to obtain from
an ILEC any network element merely on a showing that the element would
be useful to the competitor in providing service. Instead, the competitor
would have to show, or the relevant government agency would have to conclude,
that a failure to obtain the requested element would appreciably and adversely
affect the competitor's ability to offer service, taking into account the
element's availability elsewhere in the market. Under this standard, the
Commission could reasonably determine, for example, that ILECs need not
provide access to readily available digital subscriber line access multiplexers
(DSLAMs) on an unbundled basis if competitors have reasonable and timely
access to ILEC subscriber loops and collocation space.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Finally, NTIA concludes that in market areas and market segments where
the growth of competition has rendered enforcement of unbundling requirements
unnecessary and, potentially, counterproductive, the Commission has the
authority to forbear from applying the Act's unbundling provisions. We
suggest that, in the first instance, the Commission exercise that forbearance
authority by continuing the ILECs' unbundling obligations, but affording
ILECs greater flexibility in pricing particular UNEs in markets where competitive
alternatives are readily available. NTIA recommends that the Commission
specify standards to be used in determining whether forbearance would be
appropriate in particular instances and discusses several factors that
could be considered.

<p><i>EX PARTE</i> COMMENTS OF THE
<br><u>NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION</u></center>

<p>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA),
an Executive Branch agency within the Department of Commerce, is the President's
principal advisor on domestic and international telecommunications and
information policy. NTIA respectfully comments on the Commission's Second
Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (<i>Notice</i>) in the above-captioned
proceeding.<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup>
<p><a NAME="I."></a>I. <u>INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF POSITION</u>
<p>In February 1996, Congress enacted and the President signed into law
landmark telecommunications reform legislation.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup>
The fundamental objective of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is "to
accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced telecommunications
and information technologies and services to all Americans by opening all
telecommunications markets to competition."<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup>
Although Congress expressed its market-opening aims in general terms, it
recognized that "[c]entral to opening up telecommunications to competition"
was the establishment and expansion of competition in one particular area
-- the local exchange markets controlled by incumbent local exchange carriers
(ILECs).<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup> Accordingly, while Congress
imposed general duties and obligations for all telecommunications carriers,
it subjected ILECs, and only ILECs, to additional and extensive interconnection,
unbundling, and resale requirements.<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup>
<p>In August 1996, the Commission promulgated regulations implementing
those portions of the 1996 Act designed to foster local exchange competition
-- including sections 251 and 252.<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup> Of
particular relevance here, the Commission adopted a core set of national
standards and procedures to promote consistent action by the private parties
and State agencies charged with converting the Act's requirements into
particular agreements between ILECs and CLECs.<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup>
In so doing, the Commission generally construed the ILECs' interconnection,
unbundling, and resale obligations under section 251(c) broadly -- <i>i.e.</i>,
to give competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) more access to the
ILECs' local networks, rather than less -- consistent with its understanding
of the pro-competitive objectives of the 1996 Act.
<p>Last January, the Supreme Court rejected most of the challenges to the
Commission's regulations.<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup> Most importantly,
the Court concluded that the Commission had broad authority to issue national
regulations implementing sections 251 and 252 of the 1996 Act.<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></sup>
At the same time, however, the Court overturned section 51.319 of the Commission's
rules (Rule 319),<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></sup> which specifies the
network elements that ILECs must make available on an unbundled basis to
CLECs pursuant to section 251(c)(3) of the Act.<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a></sup>
The Court determined that the Commission's selection of the unbundled network
elements (UNEs) enumerated in Rule 319 rested on an unreasonable construction
of the "necessary" and "impair" standards set out in section 251(d)(2)
of the Act.<sup><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></sup> Specifically, the Court
held that, in applying those standards, the Commission erred (1) by not
considering the "availability of elements outside the [ILEC's] network"
and (2) by assuming "that <i>any</i> increase in cost (or decrease in quality)
imposed by [an ILEC's] denial of a particular network element . . . causes
the failure to provide that element to 'impair' the [CLEC's] ability to
furnish its desired services." <sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)</a></sup> The
Court therefore remanded the unbundling issue to the Commission for further
proceedings consistent with the Court's opinion.
<p>ILECs take the minor cracks in the Commission's unbundling regime opened
by the Court's opinion as an opportunity to raze the building.<sup><a href="#N_14_">(14)</a></sup>
They insist that the Commission must construe the open-ended unbundling
language of the Act in accordance with their own notions of antitrust law
and principles of economic efficiency.<sup><a href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup>
The virtue of that approach for the ILECs is that, if their particular
version of antitrust and efficiency were adopted, it would dramatically
reduce their unbundling obligations under the 1996 Act and, not incidentally,
perpetuate their dominant positions in local exchange markets.
<p>The Commission's task in the present rulemaking, however, is to fashion
an unbundling regime that incorporates the Court's limited holdings but,
more importantly, effectuates the framework that Congress established and
furthers the fundamental objective of the 1996 Act -- to foster competition
in all telecommunications markets by creating entry opportunities for new
service providers.<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup> NTIA believes, moreover,
that it is important for the Commission's unbundling rules to promote efficient
facilities-based competition. To be sure, the 1996 Act affords competitors
three distinct entry options -- construction of their own facilities, resale
of ILEC services, and purchase of ILEC UNEs -- and does not express a preference
for a particular mode of entry.<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup> Facilities-based
entry, however, produces benefits that the other two entry strategies do
not or produce only to a lesser degree. As the Commission has pointed out,
construction of new local exchange networks "will not only lead to innovation
by the new competitors, but should also spur [ILECs] to upgrade their systems
and offer a broader array of desired service options to meet consumers'
demands."<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup>
<p>Furthermore, although entry via UNEs or resale can increase local competition,
both paths require substantial regulatory oversight to ensure that the
rates ILECs charge for such arrangements are reasonable.<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup>
"Pure" facilities-based entry also increases competition, but does not
entail the same government scrutiny of the ILECs' practices, because the
new entrant is less dependent on ILEC facilities and services. Furthermore,
substantial facilities-based competition can exert a disciplining effect
on ILEC rates for resale and UNEs that could reduce, over time, the need
for regulators to monitor ILEC rates for the latter offerings. In this
way, unbundling rules that foster <i>efficient</i> facilities-based local
entry (<i>i.e.</i>, entry based on an accurate assessment of the relative
costs of different entry strategies) would serve the proconsumer, procompetitive,
and deregulatory objectives of the 1996 Act.
<p>NTIA believes that the Commission can adhere to the Supreme Court's
mandate, faithfully implement the unbundling framework that Congress created,
and encourage efficient facilities-based entry without making substantial
changes to its existing unbundling rules. Accordingly, NTIA respectfully
recommends the following actions:
<p>1. <u>Scope of the ILEC's Unbundling Obligations</u>
<p>• The Commission should hold that the "necessary" criterion in section
251(d)(2) applies only to "proprietary" network elements, and that the
"impair" standards applies to both proprietary and "nonproprietary" elements.
<p>• The Commission should consider a proprietary element to be "necessary"
if that element (and the capabilities it provides) is a prerequisite to
the provision of a telecommunications service. In other words, is the desired
service possible without the capabilities and functionalities that the
requested element affords?
<p>• To ensure that unbundling requirements do not unduly reduce an ILEC's
incentives to innovate, a CLEC's inability to obtain a proprietary network
element from an ILEC should be deemed to "impair" that CLEC if the carrier's
self-provisioning of that element, or its securement from another source,
imposes a "significant" penalty on the CLEC in terms of cost, service quality,
time to market, etc. With respect to nonproprietary elements, on the other
hand, an impairment should exist if the requesting CLEC suffers a nontrivial
increase in cost or delay in providing service as a result of its inability
to secure a desired UNE from the ILEC.
<p>• The Commission should apply the statutory standards and specify a
list of UNEs, to be applicable uniformly throughout the country.<sup><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup>
NTIA believes that a reasonable set of national UNEs should include, at
a minimum, the seven elements set forth in Rule 319: (1) local loops; (2)
network interface devices; (3) local switching; (4) interoffice transmission
facilities; (5) signalling networks and call-related databases; (6) operations
support systems; and (7) operator services and directory services.
<p>• The Commission should allow State commissions to require that ILECs
make available UNEs not specified in the Federal list if CLECs requesting
those UNEs can demonstrate that their provision satisfies the relevant
statutory standards.
<p>• If, however, (1) an ILEC agrees to provide a requested UNE, or (2)
a State commission orders an ILEC to provide a particular UNE, the Commission
should create a rebuttable presumption that ILECs in any other part of
the country must provide that same UNE to requesting carriers. The burden
would then be on the ILEC to show that provision of that UNE to a requesting
CLEC would be inconsistent with the terms of the Act and the Commission's
implementing regulations.
<p>2. <u>Relaxation of Unbundling Obligations</u>: Although Congress imposed
broad-ranging unbundling obligations on ILECs, it did not require that
those requirements be perpetual or immutable. As those obligations (and
the other market-opening provisions of the 1996 Act) succeed in stimulating
more and more competition, the point may come when the costs of those requirements
outweigh the incremental benefits. The Commission may not, however, "sunset"
the provisions of section 251 upon the mere passage of time because it
lacks the authority to do so. It may, on the other hand, forbear from applying
them in accordance with the provisions of section 10 of the 1996 Act.<sup><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></sup>
As discussed below, NTIA recommends that, in the first instance, the Commission
consider relaxing the unbundling requirements not by eliminating the obligation
to furnish particular UNEs whose provision would otherwise satisfy the
statutory requirements, but by giving ILECs greater flexibility in pricing
those UNEs. We also describe below some of the factors that the Commission
should address in deciding whether forbearance would be appropriate in
particular instances.
<p>The market-opening provisions of the 1996 Act are stimulating the growth
of local exchange competition. More than 140 companies are now providing
local service in the 100 largest urban markets, as well as many smaller
areas.<sup><a href="#N_22_">(22)</a></sup> CLECs have attracted more than
$30 billion in capital and currently serve between 2 and 3 percent of all
local access lines.<sup><a href="#N_23_">(23)</a></sup> Although competitors
provide service predominantly via facilities acquired from the ILECs, CLECs
are also aggressively deploying their own switching and transmission equipment.<sup><a href="#N_24_">(24)</a></sup>
ILECs and CLECs have widely divergent views as to effects of these developments
on the market dominance historically enjoyed by the ILECs. That debate,
however, is of less import to the present proceeding than are the reasons
for the progress made to date -- "the combination of access to low cost
capital coupled with a clear regulatory and public policy initiative toward
opening up local markets."<sup><a href="#N_25_">(25)</a></sup> The fundamental
question at issue here is whether the Commission should alter the course
established in 1996 and change substantially the ILECs' unbundling obligations
under section 251(c)(3). NTIA believes that it should not. Such changes
are not required by the Supreme Court's decision and would not further
the goals and objectives of the 1996 Act.
<p><a NAME="II"></a>II. IN ENACTING SECTION 251(C)(3), CONGRESS INTENDED
TO GIVE
<br><u>CLECS BROAD ACCESS TO UNBUNDLED NETWORK ELEMENTS.</u>
<p>The Commission's task in this proceeding is to revise its rules implementing
the unbundling provisions of the 1996 Act, taking into account the Supreme
Court's limited comments as to the meaning of those provisions. To do so,
the Commission must not only hew to the Court's holding but also gain a
clear understanding of the unbundling rights and responsibilities that
Congress meant to create when it enacted sections 251(c)(3) and (d)(2).<sup><a href="#N_26_">(26)</a></sup>
<p>One important question is the possible relationship between the statutory
unbundling requirements and the so-called "essential facilities" doctrine.
Although the Court specifically declined to decide whether section 251(d)(2)
codifies "something akin" to that antitrust concept,<sup><a href="#N_27_">(27)</a></sup>
Justice Breyer, concurring in the Court's judgment, opined that the statute
"does impose related limits upon the FCC's power to compel unbundling."<sup><a href="#N_28_">(28)</a></sup>
The Commission has therefore solicited comment "on the significance of
the essential facilities standard under section 251(d)(2)."<sup><a href="#N_29_">(29)</a></sup>
<p>NTIA submits that, if anything is clear from the text of the Act's unbundling
requirements, it is that they do not codify the essential facilities doctrine.<sup><a href="#N_30_">(30)</a></sup>
The language of the statute makes no mention of it and congressional reports
and debates concerning the bills that became the 1996 Act are devoid of
any reference to it. More importantly, the requirements for making an essential
facilities case differ in material respects from the unbundling standards
set forth in section 251(c)(3) and (d)(2) of the 1996 Act.
<p>The "essential facilities" doctrine holds that "a firm which controls
a facility essential to its competitors may be guilty of monopolization
[under section 2 of the Sherman Act] if it refuses to allow them access
to the facility.<sup><a href="#N_31_">(31)</a></sup> To invoke the doctrine,
four elements must be proven:
<blockquote>(1) control by the monopolist of the essential facility; (2)
the inability of the competitor seeking access to practically or reasonably
duplicate the facility; (3) the denial of the facility to the competitor;
and (4) the feasibility of the competitor to provide the facility.<sup><a href="#N_32_">(32)</a></sup></blockquote>

<p><br>Courts have occasionally ruled that a facility will be deemed essential
"only if control of the facility carries with it the power to <i>eliminate</i>
competition in the downstream market."<sup><a href="#N_33_">(33)</a></sup>
Most courts have held that, at a minimum, a plaintiff must show that the
defendant's refusal to grant access to its facility has inflicted a "severe
handicap on potential market entrants."<sup><a href="#N_34_">(34)</a></sup>
Furthermore, that refusal must be unreasonable, with reasonableness being
determined from the perspective of the defendant monopolist.<sup><a href="#N_35_">(35)</a></sup>
Finally, the case law indicates that denial of access to an essential facility
may not be actionable if the monopolist has legitimate business reasons
for its actions.<sup><a href="#N_36_">(36)</a></sup>
<p>The 1996 Act plainly imposes on ILECs a broader duty to deal with CLECs
than does the essential facilities doctrine. Even adopting the construction
of section 251(d)(2) that is most favorable to the ILECs -- <i>i.e.</i>,
that the "impairment" standard applies to all CLEC requests for UNEs --
the common definition of "impair" does not even approximate the "severe
handicap" that a CLEC must suffer in order to make an essential facilities
claim.<sup><a href="#N_37_">(37)</a></sup> Further, the prices for UNEs
must accord with a cost standard established by Congress, further defined
by the Commission, and applied by State commissions.<sup><a href="#N_38_">(38)</a></sup>
And, if application of section 251(d)(2) confirms that a CLEC is entitled
to a particular UNE, the statute gives the ILEC only one excuse for not
furnishing it -- <i>i.e.</i>, only if provision of that UNE at the point
requested by the CLEC is not technically feasible.<sup><a href="#N_39_">(39)</a></sup>
<p>Section 251 gives CLECs broader access to ILEC networks than would be
available under an essential facilities analysis because that section was
intended to serve a much broader purpose. The central purpose of the antitrust
doctrine is to prevent the expansion of monopoly power from one market
to another.<sup><a href="#N_40_">(40)</a></sup> As AT&amp;T points out,
if the underlying monopoly was lawfully obtained, the antitrust laws generally
will not disturb it, but will only seek to prevent its misuse.<sup><a href="#N_41_">(41)</a></sup>
Section 251, on the other hand, is designed to strike at the heart of the
monopoly itself. Congress was faced with a government-sanctioned local
exchange monopoly and determined that that monopoly must be opened to competition.<sup><a href="#N_42_">(42)</a></sup>
Because Congress sought to
<i>eliminate</i> the monopoly, rather than simply
to prevent its expansion, the tools that it employed were necessarily more
extensive than would be appropriate for a court to use in remedying a violation
of the essential facilities doctrine.
<p>Indeed, to the extent that Congress considered the essential facilities
doctrine at all, it concluded that (1) the ILECs' networks <i>are</i> essential
facilities and (2) that alternative providers must have broad access to
those facilities if there was to be local competition:
<blockquote>In the overwhelming majority of markets today, because of their
government-sanctioned-monopoly status, [ILECs] maintain bottleneck control
over the essential facilities needed for the provision of local telephone
service. The bottleneck consists of the elements needed to originate or
terminate a telephone call -- the equipment with capabilities of routing
and signalling calls, network capacity and network standards. The inability
of other service providers to gain access to the [ILECs'] equipment inhibits
competition that could otherwise develop in the local exchange market.<sup><a href="#N_43_">(43)</a></sup></blockquote>
There is no indication, moreover, that Congress meant for network elements
to be unbundled only when such unbundling comports with an ILEC's view
of economic reasonableness.<sup><a href="#N_44_">(44)</a></sup> The Senate
expected that questions about the reasonableness of a competitor's unbundling
request would be resolved not during the Commission's specification of
the ILECs' unbundling requirements under section 251(d)(2), but during
the interconnection negotiations between ILECs and competitors.<sup><a href="#N_45_">(45)</a></sup>
The House of Representatives was even more explicit on this point:
<p>[ILECs] have the duty to offer unbundled services, elements, features,
functions, and capabilities whenever technically feasible. During the Committee's
consideration of the bill, the Committee deleted a requirement that unbundling
be done on an "economically reasonable" basis out of concern that this
requirement could result in certain unbundled services, elements, features,
functions, and capabilities not being made available. The Committee clarified,
however, . . . that the beneficiary of unbundling must pay its cost.<sup><a href="#N_46_">(46)</a></sup>
<p>Congress was aware that the section 251(c) unbundling, interconnection,
and resale requirements would exact substantial costs and burdens on the
carriers subject to them.<sup><a href="#N_47_">(47)</a></sup> It nevertheless
decided that, on balance, the competitive benefits that such obligations
might produce were worth the costs that they would entail. To be sure,
Congress did conclude that, in some circumstances, the costs could outweigh
the benefits. Again, however, its chosen response was not to weaken the
requirements themselves, but (1) to limit the range of carriers subject
to them<sup><a href="#N_48_">(48)</a></sup> and (2) to require that competitors
pay the costs of the elements they request.
<p><a NAME="III."></a>III. SECTION 251(D)(2) DOES NOT REDUCE SUBSTANTIALLY
THE
<br><u>UNBUNDLING REQUIREMENTS MANDATED BY SECTION 251(C)(3).</u>
<p>The legislative history of the 1996 Act confirms that, in enacting section
251(c)(3), Congress intended to confer substantial unbundling rights upon
CLECs. That conclusion is supported by the statutory text, which imposes
only four limits on a CLEC's demand for parts of an ILEC's network:
<blockquote>(1) The CLEC must request a "network element";
<p>(2) The element must be used to provide a "telecommunications service";
<p>(3) Unbundling may only occur at a technically feasible point; and
<p>(4) The CLEC must pay a reasonable price for the requested element,
as determined in accordance with section 252.<sup><a href="#N_49_">(49)</a></sup></blockquote>
The Supreme Court held, however, that the "necessary" and "impair" language
of section 251(d)(2) fixes an additional limitation on the availability
of UNEs. It instructed the Commission, on remand, to give some substance
to those limiting standards, "taking into account the objectives of the
Act."<sup><a href="#N_50_">(50)</a></sup>
<p>A. <u>Applicability of Section 251(d)(2)</u>
<p>Section 251(d)(2) specifies that:
<blockquote>In determining what network elements should be made available
for purposes of subsection [251](c)(3), the Commission shall consider,
at a minimum, whether --
<br>(A) access to such network elements as are proprietary in nature is
necessary; and
<p>(B) the failure to provide access to such network elements would impair
the ability of the telecommunications carrier seeking access to provide
the services that it seeks to offer.<sup><a href="#N_51_">(51)</a></sup></blockquote>
NTIA agrees with Sprint that one reasonable construction of the statutory
language is that the "necessary" and "impair" standards were meant to apply
only to proprietary network elements.<sup><a href="#N_52_">(52)</a></sup>
We nonetheless recognize that the Commission adopted (and the reviewing
courts implicitly accepted) a different construction of the statute in
the <i>Local Competition Report</i>, and that there are legitimate reasons
why the Commission would be reluctant to reject that construction now.
<p>NTIA submit, however, that there is only one other reasonable construction
of section 251(d)(2). Plainly, the "necessary" standard applies only to
proprietary elements. The "impair" criterion, on the other hand, would
seem to apply to both proprietary and nonproprietary elements. The phrase
"such network elements" in section 251(d)(2)(B) has only two possible antecedents
-- "such network elements as are proprietary" in section 251(d)(2)(A) or
"what network elements should be made available" in the first sentence
of section 251(d)(2). If the former phrase is the intended antecedent,
then the necessary and impair criteria limit access only to proprietary
elements. If the latter antecedent governs, the "impair" standard must
apply to all network elements eligible for unbundling under the general
requirements of section 251(c)(3). That universe of "all possible UNEs"
must necessarily include the subsets of proprietary and nonproprietary
UNEs.
<p>B. The Supreme Court's Decision Does Not Limit Significantly the
<br><u>Commission's Discretion in Construing the "Necessary" and "Impair"
Tests.</u>
<p>Regardless of how the Commission resolves the question of the applicability
of the "necessary" and "impair" standards, it must comply with the Supreme
Court's charge to "giv[e] some substance" to those requirements. Although
the Court did not give the Commission much guidance as to the proper construction
of "necessary" and "impair," the language it used and the examples it chose
to illustrate its criticisms of the Commission's decision on this issue
confirm that complying with the Court's mandate does not require a dramatic
change in the Commission's reading of the statutory standards.
<p>The majority cited only two specific faults with the Commission's implementation
of section 251(d)(2). First, the Commission applied the necessary and impair
standards without considering the availability of network elements from
non-ILEC sources.<sup><a href="#N_53_">(53)</a></sup> The Court did not,
however, make "availability from non-ILEC sources" a separate element in
the section 251(d)(2) analysis. It merely held that the Commission, in
conducting the necessary and impair inquiry, may not "disregard[] entirely
the availability of elements outside the [ILEC's] network."<sup><a href="#N_54_">(54)</a></sup>
The Court's ruling does not mean that an ILEC is absolved of its obligation
to unbundle a network element simply because that element is available
somewhere else. The Commission must still consider whether, for example,
a CLEC's ability to offer service would be impaired if it must secure a
desired UNE from an alternative source, rather than from the ILEC.
<p>Second, the Court rejected "the Commission's assumption that <i>any</i>
increase in cost (or decrease in quality) imposed by a denial of a network
element" constitutes an impairment.<sup><a href="#N_55_">(55)</a></sup>
The Court's holding in no way suggests that a "substantial" cost penalty
is required.<sup><a href="#N_56_">(56)</a></sup> That conclusion follows
from the numerical example that the Court used to make its point: "An entrant
whose anticipated annual profits from the proposed service are reduced
from 100% of investment to 99% of investment has perhaps been 'impaired'
in its ability to amass earnings, but has not <i>ipso facto</i> been 'impaired
. . . in its ability to provide the services it seeks to offer.'"<sup><a href="#N_57_">(57)</a></sup>
The Court's selection of the smallest possible integer (<i>i.e.</i>, 1)
out of 100 possibilities<sup><a href="#N_58_">(58)</a></sup> to represent
an "non-impairing" percentage profit loss begs for the inference that an
"impairing" reduction would be much closer to one percent than to 100 percent.
<p>As the Court recognized, moreover, even the smallest increase in costs
or reduction in quality may impair a firm's viability in a highly competitive
market in which all firms are providing service at marginal cost.<sup><a href="#N_59_">(59)</a></sup>
Although the local exchange market is not an example of perfect competition
at work, for a new entrant it is also not the Court's posited Shangri-La
where anticipated profits approach 100 percent of investment. As AT&amp;T
points out, a CLEC trying to gain a foothold in the local exchange faces
substantial cost disadvantages that will deny it the hope of "handsome"
profits, let alone "handsomer" ones.<sup><a href="#N_60_">(60)</a></sup>
The pressures on CLECs to price at the margin will likely increase over
time as new entry occurs and the ILECs respond to that entry. Thus, while
the local exchange is not an "ideal world" where any cost differential
can be devastating, for newcomer CLECs it is a place where even small disparities
in cost, quality, or time to market can "impair" their ability to compete.
<p>In short, the Court's ruling does not significantly limit the Commission's
discretion in implementing section 251(d)(2). Carefully read, the controlling
opinion reveals that the Court had no fundamental objections to the Commission's
interpretation of section 251(d)(2). In the Court's eye, the Commission
erred not by trivializing a stringent standard, but by effectively nullifying
a relatively lenient one.<sup><a href="#N_61_">(61)</a></sup>
<p>C. <u>"Necessary" and "Impair"</u>
<p>In the absence of any statutory definition of the operative words in
section 251(d)(2), the Commission should give them their ordinary and common
meaning.<sup><a href="#N_62_">(62)</a></sup> It should also seek so far
as possible to construe those terms in a way that advances the procompetitive
goals of the 1996 Act, including the promotion of efficient facilities-based
competition.<sup><a href="#N_63_">(63)</a></sup> The Commission must also
accommodate the fact that the necessary and impair criteria apply to proprietary
elements.<sup><a href="#N_64_">(64)</a></sup> It should not therefore conflate
the two standards by importing notions of "impairment" into the definition
of "necessary."<sup><a href="#N_65_">(65)</a></sup> That would, in effect,
render the impairment standard superfluous.<sup><a href="#N_66_">(66)</a></sup>
<p>NTIA believes that the Commission can preserve the distinction between
the two words, by bearing in mind the different purpose that each was intended
to serve. "Necessary" pertains to the relationship between the element
requested (and its associated "features, functionalities, and capabilities")
and a service that the CLEC seeks to offer. Recall that section 251(c)(3)
permits a CLEC to request UNEs "for the provision of a telecommunications
service."<sup><a href="#N_67_">(67)</a></sup> Thus, the general language
seems to require unbundling whenever there is <i>any</i> plausible connection
between UNE and service. In mandating that proprietary elements be "necessary,"
Congress plainly meant to require a closer nexus between a requested UNE
and the proposed service, doubtless to ensure that the unbundling regime
did not unduly restrict ILECs' incentives to innovate.<sup><a href="#N_68_">(68)</a></sup>
<p>The impairment standard, on the other hand, seems designed to address
the economic and competitive effects for a CLEC if it must acquire a particular
UNE, or a substitute for it, from a non-LEC (or if the CLEC may only secure
a substitute UNE from the ILEC). The impair standard applies to proprietary
elements because although Congress did not wish to give CLECs relatively
unfettered access to such elements, it recognized that CLECs may need access
to proprietary UNEs in some circumstances if competition were to develop.<sup><a href="#N_69_">(69)</a></sup>
Indeed, if CLECs can obtain proprietary elements only when strictly necessary,
ILECs might attempt to create such elements in order to limit their unbundling
obligations.<sup><a href="#N_70_">(70)</a></sup> For all of these reasons,
NTIA believes that the relationship between the necessary and impair standards
described above both reflects the statutory text and promotes its underlying
purpose.
<p>1. <u>"Necessary"</u>
<p>In ordinary usage, the word "necessary" means essential or indispensable.<sup><a href="#N_71_">(71)</a></sup>
Thus, NTIA believes that a CLEC should gain access to a proprietary UNE
only if that UNE is essential to the provision of a telecommunications
service. The relevant question is simply this: Is it possible to provide
service without the requested element or a functional substitute for it?<sup><a href="#N_72_">(72)</a></sup>
If the answer is yes, the ILEC need not provide the proprietary element.
If the answer is no, the ILEC must make that element available if the impairment
standard is satisfied -- that is, if CLEC's ability to provide service
would be hindered by its inability to obtain that element (and its associated
features, functions, and capabilities) from the ILEC.
<p>2. <u>"Impair"</u>
<p>The word "impair" generally means "[t]o diminish in strength, value,
quantity, or quality."<sup><a href="#N_73_">(73)</a></sup> BellSouth contends
that "impair" is a "strong word" intended to "create a high threshold"
for unbundling.<sup><a href="#N_74_">(74)</a></sup> To the contrary, the
ordinary meaning of the word "impair" is highly elastic and thus gives
the Commission considerable freedom of interpretation, provided that it
heeds the Supreme Court's admonition that <i>any</i> diminution cannot
be deemed an impairment.
<p>NTIA recommends that, with respect to proprietary elements, the Commission
should identify a more stringent definition of impairment -- <i>e.g.</i>,
by requiring that a CLEC's inability to obtain a proprietary UNE from an
ILEC must impose a substantial penalty on the CLEC's ability to offer service,
in terms of cost, quality, or time to market.<sup><a href="#N_75_">(75)</a></sup>
That approach would give CLEC access to "necessary" proprietary elements
without unduly reducing the ILECs' incentives to develop and deploy innovative
facilities, features, and capabilities.
<p>With respect to nonproprietary elements, it would better advance the
goals of the 1996 Act for the Commission to prescribe a relatively low
threshold for finding impairment.<sup><a href="#N_76_">(76)</a></sup> As
noted above, Congress' fundamental objective in enacting that legislation
was to promote competition in all telecommunications markets by creating
entry opportunities for new service providers.<sup><a href="#N_77_">(77)</a></sup>
It recognized that new entrants would likely need assistance in their efforts
to breach the local exchange monopoly because of the considerable costs
of entry.<sup><a href="#N_78_">(78)</a></sup> Congress also understood
that competitors would likely need help to overcome "any unfair competitive
advantages accrued by companies that have benefitted from government-sanctioned
monopolies [<i>i.e.</i>, the ILECs]."<sup><a href="#N_79_">(79)</a></sup>
To that end, Congress created "fairly generous," even "promiscuous" unbundling
rights for the benefit of prospective local entrants.<sup><a href="#N_80_">(80)</a></sup>
The Commission should construe the word impair to accomplish that end.
<p>ILECs urge that the Commission must interpret "impair" to require material
or substantial differences in cost, quality, or time to market because
it is only those disparities that restrict a CLEC's "ability" to provide
service, as opposed to simply amassing profits.<sup><a href="#N_81_">(81)</a></sup>
The Commission should not adopt such a cramped reading of the phrase "ability
to provide service." In ordinary usage, "ability" means "the power, mental
or physical, to do something, and usually implies doing it well."<sup><a href="#N_82_">(82)</a></sup>
Like impair, "ability" has many shades of meaning and, thus, the Commission
has considerable latitude to select an interpretation that serves the goals
of the 1996 Act.
<p>The Commission could reasonably conclude that relatively small differences
in costs, quality, or time to market will impair a CLEC's ability to provide
service. To the extent that the inability to obtain a UNE from an ILEC
increases a CLEC's costs (for example, by forcing it to purchase a more
expensive substitute or by denying the CLEC the economies of scale, scope,
or density associated with the ILEC UNE), the resulting diminution in profits
will reduce the internal funds available to extend and upgrade the CLEC's
network and service offerings. It will also hinder the CLEC's ability to
attract outside capital for the same purposes. Similarly, decreases in
quality and delays in the introduction of CLEC services caused by the unavailability
of ILEC UNEs would give the ILEC valuable time to entrench itself with
existing customers, to use its unique access to most customers to gain
a foothold in new markets and, in markets where services may be offered
pursuant to long-term contracts (<i>e.g.</i>, DSL and other advanced data
services), to "lock up" customers in advance of competitive entry. Over
time, all of these disparities will impair a CLEC's ability to offer services
that consumers view as alternatives to the ILEC's offerings.<sup><a href="#N_83_">(83)</a></sup>
<p>For these reasons, NTIA recommends that the Commission establish a relatively
low threshold for determining impairment with respect to nonproprietary
elements. Thus, the Commission should conclude that the unavailability
of such network elements from an ILEC impairs a CLEC's ability to provide
service if the CLEC's self-provisioning of that element, or its securement
from another source, imposes a nontrivial penalty in terms of cost, service
quality, time to market, etc.<sup><a href="#N_84_">(84)</a></sup> The Commission
should treat as nontrivial any delay in service provisioning in excess
of six months (as compared to the time it would take for a CLEC to begin
provisioning a service using ILEC UNEs) and any cost increase in excess
of ten percent.
<p>Under this impairment standard, for example, the Commission or a State
commission could reasonably conclude that, as long as a CLEC can obtain
from an ILEC loop facilities and collocation space on reasonable terms
and on a timely basis, its ability to provide a competing DSL service would
not be impaired by the CLEC's inability to obtain digital subscriber line
access multiplexers (DSLAMs) from the ILEC on an unbundled basis. As NTIA
has previously noted, such equipment appears to be readily available to
ILECs and competitors alike. In many switching offices, provisioning of
DSLAMs does not appear to be characterized by such economies of scale as
to prevent a competitor from deploying such equipment over a limited customer
base at a cost comparable to that faced by an ILEC.<sup><a href="#N_85_">(85)</a></sup>
Accordingly, it would not be unreasonable for the Commission to conclude
that DSLAMs need not be provided by ILECs as UNEs in market areas where
competitors have fair and reasonable access to loops and collocation space.
<p><a NAME="IV."></a>IV. THE COMMISSION SHOULD SPECIFY A MINIMUM LIST OF
<br>UNBUNDLED ELEMENTS AND CREATE A "BEST PRACTICES"
<br>APPROACH THAT WILL PERMIT APPROPRIATE ADDITIONS
<br>TO THAT LIST OVER TIME WITHOUT
<br><u>THE NEED FOR COMMISSION ACTION.</u>
<p>NTIA strongly supports the Commission's tentative decision "to identify
a minimum set of network elements that must be unbundled on a nationwide
basis."<sup><a href="#N_86_">(86)</a></sup> The 1996 Act arguably requires
as much, given that section 251(d)(2) charges the Commission with "determining
what network elements should be made available for purposes of subsection
[251](c)(3)."<sup><a href="#N_87_">(87)</a></sup> The Commission has also
detailed the ways in which the specification of a national UNE list would
further the procompetitive purposes of the 1996 Act.<sup><a href="#N_88_">(88)</a></sup>
Although the Supreme Court disagreed with the way in which the Commission
arrived at its initial list of seven UNEs, it did not question the Commission's
authority to do so.
<p>A. <u>Specification of the National UNE List</u>
<p>The decisional question concerns what factors or standards that the
Commission must consider in fashioning such a national list. The Supreme
Court has held, of course, that in so doing the Commission must "giv[e]
some substance to the 'necessary' and 'impair' requirements" of section
251(d)(2).<sup><a href="#N_89_">(89)</a></sup> However the Commission chooses
to define those terms, section 251(d)(2) requires only that the Commission
"consider" those criteria in determining what network elements should be
made available.<sup><a href="#N_90_">(90)</a></sup> The Commission suggests
that this "means only that [the agency] must 'reach an express and considered
conclusion' about the bearing of a factor, but is not required 'to give
any specific weight' to it."<sup><a href="#N_91_">(91)</a></sup> More importantly,
the statute directs the Commission to consider the necessary and impair
standards "at a minimum," plainly indicating that the Commission may regard
-- and give weight to -- other factors.
<p>NTIA believes that one additional factor the Commission must consider
is the extent to which Congress may have mandated provision of particular
network elements on an unbundled basis. The evidence demonstrates that
Congress did more than simply specify the standards that the Commission
(and, to a lesser extent, State commissions) must use to identify particular
UNEs. In several instances, Congress appears to have applied those standards
itself and concluded that ILECs ought to provide unbundled access to certain
network elements. Thus, the Conference Report states that the "term 'network
element' was included [in the 1996 Act] to describe the facilities, such
as local loops, equipment, such as switching, and the features, functions,
and capabilities that [an ILEC] must provide for certain purposes under
other sections of the Act]."<sup><a href="#N_92_">(92)</a></sup>
<p>The best evidence of Congress' intent to require the unbundling of particular
network elements, in NTIA's view, is the so-called "competitive checklist"
in section 271(c)(2)(B). To be sure, ILECs contend that the checklist "applies
only to those BOCs that choose to apply for authority to provide in-region
interLATA services,"<sup><a href="#N_93_">(93)</a></sup> and thus "does
not create a minimum list of network elements to be unbundled under Section
251."<sup><a href="#N_94_">(94)</a></sup> Those arguments misperceive the
intended relationship between sections 251 and 271 and the common purpose
they were meant to serve.
<p>That common purpose, of course, was to open the ILECs' monopoly local
exchange networks to competition.<sup><a href="#N_95_">(95)</a></sup> Because
section 251(c) and the competitive checklist were designed to further the
same procompetitive ends, they contemplate similar obligations. Under the
House bill, those requirements were coextensive. Section 242(a)(2) imposed
upon local exchange carriers "[t]he duty to offer unbundled services, elements,
features, functions, and capabilities whenever technically feasible, at
just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory prices and in accordance with"
the Commission's implementing regulations.<sup><a href="#N_96_">(96)</a></sup>
Section 245(b)(2) specified that in order to gain authorization to provide
in-region interLATA services, a BOC would have to certify that it "provides
unbundled services, elements, features, functions, and capabilities in
accordance with" section 242(a)(2) and the Commission's regulations.<sup><a href="#N_97_">(97)</a></sup>
Indeed, not only were the unbundling and checklist obligations the same,
because the House bill contained no provision comparable to current section
251(d)(2), those obligations were limited only by considerations of technical
feasibility and by the requestor's willingness to pay the costs of the
elements requested.<sup><a href="#N_98_">(98)</a></sup>
<p>Under the Senate bill, the unbundling obligations were, at least potentially,
broader than the checklist requirements. In describing the latter requirements,
the Committee report emphasized that:
<blockquote>[t]he Committee does not intend the competitive checklist to
be a limitation on the interconnection requirements contained in section
251. Rather, the Committee intends the competitive checklist to set forth
what must, at a minimum, be provided by a [BOC] . . . before the FCC may
authorize the [BOC] to provide in region interLATA services.<sup><a href="#N_99_">(99)</a></sup></blockquote>
The principal sponsor of the Senate bill, Senator Pressler, described the
relationship between the checklist and the general unbundling provision
in similar terms:
<p>The competitive checklist . . . is intended to be a current reflection
of those things that a telecommunications carrier would need from a [BOC]
in order to provide a service such as telephone exchange service or exchange
access service in competition with the [BOC]. This competitive checklist
can best be described as a snapshot of what is required for these competitive
services now and in the reasonably foreseeable future. In other words,
these provisions open up the local loop from a technological standpoint
as [current section 253] opens up the local loop from a legal barrier to
entry standpoint. Section 251's "minimum [interconnection and unbundling]
requirements" permit regulatory flexibility and are not limited to a "snapshot"
of today's technology or requirements.<sup><a href="#N_100_">(100)</a></sup>
<p>Plainly, the Senate contemplated that the Commission would have the
authority under section 251 of the Senate bill to prescribe unbundling
obligations for ILECs that exceed those that the competitive checklist
mandated for the BOCs. If the Senate intended for the Commission to have
that broader authority under section 251, it follows that the Senate must
have meant for the Commission to have the lesser implied power to impose
the checklist's unbundling requirements on all ILECs.
<p>The language and structure of the House and Senate bills thus substantiate
the view that the Commission has authority under section 251(c)(3), at
a minimum, to require ILECs to give competitors unbundled access to any
network elements listed in the bills' respective competitive checklists.
In the absence of evidence to the contrary, one must assume that the House
and Senate conferees incorporated that common understanding into the compromise
bill that became the 1996 Act.
<p>The BOCs find that evidence in the fact that the section 271 checklist
contains both a cross-reference to the general unbundling requirements
in section 251(c)(3) and the requirement that a BOC provide several specified
network elements.<sup><a href="#N_101_">(101)</a></sup> Why would Congress
do that, they ask, if not to indicate that "a proper application of sections
251 and 252 might not yield the unbundling of <i>all</i> network elements
that Congress thought necessary" under section 271?<sup><a href="#N_102_">(102)</a></sup>
The companies answer their own question, however, when they note Congress'
understanding that a BOC could have applied for section 271 relief before
the Commission issued its rules implementing the market-opening requirements
of section 251(c).<sup><a href="#N_103_">(103)</a></sup> To foreclose the
possibility that BOCs could gain interLATA entry before fully opening their
local markets, Congress likely intended the specific items listed in the
checklist to serve as a minimum threshold for interLATA entry pending Commission
action under section 251(c)<sup><a href="#N_104_">(104)</a></sup>
<p>Thus, the preferred reading of section 251 and 271 is that the Commission
has authority, at a minimum, to designate the elements identified in the
competitive checklist as UNEs under section 251(c)(3).<sup><a href="#N_105_">(105)</a></sup>
Further, Congress' conclusion that provision of "checklist UNEs" is essential
to "open up the local loop [to competitive entry] from a technological
standpoint" strongly suggests that those elements should also be designated
under 251(c)(3) which, after all, is designed to serve the same market-opening
purposes. The Commission must "consider" that as it applies section 251(c)(3)
and section 252(d)(2) to determine what network elements should be made
available nationally.
<p>NTIA believes that the place to start in compiling a national UNE list
is with the elements that are either specifically mentioned in the competitive
checklist or are logically related to them. The seven items identified
in the <i>Local Competition Order</i> satisfy that standard. Five of those
elements -- loops, local switching, interoffice transmission facilities,
signaling and call-related databases, and operator services and directory
assistance -- are checklist items.<sup><a href="#N_106_">(106)</a></sup>
A sixth element -- the network interface device -- is properly considered
part of the loop and should be provided on an unbundled basis whenever
the loop itself must be unbundled.<sup><a href="#N_107_">(107)</a></sup>
Finally, even ILECs concede that CLECs must have unbundled access to ILEC
operations support systems because those systems are the irreplaceable
mechanism by which CLECs obtain the UNEs to which they are entitled.<sup><a href="#N_108_">(108)</a></sup>
<p>The Commission could reasonably require that those seven items must
be made available immediately nationwide, without any need for subsequent
proceedings, either at the Federal or State level, to confirm that those
UNEs satisfy the "necessary" and "impair" test or the other requirements
of the 1996 Act. In concluding that the listed items are necessary to open
the local exchange network to competition, Congress arguably applied the
statutory standards, determined that the items specified complied with
those requirements, and therefore required their provision on an unbundled
basis.<sup><a href="#N_109_">(109)</a></sup> Alternatively, as the comments
in the local competition rulemaking and this proceeding demonstrate, the
Commission can readily conclude that, for the foreseeable future, nationwide
provision of the seven UNEs identified in the <i>Notice</i> satisfies the
general requirements of section 251(c)(3) and any reasonable construction
of section 251(d)(2).<sup><a href="#N_110_">(110)</a></sup>
<p>B. <u>A "Best Practices" Model for Additions to the National UNE List</u>
<p>Although the 1996 Act charges the Commission, at least in the first
instance, with determining which network elements should be unbundled,<sup><a href="#N_111_">(111)</a></sup>
the statute also expressly preserves State commissions' authority to impose
additional access requirements that are consistent with the Federal regime.<sup><a href="#N_112_">(112)</a></sup>
Although the specification of a minimum national set of UNEs has many benefits,
it also has limitations. Most important is the risk that over time, the
national minimums might become a ceiling, or a shield that ILECs can use
to ward off additional unbundling obligations until the Commission moves
to expand the national norms.<sup><a href="#N_113_">(113)</a></sup>
<p>For that reason, NTIA commends the Commission's decision to continue
to permit State commissions to add network elements to the Commission's
minimum national list.<sup><a href="#N_114_">(114)</a></sup> State commissions
ought to be allowed to specify additional UNEs, at a CLEC's request, if
the CLEC can demonstrate that requiring unbundled access to that network
element would satisfy the statutory requirements. If, however, (1) a State
commission orders an ILEC to provide a particular UNE, or (2) an ILEC voluntarily
agrees to provide it, the Commission should create a rebuttable presumption
that such UNE should be made available nationwide. The burden would then
be on the ILEC to show that the provision of that UNE to another CLEC or
in another jurisdiction or geographical area would be inconsistent with
the terms of the Act and the Commission's implementing regulations. NTIA
believes that this "best practices" framework would bring the combined
expertise of Federal and State regulators to bear on the question of which
unbundling requirements can best promote the procompetitive goals of the
1996 Act. As importantly, it would create a dynamic process that would
allow developments throughout the industry to drive unbundling policies
forward.<sup><a href="#N_115_">(115)</a></sup>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="V."></a>V. THE COMMISSION SHOULD ESTABLISH PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS
FOR REMOVING UNBUNDLING OBLIGATIONS WHEN THEY BECOME
<u>UNNECESSARY.</u>
<p>Although Congress imposed broad-ranging unbundling obligations on ILECs,
it did not require that those obligations be either immutable or perpetual.
As the market-opening provisions of the 1996 Act succeed in stimulating
more and more competition, the point may come when the costs of the unbundling
(which are not insignificant) outweigh the incremental benefits. NTIA therefore
believes that the Commission should establish procedures and standards
for modifying the unbundling requirements under appropriate circumstances.
<p>The Commission should not, however, "sunset" those obligations upon
the mere passage of time.<sup><a href="#N_116_">(116)</a></sup> Indeed,
it lacks authority to do so. The text of the 1996 Act reveals that when
Congress wished to impose an obligation only for a period of months and
years, it knew how to draft the appropriate sunset language.<sup><a href="#N_117_">(117)</a></sup>
The absence of a sunset provision in section 251 can only mean that Congress
did not want one.<sup><a href="#N_118_">(118)</a></sup>
<p>Section 10 of the Communications Act does give the Commission broad
discretion to forbear from applying any provision of the Act if it determines
that continued enforcement of that provision is not necessary to (1) ensure
just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory charges and practices, (2) protect
consumers, and (3) promote the public interest.<sup><a href="#N_119_">(119)</a></sup>
The only specific limitation on the Commission's forbearance authority
under section 10 appears in subsection (d), which provides that "the Commission
may not forbear from applying the requirements of section 251(c) and 271
. . . until it determines that those requirements have been fully implemented."<sup><a href="#N_120_">(120)</a></sup>
The <i>Notice</i> solicits comments on the meaning of that provision and
the extent to which it may constrain the Commission's ability to limit
the section 251(c) unbundling requirements for ILECs.<sup><a href="#N_121_">(121)</a></sup>
<p>The text of section 10(d) does not reveal its meaning, and the associated
legislative history simply paraphrases the text.<sup><a href="#N_122_">(122)</a></sup>
On the other hand, the statute does suggest what it does not mean. Section
10 cannot reasonably be read to permit forbearance from applying section
251(c) to follow automatically from a BOC's compliance with section 271
and its entry into the interLATA market.<sup><a href="#N_123_">(123)</a></sup>
Section 10(d) excuses Commission enforcement of sections 251(c) and 271
only if the Commission determines that "those requirements have been fully
implemented." It does not say that implementation of one provision warrants
nullification of the other.<sup><a href="#N_124_">(124)</a></sup> Section
271, moreover, requires at most only modest local competition as a precondition
for interLATA entry.<sup><a href="#N_125_">(125)</a></sup> Consequently,
the level of competition that would warrant grant of a BOC application
under section 271 would not be sufficient, in most instances, to justify
forbearance under section 10.<sup><a href="#N_126_">(126)</a></sup>
<p>Section 10(d), however, does not preclude the Commission from taking
reasonable steps to loosen the ILECs' unbundling obligations under section
251(c) in appropriate circumstances. NTIA has argued, for example, that
the Commission could relax unbundling requirements with respect to advanced
data services such as DSL if it found that ILECs are giving competitors
"timely and nondiscriminatory access to <i>all</i> of the network elements
that they need to deploy competitive services."<sup><a href="#N_127_">(127)</a></sup>
NTIA recommends that the Commission explore further the scope of its forbearance
authority, with a view towards identifying the conditions under which it
would be appropriate to forbear from applying the unbundling requirements
in section 251(c)(3).
<p>An important aspect of that inquiry is how the Commission should exercise
whatever forbearance authority it might possess. NTIA suggests that the
Commission establish a forbearance process that will permit relaxation
of section 251 unbundling requirements when market conditions warrant.
One possible approach would be to allow greater flexibility in pricing
particular UNEs, rather than attempt to determine which portions of the
ILECs' networks should no longer be identified as UNE. As more and more
UNEs become available from non-ILEC sources, market forces should exert
downward pressures on the prices for those UNEs, thereby reducing the need
for strict price regulation of UNEs provided by ILECs.<sup><a href="#N_128_">(128)</a></sup>
Appropriate price signals are essential if CLECs are to make efficient
and socially beneficial choices among the entry choices made available
to them by the 1996 Act. Pricing of telecommunications services is a complex
process that may not produce rates that replicate the prices that would
prevail in a competitive market. NTIA therefore recommends that, when circumstances
justify forbearance, the Commission consider reducing the ILECs' unbundling
responsibilities under the Act by relaxing the pricing standards applicable
to UNEs.
<p>As for the circumstances that could justify forbearance, the Commission
should seek to craft standards that are clear, certain, and predictable.
ILECs and CLECs alike must be able to determine what level of unbundling
is required/available in particular markets so that they can rationally
plan their businesses. In NTIA's view, the essential precondition for forbearance
is the presence within the relevant market area of sufficient competition
to ensure that loosening of the unbundling requirements will not harm competition
or consumers. The comments in this proceeding have identified a number
of factors that should be considered in determining whether adequate competition
exists. The most important of those factors concerns supply conditions
within the relevant market: Whether there are non-ILEC suppliers of UNEs
in the market; Whether those suppliers have facilities in those parts of
the market where CLECs seek to offer service; Whether alternative suppliers
are willing and able to supply the UNEs that CLECs request and in sufficient
quantities to enable competitors to deploy their desired services to their
chosen customer base;<sup><a href="#N_129_">(129)</a></sup> Whether the
costs, quality, and provisioning intervals of those UNEs comparable to
elements obtainable from the serving ILEC.
<p>The Commission cannot reasonably determine the state of competition
in the market by simply counting the number of competitors. In particular,
the presence of a single competitive provider of a particular UNE cannot
<i>ipso facto</i> justify relaxation of an ILEC's obligation to provide
that UNE upon request, as most ILECs contend.<sup><a href="#N_130_">(130)</a></sup>
The operative principle cannot be: If one CLEC provides its own element
somewhere within a market area, other CLECs must do so everywhere. That
is not only antithetical to basic notions of competitive markets, but also
is inconsistent with Congress' conclusion that UNEs are a necessary springboard
for competitive entry because the costs of facilities-based entry are excessive
for most new providers.<sup><a href="#N_131_">(131)</a></sup>
<p>On the other hand, if in serving a particular market segment or customer
group (<i>e.g.</i>, business subscribers), a significant number of CLECs
(<i>e.g.</i>, three or more in addition to the serving ILEC) are providing
a certain network element on a facilities-basis within a market area, one
may question whether society should continue to incur the costs involved
in ensuring that those elements are also available from an ILEC. Linking
forbearance to the presence of multiple self-providing CLECs will provide
greater assurances that removal of the ILECs' unbundling obligations for
specific UNEs will not occur without evidence that self-provisioning is
a feasible option for a variety of CLECs, not simply the largest or best-capitalized.
Requiring multiple CLECs may also increase the likelihood that a wholesale
market for particular UNEs will arise before the ILECs' duty to provide
them terminates.
<p>Another important part of the foregoing competition analysis is the
availability of reasonable and timely collocation opportunities for CLECs.
CLECs' ability to acquire certain UNEs from non-LEC sources will not enable
CLECs to provide competing telecommunications services unless they can
connect those self-provided elements to the UNEs that they must obtain
from the ILECs. Collocation -- whether physical or virtual -- is the congressionally
designated mechanism by which CLECs gain access to ILEC network elements.<sup><a href="#N_132_">(132)</a></sup>
Consequently, the Commission should not grant any ILEC forbearance petition
unless the ILEC demonstrates that it is in full compliance with its collocation
obligations under the 1996 Act, the Commission's regulations, and any State
commission requirements.

UNEs "to <i>any</i> requesting telecommunications carrier." 47 U.S.C. &sect;
251(c)(3) (Supp. II 1996) (emphasis added). The legislative history, moreover,
is replete with statements indicating that Congress sought to expand competition
by maximizing entry opportunities by individual competitors. <i>See</i>,
<i>e.g.</i>, S. Rep. No. 104-23, at 5 (1995) (hereinafter Senate Report)
(Senate bill requires ILECs "to open and unbundle network features and
functions to allow any customer or carrier to interconnect with the carrier's
facilities"); House Report at 48, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 11 (House bill "promotes
competition in the market for local telephone service by requiring local
telephone companies . . . to offer competitors access to parts of their
networks"); 142 Cong. Rec. S700 (daily ed. Feb. 1, 1996) (statement of
Sen. Burns) ("rules on interconnection will empower competitors by ensuring
that they can gain access on fair and reasonable terms to existing local
telephone facilities"); 141 Cong. Rec. H8464 (daily ed. Aug. 4, 1995) (statement

ed. Aug. 2, 1995) (statement of Rep. Bliley) (House bill requires ILECs
"to open the local exchange network to competitors seeking to offer local

foster entry by multiple firms and then let competitive market processes
distinguish the "efficient" providers from the "inefficient" ones.

Section 271 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, To Provide In-Region,

Markets, <i>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Notice of Inquiry in WT Docket
No. 99-217 and Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in CC Docket
No. 96-98</i>, WT Docket No. 99-217, CC Docket No. 96-98, FCC 99-141, &para;
23 (rel July 7, 1999) (hereinafter <i>Local Competition Rulemaking</i>).
<p><a NAME="N_19_"></a>19. NTIA has expressed concern that the Commission's
chosen methodology for fixing the price of interconnection and UNEs, and
for determining the discount applicable to resold ILEC service -- Total
Element Long Run Incremental Cost (TELRIC) -- if rigidly applied, may produce
prices that do not accurately reflect the costs of providing the service
or arrangement in question. <i>See</i> Reply Comments of the National Telecommunications
and Information Administration in CC Docket No. 96-98 at 18-25 (filed May
30, 1996) (NTIA Reply Comments). If TELRIC-based pricing were to produce
unreasonably low UNE rates, the aggressive unbundling framework that Congress
enacted could induce artificially CLECs to enter the local market via UNEs,
as opposed to, for example, facilities-based entry. It could also reduce
incentives for ILECs and others to invest in advanced telecommunications
facilities and networks.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The experience gained from State arbitrations conducted over the past
three years suggests that, in practice, the TELRIC standard may be flexible
enough to avoid these problems. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>US West Communication,
Inc. v. Jennings</i>, CV97-26-PHX-RGS-OMP, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6821,
at *7-*8 (D. Ariz. May 4, 1999) ("Because TELRIC focuses on a mythical
network instead of [the ILEC's] existing network, each party was free to
offer its own vision of this mythical network, limited only by the party's
audacity and its ability to procure an expert witness willing to endorse
that party's vision."). The Commission should continue to monitor the situation.
<i>See Local Competition Rulemaking</i> &para; 16. NTIA also recommends
that the Commission give States sufficient flexibility in applying the
national TELRIC methodology so that CLECs will continue to make efficient
choices among the entry alternatives that the 1996 Act affords them. <i>See</i>,
<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Southwestern Bell Telephone Company v. AT&amp;T Communications
off the Southwest, Inc.</i>, No. A 97-CA-132 SS, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
15637, at *38 (W. D. Tex. Aug. 31, 1998) (approving Texas Public Utility
Commission's decision to adopt its variation of TELRIC "which takes into
account [ILEC's] existing network routes, wire center locations, and 'Texas-specific
data' such as 'the costs associated with construction and rights-of-way
that [ILEC] actually incurs in the laying of its network.'").
<p><a NAME="N_20_"></a>20. The Commission has previously held that the
unbundling and other market-opening provisions of the 1996 Act are not
applicable only to voice or circuit-switched services. <i>See</i> Deployment
of Wireline Services Offering Advanced Telecommunications Capability,
<i>Memorandum

24032-24034, &para;&para; 40-44 (1998) (hereinafter <i>First Section 706
Order</i>). It should specifically reaffirm that determination here.
<p><a NAME="N_21_"></a>21. [T]he Commission shall forbear from applying
any regulation or provision of this Act to a telecommunications carrier
or telecommunications service, or class of telecommunications carrier or
telecommunications service, in any or some of its of their geographic markets,
if the Commission determines that --
<p>(1) enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary to
ensure that the charges' practices, classifications, or regulations by,
for, or in connection with that telecommunications carrier or telecommunications
service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory;
<p>(2) enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary for
the protection of consumers; and
<p>(3) forbearance from applying such provision or regulation is consistent

501 U.S. 868, 873 (1991) (when a court "find[s] the terms of a statute

may not substitute its construction of the text for a reasonable interpretation

<br>&nbsp;
<p>ILECs cite the passage quoted in the text as evidence that Congress
"had the essential facilities doctrine in mind when it adopted the unbundling
requirement." Ameritech Comments at 31. <i>See also</i> GTE Comments at
15. The text does not even suggest, however, that the House Committee was
using the phrase "essential facilities" in its technical sense. Further,
the ILECs do not account for the fact that the second sentence of the quoted
passage (which the ILECs do not cite) seems to contemplate the unbundling
of elements (<i>e.g.</i>, switching and signalling) that the ILECs now
claim, based upon an essential facilities analysis, do not need to be unbundled
in many instances. Finally, Congress' finding in 1995 that the ILECs' networks
are essential facilities to which competitors must have access cannot be
squared with the ILECs' contention that the decision to unbundle a particular
UNE must turn on some future determination of "essentiality."
<p><a NAME="N_44_"></a>44. Mr. Justice Breyer speculated that the 1996
Act's generalized specification of the ILECs' unbundling obligations "reflect[s]
congressional uncertainty about the extent to which compelled use of an
[ILEC's] facilities will prove necessary to avoid waste." <i>AT&amp;T Corp.</i>,
119 S.Ct. at 753. More likely, Congress opted for general language to give
the Commission some latitude to identify new UNEs as the ILECs' networks
and competitors' needs change. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, 141 Cong. Rec.
S8468 (daily ed. June 15, 1995) (statement of Sen. Pressler) ("[C]ompetitive
checklist [in section 271(c)(2)(B)] could best be described as a snapshot
of what is required for these competitive [local exchange] services now
and in the reasonably foreseeable future . . . [s]ection 251's 'minimum
standards' permit regulatory flexibility and are not limited to a 'snapshot'
of today's technology or requirements").
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Justice Breyer correctly identified the costs of unlimited unbundling:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Rules that force firms to share <i>every</i> resource or element of
a business would create, not competition, but pervasive regulation. . .
. A totally unbundled world -- a world in which competitors share every
part of an incumbent's existing system, including, say, billing, advertising,
sales staff, and work force (and in which regulators set all unbundling
charges) -- is a world in which competitors would have little, if anything,
to compete about.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>AT&amp;T Corp.</i>, 119 S.Ct. at 754. But the 1996 Act does not create
such a world. It mandates unbundling only of network elements -- defined
as facilities and equipment and their associated functions and capabilities.
<i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &sect; 153(29) (Supp. II 1996). In the main, therefore,
the Act requires only "the sharing of readily separable and administrable
physical facilities." <i>AT&amp;T Corp.</i>, 119 S.Ct. at 753. While the
Act arguably does compel the sharing of personnel in some instances (<i>e.g.</i>,
operators, technicians involved in provisioning, repairing, and maintaining
UNEs), that sharing occurs only when an ILEC is obliged to furnish some
facility or equipment as a UNE. The Act does not authorize widescale sharing
of ILEC personnel, advertising, research facilities, or firm management.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Finally, Justice Breyer was right to note that unbundling "does not
automatically mean increased competition. It is in the <i>un</i>shared,
not in the shared, portions of the enterprise that meaningful competition
would likely emerge." <i>Id.</i> at 754. It is nevertheless true that even
a fairly broad unbundling requirement can give competitors room to innovate,
for example, in the services that they can create using those elements,
or in the way that they price, package, and market the services they create.

conclusion. <i>See</i> Ameritech Comments at 13 ("If entrants could change
the bulb using their own (or someone else's) ladder, even if they had to
stretch their arms to full extension, . . . failure to obtain access to
[the ILEC's] ladder would not 'impair' the entrants' ability to offer the
services they seek to provide."); BellSouth's Comments at 11 ("The Court's
analogy was that as long as the light bulb could still be changed, the
incumbent's longer ladder was neither necessary nor would its absence impair
the CLEC."). What the court actually said was: "the proper analogy . .
. [is] the presence of a ladder tall enough to enable one to do the job,
but not without stretching one's arm to its full extension. A ladder one-half
inch taller is not . . . 'necessary,' nor does its absence 'impair' one's

inch difference was of no more significance than a one percent decrease
in profits. The Court did not even intimate that larger differences in
length (or reductions in profits) would likewise be of no consequence.

<p><a NAME="N_74_"></a>74. BellSouth's Comments at 9. Ameritech demonstrates
that if one searches long enough, it is possible to find a definition of
any word that better suits one's interests -- in this case, to argue that
"impair" requires a material diminution. Ameritech Comments at 33 (citing
<i>Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary</i>). A less result-oriented
exploration reveals that materiality is not generally considered to be
a necessary condition for impairment.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Ameritech also tries to make something of the fact that the only Justice
who supported the Commission's interpretation of impair, Mr. Justice Souter,
conceded that the Commission construed the term in its "weak" sense. Ameritech
Comments at 33 n.83. But, as noted above, the Court majority objected to
the Commission's "weak" reading only insofar as it was used to find that
<i>any</i> increase in cost or reduction in quality constitutes an impairment.
<p><a NAME="N_75_"></a>75. The 100 percent cost penalty alluded to in the
<i>Notice</i> is well beyond any reasonable impairment standard, even for
proprietary elements. <i>Notice</i> &para; 26 ("[i]f the cost of obtaining
a network element from the incumbent LEC is half the cost of obtaining
it from another source, should the incumbent be required to unbundle it?").
<p><a NAME="N_76_"></a>76. Because the statute does not specify separate
impair standards for proprietary and nonproprietary elements, the ordinary
assumption is that Congress intended the same test to apply to both categories
of UNEs. <i>Cf</i>. <i>National Credit Union Administration v. First National
Bank &amp; Trust Co.</i>, 522 U.S. 479, 501 (1998) ("similar language contained
within the same section of a statute must be accorded a consistent meaning").
The Commission could reasonably "consider," however, that society's interest
in preserving and promoting innovation warrants a different, and stiffer,
impair standard for proprietary elements. <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &sect; 251(d)(2).

<p><a NAME="N_83_"></a>83. The Court's discussion of ladders and light
bulbs does not address this essential point (and, of course, overlooks
the fact that ladders are more readily available than network elements).
A CLEC that requests a "ladder" from an ILEC is not trying to replace a
single light bulb. It is in the <i>business</i> of changing light bulbs.
As such, it will need to change many light bulbs at many different job
sites. It competes, moreover, against an ILEC whose ladders enable its
workers to do their jobs with maximum ease and comfort. If the CLEC's inability
to use the ILEC's ladders relegates it to using ladders that are shorter,
heavier, less sturdy, the CLEC's workers will likely be slower, less productive,
and more accident-prone than their ILEC counterparts. Over time, those
differences will surely impair the CLEC's ability to compete in the bulb
changing business.
<p><a NAME="N_84_"></a>84. Put another way, the Commission should accept
the Supreme Court's implicit invitation to select an impairment standard
rather close to the one that the Court overturned.

<p><a NAME="N_104_"></a>104. The BOCs also argue that if Congress had wanted
to create a minimum list of UNEs, it would have done so in section 251(c)(3),
which applies to all ILECs, rather than section 271, which pertains only
to the BOCs. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, Ameritech Comments at 50-51; Bell
Atlantic Comments at 19. On the other hand, because the checklist was meant
to specify the minimum standards that a certain group of firms -- the BOCs
-- must comply with in order to gain a particular form of regulatory relief
-- freedom to offer interLATA services -- it makes sense to include that
specification in the provision of the 1996 Act that governs the granting
of such relief to those carriers -- section 271. That would be true even
if the checklist requirements were intended to have more general applicability.
Congress also may have opted for a general statement of the ILECs' unbundling
obligations in section 251(c)(3) out of concern that a listing of particular
UNEs, even coupled with more general unbundling language, could create
an inference that the Commission had only limited authority to designate
others. <i>Cf</i>. <i>United States v. Espy</i>, 145 F.3d 1369, 1371 (D.C.
Cir. 1998) ("Where a general term follows a list of specific terms, the
rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i> limits the general term as referring only
to items of the same category.").
<p><a NAME="N_105_"></a>105. NTIA believes that the Commission's authority
to designate particular UNEs also gives it considerable latitude in defining
the scope of the ILECs' unbundling obligations with respect to that network
element. Thus, for example, the Commission's power to identify loops as
UNEs carries with it the authority to indicate which loops must be provided
and how. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>First Section 706 Order</i>, 13 FCC

<p>If the Commission is reluctant to mandate nationwide availability of
the seven UNEs, it should at least create a presumption that all ILECs
must offer those elements everywhere upon request. <i>See</i> Comments
of the New York Department of Public Service at 2. ILECs would then have
an opportunity in specific arbitrations to demonstrate by clear and convincing
evidence that an item on the presumptive national list should not be made
available to a requesting CLEC because such provisioning would not meet
the requirements of sections 251(c)(3) and (d)(2), as construed herein.

as a result of the Commission's collocation policies).
<p><a NAME="N_114_"></a>114. <i>Notice</i> &para; 14. On the other hand,
if the Commission has mandated that one or more UNEs be provided nationwide,
as NTIA believes that it should, the Commission should not permit State
commissions to remove items from that list. <i>Id</i>. &para; 38. The statute
would seem to bar State commission from doing so on their own initiative.
Section 251(d)(3) authorizes State commission to prescribe additional unbundling
obligations on ILECs only if those requirements (1) are consistent with
section 251 and (2) and "do[] not substantially prevent implementation"
of section 251 and its underlying purposes. 47 U.S.C. &sect; 251(d)(3)(B),
(C) (Supp. II 1996). In order for the Commission to designate a UNE for
provisioning nationwide, it must determine that such action is consistent
with the statute and its goals. The plain language of section 251(d)(3)
would thus bar State rulings to the contrary. Further, even assuming the
Commission has authority to delegate to the States its power to remove
UNEs from the national list, there are sound policy reasons why it should
not exercise that authority. <i>See</i> Illinois Comments at 3-4.
<p><a NAME="N_115_"></a>115. The Commission should reinforce the process
by revisiting its national minimum requirements periodically.

<p><a NAME="N_123_"></a>123. <i>See</i> <i>Notice</i> &para; 37. Conversely,
a Commission decision pursuant to section 10 to refrain from applying a
section 251(c) requirement cannot reduce a BOC's obligation to comply fully
with section 271 in order to gain interLATA entry. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>,
47 U.S.C. &sect; 271(d)(4) (Supp. II 1996) ("Commission may not, by rule
<i>or otherwise</i>, limit or extend" the section 271 competitive checklist)
(emphasis added). <i>See also</i> Letter from Larry Irving, NTIA, to Chairman
William Kennard, CC Docket No. 98-147, at 6 n.26 (Jan. 11, 1999) (NTIA
January 11 Letter).
<p><a NAME="N_124_"></a>124. This conclusion is consistent with Congress'
understanding that while section 271 sets the minimum prerequisites for
BOC provision of in-region interLATA services, section 251 establishes
broader interconnection obligations that would continue even after interLATA
entry. <i>See</i> notes 99-100 and accompanying text.

<p><a NAME="N_126_"></a>126. Of course, if a BOC's interLATA application
is granted, and includes the presence of robust competition in a portion
of a State, grant of that application could provide the Commission with
a basis for forbearing from enforcing section 251(c)(3) obligations in
that same part of the State.

<p><a NAME="N_128_"></a>128. It is also worth noting, in this regard, that
the ILECs' objections to the Commission's unbundling rules appear to stem
not from unbundling <i>per se</i> but rather from unbundling at TELRIC-mandated
rates. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, Ameritech Comments at 24, 26; Bell Atlantic
Comments at 10, 11, 13; SBC Comments at 5, 6. <i>See also</i> <i>Iowa Utils.
Bd.</i>, 120 F.3d at 816 (ILECs' arguments against Commission's unbundling
rules "are generally based on the assumption that [those rules] would operate
in conjunction with the Commission's proposed pricing rules"). It also
may be no accident that Justice Breyer's criticisms of the Commission's
unbundling regime immediately followed his expressed reservations about
the pricing methodology selected. <i>AT&amp;T Corp.</i>, 119 S.Ct. at 752-754
(Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).
<p><a NAME="N_129_"></a>129. The Commission should bear in mind that some
competitors may choose not to make their facilities available to other
competitors to forestall the removal of unbundling obligations on the serving
ILEC. Where such regulatory gamesmanship occurs, the Commission should
not allow it to influence the Commission's forbearance analysis.
<p><a NAME="N_130_"></a>130. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, Bell Atlantic Comments
at 14 ("fact that at least one competitor is using its own element to provide
competing telecommunications service is sufficient proof that it can be
done and that competitors do not need that element from incumbents"); USTA
Comments at 33 ("[i]f at least one CLEC is supplying the element in question,"
ILECs should not be required to furnish it); US West Comments at 12 ("[e]vidence
that one or more CLECs are obtaining an element in a geographic market
from non-ILEC sources conclusively demonstrates that mandatory unbundling
of that element is not appropriate in that market").
<p><a NAME="N_131_"></a>131. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, Conference Report,
at 148, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 160 ("it is unlikely that competitors will
have a fully redundant network in place when they initially offer local
service, because the investment necessary is so significant"); House Report,
at 49, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 13 ("inability of other service providers to
gain access to the local telephone companies equipment inhibits competition
that could otherwise develop in the local exchange market").
<p><a NAME="N_132_"></a>132. <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &sect; 251(c)(6) (Supp.
II 1996). Congress concluded that collocation was necessary to ensure reasonable
and nondiscriminatory access to ILECs' networks because "the risk of discriminatory
interconnection grows the farther one gets away from the [ILEC] central
office." House Report, at 73, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 39. The statute plainly
makes virtual collocation the preferred alternative when demonstrated space
limitations prevent the ILEC from providing physical collocation.
