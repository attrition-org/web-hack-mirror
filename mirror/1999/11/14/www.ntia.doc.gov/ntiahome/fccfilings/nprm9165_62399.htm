<p><a NAME="EXECUTIVE SUMMARY"></a><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b></center>

<p>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
applauds the Commission for its efforts in implementing the international
Global Mobile Personal Communications by Satellite Memorandum of Understanding
(GMPCS MOU) which will support the deployment of GMPCS service in the United
States and around the world. As discussed in these comments, NTIA remains
concerned about a number of issues vital to the future needs and operations
of the Federal aeronautical radionavigation community and implementation
of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and its constituent elements
the United States Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian Federation
Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS).
<p>The GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS) Signal Specification has
been amended in recognition that many civil GPS receivers utilize the entire
transmitted bandwidth of the Coarse/Acquisition code signal to minimize
tracking errors due to noise, interference, and multipath. NTIA requests
that the Commission modify Section 25.213(b) of the Commission's Rules,
47 C.F.R. &sect; 25.213(b), to reflect the amended SPS Signal Specification
by replacing the current frequency range of 1574.397-1576.443 MHz with
the new frequency range of 1563.42-1587.42 MHz.
<p>In the study performed by RTCA Special Committee 159 (SC-159), it was
concluded that GLONASS requires the same level of interference protection
as GPS. This conclusion supports NTIA's recommendation that a wideband
limit of -70 dBW/MHz and a narrowband limit of -80 dBW is required to protect
aircraft reception of GLONASS signals in the 1597-1605 MHz portion of the
band.
<p>NTIA believes that as a result of the limited carrier-to-noise density
margin, the higher interference levels associated with Category II/III
precision approach landing, and the potential of multiple interfering sources,
the susceptibility levels for GNSS receivers cannot be reduced from the
level used to develop the proposed out-of-band emission limits for mobile-satellite
service (MSS) terminals operating in the 1610-1660.5 MHz band. Moreover,
NTIA does not believe that interference suppression techniques should be
used as a substitute for GNSS receiver protection limits.
<p>NTIA agrees with the Commission's proposal to specify the narrowband
out-of-band emission limit for MSS terminals as an absolute level of -80
dBW. It is appropriate to specify narrowband emissions in terms of an absolute
power level and it is consistent with the recommendation made by RTCA SC-159.
<p>NTIA believes that it is beneficial to MSS operators and GNSS receiver
manufacturers to establish out-of-band emission limits in the 1605-1610
MHz band instead of resolving interference on a case-by-case basis. Therefore,
NTIA recommends that the Commission adopt the out-of-band emission limits
established by the International Telecommunications Union - Radiocommunication
Sector (ITU-R) and the European Testing and Standards Institute (ETSI)
in the 1605-1610 MHz portion of the band.
<p>NTIA agrees with the Commission that design decisions should be left
to the MSS system providers. NTIA believes that if the Commission adopts
rules that will require all MSS terminals operating in the 1610-1660.5
MHz band to meet the wideband limit of -70 dBW/MHz and the narrowband limit
of -80 dBW in the 1559-1605 MHz by January 1, 2005, approval of hardware/software
configurations would not be necessary.
<p>The NTIA Petition proposed that out-of-band emission power levels should
be averaged over a 20 millisecond time interval. This power level was based
on the symbol duration of the GPS navigation message. Since the NTIA petition
was filed, the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) has continued to develop.
The WAAS signal will augment GPS to obtain the required accuracy improvement
for precision approaches, as well as integrity, continuity, and availability
of navigation for all phases of flight. Because the WAAS transmits more
data than GPS it has a symbol duration that is 10 times shorter than a
GPS data symbol, making WAAS more susceptible to pulsed interfering signals.
As a result of this increased susceptibility to pulsed interference, NTIA
proposes that the out-of-band emissions for MSS systems employing Time
Division Multiple Access (TDMA) techniques be averaged over a time interval
of duration that is equal to the length of the transmission time slot.
This would only apply to future MSS systems employing TDMA. For existing
MSS systems employing TDMA the 20 millisecond averaging time interval should
be used.
<p>NTIA disagrees agree with the Commission's assertion that Little LEO
terminals operating in compliance with Section 25.202(f) of the Commission's
Rules, 47 C.F.R. &sect; 25.202(f), will not exceed the wideband and narrowband
limits proposed by NTIA in the 1559-1610 MHz band.
<p>NTIA recommends that the Commission adopt a limit for the carrier-off
state of an MSS earth terminal that is 10 dB lower than the carrier-on
limit to account for a cumulative power effect.
<p>NTIA believes that based on the continuing evolution of the 1559-1610
MHz band that it would be ill-advised to waive or postpone the 2002 compliance
date for new non-geostationary MSS terminals that is proposed in NTIA's
petition. However, NTIA does agree that there is some uncertainty for the
date of domestic implementation of GLONASS. The status of GLONASS implementation
should be reviewed in the 2005 timeframe and the date for invoking the
final stages of compliance can be adjusted accordingly.
<p>NTIA proposes that geostationary MSS terminals operating in the 1626.5-1660.5
MHz band that are brought into service after January 1, 2002, be required
to comply with the final emission limits of -70 dBW/MHz and -80 dBW. Geostationary
MSS terminals that are currently in service or those brought onto service
prior to January 1, 2002 should be permitted to operate at their current
out-of-band emission levels until January 1, 2005. NTIA believes that this
will lessen the burden on manufacturers allowing them adequate time to
redesign their terminals to comply with the final emission limits.
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA believes that a user in need of emergency
assistance should receive help independent of which type of wireless device
that person is using. This should be independent of whether the network
is terrestrially based like cellular or PCS or satellite-based like GMPCS.
Since the ability to locate users in distress is in the public's best interest,
NTIA supports position location capabilities for GMPCS terminals authorized
for use in the United States.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA requests clarification regarding the
types of earth terminals that are to be exempted from the certification
requirement proposed by the Commission in this NPRM. NTIA does not object
to the Commission expanding the types of terminals considered under the
GMPCS-MoU to include semi-fixed and fixed terminals. Such action, however,
would require that national and international standards similar to those
adopted for the MSS earth terminals be developed for the essential technical
parameters of semi-fixed and fixed GMPCS earth terminals.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is
considering developing interference susceptibility standards for maritime
RNSS receivers. The results of the work performed by the USCG may have
to be considered in a future rulemaking on the uses of RNSS other than
aeronautical.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The National Science Foundation (NSF) requests
that the Commission explicitly document in a Report and Order the protection
of radio astronomy operations in the 1610-1613.8 MHz band. NSF is also
concerned that the out-of-band emissions of MSS earth terminals operating
below 1660 MHz may cause interference to radio astronomy observations in
the 1660-1670 MHz band. Based on further studies and experience it may
be necessary to revisit this issue and request tighter out-of-band emission
standards or to introduce other measures.</font>

<center><b><u><font face="Times New Roman">COMMENTS OF THE NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS</font></u></b>
<br><b><u><font face="Times New Roman">AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION</font></u></b></center>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA), an Executive Branch agency within the Department
of Commerce, is the President's principal adviser on domestic and international
telecommunications policy, including policies relating to the Nation's
economic and technological advancement in telecommunications. Accordingly,
NTIA makes recommendations regarding telecommunications policies and presents
Executive Branch views on telecommunications matters to the Congress, the
Federal Communications Commission, and the public. NTIA, through the Office
of Spectrum Management, is also responsible for managing the Federal Government's
use of the radio frequency spectrum. NTIA respectively submits the following
Comments in response to the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
in the above-captioned proceeding.<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup></font>
<p><a NAME="I."></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">I. INTRODUCTION</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In October 1994, the Commission issued
a Report and Order establishing rules for the "Big LEO" service, <i>i.e.</i>,
voice-and-data mobile satellite service (MSS) provided by non-geostationary
satellites accessed by mobile terminals transmitting in segments of the
1610-1626.5 MHz band.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup> The rules included
out-of-band emission limits to protect reception of the Global Positioning
System (GPS) Coarse/Acquisition (C/A) signals.<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup>
Although U.S. consultations with Russian officials indicated a likelihood
that the Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) would shift to frequencies
below 1605 MHz by the year 2005, the Commission acknowledged that emissions
from Big LEO terminals could potentially interfere with GLONASS reception
below 1610 MHz in the interim. The Commission refrained from adopting specific
out-of-band limits to protect GLONASS, however, leaving the issue to be
resolved after further study.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In November 1994, representatives of the
Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the NTIA signed
a Memorandum of Understanding ("1994 MOU") concerning domestic implementation
of a GPS/GLONASS Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup>
The 1994 MOU declared that the Commission would consider adopting pertinent
out-of-band emissions limits for MSS terminals recommended by the RTCA,<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup>
and that licenses for MSS terminals operating in the bands near the GPS
and GLONASS bands issued prior to a U.S. decision to implement GLONASS
domestically would indicate that the licensees would be bound by any such
limits subsequently incorporated in the Commission's rules. The MOU pertained
to all MSS terminals transmitting on assigned frequencies between 1610
and 1660.5 MHz.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In January 1997, Special Committee 159,
the RTCA committee that had been commissioned pursuant to the 1994 MOU
to study the potential for harmful interference with GNSS operation, issued
its final report.<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup> The aviation and MSS
participants agreed that a wideband equivalent isotropically radiated power
(EIRP) limit of -70 dBW/MHz and a narrowband EIRP limit of -80 dBW would
protect aircraft reception of GPS signals, and the MSS participants agreed
that it was feasible for them to meet those limits in the GPS Coarse/Acquisition
signal band. No consensus, however, was reached regarding limits for the
protection of GLONASS operations. The aviation representatives maintained
that a -70 dBW/MHz wideband limit and a -80 dBW narrowband limit were necessary.
The MSS representatives maintained that it was economically infeasible
for them to suppress emissions in the GLONASS band to that extent and argued
that limits of -54 dBW/MHz for wideband emission and -64 dBW for narrowband
emissions would be adequate. As a result of this lack of consensus, RTCA
SC-159 did not issue a recommendation for the out-of-band emissions to
protect GLONASS.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">After the release of the RTCA report, interested
private sector parties and officials at the Commission, the NTIA, and the
FAA conducted informal discussions concerning emission limits for the protection
of GNSS in the United States. At the culmination of those discussions,
NTIA filed the petition for rulemaking that is in part the subject of this
GMPCS NPRM.<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup> The NTIA Petition reflects
a compromise proposal worked out by the NTIA, the FAA, and the representatives
of Big LEO MSS systems. Under the proposal set forth in the NTIA Petition,
the out-of-band emission standard that the aviation members of RTCA SC-159
had recommended would be adopted for the protection of aircraft reception
of GLONASS signals between 1597 and 1605 MHz, but there would be an initial
grace period during which less restrictive limits would apply for emissions
in that portion of the band, and no specific limits were proposed for protection
of GLONASS reception on frequencies above 1605 MHz.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">For protection of GPS reception, the NTIA
Petition recommended requiring that all MSS terminals transmitting on frequencies
between 1610 MHz and 1660.5 MHz conform to two restrictions: a wideband
limit of -70 dBW/MHz, averaged over 20 milliseconds on the EIRP density
of the out-of-band emissions in the 1559-1580.42 MHz frequency range; and
a narrowband limit of -80 dBW/700 Hz, also averaged over 20 milliseconds
on emissions in the 1559-1585.42 MHz frequency range.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The NTIA Petition also recommended a three-phased
approach for protection of aircraft reception of GLONASS to ease the initial
burden of compliance for MSS operators. In the first phase, MSS terminals
transmitting on frequencies in the 1610-1626.5 MHz band that are placed
into service prior to January 1, 2002 must, in addition to meeting the
requirements described in the preceding paragraph, immediately meet an
interim EIRP density limit of -64 dBW/MHz for wideband emissions in the
1580.42-1605 MHz range and a narrowband EIRP density limit of -74 dBW/700
Hz in the 1585.42-1605 MHz range. In the second phase, all MSS terminals
licensed for operation on frequencies between 1610 and 1660.5 MHz commissioned
after January 1, 2002 must meet limits of -70 dBW/MHz and -80 dBW/700 Hz
throughout the 1559-1605 MHz band without relying on software restriction
of operating frequencies. In the third phase, MSS terminals commissioned
before January 1, 2002 must be deactivated as of January 1, 2005 unless
they are altered by then, as necessary, to conform to the -70/-80 limits
throughout the 1559-1605 MHz band.<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA also recommended that any issue concerning
potential interference with reception of GLONASS signals in the U.S. territory
on frequencies above 1605 MHz should be addressed on a case-by-case basis.<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Since NTIA filed its petition for rulemaking,
the Commission proposed voluntary interim equipment certification procedures
to be used prior to adopting final rules to implement the Global Mobile
Personal Communications by Satellite (GMPCS) MOU which was signed by the
United States and over 120 additional parties in February 1997.<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></sup>
In this NPRM, the Commission proposed to certify all GMPCS-related terminal
equipment that complies with the Commission's technical and other requirements
for that service, including requirements governing emission limits. In
addition, the Commission proposed that MSS terminals operating in the 1610-1626.5
MHz band would also have to meet the out-of-band emission limits recommended
for implementation by the year 2005 by NTIA in its petition for rulemaking.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA applauds the Commission for its efforts
in implementing the international GMPCS-MOU which will support the deployment
of GMPCS service in the United States and around world. These GMPCS systems
will provide additional choices for delivery of seamless voice, data, and
broadband services for consumers in all parts of the world. In particular,
NTIA would like to commend the Commission for its decision to adopt rules
governing the out-of-band emissions for MSS terminals essentially in accordance
with NTIA's recommendation. The establishment of such rules strikes a reasonable
balance between the public interest in fostering improvement in aeronautical
radionavigation and providing GMPCS development. NTIA, however, offers
the following comments to specific issues raised in the GMPCS NPRM that
NTIA believes will likely have a direct and significant impact upon the
future needs and operations of the Federal aeronautical radionavigation

<p><a NAME="II."></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">II. THE COMMISSION
SHOULD MODIFY ITS RULES TO REFLECT THE AMENDMENT TO THE SPS SIGNAL SPECIFICATION.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commission describes the two GPS signals
centered on a 1575.42 MHz (L1) carrier frequency: a C/A code signal primarily
for civilian use and a 20 MHz wide Precision code signal for military and
authorized civilian use.<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a></sup> Currently,
Section 25.213(b) of the Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R. &sect; 25.213(b),
provides that the bandwidth for the C/A code signal is 2.046 MHz wide extending
from 1574.397 to 1576.443 MHz. This is consistent with the C/A code signal
bandwidth definition in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition of the GPS Standard
Positioning Service (SPS) Signal Specification that serves as the definitive
reference source which delineates the GPS service provided to the civil
community. Recently, however, the bandwidth definition of the GPS C/A code
signal at 1575.42 MHz in the SPS Signal Specification was amended as follows:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The L-band SPS ranging signal is a 2.046
MHz null-to-null bandwidth</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">signal centered on L1. The transmitted
ranging signal that comprises</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">the GPS-SPS is not limited to the null-to-null
signal and extends through</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">the band 1563.42 to 1587.42 MHz.<sup><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This amendment will be reflected in the
upcoming 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition of the GPS SPS Signal Specification due
for release later this year.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The SPS Signal Specification was amended
in recognition that civil GPS receivers utilize the entire transmitted
bandwidth of the C/A code signal to minimize tracking errors due to noise,
interference, and multipath. The power dispersed over the bandwidth of
a GPS signal is extremely important for high accuracy civilian safety-of-life
applications for two reasons. First, the achievable tracking accuracy (in
terms of ranging variance) of a signal is inversely proportional to the
root-mean-square (RMS) signal bandwidth. The implication is that the further
the signal power is dispersed from the carrier frequency, the more important
it is in reducing nominal tracking errors. Second, the most effective multipath
mitigation techniques for GPS rely on having a very sharp cross-correlation
(between the incoming C/A code signal and the receiver replica) function.
Sharpness of the cross-correlation function is provided by having a very
wide bandwidth to capture the signal power well beyond the first lobe of
the signal.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Since it is anticipated that many of the
civilian applications that demand a higher degree of accuracy, including
safety-of-life applications, will use the full transmitted bandwidth of
the GPS C/A code signal, NTIA requests that the Commission conform Section
25.213(b) of its Rules to the amended SPS Signal Specification by replacing
the current frequency range of 1574.397-1576.443 MHz with the new frequency
range of 1563.42 - 1587.42 MHz.</font>
<p><a NAME="III."></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">III. GNSS RECEIVERS
REQUIRE PROTECTION THROUGHOUT THE 1559-1605 MHz BAND.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commission requested comment on the
assumptions underlying NTIA's recommendation to apply the -70 dBW/MHz limit
in the 1597-1605 MHz band to protect aircraft reception of GLONASS signals.<sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)</a></sup>
The United States is making international commitments within the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)<sup><a href="#N_14_">(14)</a></sup>
and the International Maritime Organization (IMO)<sup><a href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup>
to participate in the development of GNSS. This entails providing protection
to different elements of the GNSS, which include both GPS and GLONASS.
The Russian Federation is implementing a three stage frequency transition
plan for GLONASS.<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup> After the year 2005,
the GLONASS system will be in its final configuration where its highest
carrier frequency will be 1604.25 MHz.<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup>
In the international frequency coordination process, the United States
has committed to providing protection from interference to GLONASS in its
final configuration. This protection from interference is to be consistent
with standards established within the International Telecommunications
Union-Radiocommunications Sector (ITU-R).<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">User acceptance of the GNSS would be severely
harmed if GLONASS availability was restricted by interference. It is therefore
necessary that GLONASS receive the same protection from harmful interference
that is afforded to GPS. RTCA Special Committee 159 (SC-159) determined
that the out-of-band emission limits required to protect GPS would also
be appropriate for GLONASS because:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">1) GPS and GLONASS operate in the same
frequency band with nearly identical hardware realizations.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">2) GPS and GLONASS are both pseudo-random
noise (PRN) modulated spread spectrum systems.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">3) GPS is a code-division multiplex system
with all satellites transmitting on the same frequency. GLONASS is a frequency
division multiplex system with each satellite in view transmitting the
same maximal length PRN code on a specific channel frequency. Neither method
has any particular performance advantage over the other in principle.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">4) The standard signal power received is
similar (-160 dBW for GPS and -161 dBW for GLONASS) and both systems have
the same data rate (50 Hz).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">5) The code chipping rate for GPS is twice
that of GLONASS (1.023 MHz for GPS and 0.511 MHz for GLONASS), and thus,
GPS has a 3 dB higher theoretical spreading factor. The lower spreading
factor for GLONASS is offset for wideband noise interference by its 3 dB
narrower effective bandwidth.<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The net result is that the receiver susceptibility
mask for GLONASS will be one-half the frequency scale of the GPS mask,
but the broadband susceptibility will be the same on a per Hertz basis.
Therefore, RTCA concluded that GLONASS requires the same level of interference
protection as GPS.<sup><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to GPS and GLONASS, another
radionavigation satellite service (RNSS) system that could be a component
of the next generation of the GNSS has recently been Advanced Published
with the ITU-R by the European Space Agency (ESA) for operation in the
1587.69-1609.17 MHz portion of the band. For this new RNSS system to be
compatible with GPS and GLONASS, it must have a signal level at the surface
Earth that is on the same order of magnitude as GPS and GLONASS, and therefore
will require the same level of protection from interference. Given that
the interference protection level is the same then the out-of-band emission
limits required to protect the receivers using this new RNSS system would
be the same.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, NTIA's recommendation that a wideband
limit of -70 dBW/MHz and a narrowband limit of -80 dBW should be adopted
to protect aircraft reception of RNSS signals in the 1597-1605 MHz portion
of the band.</font>
<p><a NAME="IV."></a><font face="Times New Roman"><b>IV. INTERFERENCE SUSCEPTIBILITY
LEVELS REQUIRED TO PROTECT GNSS RECEIVERS CANNOT BE REDUCED</b>.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commission requested comment concerning
measures that might be employed to minimize the interference susceptibility
limit of GNSS receivers used in the susceptibility analysis in Appendix
F of the RTCA/DO-235 report.<sup><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></sup> The analysis
in Appendix F only considered the interference susceptibility of a GNSS
receiver and its ability to meet Category I accuracy and continuity requirements
and did not address the more stringent requirements of Category II/III
precision approach landings. It also emphasizes that the aviation community
has accepted the burden of making GNSS receivers more robust so that these
receivers can tolerate the current out-of-band emission limits and still
meet Category II/III approach specifications.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The interference susceptibility levels
of GNSS receivers used in the Appendix F susceptibility analysis represent
the interference levels to which manufacturers must design to meet navigation
performance requirements. It does not represent the allowable level of
interference. For GNSS receivers the critical performance parameter is
the carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N<sub>o</sub>). The C/N<sub>o</sub>
determines the performance of the GNSS receiver code and carrier tracking
loops and directly impacts phase measurement accuracy, carrier cycle slip
rate, navigation message bit/word error rate, and code tracking loop pseudorange
accuracy. The GNSS receiver susceptibility level used in the Appendix F
analysis results in only a 2.5 dB C/N<sub>o</sub> margin, which is much
smaller than the margins established for other ICAO approved navigation
systems.<sup><a href="#N_22_">(22)</a></sup> Moreover, unlike terrestrial
radionavigation systems, the received GNSS satellite power is relatively
fixed (<i>e.g.</i>, cannot increase power to overcome interference), thus
the receivers operate over a smaller dynamic range.<sup><a href="#N_23_">(23)</a></sup>
Given the limited dynamic range and small C/N<sub>o</sub> margin any reduction
in the interference susceptibility levels used to determine the out-of-band
emission levels required to protect GNSS receivers is not possible.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the development of the out-of-band emission
limit for Category I operations, the Minimum Separation Distance (MSD)
between the MSS terminal and the GNSS receiver based on the RTCA SC-159
"source-path-receiver" model was 100 feet.<sup><a href="#N_24_">(24)</a></sup>
For Category II/III operations the performance requirements (<i>e.g.</i>,
accuracy, continuity, integrity) are substantially increased and the MSD
is reduced to 50 feet. Since freespace propagation loss is proportional
to the square of the separation distance, this implies 6 dB higher interference
levels that GNSS receiver manufacturers must tolerate to satisfy Category
II/III specifications. RTCA SC-159 concluded that this 6 dB of additional
tolerance to interference will be difficult to obtain solely by improving
the receiver design.<sup><a href="#N_25_">(25)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The interference susceptibility levels
developed in Appendix F are based on the assumption that there is a negligible
probability that a second transmitter will be operating in close proximity
to a GNSS receiver. As new systems are deployed and transmitters proliferate,
the probability of multiple sources of interference increases. Since the
Appendix F analysis does not consider multiple sources of interference,
an additional margin would be necessary , thereby reducing the allowable
level of interference.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The use of interference suppression techniques
to mitigate interference was also addressed in Appendix F. For the near
future, the civil aviation and GNSS receiver manufacturing industries have
rejected employing certain new, higher-risk interference mitigation techniques
such as adaptive null-steering antennas and the vector tracking loop. These
techniques have not been shown to have acceptable integrity and safety
performance for civil aviation purposes. There is also a prohibitive cost
associated with the implementation of these interference suppression techniques.<sup><a href="#N_26_">(26)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA believes that based on the existing
limited C/N<sub>o</sub> margin, the higher interference levels associated
with Category II/III operations, and the potential of multiple sources
of interference, the susceptibility levels for GNSS receivers cannot be
reduced from the levels assumed in Appendix F that were used to develop
the out-of-band emission limits for the MSS terminals. Furthermore, NTIA
does not believe that interference suppression techniques should be used
as a substitute for GNSS receiver protection limits.</font>

<p><a NAME="V."></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">V. NARROWBAND OUT-OF-BAND
EMISSION LIMITS SHOULD BE SPECIFIED IN TERMS OF ABSOLUTE POWER LEVEL.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commission is proposing to adopt an
absolute power level of -80 dBW for the narrowband out-of-band emission
limit to protect GNSS receivers instead of the spectral power density of
-80 dBW/700 Hz recommended in the NTIA Petition.<sup><a href="#N_27_">(27)</a></sup>
The 700 Hz bandwidth was established in Appendix G of DO-235 as the breakpoint
between narrowband and wideband interfering signals. NTIA agrees with the
Commission's current proposal because it is appropriate to specify narrowband
emissions (<i>i.e.</i>, spurs) in terms of an absolute power level. Moreover,
the narrowband out-of-band emission limit of -80 dBW is consistent with
the value recommended by RTCA SC-159.</font>

SHOULD ADOPT THE OUT-OF-BAND EMISSION LIMITS IN THE 1605-1610 MHz BAND

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commission seeks comment on NTIA's
recommendation to resolve potential interference problems between MSS terminals
and GNSS receivers operating above 1605 MHz on a case-by-case basis.<sup><a href="#N_28_">(28)</a></sup>
Since the NTIA Petition was filed, the ITU-R has developed and approved
Recommendation M.1343 and the European Testing and Standards Institute
(ETSI) developed TBR-041.<sup><a href="#N_29_">(29)</a></sup> Both of these
international documents establish out-of-band emission limits in the 1559-1610
MHz bands for MSS terminals in the 1610-1626.5 MHz band and specifically
require suppression of the out-of-band emission from these MSS terminals
to be linearly interpolated from -70 dBW/MHz at 1605 MHz to a level of
-10 dBW/MHz at 1610 MHz. NTIA believes that it is beneficial to MSS operators
and GNSS receiver manufacturers to establish out-of-band emission limits
in the 1605-1610 MHz band instead of resolving interference on a case-by-case
basis. Therefore, NTIA recommends that the Commission adopt the out-of-band
emission limits established by the ITU-R and ETSI in the 1605-1610 MHz
band. However, it should be noted that these proposed limits are intended
to protect GLONASS operations in the final frequency configuration (after
2005). At that time, GLONASS should be operating with all operational carrier
frequencies below 1605 MHz. In the interim, harmful interference to aeronautical
radionavigation transmissions on frequencies above 1605 MHz from MSS mobile
earth terminals will be resolved on a case-by-case basis.</font>
<p><a NAME="VII."></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">VII. APPROVAL OF
MSS HARDWARE/SOFTWARE CONFIGURATIONS IS NOT NECESSARY.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The NTIA Petition specified three options
that could be used for MSS terminals that do not meet the -70 dBW/MHz and
-80 dBW limits in the 1580.42-1605 MHz band by January 1, 2005. The MSS
terminal had to be: (1) permanently deactivated; (2) modified in such a
way that it would meet the wideband and narrow band limits in the 1559-1605
MHz band; or (3) constrained to operate only on frequencies in the upper
end of the operating band, such that the wideband and narrowband limits
were met in the 1559-1605 MHz band. The hardware/software implementation
to restrict the operation of the MSS terminal had to be determined by the
FAA as meeting air traffic control requirements. The FCC, with the concurrence
of NTIA and the FAA, would incorporate the approved hardware/software implementation
in the appropriate MSS licenses by January 1, 2002. If a negative finding
was made, the licensing of the hardware/software will be denied by the
FCC.<sup><a href="#N_30_">(30)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA agrees with the Commission that design
decisions should be left to the MSS system providers and that requiring
prior approval of hardware/software configurations could be unduly intrusive.
Option 3 was included in NTIA's petition at the request of the geostationary
MSS applicants with operations in the 1626.5-1660.5 MHz band. NTIA does
not believe that Option 3 is necessary if the Commission adopts rules that
will require all MSS terminals operating in the 1610-1660.5 MHz band to
meet the wideband limit of -70 dBW/MHz and narrowband limit of&nbsp; -80

<p><a NAME="VIII."></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">VIII. MEASUREMENT
TECHNIQUES FOR DEMONSTRATING COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES SHOULD BE ADOPTED
TO PROTECT SYSTEMS NEEDED TO AUGMENT GPS FOR AVIATION USES.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The FAA has initiated plans to transition
from its present ground-based navigation and landing system to a satellite-based
system. However, GPS alone will not meet all aviation positioning requirements.
To meet the National Airspace System (NAS) requirements, the FAA has proposed
two augmentations to GPS: a Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) and a
Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS). The WAAS signal will provide the
augmentation to GPS to obtain the required accuracy improvement for precision
approaches, as well as integrity, continuity and availability of navigation
for all phases of flight. A study performed by the Johns Hopkins University
Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) concluded that GPS must be augmented
to satisfy navigation performance requirements and that the WAAS and the
LAAS can provide the required navigation performance.<sup><a href="#N_31_">(31)</a></sup>
The JHU/APL study also considered interference to GPS and its augmentation
systems and recommended that regulations be developed for all licensed
transmitters that explicitly limit radio frequency emissions at satellite
radionavigation frequencies.<sup><a href="#N_32_">(32)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As stated in the NTIA Petition, the out-of-band
emission power levels are the average values to be measured over a 20 millsecond
(msec) time interval. The 20 msec time interval is related to the 50 symbols/sec
data rate of the GPS/GLONASS navigation message with a corresponding symbol
duration of 20 msec (1/50). However, the WAAS transmitted data stream has
a data rate of 500 symbols/second with a corresponding symbol duration
of 2 msec (1/500).<sup><a href="#N_33_">(33)</a></sup> As a result of the
shorter symbol duration, WAAS receivers are more vulnerable to disruption
by long duration pulsed signals. The longer duration pulses will overlap
more of the shorter duration WAAS symbols resulting in an increase in bit
error rate (BER) and the corresponding word error rate (WER) in the data
demodulation performed in GPS and WAAS (GNSS) receivers. Annex A examines
the BER and WER performance of GPS and WAAS receivers. As shown in Annex
A, a WAAS receiver is more susceptible to increases in BER and WER than
a GPS receiver.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The baseline data rate for WAAS is 250
bits/second. The data will be &frac12; rate convolutional encoded with
a Forward Error Correction (FEC) code. Therefore, the symbol rate that
the receiver must process is 500 symbols/second. The convolutional coding
for WAAS will be constraint length 7 as standard for Viterbi coding. WAAS
employs the convolutional code to partially make up for the degradation
in bit energy due to its faster data rate as compared to GPS. Pulses that
are longer than 2 msec will cause symbol erasures in the Viterbi decoder.<sup><a href="#N_34_">(34)</a></sup>
An erasure is a position in the demodulated sequence where the symbol value
is unknown, thereby increasing the BER. The effects on the convolutional
decoding will depend upon the nature of the pulsed signal (<i>e.g.</i>,
random, periodic, or other).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The MSS terminals operating in the 1610-1660.5
MHz band employ Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Code Division
Multiple Access (CDMA) or Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) multiple
access techniques. For MSS terminals employing FDMA or CDMA, the level
of out-of-band emission are constant and the 20 msec measurement interval
is adequate. However, for MSS terminals employing TDMA the out-of-band
emission levels will be related to the duration of the transmission time
slot.<sup><a href="#N_35_">(35)</a></sup> In order to provide protection
to WAAS receivers, NTIA proposes that the out-of-band emissions of MSS
terminals employing either FDMA or CDMA be averaged over a 20 msec time
interval. For MSS terminals employing TDMA the out-of-band emissions should
be averaged over a time interval of duration that is equal in length to
the transmission time slot. This would only apply to future MSS systems
employing TDMA. For existing MSS systems employing TDMA the 20 msec averaging
time interval can be used.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Motorola recommends that the Commission
allow licensees to use spectrum analyzer resolution bandwidths smaller
than 1 MHz and integrate the measurements when testing for compliance with
the wideband out-of-band power-density limits.<sup><a href="#N_36_">(36)</a></sup>
NTIA believes that the method of using smaller bandwidths to measure the
wideband limits is consistent with ITU-R M.1343. Therefore, NTIA agrees
that measurement of the wideband out-of-band emission levels in bandwidths
of less than 1 MHz (<i>e.g.</i>, 30 kHz, 100 kHz, or 300 kHz) is allowable
provided the power of the narrow bandwidth is integrated over 1 MHz.</font>
<p><a NAME="IX."></a><font face="Times New Roman"><b>IX. THE OUT-OF-BAND
EMISSION LIMITS ESTABLISHED TO PROTECT GNSS RECEIVERS SHOULD ALSO APPLY
TO LITTLE LEO MOBILE TERMINALS</b>.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commission states that the frequency
separation between the Little LEO 148-150.05 MHz band and the 1559-1610
MHz RNSS band is sufficient to ensure protection of GNSS receivers.<sup><a href="#N_37_">(37)</a></sup>
Furthermore, the Commission maintains that Little LEO terminals that operate
in compliance with Section 25.202(f) of the Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R.
&sect; 25.202(f), will not produce emissions, including harmonics, in the
1559-1610 MHz band that exceed the wideband and narrowband out-of-band
emission limits established to protect GNSS receivers.<sup><a href="#N_38_">(38)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA disagrees with the Commission's assertion
that frequency separation alone is enough to ensure protection of GNSS
receivers from the unwanted emissions of Little LEO terminals. The Volpe
National Transportation System Landing Systems Laboratory has performed
tests to measure the unwanted emission levels that appear in the 1559-1610
MHz band from very high frequency (VHF) transceivers operating in the 118-136
MHz band.<sup><a href="#N_39_">(39)</a></sup> Even though a frequency separation
of over 1000 MHz exists the test results show that transmitter harmonics,
transmitter spurious (non-harmonic frequency) emissions, and local oscillator
harmonics were found to be at levels that could potentially interfere with
GPS receivers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is important to recognize that the issue
at hand is not the frequency separation that exists between the Little
LEO terminals and the GNSS receivers, but the level of the interfering
signal in the passband of a GNSS receiver, as well as the potential for
close proximity to an aircraft in final approach. If the interfering signal
exceeds the GNSS receiver susceptibility threshold, the location in frequency
of the fundamental is irrelevant since it will still cause interference.
Annex B examines the out-of-band emission levels of representative Little
LEO terminals assuming they are in compliance with Section 25.202(f) of
the Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R. &sect; 25.202(f). As shown in Annex B,
the levels in Section 25.202(f) are 32 dB higher than required to protect
GNSS receivers for wideband emissions and 37 dB for narrowband emissions.
In practice it may well be that these levels of unwanted emissions will
generally be present in well designed Little LEO terminals.<sup><a href="#N_40_">(40)</a></sup>
However, NTIA disagrees with the Commission's conclusion that Little LEO
terminals operating in compliance with Section 25.202(f) will necessarily
produce emissions in the 1559-1610 MHz band that are not in excess of the
proposed wideband and narrowband limits.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commission also proposes to exempt
Little LEO systems from the out-of-band emissions standards rather than
require the licensees to incur the expense of establishing compliance with
unnecessary restrictions.<sup><a href="#N_41_">(41)</a></sup> It is unclear
whether the Commission is proposing to exempt the Little LEO terminals
from the out-of-band emission limits in Section 25.202(f) of its Rules,
47 C.F.R. &sect; 25.202(f), or those proposed in the NTIA Petition. In
any case licensees must make measurements to demonstrate compliance with
the out-of-band emission limits adopted for the Little LEO terminals. In
order to measure the out-of-band emissions to the limits proposed by NTIA
in the 1559-1610 MHz band, the only additional test equipment that would
be required is a suitable filter and low noise amplifier. Therefore, NTIA
does not believe that measuring emissions in the 1559-1610 MHz band would
present a significant expense to Little LEO licensees.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA recognizes that a balance must be
established between the development of emerging technologies and the protection
of sensitive Government operations. The potential interference to GNSS
receivers from little LEO MSS terminals touches upon the much broader issue
of the protection of important Government operations (<i>e.g.</i>, satellite
navigation, search and rescue) from the unwanted emissions of emerging
mobile systems. If the unwanted emission levels are too restrictive this
could inhibit the development of emerging mobile technologies. On the other
hand, if the unwanted emission levels are too high, sensitive Government
operations, and likely many commercial services as well, will not be adequately
protected as the use of the radio spectrum increases.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The protection of the spectrum used by
GPS will be discussed in a report from the Secretary of Defense to the
congressional defense committees.<sup><a href="#N_42_">(42)</a></sup> The

and Transportation, the director of the Office of Science and Technology
Policy, and interested user and industry representatives has been tasked

<p><a NAME="X."></a><b>X. THE COMMISSION SHOULD ADOPT MSS TERMINAL CARRIER-OFF
EMISSION LIMITS.</b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Both ETSI and the ITU-R recognize that
MSS terminals operating in the 1610-1626.5 MHz band have two operational
states: carrier-on and carrier-off. In the carrier-on state an MSS terminal
is transmitting a signal in a continuous or non-continuous mode. In the
carrier-off state an MSS terminal is powered-on but not transmitting a
signal. The emission limits proposed in the NTIA Petition only apply to
the situation where an MSS terminal is in the carrier-on state. When an
MSS terminal is in the carrier-off (<i>e.g.</i>, stand-by) state, any emissions
should be held to levels that are lower than those for the carrier-on state.
While this is obvious, a provision still needs to be included in the Commission's
rules, otherwise the probability of more than one MSS terminal being in
a
position to cause interference to an aircraft in a final approach landing
could become unacceptably large. NTIA recommends a limit for carrier-off
that is 10 dB lower than the carrier-on limit to account for a cumulative
power effect. The cumulative power effect is attributed to the significant
majority of MSS mobile earth terminals in the carrier-off state.</font>

of GLONASS proves slower than expected.<sup><a href="#N_44_">(44)</a></sup>
As stated earlier, the NTIA Petition proposes a time-phased approach for
GLONASS protection that considered: (1) MSS terminals commissioned prior
to January 1, 2002; (2) MSS terminals commissioned after January 1, 2002;
and (3) MSS terminals in operation after January 1, 2005.<sup><a href="#N_45_">(45)</a></sup>
The time-phased approach was proposed by NTIA as a way to ensure protection
of GNSS operations, while allowing MSS providers to proceed with system
implementation.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the NTIA Petition was filed, there
have been several key developments regarding GNSS that have occurred in
the 1559-1610 MHz band. In addition to GPS, GLONASS, and their augmentation
systems, there are other RNSS systems proposed for operation in this band.<sup><a href="#N_46_">(46)</a></sup>
For example, the French Administration and ESA have advanced published
RNSS systems with the ITU-R that are planned for operation in the 1559-1610
MHz band. The French Medium SATellite NAVagation (MSATNAV) and the ESA
E-NSS-1 satellite navigation systems have been proposed for operation in
the 1559.052-1563 MHz and 1587.696-1591.788 MHz portions of the 1559-1610
MHz band.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The United States is also engaged in discussions
with the European Union (EU) regarding implementation of the second generation
GNSS (GNSS-2) and the development of RNSS systems that are compatible and
interoperable with GPS. Subsequently, the EU has proposed the Galileo RNSS
system.<sup><a href="#N_47_">(47)</a></sup> At this time, it is unknown
what portion of the 1559-1610 MHz band it will operate in. One option being
considered is to build Galileo from the base of the existing GLONASS system
which would enable the EU to take advantage of Russia's expertise in space
operations and lead to an early deployment of a European GNSS-2 satellite
system.<sup><a href="#N_48_">(48)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is envisioned that one of these RNSS
systems will be included in the GNSS-2. Since all of the RNSS systems operating
or proposed for operation in the 1559-1610 MHz band are being designed
to be compatible with each other they have similar characteristics which
include a low signal level at the surface of the Earth (<i>e.g.</i>, 1
x10<sup>-16</sup> Watts). This is why the out-of-band emission limits proposed
in the NTIA Petition were developed. As a result of the continuing evolution
of the 1559-1610 MHz band NTIA believes that it is ill-advised to waive
or postpone the 2002 compliance date for new MSS terminals proposed in
the NTIA Petition. However, NTIA does agree that there is some uncertainty
for the date of the domestic implementation of GLONASS. The status of GLONASS
implementation should be reviewed in the 2005 timeframe and the date for
invoking the final stages of compliance can be adjusted accordingly.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="XII."></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">XII. INTERIM EMISSION
LIMITS IN NTIA PETITION SHOULD NOT APPLY TO GEOSTATIONARY MSS TERMINALS.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commission invites comment on whether
the interim wideband limit of -64 dBW/MHz (in the 1580.42-1605 MHz band)
and the narrowband limit of -74 dBW (in the 1585.42-1605 MHz band) proposed
in the NTIA Petition should also apply to geostationary MSS terminals operating
in the 1626.5-1660.5 MHz band.<sup><a href="#N_49_">(49)</a></sup> NTIA
does not believe that it would be appropriate to apply the interim standards
to such geostationary MSS terminals.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">When the NTIA Petition was filed, there
were no MSS terminals operating in the 1610-1626.5 MHz band; thus, there
was an opportunity for such terminals to be designed to meet the interim
limits prior to being placed into service. On the other hand, there are
a large number of geostationary MSS terminals already in operation that
could exceed the proposed out-of-band emissions levels. In recognition
of this fact, NTIA proposes that geostationary MSS terminals currently
in service or brought into service prior to January 1, 2002, be permitted
to operate at their current out-of-band emission levels in the 1597-1605
MHz portion of the band until January 1, 2005. Geostationary MSS terminals
operating in the 1626.5-1660.5 MHz band that are brought into service after
January 1, 2002, however, should be required to comply with the final emission
levels of -70 dBW/MHz and -80 dBW. NTIA believes that this two-fold approach
will both protect current equipment investments and lessen the burden on
manufacturers by allowing them adequate time to redesign their terminals
to comply with the final emission limits.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="XIII."></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">XIII. POSITION LOCATION
CAPABILITIES SHOULD BE REQUIRED FOR GMPCS TERMINALS AUTHORIZED IN THE UNITED
STATES.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commission seeks comment on whether
to require GMPCS terminals authorized for use in the United States to have
position location capabilities.<sup><a href="#N_50_">(50)</a></sup> NTIA
notes that the Commission has acted to require wireless carriers to deliver
911 and to meet a schedule for introducing the features of Enhanced 911
(E 911) calls from wireless devices such as cellular and personal communication
services (PCS), whose networks are terrestrially based.<sup><a href="#N_51_">(51)</a></sup>
Effective April 1, 1998, wireless carriers are required to implement Phase
I of this schedule, provided certain conditions were met.<sup><a href="#N_52_">(52)</a></sup>
Under Phase I rules, carriers must provide Automatic Number Identification
(ANI) and cell site information for 911 calls to Public Safety Answering
Points (PSAP).<sup><a href="#N_53_">(53)</a></sup> Phase II, which requires
the deployment of the capability to determine the location of callers,
by latitude and longitude, is scheduled for October 1, 2001.<sup><a href="#N_54_">(54)</a></sup>
NTIA believes that a user in need of emergency assistance should receive
help independent of which type of wireless device that person is using.
This should be independent of whether the network is terrestrially based
like cellular or PCS or satellite-based like GMPCS. Since the ability to
locate users in distress is in the public's best interest, NTIA supports
position location capabilities for GMPCS terminals authorized for use in
the United States.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The United States Coast Guard (USCG) has
stated that MSS systems should be included in the requirements for wireless
providers to provide compatibility with E 911 emergency calling systems.
It is envisioned that GMPCS terminals could be used by persons in distress
in remote maritime areas. To provide effective search and rescue support
it is essential that the USCG know the location of individuals in distress
and be able to confirm the existence of a distress situation. In order
to do this, the USCG must be able to immediately determine ANI and Automatic
Location Identification (ALI) information. The ALI information is necessary
to ensure that the call is routed to the proper response agency. Many of
the MSS systems currently operating or planned for operation in the near
future are capable of providing position accuracy within 125 meters as
required in Phase II of the Commission's E911 Order.<sup><a href="#N_55_">(55)</a></sup>
For example, GPS contained in the MSS handset will provide a horizontal
accuracy of 100 meters with selective availability activated.<sup><a href="#N_56_">(56)</a></sup></font>
<p><a NAME="XIV."></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">XIV. THE COMMSSION
SHOULD CLARIFY WHICH EARTH TERMINALS WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THE PROPOSED
CERTIFICATION PROCESS.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commission appears to propose that
handheld or portable GMPCS terminals, such as those permanently installed
on ships, boats or planes, not be required to obtain FCC certification
under Part 2 of the Commission's Rules.<sup><a href="#N_57_">(57)</a></sup>
It is unclear, however, whether the Commission seeks comment on this proposal
or if the Commission proposes to exempt such terminals from the out-of-band
emission limits proposed in the NTIA Petition.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">If the Commission's intent is to exempt
handheld or portable GMPCS terminals on ships, boats or planes from the
process of obtaining the certification with the associated eligibility
to use the "GMPCS-MOU ITU REGISTRY" mark, NTIA has no objection. If the
intent, however, is to exempt these terminals from the emission limits
proposed in the NTIA Petition, NTIA strongly disagrees. These terminals
could be located in the vicinity of a GNSS receiver and pose a potential
interference threat. Thus, the emission limits should be a requirement
of all earth terminals.</font>
<p><a NAME="XV."></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">XV. IF THE COMMISSION
ADOPTS A CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENT FOR EARTH TERMINALS, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL
STANDARDS SHOULD BE DEVELOPED FOR SEMI-FIXED AND FIXED GMPCS SATELLITE
EARTH TERMINALS.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commission also requests comment on
whether the certification process should encompass all varieties of earth
terminals, including such fixed services as Very Small Aperture Terminals
(VSATs).<sup><a href="#N_58_">(58)</a></sup> This proposal would expand
the types of satellite terminals considered under the GMPCS-MoU to include
semi-fixed (transportable) and fixed (village pay phones) and to include
such terminals operating in the fixed-satellite service. In general, NTIA
has no objection to such a certification process, but notes that it could
require the development of national and international standards and recommendations
for the essential technical parameters of semi-fixed and fixed GMPCS earth
terminals similar to those adopted for the MSS earth terminals. In addition,
operation of these terminals within the U.S. must be in accordance with
the national allocation table.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="XVI."></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">XVI. SPECIFIC EMISSION
LIMITS TO PROTECT MARITIME GPS RECEIVERS MAY BE DEVELOPED.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commission states that the purpose
of this proceeding is to adopt out-of-band emission limits for protection
of only aeronautical uses of RNSS.<sup><a href="#N_59_">(59)</a></sup>
As noted earlier, however, the International Maritime Organization (IMO)
has also recognized GPS and GLONASS as elements of their GNSS.<sup><a href="#N_60_">(60)</a></sup>
There are currently numerous mariners operating in-land and coastal waterways,
including recreational and commercial vessels, who depend upon GPS for
navigation and safety. In many instances these mariners operate their vessels
with GPS receivers interconnected to automatic pilots. Both the U.S. Coast
Guard (USCG) and the IMO are considering mandating that vessels required
to carry radios must also carry Automatic Identification System (AIS) equipment,
ship-to-ship transponders incorporating GPS receivers to aid navigation
in restricted waterways and areas of heavy traffic. GMPCS compliant terminals
used by operators and passengers on these vessels could cause interference
to GPS receivers if adequate out-of-band emission limits are not adopted.
The USCG currently supports the limits proposed by the Commission in the
GMPCS NPRM. However, the USCG is considering developing interference susceptibility
standards for maritime GPS receivers within the Radio Technical Commission
for Maritime Services (RTCM). The results of the work performed by USCG
may have to be considered in a future rulemaking on uses of RNSS other
than aeronautical.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="XVII."></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">XVII. RADIO ASTRONOMY
OBSERVATIONS MUST BE PROTECTED AGAINST EMISSIONS FROM MSS TERMINALS.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The 1610-1613.8 MHz band is shared on a
co-primary basis with the radio astronomy service. Radio astronomy operations
are protected from MSS earth terminal emissions in Part of the Commission's
Rules.<sup><a href="#N_61_">(61)</a></sup> The National Science Foundation
(NSF) requests that these rules be explicitly referenced in a Report and
Order so that they are easily accessed by foreign MSS operators who may
not be familiar with the Commission's Rules.<sup><a href="#N_62_">(62)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The band 1660-1660.5 MHz was allocated
to the generic mobile-satellite service at WRC-97, on the condition that
it not cause interference to radio astronomy stations operating in this
band. There is a concern that the out-of-band emissions from MSS earth
terminals operating below 1660 MHz may interfere with radio astronomy observations
conducted in the 1660-1670 MHz radio astronomy band. At this time the issue
has not been adequately studied. Based on further studies, and experience
with MSS earth terminals below 1660 MHz, it may be necessary to revisit
this issue, in order to protect radio astronomy operations in the 1660-1670
MHz band, and request a tightening of the out-of-band emission standards
or to introduce other measures.<sup><a href="#N_63_">(63)</a></sup> XVIII.
CONCLUSION</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">NTIA urges the Commission to consider carefully
the issues raised in these comments in an effort to develop a workable
arrangement that would greatly facilitate global roaming of MSS terminals
while protecting sensitive Government operations.</font>
