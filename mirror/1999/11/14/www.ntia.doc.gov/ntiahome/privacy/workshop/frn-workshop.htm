<p><b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</b>
<p><b>Authority: </b>15 U.S.C. 41 <i>et seq.</i>; 47 U.S.C. 902(b)(2)(H);
47 U.S.C. 902(b)(2)(M).
<p><b>1. Background</b>
<p>In July 1998, Vice President Gore asked the Department of Commerce to
work with the Federal Trade Commission to encourage companies that build
dossiers (profiles) about individuals by integrating information from a
variety of database sources to implement effective self-regulatory mechanisms.
The Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission have been working
together to explore ways in which consumer privacy can be protected in
light of the rise of new technologies that facilitate "online profiling,"
the practice of aggregating information about consumers' preferences and
interests, gathered primarily by tracking their movements online, and using
the resulting consumer profiles to create targeted advertising on Web sites.
Profiling typically employs "cookies," text files placed on users' computers
to store information about their computers and their online activities.
Companies are involved in a wide array of activities that support online
profiling. For example, some companies develop profiling software and license
it to Web sites that wish to track their own visitors; others manage networks
of sites, pool data about consumers who visit sites in those networks,
and sell or place online advertising based upon inferences about consumers
drawn from the pooled data; still others specialize in measuring the popularity
of particular online advertisements for advertisers. Privacy concerns have
been raised by many of these practices. Consumers are largely unaware of
the creation of online profiles, and the implementation of core fair information
practices of notice, choice, access and security with respect to the collection
of information in online profiles remains a significant challenge. The
Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission are announcing
a public workshop to be held on November 8, 1999, to inform government
officials and the public about these and related issues, and about industry's
current self-regulatory efforts to develop privacy protections for online
consumers.
<p><b>2. Workshop Agenda</b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The workshop will be held on </font>November
8, 1999 at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Main Auditorium, 1401 Constitution
Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230.<font face="Times New Roman"> The tentative
schedule for the workshop is as follows: the workshop will begin at 8:30
a.m. and will consist of three sessions, which will run consecutively.</font>
<p><b>Session I:</b> <b><i>Online Profiling Technology.</i></b> This session
will explore information technologies that facilitate profiling of consumers
online, both technologies that are currently in use and those in development.
This session will focus particularly on the extent to which these technologies
permit the integration of information that identifies consumers as individuals
with non-identifying information.
<p><b>Session II: <i>Implications of Online Profiling Technology for User
Privacy. </i></b>This session will examine the extent to which online profiling
technologies impinge upon consumer privacy, as well as the costs and benefits
of online profiling for both consumers and businesses.
<p><b>Session III: <i>The Role of Self Regulation. </i></b>This session
will examine the potential of self-regulation as a means of addressing
the privacy concerns raised by online profiling. This session will also
examine ways in which profiling technology can be deployed to promote adherence
to fair information practices. Current efforts to implement fair information
practices in the profiling industry will be discussed.
<p><b>3. Participation in Workshop Sessions</b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Those parties who wish to participate as
panelists in the workshop must notify the Secretary of the Federal Trade
Commission, in writing, of their interest in participating in Sessions
I, II, and/or III on or before October 18, 1999. Parties may participate
in more than one workshop session; requests to participate must specify
the session(s) in which participation is sought. All workshop sessions
are open to the public.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Staff of the Department of Commerce and
the Federal Trade Commission will select a limited number of panelists
to participate in the Workshop Sessions. In order to promote a thorough
examination of the issues and to facilitate an effective discussion, participants
will be chosen to represent different points of view and interests. Parties
requesting to participate are therefore encouraged to file written comments.
The agencies may invite parties to participate as panelists who have not
filed requests to participate.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Parties will participate in an open discussion
of the issues. It is contemplated that the selected panelists will ask
and answer questions based on their respective comments, including questions
posed by staff of the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission,
at the workshop. The discussion will be transcribed and the transcription
placed on the public record.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">To the extent possible, staff of the Department
of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission will select panelists to represent
the following affected interests, as well as any other interests that staff
may identify and deem appropriate for representation. For Session I: online
profiling companies; Web site operators; online advertisers; experts in
profiling technology and software. For Session II: consumer and privacy
advocacy groups; industry groups; Internet service providers; Web site
operators; online marketers; Internet "portal" sites; consumers who are
active on the World Wide Web. For Session III: online profiling companies;
Web site operators; online advertisers; Internet "portal" sites; industry
groups; consumer and privacy advocacy groups</font>. Each session may also
include members of the academic or research community with expertise in
privacy, fair information practices, and/or consumer preferences with respect
to the use of personal information in the online environment.
<p>Parties to represent the above-referenced interests will be selected
on the basis of the following criteria:
<p>1. The party's participation would promote a balance of interests being
represented at the workshop.
<p>2. The party has expertise in or knowledge of the issues that are the
focus of the workshop.
<p>3. The party adequately reflects the views of the affected interest(s)
which it purports to represent, not simply a single entity or firm within
that interest.
<p>4. The party has been designated by one or more interested parties (who
timely file written comments and requests to participate) as a party who
shares group interests with the designator(s).
<p>5. The number of parties selected will not be so large as to inhibit
effective discussion among them.
<p>If it is necessary to limit the number of panelists, those not selected
to participate may be afforded an opportunity at the end of the workshop
to present their views during a limited time period. The time allotted
for these statements will be determined on the basis of the time necessary
for discussion of the issues by the selected parties, as well as by the
number of persons who wish to make statements.
<p><b>4. Invitation to Comment</b>
<p>Interested parties are requested to submit written comments on any issue
of fact, law, or policy that may inform the U. S. Department of Commerce
and the Federal Trade Commission's study of online profiling. Specifically,
comment is requested on the questions set forth below. These questions
are designed to assist the public, however, and should not be construed
as a limitation on the issues on which public comment may be submitted.
