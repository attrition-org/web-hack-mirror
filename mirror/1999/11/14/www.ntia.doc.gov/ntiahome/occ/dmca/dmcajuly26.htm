<p>ACTION: Request for Public Comment
<p>SUMMARY: The National Telecommunications and Information<font face="Times New Roman">
Administration of the United States Department of Commerce and the United
States Copyright Office invite interested parties to submit comments on
the effects of Section 1201(g) of Title 17, United States Code, as adopted
in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Pub. L. No. 105-304, 112 Stat.
2860 (Oct. 28,1998) ("DMCA") on encryption research and the development
of encryption technology; the adequacy and effectiveness of technological
measures designed to protect copyrighted works; and the protection of copyright
owners against unauthorized access to their encrypted copyrighted works.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">COMMENTS:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">1. I believe this proposed code addition
needs wider public exposure for consideration.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Why didn't we didn't use this same approach
to low observable (stealth) technology, we could have saved a fortune.
The United States could have simply painted all of it's aircraft yellow.
We would have negotiated a treaty with the world and ordered our citizens
to abide to the same agreement, not to notice yellow airplanes. Then if(when)
someone shot down one of our yellow airplanes it would not only be considered
an act of war, but we could fine them too. Don't forget to outlaw the Blueblocker
type sunglasses.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">3. There are already legal protections
for copyrighted work. Let encryption methods stand on their own merits
and they will progress as the need and market does.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Got to love how that technologically
poor excuse for protection we now have makes the movies I rent flicker,
oh please let me pay more for any new equipment that can do worse.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I find this slow intensity modulation so
annoying that without the availability of signal boosting amplifiers that
were sometimes considered illegal, these "original" videos would have been
unwatchable and certainly less enjoyable. If you legislate junk I won't
purchase it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">5. I wonder if this idea is from the same
folks who raised our taxes and usage fees by</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">$ 9,000,000,000 while describing it as
" revenue enhancing spectrum auctions " ?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Sir and Madam:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Thank you for the opportunity to comment
on the effects on encryption research of the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I am presently employed in the field of
cryptography. I design and implement cryptographic algorithms for the software
libraries used by my employer, Network Associates, Inc. NAI is one of the
largest companies providing cryptographic software in the United States,
particularly the well known encryption program, PGP.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Encryption is a crucially important technology
as we enter the 21<sup>st</sup> century. As we move into a world of electronic
communications, cryptography is becoming the primary tool for controlling
the flow and dissemination of information. It is necessary that research
in this area continue unfettered so that we know what is possible and,
more importantly, where we are failing to achieve our goals.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It appears that the DMCA may have a very
unfortunate chilling effect on cryptographic research. The act has a number
of provisions which specify under what circumstances cryptographic research
may occur which relates to investigating the strength of copyright protections.
The problem is that these are written in an ambiguous style which will
put researchers at risk of violating the law. Prudent researchers who do
not want to risk criminal prosecution will avoid work in this area.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The result will be that the only people
working on breaking copyright protection will be criminals. Legitimate
users will have no way of knowing whether the technology to which they
are entrusting their secrets is working properly or not. That's the problem
which researcher Bruce Schneier points out with regard to encryption: bad
cryptography looks much the same as good cryptography. Only with expert
analysis and challenge can we determine whether our algorithms are breakable.
By driving the legitimate experts into other avenues of research, the DMCA
will leave the field to those who care nothing about laws. To paraphrase
another slogan, if you outlaw cryptographic research, only outlaws will
do cryptographic research.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us look at the specific provisions
of the DMCA which lead to this unfortunate result.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">``(g) Encryption Research.--</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">``(1) Definitions.--For purposes of this
subsection--</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">``(A) the term `encryption research' means</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">activities necessary to identify and analyze
flaws and</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">vulnerabilities of encryption technologies
applied to</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">copyrighted works, if these activities
are conducted to</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">advance the state of knowledge in the field
of</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">encryption technology or to assist in the
development of</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">encryption products; and</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">``(B) the term `encryption technology'
means the</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">scrambling and descrambling of information
using</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">mathematical formulas or algorithms.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Here we see a problem which is symptomatic
of this section of the Act.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We have an attempt to specifically define
what encryption research is, so that it may be exempted. However the definition,
although wordy, is far from clear. It relies on determining the purpose
of the activities which are undertaken: are they intended to advance the
state of knowledge, and/or to assist in developing encryption products.
But it will be very difficult to prove what the purposes are of any particular
instance of defeating copyright protection. A criminal may claim that he
intended to disseminate his results, or a legitimate researcher who delays
publication while he gathers more data may find himself accused of criminal
actions.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">``(2) Permissible acts of encryption research.--</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
(a)(1)(A), it is</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">not a violation of that subsection for
a person to circumvent a</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">technological measure as applied to a copy,
phonorecord,</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">performance, or display of a published
work in the course of an</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">act of good faith encryption research if--</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">``(A) the person lawfully obtained the
encrypted</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">copy, phonorecord, performance, or display
of the</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">published work;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">``(B) such act is necessary to conduct
such</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">encryption research;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">``(C) the person made a good faith effort
to obtain</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">authorization before the circumvention;
and</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">``(D) such act does not constitute infringement</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">under this title or a violation of applicable
law other</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">than this section, including section 1030
of title 18</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">and those provisions of title 18 amended
by the Computer</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">These provisions will impose a considerable
burden on the researcher.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(A) requires him to retain documentation
on all copyrighted material which he has in his possession in order to
show that he obtained it lawfully. But this may not be at all reasonable,
for if the material is encrypted it may be widely available for download.
There is no technology available to prove that a given piece of data was
freely available at some time in the past. This provision is going to be
intolderably burdensome in many cases.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(B) has the problems listed above in interpreting
what constitutes encryption research.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Provision (C) can only be described as
bizarre. There is no requirement elsewhere in the exemptions to receive
authorization from the copyright holder. Apparently, whether authorization
is granted or not makes no difference, but nevertheless the researcher
is required to seek authorization? This is completely illogical.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, this provision will face many
of the same documentation problems as section (A), as in many cases the
copyright holder may not be known or reachable. What constitutes a good
faith effort in that case? The researcher who fails to guess correctly
on this point faces criminal prosecution.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(D) can only increase the uncertainty felt
by a researcher considering entering this minefield.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The net result is that these provisions
carve out an exception which is loaded with traps, where inadequate documentation
can lead to criminal penalties, and where illogical actions are required
for no purpose. This is sure to drive many qualified researchers from the
field.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">``(3) Factors in determining exemption.--In
determining</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">whether a person qualifies for the exemption
under paragraph</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(2), the factors to be considered shall
include--</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">``(A) whether the information derived from
the</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">encryption research was disseminated, and
if so, whether</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">it was disseminated in a manner reasonably
calculated to</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">advance the state of knowledge or development
of</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">encryption technology, versus whether it
was</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">disseminated in a manner that facilitates
infringement</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">under this title or a violation of applicable
law other</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">than this section, including a violation
of privacy or</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">breach of security;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">``(B) whether the person is engaged in
a legitimate</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">course of study, is employed, or is appropriately</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">trained or experienced, in the field of
encryption</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">technology; and</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">``(C) whether the person provides the copyright</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">owner of the work to which the technological
measure is</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">applied with notice of the findings and
documentation of</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">the research, and the time when such notice
is provided.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">These provisions further increase the uncertainty
and risks which will be faced by researchers. Not only his intentions are
being judged, but the judgement criteria are left vague and menacing.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Under provision (A) he has to disseminate
his results in an acceptable way. What does that mean? If he notifies his
colleagues, which is a common practice in the research community, is he
now open to prosecution? If some colleagues use the information irresponsibly,
is the original researcher to be penalized? He faces a dilemma whether
he publishes or keeps his results secret.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As for provision (B), are we now creating
a de-facto classification of "licensed cryptographers" who are allowed
to do cryptographic research? Imposing criminal penalties based on whether
a judge views the researcher as having adequate training, experience, and
employment is absurd without some kind of objective certification. This
is a fast-moving field and many of the most creative results have come
from individuals without formal training in cryptography (which is offered
at very few institutions). I personally have nospecific training in the
field other than a degree in computer science. Would this pass muster under
this provision? There is no way to know.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Provision (C) is astonishingly vague. It
seems to be trying to hint that a break should initially be reported only
to the copyright holder, then later to the research community, and finally
it can be made public. But for some reason the Act is not willing to say
so plainly.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This provision is representative of the
flaws in this entire section of the Act. It is legislation by innuendo,
enforcement by intimidation. These requirements are not stated clearly,
rather we have an ill defined set of guidelines which may be interpreted
in any way desired by the judge. It is impossible to conduct research safely
in such a regime.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In summary, the attempts by the DMCA to
carve out an exception for legitimate cryptography researchers are seriously
flawed. Anyone doing research in this area faces severe record-keeping
burdens, and risks having their actions misconstrued. With criminal penalties
as the result of anything determined to be a violation, it is likely that
this Act will drive cryptographic researchers from the field.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The result will be a loss of confidence
in cryptographic technology as users realize that the best and brightest
researchers are no longer able to do research in this field. This will
harm electronic commerce and damage American interests domestically and
internationally. As currently written, it appears that the DMCA will have
exactly the opposite effect from what was intended, in that it will reduce
the protections to copyright holders and delay widespread electronic distribution
of copyrighted material.</font>

<p><a NAME="James Ray"></a>>The principal question is: "How will the provisions
of section 1201(g)
<p>>of the DMCA affect encryption research?"
<p>...
<br>And I am not going to address that question, as I think that the 9<sup>th</sup>
Amendment to the US Constitution precludes your regulations on encryption
research regardless of whether or not lawyers want to dishonestly ignore
it, along with judges, law professors, justices...
<p>It's there, period. Wanna try and repeal it? Go ahead, but enough of
the dishonest pretending it doesn't exist!
<p>I will instead focus on the _actual_ meaning of the term "Escrow."
<p>Escrow REQUIRES a NEUTRAL, THIRD PARTY, no matter what Newspeak spewing
NSA lawyers might claim. If you want to have GAK (Government Access to
Keys) then swallow the cowardice of the bureaucratic past and SAY that
you want Government Access to Keys. Try honesty. The US government is rarely,
if ever, able to make a convincing case that y'all are neutral (much less
third) parties, especially in cases you'd want to assert it (probably more
drug asset forfeiture than terrorism, since government agents are greedy,
and don't want to get their asses shot off or blown up).
<p>So, the bottom line is: go get a dictionary, look up the *TRUE* meaning
of the term, and begin using it honestly for a change. I say "for a change"
because of the bipartisan dishonesty that has spanned more than a decade
of government criminality &amp; moral turpitude. Honesty may cause you
to "lose" on the issue of grabbing everyone's privacy, but that's because
government DESERVES to lose, and freedom _deserves_ to win. This will lead
to LESS, not more, violence in the future.
<p>Thanks for listening. If you think I am wrong about ANYTHING I've written
above, please tell me why.

<p><b><font face="Arial">Section 1201(g) of the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial">National Telecommunications and Information Administration</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial">July 26, 1999</font></b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The Software &amp; Information Industry Association (SIIA) is the principal
trade association of the software and information industry and represents
over 1,400 high-tech companies that develop and market software and electronic
content for business, education, consumers, the Internet, and entertainment.
SIIA members represent a wide range of business interests. In particular,
numerous SIIA members create and develop new and valuable encryption technologies,
use encryption technologies to protect their proprietary content, and purchase
or license software and information products and other content and services
that utilize encryption technologies. Consequently, SIIA and many of our
members are extremely interested in issues relating to the protection and
use of encryption technologies and the relationship between research and
development activities relating to encryption and the provisions in the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) prohibiting the circumvention of
technological protection measures such as encryption.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In response to the "Request for Comments on Section 1201(g) of the Digital
Millenium Copyright Act" published in the <u>Federal</u> <u>Register</u>
of May 27, 1999 by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA) and the Copyright Office, SIIA files the following comments on behalf
of its members.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The notion of trust in electronic commerce is of critical importance
and applies to both consumers and businesses. From securing sales to the
handling of personal data to certifying transactions and individuals, trust
is the underlying issue that will determine whether electronic commerce
reaches its full potential. That trust must be instilled first in intellectual
property owners. If these rights holders are expected to make their proprietary
content available over the Internet, one must recognize the risks associated
with placing their property in an environment where it could be stolen,
and an infinite number of exact copies can be distributed worldwide. Therefore,
if electronic commerce is going to thrive, rights holders must be able
to trust that their proprietary digital content will be safe and secure
in the network environment. In the long run, this trust will benefit consumers,
who will have more products to choose from, and the added convenience and
flexibility of access through electronic licensing.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>One way a sense of trust can be established in the e-commerce environment
is through the use of technological protection measures. SIIA firmly believes
that through the deployment of market-developed technological measures,
many of the concerns of both the copyright owner and user communities can
be most effectively addressed.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Perhaps the most promising technological protection measure is encryption
technology. Encryption technology allows the users of such technologies
to control access to their proprietary materials. While encryption technology--like
any other technological solution--will prevent a certain amount of piracy,
it is not 100% effective. Because piracy tools that circumvent and disable
encryption technologies and other technological measures are widely available,
mere use of technological protection measures is not a complete solution.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Another significant part of the solution is the enactment of appropriate
legal protections that encourage rights holders to make their proprietary
materials accessible online and adequately punishes those who run afoul
of these protections. To restore the balance upset by piracy tools, the
legal protections afforded to rights holders must provide effective legal
remedies against unauthorized circumvention of technical protection measures.
More significantly, legal protections must also prohibit the trafficking
in tools that permit such circumvention. With passage of the DMCA last
October copyright owners now have (or, in the case of the conduct prohibitions,
will have) these remedies at their disposal in the United States.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Section 1201(a) of the DMCA prohibits both the act of circumventing
technological protection measures to gain unauthorized access to copyrighted
works and the trafficking in any anticircumvention tools that permit unauthorized
access. The prohibition against trafficking, which became effective immediately
upon enactment of the DMCA, applies to those technologies, products, services,
devices, or components that: (1) are primarily designed or produced for
circumvention purposes, (2) have only limited commercially significant
purpose or use other than to circumvent, or (3) are marketed with the knowledge
that they will be used for circumvention purposes.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The prohibition against the act of circumvention prohibits such acts
as the use of a bootleg password or "crackz" application to gain unauthorized
access to a pirate copy of computer software. Unlike the prohibition against
trafficking in anticircumvention tools, however, the prohibition against
acts of circumvention will not become effective until October 28, 2000.
Nevertheless, the combined force of the availability of encryption technologies
and the prohibitions in the DMCA that protect against acts of circumvention
and trafficking in circumvention tools, likely will reduce fears of rampant
downstream piracy sufficiently to encourage rights holders to make their
works available to others online.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The anticircumvention prohibitions are not without their limitations.
Notably, section 1201(g) of the DMCA provides an exception to the prohibitions
against circumvention of technological protection measures contained in
Section 1201(a) of the DMCA. This exception permits a person to circumvent
encryption implemented as a technological measure to a published work in
the course of good faith encryption research when certain conditions are
met.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Section 1201(g)(5) of the DMCA requires the Register of Copyrights and
the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department
of Commerce to jointly report to Congress on the impact that subsection
1201(g) of the DMCA has had on encryption research by no later than October
28, 1999. In particular, the DMCA requires that this report inform Congress
on the effect that section 1201(g) has had on: (1) encryption research
and the development of encryption technology; (2) the adequacy and effectiveness
of technological measures designed to protect copyrighted works; and (3)
protection of copyright owners against the unauthorized access to their
encrypted copyrighted works.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>To date, section 1201(g) has had no discernable effect on encryption
research, the development of encryption technology, the adequacy and effectiveness
of technological measures designed to protect copyrighted works, or the
protection of copyright owners against the unauthorized access to their
encrypted copyrighted works. Only nine months have passed since the anticircumvention
trafficking prohibitions in Section 1201(a)(2) of the DMCA became effective.
While technology progresses and digital distribution practices change at
an extraordinary rapid pace in the digital age, we have seen no change
in the market for encryption technologies or the products and services
that use such technologies during this time that would warrant a change
to section 1201(g).
<br>&nbsp;
<p>SIIA believes that the exceptions in section 1201(g) are narrowly crafted
and well balanced. The statutory language contained in the good faith encryption
research exception was arrived only after extensive negotiation, debate,
and consultations between the interested parties and various officials
in the executive and legislative branches of the government. We therefore
advise against any alteration of section 1201(g), as doing so would upset
the delicate balance the parties were able to achieve last year.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Further, as noted above, the prohibitions against conduct in section
1201(a)(1) have not yet gone into effect. This is particularly significant
given that the exception in section 1201(g)(2) applies only to the conduct
prohibitions in section 1201(a)(1). Because the conduct prohibition has
not gone into effect, the exceptions in 1201(g)(2) have been of no consequence.
Therefore, the exceptions in section 1201(g)(2) have had no impact whatsoever
on encryption research and development or the use of technological measures.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Unlike the encryption research exception contained in section 1201(g)(2),
the encryption exception contained in section 1201(g)(4), which applies
to the prohibition against trafficking in circumvention tools, has been
in effect the past nine months. As stated earlier, we also have seen no
evidence that this exception has had any impact on any of the three factors
that the Copyright Office and NTIA are required to report to Congress.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>For the aforementioned reasons, SIIA and its members believe that section
1201(g) should not be altered. We are aware of no evidence that section
1201(g) of the DMCA has impacted encryption research or the development
of encryption technology. Nor does there appear to be any evidence that
section 1201(g) has any impact on the adequacy and effectiveness of technological
measures designed to protect copyrighted works or the protection of copyright
owners against the unauthorized access to their encrypted copyrighted works.

<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman">Re: Section 1201 (g) of the Digital
Millenium Copyright Act</font></u></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(Docket No. 990428110-9110-01)</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Ms. Bruening and Mr. Feder,</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I am grateful for the opportunity of submitting
comments on behalf of Time Warner Inc. in response to the request for comments
announced in the Federal Register Volume 64 No. 102.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Time Warner Inc is, as you know, one of
the leading companies engaged in the production and distribution of copyrighted
works including motion pictures and phonorecords. As such, it is vitally
interested in adequate and effective protection of copyrights. In that
connection, Time Warner devotes significant resources to fighting unauthorized
uses of its copyrighted works in the United States and abroad.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Time Warner employs encryption technology
in order to protect its audiovisual products from unauthorized uses and
devotes significant resources to the development and implementation of
protective technologies for its audio and audiovisual works. The Request
for Comments seeks information with respect to, <i>inter alia</i>, the
effects of Section 1201 (g) of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act on "protection
of copyright owners against unauthorized access to their encrypted copyrighted
works."</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Section 1201 (g) which is headed "Permissible
Acts of Encryption Research" provides that it is not a violation of Section
1201 (a) (1) (A) (which prohibits circumvention of technological measures
that control access to protected works) for a person to circumvent a technological
measure "in the course of an act of good faith encryption research" if
certain criteria are met.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Among the criteria are (i) that such act
is necessary to conduct such encryption research (Section 1201 (g) (2)
(B)) and (ii) the researcher made a good faith effort to obtain authorization
before the circumvention (Section 1201 (g) (2) (C)).</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">These provisions have the laudable purpose
of supporting research into encryption and thus encouraging discovery of
weaknesses in encryption systems that would render them ineffective as
protectors of copyright. There are, however, threats to copyright protection
that are apparent on the face of the provisions in question.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is far too early (less than nine months
after passage of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act) to have accumulated
any hard evidence of the impact of Section 1201 (g) on protection of copyrights.
Nevertheless, there has been sufficient history both prior to and since
passage of the Act to warrant expressing a few cautions and some suggestions
in connection therewith about the serious impact on copyright owners of
misuse of "research" that could be encouraged by Section 1201 (g).</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Where a copyright protection technology
has been overcome, i.e. the encryption code broken, the "research" that
led to that was not done by the iconic individual in his/her garage but,
rather, by groups of persons having access to large computers in business
or academic locations. Such research, more often than not, was not at the
request or with the authorization of the owner of the encryption system
or an authorized user thereof, and the motives for undertaking such "research"
varied from scientific to pernicious.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Whatever the motives, because the "research"
is not conducted by an isolated individual, word quickly gets around about
how to break a particular encryption system.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">When so-called "pirate smart cards" or
similar devices are marketed, the advertising for them typically includes
a disclaimer "for research only" - with much the same veracity as radar
detectors for automobiles are advertised as "not intended to encourage
speeding."</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">What is needed in order to protect against
"research" that has these damaging results are measures to assure that
those who do the research are doing so for legitimate reasons and meet
the criteria set forth in Section 1201 (g) (2) (A) -(D). Some factors to
be used in determining whether a person qualifies for the exemption are
set forth in Section 1201 (g) (3) but there are a few serious weaknesses
in the regime so established which should be dealt with by an amendment
or clarified by regulation.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps the most important requirement
as a basis for exemption is that the person doing the research do so with
actual written authorization of the owner of the encryption system. There
is no reason to suppose that owners of encryption systems would be unwilling
to authorize legitimate researchers to test for weaknesses in the encryption
systems. Leaving the criterion, however, at merely making "a good faith
effort to obtain authorization" (Section 1201 (a) (2) (C)) could allow
for illy motivated "researchers" to meet this qualification by sending
off (or even claiming to send off) a letter, a fax or an e-mail which does
not reach its destination. On the other side of this coin, such a requirement
would impose on the owner of the encryption system a burden of attending
to its mail, fax and e-mail communications with more speed than it may
be able to muster.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Secondly, in this same context, the statute
does not tell us what happens if a researcher does make "a good faith effort
to obtain authorization" and the owner of the technology turns down the
request. As suggested above, many of these problems could be resolved if
actual written authorization were required.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Among the safeguards that would flow from
a requirement for actual written authorization is the possibility that
the owner of the technology might require, as a condition of granting authorization,
that the researcher agree not to disclose any facts about the technology
or about the results of the research. In the absence of such a non-disclosure
agreement, the ability to break an encryption system becomes, as suggested
above, widely known. Such a non-disclosure provision should be considered
a reasonable condition of a grant of authorization.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Thank you for your consideration of these
comments. My colleagues and I at Time Warner Inc. would be happy to meet
with you to discuss these issues at your convenience.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Re: Request for Comments on Section 1201(g)
of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act<u>, Docket No. 990428110-9110-01</u></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Ms. Bruening &amp; Mr. Feder:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As professionals working in data security
and encryption, we wish to comment on the "expert exception" of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. In general, we believe that the DMCA together
with the "expert exception" will be very detrimental to the general interests
of the American public, individuals and businesses alike. Specifically,
as an integral part of the DMCA, we feel the "expert exception" will not
provide assistance in combating illegal copying and other breaks, but instead
will act as a shield for inappropriate and bad security and actually promote
undesired exploits.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The expert exception allows for professionals,
academics, and licensees with consent of the content owners to analyze
the cryptography of the products or technology. Others are restricted from
doing so, except under a small set of conditions. Further, the dissemination
of any information regarding weaknesses of a system is restricted to the
same group of interested parties. While well intended, there are troubling
aspects to this: Without broadening this exception, the likely consequence
will be a weakening of the overall strength and quality of the products
that are brought to market. The licensees of technology will be less certain
of the consequence of using that technology and put at far more jeopardy
than before the act with the "exception" were made into law. The reliance
on consent as a requirement for licensees to examine technology is unreliable
and inappropriate when considered for cryptographic examination and testing.
These points are examined immediately below.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">First, regarding who can challenge. It
is in everyone's interest to examine cryptographic and security systems
as widely as possible. Any problems with a system will be found eventually.
It is simple, better sooner than later. It is simply necessary to provide
a wide opportunity of analysis to the whole community of computer professionals,
content providers, prospective licensees and others just to gain satisfaction
about the relative protection of systems used by users. After all, the
protection of all parties involved is what is at stake here. Cryptography
used in a system should be thoroughly examined for the same reason cars
go through crashing tests, with results available to the consumers. Cryptography
is no longer a research topic, it is rather a technology used in a wide
variety of commercial systems. The overall protection that a licensee can
expect from a vendor cannot be evaluated always from a single work or even
a selected body of works that they have access to. Instead, the strength
of the cryptography and security will be from the entire body of materials
and technology suites that use the technology. Giving the right to challenge
to a small number of testers on a selected amount of material may not provide
enough exposure to all the potential problems to provide confidence to
any of the parties.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The security industry as a whole condemns
"security through obscurity" as ineffective. Obscurity in a system is ultimately
analyzed and the problems with it seen. What was obscure, if important
becomes widely analyzed and quite open. The security of a system is as
good as the number of qualified and interested people who have examined
the system. The crux of the matter is "against whom are you protecting?"
Bad guys will examine it no matter what. You just can't stop it. It is
far better to all the interested parties to allow everyone to look at cryptography
right off the bat. The real protection of intellectual property comes from
the copyright law, rather than from the encryption that prevents its easy
copying; the quality of the encryption must stand on its own regardless
of who is trying to break it. Real security is built on technology that
works, regardless of who knows about it. Content owners must understand
level of security that technology provides. All content providers simply
cannot employ enough security professionals to analyze and attack copyright
encryption schemes (especially small ones!). It is impossible for them
to examine all the potential uses of systems and applications that might
expose any problems. There must be a recognition that the open analysis
and sharing of information in the broad commercial and academic communities
is necessary to protect all parties interests in matters related to copyrighted
material.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a saying in the industry, "no
security is better than weak security". Weak security has a number of bad
consequences. It provides essentially no protection, it introduces cost
for consumer and producer, and it hides problems. With the new act and
the restrictions of the "exception", this latter problem becomes enormous.
In fact, claiming to have security without doing the required due diligence
can be easily positioned as "deception" from the consumer standpoint and
could be litigated as knowingly marketing and selling products without
doing the best to ensure proper functionality. Providing any statement
to consumers regarding the functionality of the product is not valid without
proper examination, publicly.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The exception attempts to restrict the
actual testing to parties that have connections to the technology in question.
Besides professionals and academics, these are direct licensees of the
technology, and then only if they have the consent of the relevant copyright
holder. This is simply not the way technology is tested and evaluated these
days for licensing or adoption. Especially in the case of communications
systems, openness is crucial. A vendor's choice of encryption technology
actually affects the entire industry. The failure of even one vendor to
establish and choose the appropriate encryption technology can have wide
spread effects on the entire industry. It is no longer the case that commercial
interests are served directly by academic pursuits. A viable technology
needs to be tested and serviced by the actual community of users. This
restriction is just setting up for an enormous failure.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a false belief that "cryptography"
lives in a vacuum. Like many parts of technology, cryptography is utilized
as a component in increasingly complex systems. Encryption is now a basic
component of many operating systems, hardware platforms, and application
software. It is not only the security expert but also computer system engineers
and quality engineers who need to certify and examine the technology. As
such, testing the entire system must include certain tests of the correctness
and robustness of the encryption subsystem. With this exception as written,
such tests may actually be in violation of the proposed law. This merging
of unencrypted and encrypted data is probably going to be the most significant
change to the nature of systems over the next few years. The discipline
of maintaining an environment that can actually be trusted is a requirement
for the U.S. industry to lead as it has.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The question even arises as to who this
exception will actually benefit. It seems obvious that most interested
parties benefit more from a wider body of testers than the exception allows.
Potential licensees of a technology need to know whether they can trust
the security of the system or not. It is a huge undertaking to decide on
and implement a technological solution. If they can't submit it to arbitrary
tests, they can't make an intelligent decision. Take a silly case, where
all data of a product is encrypted with a minimal key, say 1 byte. But
the producer may represent it as secure. According to this act, anyone
who intentionally tested the security if not for research or directly established
commercial interested would be in violation. But, any attacker would go
after the key and it would happen rapidly using available cryptanalysis
tools. The protection in that environment is afforded to the attackers
rather than the content producers or the licensees of the technology. The
licensee and original technology providers are both losers. Consumers lose
when technology is unavailable or flawed. Only competitors or hackers seem
to be victorious.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In conclusion, though there is no question
that the issue of copyright protection is a serious one that needs significant
legislative attention, the "expert exception" hurts the overall effort
of development and protection of intellectual property. As computer security
and cryptography specialists we encourage a much more open and realistic
approach to the problem. Ultimately, the protection of any data will depend
on the overall strength of the cryptography and systems that implement
the security. This should be acknowledge with an "exception" that encourages
as much testing and overall cooperative development of technology as possible.
Weak cryptography will always be broken. It is better to focus on the illegal
use of content and corresponding enforcement rather than to limit activities
that promote cryptography and technology that actually work.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">COMMENTS OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF
COMPOSERS, AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS ON SECTION 1201(g) OF THE DIGITAL MILLENIUM
COPYRIGHT ACT</font></b>
<p>The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ("ASCAP")
hereby submits these comments in response to the Notice of the Copyright
Office and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration
of the United States Department of Commerce ("NTIA") of May 25, 1999, 64
Fed. Reg. 28802 (May, 27, 1999). The Notice of the Copyright Office and
the NTIA was given pursuant to 17 U.S.C. &sect;1201(g)(5), as adopted in
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), Pub. L. No. 105-304, 112
Stat. 2860 (Oct. 28, 1998). That section directed the Register of Copyrights
and the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department
of Commerce to prepare a report for the Congress examining the impact of
section 1201(g) on: (a) encryption research and the development of encryption
technology; (b) the adequacy and effectiveness of technological measures
designed to protect copyrighted works; and (c) protection of copyright
owners against the unauthorized access to their encrypted works. The Notice
is intended to solicit comments from interested parties that will be considered
in the preparation of that report.
<p><b><u>ASCAP's Interest in this Proceeding</u>.</b>
<p>ASCAP is the oldest and largest musical performing rights society in
the United States with a repertory of millions of copyrighted works and
more than 85,000 songwriter and publisher members. ASCAP is also affiliated
with over 60<b><i> </i></b>foreign performing rights organization around
the world and licenses the repertories of those organizations in the United
States.
<p>ASCAP members, as owners of copyrighted musical works, enjoy exclusive
rights in those works as are granted under section 106 of the Copyright
Act. These rights include the right to perform the works publicly, the
right to produce the works in copies and the right to distribute such copies.
On behalf of its members and affiliated foreign performing rights societies,
ASCAP licenses only their non-dramatic public performance rights.
<p>The types of users to whom ASCAP grants public performance licenses
are wide and varying, and include, for example, television and radio broadcasters,
hotels, nightclubs and college and universities. As new means of technology
have been created to transmit music, ASCAP has sought to offer new forms
of licenses appropriate to these mediums.<b> </b>Thus, as transmission
of copyrighted musical works became possible over the Internet,<b> </b>ASCAP
became the first performing rights organization to license these transmissions.
<p>More recently, and of relevance to this proceeding, ASCAP has been exploring
on behalf of its members, watermarking technology and other means of "digitally
marking" a copyrighted work so that the public performance of a work so
marked if digitally transmitted can be tracked and the owner of such work
properly compensated for the work's performance. Clearly if means of "hacking"
or circumventing this watermark were to be used, it would undermine the
copyright owner's rights.
<p>As the Copyright Office is aware, ASCAP has sought to represent its
members' concerns over the impact of digital transmission on their rights
as copyright owners in the recent studies being conducted by the Copyright
Office, at the direction of Congress.<b> </b>Indeed, ASCAP participated
in the Copyright Office's recent studies on the matter of notice to libraries
and archives of normal commercial exploitation or availability at a reasonable
price, <u>see</u> 63 Fed. Reg. 71785 (Dec 30, 1998) (Copyright Office Notice
for Comments), and in the study of the promotion of distance education
through digital technologies. <u>See</u> 63 Fed. Reg. 63749 (Nov. 16, 1998)
(Copyright Office Notice for Request of Information). With regard to the
study on distance education, ASCAP's contributions to the Copyright Office's
study were acknowledged in the Office's report. That study culminated in
recommendations given to Congress which supported an "updating" of copyright
law to permit the use of digital technologies to provide distant education,
while still taking into account the need to employ appropriate technologies
to secure copyright owners' rights. <u>See</u> Report on Copyright and
Digital Distance Education at www.loc.gov/copyright/disted.
<p>As the technological landscape is radically changing, copyright owners
have been struggling to take advantage of the new possibilities technological
advancements offer, while still protecting against unauthorized and unlicensed
uses. For example, in its comments to the Copyright Office with regard
to digital distance education, ASCAP strongly recommended that any legislation
with regard to the digital delivery of distance education include guidelines
that safeguard against abuses; and, specifically recommended that such
guidelines include technological safeguards to protect against the unauthorized
use of ASCAP's members' copyrighted works.
<p>ASCAP has always heralded the advancement of technology. Such advancement
acts to encourage and advance<b><i> </i></b>our members' creative process
and output. Nevertheless, at the same time, ASCAP strives to ensure that
its members are duly compensated for the use of that creative output. It
is for this reason ASCAP supported the enactment of section 1201(g) in
the DMCA, which specifically prohibits the act of circumventing technological
measures that effectively control access to a copyrighted work protected
under the Copyright Act and the manufacture, import, offering or trafficking
in any technology or product which is primarily designed or produced to
circumvent a technological measure that controls access to a copyrighted
work.
<p>Nonetheless<b>,</b> ASCAP understands that in order to properly safeguard
against unauthorized uses of its members' copyrighted works, constant research
and development of effective protective measures is necessary. Accordingly,
ASCAP appreciates that the exception created by<b> </b>section 1201(g)
is intended to permit<b> </b>good faith encryption research, defined by
section 1201(g)(1)(B) as the "activities necessary to identify and analyze
flaws and vulnerabilities of encryption technologies applied to copyrighted
works, if these activities are conducted to advance the state of knowledge
in the field of encryption technology or to assist in the development of
encryption products." However, as with any legislative exception, certain
limits and guidelines must be set.
<p><b><u>Issues of Concern to ASCAP</u></b>
<p>ASCAP supports the limitations already set forth in section 1201(g)(2)
and guidelines set forth in section 1201(g)(3). The limitations of section
1201(g)(2) require the researcher to have obtained the copyrighted work
lawfully and to have made a good faith effort to obtain authorization from
the works' owner prior to circumvention, and requires that the circumvention
be "necessary to conduct such encryption research." The factors in determining
whether the research fits underthe exemption under section 1201(g)(3) include:
(a) the dissemination of the information derived from the encryption research;
(b) the person performing the circumvention; and (c) whether the copyright
owner is given notice of the findings of the research.
<p>However, ASCAP is concerned that in order for this exemption to serve
its intended purpose, the following three factors must be more carefully
considered and delineated so it is clear: (1) who may perform the research;
(2) what the permitted purposes for the research are; and (3) what may
be done with the research once performed. By focusing on these factors,
the limits to the exemption can and<b> </b>should be structured such that
it permits only research that is truly<b> </b>directed at studying the
flaws and vulnerabilities of encryption technology <i>for the benefit and
protection of the copyright owner.</i>
<p>(1)<i>Who May Perform the Research?</i>An exemption for encryption research
should explore more than whether the person is engaged in a legitimate
course of study and whether the person is experienced in the field of encryption
technology as provided in section 1201(g)(3)(B). Research can be broken
into three groups: (i) academic research; (ii) governmental research; and
(iii) research for private commercial concerns. To the extent that there
are differences between these groups, legislation should take into account
those differences. However, in all cases, the recommendation should explicitly
state that no entity, including federal and state governmental entities,
is immune from application of the U.S. copyright laws and that all entities
must respect the rights of copyright owners. Accordingly, section 1201
should specifically include governmental circumvention within its general
rule and its exceptions, including section 1201(g)(2).
<p>(2)<i>What are the Permitted Purposes of the Research?</i>The definition
of encryption research under the statute specifies that the research must
be done in the pursuit of identifying and analyzing flaws and vulnerabilities
of encryption technology as part of advancing "the state of knowledge in
the field of encryption technology" or to assist in the development of
encryption products. ASCAP is concerned that<b> </b>this definition may
not necessarily protect copyright owners from those who may indeed be advancing
the state of knowledge of encryption, but for less than genuine purposes.
For example, it may be that a student engaged in a legitimate course of
study may be engaged in research of encryption technology - research which
may indeed advance the field - but could be deployed in a manner that would
run counter-active to the interests of protecting copyrighted works.
<p>Presently, notice and documentation are merely <i>factors</i> in determining
the exemption under section (1201(g)(3)(C). The Copyright Office and the
NTIA should propose regulations that spell out how these factors may be
satisfied. For example, the person conducting the research could be required
to give the copyright owner of the work to which the technological measure
is applied notice of the research prior to its performance, a list of those
who will be performing the research and documentation of the research once
the research is completed. Alternatively, instead of satisfying the above
criteria, a researcher would have to comply with certain research guidelines,
such as a requirement that any research which requires pre-approval or
is funded through a grant - public or private - may be subject to set preconditions
that must be strictly enforced and could then guarantee that a legitimate
purpose for the study is being pursued.
<p>ASCAP urges the Copyright Office and NTIA to explore a means of ensuring
the narrow application of this exemption so that it only permits legitimate
encryption research that respects and protects copyright owners' rights.
<p>(3)<i>What May be Done With the Research?</i>An additional factor in
determining whether the 1201(g) exemption applies is whether the information
derived from the research is disseminated, and if so, whether it is disseminated
in a manner reasonably calculated to advance the state of knowledge or
development of encryption technology. As it has been observed, the effectiveness
of encryption technology is contingent on the ability to keep such technology
out of the hands of those who may abuse it. Therefore, ASCAP supports this
factor as a control against infringing use of copyrighted works, but would
recommend promulgation of regulations whereby researchers would be prohibited
from disseminating their research to anyone or entity that may further
deploy that research in a manner that is adverse to copyright owners' interests
and that the burden is on the researcher to inquire of the person or entity
to whom the research is to be disseminated that the information will not
be put to such adverse uses. If not unduly burdensome, researchers should
also be required to provide to the copyright owner or their agent or their
representative organization (such as, a collecting or performing rights
society, a recording or publishing association) upon whose works the encryption
research was performed, a list of all those to the research was disseminated
and a certification that the person to whom the research is being supplied
is not believed to be seeking the information for purposes adverse to copyright
owners' interests. Such requirements would go along way towards preventing
research from being disseminated to those who might abuse the findings
of the research while at the same time it would<b> </b>permit copyright
owners to retain better control over the exploitation of its works. Control
over use is one of the exclusive rights granted under the Copyright Law;
encryption research under this exemption to the extent permitted should
not undermine any of the exclusive rights of copyright owners.
<p><b><u>Conclusion</u></b>
<p>ASCAP, while not directly involved in the research of encryption technology,
is on behalf of its members exploring the uses of such technology and has
a great interest in ensuring that such technology protects the copyrighted
works of its members. ASCAP hopes that the Copyright Office and the NTIA
will take the above issues that ASCAP has pin-pointed into consideration
