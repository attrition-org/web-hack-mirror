<h1><center>A Short History of NTIA</center></h1>

<br><br><br>

<p>

<h4><b><p>NTIA is the President's principal adviser on telecommunications 
and information policy issues and, in this role, frequently works with 
other Executive Branch agencies to develop and present the Administration's 
position on these issues.  In addition, NTIA also manages the Federal use 
of the spectrum.</p>
<p>Over NTIA's history, it had been at the cutting edge of issues.  For example, the NTIA was instrumental
in the development of spectrum auctions, and the use of computers to conduct the bidding electronically.
  Following up on suggestions made by academics, FCC staff members and others, the NTIA
published a notice of inquiry in late 1989 that, among other things, suggested the use of competitve bidding
(auctions) as a more efficient and fair method for the FCC to assign licenses.  In a 1991,
the NTIA called for the use of auctions.  The NTIA advocated this position for two more years,
until President Clinton signed legislation allowing the use of auctions in 1993.
The NTIA thereafter encouraged the use of a computerized electronic bidding system,
something that had never been done before.  NTIA, among other things, worked with experts
 at the California Institute of Technology, to help develop the basics for the type
of system later employed by the FCC.

<li>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) was 
created in 1978 as a result of a major reorganization.  This reorganization 
transferred and combined various functions of the White House's Office of 
Telecommunications Policy (OTP) and the Commerce Department's Office of 
Telecommunications (OT).

<p>
<li>OTP, in existence since 1970, was responsible for, 
among other things, telecommunications policymaking and radio spectrum management 
on behalf of the President.  OT provided staff support for OTP's spectrum 
management and other functions, which included frequency allocation and 
assignment, service as Secretariat to the Interdepartment Radio Advisory 
Committee (IRAC) (in existance since 1922) and a technical research and analysis capability.  

<p>
<li>NTIA's creation was accomplished by Reorganization Plan Number 1 (1977) and
implemented with Executive order 12046 (1978).  The reorganization undertaken 
by these documents abolished OTP and, by transferring most of OTP's functions 
to the Department of Commerce, effectively consolidated OTP with OT.  The 
transferred functions included the President's authority to assign frequencies 
to radio stations belonging to and operated by the United States and authority 
to carry out other radio spectrum management activities, and long-range spectrum 
planning in cooperation with the Federal Communications Commission.  The 
reorganization also transferred certain functions related to the planning 
and development and other aspects of the communications satellite system.  
Importantly, it made the Secretary of Commerce the President's principal adviser 
on telecommunications policy, and transferred functions relating to studies 
in various areas, including telecommunications research and development and the 
presentation of Executive Branch views on matters to the FCC and others, among 
other functions.  These documents also established the position of Assistant 
Secretary for Communications and Information.

<p>
<li>Immediately thereafter, the Commerce Secretary prescribed the scope of authority 
of the Assistant Secretary and created NTIA pursuant to Department Organization 
Order 10-10.  That order delegated to the Assistant Secretary for Communications 
and Information the functions transferred to the Secretary of Commerce by the 
reorganization documents, as well the functions of OT. It also made the Assistant 
Secretary the Administrator of NTIA.  In 1992, the NTIA Organization Act of 1992 
codified NTIA's authority in detail and incorporated this organizational structure 
into statute. 

<p>
<li>NTIA also administers telecommunications grant programs.
The Public Telecommunications Facilities Program, which awards equipment grants to 
public telecommunications entities, was transferred to NTIA from the Department of 
Health, Education, and Welfare in 1978.  In 1990, Congress established in the 
Commerce Department the National Endowment for Children's Educational Television.  
In 1993, Congress established the Telecommunications and 
Information Assistance Program in NTIA.  The Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure
Assistance Program (TIIAP) provides matching grants to non-profit organizations to fund
projects that improve the quality of, and the public's access to, education, health care,
public safety, and other community-based services.
