<h4 align="left"><b>A key element of the Clinton Administration's vision is to  
provide a broad, modern concept of Universal Service and Open Access.   
In the past, Universal Service meant extending public access to "basic services" 
or what is known as "plain old telephone service" (POTS) at reasonable rates 
to the majority of households in the United States.  This is still a major 
Administration and NTIA goal.  Today, with dramatic technological advances and 
structural changes in the telecommunications sector, the traditional concept of
Universal Service is in transition. (<A HREF="http://www.benton.org/Policy/Uniserv/">
See Benton Foundation Universal Service Library</A>) 
<p>The NTIA is creating a modern definition of basic service and looking at the issue of whether basic 
service should include access to the Internet.  The NTIA is also examining service support 
 and whether it should differ among households and key institutions.  
Affordability is also an issue facing the Administration, as well as who should contribute to the funding and who
should benefit from it. </h4>

On July 8, 1999, President Clinton and the NTIA released a third report in a series - 
<A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fttn99/contents.html">
<i>Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide</i></a>.  This report was preceded by 
1995's <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html">

<h3 align="left">Telecommunications Act of 1996 and E-Rate</h3>
<ul>
<li><h4 align ="left">Congress, through the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/telecom.html">
Telecommunications Act of 1996 </A>, has made important strides in
shaping a new vision for Universal Service.  For example, for the first time, 
the Universal Service concept now includes service discounts for eligible
schools, libraries and rural health care providers in what is known as
the E-Rate (Educational Rate).  The NTIA has been very active in 
E-Rate.  Recent letters concerning E-Rate include a <A HREF ="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/press/erate5599.htm">
May 1999 statement </a>
by Sec. of Commerce Daley and the joint letter signed by the Secretaries of
