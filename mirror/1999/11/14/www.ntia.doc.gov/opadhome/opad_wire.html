<h4>NTIA participates in a number of activities that affect
the delivery of wireless radio telecommunications services,
including private sector cellular radio, paging, private
radio and personal communications services.  NTIA also
manages use of spectrum by Federal Government entities, and
is therefore involved in many aspects of Federal wireless
radio services, such as those used in law enforcement,
aviation, and national security.

NTIA's Office of Policy Analysis and Development (OPAD) provides policy 
advice on a wide variety of issues that affect the availability and 
development of wireless communications services. 
<p>
<h4>Competition and Universal Service</h4>
NTIA sees the development of wireless services as important to achieving the goals 
of the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/telecom.html">Telecommunications Act of 1996</a> of local loop 
competition and <A HREF="./opad_us.htm">Universal Service</a>.  The agency has worked with the Congress 
and the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/wtb">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) to ensure that legislation 
and regulations are competitively neutral and do not preclude wireless 
from becoming a viable competitor in local service provision.  In December, 
1997, NTIA/OPAD organized a public forum on <A HREF="../forums/wireless/index.html">Wireless Local Loop</a>, at which 
representatives from business, government and academia met to advance 
understanding of these issues.   NTIA/OPAD has also maintained that wireless 
service could be eligible to receive support from Universal Service and 
E-Rate programs.  The NTIA Administrator Larry Irving has at times spoken on such issues as 
<A HREF="../ntiahome/speeches/amta615.htm">"New Opportunities for Small Wireless Operators"</A>.
<p>
<h4>Spectrum Allocation and Assignment</h4>

In conjunction with NTIA's <A HREF="../osmhome/osmhome.html">Office of Spectrum Management</a>, OPAD  
proposes national spectrum policies for private sector and 
government users.   NTIA's early advocacy of flexibility and competitive 
bidding as spectrum management tools led directly to the 1993 legislation 
that granted the FCC authority to use auctions for licensing.  NTIA's 
support for these modern approaches was developed in a comprehensive 1991 spectrum policy study, 
<A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/osmhome/91specagen/1991.html">"U.S. Spectrum Management Policy:  Agenda for the Future"</a> which still serves as a 
resource for understanding spectrum management issues.  In that study, NTIA 
called for, among other things, greater reliance on market principles in 
spectrum management, including flexibility and competitive bidding 
(<a href="http://www.fcc.gov/wtb/auctions/">auctions</a>).  NTIA's early advocacy of these modern approaches toward 
spectrum management lead directly to the 1993 legislation that granted the 
FCC authority to use auctions for licensing.  NTIA also advocated the use of 
electronic auctions, which the FCC has used with great success.  NTIA/OPAD 
continues to track spectrum management developments and such issues as Third 
Generation mobile wireless services.

<p><h4>Broadband Wireless</h4>
Advanced services such as hish speed Internet and video programmin require
more capacity than many wireless serives can now provide.  The NTIA is 
actively working on policy positions to promote the development of
"broadband" wireless services, including Third Generation (3G) services.  A member of NTIA's
staff recently spoke on the topic of <A HREF="./bbw.html">broadband wireless</a>.

<p>
<h4>Federal Users of Commerical Wireless Services</h4>

On an operational level, NTIA, in its leadership of the <A HREF="http://is2.antd.nist.gov/fwuf/fwpc.html">Federal Wireless 
Policy Committee</a> has advocated greater use of commercially-provided wireless 
services by government agencies to increase the flexibility and mobility of 
federal employees and lessen reliance on government-exclusive networks where 
feasible. As part of that effort, for example, NTIA Administrator Larry 
Irving in 1998 wrote to FCC Chairman William Kennard requesting FCC action 
to establish a wireless <A HREF="../ntiahome/fccfilings/52098wt96_86ltr.htm">priority access</a> system for qualified 
public safety or national security users of commercial mobile services in 
times of emergency.  A member of NTIA's staff presented a <A HREF="./wire_summ.html">summary
of wireless issues</a> at the 
<A HREF="http://is2.antd.nist.gov/fwuf/index.html">Federal Wireless Users' Forum</A> meeting in April 1999.
