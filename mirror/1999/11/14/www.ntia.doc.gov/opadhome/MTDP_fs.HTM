<h4><a href="./mtdpweb/outline.htm">The Minority Telecommunications Development Program (MTDP)</a> was
established in 1978 to develop programs and policies that
increase minority ownership of broadcast and
telecommunications businesses.  The following activities
illustrate the contributions that MTDP makes to the growth and
development of viable minority-owned telecommunications
business in the United States:</h4>

<UL>
<LI>    MTDP provides policy input for the development of
     legislation and regulations which affect minority
     business participation in the telecommunications
     industry.
<P>
<LI>    MTDP provides training for minority broadcasters. 
     In 1990, MTDP implemented a management training
     program called ComTrain, for new minority
     commercial broadcast station owners and
     construction permit recipients.  New owners are
     paired with the general managers of commercial
     stations owned by ComTrain corporate-sponsors,
     where they receive executive training and
     counseling tailored to their specific interests. 
     Through ComTrain, MTDP offers free consultant
     services to trainees once their stations are on the
     air.  ComTrain is funded by the Minority Business
     Development Agency of the U.S. Department of
     Commerce.
<P>
<LI>    MTDP researches and tracks minority ownership in
     broadcasting.  With the support of public and
     private industry groups, MTDP develops minority
     ownership statistics, and a listing of minority-
     owned commercial radio and television stations in
     the U.S., entitled Analysis and Compilation of
     Minority-Owned Commercial Broadcast Stations in the
     United States.  
<P>
<LI>    MTDP distributes a packet of materials, which
     includes a listing of financial and technical
     assistance organizations, sample business plans,
     and other useful information.
<P>
<LI>    MTDP examines trends and business opportunities in
     telecommunications for minority entrepreneurs,
     through brainstorming sessions, conferences and
     other industry networking activities.
