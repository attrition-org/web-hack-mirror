<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">NO HITCHHIKER <BR>FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS  	</H2>
<P>	There will be no <I>Hitchhiker</I> published for November 1 and November
8.  The next issue, <I>HH</I> #1329, will appear on November 15.  Why?  Because
the writer/editor, Robert Upton, wants to leave the country.   		</P>
<P>&quot;Gone Fishing&quot; could have been the headline for this announcement.
 But it would have been untrue.  &quot;Gone Kayaking&quot; would have been more
accurate.  Robert is loosening the newsletter shackles to head for Baja
California and the cockpit of a salt water kayak.  After a close encounter with
the salt sea, he will be willing to sit down at the <I>Hitchhiker</I> terminal
again, recharged and thankful for a dry chair.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">STATE DROPS BAKER &amp; TAYLOR  		</H2>
<P>On September 30, the statewide price agreement that included Baker &amp;
Taylor expired, effectively removing the popular vendor of library materials
from the list of approved state contractors to provide books to New Mexico
government agencies.  This means that Baker &amp; Taylor is not a legal source
of business for state agencies and other governmental entities that must follow
state procurement laws.  		</P>
<P>A number of libraries around the state that regularly do business with Baker
&amp; Taylor, the State Library included, were surprised by this development. 
State Librarian Ben Wakashige and other members of the State Library staff,
acting on the behalf of these libraries, met with agents of General Services
Department, Office of State Purchasing, to discuss the problem.   Contractors
must reapply every year in order to be included on the list of approved vendors.
 For unknown reasons, State Purchasing did not receive a contract from Baker &amp;
Taylor, automatically disqualifying the vendor as a legal contractor.  State
Purchasing did agree, however, to issue a supplemental bid to give Baker &amp;
Taylor another opportunity to supply the required documentation.  This process
is expected to take about a month.  If all requirements are fulfilled by the end
of this process, Baker &amp; Taylor will once more be included on the list.    	
</P>
<P>There are a number of approved vendors on the list, which can be viewed on
the <A HREF="http://www.state.nm.us/spd/swpa.html">State Purchasing</A> web
site.  When the screen comes up, go to &quot;Edit,&quot; click on &quot;Find in
page,&quot; and type &quot;Books&quot; in the dialog box.  A list of book
categories will come up.  Click on &quot;Online&quot; to see the listing of
legal contractors.  Your computer must have Adobe Acrobat loaded to access this
list.  State Purchasing strongly suggests that agencies and institutions
consider these other vendors and the discounts they offer.   		</P>
<P>If you have encountered a problem, please contact Scott Sheldon at the State
Library at (505) 476-9728 or e-mail <A HREF="mailto:lsheldon@stlib.state.nm.us"><I>lsheldon@stlib.state.nm.us</I></A>.
