<P>The Local History and Genealogy Section of the Trenton Public Library

is home to the Trentoniana Collection, the largest single collection of

photographs, manuscripts, books, etc., chronicling the history of Trenton,

New Jersey.</P>



<P>The Trentoniana photograph collection highlights various Trenton street

scenes, landmark buildings, portraits, etc. It consists of major Trenton

postcard, lantern slide, and portrait collections, as well as various photographic

scrapbooks. Another portion of the photographic collection is made up of

the Trenton Tax Assessor Office (TAO) Records. This collection, developed

by the City of Trenton's Tax Assessor's Office, documents nearly every

property, dwelling and industrial site within the city in 1936 with a photograph

and descriptive card.</P>



<P>The Local History and Genealogy manuscript collection, some of which is in <A HREF="../microfilm/micro.html">microform</A>,

includes a wide variety of records and papers of business, government and

voluntary associations, as well as some personal papers, legal documents

and local histories. Among the larger holdings is an extensive collection

of records of local labor unions and Trenton volunteer fire companies.

A substantial portion of the collection includes Trenton area business,

as well as church, cemetery and voluntary association records, diaries

and family papers, genealogies, legal documents, maps and other materials.</P>



<P>The Local History and Genealogy Collection includes the most extensive representation

of Trenton histories, books, monographs, serials, scrapbooks, periodicals,

pamphlets, etc. A significant portion of this collection consists of local

newspapers (most in microform) printed in Trenton from 1777 to the present.

<P>A number of indexes to parts of the collection are available.</P>
