The Internet Room is now open but does <b>not</b> have regularly scheduled hours of operation and may occasionally be closed to the public. All users must register first. A significant amount of the funding for the Computer Room at the Main Library and all
of the computers and printers used to access the Internet at the Branches were provided by Technology Grants administered by the New Jersey State Library.
