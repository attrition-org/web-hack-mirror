Submitting a good general resume willhelp you and us as we work together to target your resume for a particularposition.<p>Rewriting resumes is part of ASCI's hands-on philosophy.  Ourbackground as engineers and as managers lets us focus on what you've learnedand accomplished and put it into language which really communicateswith prospective managers.  <h2>Tell Us About Your Professional Self</h2><p>Themanagers who review your resume will need to see that you have the particularskills and approach which makes them want to interview you.Therefore, we need to know <em>everything</em> about what you'vedone professionally so that we can find a good fit between youand an opening.So, please give us information on <em>all</em>the things you've done.  Handwritten resume updates are fine!<h2>Be Concise...</h2><p>As a communication software developer, you already know thatit's trivial to support many data rates.  This means you shouldn'tlist each of the 13 data rates supported by that cool terminal driver youwrote.<h2>...But Not Too Concise</h2><p>At the same time that you're being concise, don't forget to mentionimportantthings.  If your cool terminal driver was developed on Unix and portedto Windows NT, be sure to mention this.<h2><a name="Readability">Readability Matters</a></h2><p>Software engineers aren't artists, or architects, for that matter, but ithelps to have a simple and clean layout for your resume.  If we'reconfused by your formatting, we may miss some vital detail of somethingyou've done.<h2>Tell Us Where You Can Be Reached</h2><p>It may be hard to imagine, but sometimes people completely omit theiraddresses and phone numbers and we have no way to contact them!Please remember toinclude yours at the top of your resume.  Additionally, when you supplya phone number, be sure toidentify whether it applies to the daytime or the evening.  These simplesteps can cut days out of the time it takes to reach you, which may makeall the difference in finding a job for you!<h2>Avoid Unusual Acronyms</h2><p> You don't need tospell out every acronym, but many acronyms are not used outside ofa particular company.  If you use such an acronym, the reader may notunderstand that you actually have just the experience that they'relooking for.  If in doubt, spell it out.<p>The same advice applies to technical terms.  For example,IBM calls display points on a screen"pels", but most others use the term "pixels".If you don't know how the rest of the world describes what you are doing,study up on it.  It could open up new opportunities for you.<h2>Be Realistic</h2><p>Be honest about what you know.So, if you have two years of experience, you should avoid saying that youare an expert in C++, Ada and Smalltalk.We and the experienced managers who will be looking at your resumecan spot an exaggeration.<h2>Lines Have 72 Characters</h2><p>We may be in the electronic age with bit-mapped displays everywhere,but the common medium of exchange is still an ASCII document, assumed tobe comprised of fixed width characters, no more than 80 on a line.Since 80 characterswill wrap, it's best to use something less.  We recommend your linesbe no longer than 72 characters.Tabs are assumed to be every eight characters.The only control characters allowed aretabs and line delimiters.<ul><li>ASCI can also accept PostScript and PDF, butsimple ASCII text is preferred.<li>Resumes in Microsoft Word are frequently scrambled by mailers.  Weprefer other file formats.<li>Special note to MacOS users: if you have bullets in your resumecreated by typing option-8, those are naughty 8-bit characters.  Replacingthem with a lowercase "o" works well for most purposes.</ul><h2>Make Sure You Are Sending Text</h2><p>Mailers are very complicated things these days, as are the wordprocessing programs we all use.  If you are not positive that yourresume file is free of strange characters, it's bestto check it out by first sending your resume to yourself and verifyingthat no odd data appears.<h2>Check Your Spelling and Grammar</h2><p>It's best to get someone to proofread your resume for you, but spellingcheckers are very good these days and you can catch many grammaticalerrors just by reading it out loud.<h2>Fill Out A Profile</h2><p>We always ask that you senda resume <em>and</em>, if you have a forms-capable browser,please submit an </A><A HREF="application.html">Application form</A>, as well.  A resume is a simple listing of what you <em>have</em>done, but our application form lets you tell us where you want to live and work, and other importantinformation.</b><P><center><img src="gifs/bottombar.gif" usemap="#bottombar" height=37 width=600 border=0><map name="bottombar"><area shape=rect coords="14,  3, 77,  32" href="index.html"><area shape=rect coords="84,  4, 141,  33" href="about.html"><area shape=rect coords="152,  5, 237,  32" href="/cgi.bin/Double_Search/db_search.cgi?setup_file=positions.setup"><area shape=rect coords="249,  4, 309,  32" href="career.html"><area shape=rect coords="318,  5, 412,  31" href="candidate.html"><area shape=rect coords="421,  6, 498,  31" href="resume.html"><area shape=rect coords="506,  7, 583,  30" href="contact.html"></map><br><Font size=2><I>For questions regarding this website, please contact the <a href="mailto:webmaster@infinity.nu">webmaster</a>.</I></center></BODY></HTML>
