Hypnotize your eyes.  (2 sec pauze and say this in a foreign accent)<br>
Fantisize your lives. (2 sec pauze and also say this shit fucked up and slow)<br>
You have a lifetime subscription to a zine called bullshit.<br>
(intro)<br>
Bullshit.<br>
--<br>
Bullshit!<br>
--<br>
Bullshit!!!<br>
<br>
So what is this bullshit? its a magazine.<br>
a fuckin book with a look you've never seen.<br>
a fuckin freestlye act, thats a fact. <br>
multiply it by 3, add 2 and subtract.<br>
and ya get an equation to the bullshit that ya lack.<br>
I mean, everyday i get up and every night i sleep<br>
i dig myself a hole thats 6 feet deep.<br>
i try to hold it together now but forever --- it creeps.<br>
and i end up with more of it then i can keep.<br>
--<br>
Bullshit! (repeat 3 times)<br>
--<br>
AHH! Help me now. ITs so hard to control.<br>
I try to get rid of it but to get rid of it<br>
i'd have to get out of this hole. ya know.<br>
<br>
as i climb out, the deeper it grows.<br>
Blood red is my eyes and my cries are slow.<br>
Swallowed by a new breed of shit called greed<br>
i live my life out and pleed to be freed.<br>
A new shit-stained game called natural selection<br>
tries to overcome me with corrections and redirections.<br>
i try to withhold but withdraw overall.<br>
and i'm left holdin the bag as i lag and fall.<br>
even as i'm dead, i don't think it will quit.<br>
Coz i still get - a lifetime subscription to a zine called Bullshit.<br>
--<br>
Bullshit (repeat 3 times)<br>
--<br>
(chorus)<br>
Hypnotize your eyes<br>
Fantisize your lives<br>
Visualize your death as its grows.<br>
And welcome to the hell of the bullshit trolls.<br>
--<br>
I'm sick of it, it smells like shit.<br>
More and more of this fuckin bullshit.<br>
Why oh why? is it just me? <br>
the fact that no one else can see, what all this bullshit does to me.<br>
<br>
Not anymore am i takin it. Not anymore for me.<br>
Not anymore am i takin it. Not anymore for me.<br>
Not anymore am i takin it. Not anymore for me.<br>
Not anymore am i takin it. I just wanna be free.<br>

FUCK ALL THAT BULLSHIT!<br>
--<br>
Bullshit (repeat 3 times)<br>
