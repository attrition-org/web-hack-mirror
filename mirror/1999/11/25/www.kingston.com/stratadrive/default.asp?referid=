			<strong>Your notebook computer may not be obsolete! </strong>
			</font>
			<br><br>
			Notebook computers are becoming more important as
			they assume additional roles in the corporate computing environment. Corporations are
			integrating notebooks at an increasing rate, and these notebooks are more expensive than
			desktops. Effective management of notebook assets will therefore pay greater dividends
			than with desktops. This makes it crucial to look at notebooks when managing total cost of
			ownership.
			<br><br>
			As notebooks become primary computers, users are
			experiencing increased demands for more storage. Today's notebooks can easily run out
			of storage in 6 to 18 months, which is well before the useful life of the computer has
			ended.
			<br><br>
			The useful life of the installed notebook base can be
			extended 12 to 24 months by upgrading the hard drive. The investment required for this is
			only 15% to 30% of the replacement cost of a new system. This enables users to get the
			data storage and processing capabilities they need, while freeing up investment capital
			for other corporate requirements.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Increased data</strong>
			<BR><BR>
			Data and application storage requirements have
			increased continuously for the last 4 decades, a trend which shows no sign of slowing.
			Storage capacity increases at a rate of about 60% per year. The appetite for storage is
			insatiable.
			<br><br>
			Corporate computers exist to collect, manipulate, and
			share data. New data storage demands are being brought on by such drivers as sales force
			automation, e-mail (text, audio, and video), video and multimedia presentations, internet
			data searches and data retrieval, and graphics-intensive desktop publishing and
			engineering CAD work. These drivers increase both the space required for data as well as
			the applications that manipulate it. Notebook users are experiencing these demands for
			more storage as notebooks become their primary computers.
			<BR><BR>
			<strong>Insufficient hard drive space</strong>
			<br><br>
			Storage requirements increase continually as hard
			drives are filled with new applications, larger software upgrades, and user data files.
			Smaller capacities were adequate when mobile computers were used mainly as companion
			devices for personal calendars, e-mail, and memos. However, storage requirements are
			increasing significantly, now that notebooks are becoming primary machines.
			<br><br>
			Because notebooks are being used as primary machines,
			their storage requirements must meet or exceed the requirements of the user's desktop
			(or ex-desktop) machine. This storage problem is easily solved in the same way it is
			solved with desktop machines - inexpensive hard drive upgrades.
			<BR><BR>
			<font face="verdana, arial" size="3">
			<strong>Past Barriers to notebook upgrades...</strong>
			</font>
			<BR><BR>
			The upgrade "tool" has been largely untapped in the notebook arena, even though notebooks
			are more expensive and have become widely deployed. Some of the reasons behind the delayed
			adoption of notebook hard drive upgrades are discussed below.
			<BR><BR>
			<strong>Awareness</strong>
			<BR><BR>
			Relatively few people are actually aware that
			notebook hard drives can be upgraded. From a casual glance at a notebook computer, it is
			often not obvious that it can be upgraded. The sturdy enclosure and tightly integrated
			design might give the impression that notebooks shouldn't be opened.
			<BR><BR>
			A lack of awareness has probably been exacerbated by
			the perceived complexity required to disassemble the notebook and install the new drive.
			Additionally, it formerly was very difficult to get your old data to your new drive; it
			didn't make much sense to add capacity if you couldn't move your data. All this
			complexity made it unlikely that people would pass the word that upgrading was a practical
			alternative.
			<BR><BR>
			<strong>Complexity</strong>
			<BR><BR>
			The upgrade process was complex, aggravating, and
			time-consuming in the past for all but a select few. It could easily take several hours,
			or as much as a day or more, to complete the entire upgrade process. There wasn't a
			strong enough case for most people to undertake such an arduous procedure. StrataDrive
			Plus, a new generation of notebook hard drive upgrade, is now available. The StrataDrive
			Plus solution includes everything required in one box, and the upgrade is tailored for
			individual notebook models.
			<BR><BR>
			<font face="verdana, arial" size="3">
			<strong>Features and Benefits of notebook hard drive upgrades</strong>
			</font>
			<BR><BR>
			<strong>Cost</strong>
			<BR><BR>
			Cost considerations decisively favor upgrades over
			purchasing a new notebook. A notebook user might run out of disk space after 6 to 18
			months. If the disk drive can be upgraded for approximately 15% to 30% of the cost of a
			new notebook, and if this extends the useful life of the notebook another 12 to 24 months,
			the cost savings are substantial.
			<BR><BR>
			The total savings can be quite large in organizations
			with a big installed base of notebooks. Assuming an installed base of 3000 notebooks and
			an upgrade rate of 50%, hard drive upgrades can easily save more than $1,000,000 per year.
			The money saved by extending the notebook useful lives can be re-deployed to more urgent
			or important IT issues. As an example, the freed up capital could be used to help resolve
			Y2K (year 2000) issues, or to add more network storage capacity.
			<BR><BR>
			Another hidden benefit of the upgrade option is in
			user support costs. With the StrataDrive Plus hard drive upgrades, the users retain the
			computer, applications, data, and configurations that they are accustomed to. The only
			change they will notice is the increase in available storage capacity. No re-training by
			the IT group is necessary, and the users are up and running immediately after receiving
			their upgraded machine.
			<BR><BR>
			<strong>Time</strong>
			<BR><BR>
			The time required to set up and configure a new
			notebook exceeds the time required to upgrade the hard drive. A new notebook requires
			installation of existing user applications, copying the user data from the old notebook
			(usually accomplished by transferring to a network drive and subsequently downloading it),
			and then configuring the new notebook (IP address, modem settings, application settings,
			etc).
			<BR><BR>
			<strong>Ease of Installation</strong>
			<BR><BR>
			The process of installing a notebook hard drive has
			been considerably simplified and shortened. A notebook hard drive upgrade can now be
			installed, complete with all of the existing applications and data, in 20 to 30 minutes.
			The process requires very little intervention or "hands-on" time from the user,
			and the cost is typically only 15% to 30% of the cost for a new computer. The users also
			get to keep the same "comfortable" configured machine (software and hardware)
			that they have become familiar with.
			<BR><BR>
			<font face="verdana, arial" size="3">
			<strong>Kingston's StrataDrive Plus</strong>
			</font>
			<BR><BR>
			The Kingston StrataDrive Plus is the easiest,
			quickest, and safest complete solution. What once took hours now takes minutes with
			Kingston's StrataDrive. Simply connect the included PC card to your notebook and run the
			drive image software. StrataMove automatically partitions and formats the new hard drive;
			transferring all files, applications and the operating system to the new drive. When the
			transfer process is complete, replace the original hard drive with the new StrataDrive
			<BR><BR>
			Kingston's StrataDrive upgrade solutions will boost
			your notebook's hard drive capacity to over ten times its original capacity. Designed for
			notebook computers from leading manufacturers including Compaq, IBM, Toshiba, Dell,
			Hewlett-Packard and NEC, Kingston's StrataDrive is available in a wide range of capacities
			to suit your needs.
			<BR><BR>
			<strong>Compatibility</strong>
			<BR><BR>
			Kingston's StrataDrive offers support for over 400
			leading notebook models including Toshiba, IBM, NEC, Compaq, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, AST
			and Dell. Each custom model is a complete solution that has been fully tested for
			compatibility and reliability to meet or exceed the original notebook manufacturer's drive
			specification. With a range of capacities from 4GB to 14GB there is hard drive customized
			for you.
			<BR><BR>
			<strong>Transferability</strong>
			<BR><BR>
			The PC Card port can be used to automatically
			configure the new drive and transfer files from the old drive. With the proper interface
			hardware and software, this can all take place before any work is done to the old drive or
			the notebook. This provides an added safety factor by preserving an intact copy of the
			original data.
			<BR><BR>
			The user ends up with a system that performs in
			exactly the same way as before (even the desktop will be the same). The software requires
			little or no user intervention to achieve this. The only directly noticeable difference
			should be the availability of more disk space. Since the user is already familiar with the
			OS and application set-up, no re-training will be required.
			<BR><BR>
			The StrataMove transfer software is Windows-based,
			and supports Windows 3.1, 95, 98, and NT. The Windows graphical user interface is
			intuitive and familiar, whereas the command line interface seems rather arcane and cryptic
			to most users. StrataMove is able to take the user through the entire process without the
			need to refer to a manual. An "express' option is available which automatically
			selects disk configuration options that are most likely to be optimum for the new drive. A
			custom option will also be available that allows experienced users to manually select such
			items as number of partitions and partition sizes. StrataMove is also able to deal with
			model-specific special issues (an example of this is the non-DOS diagnostic partition used
			by Compaq notebooks).
			<BR><BR>
			<strong>Ease of Installation</strong>
			<BR><BR>
			Upgrading a notebook's hard drive is traditionally
			perceived as a difficult and time-consuming process, taking several hours and usually
			requiring technical expertise. StrataDrive simplifies the notebook hard drive upgrade
			process, making it so easy that even a non-technical user can do it.
			<BR><BR>
			StrataDrive installs in three easy steps:
			<BR><BR>
			<ul>
			<li>Insert PC Card adapter and run StrataMove transfer utility
			<li>Unpackage StrataDrive from ESD packaging
			<li>Replace old hard drive with new high capacity StrataDrive
			</ul>
			The new generation of hard drive upgrades makes
			the installation process simple, fast, safe, and reliable. The available solutions fit a
			range of support models. For centralized upgrades, fully tested drives are available that
			have been pre-mounted in custom enclosures. Complete tool kits are also available to aid
			the transfer of data, applications, and OS for these centralized upgrades. End users, such
			as personnel in remote offices and SOHO environments, can find everything they need for an
			upgrade in one box.
			<BR><BR>
			Storage upgrades are an excellent tool for managing
			the life cycle of your notebook computer investments. Substantial cost savings can be
			realized while continuing to give users the computing resources they require. This tool
			has been widely used in desktop machines, and it will become much more common in notebooks
			as they assume more prominent roles in the corporate computing environment.
