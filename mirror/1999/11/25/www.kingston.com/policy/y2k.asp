<B>Year 2000 Compliance Statement</B>
</FONT>
<BR><BR>
<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE=2>
The purpose of this document is to provide you with an update on Kingston Technology Company's ("KTC") Year 2000 Compliance status. As you are aware, the Year 2000 issue has been well documented and widely publicized. KTC recognizes the Year 2000 transition as a serious business issue and has taken steps to minimize Year 2000 problems; not only from within, but also from our suppliers and in the products we manufacture and sell to our customers. Overall Year 2000 Compliance efforts will continue into 1999.
<BR><BR>
<b><U>What are Year 2000 Problems?</U></b>
<BR><BR>
Year 2000 Problems (often referred to as Y2K, or the Millennium Bug) result from a programming practice implemented years ago to save memory space by using only the last two digits of the year (i.e. 12/31/98). When the year 2000 arrives, some computers may, among other problems, be unable to distinguish between the year 2000 and the year 1900. In addition some systems may encounter problems due to the failure to recognize the Year 2000 as a leap year. Furthermore, the use of certain dates, such as "9/9/99", which can be interpreted as end, end-of-file, or other status indication, or even simply the use of the number "99" to signify something other than a date, may induce errors. These problems, generically referred to as "the Year 2000 Problems", may cause information systems and equipment to malfunction or even cease operation entirely.
<BR><BR>
It is recognized that a simple universal fix for every system does not exist. Each company must examine its own computer systems (i.e. hardware and software) to verify that date/time processing in a two-digit format will not cause errors in either the software programming or hardware architecture of their operations prior to, during and after the Year 2000. 
<BR><BR>
<b><U>"Year 2000 Compliance" Definition:</U></b>
<BR><BR>
A specific definition of the term "Year 2000 Compliance", also referred to as "Year 2000 Conformity", reduces the possibility that different readers will have varying interpretations.  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 96-607) governs the federal guidelines regarding Year 2000 Compliance.  This regulation and a later amended interim rule are designed to assist the federal government in acquiring information technology systems and products which accurately process date/time data subsequent to December 31, 1999. 
<BR><BR>
KTC defines Year 2000 Compliance in accordance with the criteria prepared by British Standards Institution Committee BDD/1/-/3. The following Year 2000 Conformity requirements clearly define that neither performance nor functionality is affected by dates prior to, during and after the year 2000. 
<br><br>
<b>In particular:</b>
<UL>
<b>Rule 1.</b>	No value for current date will cause any interruption in 
operation.<BR>
<b>Rule 2.</b>	Date-based functionality must behave consistently for dates 
prior to, during and after year 2000.<BR>
<b>Rule 3.</b>	In all interfaces and data storage, the century in any date 
must be specified either explicitly or by unambiguous algorithms or 
inferencing rules.<BR>
<b>Rule 4.</b>	Year 2000 must be recognized as a leap year.
</UL>
<b><U>KTC's Compliance Efforts:</U></b><BR><BR>
To prepare for this Year 2000 transition, KTC has taken some major steps in our compliance effort to minimize its related problems. In early-1998, our senior management assigned a Y2k Project Team (the"Team") that consists of a cross-functional representation from information technology, procurement, manufacturing, test and development, finance, general affairs, engineering, marketing, and facilities organizations, etc., to address our Year 2000 issues. The Team subsequently expanded to a 25-member strong Team with an addition of several technical experts from KTC's overseas operations that include KTCFE, KTCIE and KT Europe. The Vice President of MIS and the Vice President of Administration maintain the overall responsibilities for Year 2000 readiness across the company. Assessment/rectification phase of our year 2000 efforts and full compliance for all mission critical internal systems were accomplished as scheduled by the end of Q4 1998. Contingency development and validation of our overall Year 2000 readiness will continue into 1999. 
<br><br>
The following strategically important categories have been assessed for 
Year 2000 readiness:
<BR><BR>
<b><U>Suppliers &amp; Service Providers Readiness:</U></b><BR>
<UL>
<b>Summary:
<LI>All major strategic suppliers are assessed to be Year 2000 compliant.
<LI>Most of our service providers' compliance efforts will continue into 1999.
<LI>Major concerns and efforts will be focused on our shipping companies in 1999.</b>
</UL>
To assure that our suppliers and service providers will be interruption-free in the year 2000 and beyond, the Team conducted an extensive survey on our strategically important suppliers and service providers regarding their Year 2000 Conformity. This survey assesses our supplier's management awareness of the Year 2000 issue and their information systems' and products' Year 2000 Compliance. This process was designed for us to better understand our suppliers' and service providers' Year 2000 Compliance approach and assist them, if necessary, to achieve Year 2000 readiness.
<BR><BR>
As a result of the Team’s effort, all major suppliers were assessed to be 
compliant. A small percentage of suppliers polled have not returned our 
request letters. <b>Banks:</b> : Verification process of our major banks has been completed. <b>Electricity:</b> 100% by mid-1999. <b>Gas:</b> 100% by 2Q99.  <b>Water:</b> 100% ready. <b>Telephones:</b> Local carrier will be ready in 2Q99. Our long distance carrier reports they will be ready in 1Q99. <b>Shipping:</b> Only one smaller company has been Year 2000 compliant since December 1998. One major company reports they will be ready by May 31,1999. Another major company's scheduled date for Year 2000 compliance has not yet been established.
<BR><BR>
<b><U>KTC Internal Systems:</U></b><BR><BR>
<UL>
<b>Summary:
<LI>· All mission critical internal systems are determined to be Year 2000 compliant.
<LI>A few minor Year 2000 Related issues need to be addressed in 1999.</b>
</UL>
The Team commenced Year 2000 activity on our internal systems early in 1998. This focused activity, headed by a team of experts from MIS, has been continually reviewing our entire inventory of hardware and software and assessing the impact of Y2K on our computer systems, production, and test equipment. The Team developed a comprehensive plan to analyze and begin the implementation of any changes necessary to properly process date fields prior to, during, and after the turn of the century. By the end of 1998, the Team completed the process, as scheduled, of reviewing all of our internal systems for Year 2000 readiness, upgrading them where necessary; correcting or replacing any components of the systems that would not accurately process date information.  
<BR><BR>
Embedded Logic processors in tools and facilities were investigated for Year 2000 readiness. At the end of 1998, all process-control, test, monitoring, production, and packaging equipment, as well as any other devices relying on embedded processors, such as our facility security systems, have been inventoried, assessed, tested and upgraded as required for Year 2000 compliance. 
<BR><BR>
<b><U>KTC Products:</U></b><BR><BR>
<UL>
<b>Summary:
<LI>KTC products are Year 2000 compliant.</b>
</UL>
KTC products are in full compliance and, at the same time, we are continually monitoring our new product hardware/software development. KTC manufactures system enhancements such as memory, processor upgrades, storage enclosures, and networking products designed to work in computer systems which may fall under the Year 2000 Compliance ruling. However, KTC products are hardware upgrades, which, by their form and function, have no direct impact on the system's ability to calculate date/time processing in either the software programming or hardware architecture of the information technology system they are designed to support.
<BR><BR>
<b><U>Contingency Plans:</U></b><BR><BR>
<UL>
<b>Summary:
<LI>The development of contingency plans will be continued in 1999.</b>
</UL>
The development efforts of our Year 2000 contingency plans, considered by our senior management to be one of the most important objectives, will be continued and focused in 1999.  MIS has taken the lead and worked with our Finance Department to develop comprehensive Year 2000 Contingency plans for our mission critical application systems to assure the continuity of our daily business.
