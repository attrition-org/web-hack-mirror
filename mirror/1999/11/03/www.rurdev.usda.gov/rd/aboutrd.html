<TD>
Helping the people of rural America develop sustainable communities and
improve their quality of life is the goal of <B>USDA's Rural Development
mission area</B>.  USDA believes rural Americans have a right to the same
quality of life as is enjoyed by people who live in suburban and urban
areas.
<P>
<B>Rural Development</B> is working to eliminate substandard housing from rural
America by helping rural people buy, build or rent decent housing.  It
also creates jobs by funding the growth and creation of rural businesses
and cooperatives.  In a typical year, Rural Development programs create
or preserve more than 150,000 rural jobs, enable 40,000 to 50,000 rural
Americans to buy homes and help 450,000 low-income rural people rent
apartments or other housing.
<P>
Other <B>Rural Development</B> programs help rural communities build or improve
community facilities, such as schools, health clinics and fire
stations.  Rural Development also has programs that help rural
communities build or extend utilities, including water, electricity and
telecommunications services.
<P>
Program assistance is provided in many ways, including direct or
guaranteed loans, grants, technical assistance, research and educational
materials.  To accomplish its mission, <B>USDA Rural Development</B> often
works in partnership with state, local and tribal governments, as well
as rural businesses, cooperatives and nonprofit agencies.
<P>
USDA Rural Development programs are delivered through three of its
sister agencies: <B>Rural Utilities Service</B> (RUS) addresses rural America's
need for basic services such as clean running water, sewers and waste
disposal, electricity, and telecommunications. The <B>Rural Housing Service</B>
(RHS) addresses rural America's need for single-family and multi-family
housing as well as health facilities, fire and police stations, and
other community facilities. The <B>Rural Business-Cooperative Service</B> (RBS)
provides help to rural areas that need to develop new job opportunities,
allowing businesses and cooperatives to remain viable in a changing
economy.
<P>
In addition, the Federal Government is seeking to form partnerships with
other entities-- such as state, local, and tribal governments, private
and nonprofit organizations, and member- owned cooperatives--to
revitalize rural areas. <B>Rural Development</B> programs are provided across
the Nation through 47 state offices and 800 area and local offices.
