<center><h3>Meeting the Challenges of Rural America</h3></center>

<font size=2><p>Welcome to USDA Rural Development.  USDA's Rural Development 
is committed to helping improve the economy and quality of life in all of rural America. Through
our programs, we touch rural America in many ways.  
Our financial programs support such essential public facilities and services 
as water and sewer systems, housing, health clinics, emergency service 
facilities and electric and telephone service.  We promote economic 
development by supporting loans to businesses through banks and community-managed lending
pools.  We offer technical assistance and information to 
help agricultural and other cooperatives get started and improve the 
effectiveness of their member services.  And we provide technical assistance 
to help communities undertake community empowerment programs.</p>

<p>Like all of government, USDA Rural Development is reinventing itself.  In 
the last two years, we have consolidated our organization and reduced 
administrative costs by centralizing servicing for some of our most important 
programs.  We have put the focus of our programs where it belongs: on 
empowering communities to take charge of their own development.  And -- 
through innovations such as the World Wide Web -- we are bringing more of 
our services to your doorstep in an effort to improve convenience to you 
while cutting costs. Please take a look at our site and see the services we offer.</p></font>
