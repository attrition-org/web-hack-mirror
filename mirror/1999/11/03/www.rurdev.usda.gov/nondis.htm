<blockquote>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) prohibits discrimination in all
its programs and activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, religion, age, disability, political beliefs, sexual orientation, and marital or familial status.  (Not all prohibited bases apply to all programs.)  Persons with
disabilities who require alternative means for communication of program information (Braille,
large print, audiotape, etc.) should contact USDA's TARGET Center at (202) 720-2600 (voice
and TDD).
<p>
To file a complaint of discrimination, write USDA, Director, Office of Civil Rights, Room 326-W, Whitten Building, 14th and Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C. 20250-9410 or call (202) 720-5964 (voice or TDD).  USDA is an
equal opportunity provider and employer.
