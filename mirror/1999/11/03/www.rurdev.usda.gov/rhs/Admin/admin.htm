    <strong><small><font face="Times New Roman">Eileen Fitzgerald, Acting Administrator </font></small></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We're proud of what the agency has accomplished.&nbsp;
    Since the end of 1997 we've assisted more than 100,000 people to become homeowners for the
    first time.&nbsp; Since that time RHS has also helped over 20,000 families and individuals
    make needed repairs to their homes, like fixing leaking roofs and adding insulation or
    central heating.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">RHS makes rents affordable for people living in rural
    areas. It provides direct loans, makes loan guarantees, and provides grants and technical
    support to help housing developers create clean, safe, affordable housing in rural
    areas.&nbsp; RHS helps ensure that the elderly, people with disabilities, and people in
    extremely remote areas have the resources they need to live rich, full lives.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rural people interested in the American dream of owning
    their homes can apply for RHS programs to help them make a downpayment and find financing.
    &nbsp; Through RHS' groundbreaking Self-Help Housing Program, rural individuals and
    families can build &quot;sweat equity&quot; by helping construct their homes themselves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Recently, a special effort has been made to bring more
    child care centers to rural America than ever before.&nbsp; Rural Housing Service programs
    bring needed additions to thousands of rural communities each year, like health clinics,
    public libraries, social services buildings, school computer centers, and firefighting
    equipment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1999, Rural Housing's single-family housing programs
    will celebrate their 50th birthday.&nbsp; This occasion gives cause for reflection on the
    improvements that have been made in rural American life since a 1945 USDA survey indicated
    a majority of rural Americans lacked indoor plumbing and structurally sound, safe homes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We are pleased to report that the Rural Housing Service is
    working with more partners in the private, nonprofit, and public sectors than ever before,
    which enables loan and grant dollars to reach many more people. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Please take a look around!&nbsp; We hope you like what you
    see. </font></p>
