    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All questions concerning your existing loan should be

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mail payments to the address on your billing statement. Do
    not mail payments directly to the CSC street address. Payments are past due if the total
    amount due is not received by the due date. If the account is past due more than 15 days,
    a late fee will be applied to your account. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The CSC offers all borrowers lower payments (payment
    subsidy), deferred payments (moratorium assistance), counseling, and all other services
    which historically were provided by local offices. The toll-free phone number is available
    24 hours a day for basic loan information; to speak to a loan counselor, call between the

    assistance (lower payments), moratorium relief (deferred payments), or counseling to help

    form received with your introductory letter and return it with a blank check across which
    you have written &quot;VOID&quot;. Allow 45 days for us to process your application. It is
    important to remember that you must have enough money in your account to cover the monthly
    payment. Please continue to send your payment by check until notified.</font> </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000">Yes, you can send extra money over
    your payment amount to reduce principal. In order for the extra payment to be applied to
    principal, your loan must be current and have no outstanding fees. Please indicate the
    additional amount toward principal in the appropriate box on your monthly billing
    statement.</font> </font></p>

    insurance? What is an escrow account?</font></b> </font></a></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000">All borrowers are required to pay
    real estate taxes and property insurance premiums. An account for the payment of taxes and
    insurance is established for all new loans. This is called an escrow account. Long-time
    borrowers with loans not on escrow may request an escrow account to be established at any
    time.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000">For long-time borrowers who are not
    on escrow and fail to pay your taxes or insurance premium, the CSC will pay them, charge
    the amount to your accounts, and establish an escrow account. This will increase your
    monthly payment.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000">Once you are on escrow, your account
    will be reviewed at least once each year based on the most recent changes to your tax bill
    and/or insurance premium. This may result in an increase or decrease to your payment.</font>
