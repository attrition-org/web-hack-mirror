    homeownership opportunities to low and moderate-income rural Americans through several

    the form of a home loan at an affordable interest rate. </font></p>
    <p><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman">Most of the loans made under the Direct
    Loan Program are to families with income below 80% of the median income level in the
    communities where they live. Since RHS is able to make loans to those who will not qualify
    for a conventional loan, the RHS Direct Loan program enables many more people to buy homes
    than might otherwise be possible.</font><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><font
    color="000000" face="Times New Roman">Direct loans may be made for the purchase of an

    individual or family may borrow up to 100% of the appraised value of the home, which
    eliminates the need for a down payment. Since a common barrier to owning a home for many
    low-income people is the lack of funds to make a down payment, the availability of the
    Guaranteed Loan program from RHS makes the reality of owning a home available to a much
    larger percentage of Americans. </font></p>
