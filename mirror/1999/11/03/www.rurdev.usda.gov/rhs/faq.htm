    <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Rural Housing Service (RHS)
    is an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Located within the Department's
    Rural Development mission area, RHS operates a broad range of programs to provide:</font><ul>
      <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">homeownership options to
        individuals;</font></li>
      <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">housing rehabilitation and
        preservation funding;</font></li>
      <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">rental assistance to tenants of
        RHS-funded multi-family housing complexes; </font></li>
      <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">farm labor housing;</font></li>
      <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">help to developers of multi-family
        housing projects, like assisted housing for the elderly and disabled, or apartment
        buildings; and </font></li>
      <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">community facilities, such as
        libraries, child care centers, schools, municipal buildings, and firefighting equipment to
        Indian groups, nonprofit organizations, communities and local governments. <br>
        </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>(Please check the description
    of each program for a full listing of who is eligible to receive assistance, and for
    specifics of what each program is designed to achieve.) </i></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">RHS administers direct loans,
    loan guarantees and grants. Direct loans are made and serviced by USDA staff; loan
    guarantees are made to banks or other private lenders, and grants are made directly to a
    person or organization. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000A0" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Does RHS work with other local
    and state organizations to provide its services to the community?</b> <a
    name="Does RHS work with other"></a></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">RHS works with other Federal
    agencies, and a number of both nonprofit and private organizations nationally, in order to
    pool resources to help America's rural residents most effectively. For a list of some of
    these organizations, please check the <a href="http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/other/hous.htm">Rural
    Development Housing Links page</a>.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000A0" face="Times New Roman"><b>Where are RHS offices located?<a
    name="Where are offices located"></a></b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The RHS National Office is
    located in Washington, D.C., and is responsible for setting policy, developing
    regulations, and performing oversight. In the field, RHS operations are carried out
    through the USDA's state and local Rural Development offices and service centers, several
    of which are located in each state and Puerto Rico. (Four multistate offices exist in
    addition to local offices within the states -- Vermont/New Hampshire;
    Massachusetts/Connecticut/Rhode Island; Maryland/Delaware; and Florida/Virgin Islands.)</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Centralized Servicing Center,
    located in St. Louis, Missouri, provides loan origination and servicing directly to RHS
    Single-Family Housing borrowers.</font></p>

    2000-related problems?<a name="Y2K"></a></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All Rural Housing Service computers and programs have been
    certified free of Year 2000 problems by the Department of Agriculture's Year 2000 program
    office. For more information, click <a href="Y2K/y2k_toc.htm">here</a>.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000A0" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>What is the RHS service area?<a
    name="service area"></a></b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">RHS programs are available to
    eligible applicants in rural areas, typically defined as open country or rural towns with
    no more 20,000 in population. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">An exception to the rural
    eligibility requirements is the Farm Labor Housing Program (Section 514/516), which is the
    only Federal program available for development of housing for farm workers. This program
    is available in both rural and urban areas.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">To determine whether a particular
    site is located within an RHS-eligible area, contact the <a
    href="../recd_map.html">Rural Development office located in that
    state</a>.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#0000A0"><b>What is a NOFA, and how does it
    work?</b></font> </font><font color="#0000A0" face="Times New Roman"><a name="NOFA"></a></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Notice of Funding
    Availability (NOFA) is a notice published each year in the Federal Register for some RHS
    Multi-Family Housing programs. This notice describes the type of funding available on a
    competitive basis and provides a State contact where an application may be submitted,
    typically up to 60 to 90 days from the date of NOFA publication. Selection will then be
    made based upon factors such as median area income, local access to credit, and the
    availability of funding from other sources to be used to finance the project. Loan funds
    will be available within the same fiscal year the application is received.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000A0" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>How do I receive a copy of RHS
    regulations?<a name="Instructions"></a></b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The regulations that guide RHS
    programs are published in Chapter 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Most public
    libraries have copies of CFRs. Copies of our regulations, instructions, and handbooks can
    also be viewed in any Rural Development office, or can be downloaded and viewed online <a
    href="http://rdinit.usda.gov/regs/">here</a>. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">If the regulation you want is not
    available online, you can order a copy at any Rural Development office, or contact Rural
    Development, FC-313, 1520 Market Street, St. Louis, MO 63103. </font></td>
