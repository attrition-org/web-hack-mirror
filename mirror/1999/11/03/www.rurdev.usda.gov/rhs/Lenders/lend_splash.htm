    </big><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">The Rural Housing Service works with
    private lenders to guarantee loans to borrowers for the construction of multi-family
    housing units; community facilities; and individual homes.&nbsp; Most loan guarantees
    issued by the Rural Housing Service are from 80-100% of the amount of the loan. </font><p><font
    color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">The reasons investors might choose to work with the
    Rural Housing Service are many.&nbsp; Since loan guarantees issued by RHS are backed by
    the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury, many lenders consider RHS programs to be a
    relatively risk-free way to expand portfolios. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Also, loans made possible by partnerships
    between RHS and private lenders improve the economic health of rural communities.&nbsp;
    The continued well-being of rural areas provides more opportunities for lending
    institutions which invest in these communities </font></p>
