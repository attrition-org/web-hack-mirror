</b></font>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since April 1996, Statistics South Africa has been involved in a Y2K (Year 2000)
compliance project. The National Year 2000 Decision Support Centre (NYDSC) and the Office
of the Auditor-General are also involved in, or aware of this, project. </p>

<p>New computers and operating systems have been installed, and all software programmes in
use are either being rewritten or re-engineered to ensure compliance. Project plans
indicate that most, if not all, systems within Stats SA will be Y2K compliant in time. </p>

<p>However, Stats SA is dependent on a large number and variety of sources for statistical
input, and - at least at this stage - it is not possible to guarantee that the systems of
each and every Stats SA information supplier will be Y2K compliant by the due date. </p>
