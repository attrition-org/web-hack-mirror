<H3><A HREF="http://ais.its-program.anl.gov/">ADVANCE</A></H3>

<P>The ADVANCE Project was launched in 1991 as a major test of a dynamic-
in- vehicle- route guidance system in the United States. The objective was
to determine if motorists supplied with real-time guidance would be given
information which would help them avoid congestion and improve the quality
of their trip. The heart of ADVANCE is the Transportation Information Center
which receives information from a wide spectrum of sources, processes the
information, and makes it available to vehicles.</P>

<H3><A HREF="afvinfo.html">Alternative Fuel Vehicles</A></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Argonne National Laboratory supports alternative-fuel
vehicles (AFVs) both in theory and in practice. As its scientists study
new ways to power cars and trucks, Argonne's fleet is participating in an
AFV test program. </FONT>The Engines and Alternative Fuels Group is involved
in testing AFVs, encouraging the design of AFVs, and developing cleaner-burning
engines. To support these activities, Argonne maintains a fleet of 138 vehicles,
including alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs).</P>

<H3><A HREF="idlams.html">Natural Systems Modeling</A></H3>

<P>The Integrated Dynamic Landscape Analysis and Modeling System (IDLAMS)
is an integration of ecological models, decision support techniques, and
a geographic information system (GIS) that incorporates remote sensing and
field inventory data. Based on Department of Defense (DoD) user requirements,
the project objective is to create a methodology and develop a decision-support
system that will link the site military mission with the planning needs
for biological conservation and resource management on DoD installations.</P>

<H3><A HREF="plastics.html">Plastics Recovery</A></H3>

<P>Through collaborative research with industry, Argonne National Laboratory
is developing a process for recovering valuable individual plastics from
the non-metallic fractions generated by appliance shredding operations.
Further, to enhance the market penetration of recycled plastic materials,
cost-effective methods for improving the performance of the recovered plastics
is being developed.</P>

<H3><A HREF="rma.chem.html">Treating Agent-Contaminated Soils</A></H3>

<P>Soils contaminated by chemical warfare agents pose a unique remediation
problem for military installations. Argonne, a pioneer in studying the problem
of agent-contaminated soils, is evaluating different treatment technologies
for treating such soils at Rocky Mountain Arsenal. The chemical warfare
agents most likely to be encountered at the Arsenal are the blister agents,
mustard and lewisite, and the nerve agents, GB and VX. Success in identifying
effective remediation technologies will pave the way for full-scale treatment
of the Arsenal's agent-contaminated soil and may also have applicability
to other kinds of contamination problems.</P>
