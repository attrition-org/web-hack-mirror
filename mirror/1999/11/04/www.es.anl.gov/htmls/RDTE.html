<P><B>Facility staff are dedicated to research excellence.</B></P>

<P>The ANL RDT&amp;E Analytical Chemistry Laboratory staff are proven experts
in developing and validating analytical methods for trace levels (sub-ppb)
of agents on surfaces and in environmental matrices. The staff are experienced
in developing field sampling and analytical protocols including the development
of portable analytical instrumentation.</P>

<P>The ANL RDT&amp;E Research and Development Laboratory staff are available
to design and perform technology evaluation and feasibility testing. The
staff have the experience to develop physical, chemical, biological, and
thermal approaches to the treatment of agent-contaminated liquids, soils,
and other solid materials (e.g., equipment and construction materials).
Laboratory staff develop and evaluate innovative approaches to neutralize
and decontaminate agents on surfaces including those disseminated over large
areas. Staff develop and validate sensors and portable detection instrumentation,
and investigate environmental fate and transport of chemical contaminants.<BR>
