<P><B>Problem/Opportunity</B></P>

<P>New challenges face resource planners in the Department of Defense (DoD)
and Department of Energy (DOE) as they seek to fulfill their land stewardship
requirements with limited funding. On-site and off-site environmental impacts,
wildlife conservation issues, cultural resources concerns, and the need
for training realism all dictate that natural resources be maintained and
enhanced on these installations. The tasks of balancing multiple military
and nonmilitary land uses, complying with resource regulations, and assessing
the impacts on the sustainability of both the resource base and the military
mission are complex and challenging. Management actions to alleviate one
resource problem can often exacerbate others. In order to make the most
efficient use of available resources, it is necessary to make trade-offs
so that the most valuable and effective efforts are funded first, and less
valuable efforts are only pursued if funds are available. At a time when
conservation funding is growing increasingly scarce and the demands for
adequate justification of decision making are growing stronger, a new dynamic
approach is needed to help resource managers in their decision-making.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Approach</B></P>

<P>To fulfill this need a new approach is underway with funding from the
Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) and work
conducted by the Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory (ANL)
and the U.S. Army's Construction Engineering Research Laboratories (USACERL).
Called the Integrated Dynamic Landscape Analysis and Modeling System (IDLAMS),
it is an integration of ecological models, decision support techniques,
and a geographic information system (GIS) that incorporates remote sensing
and field inventory data. Based on DoD user requirements, the project objective
is to create a methodology and develop a decision-support system that will
link the site military mission with the planning needs for biological conservation
and resource management on DoD installations.</P>

<P>The development of IDLAMS will assist the decision-makers in identifying
and resolving land-use issues and help determine cost-effective solutions
to long-term land stewardship problems. The approach offers a computer technology
that enables resource managers to integrate their planning process by identifying
multiple land use objectives and incorporating trade-off analysis, determining
the cost and economics of viable land management alternatives, and incorporating
&quot;what if&quot; scenarios into their decision-making. The user-friendly
interface allows the resource manager to operate this predictive, decision-making
and planning tool without the need for substantial GIS training or extensive
environmental modeling expertise.</P>

<P>The central component of IDLAMS is a vegetation (land cover) change model,
which incorporates naturally occurring changes, changes due to training
use, and those resulting from resource management activities. Other management
concerns such as soil erosion, water quality, wildlife, and cultural resources
can also be modeled and linked to the vegetation dynamics submodel. Also,
SERDP has funded other research efforts that can provide additional submodels
to the IDLAMS framework and has facilitated the coordination among complimentary
projects. For example, the system currently being tested at Fort Riley,
Kansas, can model and predict changes in vegetation type that might result
from fire, forest/shrub expansion, or secondary succession of grassland
following training activity disturbances. It also has submodels for soil
erosion prediction and wildlife habitat suitability analyses. In addition
to the GIS spatial analysis component, ANL is investigating the use of advanced,
remote-sensing technologies to provide large-scale, high-resolution images
for use in the overall dynamic landscape model.</P>

<P>Although principally an ecological modeling environment, IDLAMS also
uses a value-based decision-analysis process to link the ecological models
with the management needs and user requirements of the resource manager.
To help accomplish this task, ANL held a two-day workshop bringing together
land managers from several representative installations (Fort Riley, Kansas
and Fort McCoy, Wisconsin) and natural resource experts from ANL and USACERL.
The workshop was facilitated by Dr. Ralph Keeney, an internationally-known
expert in the field of decision-analysis. Participants met to develop operational
definitions for land management objectives, determine and prioritize a list
of relevant objectives to be used, and define measures to estimate the extent
to which those objectives are reached and can be incorporated into a decision-support
system. The information gathered at this initial workshop, and through a
follow-up workshop, is currently being quantified and will be used to develop
and test the decision-support system. This system will result in a more
systematic evaluation of resource management actions undertaken at military
installations. This approach will be further enhanced to incorporate the
cost and economics of viable land management alternatives.</P>

<P>A small sample of the IDLAMS user interface is shown in the following
Java(TM) slideshow.</P>

<P><B>Results</B></P>

<P>The initial Dynamic Landscape Modeling System (DLMS) developed for Fort
Riley, Kansas is currently being field tested at the installation. The expanded,
more robust modeling/GIS approach (IDLAMS) is now under development at an
additional DoD site (Fort McCoy, Wisconsin). This will involve the development
of an oak savanna vegetation dynamics submodel (which will include a fire
modeling component), as well as continued development and refinement of
submodels which may include erosion/water quality, wildlife, cultural resources,
and past land uses. The choice of submodels will be evaluated and determined
through coordination with the Fort McCoy natural and cultural resource staff
as well as other installation personnel. The development of new submodels
for IDLAMS will be complimentary to various ongoing DoD efforts.</P>

<P>The project's scientific approach and the resulting IDLAMS system will
enable resource managers to quantify the effects of land management actions,
both spatially and over time. The project offers a planning framework and
a technology that will be transferred to installation site managers by providing
pertinent resource information and a set of computer tools linked to their
existing geographic information system (GIS).</P>

<P>IDLAMS was developed in the <A HREF="facilities.html">Energy Systems'
Spatial Analysis Laboratory</A>, one of several specialized GIS/remote sensing
labs supporting ANL programs.</P>

<P>Several texts and Microsoft PowerPOINT presentations are available describing
the IDLAMS project(s). These include a Users Manual, Programmers Manual,
and Installations Guide as well as technical reports and journal articles
describing various aspects of the scientific advancements made during the
course of the program. Additionally, there is a separate textbook that was
produced by the IDLAMS staff during the program.</P>

<P><B>Future Plans</B></P>

<P>Although the initial emphasis of the project has focused on military
installations, the technology currently under development can also be used
at DOE sites. Future enhancements of this dual-use technology could have
widespread application to help other federal and state agency resource managers
and planners meet the challenges of fulfilling land stewardship requirements,
balancing multiple management objectives, and supporting their primary mission
with increasingly limited conservation funding.</P>

<P>A recent IDLAMS/LMS workshop involved all major contributors and parties
interested in the future development of IDLAMSand LMS (Land Management System).
This workshop involved planning and strategy meetings as well as software
demonstration and training.</P>
