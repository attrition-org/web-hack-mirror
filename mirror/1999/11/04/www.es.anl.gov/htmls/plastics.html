<P><B>Problem/Opportunity</B></P>

<P>Traditionally, recycling of appliances has been driven by the value of
their scrap steel. In the last 15 years, however, the use of plastics in
appliance manufacturing has increased substantially, at the expense of metals.
To increase the recycling of obsolete appliances in the future, cost-effective
and environmentally acceptable technologies need to be developed to recover,
upgrade, and reuse plastics from discarded appliances. It is estimated that
more than 300 million pounds of high-value plastics could be recovered and
reused, resulting in a reduction of up to 90% in appliance-related solid
waste that would otherwise end up in landfills.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Approach</B></P>

<P>Through collaborative research with industry, Argonne National Laboratory
is developing a process for recovering valuable individual plastics from
the non-metallic fractions generated by appliance shredding operations.
Further, to enhance the market penetration of recycled plastic materials,
cost-effective methods for improving the performance of the recovered plastics
will be developed.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>An estimated 300 million pounds of plastics from obsolete
appliances could be recovered and reused.</B></P>

<P>The recovery process consists of granulating the non-metallic material,
which is generated by appliance shredding and disassembly operations, to
1/4-inch size. The granulated material is then processed via mechanical/physical
separation methods into several fractions: polyurethane foam and other light
materials; thermoplastics, which include high-density polystyrene (HIPS)
and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS); and a small fraction consisting
of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nylon and some metals. The thermoplastics fraction
is further separated via acid/solvent-assisted methods into two high-value
plastics: ABS and HIPS. The ABS materials recovered from appliances could
have a market value in the range of 40-70&cent;/lb.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Results</B></P>

<P>A laboratory-scale process for recovering ABS and HIPS plastics has been
demonstrated, and more than 100 pounds of high-purity ABS has been produced
and analyzed to determine its properties and upgrading needs. Tests conducted
on the properties of the recovered ABS indicate that this material has good
performance characteristics and could be recycled to high-value applications.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Future Plans</B></P>

<P>A demonstration plant is scheduled to be built in 1996 to evaluate the
overall economic and technical performance of this process. A major appliance
recycler has tentatively agreed to use one of its facilities for the demonstration
of this process. With industry collaboration, the market value of the recovered
plastics will be optimized by researching cost-effective strategies for
upgrading the properties of the materials.</P>
