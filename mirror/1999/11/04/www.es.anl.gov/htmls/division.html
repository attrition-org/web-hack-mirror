<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>

<p>It's a fact. As private R&amp;D funding decreases, more and more U.S. companies are
leveraging their research dollars by working with the nation's network of federally funded
laboratories.</p>

<p>Forget what you've heard in the past about working with government agencies. As the
nation's priorities have switched from developing weapons systems to ensuring economic
security, technology transfer has become a top priority for the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) and its laboratories and facilities. Increased U.S. technological competitiveness is
the destination. Effective working partnerships between industry and government are paving
the way.</p>

<p>At DOE's Argonne National Laboratory, the Energy Systems (ES) Division is strongly
committed to a revitalized national economic competitiveness. The Division's long history
of industrial partnerships provides a strong customer-focus for its research.
Cost-effective, practical solutions are developed to solve real problems and meet real
needs. Economic and market evaluations are key considerations, not afterthoughts.
Timeliness and responsiveness are the Division's operating characteristics.</p>

<p>ES scientists and engineers are experienced in tailoring research programs for a broad
base of industries, including the oil, natural gas, railroad, automotive, textile,
electric utility, primary and secondary metals, chemical, and pulp and paper industries.
Additionally, ES routinely &quot;teams&quot; with professional staff from other Argonne
divisions or other national labs and universities when additional capabilities or
expertise are needed to solve an industry problem.</p>

<p>The Division's unique technical resources, expertise, and facilities are focused on:</p>

<p>&nbsp;

<ul>
  <li>Developing tomorrow's manufacturing processes </li>
  <li>Controlling environmental impacts of industrial energy use </li>
  <li>Recovering valuable products from industrial waste </li>
  <li>Developing new feedstocks and products </li>
  <li>Reclaiming natural resources and restoring environmental quality </li>
  <li>Designing 21st century transportation </li>
</ul>

<p>This website provides a brief overview of the Energy Systems Division's research and
development efforts and capabilities. The Division is committed to partnering with
companies of all sizes in transferring its ideas, concepts, designs, expertise,
technologies and research results.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b>ES ORGANIZATION</b></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Energy Systems Division is organized into three Centers.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a HREF="CITS.html"><img SRC="../gifs/gold.citslogo.gif" WIDTH="287"
HEIGHT="129" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></a><br>
</p>

<p><b>The Center for Industrial Technology Systems</b> is strongly committed to developing
and transferring clean, efficient energy and industry-related environmental technologies
into the marketplace to benefit U.S. companies, the federal government, customers, and the
general public.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a HREF="CERS.html"><img SRC="../gifs/gold.cerslogo.gif" WIDTH="315"
HEIGHT="121" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></a><br>
</p>

<p><b>The Center for Environmental Restoration Systems</b> develops and performs research,
development, and demonstration programs to support the complete environmental restoration
process, from start to finish, addressing each of the three stages of the process, and to
transfer the knowledge and technologies obtained to sponsors and other potential users of
that information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a HREF="CTR.html"><img SRC="../gifs/gold.ctrlogo.gif" WIDTH="330"
HEIGHT="118" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></a><br>
</p>

<p><b>The Center for Transportation Research </b>conducts research to evaluate and develop
transportation technology, with emphasis on reducing petroleum-fuel requirements, costs,
and environmental consequences of transportation systems.</p>

<p><br>
A number of specialized sections/teams make up each center (see Organization Chart). Each
has developed a particular core of expertise that enables it to perform state-of-the-art
research and development in a given area. The sections/teams work together on specific
projects, enabling the Division to conduct a broad range of energy and environmental
research programs. Additionally, ES routinely teams with professional staff from other
Argonne divisions or other national laboratories and universities when additional
capabilities or expertise are needed to solve research problems.</p>
