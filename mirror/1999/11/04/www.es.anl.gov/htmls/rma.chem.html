<P><B>Problem/Opportunity</B></P>

<P>Soils contaminated by chemical warfare agents pose a unique remediation
problem for military installations. At Rocky Mountain Arsenal, near Denver,
chemical and incendiary munitions have been produced and dismantled since
the 1940s. The chemical warfare agents most likely to be encountered at
the Arsenal are the blister agents, mustard and lewisite, and the nerve
agents, GB and VX. Success in identifying effective remediation technologies
will pave the way for full-scale treatment of the Arsenal's agent-contaminated
soil. Technologies that Argonne National Laboratory identifies as promising
may also have applicability to other kinds of contamination problems.</P>

<P><B>Approach</B></P>

<P>Argonne, a pioneer in studying the problem of agent-contaminated soils,
is evaluating different treatment technologies for treating such soils at
Rocky Mountain Arsenal.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Argonne is helping Rocky Mountain Arsenal choose the
most appropiate<BR>
remediation path for treating soils contaminated by chemical warfare agents.</B></P>

<P>The laboratory work, which will be performed on simulants to the agent,
has two phases. The first is a small-scale screening of the technologies,
using small samples (1 to 20 grams). Experiments are conducted over a wide
range of values to establish operational parameters. Findings will help
identify a narrower set of values to be tested during the second phase.
The second phase features bench-scale feasibility tests using larger (1-kilogram)
soil samples, which will provide better insight into the mechanisms of handling
large soil volumes.</P>

<P>Argonne is pursuing two cleanup technologies: thermal desorption and
solvent washing. Thermal desorption involves the removal of contaminants
that have adhered to the soil matrix (adsorption) or are held in voids between
particles (absorption). Solvent washing extracts compounds by dissolving
them in a fluid. Because the agents in question are highly toxic, more benign
compounds with similar chemical properties are used to &quot;spike&quot;
test soils in the laboratory.</P>

<P>In thermal desorption, treated soil and off-gases will be analyzed for
the simulated agent and expected degradation products. Later, in Phase Two,
1-kilogram soil samples will be treated in an indirectly heated, batch,
rotary-kiln desorption unit.</P>

<P>Triethylamine is currently being studied for solvent washing. Laboratory
screening will test for triethylamine's solubility with target compounds,
maximum extractability, and removal efficiency.</P>

<P><B>Results</B></P>

<P>Preliminary to laboratory experiments, Argonne conducted an extensive
literature review on agent chemistry, toxicology, decontamination, potential
treatment technologies, and applicable laws and regulations. A database
of 300 entries was compiled. Using the findings from the literature search,
Argonne conducted an evaluation of 26 in-situ and ex-situ technologies.
Each technology was screened for cost-effectiveness, implementation potential,
and decontamination effectiveness. From these paper studies, Argonne then
chose its two candidate technologies to test for feasibility at the laboratory
scale: thermal desorption and solvent washing.</P>

<P>Soil spiking, analytical development, and preliminary screening are progressing.
There are no data to report as yet.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Future Plans</B></P>

<P>Both solvent washing and thermal desorption have been tested on pesticide-contaminated
soils at Rocky Mountain Arsenal. One of the goals is to use either process
to treat pesticide- and agent-contaminated soil simultaneously.</P>

<P>If the experimental program has positive results, commercial vendors
will be screened by Argonne and invited to demonstrate their processes with
full-scale prototypes. A final evaluation will be prepared for each vendor
process, including projected costs. Argonne expects to continue as an unbiased,
expert consultant that can screen potential treatments for specific contaminated
sites and assist in the testing, evaluation, and selection of appropriate
vendors to provide full-scale remediation.</P>
