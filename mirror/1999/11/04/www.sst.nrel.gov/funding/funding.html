<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First-Principles band structure, total energy, and statistical 
mechanical methods are used to predict electronic and structural properties of 
energy-related semiconductor superlattices, surfaces, alloys and nanostructures, 
emphasizing chemical trends and properties of new, energy-related materials.  
Current work includes: (1) prediction of optical and dielectric properties of 
semiconductor quantum dots, wires, and films including configuration interactions 
(CdSe, GaAs, InP); (2) first-principles prediction of alloy thermodynamic 
quantities (e.g., phase-diagrams) for bulk semiconductors and metallic alloys, 
e.g., CuAu, CuAg, NiAu, AgAu, PdV, CuPd; (3) calculation of electronic properties 
of novel nitride alloys; and, (4) prediction of properties of unusual ternary 
materials, e.g., ordered vacancy compounds.  Theoretical tools include (a) 
the total energy non-local pseudopotential method and full-potential linearized 
augmented plane wave (LAPW) method, (b) the cluster expansion (&quot;LEGO&quot;) 
approach to the Ising program, applied to binary and pseudobinary phase diagrams, 
and (c) Monte-Carlo and simulated-annealing calculations of Ising models derived 
from first-principles.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This project uses a novel method for atomic-scale engineering of 
semiconductors, leading to advances in understanding and their improvement.  It 
consists of three linked segments: (a) preparation by MBE and MOCVD of State-of-the 
Art GaInAs and GaInAsP alloys surfaces; (b) use of the novel atomic processing 
microscope (APM) to image, process (including atom removal and placement) and 
characterize these semiconductors in the same nanoscale spatial resolutions; 
and, (c) use of modern electronic structure theory (pseudopotential total energy 
calculations) to predict the properties of semiconductor surfaces before and 
after atomic-scale engineering takes place.  The program is directed toward the 
semiconductors GaInAs and GaInAsP, that have applications to solid state and energy 
technologies, namely thermophotovoltaics.  These atomic scale investigations involve 
the manipulation of atoms in order to study the fundamental defect properties that 
limit both material properties and device III-V materials, and provides fundamental 
information of the nature of defects, their electro-optical properties, the ability 
to electronically heal them with intrinsic and extrinsic atomic species, and further 
the frontiers of materials science with these novel approaches to investigating 
material limitations.  This project links events on the atomic scale to the current 
understanding of semiconductor surface properties.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a joint project between NREL and Sandia National 
Laboratories involving the study of spontaneous composition modulation in 
III-V semiconductor alloys.  The main efforts in this program are: (1) MBE 
growth of III-V ternary alloys and short period superlattices such as InAs/A1As,
 InAs/GaAs, InP/GaP, which exhibit composition modulation (Sandia); (2) electron 
microscopy, electron diffraction, x-ray, and atomic force microscopy studies of 
spontaneously compositionally modulated structures (Sandia and NREL); (3) 
polarized photoluminescence, ellipsometry, excitation spectroscopy, differential 
absorption, modulated reflectance, time resolved photoluminescence, and 
magnetoluminescence studies on spontaneously composition modulated structures; 
and, (4) theoretical studies on the electronic properties of compositionally 
modulated alloys - including large-supercell pseudopotential calculations, 
exploring the way that the composition modulation wavelength, amplitude and 
direction affects the material properties of otherwise random GaInAs, A1InAs 
and GaInP alloys (NREL).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Doping semiconductors and wide-band-gap materials are essential 
for device applications in clean affordable energy generation and in improved energy 
efficiency, thus vital for our nation’s long-term Carbon management program, as well 
as for other energy programs.  Yet, there are strong doping bottlenecks that may 
severely restrict potential applications of semiconductors, especially in wide-band-gap 
materials where bipolar doping is impossible.  Recent rapid progress in semiconductor 
research has reached a point where these doping limitations must be overcome in order 
to tune semiconductors for precisely required properties.  Here, we study what causes 
the doping bottlenecks by first principles total energy calculations.  We base our 
studies on a set of recent, novel developments regarding the doping limitations: the 
&quot;doping limit rule&quot; distilled from both phenomenological studies and from 
first-principles calculations.  The doping bottlenecks are identified in this project 
as due mainly to the formation of intrinsic defects whose formation enthalpies depend 
on the Fermi energy, and thus always act to negate the effect of doping.  We test 
systematically the various existing microscopic defect models and develop new models 
to understand the physics of doping.  A number of new strategies for overcoming the 
doping bottlenecks are also studied.</P>
