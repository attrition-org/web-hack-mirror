<h1>NREL's Solid State Theory Group:<br> An Overview</h1>

<p align="left">The <a href="index.html">Solid State Theory (SST) Group</a> at 
<a href="http://nrel.gov">NREL</a> was established in 1978 under
the direction of Alex Zunger. The group consists of four regular staff plus anywhere from
five to eight post docs, research associates and visiting scientists. This group has
hosted and trained 31 post doctoral fellows (visit our web page entitled

and published over 300 papers in refereed journals (search our publications at
our web page entitled <a href="publications/publications.html">&quot;Publications
by Subject&quot;</a>) including <a href="publications/physrev.html">over than 40 in 
<em>Physical Review Letters</em> and almost 50 in <em>Rapid Communications</em></a>,
and delivered over 80 invited talks at major conferences
around the world (including 7 at <a href="publications/aps_talks.pdf">APS March 
Meetings</a>). The SST Group's main areas of
research include (but are not limited to): </p>

<ul>
  <li>Theory of Photovoltaic Semiconductors</li>
  <li>Statistical &amp; Electronic Theory of Metal and Semiconductor Alloys</li>
  <li>Semiconductor Nanostructures</li>
  <li>Computational Methods in First-Principles Theories&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
