<p>In order to determine the structural properties of defects on semiconductor 
surfaces using STM, it is crucial to properly interpret the STM 
images using, for example, state-of-art first principles calculations. 
The case considered here in the above figures (click on small figures
above to see full-size versions) 
is As vacancies on the GaAs(110) surface. 
STM images were 
generated using ab-initio wavefunctions and supercells, which probe 
the isosurface of the wavefunctions squared over a given energy window. The 
two figures here were calculated with a negative sample bias of about 2 eV to
reveal states associated with surface As atoms. They show, on the appearance, 
that surface As atoms near the vacancy are displaced towards the underlying 
bulk. In calculations with large enough surface supercells (see the 2nd figure),
significant As displacements in the STM images due to As vacancy were found 
while in fact the vacancy causes little As atomic motion. Discrepancies between
the actual atomic positions and those inferred from the STM images for Ga atoms
are even more pronounced.  A detailed analysis explaining this paradox is the 
subject of the reference below.</p>
