<h1>Quantum-Mechanical Design of Metal Alloys</h1>

<img SRC="cs.gif" height=287 width=265 align=RIGHT>

<p>Metal alloys (e.g., aluminum- and magnesium-based) have
great promise to reduce the weight of cars and light trucks without compromising
safety. However, much basic science is not yet understood about e.g. Al-alloys,
leading alloy designers often to simply "guess" at the parameters to be
used in microstructural models. Thus, the role of basic energetic and thermodynamic
data in designing metal alloys is crucial towards their application. Researchers
working in NREL’s Solid State Theory Group have developed computational
techniques for applying highly-accurate "state-of-the-art" first-principles
(i.e., completely quantum-mechanical, parameter-free) computational approaches
to obtaining thermodynamic properties of alloys. These calculations will
play a central role in predicting a new class of modern metal alloys, designed
on computers rather than in laboratories.</p>
<p>First-principles quantum-mechanical calculations are computationally
expensive; thus, even on today’s fastest computers, the system size which
can be simulated by first-principles approaches are limited by computational
resources, and thus some "scaling up" of length scales is necessary to
treat thermodynamic alloy problems. One method for this scaling up which
is currently utilized in NREL’s Solid State Theory Group is in mapping
accurate first-principles data onto simpler energy functionals which can
then be used on a much larger length scale. The method is known as LEGO,
or "<i>Linear Expansion in Geometric Objects</i>". Examples of this type
of approach are in precipitation hardening in Al-Cu and Al-Zn alloys: Like
most pure metals, aluminum is relatively weak, and therefore need to be
strengthened via alloying additions. In precipitation hardening, common
in Al-alloys, a small amount of a solute element is added to Al at high
temperatures, and then the alloy is quenched down in temperature past the
solubility limit of the alloying element. Thus, the solute element begins
to precipitate out of the Al matrix, and these precipitates act to pin
dislocations, and hence improve mechanical strength. However, without understanding
the structure and stability of the precipitated phase, alloy designers
cannot fully understand the strengthening mechanism. NREL researchers have
predicted the thermodynamic stability and atomic-scale structure of Cu
precipitates embedded in an Al matrix. The precipitation is determined
by a combination of strain and interfacial energies, and an example of
calculated strain energies for Cu embedded in Al is shown in Fig. 1. By
using both strain and interfacial in thermodynamic Monte Carlo simulations,
one can <i>predict</i> the complete atomic-scale structure of precipitates
in Al. An exampleof this kind of hybrid "first-principles/scale up" approach
is shown in Fig. 2, which shows the atomic-scale structure of an ordered
Cu precipitate in a dilute Al-Cu alloy.</p>

<p>In the case of Al-Zn, our model allows for the first time
a prediction of the observed size- and temperature dependence of precipitates
in this alloy system. These precipitates consist only of Zn atoms. Examples
of precipitates are visible in Fig. 3: In agreement with experimental studies,
the precipitates change from a nearly spherical to a more hexagonal/ellipsoidal
shape with decreasing temperature and increasing size.</p>

<p>The thermodynamic calculation was performed for a system
of more than 200,000 atoms, extending to length scales approaching 200&nbsp;&Aring;
approximately scaling the length scale of the first-principles calculations
by a factor of 20-50. With further improvements, length scales of 1000&nbsp;&Aring;
are in sight, thus leading to the possibility of microstructural modeling
with completely atomistic approaches.</p>
