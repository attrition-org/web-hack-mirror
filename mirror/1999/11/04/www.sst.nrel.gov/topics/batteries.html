<h1>Quantum-Mechanical Search for
Advanced Li-ion Battery Materials</h1>

<p>Advanced batteries are a growing
$40-billion-a-year business which substantially impacts the areas
of energy <img src="../images/licoo.gif" align="right" hspace="0"
width="233" height="228">storage, energy
efficiency, and advanced vehicles. Lightweight rechargeable
Li-ion batteries are an attractive long-term technology that
offers the promise of higherenergy densities than are currently
available. The performance of these batteries is significantly
impacted by the properties of the <i>cathode materials</i>, such
as the intensively studied LiCoO<sub>2</sub> oxide. </p>

<p>LiCoO<sub>2</sub> forms (among other structures
&#150; see below) a layered structure in which the Li and Co
cations sit in the octahedral sites of a nearly ideal fcc
sublattice of oxygen atoms (Fig. 1). Other synthesized forms of
LiCoO<sub>2</sub> also involve this octahedral sublattice of
cations in the close-packed oxygen network, but with differing
cation arrangements. Upon charging the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> battery
cathode, Li is deintercalated out of these structures, leaving
behind vacancies (denoted *) which can be positioned in different lattice
locations, forming a delithiated Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>
phase. Hence, there are three types of ordering problems which
are of interest in this material: (i) Li/Co ordering in LiCoO<sub>2</sub>
(<i>x</i>=1) leads to the different observed ordered phases and
also to disordered Li/Co (rocksalt) at high temperature. (ii)
Similarly, */Co ordering in the completely deintercalated * CoO<sub>2</sub>
(<i>x</i>=0) is also of interest. (iii) The vacancies left behind
by Li extraction can form ordered vacancy compounds in partially
deintercalated Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>, leading to a */Li ordering
problem for intermediate compositions 0&lt;<i>x</i>&lt;1. We
refer to the first two of these ordering problems as <i>cation
ordering</i> since they occur at fixed composition (either fully
intercalated or deintercalated) and deal with the positions of
the cations. The third type of ordering we call <i>intercalation
ordering</i> since it deals with a fixed CoO<sub>2</sub>
framework and the ordering may occur upon intercalation or
deintercalation of Li as a function of composition.</p>

<p>In a recent series of papers [1-3], we have
developed a first-principles theoretical method for treating both
cation and intercalation ordering in these battery cathode
materials. The approach also allows one to predict the voltages
of various ordered and disordered Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>
cells, and hence to examine theoretically the electrochemical
properties of battery cells from a quantum-mechanical approach.
The first-principles nature of the method not only allows for a
detailed understanding of the underlying physics of the
intercalation processes, but also allows one to reliably
investigate properties of as-yet-unsynthesized materials, and
hence make predictions about new materials. The use of such a
computational approach in Li battery design without the need for
experimental input should greatly accelerate the discovery of new
classes of battery materials.</p>

<h2>Prediction of Battery Voltages and
&quot;Ordered Vacancy Compounds&quot; from First-Principles</h2>

<p>In intercalation systems such as Li in
graphite, hydrogen in metals, and alkali-metals in transition
metal dichalcogenides, the ``guest'' atom occupies certain
``host'' sites preferentially at low temperatures while others
remain empty. Due to this specificity of the interactions between
the guest atoms and the intercalation lattice sites, a wide
variety of intercalated structures can form, including ``ordered
vacancy compounds''. Ordered vacancy compounds of intercalated Li
atoms have been observed in several layered lithium-transition
metal dichalcogenides such as Li<sub>x</sub>TiS<sub>2</sub>, Li<sub>x</sub>TaS<sub>2</sub>,
and Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>. Above a critical temperature,
these long-range ordered structures undergo an order-disorder
transition into a phase where the vacancies are distributed in a
disordered fashion on the intercalation sites. Vacancy ordering
in Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub> occurs on the Li sublattice
which forms close-packed (111) planes yielding a two-dimensional
triangular lattice. These Li-vacancy intercalation planes are
stacked along &lt;111&gt; in a rhombohedral fashion (ABC). To
study the intercalation ordering in Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>,
we use a cluster expansion approach: LAPW total energies are
computed for several (16) fully-relaxed ordered vacancy compounds
in Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>, formed by removing Li atoms
from the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> compound for various compositions and
arrangements of vacancies. These first-principles energies are
then mapped onto a cluster expansion, i.e., an Ising-like
Hamiltonian, which contains extended-range pair, triplet, and
quadruplet interactions between the substitutional units of the
ordering problem (in this case, Li and ?). This cluster expansion
is sufficiently accurate to predict the energies of various
arrangements of vacancies, but sufficiently simple to evaluate
that cells of 100,000 atoms (or more) may be quite easily
calculated, and the combination of the cluster expansion with
Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations affords the
possibility of studying finite temperature properties.</p>

<p>For a Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>/Li cell at
temperature <i>T</i>, the voltage <i>V(x)</i> as a function of Li
composition is given by the Li chemical potential difference
between cathode (Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>) and anode (Li
metal):</p>

<p align="center" class="center">-eV(x,T) = <font
face="Symbol">m</font><sub>Li</sub>(Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>,<i>T</i>)-
<font face="Symbol">m</font><sub>Li</sub>(Li
metal,<i>T</i>) (1)</p>

<p>Using a static, bulk description, the chemical
potential of Li metal is a constant reference energy and is
independent of <i>T</i>. Thus, computing the voltage of Eq. (1)
amounts to computing the chemical potential 
<font face="Symbol">m</font><sub>Li</sub>(Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>,<i>T</i>)
relative to the reference of Li metal. We have computed this
chemical potential as a function of Li content and temperature
from grand canonical (i.e., fixed chemical potential) Monte Carlo
simulations of a Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub> cluster expansion
at finite <i>T</i>. [3] This provides a completely
parameter-free, first-principles prediction of the Li
intercalation voltage of the Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>/Li
cell as a function of Li content. The predicted intercalation
voltage profiles for zero- and finite temperatures are shown in
Fig. 2. The first-principles calculations of electrochemical
voltage agree well with measured data: Measured voltage profiles
show an average voltage of around 4.0-4.2 V, while our
first-principles predictions show an average of 3.8 V.</p>

<p>The voltage profiles also contain information
about the phase stability of the ordered vacancy compounds:
Two-phase regions, defined in terms of free energies <i>vs</i>. <i>x</i>
by tie-lines connecting the two phases, correspond to plateaus in
the voltage profiles. Likewise, the voltage drops are associated
with single phase, ordered regions. As the temperature is
increased, drops become more rounded and disappear at
order-disorder transitions. The voltage profile of the solid
solution phase is completely smooth with no discontinuous voltage
drops. By carefully examining the voltage profiles as a function
of composition, the entire voltage-temperature phase diagram may
be mapped out (Fig. 3). From this predicted phase diagram, we see
that a large number of ordered vacancy compounds are stable at
low temperature, however, as the temperature is raised, many of
these phases undergo order-disorder reactions, and thus do not
survive to room temperature. At 300 K, we predict that three
ordered vacancy phases should remain stable: The predicted
&quot;2x1&quot; phase has been observed in electrochemical and
x-ray diffraction experiments, while the two <font
face="Symbol">Ö</font>3x<font
face="Symbol"> Ö</font>3 phases are
predictions awaiting experimental verification.</p>

<h2>Charge Redistribution and Electronic
Stability with Respect to Li Removal in Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub></h2>

<p>Our calculations also provide insight into the
remarkable stability of this material to Li-vacancies: The
stoichiometric ordered layered LiCoO<sub>2</sub> compound is an
insulator in LDA, but Li moves the Fermi level into the valence
band, turning the system (in LDA) to a metal. The classic
inorganic-chemistry view of this reaction is that the Co ion
absorbs the charge change: it changes its oxidation state from Co<sup>3+</sup>
in LiCoO<sub>2</sub> to Co<sup>4+</sup> in * CoO<sub>2</sub>.
Considering the large (Mott-Hubbard) Coulomb energy of an
unhybridized transition metal ion, such a change in oxidation
state would be accompanied by substantial modification of the
energy level structure of LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, which is not
observed in our self-consistent calculations. Instead, we find
that the charge enclosed around the Co site is surprisingly
constant (7.36<font face="Symbol">±</font>0.04 valence 
electrons inside a radius of 1.06Å) for
all configurations, as the Li content is reduced from <i>x</i>=1
to <i>x</i>=0. Figure 4 shows the charge rearrangements due to
complete [<font face="Symbol">r</font>(LiCoO<sub>2</sub>)-<font 
face="Symbol">r</font>(* CoO<sub>2</sub>)] and partial [<font 
face="Symbol">r</font>(Li<sub>0.5</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>)-<font
face="Symbol"> r</font>(* CoO<sub>2</sub>)]
Li removal, assuming the same lattice parameters and atomic
positions (those of relaxed LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) for all
structures. The calculated charge density demonstrates that as
electronic charge is removed from the compound (via Li
extraction), the oxygen-cobalt hybridization changes, so as to
maintain a nearly constant charge (hence, nearly unchanged energy
levels) around the Co site. This &quot;self-regulating
response&quot; (minimizing the effect of external perturbations
via rehybridization) is characteristic of systems having
localized <i>d</i> states that communicate with a covalent
manifold, e.g., transition-atom impurities in semiconductors. It
explains in such systems why the <i>d</i>-like energy levels do
not shift significantly in response to large nominal changes in
charge, and thus at least partly explains the &quot;defect
tolerance&quot; of these structures over a large range of Li
concentrations.</p>

<h2>Cation ordering: Layered <i>vs</i>.
Cubic Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub></h2>

<p>The material LiCoO<sub>2</sub> (<i>x</i>=1) has
been synthesized in two ordered forms: The commonly observed
layered form (Fig. 1) discussed above, and a cubic form which has
been produced by solution growth at low temperatures. The layered
and cubic forms are extremely similar in terms of cation
coordination sequence: Pair and three-body correlations are
equivalent, with the first difference between the two occurring
at the four-body correlation. Thus, one would expect the two
forms of LiCoO<sub>2</sub> to exhibit similar energies and
electrochemical potentials. However, electrochemical properties
of the two compounds are very different: The cubic phase has a
nearly flat low voltage plateau at 3.6 V, (for 0.5&lt; x &lt; 1) which
contrasts with the high voltage profile of the layered phase
which takes place near (or above) 4 V and has many voltage drops
and plateaus. This distinction is initially difficult to
understand given the structural similarity between the two, and
the expected similar stability. By performing total energy
calculations of these two parent structures and deintercalated
products of them, we have found [2] the origin of the
electrochemical differences between these two phases: Upon
removal of Li from the cubic phase, the Li atoms move from their
original octahedral positions to energetically favored
tetrahedral sites and form the low-energy normal spinel compound,
LiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The low energy of this spinel
compound divides the voltage of the cubic phase into a low
voltage plateau (for 0.5 &lt x &lt; 1) and a high voltage region (for 0.0
&lt; x &lt; 0.5). Although
no experiments have succeeded in deintercalating the LiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4
</sub>spinel, our calculations demonstrate that Li extraction
from this material should occur near 5V, thus providing a
theoretical prediction of an as-yet-unsynthesized high voltage
cathode material. Experiments to form and delithiate this spinel
phase are currently underway. This prediction provides a clear
example of how this first-principles approach should aid in the
discovery of new and better battery materials while at the same
time, elucidate the basic physics behind the electronic and
structural processes of intercalation in these materials.</p>
