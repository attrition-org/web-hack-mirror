<h1>Solid State Theory of Photovoltaic Materials</h1>

<p>Semiconductor materials such as CuInSe<sub>2</sub>, CdS,
CdTe, and ZnO have been used widely in photovoltaic device
applications. For example, CuInSe<sub>2</sub> with a direct band
gap of 1.04 eV is a prototype member of the family of I-III-VI2
chalcopyrite semiconductors. It has shown great potential as a
low cost thin-film photovoltaic material, achieving 17%
efficiency in polycrystalline form by alloying it with CuGaSe<sub>2</sub>.
Unlike convensional binary semiconductors (e.g., GaAs or ZnSe),
CuInSe<sub>2</sub> appear to tolerate a large range of
anion-to-cation off-stoichiometry (i.e., samples with a few
percentage Cu-poor and/or In-poor stoichiometries are stable
and useful). CuInSe<sub>2</sub>
can be doped <em>p</em> and <em>n</em> type to a low-resistivity
level merely via introduction of <em>native</em> defects, without
extrinsic impurities. However, the doping mechanism and other
properties of CuInSe<sub>2</sub> are not
well understood at a fundamental level. It is crucial to understand these
properties to further improve the cell efficiency and reduce the
cost of solar energy. </p>

<p>The Solid State Theory Group at NREL has been a significant
component of the fundamental research of NREL's PV program. It is
the only systematic effort in applying modern condensed matter
theory to photovoltaics. Researchers in this Group
have pioneered theoretical research into the material properties
and electronic structures of chalcopyrite semiconductors,
providing early predictions for the beneficial effects of
Ga-additions into CuInSe<sub>2</sub>, and guidelines for analysis
of spectroscopic, transport and X-ray measurements on CuInSe<sub>2</sub>
including band offsets and alloying effects. These theoretical
predictions and understanding have helped significantly
experiments aimed at clarifying and assessing crucial PV
functions. </p>

<p>Recently, using first-principles self-consistent electronic
structure theory, the researchers at the Theory Group have
calculated defect formation energies and defect transition energy
levels in CuInSe<sub>2</sub>. Contrary to previously accepted
assumptions in the analysis of defects in CuInSe<sub>2</sub>,
they find that (i) it is much easier to form Cu vacancy in CuInSe<sub>2</sub>
than to form cation vacancies in II-VIs. (ii) Defect formation
energies vary considerably both with the Fermi energy and the
chemical potential of the atomic species, and (iii) Defect pairs
such as (2V<sub>Cu</sub>+In<sub>Cu</sub>) have a remarkably low
formation enthalpy. This explains the massive non-stoichiometry
of CuInSe<sub>2</sub> and the appearance of ordered defect
compounds (ODCs) (e.g., CuIn<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>5</sub> as ordered
array of 2V<sub>Cu</sub>+In<sub>Cu</sub> defect pairs inside
CuInSe<sub>2</sub>. The fact that CuInSe<sub>2</sub> has good
electrical properties despite this off-stoichiometry is explained
in terms of the mutual passivation of donor In<sub>Cu</sub> by
acceptor V<sub>Cu</sub>. </p>

<p>Other research includes studying defects in CdTe/CdS alloys and
interfaces, and studying band offsets between photovoltaic 
semiconductors.</p>
