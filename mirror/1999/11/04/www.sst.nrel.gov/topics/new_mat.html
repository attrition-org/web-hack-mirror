<h1>Computer-Aided Search for New Materials Using Quantum-Mechanics</h1>

<p>Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the spectacular success
that semiconductor-based high technology has had in the past 50
years is the tiny number of species (core materials) on which
these technologies are based. Even considering a broad range of
semiconductor devices&#151;transistor, computer chips, solid
state lasers, detectors, solar cells, light-emitting diodes,
etc.&#151;there are only about ten basic semiconductors (all
belonging to the same crystal type!), that enables these
strategic technologies. This is a strikingly narrow material
base, considering the number of core materials that enable other
technologies: e.g., the 10<sup>3&#150;</sup>10<sup>5</sup>
species used in metallurgy, polymer technologies, biotech, and
the pharmaceutical drug industry. Thus, it is entirely possible
that we are currently missing the crucial breakthrough material
for present-day and future electronic devices. But how is one to
search for new stable materials? Even if one considers only two
types of atoms, there are as many as 2**N crystal structures
possible on a lattice with N sites. Even for N=35, this equals
the number of stars in our galaxy! Theoretical physicists at the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado
have developed a new strategy that enables one, using fast
computers and concepts from Quantum Mechanics to search this
astronomic space of possibilities for the &quot;winning
combination&quot; of atoms producing novel, stable crystal
structures. This approach&#151;Linear Expansion in Geometric
Objects (LEGO)&#151;is based on the recognition that even complex
crystal structures can be viewed as a collection of simple
Geometric Objects such as pairs of atoms (dumbbells), triangles
of atoms, etc. By assigning to each Geometric Object an
(quantum-mechanical) energy value, one can rapidly scan hundreds
of thousands of candidate structures (obtained by different
assemblies of the Geometric Objects), looking for the one with
the lowest overall energy. This LEGO approach has already
predicted a number of previously unsuspected intermetallic
compounds, that were missed by the conventional approach of
trial-and-error. This could revolutionize the way in which novel
materials are sought.</p>
