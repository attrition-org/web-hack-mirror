<h1>The Folded Spectrum Method (FSM)</h1>

<p>The conventional approach to solving for the eigenstates of a Hamiltonian containing a
mean-field potential is to minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect
to the expansion coefficients of the wavefunction (such as plane-wave coefficients). The
first eigenstate obtained is then the lowest energy eigenstate of that Hamiltonian. To
find higher states, one needs to orthogonalise each wavefunction to all the previously
converged states. This orthogonalization process scales as N<sup>3</sup>, and therefore
only small systems (no. atoms &lt;100) can be studied. The central point of the folded
spectrum approach is that eigenfunctions of the standard Hamiltonian, H, are also
eigenfunctions of (H-Eref)2. This is illustrated in the figure below where the spectrum of
H has been folded at the reference energy Eref into the spectrum of (H-Eref)2. Now the
lowest eigenstate of the folded spectrum is the eigenstate with energy closest to Eref.
Hence, by placing Eref in the physically interesting range , one transforms an arbitrarily
high eigensolution into the lowest one, thus removing the need for the costly
orthogonalization step. For example, if one places Eref within the band gap the lowest
eigensolution of the folded Hamiltonian is either the valence band maximum or the
conduction band minimum. </p>

<p>The code proceeds to solve for these few interesting eigensolutions of the folded
Hamiltonian, by minimizing the expectation value of the folded Hamiltonian, with respect
to the plane-wave expansion coefficients of the wavefunctions. A conjugate gradient
algorithm is used to perform this minimization. </p>

<h2>Applications of the Folded Spectrum Method</h2>

<h3>FSM for Disordered Superlattices <a href="#ref">[10,11]</a></h3>

<p>Here we studied wavefunction localization in (AlAs)<sub>n</sub>(GaAs)<sub>m</sub>(AlAs)<sub>p</sub>...
superlattices, where the periods (n,m,p....) were random. We discovered that disordering
enhances the transition probabilities. </p>

Quantum Dots</a><a href="#ref1">[1,3,4,6]</a></h3>

<p>There has recently been considerable interest in the electronic,
optical, transport and structural properties of semiconductor quantum dots.&nbsp; This is
interest is due both to the rich, novel physical properties exhibited by these systems
(Coulomb Blockade, quantum confinement, exchange enhancement and shape dependent
spectroscopy) and because of their promise for applications such as lasers.&nbsp; We have
used our FSM code to study the near-edge states of GaAs<a href="#ref4">[4]</a>, InAs, InP<a
href="#ref1">[1,3]</a> and CdSe free standing quantum dots.&nbsp; These calculations have
enabled us to calculate band gaps<a href="#ref1">[1,3,4,6]</a>, transition probabilities<a
href="#ref1">[1,3]</a>, exchange splittings<a href="#ref4">[4]</a> and red shifts<a
href="#ref3">[3]</a> for these dots.<p>

<h3>FSM for Self Assembled Quantum Dots</h3>

<p>Self Assembled or &quot;Stranski-Krastonow&quot; (SK) dots offer the possibility of
using standard MBE and MOVPE techniques to manufacture high quality, dislocation free
quantum dots with a narrow (&lt;10%) size distributions. The most popular system used for
constructing such dots is InAs dots embedded within GaAs dots. The solid state theory
group is actively researching the properties of such dots. In particular we are interested
in the effects on the electronic structure of altering the size and shape of the embedded
InAs dots, or applying hydrostatic pressure to the system containing the dots. </p>

<p>This figure is taken from the front cover of the <a
href="http://www.mrs.org/publications/bulletin/1998/feb">February 1998 issue of the MRS
Bulletin</a>. It shows the electronic structure of a 45A high, 90A base, strained InAs
pyramidal quantum dot embedded within GaAs. The strain-modified potential offsets in a
(001) plane through the center of the pyramid are shown above the atomic structure. They
exhibit a well for both heavy holes and electrons. These are localized within the pyramid
and wetting layer as shown by the blue raised(lowered) triangle and ridge(trough)
respectively. </p>

<p>Isosurface plots of the 4 highest hole states and 4 lowest electron states, as obtained
from pseudopotential calculations are shown on the left and right. The lowest electron
state (CBM) is s-like, while the next 2 states (CBM+1 and CBM+2) are non-degenerate
p-like. From J. Kim, L.W. Wang, A.J. Williamson and A. Zunger (unpublished). See also the
article by A. Zunger in the MRS Bulletin. </p>

<h3>FSM for Comparison of Free Standing and Embedded Quantum Dots</h3>

<p>This figure shows the strain modified electron, heavy hole and light hole potential
offsets in the {010} plane through the center of a GaAs embedded (a) spherical InAs dot
with 42.2A diameter and (b) a pyramidal InAs dot with 30.3AA height and 60.6\AA base. The
scale bars show the maximum depth of the electron and hole wells in eV. The black lines
mark the approximate edges of the electron and hole wells.</p>

<p align="left">The effect of the above offsets is to only weekly localize electrons and
holes within the GaAs embedded quantum dots. This can be seen in the figure below which
clearly shows how electron and hole wavefunctions are strongly localized in free standing
InAs quantum dots, but only weakly localized in GaAs embedded quantum dots. For more
information, see the publication A.J. Williamson and Alex Zunger, &quot;<em>InAs quantum
dots: Predicted electronic structure of free-standing vs. GaAs embedded structures</em>&quot;.</p>

<h2>Parallel Version of Folded Spectrum Code</h2>

<p align="left">Andrew Canning(LBL), <a href="../personnel/williamson/williamson.html">Andrew
Williamson</a>(NREL) and L.W. Wang(NREL) have ported the Folded Spectrum code to work on
the Cray T3E at NERSC. There were two main parts of the parallelization process. (i)
Efficiently distributing the set of reciprocal lattice vectors across all the nodes so
that operations performed in reciprocal space, such as calculating the kinetic energy can
then be performed in parallel. (ii) Implementing Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) that work
in parallel so that the wavefunctions can be efficiently transformed between real and
reciprocal space. On all the systems we have studied the code demonstrated excellent
scaling with the number of processing elements used. This is illustrated in the figure
below, which shows the total wallclock time and the inverse of this time for a
nanostructure calculation. </p>

<p align="center" class="center"><img src="../../images/parallel.gif"
alt="Scaling of Parallel FSM Code" width="411" height="311"></p>

<p>The above system was stored on a real space grid of 480x480x240 and 20 line
minimizations of the conjugate gradient routine were used in the timing. We estimate that
the parallel FSM code performs at approximately 110-130Mflops per node on the T3E900.</p>
