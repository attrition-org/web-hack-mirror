<p>Solid state alloys at high temperatures often 
undergo a phase transition to a disordered arrangement of the
constituent atoms.  The arrangement is not random, however, but
may exhibit some degree of <i>short-range order</i>, i.e., the
excess probability of finding certain pairs of atoms relative
to random statistics.  For the first time, ``state-of-the-art''
first-principles calculations including the effects of atomic
displacements have been extended to high
temperatures, and the resulting short-range order predicted.
The short-range order has been predicted for a variety of 
transition metal and semiconductor alloys.  
The excess pair probabilities associated with
short-range order are also a physically measurable
effect, and we have compared our parameter-free calculations
with experimental measurements, finding excellent agreement. 
Our calculations have led to an increased understanding of
ordering properties in these alloys.</p>

<p> Many transition metal alloy systems are currently being considered
as a new class of materials for high-temperature applications.
In many cases these applications have been limited to date, however,
oftentimes due to a lack of fundamental understanding of the
materials properties.  Also, in many semiconductor alloys, the
degree or extent of ordering is not even known experimentally.
The current theoretical calculations demonstrate that ordering
processes in alloys may be understood and even predicted (without
reference to any experiment) on a fundamental, microscopic
level. The theoretical predictions are shown to be highly
accurate by comparing with experimental measurements for transition
metal alloys, for which an abundance of experimental data exists.
These calculational tools are not specific to transition metals,
however, thus opening the door to calculations of ordering in
the highly technologically important semiconductor alloys, where
there exists very little or no experimental data.</p>
