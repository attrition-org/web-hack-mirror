<p>The New York Institute for Special Education(NYISE) is a private, non-profit, non-sectarian educational facility with 
<a href="program.htm"><b>quality programs</b></a> for children who are blind or visually disabled, emotionally and learning disabled and pre-schoolers who 
are developmentally delayed. </p>
<p>The school was founded in 1831 as <b>The New York Institution for the Blind</b> as one of the first schools in the United States 
to provide an educational programs for children who were blind or visually impaired. Early in the twentieth century, the 
name was changed to <b>The New York Institute for the Education of the Blind</b> to emphasize the educational character of 
the school. A <a href="oritor.htm"><b>pictorial history</b></a> of the school and a collection of <a href="blind.htm"><b>disability links</b></a> are available at this site. </p>
<p>Today, our <a href="scherm.htm"><b>Schermerhorn Program</b></a> continues its rich tradition of educating children who are blind or visually impaired. 
We have also used this expertise to develop new programs to help children with other disabilities. </p>
<p>In the 1980's educators recognized the need to provide programs designed specifically for students with learning and 
emotional disabilities. In response to this need, the school established the <a href="vancleve.htm"><b>Van Cleve Program</b></a> for those children who 
could not be served in a traditional school setting. In 1986, the school's name was changed to <b>The New York Institute for 
Special Education</b> to better reflect this expanded focus and commitment to children with a variety of disabilities. In 1987, a 
program for developmentally delayed pre-schoolers was established called the <a href="readness.htm"><b>Readiness Program</b></a>. </p>

<p>Nearly 300 students from ages 3 to 21 now attend NYISE. The school 
offers the option of a day treatment program or a five day residential 
program. All <A HREF="../students/"><B>students</B></A> return home on weekends and holidays. An 
Individualized Education Plan is developed for each student. In 
addition, a full array of services is provided, which include 
counseling, <A HREF="../career/"><B>career guidance</B></A>, therapy, individual and team sports and adaptive and recreational activities. </p>

  of the University of the State of New York for and on behalf of the State Education 
  Department, and is accredited by the National Commission for the Accreditation 
  of Special Education Services. Please <a href="../mailform.htm"><b>sign our
