<ul><li><a href="scherm.htm"><b>The Schermerhorn Program</b></a><br>

The <a href="scherm.htm">Schermerhorn Program</a> recognizes our historic commitment to children who are blind and visually impaired. Many of these children, who range in age from 5 to 21 years, have a mild secondary disablity and need a specialized educational environment in order to be successful in school. Students are placed in either the day or five day residential program.
<p>
<li><a href="vancleve.htm"><b>The Van Cleve Program</b></a><br>
The children of the <a href="vancleve.htm">Van Cleve Program</a> have emotional or learning difficulties. The highly structured educational day and residential component includes specialized services such as counseling for the students and their families. Our goal is to reduce the behavioral and learning deficits of students by providing academic and social skills necessary to enter less restrictive programs.
<p>
<li><a href="readness.htm"><b>The Readiness Program</b></a><br>
The  <a href="readness.htm">Readiness Program</a> is a pre-school that helps children who are developmentally delayed from ages 3 to 5. They have disabilities that include speech impairment, mild orthopedic impairment, or a learning or emotional disability. By providing specialized instruction, intensive therapies and early intervention many are able to be mainstreamed or are placed in a least restrictive educational environment when they reach the age of five.
