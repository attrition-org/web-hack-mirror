The Schermerhorn Program offers diverse educational services to meet the needs of
children who are legally blind, from the ages of 5 to 21. Students participate in individually
designed academic and modified academic programs that emphasize independence. Many
of the students have mild secondary disabilities and need a specialized educational
environment in order to be successful in school. The school offers either a day program or
a five-day residential program.
<p>
Following a thorough psychological and educational evaluation, a multi-disciplinary team in
cooperation with the student's family, develops a comprehensive Individual Education Plan
(I.E.P.) to meet the student's education needs. Classroom instruction forms the core of the
student's program. Some students receive instruction which follows the New York State
Curricula leading to elementary and high school diplomas. Students can also take high
school level courses at the local public high school. Students not on grade level receive
remedial instruction and as they mature life skills training is provided. A student's program
may also include career education, training in activities of daily living, social skills,
nutrition, computer science and technology.
<p>
A vast array of special services support each student. When appropriate, speech therapy,
occupational therapy, physical therapy, orientation and mobility, art and  <A HREF="../music/index2.html"><B>music  therapy</B></A>  may be
scheduled. All students receive a full program of adaptive physical education. Counseling
and guidance services are available to all students and their families.
<p>
As an extension of our Career Educational Curriculum, students are given an opportunity
to develop job behaviors and job skills through prevocational activities and in the career
experience program. Activities include work in horticulture, on-campus coffee shop, an
on-campus practice store, and simulated workshops. The career experiences program
includes training and job experiences in a variety of jobs on the campus and, for advanced
students, in the community.
<p>
Once their education is completed the students move on to a variety of settings. This
includes college, other less restrictive special education and regular education programs,
vocational training, as well as gainful employment.
