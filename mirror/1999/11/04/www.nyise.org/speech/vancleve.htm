The Van Cleve Program accepts children with learning and emotional disabilities for four
years and nine months to eleven years of age. Children may remain in the program until
the age of thirteen. The goal of the program is to remediate the behavioral and learning
deficits of students by providing academic and social skills necessary to enter a less
restrictive program.
<p>
The program provides a highly structured educational day and five day residential setting,
including counseling services for both students and families. The program's philosophy lies
in the belief that students want to progress, learn and be successful. To assure their
success a supportive, structured setting is provided in which the students discover to be
valued and capable individuals.
<p>
A multi-disciplinary evaluation team provides a complete assessment of the child's
functioning levels.  A complete battery of educational tests are administered to access
skills and levels. A neuro-psychiatric, psychological, social history, medical and physical
movements evaluation is completed prior to the student's entry in the program. These
evaluations help formulate the student's Individual Educational Plan (I.E.P.), with goals
developed in the areas of academics, behavioral management, physical and social
development. 
<p>
All children are re-evaluated at specified intervals to access their progress and to ensure
continued appropriate planning. In addition to the educational curriculum, the students
also receive related services including art,  <A HREF="../music/index2.html"><B>music  therapy</B></A> , physical education and
computer instruction.
<p>
Upon completion of the Van Cleve Program students are placed in their next education
setting after meetings by their local Committee on Special Education. Students have
moved into the regular public school system, less restrictive educational setting and other
residential treatment facilities.
