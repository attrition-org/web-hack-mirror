          Christmas, <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; when all through the house <br>
          Not a creature was stirring, --not even a mouse; <br>
          The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.<br>
          The children were nestled all snug in their beds, <br>
          While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads; <br>
          And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, <br>
          <br>
          Had just settled down for a long winter's nap, <br>
          When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, <br>
          I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. <br>
          Away to the window I flew like a flash, <br>
          Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. <br>
          The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow <br>
          Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below, <br>
          When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, <br>
          But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer, <br>
          <br>
          With a little old driver, so lively and quick, <br>
          I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. <br>
          More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, <br>
          And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name; <br>
          "Now, DASHER! now, DANCER! now, PRANCER and VIXEN! <br>
          On, COMET! on CUPID! on, DONDER and BLITZEN! <br>
          To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! <br>
          Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!" <br>
          <br>
          As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, <br>
          When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky, <br>
          So up to the house-top the coursers they flew, <br>
          With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too. <br>
          And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof <br>
          The prancing and pawing of each little hoof. <br>
          As I drew in my hand, and was turning around, <br>
          Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. <br>
          He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, <br>
          And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; <br>
          A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, <br>
          And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. <br>
          <br>
          His eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry! <br>
          His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! <br>
          His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, <br>
          And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow; <br>
          The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, <br>
          And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath; <br>
          He had a broad face and a little round belly, <br>
          That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly. <br>
          <br>
          He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, <br>
          And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; <br>
          A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, <br>
          Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread; <br>
          He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, <br>
          And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, <br>
          And laying his finger aside of his nose, <br>
          And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose; <br>
          He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, <br>
          And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. <br>
          But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, <br>
          "HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT."</font></b></div>
