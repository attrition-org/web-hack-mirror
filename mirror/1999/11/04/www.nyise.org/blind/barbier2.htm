  <b>LOUIS BRAILLE</b> 
  <p> Quoted from: <b>Uniform Braille System</b> by William Henry Illingworth, 
    Esq. Headmaster of the Royal Blind Asylum and School, Edinburgh, Scotland. 
    Read at a London Conference of 1902. 
  <p> Louis Braille was born on 4th January, 1809, at Coupvray, near Paris. At 
    three years of age an accident deprived him of his sight, and in 1819 he was 
    sent to the Paris Blind School-which was originated by <a href="hauy.htm">Valentin 
    Hauy</a>. Here he made rapid progress in all his studies. He learned to read 
    by embossed Roman letter, which was exclusively used at the time and which 
    continued popular for fifty years in that country and our own, and is still 
    used in many schools in America. 
  <p> In 1826, now a promising organist in a Paris church, Braille was elected 
    Professor at the Institution. Both as pupil and teacher he spent most of his 
    leisure trying to find a system by which the blind could write in relief. 
  <p> One which had been invented by M. Barbier appeared the most promising. M. 
    Charles Barbier was an officer of Artillery, who, being rich and philanthropic, 
    was interested in the blind, and did what he could to promote their education. 
    In 1825, he suggested embossing by means of a point method, the character 
    containing 12 dots, 6 high and 2 wide, arranged in a rectangle The character 
    thus obtained was large and unwieldy, though capable of an almost unlimited 
    number of combinations. 
  <p> Louis Braille cut Barbier's character to two and thus produced his well-known 
    3 by 2. On this basis Braille was the first who devised a practical scheme 
    for printing and writing in tangible form, suitable to the tactile capacity 
    of all. This was in 1829.

  After some slight modification it reached its present form in 1834, and is the 
  system which has since borne his name. We do not find, however, nor does it 
  appear, that Louis Braille, in arranging his system, paid attention to any other 
  considerations than one, namely the methodical arrangement of the letters of 
  the alphabet. 
  <p> For my own part, I must candidly confess I have a strong leaning to the 
    '<a href="america2.htm">American Braille</a>' arrangement, root and branch--the 
    contractions, like the letters, being carefully and scientifically planned. 
    Nearly one half of the letters of the alphabet are the same as our own, so 
    that the labour of learning it by those conversant in English Braille would 
    be very small. 
  <p> The period 1825 to 1835 appears to have been a period of universal activity 
    in matters relating to embossed literature and printing. In Britain, we has 
    <a HREF="gall.htm">Gall, Alston, Moon, Fry, Frere, and Lucas,</a> all bringing 
    out their own peculiar types, and each having his own partisans. In America 
    there were Mr. Friedlander, Dr. Howe and others. 
  <p> About 1859 or 1860 the Braille system was introduced to America and was 
    taught with some success at the St. Louis School for the Blind. In 1868, the 
    British and Foreign Blind Association came into existence and having brought 
    Braille into this country, gave to it a powerful impetus by printing and disseminating 
    books in that type. 
  <p> It will be seen that both in England and France there was, even at so late 
    a date as 1878, considerable diversity of opinion as to claims of Braille 
    as the best method of reading and writing for the blind. 
  <p> In America the same thing occured. <a href="../text/wait.htm">William Bell 
    Wait</a>, of New York, inventor, or perhaps the perfector of New York Point 
    type, tells us ..."the merits of the Braille system were recognized chiefly 
    by a few blind persons who were engaged in teaching. It was proscribed as 
    being arbitrary on the ground that it was unlike the ordinary forms of letters." 
  <p> <i>Editor's Note: </i><br>
    New York Point was more widely used than anyone remembers. Mr. Wait advocated 
    NY Point as superior to both American Braille and <a HREF="britbrl2.htm">British 
    Braille</a>. According to Robert Irwin in his book &quot;<a href="irwin2.htm">As 
    I Saw It</a>&quot; (1955), this &quotwar of the dots&quot divided the schools 
    of the blind into two camps for until the issue was finally settled around 
    1916. One that used NY Point and another that advocated American Braille. 
    The war was lost by both sides because the British stood by the braille code 
    it was using. Ultimately, the wealth of code already available in the British 
    Empire and the desire for a unified English language code lead to the acceptance 
    of the Braille code we use today. <br>
