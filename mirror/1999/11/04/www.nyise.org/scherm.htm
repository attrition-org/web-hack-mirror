        <p> The Schermerhorn Program offers diverse educational services to meet 
          the needs of children who are legally blind, from the ages of 5 to 21. 
          Students participate in individually designed academic and modified 
          academic programs that emphasize independence. Many of the students 
          have mild secondary disabilities and need a specialized educational 
          environment in order to be successful in school. The school offers either 
          a day program or a five-day residential program. 
        <p> Following a thorough psychological and educational evaluation, a multi-disciplinary 
          team in cooperation with the student's family, develops a comprehensive 
          Individual Education Plan (I.E.P.) to meet the student's education needs. 
          Classroom instruction forms the core of the student's program. Some 
          students receive instruction which follows the New York State Curricula 
          leading to elementary and high school diplomas. Students can also take 
          high school level courses at the local public high school. Students 
          not on grade level receive remedial instruction and as they mature life 
          skills training is provided. A student's program may also include career 
          education, training in activities of daily living, social skills, nutrition, 
          computer science and technology. 
        <p> A vast array of special services support each student. When appropriate, 
          speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, orientation 
          and mobility, art and <A HREF="music/">music</A> may be scheduled. All 
          students receive a full program of adaptive physical education. Counseling 
          and guidance services are available to all students and their families. 
        <p> As an extension of our <a href="career/">Career Educational Curriculum</a>, 
          students are given an opportunity to develop job behaviors and job skills 
          through prevocational activities and in the career experience program. 
          Activities include work in horticulture, on-campus coffee shop, an on-campus 
          practice store, and simulated workshops. The career experiences program 
          includes training and job experiences in a variety of jobs on the campus 
          and, for advanced students, in the community. 
        <p> Once their education is completed the students move on to a variety 
          of settings. This includes college, other less restrictive special education 
          and regular education programs, vocational training, as well as gainful 
          employment.
