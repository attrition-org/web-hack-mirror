<br><font SIZE=+0>The <a HREF="scherm.htm">Schermerhorn Program</a> recognizes

our historic commitment to children who are blind and visually impaired.

Many of these children, who range in age from 5 to 21 years, have a mild

secondary disability and need a specialized educational environment in order

to be successful in school. Students are placed in either the day or five

day residential program. </font></li>

<br>

<font SIZE=+0>The children of the <a HREF="vancleve.htm">Van Cleve

Program</a> have emotional or learning difficulties. The highly structured

educational day and residential component includes specialized services

such as counseling for the students and their families. Our goal is to

reduce the behavioral and learning deficits of students by providing academic

and social skills necessary to enter less restrictive programs. </font></li>

<br><font SIZE=+0>The <a HREF="readness.htm">Readiness Program</a> is a

pre-school that helps children who are developmentally delayed from ages

3 to 5. They have disabilities that include speech impairment, mild orthopedic

impairment, or a learning or emotional disability. By providing specialized

instruction, intensive therapies and early intervention many are able to

be mainstreamed or are placed in a least restrictive educational environment

when they reach the age of five. </font></li>
