<br>
Sometimes in life there are pit falls, but you always have a friend to help you though it.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you make mistakes, but you always have a friend that won't judge you, and will
try there best to help you make sure you don't make the same mistake again.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you don't think you can do something, but you always have a friend that will
tell you that you can. And they will stick by you until you can do it.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you do something that you regret, but you always have a friend that will comfort
you, and help you understand that you shouldn't regret it, as we all do something in life
we regret, but we have to get past it, and move on, or at least understand that whatever
happened wasn't your fault.<br>
<br>
But sometimes you can't get past something and move on, but you always have a friend that
will try their best to help you move on, or if it was something that they know is going to
be hard to get over, then they will always be there for you.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you are sad and depressed, but you always have a friend that will make you feel
better, and try there hardest to cheer you up.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you are upset about something, but you always have a friend that will take your
mind off of it, and make you feel better.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you are mad, but you always have a friend that will make you understand. If your
mad at them they will try there best to make it up to you, and apologize. Or if your mad
at someone else, they will tell you to think it through the mind of the other person.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you will think your friend is too busy for you, when really all you have to do
is tell them you need to talk, and they will stop whatever there doing to talk to you.<br>
<br>
Sometimes your friend will move, but they will always keep in contact with you.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you will loose contact with your friend, but you and your friend will always try
to get a hold of each other, and you'll probably meet again when you need each other the
most.<br>
<br>
Sometimes your friend will die, but really the only way they can truly die, is if you let
them. Never forget about them, no matter how much it hurts, they will always be with you,
whether its in your heart, or in spirit.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you want to end your life, because you don't think its worth living, and
everyone would be better off if you were dead, but you always have a friend who will tell
you that they love you, and that your life is worth living, because if you do die, so will
a piece of them. And they would tell you that they would be better off dead if you weren't
around.<br>
<br>
Your friend will always guide you thought life's toughest problems... One way or another.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF"><u><strong>The Garden - PhantasmP</strong></u><br>
<br>
The garden was wet from the storm. The golden morning sunlight shines on the light green
leafs, drying them. The beautiful yellow, purple, and red flowers start to bloom. The air
starts to smell like spring again. Everything around you comes to life before your eyes.
As the dark storm clouds seem to be pushed away by the warmth of the sun. A rainbow
appears by the small patch of storm clouds. The birds start to sing, and the insects swarm
around the dampness in the shadows. I walk into the sunlight and feel the warmth of the
sun on my exposed skin. I look around and its almost like I realise for the first time
that everything if full of life, and just how important everything is, no matter how much
I dislike it, I now know to respect it. The Robin, The Fly, The Squrrel and all other
living creatures, animals or plants make this world what it is today, the world could be
an almost perfect place if humans never inhabited it. Then I wake up and look out the
window, almost expecting to see what I saw in my dreams, but I see the plants in the
horizion with tonns of smoke coming out, the yellow sky, the bare ground, and the sound's
of siruns. Then I relize just how much we have fucked up this world, and I go back to
sleep hoping to go back to my perfect garden.</font></p>

    non-profit, non-sectarian educational facility with <a href="program.htm"><b>quality
    programs</b></a> for children who are blind or visually disabled, emotionally and learning
    disabled and pre-schoolers who are developmentally delayed. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">The school was founded in 1831 as <b><i>The New York Institution for the
    Blind</i></b> as one of the first schools in the United States to provide an educational
    programs for children who were blind or visually impaired. Early in the twentieth century,
    the name was changed to <b><i>The New York Institute for the Education of the Blind</i></b>
    to emphasize the educational character of the school. A <a href="oritor.htm"><b>pictorial
    history</b></a> of the school and a major collection of disability links called the <a
    href="blind.htm"><b>Blindness Resource Center</b></a> are available at this site. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Today, our <a href="scherm.htm"><b>Schermerhorn Program</b></a>
    continues its rich tradition of educating children who are blind or visually impaired. We
    have also used this expertise to develop new programs to help children with other
    disabilities. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">In the 1980's educators recognized the need to provide programs designed
    specifically for students with learning and emotional disabilities. In response to this
    need, the school established the <a href="vancleve.htm"><b>Van Cleve Program</b></a> for
    those children who could not be served in a traditional school setting. In 1986, the
    school's name was changed to <b><i>The New York Institute for Special Education</i></b> to
    better reflect this expanded focus and commitment to children with a variety of
    disabilities. In 1987, a program for developmentally delayed pre-schoolers was established
    called the <a href="readness.htm"><b>Readiness Program</b></a>. .</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Nearly 300 students from ages 3 to 21 now attend NYISE. The school
    offers the option of a day treatment program or a five day residential program. All <a
    HREF="students/"><b>students</b></a> return home on weekends and holidays. An
    Individualized Education Plan is developed for each student. In addition, a full array of
    services is provided, which include counseling, <a HREF="career/"><b>career guidance</b></a>,
    therapy, individual and team sports and adaptive and recreational activities. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">The New York Institute for Special Education is chartered by the Board
    of Regents of the University of the State of New York for and on behalf of the State
    Education Department, and is accredited by the National Commission for the Accreditation
