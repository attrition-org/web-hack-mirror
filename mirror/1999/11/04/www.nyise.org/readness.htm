        <hr width="75%">
        <p> The Readiness Program is a special educational pre-school program 
          for children who are developmentally delayed and disabled from the ages 
          of three to five years. The goal of the program is to provide instruction 
          and early intervention services so that these children can be placed 
          in a mainstreamed or the least restrictive environment when they reach 
          the age of five. 
        <p> The children in the program have disabilities which may include speech 
          impairment, mild orthopedic impairment, a learning or mild emotional 
          disability. The children attend school five days a week for five hours 
          a day. Children are referred to the program by their Public School District 
          Committee on Pre-School Education. The school evaluates all referrals 
          and recommends appropriate services. 
        <p> Speech, physical, occupational and play therapies are in groups or 
          individually provided as mandated by a child's Individual Education 
          Plan. The High/Scope Curriculum is implemented with all classes, based 
          on the theory that children learn best by being actively involved in 
          activities of their choice. The curriculum provides for consistent daily 
          routines which include adult-supported play, gross motor activities, 
          lunch and nap. 
        <p> Children in the program are reviewed at least once a month by a team 
          of professionals. These reviews provide information on student growth 
          and development, as well as strategies for working with the child. 
        <p> Parents of children in the program are strongly encouraged to participate 
          in their child's classroom activities and to attend monthly parent training 
          sessions and meetings. Family support groups as well as individual meetings 
          with social workers are offered to all parents. 
        <p> In addition to the educational staff, a full array of professionals, 
          such as social workers, speech, occupational and physical therapists, 
          are an intricate part of the program. A nurse, from the Low Birthweight 
          Infant Follow-up Evaluation Clinic(L.I.F.E.), is available daily to 
          address minor medical needs of the children and concerns of the staff 
          and parents. Psychiatric and psychological consultants work with the 
          staff and families regarding behavioral and emotional needs. 
        <p> In recent years, the Readiness Program has had a dramatic impact on 
          the lives of pre- schoolers with developmental disabilities. Upon graduation, 
          almost 40% of the children move on to regular education classes in public 
          schools. .
