      <td width=80%> The Van Cleve Program accepts children with learning and 
        emotional disabilities for four years and nine months to eleven years 
        of age. Children may remain in the program until the age of thirteen. 
        The goal of the program is to remediate the behavioral and learning deficits 
        of students by providing academic and social skills necessary to enter 
        a less restrictive program. 
        <p> The program provides a highly structured educational day and five 
          day residential setting, including counseling services for both students 
          and families. The program's philosophy lies in the belief that students 
          want to progress, learn and be successful. To assure their success a 
          supportive, structured setting is provided in which the students discover 
          to be valued and capable individuals. 
        <p> A multi-disciplinary evaluation team provides a complete assessment 
          of the child's functioning levels. A complete battery of educational 
          tests are administered to access skills and levels. A neuro-psychiatric, 
          psychological, social history, medical and physical movements evaluation 
          is completed prior to the student's entry in the program. These evaluations 
          help formulate the student's Individual Educational Plan (I.E.P.), with 
          goals developed in the areas of academics, behavioral management, physical 
          and social development. 
        <p> All children are re-evaluated at specified intervals to access their 
          progress and to ensure continued appropriate planning. In addition to 
          the educational curriculum, the students also receive related services 
          including art, <A HREF="music/">music therapy</A> , physical education 
          and computer instruction. 
        <p> Upon completion of the Van Cleve Program students are placed in their 
          next education setting after meetings by their local Committee on Special 
          Education. Students have moved into the regular public school system, 
          less restrictive educational setting and other residential treatment 
          facilities.
