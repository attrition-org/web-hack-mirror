<H1>Introduction</H1>
<H3>The Exposition is an English rendering of Mahfum-ul-Quran (written in Urdu) by Late Allama Ghulam Ahmed Parwez. The work was carried out by Idare-Tulu-e-Islam in Lahore (Pakistan). Allama Parwez was an intense researcher of The Quran and consequently wrote much including Lughat-ul-Quran. Most of his work though is in Urdu. Among his works in English is a book entitled "Islam:A Challenge to Religion" . Anyone interested in knowing more about what the Allama has written can contact me through my E-Mail address: 100543.3346@compuserve.com. I hope you all find The Exposition enlightening.</H3>
