This page has been designed to provide a lot of useful islamic information found on different sites and in different books. The aim is to make the muslims aware of their duties and the current crisis they find themselves in.<br>
Everywhere we turn we find muslims being persecuted, and where they're not, there the muslims are dealing with themselves most unjustly by neglecting their duties and not realising what their purpose in this life is. Muslims seem to have got too absorbed in the pleasures and distractions this world has to offer. They would go miles and travel for hours to go to a night club, a concert, a game etc., but they will not walk a few feet on the right path.<br>
Why ? Is something missing ? Is the belief in day of judgement not as strong as it ought to be ? Is their love for Allah(swt) not as great as their love for their players and their singers etc.? <br>
And then there are those who have taken the word life out of the phrase <font color=green>"Islam : Complete Way of Life"</font> and have made it <font color=green>"Islam : Complete set of Rituals"</font>, ignoring what happens around them, what happens in the market place, what happens in their jobs, what happens all aound the world, how many muslims get persecuted every day, how many muslim children loose Islam in schools, colleges and universities every day because of continous media attacks and public trends set by the Kuffar.<br>
<I>Inshallah , I hope you find information here in this page which answers different questions you might have and help you in your path to becoming a true muslim, who only fears Allah(swt), and all his actions are done to please Allah(swt).</I></font><P>
