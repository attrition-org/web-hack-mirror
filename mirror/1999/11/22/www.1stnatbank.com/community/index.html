    <td>The Bank has four vending trailers it loans to non-profit organizations within our
    South Miami-Dade market area. The trailers are approximately 6 feet by 12 feet and are
    wired for electricity and include amenities such as ice storage, soda dispensers,
    shelving, etc. They are provided free of charge, but a $40 cleaning fee is required. These
    are very popular items -- particularly on holidays -- and advanced bookings are made on a
    first come, first served basis. Call the Homestead Women's Club at 305-248-8001 to make a
    reservation.</td>

    <td>We also loan out two large, enclosed BBQ grills which are designed to smoke meats of
    all sorts. They have a large firebox for charcoal and wood at one end and the heat and
    smoke from the fire are drawn across the meat in a very slow cooking process. You should
    figure on a minimum of three hours to cook most meat. These &quot;smokers&quot; are
    available to non-profit groups active in the bank's South Dade market area. The use of the
    grills is free, but there is a $25 cleaning fee for those who choose not to clean the
    grills before returning them. We also have a large, trailer mounted open grill available.
    Call Lila Bostic at 305-242-8611 for information or to make a reservation.</td>
