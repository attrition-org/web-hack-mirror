<br>Your site has some pretty lame security on it.. Allowing anon access
<br>to a PH QUERY and allowing it to execute commands and view files and
<br>also I would recommend upgrading your security so this does not happen
<br>in the future.. I was nice, but some other might not be
<br>
<br>P.S.- What is the freaking IP for telnet access to this thing? Anyone know? Email: emarris@talk21.com
<br>BTW - That is an anon email address! Dang I feel so i33t today! LoL!
<br>
<br>And for the freaks on IRC, I am here and will always be, look out for me
<br>I will card your freakin @$$ off and if I dont then it is time for blastoff
