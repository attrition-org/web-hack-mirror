didn't we already tell yew to fix j00r sekurity?<P>
We already hacked lottoteam.com so we figure that lottoteam.de would complete the picture.
We were hoping you would take our message to heart and attend to security issues. As you 
have not done so, we have hacked yet another one of your domains, free of charge.
Everybody wants security, so Admin: Please take the time to secure your box. This 
defacement was done with no malintentions, we are just trying to get our message
across. Email us
and we will help you out.</big><P>
