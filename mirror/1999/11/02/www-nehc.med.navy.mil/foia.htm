Enacted in 1966, the Freedom of Information  Act (FOIA) was the first law to establish an effective legal right of access to government  information, underscoring the crucial need in a democracy for open access to government  information by citizens. In the last 30 years, citizens, scholars, and reporters have used  FOIA to obtain vital and valuable government information. </p>  <p>Since 1966, the world has changed a great deal. Records are no longer principally  maintained in paper format. Now, they are maintained in a variety of technologies,  including CD ROM and computer tapes and diskettes, making it easier to put more  information on-line. </p>  <p>My Administration has launched numerous initiatives to bring more government  information to the public. We have established World Wide Web pages, which identify and  link information resources throughout the Federal Government. An enormous range of  documents and data, including the Federal budget, is now available on-line or in  electronic format, making government more accessible than ever. And in the last year, we  have declassified unprecedented amounts of national security material, including  information on nuclear testing. </p>  <p>The legislation I sign today brings FOIA into the information and electronic age by  clarifying that it applies to records maintained in electronic format. This law also  broadens public access to government information by placing more material on-line and  expanding the role of the agency reading room. As the Government actively disseminates  more information, I hope that there will be less need to use FOIA to obtain government  information. </p>  <p>This legislation not only affirms the importance, but also the challenge of maintaining  openness in government. In a period of government downsizing, the numbers of requests  continue to rise. In addition, growing numbers of requests are for information that must  be reviewed for declassification, or in which there is a proprietary interest or a privacy  concern. The result in many agencies is huge backlogs of requests. </p>  <p>In this Act, the Congress recognized that with today's limited resources, it is  frequently difficult to respond to a FOIA request within the 10 days formerly required in  the law. This legislation extends the legal response period to 20 days. </p>  <p>More importantly, it recognizes that many FOIA requests are so broad and complex that  they cannot possibly be completed even within this longer period, and the time spent  processing them only delays other requests. Accordingly, H.R. 3802 establishes procedures  for an agency to discuss with requesters ways of tailoring large requests to improve  responsiveness. This approach explicitly recognizes that FOIA works best when agencies and  requesters work together. </p>  <p>Our country was founded on democratic principles of openness and accountability, and  for 30 years, FOIA has supported these principles. Today, the &quot;Electronic Freedom of  Information Act Amendments of 1996&quot; reforges an important link between the United  States Government and the American people. </cite></p>  <p><a href="index.htm">Return to NEHC Home Page</a></p></blockquote><a><hr></a>
