<p>
The NAVY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CENTER originated in 1964 at the Navy Bureau of Weapons which recognized the need for an occupational health program that would encompass all fleet readiness and training ordnance field activities.  The Bureau directed the Commanding Officer, Naval Ammunition Depot (NAD), Crane, Indiana, to address this need by broadening the command's occupational health function.  This expanded mission included providing assistance to all naval ammunition depots and naval stations in coordinating their occupational health programs and resulted in the completion of the first industrial hygiene survey.
<p>
From 1965 to 1967 the Crane program steadily expanded in response to new mission requirements for personnel education and survey procedures.    In May 1967, the Bureau of Weapons formalized this function by establishing the Naval Ordnance Systems Command Environmental Health Center under the auspices of the NAD Crane Medical Department.
<p>
On July 1, 1970, the Center became a Headquarters Detachment of the Naval Ordnance Systems Command (NAVORD) subsequently becoming the Naval Ordnance Environmental Health Center (NOEHC).    One year later in 1971, NOEHC was brought under the control of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery and was renamed the Navy Industrial Environmental Health Center.
<p>
In July 1974, the Center became the NAVY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CENTER (NAVENVIRHLTHCEN),  an echelon 3 shore activity under the command and support of the Chief, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery.    In the fall of 1978 the command was relocated to Norfolk, Virginia.  This relocation was undertaken in response to an increase in requests for fleet support and further expansion of NAVENVIRHLTHCEN 's occupational health mission.  This expanded role included responsibility for the Navy Occupational Safety and Health Inspection Program (NOSHIP), analytical laboratory services, radiation health, hazardous materials identification, asbestos hazard control, preventive medicine, epidemiology, and hearing conservation.
<p>
NAVENVIRHLTHCEN's mission was expanded again in 1981 to include coordination and provision of centralized support and occupational health, environmental health, and preventive medicine services to medical activities ashore and afloat.  The NAVY DISEASE VECTOR ECOLOGY AND CONTROL CENTERS and NAVY ENVIRONMENTAL AND PREVENTIVE MEDICINE UNITS were placed under NAVENVIRHLTHCEN as echelon 4 commands at that time.

The growth  NAVENVIRHLTHCEN  experienced during the 1980's culminated with the command's relocation to ample, modern spaces, specifically designed to accommodate its needs and support its mission.  This move consolidated all NAVENVIRHLTHCEN departments and staff into one location.  Prior to this move the various departments had worked out of three separate facilities for the past ten years.
<p>
In October 1990, NAVENVIRHLTHCEN assumed responsibility for the management of the Navy Drug Screening Laboratories.  In 1995  NAVENVIRHLTHCEN was restructured to better serve our customers.  At the same time the Executive Steering Committee voted to change the command's name to the "Navy Preventive Medicine Command" to reflect more accurately the mission and purpose of the command.  This name change is currently pending.</h4>
