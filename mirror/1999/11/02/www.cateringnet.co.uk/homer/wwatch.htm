<b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial" color="Purple">The Tea Council</b><br><a href="http://www.teacouncil.co.uk" target="main">www.teacouncil.co.uk</a>
<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial" color="Purple"><p>A comprehensive website has been set up and dedicated to the nation's favourite cuppa.  The tea council has taken it upon themselves to give us a site which includes everything and anything we ever wanted to know about tea.  From statistics to varieties, from ideal food accompaniments to recommended brewing times.</p>  
<p>It also includes information on the Tea Council Guild of Tea Shops - tea serving premises recognised as conforming to the exacting standards of quality that the Tea Council believe are essential.  The site also provides information on the growing claims that tea is beneficial to good health.</p></font>

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial" color="Purple">Freshbake Foods</b><br><a href="http://www.cateringnet.co.uk/freshbake" target="main">www.cateringnet.co.uk/freshbake</a>
<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial" color="Purple"><p>Pie, pastry and meat product manufacturer, Freshbake has launched its internet site to provide the pub, restaurant and cost conscious caterer with ideas to tempt your customers and increase your sales.</p>
<p>The easy to navigate and fresh-looking site features Freshbake's four main brands, Baughans, Unger, Yankee and Wisebuy and suggestions on how to vary your menu options in 1999.</p>  
<p>A section of the site is devoted to each of the key brands.  Each page lists the full product range, explains portion availability and provides recommended cooking instructions.</p>  
<p>The section on Baughans, explains how this pastry brand's heritage and consistency can help boost your menu with its pies, pasties and pastry slices.  The section on Unger features its famous sausages, chipsteaks  and other popular meat products.  The Yankee section introduces us to a unique range of products, which are ideal for serving as hand-held snacks.  And the Wisebuy and Junior Wisebuy sections focus on products dedicated to the cost conscious caterer.</p>
<p>A simple, informative and useful site.</p></font>

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial" color="Purple">Douwe Egberts</b><br><a href="http://www.douwe-egberts.co.uk" target="main">www.douwe-egberts.co.uk</a>
<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial" color="Purple"><p>Coffee producer Douwe Egberts has just launched a new website which in addition to information about its products also provides the user with the history of coffee and coffee shops.  The site also features a history of the company, positions its instant coffees as the perfect pick-me-up along with other non-coffee pick-you-up tips, and on its conoisseur page includes a very brief list of ingredients aimed at making simple dishes into a gourmet's delight.</p>  
<p>The site provides a full product guide, including information on it recently launched Cafinesse - a liquid instant coffee stored in the fridge; and instructions on how to make coffee.  Until 28 February, visitors to the site have the opportunity of winning a two night break to Amsterdam.  The site also has a link into www.coffeetv.com/ which is sponsored by douwe-egberts.</p></font>

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial" color="Purple">Coffee TV</b><br><a href="http://www.coffeetv.com" target="main">www.coffeetv.com</a>
<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial" color="Purple"><p>As Britains spent £730 million on coffee last year, it comes as no surprise that a website is dedicated to coffee.  As well as general information on trends in coffee drinking and the process of coffee making from bean to cup, the site includes information about coffee around the world.  So far it has featured Belgium and is currently featuring the UK, with promises of other countries to come.  It lists cybercafes, but so far its list is restricted to those in Belgium.</p>  
<p>The site also promises a professional section coming soon.</p></font>
