<blockquote>
    <p>The Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program is
    designed to afford communities real opportunities for growth
    and revitalization. The framework of the program is embodied
    in four key principles:</p>
    <p><a href="#ec-opp"><i>Economic Opportunity</i></a></p>
    <p><a href="#sustain"><i>Sustainable Community Development</i></a></p>
    <p><a href="#CBP"><i>Community-based Partnerships</i></a></p>
    <p><a href="#vision"><i>Strategic Vision for Change</i></a></p>

    <h4>Economic Opportunity</h4>
    <p>The first priority in revitalizing distressed communities
    is to create economic opportunities- jobs and work- for all
    residents. The creation of jobs, both within the community
    and throughout the region, provides the foundation on which
    residents will become economically self-sufficient and
    communities can revitalize themselves. Opportunities for
    entrepreneurial initiatives, small business expansion, and
    training for jobs that offer upward mobility are other key
    elements for providing economic opportunity and direction.</p>

    <hr size="5" width="500">
    <p><a name="sustain"></a></p>
    <h4>Sustainable Community Development</h4>
    <p>The creation of jobs is the first critical step toward the
    creation of a livable and vibrant community where human
    initiative, work, and stable families can flourish. However,
    economic development can only be successful when part of a
    coordinated and comprehensive strategy that includes physical
    development as well as human development. A community where
    streets are safe to walk, the air and water are clean,
    housing is secure, and human services are accessible, and
    where a vital civic spirit is nurtured by innovative design,
    is a community that can be a source of strength and hope to
    its residents. A community where learning is a commitment for
    life can foster the skills, habits of mind, and attitudes
    that will make work rewarding and families nurturing.</p>
    <p>The Presidential Empowerment Initiative seeks to empower
    communities by supporting local plans that coordinate
    economic, physical, environmental, community, and human
    development.</p>

    <h4>Community-Based Partnerships</h4>
    <p>The road to economic opportunity and community development
    starts with broad participation by all segments of the
    community. The residents themselves, however, are the most important elements of
    revitalization.  Others may include the political and
    governmental leadership, community groups, health and social
    service groups, environmental groups, religious
    organizations, the private and nonprofit sectors, centers of
    learning, and other community institutions. </p>
    <p>Communities cannot succeed with public resources alone.
    Private and nonprofit support and involvements are critical
    to the success of a community seeking revitalization.
    Partners also must be created within and among the levels of
    government. Government departments and agencies on all levels
    must work together to ensure that relevant programs and
    resources can be used in a coordinated, flexible, and timely
    fashion to help implement the community's strategic plan and that
    regulatory and other barriers to sustainable growth are
    removed.</p>
    <p>Through the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community
    process, the Federal government offers a compact with
    communities and State and local governments: if you plan
    comprehensively and strategically for real change, if the
    community designs and drives the course, we, the Federal
    government, will waive burdensome regulations whenever
    possible, and work with you to make our programs responsive
    to your plan.</p>

    <h4>Strategic Vision for Change</h4>
    <p>A bold and innovative vision for change describes what the
    community wants to become -- for example, the community may
    envision itself as a center for emerging technologies with links to a nearby university or
    community college; a key export center for certain farm
    products, customized manufacturing goods, or health and other
    human services; or a vibrant residential area focused around
    an active local school, with access to jobs, retail markets,
    recreation, and entertainment. </p>
    <p>The vision for change is a comprehensive strategic map for
    revitalization. It is a means to analyze the full local
    context and the linkages to the larger region. It builds on
    the community's assets and coordinates its response to its
    needs -- such as public safety, human and social services,
    and environmental protection. It integrates economic,
    physical, environmental, community, and human development in
    a comprehensive and coordinated fashion so that families and
    communities can work together and thrive. A strategic plan
    also sets real goals and performance benchmarks for measuring
    progress and establishes a framework for assessing how new
    experience and knowledge can be incorporated on an on-going
    basis into a successful plan for revitalization. </p>
