<h5>A Message From Bill Clinton<br>
President of the United States</h5>

<p><img src="../Graphics/Clinton.gif" align=left hspace=0 width=120 height=150><img src="../drop_caps/F.gif" align=bottom width=34 height=43>or too long, the plight of America's inner cities and 
distressed rural communities was ignored. Private enterprise 
had abandoned these areas -- taking the deposit, but then 
moving the capital elsewhere. And the Federal government's 
top-down, prescriptive approach to helping poor communities 
didn't work.</p>
<p>The Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community (EZ/EC) initiative signals a new 
partnership between Washington and America's communities -- a partnership that 
recognizes the importance of a bottom-up revitalization process where people can 
seize opportunities for themselves. It targets $2.5 billion in federal tax incentives 
and $1.3 billion in flexible grant assistance to distressed urban and rural areas. 
Rather than imposing restrictive federal mandates on America's communities, this 
effort recognizes that local residents know best how to solve their neighborhood's 
problems. And it rewards communities that bring together many local partners -- 
residents, business people, state and local government, nonprofit institutions -- to 
make these solutions a reality.</p>
<p>In December 1994, Vice President Gore and I announced EZ/EC designations for 
105 communities in 42 states. I have also asked the Vice President to chair the 
Community Empowerment Board, an interagency task force that is helping EZ/EC 
communities empower their residents and implement their visions for a better future. 
Since the EZ/EC designation, our Administration has been working diligently to 
reinvent the relationship between the federal government and America's 
communities. This home page is an important part of our efforts.</p>

President of the United States<br>
