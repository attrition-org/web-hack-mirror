<blockquote>
    <p>The nation has made great progress in the past four years:
    11 million new jobs were created; unemployment and inflation
    remain low; the economies of many cities, such as Detroit,
    have improved dramatically; poverty has dropped for two years
    in a row; violent crime has plummeted in major cities; states
    and cities are in good fiscal shape; and welfare dependence
    has declined by 2.4 million people.</p>
    <p>But many neighborhoods, cities, and people have yet to
    benefit from Americas growth and prosperity As we move into
    the 20th century, our great challenge is to reclaim broken
    lives and rebuild neighborhoods that were bypassed by the
    American Dream. Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities
    can help us meet this challenge.</p>
    <p>These pages on the World Wide Web are designed to help
    citizens, nonprofit groups, businesses, and local governments
    learn about what is happening in Zones and Communities all
    across America, including their own. If progress is rapid,
    local partners in the community rebuilding process should
    know about it and share in the success. If progress is
    stalled, they have all the more reason to be aware of it, so
    that they can help overcome obstacles that block their
    community's prosperity, As we enter the new millennium,
    success in solving long- standing problems in America's
    cities will come from a new partnership between an informed
    citizenry, a reinvented government, concerned community
    groups, and local businesses of every size . Sharing the
    progress of America's EZ's and EC's is a good step in that
    direction.</p>
    <p>President Clinton has proposed a second round of
    Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities because the
    gains we've seen so far, when public and private resources
    are focused on problems the community itself has identified,
    are encouraging. In these Web pages, you'll see the great
    progress that many cities selected in the first round have
    made; and in all cases you'll see a vision of communities
    striving for their full potential.</p>
    <p>We welcome your ideas and thoughts on the EZ/EC home page.
    Please let us know how we can improve the information
    provided. And local Zones and Communities would welcome
    feedback and support as they work to restore hope and
    opportunity to their distressed neighborhoods and reclaim
    their share of the American Dream.</p>
    <p>Andrew Cuomo<br>
    Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</p>
