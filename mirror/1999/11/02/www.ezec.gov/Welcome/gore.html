><IMG SRC="/drop_caps/i.gif" ALT="I" ALIGN="LEFT" VSPACE="5"> want to welcome
you to the Empowerment Zones/Enterprise  Communities (EZ/EC) initiative's home
page.  This on-line  resource will not only provide information on the Federal
Government's EZ/EC program  but also will provide communities across America
with opportunities to communicate among each other and with other resource
organizations.</P>
<P>
On the EZ/EC home page, you will see demonstrations of the interagency
commitment to assist EZ/EC communities in their strategic revitalization plans. 
It consists of an advanced computer mapping section that highlights the federal
resources dedicated to EZ/EC  neighborhoods and provides additional demographic
information about EZ/EC communities.  This home page contains a toolbox of
decision-making  aids to help communities identify resources and overcome
barriers to  success. And there is access to an information database of  Federal
resources -- upcoming grant awards, targeted technical  assistance, and removal
of regulatory barriers -- to which EZ/EC  communities have been given
preference.</P>
<P>As we move forward in implementing the EZ/EC program, I  anticipate many
more challenges and great successes ahead. The  EZ/EC home page will be a
valuable tool in this process,  improving communication and collaboration
between community  residents, Federal government agencies, and the many other 
partners working to make these communities'  revitalization  strategies a
reality.</P>
<P>In invite you to make comments or suggestions about additional resources you
would like to see featured on the home page.</P>
