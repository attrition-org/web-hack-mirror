    <p>The following people worked the many long days, nights and
    weekends it took to completely redesign, write the content
    and create this Web site in 26 days. Their creativity,
    dedication, determination, and vision--along with their
    ability to consume large amounts of Chinese food, pizza and
    soda--contributed to the depth of content of this site and
    provides the residents of the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise
    Communities with a great resource for economic and community
    development.<br>

    was unveiled to the public by Vice President Al Gore on
    Wednesday, July 26, 1995 at a special White House conference
    for the Empowerment Zone (EZ) communities. The event included
    a video conference between the White House, the Rio Grande
    Valley EZ in Texas and the Baltimore EZ in Baltimore,
    Maryland which was made possible through the generous support
    of the <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel Corporation</a>
    and Innovative Research Technologies, Corp (IRTC). Intel
    contributed the Proshare video conferencing hardware and the
    assistance of Herb Marks. IRTC contributed the expertise of
    Herb Bricewell who setup the hardware at the White House and
    the Baltimore site. Without their able assistance the video
    conference would not have gone off any better than it did --
    which was perfectly. Their efforts made it possible for the
    people in the two Enterprise Zones to attend the White House
    Conference and to demonstrate the power of the computer,
    video camera, and ISDN to bring even the most remote sites
    together to share their experiences with the Vice President
    and their colleagues.</p>
