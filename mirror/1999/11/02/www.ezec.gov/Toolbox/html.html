<blockquote>
    <p>Creating community home pages and posting them on the Web
    is one of the primary purposes of the EZ/EC WWW server. Since
    we are not born with the knowledge necessary to build Web
    documents, we thought it would be helpful to build a guide
    that points to resources and tools that can help you build
    your Web pages.</p>

    <h4><a name="one"></a>The Basics: HTML Editors</h4>
    <p>HTML stands for <u>H</u>yper-<u>T</u>ext <u>M</u>arkup <u>L</u>anguage.
    It is HTML that makes web documents look the way they do. It
    accomplishes this by setting &quot;tags&quot; within the
    text, which then tells the browser (what you use to view Web
    pages) how to format the document. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><code>&lt;h5&gt;Sample Paragraph&lt;/h5&gt;<br>
        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;quick&lt;/i&gt; brown fox jumped
        over the lazy &lt;b&gt;dog&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </code></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here's what the same paragraph looks like displayed
    properly.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <h5>Sample Paragraph</h5>
        <p>The <i>quick</i> brown fox jumped over the lazy <b>dog</b>.</p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>For those who have used the original versions of Wordstar,
    HTML should look familiar. The most important thing to keep
    in mind is that in order for text to appear in special
    formats such as bold, centered, or in tables, it needs to be
    surrounded by tags. You should also keep in mind that some
    tags cannot be placed within other tags because doing so
    would violate the rules of HTML coding. Some editors may
    allow you to break the rules, but you then run of risk of not
    having your document appear properly in all browsers. </p>
    <p>Here is an example. HTML rules state you cannot insert a
    paragraph tag <code>&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt; </code>within a
    header (title) <code>&lt;h1&gt; . . .&lt;/h1&gt;</code> tag
    because paragraphs and headers are designed for different
    layout purposes. Some editors do not allow you to make such
    mistakes. Our recommendation is that you use those editors to
    create your pages. It may be a bit more trouble, but you can
    be assured that your pages will be read properly by all
    browsers.</p>

    <h4><a name="two"></a>HTML Authoring Guides</h4>
    <p>There are a lot of guides out there that can help teach
    you how to write HTML documents. Below are links to a few of
    them that can help get you started. </p>
    <p>NOTE: These sites will also help you with inserting
    graphics, tables, making a background color of a graphic
    transparent and creating clickable images (ISMAPS).</p>

    <h4><a name="five"></a>Graphics</h4>
    <p>Graphics can add a lot to your web sight. While they make
    the pages more appealing visually, they can also add a long
    wait for those who are connecting to your site with a 14.4 or
    slower modem or through one of the many on-line services.
    Here are a few tips for incorporating graphics.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Keep images as small as possible:</b> Do not use
            full-page graphics. A full screen is somewhere around
            640x480 pixels and a full color image that size could
            take as much as 500K of space and may take as long as
            5 minutes to load and view. Please keep in mind that
            people are paying for accessing the Internet and
            large graphic files literally cost them time and
            money. If you do insist on using large graphics, you
            should do two things:<blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indicate the size of the file in
                        kilobytes, e.g., (500k)</li>
                    <li>Provide a non-graphical method of
                        accessing the same page (text-based) </li>
                </ul>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li><b>Use small color palettes:</b> A color palette is a
            list of the colors that are being used in a given
            image. The higher the number of colors, the more
            memory the file will use. For example, the icon on
            the right, when <img src="../graphics/back.gif"
            alt="demo icon" align="right" hspace="0"> saved with
            a 256-color palette, requires 2,256 bytes of memory.
            The same icon saved in a 16-color palette needs only
            257 bytes. Smaller files mean faster page load times.</li>
        <li><b>Use Alternate Names:</b> HTML permits you to
            assign text to a graphic that, for some reason, may
            not be visible to the user. Reasons could include the
            misnaming or mislocating of a graphic, or the user
            may be using a non-graphical text-based browser such
            as Lynx. This is especially important if you use the
            graphics as a navigational button. Assigning the
            alternate text consists of adding the command <code>ALT=&quot;text&quot;</code>
            command to the <code>&lt;IMG SRC&gt;</code> tag.</li>

    <p>Everyone wants to know how many people have visited your
    site or a specific Web page. Looking around you will see lots
    of different types of access counters ranging from graphics
    that look like automobile odometers to regular numbers. Here
    are some sources for page counters.</p>

    <p>Once you have your site established and your pages
    on-line, you need to tell the world that you exist. One way
    to do it would be to hunt down all of the different
    directories and list with them individually. Another way is
    to go to one page that helps you register with the main
    directories (which is what we did). Here is the one we used:</p>

    <h4><a name="eight"></a>Setting Up A Web Server <img
    src="../graphics/newflag.gif" width="35" height="11"></h4>
    <p>Setting up a web server to handle your own content _can_
    be a rewarding experience. The Web provides you an
    opportunity to highlight your community in a manner that is
    available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. You can use it do
    distribute economic development reports, promotional
    materials, and much more. We believe the Web will become one
    of the primary tools for communication in the near future.</p>
    <p>Setting up servers can also be expensive. Start-up costs
    for hardware and software can easily reach $4,000 to $15,000.
    There are very good servers available for free (see the links
    below) and are the basis for a large majority of the Web
    sites currently available. Charges for space on an existing
    machine can range from $30 to $100s per month, depending on
    the level of service and design costs. There will also be
    expenses for labor, maintenance, and document management.
    Communities thinking about setting up a service ought to
    contact a local Internet Service Provider (<a
    href="http://thelist.com/">ISP</a>) to obtain rate
    information before setting up their own service.</p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community
    designees and Champion Communities may setup web sites on the
    <a href="../index.html">www.ezec.gov </a>server at no
    charge. If you represent one of these communities, please
    send a message to <a href="mailto:webmaster@ezec.gov">webmaster@ezec.gov</a>
    requesting more information.</p>
