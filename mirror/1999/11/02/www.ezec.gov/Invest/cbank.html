<H3>Preface</H3>
</a><br>
<P>On December 21, 1994, President Clinton and Vice President Gore announced
the designation of twelve of America's large cities as the focus of American
urban policy. For the next ten years some of the poorest and most marginalized
neighborhoods in these cities will be Federal Empowerment Zones, Supplemental
Empowerment Zones or Enhanced Enterprise Communities ("<a
href="#en1">Zones</a>").
 The Zone program combines the best elements from generations of urban and
social welfare programs with the tools and experience of the community
development movement. It incorporates the "comprehensive neighborhood"
approach, which ran successfully from the 1960's Model Cities program through
the Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and Urban Development Action
Grants (UDAG) of the 1970's and 1980's. The two-pronged strategy: (1 ) focuses
on leveraging private investment; and (2) fosters community development
institutions. Underlying both prongs is the recognition of the limitations and
the need for improvements in private credit markets in urban area.</P>
<P>It is no accident that each city applying for Zone designation proposed the
creation of a community development financing mechanism. These communities are
characterized by inadequate investment. They all suffer from barriers to credit
access, where the demand for credit is not being met by existing financing
institutions and mechanisms. They all have experienced <a
href="#en2">redlining</a>
and abandonment by traditional sources of capital and financing institutions.
They all lack thriving small businesses, owned and operated by community
residents. They all have witnessed the movement of earnings and profits out of
their communities. And, they all bear high real costs of doing business due to
crime, drugs, lack of training and assistance for entrepreneurs and home owners.
</P>
<P>It is easier to recognize the problems than to know how to design the
solution. The goal of this Federal program is to generate economic development
-- jobs and income -- by providing capital and the tools to use that capital, so
that the people in these communities can improve their lives and become
self-sufficient. The operative word is "empowerment." This paper lays
out one approach to designing the Zone financial entity, after briefly surveying
the field of community development finance. The financial "empowerment"
model here is one (of many possibilities) which focuses on community needs and
objectives; provides special assistance to Zone businesses and neighborhood
housing groups; targets job creation geographically; and creates public/private
partnerships. Most importantly, it is designed to provide linkages to the other
major structures and programs of the Zone, such as job training, improved
education, the introduction of new technology, community policing.</P>

<h3><DL><DT>EMPOWERMENT ZONE FUND: A MODEL</DT>
<DT>BACKGROUND</DT></DL></h3>
<P></a></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Fifty years after the end of World War 11, the American economy has changed 
dramatically. It is more closely tied to the rest of the world than ever, with
imports and exports having tripled their share of national output and the United
States now the world's largest debtor nation. Gone is the American dominance in
consumer manufacturing, and with it many high wage assembly line jobs. Banks,
airlines, telephone companies, and broadcasting have been deregulated and
buffeted by rapid changes in technology and competition.</P>
<P>Nowhere is the juxtaposition of the rapidly integrating global market and
the isolated neighborhood economy a more obvious dilemma than in America's
central cities. As the urban economic base has gone from producing mainly goods
to producing  services, the largest cities have lost more than half of their
manufacturing jobs, which had provided employment for many residents. While
urban areas still draw new immigrants and young professionals, today inner
cities have lost a sizeable working population and have some of the country's
greatest concentrations of poverty, unemployment, and educational drop-outs.
There are visible pockets of economic decline: whole blocks of shops remain
vacant and boarded up for-years and housing has deteriorated beyond the point of
redemption. There are entire inner city  neighborhoods without banks and
licensed taxicab services, <a href="#en3">getting by</a>
on shadow substitutes that are expensive and perform poorly.</P>
<P>At the local level there has been much focus on the access to capital and
credit that are essential to a healthy economy. Without it, businesses cannot be
born or expand, residents cannot buy, sell or repair their homes, and local
communities cannot offer economic opportunity to their members. In many
communities, those who need credit cannot get it or cannot afford it. Often they
have nowhere to go. They have been ignored or abandoned by conventional
financial institutions.</P>
<P>The capital market failures, and the resulting gaps in capital availability,
are now <a href="#en4">well documented</a> and understood.
 Many potential borrowers cannot access credit because they do not meet
conventional credit standards. Real factors raise the cost of credit: the impact
of crime and drugs on neighborhood businesses and property values; the higher
underwriting and  transactions costs of small business loans; the lack of
training and technical assistance. programs for small business owners that
prevent them from developing viable business plans and becoming effective
business managers. In addition, there are some ways of doing business, such as a
high aversion to risk, unfair means of screening (e.g. redlining), lack of loan
standardization procedures, liquidity, and public regulations limiting
lenders' ability to rely on certain types of collateral, which characterize
market failure as well. These "capital gaps" have generated a number
of responses, from communities, government, financial institutions, and
nongovernment organizations (NGOs), to provide access to capital in starved
neighborhoods. The most extensive and successful have been in housing finance. <a
href="#en5">*Note</a></P>
<P>The focus on the housing market is easy to understand. First, the urban
deterioration and loss of affordable housing in low and moderate income
neighborhoods is highly visible. Housing values reflect a neighborhood's value
and vice versa. Since the late 1960's, experts have pointed to the inability to
access financing as the major source of the problem. They blamed redlining for
severely limiting the number of low and middle-income buyers, resulting in
property deterioration and abandonment. Without access to financing,
neighborhood stability is compromised, since existing property is not maintained
or rehabilitated, potential buyers cannot enter the market and present owners
cannot refinance.</P>
<P>Second, housing is important in every one's life. Improving its quality and
creating greater access to it generate notice and get neighbors involved.
Housing needs provide an excellent organizing issue and a point of political
pressure. Third, the housing finance market is huge and well organized, with a
strong infrastructure of specialized financial institutions. Until recently,
savings and loan institutions' sole purpose was to provide mortgages for home
ownership. There are other organizations which guarantee and insure mortgages,
bundle them and use the income flows to back bonds, thus ensuring a thriving
secondary market. In this way, the mortgage product is standardized, financial
institutions act as generators, but not necessarily holders, of mortgages, and
long-term investors have a liquid investment.</P> 
<P>Finally, the government is a significant actor in housing credit. It
regulates the financial institutions which originate mortgages. Through the FHA,
it insures mortgage loans. Through institutions such as <a href="#en6">Fannie
Mae, Ginnie Mae, and Freddie Mac,</a> it has created the mortgage backed
security, which is the foundation of the secondary mortgage market.   It provides
the mortgage interest deduction for home ownership in the personal income tax.
It provides the low income tax credit and subsidies to corporations for low
income multi-family housing. It supports rents, through subsidies to families
with low income. It provides rent money through income transfer programs.</P>
<P>The threatened loss of affordable inner city housing and the substantiation
of the practice of redlining by traditional financial institutions generated a
significant response. There are now an extensive array of programs, policies and
institutions at work in the inner city housing credit market. These combine
credit market regulation and reforms, infusions of capital, new housing finance
products, new development organizations, and new types of financing
institutions. These changes are the result of public/private/non-profit
partnerships as well as conscious government policy.  Some examples serve to
illustrate the success and the limitations of efforts to open up access to
capital in inner city neighborhoods.</P>
<P>The best known of the policy tools has been the <a
href="#en7">Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA),</a>  which directly addresses access to
credit.  In the CRA, Congress requires regulated financial institutions to
demonstrate that they serve the "convenience and needs" (including the
need for credit) of the communities in which they are chartered to do business
and empowers regulators to encourage financial institutions to fulfill this
mission "consistent with the safe and sound operation of such <a
href="#en8">institutions</a>".
 The <a href="#en9">regulators </a> also assess an
institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community,
including the low- and moderate-income ones, and take that record into account
in evaluating any application for a branch. The CRA has the potential to reverse
many of the disinvestment trends that plague the urban credit markets, and <a
href="#en10">"...though precise estimates are unavailable, it
is clear that significantly more money is being invested in central cities than
would otherwise be the case."</a> But, the CRA's impact has been
limited largely to physical improvements such as commercial projects and
housing.</P> 
<P>At the same time, new organizations have sprouted to restore downtown areas
and revitalize neighborhood housing and commercial strips. in a number of
cities, - private business readers, in partnership with the government, have
revitalized downtown areas with new development that encompasses offices,
hotels, convention facilities and tourist attractions. In other cities, the
private sector, leveraging government housing and mortgage guarantee programs,
has focused on stabilizing neighborhood housing in areas that border on
abandonment, but still have preservable housing stock.  Coincident with the
improvements in housing finance has been the growth and expansion of a number of
community development corporations (CDCs), some of  which specialize in housing
and others of which try to spread the model to financing small business
development. CDCs are small-scale developers focused on both the physical
improvement of their neighborhoods and the entrepreneurial and organizing skills
of their volunteers and members. The National Congress for Community Economic
Development (NCCED) serves as their trade association.  Most receive help from
foundations and philanthropic organizations, and some are even formed by
commercial banks or groups of financial institutions.</P>
<P>Working as intermediaries to these CDCs are three major national non-profit
organizations which are not, themselves, community based: the Local Initiatives
Support Corporation (LISC); the Enterprise Foundation; and, the Neighborhood 
Reinvestment Corporation. They act as financial intermediaries by helping to
create and expand a secondary market to raise funds for lending, and they
re-cycle capital back to CDCs. <a href="#en11">In addition, they
provide technical assistance as well as some  financial and operating support to
CDCs.</a></P>
<P>Interestingly, these various approaches to housing finance represent a
weaving of "national" policy and institutions (e.g., CRA and the
secondary mortgage market), with "local" actors (e.g., CDCs and
CDHOs). Ultimately, many of the local initiatives have served as national
models. Most importantly, with considerable analysis and experience, the
broadening and deepening of the housing credit market and the effort to
eliminate barriers to credit for low and moderate income inner city residents
has involved separating a "huge problem" into a number of specific
types of credit and types of housing, and then applying targeted new solutions
and new financial products to each.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, many financial institutions interpret CRA as applying solely
or primarily to mortgage lending and the access to mortgage finance. For many,
improved access to business credit is not yet addressed.  <a href="#en12">Yet,
there  is evidence of significant credit "gaps...for long-term and
unsecured debt for new. . .and early stage businesses, equity financing
for...businesses. ..that are unlikely to go public, and for small businesses
that want to develop new products..."</a> While there is a push by
advocates to strengthen CRA in business lending, the gaps in the business credit
market have been approached as well through the creation of a number of new
financial institutions focusing on local economic development.</P>
<P>The Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFls), which have emerged
in the past twenty years, offer the link between community housing finance and
community economic development. With little government support, this is now a
$700 million CDFI industry which has generated more than $2 billion in loans.
While some have focused most successfully on housing finance, they generally see
themselves as carrying a mandate to encourage entrepreneurship, self-sufficiency
and creative problem solving, <a href="#en13">CDFls measure
their success by both traditional profit standards and by the building of
linkages with the rest of the local economy -- businesses, professions,
voluntary organizations, churches, families, etc.</a></P>
<P>CDFls take a number of forms, pursuing different segments of the business
and credit markets. Here are the main types:</P>

<H2>Community Bank Holding Companies</H2>
<P></a></P>
<P>CD bank holding companies -- their affiliated banks and for-profit and
nonprofit corporations -- provide credit to community businesses and households
through a traditional, federally insured and regulated deposit institution, such
as a bank, credit union or savings and loan. They provide other services through
non-depository affiliates. Like traditional financial  institutions, these
holding companies grow by retaining profits from their investments and by
attracting additional outside capital. As banking, or thrift, institutions, they
face the same regulations and judgements on loan quality as traditional
financial institutions, which constrains the ability to reach under-served
markets. Such standard depository institutions cannot take an equity stake in a
community business; they cannot provide training or support services; they
cannot finance a small business incubator. Their ratio of loans to deposits is
strictly regulated. Therefore, they use subsidiaries or affiliates, which may be
for-profit and non-profit, to perform such functions and provide other
development needs, such as technical assistance, subsidies or grants.</P>
<P>Perhaps the best known CD bank is <a href="#en14">Shorebank
Corporation, </a>founded in 1973.   Organized as a bank holding company,
its principal subsidiary is the South Shore Bank of Chicago, a regulated,
deposit bank. In addition, there are three wholly-owned subsidiaries in the
Chicago area: a profit-making real estate group; a (501 )   (3) tax exempt
affiliate, that initiates and manages economic development projects; and a for
profit and SBA-licensed minority enterprise small business investment
corporation (SSBIC) that makes equity capital and subordinate loan investments;
and, Shorebank is now expanding into other urban areas and into providing
technical assistance on community development finance. The history of South
Shore illustrate the strengths and limitations of regulated banks in community
development finance. <a href="#en15">It took South Shore Bank
about ten years to become profitable.</a> Initial campaigns to increase
deposits from the neighborhood community failed for the most part, as did the
initial strategy of consumer and commercial lending. Through time, profitability
came from reaching outside the community for deposits (to foundations,
corporations, religious groups, and wealthy individuals) in the form of "development
deposits" and by concentrating lending on the rehabilitation of
multi-family housing (the predominant form of housing) in the South Shore
neighborhood of Chicago. The success of South Shore Bank is attributed to its
own capital base which makes it self-sustaining, the fact that the scale of its
endeavor being appropriate to the problem, and the ability to attract resources
to the community. Its diversification into other financing institutions and the
development of a separate arm for technical assistance make it the prototype
community bank holding company.</P>

<H2>Community Development Credit Unions</H2>
<P></a></P>
<P>Like all credit unions, CDCUs are regulated, federally insured,'tax exempt
depository institutions that are owned cooperatively by their members, governed
on a one-person-one-vote system.  Most CDCUs offer a basic package of retail
banking services -- bank accounts; check cashing; financial planning; and
personal, car, tuition and home repair loans. Tight ratios of loans to deposits
by regulators constrain the ability of credit unions to leverage significant
amounts of capital. Their contribution to community development comes largely
from their ability to provide their members with access into the financial
mainstream of the credit market: a history of credit worthiness, secure savings,
regular deposits and payroll deductions, and sound personal financial
management. Of the estimated 12,000 or so credit unions, there are as many as
1,000 CDCUs around the country. The National  Federation of Community
Development Credit Unions claims 125 members, in 35  states, which serve
predominantly low-income communities. Roughly two-thirds are in inner cities and
one-third in rural areas. <a href="#en16">According to the
Federation, these CDCUs have loss rates of less than 2 percent.</a> All
credit unions make loans to their members; CDCUs strive to make loans that
enable members to get and keep jobs, start and expand businesses, and improve
members' property. Many CDCUs also work with other community organizations to
lend to rehabilitate apartment buildings.</P>

<H2>Community Development Loan Funds</H2>
<P></a></P>
<P>CDLFs are unregulated and uninsured financial intermediaries that raise
capital from (individual and institutional) social investors at below market
rates of return. They do project lending primarily to non-profit and cooperative
housing and business developers, thus filling a highly specialized market niche.
For these types of projects, access to financing from more traditional sources
may be blocked due to a lack of credit history, or the need for extensive
technical assistance, or the fact that many community development projects are
not standardized and require multiple sources of finance, with requirements
specially tailored to the individual circumstances. In other instances, there
may be a high risk or long-term payoff, putting them beyond the reach of
traditional lenders, and, even, involving the CDLF in an outright interest rate
subsidy. CDCLs also operate as a bridge to conventional permanent financing by
providing a reliable initial source of funding; conventional lenders commit
after the CDLF loan provides comfort about the adequacy of the project's
collateral. Generally the small cooperative structure of CDLFs allows low-cost
provision of capital, reflecting superior access to specialized information-and
a high degree of repayment loyalty. By 1995, the industry had existed about 20
years, with most of the growth in the last 10; only forty four funds belonged to
the self-regulating National Association of Community Development Loan Funds,
which sets voluntary fiduciary standards. Capitalization approaches $170
million, including about $45 million of equity.  Approximately 3,400 individual
and institutional investors have provided the assets and accepted below-market
rates of return. <a href="#en17">Despite the absence of
traditional risk management policies, default rates have been less than 2%.</a>
</P>
<P>A large and successful example of this model is the Community Preservation 
Corporation in New York City. Founded and capitalized in 1974 by a number of the
City's banks, it has financed the rehabilitation/construction of more than
38,000 apartment units (about a $1.25 billion investment), focusing on
stabilizing neighborhoods before they deteriorate. CPC serves as an
intermediary, bringing together borrowers and developers, lenders and pension
funds willing to provide a forward commitment for mortgage takeouts, and public
agencies with subsidy and guarantee programs. It has managed to ensure fixed
rate construction financing at a time when the outside market has not provided
it. Public subsidies lower the cost of private capital and provide guaranteed
mortgages at market rates to pension funds and banks; but, by blending the
market rate with the publicly subsidized capital, CPC provides the borrower with
a below-market rate loan. <a href="#en17"> CPC </a>generates
its income through interest spreads on construction loans, commitment fees, and
servicing fees. This model, through collaboration with Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, is being replicated in Chicago and California.</P>

<H2>Micro-Loan Funds</H2>
<P></a></P>
<P>These entities concentrate on a unique segment of the business credit market
and represent the smallest, least well capitalized, and least profitable part of
the CDFI industry.  <a href="#en19">They make short-term loans,
on average only two years, of small amounts for the start-up or expansion of
small businesses.</a>   In general, these funds fit within larger programs
that comprise a comprehensive strategy to promote entrepreneurship. Given the
small size of the loans, the high transaction costs, and the costs of providing
technical assistance to borrowers, it is unlikely that such programs can be
self-sufficient, even charging market rates of interest. Yet, they represent a
comprehensive approach: the combination of skills development, creation of a
credit history, job creation and financial education that may be viewed as an
anti-poverty strategy as well as a strategy to improve the functioning of
capital markets. <a href="#en20">Micro-lending was pioneered in
the developing world, by Accion International in Latin America and Bangladesh's
Grameen Bank.</a>  Micro enterprise is generally associated with the
informal economy (unregulated, small-scale, and primarily made up of home-based
enterprises), where there is generally not a separation between worker and
owner, or, if there is, pay and working conditions are not regulated. <a
href="#en21">Those who lack mobility and/or access to formal
employment are usually captives of the informal sector, and many
micro-enterprises are home-based.</a> The hallmark of the developing
country approach to micro-lending is the peer-group model, in which a small
group of would-be entrepreneurs come together for the purpose of obtaining
credit. After training and analyzing each other's business plan, the group
selects a plan to receive the first loan. <a href="#en22">Once
payments on that loan remain current for a set period of time, other members of
the group are eligible to borrow.</a> In most programs, if one member
defaults, no one else is eligible to borrow. Members meet regularly to evaluate
business plans, track repayments, exchange information and lend moral support.
Group borrowing creates tremendous peer pressure to repay loans, and, by
assuming administrative tasks, lowers the servicing costs
</P>
<P>In the United States, micro-businesses are also described as very small
-capitalized with less than $5,000 and usually employing less than five people.
They tend to offer services oriented toward retail trade, other services or
construction, and may be part of a cooperative, or located in a home or a
commercial strip. <a href="#en23">Some enterprises are even
part-time.</a> <a href="#en24">This is a growing part of
the American economy, with an estimated 51 million people engaged in home-based
businesses, alone, a 56% increase in the past five years.</a> As in the
developing world, micro-enterprises are important in neighborhoods where there
are few formal job opportunities and where there are people who have little
formal education and training. Most micro-businesses lack access to traditional
credit institutions, since in order to qualify for a business loan, a borrower
must have collateral. Past that threshold, a business still has to satisfy
relatively high income standards, have an established and verifiable credit
history, and prove legal residency. In addition, the credit application process
is complicated, lengthy, and time consuming. Traditionally in many immigrant
groups, the extended family replaces the formal credit market as a source for
start-up and small business capital.</P>
<P>In response to the lack of traditional credit sources for small scale
entrepreneurs, American micro-loan funds were fostered during the 1980s - the
first being established in 1983 -- by the Ford, Rockefeller and Charles Stewart
Mott Foundations, seeking to replicate the successful programs abroad. In 1987
the federal government began providing aid to Micro enterprise programs in the
United States. There are currently about 200 micro-enterprise development
programs  operating in almost every state; only 132 of them provide capital,
while the rest offer technical assistance, peer support and help in the
formation of peer groups. Collectively, these programs have loaned in excess of
$44 million to more than 208,000 clients. In the U.S., micro-enterprise lending
generally follows the standard model of individual lending; <a
href="#en25">only
about 20% operate group lending programs, even though about two-thirds of the
programs work with low-income individuals or those receiving Aid to Families
with Dependent Children.</a></P>
<P>In the future, CDFls expect stronger Federal government support. In addition
to the Zones, whose financial entities will link with CDFls, there will be the
Federal CDFI Fund, established by the Community Development Banking and
Financial Institution Act of 1994, a Clinton Administration initiative. The Fund
has $50 million for FY1995 (significantly smaller than the proposed $370
million), one third of which must go to banks or bank dominated (more than 25%
bank ownership) organizations . <a href="#en26">The funds will
provide matching money, on a dollar to dollar basis, to CDFls for:</a>
commercial facilities that promote revitalization, community stability, job
creation or retention; businesses that provide jobs for low income people or
that enhance the availability of products and services to low income people;
community facilities; basic financial services; low income housing; and
technical assistance of all types.</P>

<H2>THE E-Z FUND</H2>
<P></a></P>
<P>Even with the advent of community development banking and new commercial and
 non-profit institutions, there are serious problems with the capital markets in
Zone neighborhoods. No major city has a comprehensive "delivery system"
providing financing, technical assistance, and support for both housing and
economic  development. As importantly, there is a continuing need to build
community involvement in economic development, to foster and reward
entrepreneurial behavior, and to improve and deepen the Zone community's
understanding of and participation in the economy. All the Zones recognized this
and proposed creating a community financial entity to address these problems
directly. But, both the role and the structure of such an entity is new and, to
some extent, path breaking.</P>
<P>This section lays out <b>one</b> example, to serve as a
template, of a financial entity for any Empowerment Zone. The model presented
here should be taken as representing the <b>minimum set of requirements</b>
for a financial entity to play a central role in the economic life of the Zone.
From this point on, the Zone financial entity will be called the E-Z Fund, known

<P>It will attain this goal by: <b>leveraging private capital</b>

<P></a></P>
<P>In effect, the EZF will be a bridge across the existing as well as any newly
 created financial programs to ensure the maximum and appropriate use of all. It
does not duplicate, dismember or displace existing financial institutions.
Rather, it helps to focus their work in an organized fashion, serving as a
highly visible economic presence, creating strong linkages to and among the
economic actors in the Zone, especially the private sources of capital. To play
this role, the EZF (in conjunction with the Zone Board) will need to work
cooperatively with existing institutions presently providing capital in the
Zone, involving them in regular discussions and assessments of the Zone's credit
needs and how to meet them.</P>

<P><center><I><a href="#up">Return to Table of

<P></a></P>
<P>Local control and empowerment is an EZF goal, also. Improving the economy
and raising the standard of living of the Zone residents extends beyond ensuring
better access to capital and creating new wealth. It requires increasing the
ability of Zone residents to understand and participate in the economy -- as
consumers, savers, home-owners, employers and employees. This will require
education and the use of incentives to reward risk-taking and generate returns
from savings. It involves recognizing and exploiting fully the Zone's
competitive advantages; lessening many of the distinctions between the Zone and
surrounding areas; building the capacity of neighborhood organizations to
stabilize and upgrade their areas by providing technical assistance and
leadership training; and ensuring a skilled and education work force. In
cooperation with commercial financial institutions, entities formed by the Zone
legislation, and the major civic institutions, the EZF has a pivotal role to
play in fostering this goal.</P> 
<P>Further, local control and empowerment are embodied in the EZF, itself. Its 
procedures and operations must be open, accessible -- and nondiscriminatory, 
with emphasis on serving the poor and those who have been excluded. It will 
emphasize building relationships, ensuring that small loans and their repayment
generate eligibility for subsequent loans. As the community grows, it will grow.
As the Zone's economic needs change, it will have the flexibility to change its
size and scale of operations. It will be controlled by the Zone community and
accountable to that community -- its owners -- and to the Zone Board.</P>
<P>Finally, it will be owned by Zone residents. As their institution, it will
foster individual savings and promote economic participation. Even as a
nonprofit corporation, the EZF's survival will require that its community owners
adhere to a business plan, determine its rate of expansion and growth, ensure
its ability to generate cash and reserves against losses, chart its course in
the innovation of new services and support to the Zone's businesses, and direct
its ability to leverage public and private sources of capital. In this way,
during the ten years of the Zone experiment, the community will be creating a
permanent, sustainable institution that can survive beyond the term of the
Federal funding. Under certain circumstances, the community may also be involved
in selected ownership ventures, through a separate and distinct subsidiary of
the EZF.</P>

<P><A NAME="how"> </P>
<H4>HOW DOES IT CONNECT TO THE REST OF THE ZONE?</H4>
<P></a></P>
<P>First, this model assumes that the Zone is governed by an independent,
non-profit governing board (Zone Board). While the relationship between the Zone
Board and the EZF may vary from Zone to Zone, the EZF here, through its
governance  structure, is subordinate and accountable to the Zone Board. This
assumption means, for example, that the Zone Board's Strategic Plan will be the
blue-print coordinating financial services with employment training, education,
home-ownership and other goals. Also, it is the role of the Zone Board to
coordinate all parts of the  implementation of the Zone's Strategic Plan,
including setting the-priorities and issuing approval of all programs and
projects.   </P>
<P>Second, while the relationship between the EZF and other Zone institutions
and structures will be determined by the Zone Board, for the EZF to work
properly there should be numerous ties to housing, social services, employment
training and (financial) educational structures within each Zone. Chart I offers
a prototype of a Zone's main institutions and the relationships among them.</P>
<P>Third, this model assumes that there are a number of existing financial
institutions within, and outside, the Zone, which meet some, but not all of the
Zone's capital needs. Therefore, a large part of the role of the EZF is to
identify what is missing and why, to coordinate and, if necessary, convene and
organize the players in a way to meet the Zone's strategic plan and deliver the
capital to the area's economy. This portion of the EZF's mission makes it an
attractive candidate for help from philanthropic and non-profit allies, many of
which are doing similar work around the country.</P>
<P><center><I><a href="#up">Return to Table of
Contents</a></I></center></P><HR>
<P><A NAME="whom">  </P>
<H4>TO WHOM DOES IT BELONG?</H4>
<P></a></P>
<P>The EZF will be chartered as a <a href="#en27">not-for-profit
or co-operative corporation which will receive, manage and disburse the bulk of
the funds related to the Zone.</a> It will be capitalized by at least two
sources: Federal and other government funds flowing into the Zone; and equity
issued to residents of the Zone who choose to become owners. Additional
capitalization is highly desirable and hopefully will be raised <a
href="#en28">from
private foundations and philanthropic organizations, banks, pension funds or
other sources.</a></P>
<P>The EZF will be owned by Zone shareholders, who will be free to buy and sell
shares at will, or according to the rules they, themselves, lay out. The charter
will stipulate that there must be a threshold level of earnings generated and
retained in each of the years of the decade-long Zone program to ensure the
EZF's ongoing viability and its long-run permanence. It is realistic to expect
it to take at least five years for the EZF to achieve the experience to generate
a revenue flow, from fees and interest, which will make it self-sufficient.</P>
<P>The EZF will be governed by a Board of Directors, reflecting the community 
ownership of its outstanding equity and its accountability to the Zone Board.
There are many possible variations, depending on the size of the Zone Board, the
number of shareholders, the number of strong institutional relationships, etc.
However, the general principle of a smaller, more manageable and more
participatory Board is the goal. A Board which does not exceed fifteen members
is envisaged here. It is suggested that the charter stipulate that the EZF Board
of Directors be comprised of six appointees of the Zone Board and five persons
elected by the shareholders; be elected by the shareholders at an annual meeting
at the EZF or at the Zone Board headquarters; and, include the Chief Executive
and Chief Operating Officer of the EZF.</P>

<H4>WHAT DOES IT DO?</H4>
<P></a></P>
<P>Given the state of the Zones' local capital markets, described earlier,
there are a number of functions which the EZF will need to ensure take place:
</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="acg"></P>
<H4>Assess the Capital Gaps</H4>
<P></a></P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>At inception, and then on a recurring basis, the EZF will need to survey and
 catalogue the financial infrastructure of the Zone. It is possible that much of
this was done in the process of applying for Zone status. However, the EZF will
have to ensure it possesses a comprehensive, thorough and up-to-date baseline
description of the Zone's financial infrastructure. In addition, the EZF will
need to develop the internal staff to update the baseline periodically and be
the repository of the detailed institutional information of the Zone's financial
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>This survey will be instrumental in determining where there are gaps in
providing capital for small business creation and job growth, for large
commercial development, for housing and neighborhood improvement, and even for
public infrastructure within the Zone.  It will provide the basis on which the
EZF will determine which capital programs it may initially have to provide
directly and in which segments of the market it will need to serve as a catalyst
to further development, consolidation, or outreach among existing institutions.
</P>
<P>While some of this work may be done outside of the EZF, it is not desirable
that the knowledge of the Zone's capital market and its limitations, as well as
the connections to the financial and business organizations, resides permanently
outside of the EZF. So, while this part of the mission will require a huge range
of skills from the staff, it is worth developing from the beginning, to ensure
the strongest long term role for the EZF.</P>
<P><a href="#en29">In performing this assessment, the EZF will
likely ask the following of the Zone's businesses and the wider financial
community:</a></P>
<UL><LI>Where is the generation of demand?</LI>
<LI>Are there various credit products (e.g., subordinated debt, equity,
commercial mortgages, micro loans, contract receivable financing, etc.)
available?</LI>
<LI>What is the state of the origination and servicing of loans?</LI>
<LI>Are there enough funds?</LI>
<LI>Are there credit enhancements, such as guarantees and insurance, where
necessary?</LI>
<LI>Is there liquidity?</LI></UL>
<P>In answering these questions, the EZF will also be establishing important
linkages to the business community and their needs as well as to the credit
practices of the financial community.</P>
<P>The answers to these questions will reach to much larger issues of
organization and maturity in the Zone's capital market players. For example, the
generation of demand involves making sure there is a steady stream of qualified
borrowers, which often takes extensive outreach and technical assistance to
fledgling entrepreneurs and developers. It will govern the programs to be
provided by the Clinic (discussed below) as well, perhaps, as the establishment
of some special incubators in the Zone. On the other side of the market,
liquidity involves providing access to a secondary market, through the bundling
and securitization of loans, to help to leverage a steady stream of private
capital from commercial banks and other depository institutions, pension funds,
and foundations.</P>
<P><center><I><a href="#up">Return to Table of

<P><A NAME="czcmi">  </P>
<H4>Coordinate the Zone's Capital Market Institutions</H4>
<P></a></P>
<P>Initially, the EZF can create a "forum" for the Zone's CDFls as
well as intermediaries such as LISC to gather and begin to work together. At its
most basic this 'forum" will serve to improve the flow of information,
which should provide a plus to improving the market.</P>
<P>This role will start with the EZF assembling all the financial entities,
lenders, etc. into the same room, talking and working together. That mission may
require quite a bit of work to be successful. The EZF will need to recognize and
manage the concerns of the existing financial entities toward its arrival on the
scene. Many of these actors have been involved in the Zone community for a long
time; some may remain or participate in this new endeavor most reluctantly. One
cannot underestimate the difficult nature of making all of them comfortable with
the mission and the organization of the EZF. If coordination, communication, and
information sharing were easy, there would likely be more of it among the
present actors. Issues of "turf" and institutional jealousies, as well
as inertia, will need to be overcome. In addition, once issues turn from
organization to capital allocation, regulated depository institutions may face
anti-trust problems and issues of apportioning appropriate CRA credit with joint
or pooled action. It is assumed here that the EZF, HUD and the President's EZ/EC
Task Force can be called upon to intervene or work with the regulators to help
to overcome such regulatory barriers should they arise.</P>
<P>Once the EZF has determined the strengths and weaknesses of the Zone's
capital market, it will, on behalf of the Zone Board, generate a strategic plan
to oversee the growth of the institutions to fill the vacant roles. At a
minimum, the EZF must be capable of engaging in a sophisticated search process
to identify possible outside providers to serve in these roles. If such
providers are not found, the EZF must be capable of providing the staffing to
initiate a business plan and organize the effort to establish entirely new
entities.</P>
<P>As a fully integrated financial infrastructure develops and grows within the
Zone, the EZF will help the existing institutions to delineate clearly their
roles, as well as their relationship to the EZF and to each other. To clarify,
sharpen and usefully define the lines between different types of entities -such
as retail, revolving and micro loan funds; the SBA One-Stop-Capital-Shop; and
community development banks -- will help in determining not only which entity
does what (survey noted above), but also which can expand~ to cover unfilled
demand.</P> 
<P>To perform this role, the EZF and the Zone Board will have to focus not only
on traditional issues of capital provision, but also on issues of organization.
Within the context of the ~forum" that the EZF provides, it can raise
issues of mergers or consolidations of CDFls and CDCs; help to create stronger
relationships among some of the major actors in the Zone through interlocking
boards of directors or advisors for some of the development and financial
entities; establish a central physical location providing inexpensive and
convenient space for these entities; and give training for board members and
staffs. In many ways creative consolidation to foster growth among existing and
fledgling institutions may prove to be one of the most important and innovative
roles open to the EZF. Ultimately, it may need to draw on some financial
incentives to accomplish this.</P>

<H4>Provide Access to Capital</H4>
<P></a></P>
<P>The EZF will serve as a gate-opener to capital for Zone businesses -- the
only stop necessary to satisfy capital needs. In this role it will be aided
enormously by the SBA's One-Stop-Capital Shop, which may handle a good part of
the small business referrals. Still, the EZF will need to make sure that the
smallest needs, especially the micro lending which is outside the scope of the
SBA, are covered and encourage the establishment of peer group lending and
support. Depending on a business's product/service and the stage of development
of the management, the EZF staff will determine the size and risk of the
necessary financing and capital sources. A goal of the EZF will be to develop a
long-term relationship with existing and potential Zone entrepreneurs to assure
the proper type of financing for Zone businesses throughout their growth
process. Indeed, the EZF's success as the entry point into the financial system
will rest strongly on its ability to assess needs according to the level of
management skills, the stage of service or product development and the size of
the (potential) market being served.</P> 
<P><center><I><a href="#up">Return to Table of
Contents</a></I></center></P><HR>
<P><A NAME="lend">   </P>
<H4>Lending</H4>
<P></a></P>
<P>Lending provides a source of income support for the EZF, through origination
and servicing fees as well as possible interest rate spreads. While the needs
and gaps in the Zone's capital market (determined above) should govern the focus
of the EZF's lending, an astute business sense will be needed to judge the
market opportunities and get the pricing right.</P> 
<P>Even with banks and other financial institutions making loans, there is
likely to be a useful market niche for the EZF in providing small loans for
short time periods to business people who simply do not have access to the
sources of private capital. Since the issue is often availability and access,
rather than price, there is a potential for strong income flow. Another
potentially productive area for the EZF in providing capital to larger Zone
businesses may be the provision of subordinated debt -- a smaller and less risky
(thus lower return) role in financing than taking an ownership stake.</P>
<P>As noted earlier, the EZF will provide access to a number of sources of
business lending, covering traditional SBA, commercial bank loans,
micro-enterprise, working capital loans, project finance, commercial mortgages,
physical or technological improvement loans, single family and multi-family
housing finance, etc. No matter the source of the lending, the EZF will actively
involve experienced entrepreneurs and professionals from within, and
occasionally from outside, the Zone community in monitoring the loans and the
subsequent business development. In addition, it will provide technical
assistance to help to ensure the survival of businesses involved in the loan
programs within the Zone.</P>

<P><A NAME="ebd"></P>
<H4>Encourage Business Development</H4>
<P></a></P>
<P>In its efforts to create good borrowers, the EZF will operate a Business
Development Clinic (the Clinic). The Clinic, in collaboration with the
educational and service organizations of the Zone, will identify and aid likely
entrepreneurs and developers through the processes of business planning,
including marketing, financial and other studies. It will deliver comprehensive,
professional help, technology transfer, and entrepreneurial training to Zone
entrepreneurs and businesses. It will serve as an information clearinghouse,
provide free business consulting services, hold workshops to bring together
entrepreneurs and investors, and coordinate technology initiatives with local
educational institutions and job training facilities to help link Zone business
development with the employment of Zone residents.</P>
<P>Realistically, the EZF cannot depend on a steady flow of "customers"
coming through its doors, especially at the beginning. It will have to serve as
a catalyst, seeking out foundations, other non-profits, and public organizations
to help fund the up-front costs of such preliminary business development
planning and demand generation.</P> 
<P><center><I><a href="#up">Return to Table of

<H4>Ownership Capital</H4>
<P></a></P>
<P>It is not clear that taking an equity stake is a realistic option for-the
EZF. It is not necessary for the Zone's success in generating jobs, income and
economic growth. Much can be done through an array of lending arrangements and
debt instruments, which carry lower risk. However, the ownership decision should
not be precluded here.</P>
<P>If the Zone Board wishes to pursue this option, then there should be an
ownership vehicle set up independently from the EZF. A Venture Capital Fund
needs an entirely separate organization from the EZF: an independent board of
directors, an independent board of investment advisors, and a separate staff.
Not only must there be independent and professional expertise in all aspects of
risking capital, but also it must be seen to be there. This ensures a fire-wall
between the investment decision and all the other relationships being fostered
in the Zone. This is not to say that the EZF's experience with a local business
gets lost in the calculation. But rather that a fresh set of eyes examining the
venture adds to the assurance of it being worthy of investment. It also provides
the Zone Board, the EZF Board, the Venture Fund Board, and all potential
customers, with a clear division of responsibility and lines of authority. Based
on their experience, most community development financing experts feel strongly
that a single entity, without such clear lines of authority and divisions of
responsibility will have problems performing well both the education/advocacy
function and the investment function. too.</P>
<P>The Venture Capital Fund allows its owners to share in the ownership of
enterprises within the Zone, generating profits and dividends flowing to the
shareholders. However, the levels of risk are not appropriate for the average
Zone resident and may be unacceptable to all but a small group of wealthy or
large institutional investors. If a Venture Fund is operating properly, some of
its investments will fail. Issues of insulating community investors from those
failures need to- be raised at the outset. There are different types of
ownerships and tiers of rewards stemming from them. There may need to be
consideration given to providing limited liability to community residents and
their institutions if they participate in the Venture Fund</P>
<P>For the sake of prudence and diversification, even an independent Venture 
Fund may want always to work in partnership with other equity investors,
including private venture capital funds, pension funds doing economically
targeted investing, and other partnership funds, inside or outside the Zone. The
Zone's Venture Fund may act in concert with other sources of capital to form a
public-private partnership for industrial development or educational pursuits
within the Zone.</P>

<H4>Empower Economic Participation</H4>
<P></a></P>
<P>The purpose of the Zone is to improve the economy, which will involve, in
part, encouraging the development of traditional economic behavior on the part
of Zone residents. Working in tandem with other Zone organizations and with
traditional financial institutions, including savings and commercial banks, the
EZF will need to encourage savings by Zone households. In part this will mean
reaching out to residents, to school children, churches and civic organizations
and providing a range of educational classes on household and business financial
management. The EZF, although not a depository institution itself, will need to
locate depository banking on-site for the convenience of Zone residents and
businesses. The EZF will need to ensure that local businesses provide
internships and summer jobs for Zone students. The EZF might also work with the
employers to have the wages paid through a  depository institution, thus
introducing students to financial institutions and providing the basics of
credit education. The EZF can also ensure that local business leaders conduct
regular presentations at elementary and secondary schools in the Zone to build a
understanding of business operations, entrepreneurship, and business  planning.
</P>
<P>The EZF and the Clinic will coordinate to provide technical assistance,
training and counseling to Zone residents to foster home ownership. Both will
provide credit education, consumer, saver and investor classes to Zone
residents, including the development of a teaching module for the Zone schools
</P>
<P>Most importantly, through equity and Zone residents' ownership, the EZF
offers a basic lesson in corporate governance, as well as the management and
control of financial organizations. It offers a unique opportunity for the
Zone's residents and their civic infrastructure to form, run and control an
organization of their own. The EZF's structure, organization, interaction and
community links are the community's to shape.</P> 
<P>To do all of these functions well and to fulfill its mission, the EZF will
require first-rate direction, organization, staffing and technology. The success
of the EZF requires a superior professional staff. A significant part of the
EZF's work is strategic and directional, which requires professionals who
understand the various components of the Zone's capital market needs and are
able to produce a series of strategic plans throughout the ten year period of
the Zone's life.  A different aspect of the EZF's work is outreach, which
requires "people" skills to ensure the EZF becoming rooted in the Zone
community. And, of course, there will be an ongoing need for staff who know and
can work with the various CDFls in and around the Zone.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>
<P></a></P>
<P>This paper is a discussion document, presenting a model for the Zone cities
to draw on as they build their community development financial institution.</P>
<P>History has shown that the task of broadening and deepening Zone capital
markets is not an easy one. The forces pulling capital to other uses are
considerable and growing stronger. The forces generating profitable
opportunities for growth in America's central city communities are fragile, with
the high real costs of doing business and of making loans and investments
often-a significant barrier.
</P>
<P>Fortunately, the past decade or more has brought changes in community
capital institutions, here and in less developed countries, which offer lessons
on which to draw. There are a range of community development organizations and
financing  institutions -- private, profit-making, non-profit and public --
which have grown up to fill special niches and needs in inner cities, struggling
daily to build viable investments. They have been most successful, not least due
to the Community  Reinvestment Act and tax and other policies, in improving the
financing of housing in inner city neighborhoods. Innovations in business
finance and development have come more slowly and in smaller amounts.</P>
<P>These organizations cannot do the job by themselves. Their size is dwarfed
by the needs and the potential; they are small, specialized and, often isolated.
They need organizational help. They need resources. And, they need to be drawn
together into a delivery system which is easy to use and meets borrowers' and
communities' needs.</P>
<P>The model presented here -- an EZF capital delivery system -- attempts to
make those linkages. The model sets forth a market intermediary, working between
those who supply capital and those who would be their customers in the Zone. It
goes beyond the information supplier and intermediary role, to envisaging an
institution which actively makes loans and works in partnership with others to
develop successful Zone businesses. And, it connects the Zones' financial needs
to the rest of its economy -- to its residents, its students, its work force,
its churches and civic institutions.</P> 
<P>It is the goal of the Federal Empowerment Zone program that the communities
chosen will, over the next ten years, grow jobs and income. The model presented
here is meant as a mechanism to help make that happen and to ensure that as it
does, the benefits and the rewards are reaped by the communities and their
residents.

Testimony focused on redlining by private  lenders, real estate brokers and
various government agencies and clearly  substantiated research, some dating as
far back as the 1920s, which revealed that some urban communities and residents
were facing difficulties in obtaining funds for purchasing, refinancing,
