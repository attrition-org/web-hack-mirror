        <p>The Los Angeles Community Development Bank (LACDB) is
        a critical economic development tool and provides the
        opportunity for Los Angeles to invest more than $1billion
        of working capital, equity and grants over the next ten
        years to organizations in those areas needing an economic
        stimulus. The Bank's activities will enhance and
        invigorare the existing economic development
        infrastructure. </p>
        <p>Though not a commercial lending institution, the Bank
        will provide access to capital with funds from the
        Department of Housing and Urban Development, private
        lending institutions, and from proceeds of the sale of
        bonds. These funds will stimulate job creation and
        business growth in the designated Empowerment Zone and
        other low and moderate income areas of Los Angeles. Local
        businesses and community-based institutions located in
        these areas will become eligible for funds in the form of
        loans, loan guarantees, venture capital and grants.</p>
        <p>The Bank will make funds and technical assistance
        available primarily through investment in existing
        community-based lending organizations, thereby allowing
        most decision making to take place at the local level, by
        people who best understand the needs of the community.</p>
        <p>The Bank is a national model for economic development,
        as well as a true partnership between the City of Los
        Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, the federal
        government, private lenders, community organizations,
        businesses and entrepreneurs.</p>

                </em></a><p>Although not a bank in the legal
                sense, the LACDB will operate much like a bank:
                it will screen applications for loans and grants
                and determine the eligibility and
                credit-worthiness of borrowers; it will guarantee
                loans made by third-party lenders, participate in
                venture capital investments and provide outright
                grants to nonprofits and other eligible parties.
                The LACDB will not provide depository services.
                Interest earned on loans may be set aside to fund
                a variety of programs, social services, loan loss
                reserves and direct grants within the designated
                Empowerment Zone and other low- to moderate-
                income areas of Los Angeles.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>SOURCES OF FUNDS</em></p>
                <p>Beginning in mid-1995 the LACDB will be
                stage-funded over the first four years by a
                combination of federal Economic Development
                Initative (EDI) grants, totaling $115 million,
                and proceeds from debt guaranteed by the federal
                government ($315 million in U.S. Department of
                Housing and Urban Development Section 108 loan
                guarantees). In addition, the LACDB will receive
                funding by way of participating loans with
                private-sector banks and other lenders.
                Altogether, as federal dollars are used to
                &quot;leverage&quot; funds from the private
                sector, the LACDB anticipates financing more than
                $1 billion in new economic development in the
                targeted areas over the next ten years.</p>

                small and medium-sized businesses, manufacturers,
                franchisees, community-based organizations, and
                both for-profit and nonprofit developers. The
                Bank, through various intermediaries, will
                provide start-up equity capital for new business
                ventures without access to sufficient credit.
                Also, the Bank will join with other
                community-based lenders to provide
                &quot;bridge&quot; loans to companies unable to
                obtain similar loans elsewhere.</p>

                AREAS </em><p>Whether a company or an individual
                may apply for LACDB financing depends on a number
                of factors, including its location. To qualify
                for loans, a business must be either 1) in the
                HUD Section 108-eligible area; 2) the designated
                Empowerment Zone (see map), or 3) up to one mile
                outside of the Empowerment Zone, provided that at
                least 51% of the jobs created at the supported
                facility will be held by Zone residents.</p>

                LENDING COMMUNITY</em></p>
                <p>The success of the LACDB will depend upon its
                ability to partner with private-sector
                intermediaries to leverage its limited public
                funds to foster targeted economic development.
                The LACDB envisions operating in conjunction with
                a number of community based financial
                institutions, as well as other major financial
                institutions, to implement the LACDB programs (in
                addition to providing direct loans). In large
                part, the LACDB's role will be to support,
                recapitalize and make more flexible the funds in
                the existing community lending organizations
                (both financial institutions and intermediaries).</p>
