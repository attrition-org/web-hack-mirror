        Effective October 1, 1996, employers will have a new
        Federal tax incentive, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit
        (WOTC), to hire youth who reside in empowerment zones
        (EZ) and Enterprise communities (EC).</p>
        <p><a name="qlfyemplees"></a></p>
        <p><b>Qualifying Employees</b></p>
        <p>The employer may take the credit for hiring young
        EZ/EC residents -- individuals who are ages 18 through 24
        (high-risk youth) and individuals 16 and 17 years old who
        are hired to work between May and September (summer youth
        employees).</p>
        <p>The credit is available whether the EZ/EC youth works
        inside or outside of the EZ/EC, so long as the princioal
        residence of the youth is within the EZ/EC.</p>
        <p>The credit may not be claimed for wages paid to
        certain employees related to the employer or any owner of
        at least 5% of the business.</p>
        <p><a name="creditamt"></a></p>
        <p><b>Credit Amount</b></p>
        <p>The maximum credit amount for high-risk youth is
        $2,100. The credit is equal to 35% of up to $6,000 in
        wages paid during the first year of employment. Only
        first-year wages paid to youth who begin work between
        October 1, 1996, and September 30, 1997, qualify.</p>
        <p>The maximum credit amount for summer youth is 1,050.
        The credit is equal to 35% of up to $3,000 in wages paid
        for any 90-day period between May 1 and September 15,
        1997.</p>

        <p><a name="hireincntve"></a></p>
        <p><b>Hiring Incentive</b></p>
        <p>The credit is only for qualifying employees hired
        after October 1, 1996. An employer cannot take the credit
        for wages paid to EZ/EC residents who are hired before
        that date.</p>
        <p><a name="cert"></a></p>
        <p><b>Certification of a Qualified Employee</b></p>
        <p>The employer must receive certification that an
        employee is a member of a qualified group from the local
        State Employment Security Agency (SESA) before the credit
        can be taken. The certification must be obtained from the
        SESA before an EZ/EC youth begins work for the employer,
        or the employer must fill out a pre-screening notice
        before making an offer to the employee, indicating the
        basis of the employer's belief that the individual is a
        qualifying employee, and submit this notice to the SESA
        as part of a written request for certification within 21
        days of the date the employee begins work. The
        pre-screening notice will be available from the SESA or
        from the IRS.</p>

        <p><a name="minwork"></a></p>
        <p><b>Minimum Work Requirement</b></p>
        <p>The employer may take the credit for high-risk youth
        only if the EZ/EC employee works for a minimum of 400
        hours or 180 days. If the credit is being taken for
        summer youth, the minimum work requirement is 120 hours
        or 20 days.</p>
        <p><a name="rptrqmnt"></a></p>
        <p><b>Reporting Requirement</b></p>
        <p>An employer reports the WOTC on IRS Form 5584. IRS
        forms are available on the Internet
        (www.irs.ustreas.gov), by toll free telephone
        (1-800-829-3676), or by computer and modem
        (1-703-321-8020 - modem settings N, 8, 1).</p>
        <p><a name="qulfdwages"></a></p>
        <p><b>Qualified Wages</b></p>
        <p>The credit is calculated on salaries and wages, as
        defined for Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) purposes and
        certain training and educational expenses paid on behalf
        of the employee.</p>
        <p>An employer must reduce the deduction for wages on his
        or her tax return by the amount of the WOTC taken for
        that employee.</p>
        <p align="center"><br>

        <p><a name="crrybcks-frwds"></a></p>
        <p><b>Carrybacks and Carryforwards</b></p>
        <p>The amount of general business credits, including the
        WOTC, which can be claimed in a single year is subject to
        a limit tied to the employer's taxable income, but the
        employer is allowed to carry forward or carry back unused
        amounts under the general business credit tax rules.</p>
        <p><a name="addqlyfng"></a></p>
        <p><b>Additional Qualifying Employees</b></p>
        <p>The WOTC is also available for five other targeted
        groups, regardless of whether they are residents of an
        EZ/EC: an individual who is a member of a family
        receiving family assistance (AFDC or its successor
        program), a veteran who is a member of a family receiving
        family assistance or food stamps, an ex-felon who is a
        member of an economically disadvantaged family, a
        vocational rehabilitation referral, or an individual who
        is at least 18 years old but not yet 25 and is a member
        of a family receiving assistance under the food stamp
        program.</p>
