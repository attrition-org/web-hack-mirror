    <h3>III. General Benefits of Development Tools</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A. Tax exempt bonds of any type typically access
        capital at a cost 1.5% to 2.5% lower than conventional
        financing (in today's markets) due to the investor's
        avoidance of federal and, in some cases, state income
        taxes on the interest paid</p>
        <p>B. Tax exempt and taxable conduit bonds issued by
        government issuers for privately owned projects provide
        certain federal securities laws and state securities laws
        exemptions, as well as exemptions in some states from the
        property taxes and sales taxes on the private owner
        financing the project</p>
        <p>C. The EZ wage credit is a direct credit, i.e.,
        reduction of an EZ business' federal income tax liability
        - up to $3,000 per EZ business employee living in the EZ</p>
        <p>D. The EZ expensing allowance provides an EZ business
        with as much as a $37,500 a year expense deduction on
        equipment purchases, which is a $20,000 increase over the
        179 $17,500 expense deduction and a more immediate tax
        benefit than a depreciation deduction.</p>
        <p>E.Tax abatement can be a total to partial forgiveness
        of state or local taxes for businesses located in
        specially designated distressed areas for various periods
        of time based on local law</p>
        <p>F. TIF is a tax exempt or taxable financing vehicle
        for projects in designated distressed areas for which the
        incremental taxes generated in such designated areas
        after a designated date are dedicated to the debt service
        on the project financed</p>
        <p>G. SBA debt is low rate debt for small businesses
        meeting the federal government criteria</p>
        <p>H. Other state incentives such as grants, guarantee
        programs and job training programs have self evident
        benefits. </p>

    <h3>V. EZ and EC Bonds</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A. 9 EZ's and 95 EC's were approved and designated on
        December 21, 1994 for ten year terms with EZ's getting a
        wider range of benefits</p>
        <p>B. EZ's get EZ bonds, EZ wage credit and EZ expense
        allowance </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <dl>
                <dt>1(a). EZ wage credit entitles any employer,
                    i.e. employer is not required to meet
                    enterprise zone business tests (other than
                    businesses on the 147 list and farms having
                    assets valued at in excess of $500,000) in EZ
                    to get a federal income tax credit or as much
                    as $3,000 per employee living in EZ if such
                    employee performs 90% of his or her services
                    in EZ, regardless of when hired. Under the
                    rule, an employer gets 20% of each EZ
                    employee's wage up to $15,000 in the first
                    seven years of EZ, declining by 5 % in each
                    of the last three years </dt>
                <dt>(b) Certifications from employees are
                    accepted as long as the employees are told
                    the EZ boundaries, certify that they live in
                    the EZ and are told to report a move out of
                    the EZ and so long as the employer does not
                    know that a certificate is false</dt>
                <dt>(c) Part time employees count, but short time
                    (less than 90 days) do not count</dt>
                <dt>(d) Special rules apply for 1994 based on the
                    same percentages for the wages paid to EZ
                    employees in the 11 day period from December
                    21 to December 31, 1994</dt>
                <dt>(e) Taxpayer must eliminate the amount of the
                    credit from the wage deduction, i.e., can not
                    double dip, so the credit is reduced by the
                    taxpayer's marginal rate </dt>
                <dt>(f) Wages of owners or relations of owners do
                    not count</dt>
                <dt>(g) Certain training and education expenses
                    paid on behalf of an employee may count as
                    wages if (i) paid to a third person and (ii)
                    the payments are excludable from the
                    employee's gross income under 127 (excluding
                    a maximum of $5,250 of such educational
                    expenses paid by an employer) or paid on
                    behalf of a person under 19 who is in a local
                    youth training program </dt>
            </dl>
            <dl>
            </dl>
            <p>2(a). EZ expensing allowance entitles a <u>qualifying</u>
            EZ business to take an expense deduction for up to
            $37,500 of equipment purchases each year as an
            exception to taking depreciation deductions to
            recover the cost of the asset. Such rule is an
            enhancement of the $17,500 expensing allowance
            already in 179 which exists independent of EZ status.
            Both have phase out provisions, 50 per dollar over
            $200,000 for EZ businesses and $1 per dollar over
            $200,000 for businesses under 179. </p>
            <p>(b)To get expensing allowance for 1994, taxpayer
            must have placed property in service in the Dec 21 -
            Dec 31, 1994 window</p>
            <p>(c)Provide examples of how it works for (i) EZ
            property, (ii) both EZ property and 179 property and
            (iii) both EZ property and 179 property with the
            respective phase outs taken into account</p>
            <p>(d)Property is &quot;qualified zone property&quot;
            if it is personal property used in taxpayer's
            business and placed in service in the tax year in
            question and is subject to the &quot;original
            use&quot; and &quot;substantial renovation&quot;
            rules which means (i) acquired after zone
            designation, either as <u>new</u> property or used
            property brought in from outside the zone and not
            previously used by the tax payer in the zone or (ii)
            if previously used by the taxpayer in the zone before
            the zone was created, 100% renovation (based on
            depreciated value). This means you can use the
            substantial renovation rule even if the property is
            bought prior to zone designation </p>
            <p>(e) In applying the expensing rule, the activities
            of related persons come into play on dollar limits
            and phaseout limits whereas they do not in the case
            of EZ and EC bond rules</p>
            <p>(f) Expensing must be elected</p>
            <p>3. EZ bonds and EC bonds may be issued at lower
            tax exempt rates as a form of exempt facility bond
            financing for the financing of &quot;qualified zone
            property&quot; for &quot;enterprise zone
            businesses&quot; which makes it important to know the
            definitions</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>(a) $3,000,000 per EZ / $20,000,000 per all
                    EZ's is the dollar limit </dt>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>(b) (i) &quot;Qualified zone property&quot;
                    means any property to which Section 168
                    (ACRS) applies or would apply but for Section
                    179, if (1) such property was acquired after
                    the EZ/EC designation, (2) the &quot;original
                    use&quot; <u>in the EZ/EC</u> commences with
                    the taxpayer (special rule in regulations for
                    property abandoned in EZ or EC for one year
                    or more even before zone designation) and (3)
                    90% of the use of such property is in an EZ
                    or EC and is used in the active conduct of
                    business by the taxpayer in the zone</dt>
                <dt>(ii) A special rule, however, is that if
                    property is substantially renovated (an
                    amount equal to 100% of the adjusted basis is
                    spent on rehab) during any 24 month period
                    beginning after December 21, 1994, the
                    property can be financed even though acquired
                    before the zone designation</dt>
                <dt>(iii) Special rule on sale-lease back allows
                    a newly built facility to be sold and leased
                    back within 3 months of completion and still
                    be treated as &quot;original use&quot;
                    property</dt>
            </dl>
            <p>(c) (i) &quot;Enterprise zone business&quot; means
            any trade or business of a proprietorship,
            corporation or partnership which <u>in each year</u>
            (1) would otherwise qualify if such were separately
            incorporated, which is significant because it means
            for purposes of compliance with the 35% employment
            rule and the 80% gross income rule and 90% use of
            assets rule (all as discussed below) one can allow a
            store, division or branch of a chain to qualify
            separately without worrying about activities, assets
            or liabilities of the rest of the company outside the
            EZ or EC, unlike the qualified small issue bond tests
            for compliance with the ten million dollar capital

    <h3>VI. <u>Qualified Small Issue Bonds</u> (QSIBs&quot;) or
    (&quot;IDBs&quot;) </h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A. IDBs are formally named &quot;qualified small issue
        bonds&quot; because the Internal Revenue Code exception
        which allows the interest thereon to be excludable from
        the bond owner's adjusted gross income is based upon the
        intent of Congress to favor governmental issuers which
        are attempting to encourage relatively small operations
        in the political jurisdiction where the bond financed
        project is to be located to create jobs and add tax base
        for that political jurisdiction. There are two small
        issue exceptions which may be elected by the issuer, one
        for deals of $1 million or less and one for deals of $10
        million or less (but with many more strings attached).</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>1. Under both exceptions, at least 95% of the
            &quot;net proceeds&quot; must be used for the
            acquisition, construction, reconstruction or
            improvement of land or property of a character
            subject to the allowance for depreciation
            (&quot;Substantially All Rule&quot;) which is part of
            a &quot;manufacturing facility&quot; or to redeem
            part or all of a prior issue which was so used (but
            including certain IDB financed facilities which were
            financed prior to 1986 which were not
            &quot;manufacturing facilities.&quot;) This means
            land, building and structure improvements, machinery,
            equipment and furnishings and capitalized interest
            during the construction period may be financed under
            the Substantially All Rule.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>(a) &quot;manufacturing facilities&quot;
                includes any facility which is used in the
                manufacture or production of tangible personal
                property (including processing resulting in a
                change in the condition of such property). It
                also includes facilities which are &quot;directly
                related and ancillary&quot; to a manufacturing
                facility if (i) they are located on the same site
                and (ii) not more than 25% of the proceeds are
                used to provide such facilities (office and
                warehouse issues).</p>
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>2. Any bond issue of <u>$1 million</u> or less for
            the purposes and within the general rules stated
            above can be a tax exempt QSIB, so long as: (i) there
            are not other QSIBs outstanding for facilities
            located in the issuing jurisdiction for the same
            company or related companies which when aggregated
            with the current issue do not exceed $1 million
            (&quot;One Million Dollar Rule&quot;) and (ii) there
            are not other qualified exempt facility bonds
            (&quot;EFBs&quot;) and qualified redevelopment bonds
            (&quot;QRBs&quot;) outstanding for facilities located
            anywhere in the United States and its territories for
            the same company and other test period beneficiaries
            which when aggregated with the current issue do not
            exceed $40 million (&quot;Forty Million Dollar
            Rule&quot;). A test period beneficiary generally
            means an owner or principal user, and related persons
            thereto, of a facility being financed at any time
            during the 3-year period beginning on the later of
            the &quot;in service&quot; date or the bond issue
            date. </p>
            <p>3. Any bond issue of <u>$10 million</u> or less
            for the purposes and within the general rules stated
            above can be a tax exempt QSIB, so long as: (i) the
            aggregate of the following four amounts does not
            exceed $10 million at any time within the six year
            counting period which begins three years before the
            bonds are issued and ends three years after the later
            of the &quot;in service&quot; date or the issue date
            (&quot;Six Year Period&quot;): (a) the amount of
            outstanding QSIBs for facilities located in the
            issuing jurisdiction (even if issued before the
            6-year period) issued for the same company or related
            persons; (b) the amount of the bonds currently being
            issued; (c) the amount of capital expenditures made
            by the company and all related persons for any and
            all facilities located anywhere in the issuing
            jurisdiction during the three year period before the
            bonds are issued; and (d) the amount of the capital
            expenditures made by the same group in the three year
            period after the later of the in service date or the
            date of issue (&quot;Ten Million Dollar Rule&quot;),
            and (ii) there is compliance with the Forty Million
            Dollar Rule described above. Because the Ten Million
            Dollar Rule is a springing test, i.e. there are
            compliance requirements for the three years after the
            bonds are issued, the interest on the bonds can
            remain tax exempt for a time period during the Six
            Year Period and then become taxable from the point
            that the Ten Million Dollar Rule is flunked. </p>

        <p>C. Public use is a requirement of EFBs, which means
        that such facilities must serve or be available on a
        regular basis for general public use, or be part of a
        facility so used, with sewage disposal facilities and
        solid waste disposal facilities being treated as
        automatically serving the public. </p>

    <h3>VIII. <u>General Requirements and Considerations
    Applicable To EZ and EC Bonds, QSIBs and EFs</u></h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A. &quot;Official Intent&quot; to reimburse itself for
        expenditures with bond proceeds must be declared not
        later than 60 days after the expenditure to be reimbursed
        with bond proceeds is paid; and the bonds must be issued
        not later than 18 months after the later of the date the
        payment to be reimbursed is made or the date the project
        financed with such payment is first placed in service
        (but in no event later than 3 years after the date the
        payment is made). In certain cases, 3 years may be
        extended to 5 years based on an architect's or engineer's
        certificate.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>1. The declaration of Official Intent must be made
            by the governmental issuer rather than the
            benefitting company, except in the case of 501(c)(3)
            issuers.</p>
            <p>2. The Official Intent must set forth: (a) a
            general description of the project to be financed,
            (b) the maximum dollar amount of bonds to be issued,
            and (c) the company to be benefitted. Reasonable
            deviations are permitted to the extent the actual
            project is reasonably related in function to the
            described project. </p>
            <p>3. Exceptions to the Official Intent requirement
            include (a) a <u>de minimis</u> amount equal to the
            lesser of (i) $100,000 or (ii) 5% of the proceeds of
            the issue and (b) &quot;preliminary&quot;
            expenditures of up to 20% of the issue price, e.g.,
            issuance costs, architectural, engineering,
            surveying, soil testing and similar early project
            costs, but not land acquisition, site preparation or
            actual commencement of construction costs.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>B. &quot;State Volume Cap&quot; ($50 per capita per
        state annually available, but not less than $150,000,000)
        must be allocated, unless certain facilities are
        governmentally owned or unless they are refunding bonds.
        Procedures vary from state to state. Exceptions include
        501(c)(3) deals, airports, docks and wharves,
        environmental enhancements on hydroelectric facilities
        and 75 % of high speed intercity rail facilities.</p>
        <p>C. &quot;Substantial Users&quot; of facilities
        financed or related persons thereto may not exclude
        interest from their own adjusted gross income if they
        become owners of such bonds.</p>
        <p>D. &quot;Maturity Limitation&quot; for such bonds
        provides that the weighted average maturity may not
        exceed 120% of the weighted average life of the
        facilities being financed.</p>
        <p>E. &quot;Limitation on Land Acquisition&quot; provides
        that the proceeds of bonds may not be used (1) in excess
        of 25% thereof for the purchase of land, or (2) for the
        purchase of farm land, with exceptions for first time
        farmers, EZ farmers and sound buffer land or wetland
        preservation for certain exempt facilities.</p>
        <p>F. &quot;Acquisition of Existing Property&quot; is
        limited for QSIBs and EFs (with special and different
        rules for EZ bonds and EC bonds). The limitation is that
        bond proceeds may not be used unless the first use of
        such property is pursuant to acquisition with such bond
        proceeds (i.e., it has to be new property), unless an
        amount equal to 15 % of the purchase price is spent on
        the rehabilitation of the existing (used) building (and
        equipment if purchased as part of the building purchase)
        or equal to 100% of the purchase price of structures
        within the two year period after the later of the date of
        purchase or the date the bonds are issued. Used equipment
        can not be bond financed at all, unless purchased as part
        of the plant which is simultaneously purchased. Some bond
        counsel will allow purchase of used equipment if 100%
        rehabilitation is represented.</p>
        <p>G. &quot;Certain Prohibited Uses&quot; of such bond
        proceeds exist, which include any airplanes, sky box,
        health club, gambling establishment and liquor store and
        in addition for QSIBs, any commercial golf course,
        country club, massage parlor, tennis club, skating
        facility, racquet sport facility, hot tub facility,
        suntan facility or race track.</p>
        <p>H. &quot;Public Approval Requirements&quot; must be
        met under both state and federal law. This means a notice
        of public hearing must be published in appropriate
        newspapers at least fourteen days prior to the date set
        for a public hearing on the issue, which notice sets
        forth the name of the issue and company, the project
        description and location, the dollar amount to be issued
        and the date, time and place set for the hearing. Such
        notices must be published in the jurisdiction where the
        project is to be located which may mean it has to be
        published in the host jurisdiction as well as in the
        jurisdiction of the issuer if that is remote. The project
        description must be more defined than the &quot;Official
        Intent&quot; description and issuers must be careful to
        not change the project and use of proceeds once the
        publication has been made. There are special rules for
        certain types of issues such as airports which may
        straddle multiple jurisdictions.</p>
        <p>I. &quot;Financing of Issuance Costs&quot; with the
        proceeds of such bonds is restricted to not more than two
        percent (2%) of the proceeds of the issue and such 2% is
        considered to be part of the 5% insubstantial portion of
        the bond issue that is not required to be aqualifying
        cost.</p>
        <p>J. &quot;Arbitrage Rules and Regulations&quot; apply
        to all such bonds, the basic thrust of which is to
        prevent the issuer and the company from keeping any
        positive arbitrage (the differential between the lower
        tax exempt yield on the bonds and any higher yield on the
        investment of the bond proceeds pending the disbursement
        thereof for costs) except during certain allowed
        temporary periods. </p>
        <p>K. &quot;Bond Registration&quot; is required of all
        such bonds, i.e., that they be issued inregistered form
        with the names of the bond owners in the Trustee's bond
        register (and not in the form of bearer bonds), but
        certain book-entry forms of registration are allowed.</p>
        <p>L. &quot;Federal Guarantees&quot; of such bonds is
        prohibited with certain exceptions.</p>
        <p>M. &quot;Advance Refunding&quot; of such bonds with
        tax exempt bonds is prohibited. Must use proceeds of
        refunding bonds within 90 days of issuance for it to be a
        current refunding, which means an allowed redemption of
        the old bonds must be available in that time frame.
        However, defeasance with nonbond proceeds is usually
        allowed under the documents . </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Par. 9. Section 1.1394-l is added under the heading
        &quot;DEFINlTIONS; SPECIAL RULES&quot; to read as
        follows:</p>
        <p>1.1394-1 Enterprise zone facility bonds.</p>
        <p><b><i>(a) Scope.</i></b> This section contains rules
        relating to section 1394, relating to tax-exempt bonds
        for enterprise zone facilities (enterprise zone facility
        bonds). See sections 1394, 1397B, and 1397C for other
        rules and definitions. </p>
        <p><a name="compl"></a></p>
        <p><b><i>(b) Continuing compliances -- </i></b></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph
            (b)(2) of this section, compliance with the
            requirements applicable to enterprise zone facility
            bonds apply throughout the term of the bonds.</p>
            <p>(2) Start-up period. For a qualified business that
            is first established in connection with the isssuance
            of enterprise zone facility bonds (as opposed to a
            continuing qualified business to which financing is
            provided), the requirements relating to qualification
            as an enterprise zone business and satisfaction of
            the rules for qualified zone property do not apply
            prior to the date that is one year after the later of
            the issue date of the bonds and the date the financed
            facility is placed in service (the testing date).</p>
            <p>(3) Manner of continuing compliance. An issue is
            treated as continuing to comply with the requirements
            of section 1394(a) and (b) if- </p>
            <blockquote>
                <dl>
                    <dt>(i) The issuer and each principal user in
                        good faith attempts to meet these
                        requirements throughout the term of the
                        bonds; and</dt>
                    <dt>(ii) Any failure to meet these
                        requirements is corrected within a
                        reasonable period after the failure is
                        first discovered. </dt>
                </dl>
            </blockquote>
            <p>(4) Good faith. In order to satisfy the good faith
            requirement of paragraph (b)(3) (i) of this section,
            the issuer and each principal user must satisfy the
            requirements of 1.141-13(a) (relating to conditions
            to taking remedial actions). For this purpose,
            reasonable procedures to ensure compliance with the
            requirements of section 1394(a) and (b) include a
            requirement that, at least annually, each principal
            user submit to the issuer information demonstrating
            its monitoring of compliance with these requirements.</p>
            <p>(5) Reasonable period to correct noncompliance.
            Noncompliance that is corrected within one year of
            discovery satisfies the requirement of paragraph
            (b)(3)(ii) of this section if, during the period in
            which the noncompliance exists, the issuer and the
            principal user use their best efforts to correct the
            noncompliance. </p>
            <p>(6) Application to employee requirements. For
            purposes of the requirement of section 1397B(b)(6)
            and (c)(5) that at least 35 percent of the employees
            are residents of the empowerment zone or enterprise
            community, the issuer and each principal user may
            rely on an employee certification, signed under the
            penalty of perjury in connection with the hiring of
            that employee, regarding the residence of the
            employee provided-</p>
            <blockquote>
                <dl>
                    <dt>(i) The employee is made aware of the
                        geographic boundaries of that zone or
                        community; </dt>
                    <dt>(ii) The employee is required to notify
                        the employer of a change of residence;
                        and</dt>
                    <dt>(iii) Neither the issuer nor the relevant
                        principal user has actual knowledge to
                        the contrary.</dt>
                </dl>

            <p>(7) Application to gross income requirements. For
            purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the
            requirement of section 1397B(b)(2) or (c)(l)
            continues to be treated as satisfied for each 5-year
            period during which, on the average, at least 85
            percent of the total gross income of the enterprise
            zone business is derived from the active conduct of
            that business if-</p>
            <blockquote>
                <dl>
                    <dt>(i) The requirements of paragraph
                        (b)(3)(i) of this section are satisfied;
                        and</dt>
                    <dt>(ii) The requirement of section
                        1397B(b)(2) or (c)(1) is satisfied during
                        each of the first 3 years after the
                        testing date.</dt>

        <p><b><i>(c) Limitation on amount of bonds-</i></b></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>(1) Determination of outstanding amount. Whether
            an issue satisfies the requirements of section
            1394(c) (relating to the $3 million and $20 million
            aggregate limitations on the amount of outstanding
            enterprise zone facility bonds) is determined as of
            the issue date of that issue based on the issue price
            of that issue and the adjusted issue price of
            outstanding bonds. </p>
            <p>(2) Loans-to-lenders programs. Whether an issue
            satisfies thc requirements of section 1394(c) may be
            determined without regard to the amount of bonds
            allocable to lenders in a loans-to-lenders program.
            This paragraph (c)(2) applies only if the proceeds of
            those bonds are loaned to an enterprise zone business
            within 42 months of the issue date of the bonds or,
            to the extent not so used, are used to redeem bonds
            of the issue within that 42 month period. A
            loans-to-lenders program is a program in which the
            issuer of enterprise zone facility bonds, in order to
            provide loans to enterprise zone businesses, lends
            the proceeds of the bonds to a bank or similar
            intermediary which must then relend the proceeds to
            enterprise zone businesses.</p>

            within the empowerment zone, whether or not that use
            corresponds to the use of that property by the
            taxpayer. However, for purposes of section 1394,
            property that has been abandoned for a period in
            excess of one year is treated as satisfying the
            requirement of section 1397C(a)(1)(B),
            notwithstanding that the date of abandonment occurred
            before the date on which the designation of the
            empowerment zone took effect. See, however,

        <h2>Specific Comments on the Application of the Proposed
        Regulations to Enterprise Zone Facility Bonds </h2>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Proposed Treasury Regulations 1.1394-1: Enterprise Zone
    Facility Bonds </h3>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Proposed Treasury Regulation section 1.1394-1,
        regarding Enterprise Zone Facility Bonds (the
        &quot;Proposed Regulations&quot;), provides some guidance
        and clarity with respect to Sections 1394, 1397B and
        1397C of the Code (the &quot;EZFB Provisions&quot;),
        which EZFB Provisions impose numerous difficult tests in
        order to meet the requirements of the definitions of
        enterprise zone facility, qualified zone property and
        enterprise zone business. Notwithstanding the guidance
        and clarity provided by the Proposed Regulations, it is
        respectfully submitted that the final enterprise zone
        regulations (the &quot;Final Regulations&quot;) should
        further enhance implementation of the EZBF Provisions if
        the Congressional aspirations for enterprise communities
        are going to be even modestly achieved. We believe that
        the suggestions and clarifications set forth below would
        follow the legislative intent of Congress and are within
        the language of the Code. As currently drafted, the EZBF
        Provisions and the Proposed Regulations make tax-exempt
        enterprise zone facility bonds (&quot;Enterprise
        Bonds&quot;) unlikely to provide much help to many
        otherwise valid business opportunities for enterprise
        communities.</p>
        <p>The Internal Revenue Service may wish to consider the
        comments outlined below in the broader context of how
        such comments would also enhance the empowerment zone
        employment credit program and the empowerment zone
        expensing allowance authorized under Code Sections 1396
        and 1397A, respectively. Failure to address the
        definitional problems to be discussed herein will also
        limit the viability of the employment credit and
        expensing allowance programs.</p>
        <p>Unless otherwise indicated, section references
        beginning with 1.1394-1 are to the Proposed Regulations
        and section references beginning with 1391 through 1397C
        are to the Code. </p>

    <h4>Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.1394-l(b)(l): Good
    Faith Period Alternative to Continuous Compliance</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Under Prop. Treas. Reg. 1.1394-l(b)(1), continuing
        compliance with the requirements applicable to enterprise
        zone facility bonds generally is required throughout the
        term of the bonds: various exceptions are provided. We
        suggest an alternative, and more feasible, approach that
        would depart from the requirement that there be
        continuous compliance with all of the requirements
        applicable to Enterprise Bonds throughout the term of the
        bonds. Under the alternative approach, only a five-year
        &quot;good faith period&quot; would be required
        (following an appropriate start-up period discussed
        below) in lieu of continuous compliance. Compliance with
        the numerous requirements of the Code throughout the term
        of the bonds, tested annually as proposed by the Proposed
        Regulations, will significantly diminish the possibility
        of achieving the presumed Congressional intent of
        encouraging growth and expansion of business and
        employment of persons living within enterprise
        communities.</p>
        <p>For example, section 1397(b)(2), which requires 80
        percent of the total gross income of an enterprise zone
        business to be derived from the active conduct of
        business in an enterprise community, will become a major
        obstacle to a business that becomes successful and seeks
        to develop a larger business base outside of the
        enterprise community. Development of such
        &quot;outside&quot; business could cause the successful
        business enterprise to exceed the 80 percent limitation,
        thereby losing its qualification as a qualified
        enterprise zone business. If the Internal Revenue Service
        considers a five-year &quot;good faith&quot; period to be
        too short, we propose that the &quot;good faith
        period&quot; be set at ten years, that would make it
        coterminous with the initial enterprise community
        designation. If the Service rejects the &quot;good faith
        period&quot; approach, adoption of the specific
        implementing changes set forth below becomes even more
        critical if Enterprise Bonds are going to be a viable
        financing vehicle. </p>

    <h4><b>Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.1394-1(b)(2):
    Start-up Period for Compliance</b></h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It is respectfully suggested that a start-up period
        for compliance with the various requirements be extended
        to 1 and 1/2 years and not be limited solely to startup
        businesses. Limiting the start-up compliance period to
        start-up businesses appears to serve little purpose
        because the extensive EZBF Provisions and regulatory
        requirements will be as onerous for an established
        business as they will be for a startup business. Creation
        of a reasonable start-up compliance period for
        established businesses would help avoid unintended
        results such as the replacement of current employees who
        are non-residents of the enterprise community with
        employees who are residents in order to comply with the
        rule. Furthermore, existing businesses wi11 be the more
        viable candidates for enterprise zone financing. Thus,
        unnecessary barriers such as unworkable compliance
        periods should be removed if the Congressional intent of
        encouraging economic growth within enterprise communities
        is going to be achieved. </p>

        <p>Is the term &quot;principal user&quot; intended to

        requirement that all principal users make a good faith
        effort to meet the requirements may be too onerous, given
        the fact that &quot;principal user&quot; in the small
        issue context has been interpreted to include principal
        customers. Such a result probably was not intended by
        Congress, because it affects a business's qualification
        as a qualified enterprise zone business if one (or more)
        of its larger customers fails to satisfy the EZBF
        Provisions. Assuming Congress did not intend these
        provisions to apply to an enterprise zone business's
        customers, a clarification that a more limited definition
        for &quot;principal user&quot; in this context was
        intended, would be helpful.</p>

    <h4><b>Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.1394-l (b)(6):
    Changes Implementing Compliance with the 35 Percent
    Employment Rule</b></h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p>We commend the Service for the clarity it brings to
        the mechanics for documenting compliance with the
        requirements of Code Sections 1397B(b)(6) and (c)(5) that
        at least 35 percent of the employees of an enterprise
        zone business be residents of the enterprise community.
        However, if enterprise zone financing is going to have
        any chance of achieving the Congressional objectives,
        further implementing changes must be made. The 35 percent
        employment requirement is extremely onerous, considering
        the demographic requirements that areas must meet in
        order to qualify as enterprise communities. Because of
        the geographical size limitations and poverty level
        requirements, enterprise communities will not be fertile
        employment pools. It will be very difficult for a
        well-intentioned enterprise zone business to achieve
        initially and maintain thereafter, the 35 percent
        employment level. Thus, implementing changes within the
        word and spirit of Code Sections 1397B(b)(6) and (c)(5)
        are critical if Enterprise Bond financing is going to be
        a viable financing vehicle.</p>
        <p>We propose that compliance with the 35 percent
        employment rule be established by permitting an
        enterprise zone business to meet the 35 percent test on
        an average basis for rolling 5-year periods. Thus, the
        test would be met if, during each 5-year period, an
        average of 35 percent of a business's employees live
        within the enterprise community. This averaging concept
        would follow the approach used in Prop. Treas. Reg.
        1.1394-1(b)(7) with respect to the 80% gross income
        requirement in sections 1397B(b)(2) and (c)(1). If such
        averaging approach is rejected, we believe that the
        specific implementing changes proposed below would be
        necessary as alternative means to achieve compliance with
        the rule.</p>
        <p>In amplification of the 1 l/2 year start-up period
        discussed above, it is suggested that an enterprise zone
        business be given at least 11/2 years to come into
        initial compliance with the 35 percent employment test.
        After an enterprise zone business has initially complied
        with the 35 percent employment requirement, it is
        proposed that the enterprise zone business be considered
        to be in compliance when employees who initially live
        within the enterprise community move from the enterprise
        community, so long as such employees continue to be
        employed by the enterprise zone business at its business
        location in the enterprise community. It is further
        suggested that if employees who were initially part of
        the 35 percent qualifying pool leave the employment of
        the enterprise zone business, the enterprise zone
        business be deemed to be in compliance so long as the
        positions that have been vacated are held open and made
        available for at least 6 months to persons living within
        the enterprise community. The model for this approach can
        be found in section 143(h) of the Code, which deals with
        compliance with the low and moderate income multi-family
        housing project requirements. An alternative approach
        would be to treat a business as in compliance with this
        rule so long as the next employees it hires live within
        the enterprise community. The model for this approach can
        be found in section 142(d)(3) of the Code (compliance
        with tenant income limitations for low and moderate
        income multi-family housing, project financing) and
        section 42(g)(2) of the Code (low income housing credit).</p>
        <p>The House Committee report with respect to Section
        1397B provides that the Treasury Secretary will prescribe
        regulations to determine appropriate treatment for
        part-time employees for purposes of calculating the 35
        percent employment rule. The Proposed Regulations do not
        address such question. It is proposed that the Final
        Regulations provide that part-time employees who live in
        the enterprise community and who work at least 50 percent
        of what is certified to be a normal work week for
        employees in their job classification be counted towards
        compliance with the 35 percent employment test. </p>

    <h4><b>Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.1394-l(b)(7):
    Changes Implementing Compliance with the 80 Percent Gross
    Income Rule</b></h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p>We commend the Internal Revenue Service for its
        recognition of the need to enhance the taxpayers' ability
        to comply with the very demanding 80 percent rule by
        proposing a five-year averaging approach. It is
        respectfully proposed, however, that the five-year
        average requirement of 85 percent be reduced to 80
        percent. Because the 80-percent provision will be very
        difficult to comply with as a result of the inherent
        economic negatives of an enterprise community, a more
        realistic implementation would be to set the five-year
        averaging percentage at 80 percent. The fact that the
        Code sets the percentage at 80 percent makes this change
        reasonable.</p>
        <p>A more fundamental issue with respect to the 80
        percent gross revenue requirements of sections
        1397B(b)(1) and (c)(1) arises in the construction of the
        language requiring that at least 80 percent of the total
        gross income of the business entity or proprietorship be
        derived from the &quot;active conduct&quot; of such
        business in an enterprise community. It will be extremely
        difficult for any business entity or proprietorship to
        comply with this requirement unless the Final Regulations
        provide an implementing construction of the term
        &quot;active conduct&quot;. Although it is understandable
        why Congress might have felt that a provision limiting
        the availability of such bonds to businesses conducted
        primarily within an enterprise community might be
        desirable, the ensuing restriction on growth caused by
        such provision should be obvious. If a business that is
        started within an enterprise community becomes successful
        and continues to expand, will its growth have to be
        stunted at the boundaries of the enterprise community in
        order to comply with such provision? For example, if a
        business (e.g., a messenger or courier service) is
        contained within an enterprise community, but the growth
        of the business requires deliveries to customers outside
        of the enterprise community, should the designation as a
        &quot;qualified business&quot; require the rejection of
        business that would be conducted elsewhere? Such a rule
        seems to create an illogical obstacle to the natural
        growth and profitability of a business enterprise.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, there are certain businesses that, while
        located physically within an enterprise community, may,
        by their very nature, engage in business that takes them
        outside of the enterprise community. Some examples of
        these types of businesses are trucking and/or moving
        companies, livery services and courier services.
        Similarly, if an architectural or construction firm
        locates within an enterprise community, should that
        business be penalized if some of its customers desire
        work to be done outside the enterprise community? Can
        Congress really have intended to put such shackles on
        small businesses located within an enterprise community?</p>
        <p>It is recommended that the Final Regulations define
        the &quot;active conduct&quot; of business in such a way
        as to allow an enterprise zone business to conduct
        business and derive revenues outside of the enterprise
        community, so long as the business entity or
        proprietorship is physically located within the
        enterprise community and satisfies the 35 percent
        employee-residence requirement. Although conducting an
        enterprise zone business in an enterprise community may
        not be difficult for supermarkets or other retail
        establishments, many businesses will be significantly
        constrained if they have to derive 80 percent of their
        revenues from business physically conducted in an
        enterprise community that is inherently a small
        geographic area and a poor market. Any regulation
        permitting enhanced implementation of the requirements of
        the rule would be extremely helpful.</p>
        <p>The Final Regulations should provide that the
        &quot;active conduct&quot; of business includes such
        business that occurs and generates revenue from outside
        of the enterprise community so long as the business
        originates within the enterprise community (e.g.,
        couriers, services businesses, such as furnace sales and
        installation businesses and the like). </p>

        requirements of sections 1394(a) and (b) is required
        within a reasonable period after the failure is

        the Final Regulations clarify how a failure to satisfy
        the 80 percent gross income rule can be corrected. If an

        meet this test, but, after the applicable 5-year
        averaging period the percentage has been slightly
        exceeded, what is the result? Does the business lose its
        qualification as an enterprise zone business? Must the
        business disgorge itself of enough of its non-zone income
        to get itself to the 80 percent level? Guidance on this
        point would be extremely helpful. </p>

    <h4><b>Proposed TreasuryRegulation Section 1.1394-l(c)(2):
    Clarification of Public Approval Compliance for
    Loans-to-Lenders Programs</b></h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It is proposed that the Final Regulations expressly
        set forth the method for compliance with the public
        approval requirement in the loans-to-lenders program. The
        broad cross-reference to sections 141 to 150 of the Code,
        and the regulations therefore, in Prop. Treas. Reg.
        1.1394-l(f)(1) and (f)(4) do not provide the clarity
        needed for achieving compliance with the public approval
        requirement in a loans-to-lenders program. It is proposed
        that the Final Regulations clearly state that in a
        loans-to-lenders pool bond program the public approval
        requirement may be complied with in one of two ways.
        First, where none of the potential borrowers are known at
        the time of publication and hearing, a general
        description of the program and the expected borrower
        criteria could be published. The model for this approach
        may be found in the public hearing requirements for
        student loan bond financings and mortgage revenue bond
        financings. Because the loans-to-lenders provisions
        contain a 42-month rule similar to the one contained in
        Code Section 143(a)(2)(D) (applicable to loans made with
        proceeds of mortgage revenue bonds), reference to the
        public approval requirements applicable to mortgage
        revenue bonds seems reasonable. Second, where some of the
        potential borrowers are known at the time of publication
        and hearing, the &quot;known&quot; borrowers and projects
        could be published initially, and subsequent publications
        of notice and public hearings may occur as additional
        borrowers and projects become known and before the
        subsequent loans are made. In the <u>General Explanation
        of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 </u>(the &quot;1986 Blue
        Book&quot;), the Staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation
        recognized that identification of borrowers prior to bond
        issuance is not possible and therefore, should not be
        necessary in all cases. In fact, the 1986 Blue Book
        indicated that Congress intended regulations to be
        amended to reflect those types of issues (e.g., student
        loan bonds, mortgage revenue bonds and 501(c)(3) bonds)
        where such pre-issuance identification should not be
        required. The same reasoning applies to the
        loans-to-lenders program for Enterprise Bonds. </p>

    <h4><b>Proposed TreasuryRegulation Section 1.1394-l(c):
    Clarification of Bond Amount Limitations</b></h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Two points of clarification are proposed. First, in
        section 1394(c)(2), it seems clear that Congress intended
        a specific cross-reference to subsection (C) of section
        144(a)( 10) of the Code, which deals with the rules
        regarding the allocation of the face amount of bond
        issues for facilities used by multiple users, rather than
        all facets of section 144(a)(10) of the Code.
        Clarification of the intent of that cross reference would
        be helpful.</p>
        <p>Second, clarification is requested as to whether the
        approach to be used for purposes of section 1394(c)(1)(A)
        in counting the aggregate amount of outstanding
        Enterprise Bonds would be appropriate for purposes of
        complying with the $20 million limitation of section
        1394(c)(1)(B), notwithstanding the fact that section
        1394(c)(2) only states that such approach should be used
        for purposes of the $3 million limitation.</p>
        <p>With regard to Prop. Treas. Reg. 1.1394-1(c)(1), an
        example of the &quot;adjusted issue price&quot; of
        outstanding bonds would be helpful. We commend the
        Internal Revenue Service for clarifying that the test is
        based on the issue price of the issue, but there is
        uncertainty as to what is intended by the term
        &quot;adjusted issue price.&quot; If the definition is
        intended to be the same as that contained in the
        &quot;original issue discount&quot; regulations, such
        clarification would be welcomed.</p>

    <h4><b>Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.1394-l (d)(1):
    Changes Clarifying and Implementing Compliance With Original
    Use Requirement</b></h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p>An example of the original use requirement in the
        qualified zone property definition would be helpful. It
        would appear from the language in the Proposed
        Regulations that the financing of used machinery and
        equipment that is later moved into an enterprise
        community is permitted, so long as such machinery and
        equipment was acquired after the creation of the
        enterprise community and after passage of an inducement
        resolution, regardless of taxpayers previous use of the
        machinery and equipment. A simple example would clarify
        that understanding.</p>
        <p>Another point deals with the abandoned property
        exception. The term &quot;abandoned&quot; implies
        cessation of private ownership, as distinguished from
        being merely &quot;out of use.&quot; Also, the exception
        fails to address the most common distressed property
        scenario in economically failing areas, i.e., retail
        shopping facilities and malls, that are only vestigially
        in use. Furthermore, it is submitted that the requirement
        that property must have been abandoned for a full year is
        an unnecessarily tough test for under-utilized property
        to qualify for the exception to the original use
        requirement. Therefore, it is respectfully suggested that
        a defined term &quot;substantially out of use&quot; be
        used and that the definition mean &quot;at least 80
        percent unoccupied for a period of six-months, or
        longer.&quot; In the alternative, it would be helpful to
        obtain clarification that the occupied portion of a
        largely unused facility could be allocated as a
        non-qualifying portion of the facility so that the
        portion of the facility that has not been in use for over
        six months could qualify as qualified zone property, so
        long as it meets the other tests. Lastly, a clarification
        of what the cross reference in Prop. Treas. Reg.
        1.1394-l(d)(1) to &quot;section 1.103-8(a)(5)&quot; is
        intended to incorporate, would be helpful. </p>

    <h4><b>Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.1394-l (d)(2):
    Changes Implementing Compliance With Qualified Zone Property
    and Enterprise Zone Business Definitions </b></h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It is respectfully suggested that use of &quot;90
        percent&quot; as the definition for &quot;substantially
        all&quot; in this context is inappropriate and unduly
        burdensome. The percentage appears to be borrowed from
        the &quot;substantially all&quot; rule with respect to
        the use of the proceeds of bonds issued under the
        Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as illustrated in the
        regulations applicable thereto. In the context of the
        amount of bond proceeds to be used for specifically
        permitted projects, 90 percent has some logic and does
        not effectively inhibit the legislative intent of
        Congress. In the context of the definitions of qualified
        zone property and an enterprise zone business,
        application of a &quot;90 percent&quot; threshold will
        effectively preclude the financing of many of the types
        of businesses that could succeed in enterprise
        communities. Section 1397B(b), subsections (3), (4) and
        (5) and section 1397B(c), subsections (2), (3) and (4),
        as expanded by the Proposed Regulations, would require
        that 90 percent of the use of the tangible and intangible
        personal property be within the enterprise community and
        that 90 percent of the services be performed within the
        enterprise community. This requirement would essentially
        preclude the financing of many businesses that rely upon
        mobile equipment, businesses involved in local deliveries
        and businesses involved in service (whether it be furnace
        installations, appliance repairs, courier services,
        architectural services, etc.). In order to succeed and
        expand, such types of businesses will have to operate and
        derive revenue outside of the relatively small geographic
        area of an enterprise community and from markets that
        have the means to pay for the services and/or products
        offered by the enterprise zone business. Enterprise
        communities are statutorily required to be areas that are
        geographically small and economically poor.</p>
        <p>Requiring enterprise zone businesses to use 90 percent
        of their tangible and intangible personal property and to
        deliver 90 percent of their services within the
        enterprise community will essentially limit enterprise
        zone businesses to retail operations and some
        manufacturing businesses. Moreover, even such retail
        operations will find it difficult to succeed given the
        level of poverty an area must possess in order to quaiify
        as an enterprise community. Presumably, the purpose of
        Enterprise Bonds is to create job opportunities and add
        to the tax base by causing businesses to locate in, and
        eventually grow within, those enterprise communities. The
        90 percent rules will work at cross-purposes to the
        creation of many potentially successful enterprise zone
        businesses.</p>
        <p>The same observations apply equally with respect to
        the use of a 90 percent definition for
        &quot;substantially all&quot; as it appears in section
        1397C(a)(l)(C). That section requires that
        &quot;substantially all&quot; of the use of qualified
        zone property be in an enterprise community and in the
        active conduct of a qualified business by the taxpayer in
        such community. </p>

    <h4><b>Proposed Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1394-169(1)
    and 69(4): Clarification of Code Section and Regulations
    Incorporated by Reference</b> </h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It is helpful that the IRS has attempted to limit the
        number of new definitions and regulations applicable to
        Enterprise Bonds by incorporating existing and relatively
        well understood rules and regulations. However, it is
        respectfully suggested that the incorporation by
        reference of sections 141-l50 of the Code and the
        regulations applicable thereto is too all inclusive and
        creates some confusion. Thus, it would be helpful if the
        Final Regulations establish specifically which sections
        are applicable (or, in the alternative, which are not).
        For example, sections 143, 144 and 145 seem to be
        entirely inapplicable except for the one incorporation by
        reference of section 144(a)(10)&quot;(C)&quot; (see
        discussion, above). </p>

    <h4><b>Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.1394-l(f)(l):
    Clarification of Applicability of Office Space Limitation</b></h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It is helpful that clarification has been provided
        that Enterprise Bonds are treated as exempt facility
        bonds that are described in section 142(a) of the Code.
        However, Prop. Treas. Reg. 1.1394-l(f)(l) and (f)(4)
        incorporate by reference, sections 141-150 of the Code
        and the regulations thereto in their entirety, creating
        ambiguity as to whether the limitations on financing
        office space as set forth in section 142(d) of the Code
        would apply to Enterprise Bond facilities. The office
        space limitation should not apply, because it is clear
        Congress did not intend to limit enterprise zone
        businesses in the same way that exempt facilities and
        qualified small issue facilities are limited. This point
        further illustrates the ambiguity and confusion that is
        created by the overly inclusive cross-references to
        sections 141 through 150 of the Code and the regulations
        thereunder.</p>

        <h4><b>Section 1397B(d)(5)(B): Necessary Clarification of
        Small Farm Business Exception</b></h4>
        <p>The Final Regulations should not require compliance
        with the $500,000 limitation on farm business size on a
        year-by-year basis because a mere rise in market value of
        a taxpayer's assets could jeopardize the tax exemption
        for interest on any outstanding Enterprise Bonds. It is
        proposed that compliance be determined at the time of
        issue or in the alternative, that compliance be required
        for a minimum finite period, such as five years,
        beginning on the date of issue. Annual testing would
        unduly jeopardize the tax-exemption of the interest on
        the Enterprise Bonds and unduly constrain a small farm
        operation from succeeding and becoming a larger farm
        operation. </p>
