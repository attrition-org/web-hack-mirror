        <td valign="top" width="180"><h3>What is Franchising</h3>
        <p>Franchising is a partnership between franchisor and
        franchisee where franchisor provides expertise on a
        proven business plan. This expertise is normally
        transmitted through training and ongoing support. The
        franchisee brings to the table motivation - the best
        motivation for a successful business which is private
        ownership.</p>
        <p>In very general terms, a franchise exists if one party
        grants another the right to distribute services, while
        using the grantor's trademark, logo, trade name,
        commercial symbol or advertising. In addition, the
        grantor prescribes a marketing plan or allows the
        franchisee to be involved in group distribution. Payment
        is made for the right to become or remain a distributor
        or dealer, above and beyond the wholesale price of
        initial inventory or goods.</p>

        <td valign="top" width="400"><h3>Why Franchising</h3>
        <p>A franchise is normally a proven way of doing
        business. Even though it is not a guaranteed formula for
        success, much has been written and there is additional
        research that has been done to support the concept that
        it is very often economically advantageous to capitalize
        on someone else's game plan and not have to spend time
        and money reinventing the wheel.</p>
        <p>A franchise system most often provides a security
        blanket of working with an expert while still maintaining
        one's independence of being one's own boss. The extent of
        independence depends on the type of franchise one
        purchases and should be evaluated in light of one's
        individual personality based upon how much free
        expression as opposed to how much control the franchisee
        would feel comfortable with.</p>
        <p>A franchise normally provides training and ongoing
        support and therefore previous experience is not normally
        necessary. There are however exceptions to this general
        rule.</p>
        <p>According to the <a href="http://www.entremkt.com/ifa">International
        Franchise Association</a> (IFA), Franchising constituted
        over $800 billion dollars in sales in 1992 and sales are
        estimated to reach $1 trillion dollars by the year 2000.
        Currently, over 40% of all retail sales are made by
        franchise companies and 1 out of every 12 business
        establishments is a franchise. No wonder the Department
        of Commerce has called franchising &quot;the leading
        method of doing business in the 1990's.&quot;</p>
        <p>What makes franchising such a popular way for
        entrepreneurs to go into business? 94% of franchisees
        reported their own franchise operation to be successful
        as reported by a Gallop survey. A new franchise opens
        every 8 minutes of each business day! <br>
