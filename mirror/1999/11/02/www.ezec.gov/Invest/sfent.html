<P><B>What is the Enterprise Community Program?</B></P>
<P>San Francisco's Enterprise Community program stems from the Empowerment
Zone/Enterprise (EZ/EC) Community Program, a national competition created by the
Clinton Administration last year. In essence, the EZ/EC program is about
revitalizing low income neighborhoods, supporting grassroots and community-based
planning, creating new partnerships between neighborhoods, local government and
the federal government.</P>
<P>The key principles of the EZ/EC program include:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><DL><DT>Economic Opportunity</DT>
<DT>Sustainable Community Development</DT>
<DT>Community-Based Partnerships</DT>
<DT>Strategic Visions for Change</DT></DL></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Clinton Administration advised local communities that only 6 urban
cities would receive Empowerment Zone status, while 65 urban cities could
receive Enterprise Community status. In order to qualify, certain
economic/demographic requirements had to be met, and the competing cities had to
submit innovative and comprehensive strategic plans for revitalization of the
targeted areas.</P>
<P><B>How San Francisco Got Enterprise Community Designation?</B></P>
<UL><LI>Because of San Francisco's unique demographics and economic
composition, and because of the City's desire to be as inclusive as possible, we
were able to apply for Enterprise Community (EC) status for six neighborhoods,
Bayview-Hunter's Point, Visitacion Valley, the Mission, South of Market,
Chinatown and the Tenderloin.  Because of federal regulations, we had to split
our application into two, with the first four neighborhoods comprising one
application and Chinatown and the Tenderloin the other.<WBR><BR><BR></LI>
<LI>San Francisco's application consisted of ten year strategic plans/visions
for each of the six neighborhoods. The strategic plans were developed through
one of the most extensive neighborhood-based planning processes in the history
of the City. Widely publicized meetings were held in all six neighborhoods over
a two month period. More than 700 individuals participated in 13 meetings in the
various neighborhoods. More than 500 public and private entities are represented
in the plans, and City departments were active collaborators in the process as
well.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI>Each neighborhood's plans built on the principles outlined above, and
looked specifically at the areas of economic development, housing, public
safety, education and training, physical environment, and human services. The
application also called for the creation of an Enterprise Community Council,
with representation from each neighborhood, City officials, and private funders,
to oversee implementation of the strategic plans.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI>As a result of our inclusive process and the quality of the strategic plans
submitted to HUD, San Francisco received official Enterprise Community
designation in late December, 1994. The official designation only covered the
four neighborhoods of Visitacion Valley, Bayview-Hunter's Point, the Mission and
South of Market.  However, HUD has advised us that they understand our EC
program to consist of the six neighborhoods (though some of the benefits can
only go to the four formally designated areas). San Francisco is committed to
working with all six of the neighborhoods in the implementation of their
strategic plans.</LI></UL> 
<P><B>What Does Enterprise Community Designation Mean?</B></P>
<UL><LI>With designation come some very specific new resources: </LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><DL><DT>$2.95 million in Social Service Block Grant
funds;  
</DT>
<DT>Tax exempt bonds (up to $3 million per business); </DT>
<DT>Preferences for a wide variety of other federal grant competitions; and 
</DT>
<DT>$3 million in matching funds from the Local Support Initiatives Corporation
(LISC), and pledges of support from other funders and organizations, including
the Equal Opportunity Council (EOC).</DT></DL></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL><LI>In addition, many City agencies and departments are integrating the
Enterprise Community strategic plans into their decision-making process for
existing resources.</LI></UL>
<P><B>What's Next?</B></P>
<UL><LI>Each neighborhood is now in the process of refining and prioritizing
their strategic plans. By fall of 1995, specific programs and projects that meet
the neighborhood-determined priorities and objectives will be solicited by each
neighborhood for submission to the Enterprise Community Board.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI>Each of the six neighborhoods has three representatives on the 25-person EC
Board. In addition, there is representation from private funders, a few City
departments and related agencies, the Mayor's Office and the Board of
Supervisors. The EC Board is the policy and decision-making body whose job it is
to help each neighborhood implement their strategic plans by matching available
resources to specific proposals.</LI></UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P>TO: San Francisco Enterprise Community Board</P>
<P>FROM: Monica Wilson, SKMG</P>
<P>DATE: September 20, 1995</P>
<P>SUBJECT: Summary of Funding Principles from the September and July
Enterprise Community Board Meetings</P>
<P>This memorandum provides a summary of the San Francisco Enterprise Community
Board's discussion about funding principles at the September Board meeting. The
September Board meeting was dedicated to the completion of the funding
principles discussion, focusing on the four remaining issues: Equity, Funding
Cycles, Minimum Funds Threshold/Maximum Impacts; and Existing vs. New Programs.
</P>
<P>In addition, information concerning the three funding principles categories
discussed at the July Board Meeting, Inter-Neighborhood Collaboration,
Leveraging Resources, and Existing Agency Linkages have been included.</P>
<P>Again, please review this summary and the attached graphic records to ensure
that the Board's consensus was appropriately documented. Also, please be
prepared with recommendations from your neighborhood to address the possible
development of neighborhood- specific funding principles. As we discussed, we
anticipate that each neighborhood will individually tailor a more detailed set
of funding principles unique to the neighborhood's needs (e.g., minimum Funds
Threshold/Maximum Impacts).</P>
<P>INTER-NEIGHBORHOOD COLLABORATION</P>
<UL><LI>Fund neighborhood priority programs that demonstrate and encourage
inter-neighborhood collaboration and shared resources.</LI></UL>
<P>LEVERAGING RESOURCES</P>
<UL><LI>Fund projects that promote and stimulate a sustainable neighborhood
economic base (e.g., linkages between business development and employment needs
of neighborhood residents; spin-off business opportunities generated for
neighborhood businesses; leveraging private sector funds or resources within the
neighborhood).</LI></UL>
<P>EQUITY</P>
<UL><LI>Allocate the Enterprise Community funds ($2.95 million) equally
between designated communities. Thus, the four designated communities will each
receive approximately $740,000 of Enterprise Community funds to invest in their
neighborhoods' priority programs.</LI>
<LI>Promote equity between the six communities and recommend to LISC that grant
and equity investment funds ($1.5 million) committed to San Francisco's
Enterprise Community's program are equally divided between Tenderloin and
Chinatown.  Thus, Tenderloin and Chinatown will each receive approximately
$740,000 in grants and equity investment funds.</LI></UL>
<P>EXISTING ORGANIZATIONAL LINKAGES</P>
<UL><LI>Provide preference to proposals that demonstrate linkage to
neighborhood organizations with meaningful resident representation and
involvement.</LI>
<LI>Require funding applicants to demonstrate or commit to ongoing
participation in the Neighborhood Planning Bodies.</LI>
<LI>Require funding applicants to demonstrate positive prior track record in
the neighborhood, based upon service standards created by each Neighborhood
Planning Body.</LI></UL>
<P>EXISTING VS. NEW PROGRAMS</P>
<UL><LI>Provide funding to proposals for existing and new organizations that
demonstrate competence and commitment to their communities, including the
meaningful representation by the community in their organization.</LI></UL>
<P>FUNDING CYCLES</P>
<UL><LI>Allocate the Enterprise Community funds in two cycles (January 1996
and fall 1996). 2</LI>
<LI>Promote the equal distribution of funds in each funding cycle (50 percent
January 1996 and 50 percent fall 1996). However, allow flexibility in the
distribution of funds to take into account projects that may require greater
up-front funding or one-time funding.</LI>
<LI>Request for continued funding during the second funding cycle, fall 1996,
will be evaluated based on the program's success in achieving its desired
outcomes and in the funding recipients' accountability to the community.</LI>
<LI>Promote a flexible allocation of funds. Specifically, allow short-term (one
funding cycle) programs to compete with programs seeking funding in both cycles.
</LI></UL> 
<P>MINIMUM FUNDS THRESHOLD/MAXIMUM IMPACT</P>
<UL><LI>Consensus was not reached on this funding principle. The issue of
setting a minimum funds threshold will be reviewed at the neighborhood level by
the Neighborhood Planning Bodies. Neighborhoods may agree to include a minimum
funds threshold as part of the development of neighborhood-specific funding
principles.</LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Today's workshop is intended to
inform you of the progress that has been made in the Enterprise Community
program since the last neighborhood meeting, and to get your feedback on the
proposals which your elected representatives are recommending should be
submitted for funding.</P>
<P>First, here are some important facts for you to know:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><DL><DT>Our neighborhood, as one of the four federally-designated
Enterprise Communities in San Francisco, is eligible to receive approximately
$740,000 in grant funds to support local projects.</DT>
<DT><BR><WBR>The monies will be allocated in two funding cycles: one begins
in March 1996, the other begins around September 1996.</DT>
<DT> <BR><WBR>Local organizations and groups will be invited to submit
proposals for these funds.</DT>
<DT> <BR><WBR>We are also eligible to receive a portion of the $50 million in
low-interest loans available to promote housing and business development in our
area.</DT></DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P></P>
<P>At previous Community meetings, we developed a list of &quot;benchmarks,&quot;
or goals for our neighborhood. In July, we voted on these benchmarks to see
which ones seemed to be the most critical to improving the Mission area.</P>
<P>Although every one of the goals is important, we know we can't fund them all
through the Enterprise Community program. We have to decide which of the
benchmarks are the most strategic -- those which will give us the most bang for
our buck, which will meet the needs identified by the community, and which are
most appropriate to the goals of the Enterprise Community program. And we have
to submit these to the Enterprise Community Board soon in order to ensure our
share of the funding.</P>
<P>Your elected representatives are proposing five projects to submit to the
Enterprise Community Board. Today, we want to discuss these proposals and get
your ideas for making them stronger before taking them to the Board.</P>

<HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="260" NOSHADE="NOSHADE">
<BLOCKQUOTE><P></P>
<P>Based on the criteria outlined on the previous page, the Mission Enterprise
Community elected representatives recommend the following projects for submittal
to the San Francisco Enterprise Community Board (numbers in parentheses refer to
the benchmark[s] incorporated in the proposed project):</P>
<P><B>PROPOSAL A: </B>Create an enterprise that employs youth to clean the
Mission's  streets and sidewalks on a regular basis and has as one of its goals
involving as many youth as possible in the management and ownership of the
business. Self-sufficiency within two years is an additional measure of success.
This project could be developed in conjunction with an existing business. (2c,
3, 6)</P>
<P><B>PROPOSAL B:</B> Establish a school retention program. This program would
create a model for Latino and Asian families targeted to keep youth, at risk of
dropping out, in school. Support services could include increasing parent
involvement in the school, case management for at-risk youth, assistance with
legal documentation, job training and parent support groups. The focus of the
program would be to comprehensively address school retention for at-risk youth.
(2b, 4)</P>
<P><B>PROPOSAL C:</B> Create a 24-hour childcare facility in the Mission
District. Allow  working parents with evening and weekend shifts to leave their
children in safe, licensed child care. (3, 4, 5)</P>
<P><B>PROPOSAL D:</B> Implement a strategy for the eventual purchase and
rehabilitation of all of the Mission's residential hotels by non-profit
entities. (1, 2c)
</P>
<P><B>PROPOSAL E:</B> Increase tourism and enhance cultural and historical
awareness by expanding existing mural tour programs. Create new positions for
paid youth guides and direct proceeds to the restoration and maintenance of this
Mission's murals. (3, 11a, 13)</P>
