        <b>Overview</b></p>
        <p>In hiring workers after September 30, 1996, employers
        will have a Federal tax incentive to employ individuals
        who are deemed to be disadvantaged for employment
        purposes under certain governmental guidelines. The Small
        Business Job Protection Act of 1996, signed into law on
        August 20th by President Clinton, provides a new Work
        Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC).</p>
        <p>The WOTC replaces the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC),
        which expired with respect to workers hired after
        December 31, 1994. The WOTC rules relating to eligible
        workers, credit rate, minimum employment period, and
        certification differ from the rules under the expired
        TJTC.</p>
        <p><a name="amtcredit"></a></p>
        <p align="center"><br>
        <b>Amount of the Credit</b></p>
        <p>Employers electing the WOTC may claim a credit of 35%
        of qualified first-year wages paid to an employee from
        one of the designated targeted groups (listed below).
        Generally, an employer may take into account the first
        $6,000 of a target-group employee's first-year wages, for
        a maximum credit of $2,100. For a qualified summer youth
        employee, an employer may take into account the first
        $3,000 of wages for up to 90 days between May 1 and
        September 15, for a maximum credit of $1,050. The
        first-year wage period generally starts on the first day
        the individual begins work for the employer.</p>

        <b>Targeted Groups</b></p>
        <p>The WOTC is intended to encourage employers to hire
        workers from seven groups whose members otherwise may
        have difficulty finding employment. In order to qualify
        for the credit, certain certification and minimum work
        period requirements (discussed below) must be met. The
        seven targeted groups include:</p>
        <p><a name="highrisk"></a></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><b>1. High-risk youths</b></p>
            <p>The high-risk youth group consists of individuals
            who are at least 18 but less than 25 years of age as
            of the date hired and who reside in either a Federal
            &quot;empowerment zone&quot; or a Federal
            &quot;enterprise community.&quot;</p>
            <p>The nine current Federal empowerment zones are
            designated areas within Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago,
            Detroit, New York City, Philadelphia and Camden, the
            Kentucky Highlands (Clinton, Jackson, and Wayne
            Counties, KY), the Mississippi Mid-Delta region, and
            the Rio Grande Valley (Starr, Cameron, Hidalgo, and
            Willacy Counties, TX). There currently are 95
            designated Federal enterprise communities.</p>
            <p><a name="smmryouths"></a></p>
            <p><b>2. Qualified summer youths</b></p>
            <p>The qualified summer youth category also is
            limited to young workers living in empowerment zones
            and enterprise communities. An employer may claim the
            WOTC with respect to 16-and 17-year-old youths who
            (1) reside in empowerment zones or enterprise
            communities and (2) work for the employer between May
            1 and September 15. (The age limitation is measured
            as of the date of hire or May 1, whichever is later.)
            The youth may not have worked for the employer during
            the 90-day period prior to the date of hire. The
            minimum work period requirement and the maximum
            credit-eligible wage amount are reduced for qualified
            summer youths due to the limited employment period. </p>
            <p><a name="iv-a"></a></p>
            <p><b>3. Qualified IV-A recipients</b></p>
            <p>This category consists of members of families who
            have received assistance under part A of title IV of
            the Social Security Act, Aid to Families with
            Dependent Children (AFDC), for at least a nine-month
            period ending during the nine-months preceding the
            date of hire.</p>
            <p><a name="foodstamps"></a></p>
            <p><b>4. Qualified food stamp recipients</b></p>
            <p>This group consists of individuals who are at
            least 18 but less than 25 years old (on the date of
            hire) and:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>whose family has received food stamp
                    assistance for the six months preceding the
                    date of hire, or</p>
                    <p>in the case of an individual whose family
                    no longer qualifies for food stamps because
                    of section 6(o) of the Food Stamp Act of
                    1977, whose family has received food stamps
                    for at least three of the last five months
                    preceding the date of hire.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <p><a name="vetrans"></a></p>
            <p><b>5. Qualified veterans</b></p>
            <p>Qualified veterans are veterans who are a member
            of a family that has received:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>AFDC assistance for at least a nine-month
                    period ending during the 12 months preceding
                    the date of hire, or</p>
                    <p>food stamp assistance for at least a
                    three- month period ending during the 12
                    months preceding the date of hire.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <p>For WOTC purposes, veterans are defined as
            individuals who (1) either served on active duty in
            the Armed Forces, other than in training, for more
            than 180 days or were discharged or released from
            active duty for a service-connected disability and
            (2) did not serve on extended active duty during the
            60- day period preceding the date of hire.</p>
            <p><a name="vo-techrehabs"></a></p>
            <p><b>6. Vocational rehabilitation referrals</b></p>
            <p>An employer may claim the WOTC with respect to an
            individual who has a physical or mental disability
            that constitutes or results in a substantial handicap
            to employment if the individual is referred to the
            employer by a designated local agency while receiving
            or upon the completion of certain vocational
            rehabilitation training.</p>
            <p><a name="ex-felons"></a></p>
            <p><b>7. Qualified ex-felons</b></p>
            <p>Targeted workers within this group are individuals
            who (1) have been convicted of a felony under Federal
            or State law and (2) are hired by the employer
            claiming the WOTC not more than one year after the
            individual's last conviction or prison release date.
            Maximum family income limitations apply.</p>

        <b>Minimum Employment Period;<br>
        Other Ineligible Individuals</b></p>
        <p>Minimum employment period requirements also apply.
        Qualified workers must work for the employer for at least
        either:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>180 days (20 days in the case of a qualified
                summer youth employee), or </p>
                <p>400 hours (120 hours in the case of a
                qualified summer youth employee).</p>
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>If a worker is employed less than the minimum required
        time, then the employer cannot claim any credit as to
        that employee.</p>
        <p>Also, no credit is available for wages paid to
        individuals related directly or indirectly to the
        employer or to certain individuals previously employed by
        the taxpayer.</p>

        <p align="center"><br>
        <b>Certification</b></p>
        <p>An individual may qualify as a member of one or more
        of the targeted groups discussed above only if that
        individual is certified by a State employment security
        agency as meeting the specified requirements for that
        group. The Small Business Job Protection Act provides an
        employer with two certification procedures that may be
        followed. The employer may receive a written
        certification on or before the day on which the
        individual begins work. Alternatively, the employer may
        complete a specified pre-screening notice on or before
        the day the individual is offered employment and then
        submit such notice for certification no later than 21
        days after the individual begins working.</p>
        <p>The pre-screening notice must contain information that
        the employee provides to the employer that forms the
        basis of the employer's belief that the individual is a
        member of a targeted group. The employer and the
        individual must sign the notice under penalties of
        periury.</p>

        <b>Qualified Wage Exclusions</b></p>
        <p>For purposes of the WOTC, lhe term &quot;wages&quot;
        generally has the same meaning as for purposes of the
        Federal Unemployment Tax Act. However, credit-eligible
        wages do not include:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>wages paid to an individual if the employer
            receives federally funded payments for on-thejob
            training of the individual;</p>
            <p>work supplementation payments paid to the employer
            in connection with the worker under section 482(e) of
            the Social Security Act; and certain payments for
            services during labor disputes.</p>
