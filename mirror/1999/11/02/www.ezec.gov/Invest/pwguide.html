    <p><b>Preface</b> </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The Clinton Administration's Empowerment
        Zones/Enterprise Communities (EZ/EC) Initiative
        represents a new way of doing business for the Federal
        government. This new approach recognizes that communities
        know best their own needs. It is based on a pact between
        the Federal government and each EZ/EC site. The pact is
        your assurance that the Federal government will work
        across agency lines, and in new partnerships with state
        and local governments and business, to make your
        successful entry into Empowerment Zones and Enterprise
        Communities as simple as possible.</p>
        <p>The Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities Program
        was established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
        of 1993. Between January and June 1994, 520 communities
        around the country worked to develop comprehensive
        strategic plans with input from all the shareholder
        groups in the community. On December 21, 1994, after a
        national competition to determine which communities would
        be designated for the program, President Clinton
        announced the results.</p>
        <p>The 72 urban EZ/EC areas, which present unprecedented
        business opportunities in distressed cities, were
        selected based on their ability to satisfy four
        fundamental principles:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><b>E</b>conomic Opportunity: Creating jobs,
            attracting private partnerships, and training
            residents for new job opportunities.</p>
            <p><b>S</b>ustainable Community Development:
            Promoting physical and human development -- such as
            safe streets, clean air and water, lifelong learning,
            and a commitment to personal, family and civic
            responsibility -- as part of a long-term strategy of
            economic development.</p>
            <p><b>C</b>ommunity-Based Partnerships: Involving the
            entire community, including residents, community
            groups, private and non-private sectors, education
            and religious institutions, and local and state
            governments.</p>
            <p><b>S</b>trategic Vision for Change: Coordinating a
            response to the needs of a community by integrating
            economic, physical, human and other strategies. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The communities identified through the competition
        exhibited a clear commitment to a coordinated community
        development effort, offering business an enhanced
        community environment in which to operate.</p>
        <p>This Guide explains the four classes of Empowerment
        Zones and Enterprise Communities and the special
        incentives being made available to you, but only when you
        join the public/private partnership to empower people and
        communities to rebuild America's poverty-stricken inner
        cities. Specific information on tax benefits, technical
        assistance, and loan opportunities are just several of
        the areas in which Federal, state, and local governments
        can help.</p>
        <p>This publication summarizes key elements of the
        programs and incentives available to EZ/EC </p>
        <p>designated businesses. For more details, be sure to
        read the regulations and notices promulgated by the
        Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as well as
        relevant Internal Revenue Code provisions and IRS
        publications and forms.</p>

    <p><b>The Community Empowerment Board</b> </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The Community Empowerment Board is chaired by the Vice
        President with Cabinet members and other senior
        government officials. Each Community Empowerment Board
        member is committed to cutting through bureaucratic
        red-tape and providing coordinated, simplified access to
        Federal resources for the four classes of urban
        designations participating in the Initiative.</p>
        <p>The Community Empowerment Board works with major
        foundations, pension funds, utilities, and insurance
        companies to develop collaborative technical assistance.</p>

    America</b> </p>
    <p align="center"><i>Community-Based Development Makes Good
    Business Sense <br>
    Learn What Public/Private Partnerships Can Mean for You</i></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The relationships government is forging with business
        are changing. With the decade of the nineties has come an
        Administration that believes we will only get out of our
        communities what we take the time to invest in them.
        President Clinton saw the importance of providing
        incentives for business investment in inner-city
        communities as the first step toward revitalizing the
        American city -- the result is the Administration's
        Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities Initiative. The
        EZ/EC Initiative is based upon a new covenant between the
        Federal government and each EZ/EC community: Rather than
        fighting bureaucratic red- tape, you will find a
        refreshing new way of doing business with a clear assist
        from the government. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The various incentives that are the cornerstones of
        the EZ/EC revitalization strategy offer valuable
        opportunities that can change how you do business. As
        inner-city communities evolve into neighborhoods of
        choice, there will be enormous opportunities for your
        business to grow in conjunction with the enhanced
        operating environment -- a trained work force, safe
        neighborhoods, and an involved community -- not only to
        sustain your business, but to help it to expand and
        become an integral part of the community.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>As you use this GUIDE to establish appropriate courses
        of action, you will easily be able to identify the
        potential for measurable benefits to your bottom line.
        Resources are already being made available to EZ/EC
        cities. The next step should position you to explore
        business opportunities within the specific Empowerment
        Zones and Enterprise Communities. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The invitation is simple: Help us rebuild America and
        you will soon be convinced that an investment of your
        time and resources is a wise investment. Join us as we
        invent a new, improved way for you to do business. </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The EZ/EC program provides new tax incentives
                over the next ten years to induce commercial
                investment in distressed communities. For the
                first five years, these incentives are estimated
                to amount to $2.5 billion. The incentives include
                Wage Tax Credits, Accelerated Depreciation, and
                Tax-Exempt Facility Bonds. These incentives ease
                the tax burden for businesses that either locate
                or expand within these designated areas and
                Employment Zone residents.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>In general, wage tax credits are available to
                any employer engaged in trade or business in the
                Empowerment Zone. For each resident employee or
                new hire, the business is eligible for up to
                $3,000 each year in tax credits. The amount of
                these credits is determined by multiplying the
                percentages of credit according to year by up to
                $15,000 in qualified wages. </p>
                <p><i>Which Employees Are Eligible?</i></p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The credit is available for Empowerment
                    Zone residents employed full- or part-time

                    substantially all their services within the
                    Zone. However, the credit is also applicable
                    if an employee becomes disabled after working
                    for less than 90 days or if the Zone Business
                    changes its form of business, so long as the
                    employee continues working for the business.</p>

                    on the job less than 90 days; business owner
                    families and any other business owner with

            <blockquote>
                <p>Section 179 is available only to qualified EZ

                Empowerment Zone Business taxpayer, you may write
                off as an expense the cost of the depreciable,
                tangible personal property you purchase up to
                $37,500. (It is generally limited to equipment
                purchases.) This provides you with a deduction
                that is $20,000 more than the normal $17,500
                first-year write-off Section 179 permits to other
                business not within designated Zones.</p>
                <p><i>Are There Special Requirements?</i></p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Yes. The deduction only applies to
                    tangible personal property (usually limited
                    to equipment) purchased after December 21,
                    1994 by a qualified Zone Business. The
                    original use of the property must be in the
                    Zone beginning with the person claiming the
                    write-off, and substantially all of the use
                    of the property must be in the Zone, and used
                    in a Zone Business.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p><i>Are There Any Exceptions?</i></p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Yes. If you acquired the property prior to
                    December 21, 1994, it may still be considered
                    qualified Zone Property if substantial
                    renovations are made during the two years
                    immediately succeeding the date of
                    designation. Used tangible property may be
                    qualified Zone Property if it has not
                    previously been used within an Empowerment
                    Zone.</p>
                    <p>The special first-year allowance may be

            <blockquote>
                <p>As a qualified EZ/EC Business, you may qualify
                for a new category of private activity bonds that
                offers lower rates than conventional financing
                and permits you to finance business property and
                land. It permits you to finance new facilities or
                renovate or expand existing facilities in EZ/ECs
                through tax-exempt bonds. In addition to offering
                you lower interest rates than conventional
                financing, tax-exempt bond status provides access
                to non-traditional lenders, such as insurance
                companies, various funds, and individual
                investors. </p>
                <p>Generally, the bonds may be used in a wide
                range of commercial settings. Commercial rental
                real estate is a permissible use of financing as
                long as 50% of the gross rental income from the
                property is from EZ/EC Businesses. The bonds may
                also be used to finance rental of personal
                property so long as substantially all of the
                rental income is generated from EZ/EC Businesses
                or EZ/EC Residents.</p>
                <p>Unlike Section 179 expensing, businesses with
                only satellite offices or a portion of the
                business within the EZ/EC may qualify, regardless
                of whether the business qualifies as a whole. For
                example, a business in a Zone that is part of a
                national chain could qualify provided that it
                meets the definition of an EZ/EC Business if it
                were incorporated separately.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Are There Special Considerations?</i></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Yes. At least 95% or more of the net proceeds
                of the bond issue must be used to finance
                qualified Zone property whose principal user is a
                qualified EZ/EC Business. It is generally
                required that individuals using the bonds for
                renovation spend as much on fixing up a property
                as they did on acquiring it. The definition of
                business may include all principal users of the
                facility including major tenants.</p>
                <p>Qualified EZ/EC facility bonds are exempt from
                the general tax-exempt bond restrictions on
                financing the acquisition of land and existing
                property. Generally, all other rules related to
                tax-exempt private activity bonds for exempt
                facilities do apply.</p>

            <p><i>Are There Any Limitations?</i></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Yes. A business may be the principal user of
                no more than $3 million of Zone bonds per EZ/EC
                and $20 million for all designated areas. The
                total volume of EZ/EC bonds per state will be
                limited by the amount that can be accommodated
                under the state's volume cap for tax-exempt
                bonds.</p>
                <p>Although bonds may be used to finance various
                types of property (buildings, equipment,
                machinery and other depreciable property), the
                bonds may not be used to finance working capital,
                inventory, and other non-capital items. EZ/EC
                Bonds may not be used to finance residential
                rental real estate, nor may they be used by a
                current owner of an asset to refinance that

                <p>Under this program, the Department of Housing
                and Urban Development (HUD) provides loan
                guarantees and economic revitalization grants.
                Using the authority of the Housing and Community
                Development Act of 1974, the Administration
                created the Economic Development Initiative (EDI)
                two years ago to provide an additional level of
                security by allowing Section 108 monies to be
                used to finance various community development
                activities.</p>
                <p>These monies, used in tandem with Section 108
                loan guarantees, further promote economic
                revitalization. They offer EZ/EC Businesses
                various interest rate subsidies, debt
                service/operating reserves, etc. The Economic
                Revitalization Grants provide additional
                assurance that the Section 108 loans can be
                repaid from project revenue.</p>
                <p>Several of the EZ/EC have remaining EDI funds
                that are available to provide financial
                assistance in conjunction with Section 108.</p>

                <p>Yes. Section 108 monies can be used to finance
                activities that directly benefit EZ/EC
                businesses. They include:</p>

<p>These activities are supported with Section 108 monies in the
following ways:</p>

<p><br>
<b>LOAN GUARANTEES</b> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>HUD guarantees notes issued by units of general local
    government. These funds are used to stimulate or retain
    businesses or jobs, or that otherwise lead to economic
    revitalization. There is a set-aside of $500 million in loan
    guarantees for Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities.</p>

<p><br>
<b>COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS (CDBG)</b> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Available at the local level, CDBG funds can provide
    special benefits to businesses that are located in census
    tracts that meet the Federal Empowerment Zones/Enterprise
    Communities criteria. In general, Community Development Block
    Grant funds may be used to provide direct assistance and
    technical assistance to for-profit businesses, including
    SBA-designated micro-enterprises (see definition, next
    section) and to public and private organizations to
    facilitate economic development by owners of
    micro-enterprises. Assistance is available in the form of
    credit, peer support programs, and counseling. In addition,
    CDBG funds may also be used for business incubators and
    public infrastructures serving business.</p>

    <p>If you qualify as a small business, the One-Stop Capital

    <p>SBA Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) provide
    management assistance to present and prospective small
    business owners. They provide one-stop, individual
    counseling, training, and market research support at a
    central location. SBDCs located throughout the United States
    are housed at designated educational institutions and state
    agencies.</p>
    <p>SBA Business Information Centers (BICs) provide the latest
    information in high-technology, hardware, software, and
    telecommunications to assist small business. BICs use
    state-of-the-art personal computers, graphics workstations,
    CD-ROM technology, and interactive videos that allow the
    small business owner or manager access to market research
    databases, planning and spreadsheet software, and vast
    libraries of information on starting or building a business.</p>
    <p>SBA's Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) is a
    volunteer organization of retired (and some active) business
    executives who assist in developing personalized business
    plans as well as sharing significant expertise in facets of
    small business operations. SCORE volunteers are often housed
    at SBA Business Information Centers as well as at Small
    Business Development Centers.</p>
    <p>Be Aware of Social Service Block Grants to Develop
    Community Services, Support Business Development, and Create
    an Empowerment Continuum. </p>
    <p>Inner-city programs are underway to improve security, job
    training, physical environment, and overall quality of life
    in the EZ/ECs. We want to do everything possible to assure
    that business investment in EZ/ECs is a sound venture.
    Therefore, the various Federal, local, and state agencies are
    providing funding for the community as a whole that goes
    beyond financial and technical assistance to a business
    owner.</p>
    <p>To this end, one billion dollars in flexible Social
    Service Block Grant (SSBG) funds are being used to promote
    economic self-sufficiency and reduce government dependency
    for EZ/EC residents. Each urban EZ will receive $100 million
    in SSBG funds for approved activities. Each EC will receive
    approximately $3 million in SSBG funds. </p>

<p><i>What Can This Mean to You? </i></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A lot. The social service package that is included in the
    EZ/EC strategy means you are opening a business in an area
    with unlimited potential. It means that the Empowerment Zones
    and Enterprise Communities have available to them both
    financial and technical assistance programs to provide for
    its residents:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <dl>
            <dt>Business and Job Training Skills;</dt>
            <dt>Job Readiness Training;</dt>
            <dt>Transportation Services;</dt>
            <dt>Child Care Services;</dt>
            <dt>Financial Management Counseling; and</dt>
            <dt>Educational and School-Based Programs.</dt>
        </dl>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Programs within these categories provide a continuum of
    similar funding vehicles as those available to business, and
    are offered through various Federal agency programs at the
    Departments of Commerce, Education, Health and Human
    Services, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, and
    Transportation; the General Services Administration; and
    Office of National Drug Control Policy.</p>

<p><b>Afterword</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Clinton Administration has developed and supported
    initiatives that are resulting in a variety of programs
    designed to stimulate business development in cities that are
    targeted to provide the business opportunities of the next
    decades.</p>
    <p>Although the thrust of the programs is based on the
    realization that, as a nation, we cannot be strong if our
    inner cities are in decay, there is a bonus for businesses
    with vision. President Clinton believes that: We cannot . . .
    repair the American family community and restore the American
    family until we provide the structure, the value, the
    discipline and the reward that work gives. Because nothing
    worthwhile is without some effort, we urge you to share with
    local EZ/EC authorities the barriers or concerns that you may
    have identified as hindrances to doing business. They stand
    ready and able to assist you.</p>
    <p>You are poised on the threshold of an opportunity that,
    beyond its social good, makes good business sense. Become a
    partner as we implement this vision of America and you can
    take advantage of the incentives to grow bigger and better.
    Best of all, you will have the added benefit of knowing that
    you had been part of an unprecedented effort to meet the
    greatest challenge to our economic strength. Join us as we
    rebuild America.</p>
