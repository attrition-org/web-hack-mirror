</H3><HR WIDTH="95%" ALIGN=CENTER>


<I><P><B>Office of the Assistant Attorney General</B></P>
</I><P>The Office of the Assistant Attorney General (OAAG) has policy coordination and general authority over Office of Justice Programs (OJP). The activities of the office focus on attaining the goal of reducing crime and improving the criminal justice systems. Four program offices, which address corrections, drug courts, empowerment of local communities, and domestic violence, are located within the OAAG . Additionally, the Indian Office was established within the OAAG to ensure that Indian tribes and tribal organizations have access to information and funding.</P>

<P>Three of the program offices located within the OAAG were formed to help implement the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act; they are the Corrections Program Office, the Drug Courts Office, and the Violence Against Women Office.  In addition, the Executive Office for Weed and Seed is located within the OAAG.  Each of these offices continues to provide service to Indian Country through grant programs, technical assistance, and support of new initiatives.  </P>

<P>The OJP American Indian &amp; Alaska Native Affairs Office (Indian Office) was established in June 1995 to facilitate effective grant funding services to Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages through coordination of grant programs, training, and technical assistance. The Indian Office provides assistance in coordinating current tribal funding among various OJP components to enhance technical assistance, monitoring, and program support; assists in the planning and development of new program initiatives throughout DOJ bureaus and executive program offices in ways that address the needs of tribal governments; and works with DOJ’s Office of Tribal Justice and other federal agencies to improve and increase services to tribes, tribal governments and organizations. </P>

<I><P><B>Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Grants for Indian Tribes.</B></I> The OJP Corrections Program Office’s discretionary grant program provides Indian tribes an opportunity to build or renovate jails on tribal lands for the incarceration of offenders subject to tribal jurisdiction. Consistent with her focus on addressing the needs of juvenile offenders in the criminal justice system, the Attorney General has directed that grant monies under this program meet all federal requirements and serve the goal of improving safety, security, and services for incarcerated youths. In FY 1999, $34 million will be available to tribal governments for constructing jails on tribal lands for the incarceration of offenders subject to tribal jurisdiction. Applications will be available to both Barrow, Alaska and Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. The remainder of the grant funds will be used to fund projects submitted from those tribes on the BIA priority list and the CIRCLE Project.</P>
<I>
<P><B>The STOP Violence Against Indian Women Discretionary Grant Program.</B></I>  The Violence Against Women Act specifies that 4 percent of the amount appropriated each year for the STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program be available for grants to tribal governments. The OJP Violence Against Women Office’s discretionary grant program is designed to encourage Indian governments to develop and implement innovative and effective approaches to address violence against Indian women. In FY 1999, $206.75 million for the STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program, of which $8.2 million is allocated to the STOP Violence Against Women Discretionary Grants Program. A portion of the funds provided under this Program has been set aside to provide technical assistance to tribal grantees. Applications were due February 26, 1999. </P>

<I><P><B>Native American Pass-Through Program.</B></I>  Reauthorized in 1992, the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (the Act) specifies that a proportion of each state’s Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention<B> </B>formula<B> </B>grant program funding be made available to fund programs for Indian tribes.  The tribal allocation, known as the Native American pass-through program, provides funds to Indian tribes to perform law enforcement functions pertaining to the custody of children.  Areas receiving funding include police efforts to prevent, control, or reduce crime and delinquency; apprehension of criminal and delinquency offenders; and activities of adult and juvenile corrections, probation, or parole authorities. Additionally, Indian tribal grantees must comply with three mandated requirements of the Act: grantees may not detain status offenders in secure detention or correctional facilities, detain or confine juveniles in any institution where they have contact with adult prisoners, or detain or confine juveniles in adult jails or lockups. The minimum &quot;pass-through&quot; requirements of states to Indian tribes were $275,349 in FY 1995, $277,451 in FY 1996, and $330,284 in FY 1997.  These amounts were allocated to Indian tribes in 36 states. Historically, in many states the actual amounts awarded to Indian tribes by the states far exceed the statutorily required amount.

<I><P><B>Victim Assistance in Indian Country Program</B></I>.  The Victim Assistance in Indian Country Program (VAIC) creates permenant, accessible, and responsive victim assistance services in Indian country. It provides funding directly to Indian tribes governed by federal criminal jurisdiction to support the establishment of reservation-based victim assistance programs. Services provided include crisis intervention, emergency shelter, mental health counseling, and court advocacy.  In FY 1999, OVC will make awards to 20 federally recognized Indian tribes totaling $1 million. Awards will range from $40,000 - $60,000.</P>

<I><P><B>Children's Justice Act Discretionary Grant Program for Native Americans (CJA).</B></I>  The CJA program supports Indian communities in developing, establishing, and operating programs to improve the investigation, prosecution, and handling of child abuse cases, particularly cases of child sexual abuse, in a manner that increases support and reduces additional trauma to child victims.  The partnership projects address shortcomings in the tribal criminal justice system and make systematic improvements in the overall response to serious child abuse and child sexual abuse cases on the reservation. In FY 1999, OVC will continue support for eight existing CJA programs and will fund nine new CJA programs in FY 1999. Applications are due May 14, 1999.</P>

<I><P><B>Tribal Court Assistance Program.</B></I> The Bureau of Justice Assistance will administer $5 million in discretionary funds for the Tribal Court Assistance Program. Funds will assist tribal governments in the development, enhancement, and continuing operations of tribal justice systems. These grants will be competitive, based upon the extent and urgency of the need of each applicant, and will be supported with an extensive array of technical assistance. Once a formal plan is submitted to Congress, further information will be made available by BJA.
