Welcome to the FBody.com Search engine. This search engine uses a
custom designed database with information provided by a spider. Soon,
another spider will join the search engine to provide more information 
to users. Currently, the spider indexes your TITLE, Keywords, and Description,
from your site. To control how your site gets indexed, use the META tags and title tags
wisely.
<BR><BR>
This search engine is by no means the best, BUT, for the work I put into it, its goal, purpose, and use, it works pretty well. Searching is pretty quick, spidering is quick (if your host server is also quick),
and the system processing that takes place behind the scenes (databse stuff) goes pretty quickly. I have indexed several sites that I can think of, feel free to add your own site to the list. comments, suggestions, etc. let me know. I will not distribute 











this code to anyone, so don't ask:) the basic code is PERL, with some behind the scens stuff being done in C. I will not index your site higher for any searches (unless you offer me another car or money or something:)
<BR><BR>
To add your site to the index, <A HREF='linkadd.htm'>Click Here</A>.
<BR><BR>
If you want the spider to update the index with a new version of your site,
all you have to do is resubmit the URL as if you were adding a new one. To 
help eliminate spam, the number of submissions from each site is limited. 
Anyone found spamming the indexed will have their entire domain banned.
<BR><BR>
<B>Tips:</B><BR>
<LI> This search engine knows all about quotes so use them often! For example, a search for:<BR>
<DD><B>"Automatic Transmission"</B><BR>
is likely to yield better, more accurate results than a search for:<BR>
<BR><B>Automaitc Transmission</B><BR>
<BR>
<LI> Percentages are given to show you what the engine thinks of the links it found. I've found the search engine doesn't think much of many sites, so even if 30% is the highest percentage, it doesn't mean the link isn't what you were looking for. However








, some searches will get results in the 90-70 range, of which some links will be accurate, others will not, nothing is perfect, and the best this engine can do is guess at comparing what it knows vs. what you want to know.
<BR><BR>
<LI> This engine _KNOWS_ what urls it has stored and what pages are hsoted on what servers. To try these features out, use these searches:<BR>
<DD><B>url:http://www.yoursitehere.com</B><BR>
will only find a match if that exact URL is in the DB<BR>
<DD><B>host:http://www.yoursitehere.com</B><BR>
Will list any pages hosted on the domain you type.
<BR><BR>
<B>Good luck and Enjoy!</B>
