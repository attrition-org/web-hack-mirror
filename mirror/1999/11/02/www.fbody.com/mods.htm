<center><b>General Exhaust</b></center>
<p>
This is perhaps the first thing that most anyone does to thier cars, some people go all-out with headers, some just get mufflers, some gut the cat.  Here is are some key points:
<p>
So-called "Turbo" or glasspacked muffler, even though louder, often flow <b>less</b> than OEM (original equipment manufacturer) mufflers
<p>
"Gutting" the cat (catalytic converter) is illegal, and even though it can add horsepower, it can get you into trouble with state inspectors as well as hippies. : )  It's up to you. A great way to be both street legal and get good flow at the track or hig




hway is a cable-pull cutout. There are also high-flow cats.
<p>
Large pipes are good for flow, but it can be <b>too</b> large. In short, you need some backpressure for proper cylinder ignition.  Low is the key word, not no backpressure.  If you have a stock engine, 3 1/2 inch pipes are doing more harm than good.
<p>
When putting on your new exhaust, it's important that you like the tone. You will be hearing that sound every day, so you may have to try a few mufflers before you get that sound you like.  Also, tips with resonators can add tone and reduce noise.
<p>
OK, here we go.

<center><b>Headers</b></center>
<p>
<center><img src="header2.jpg"></center>
<p>
Headers are one of the best mods for the money.  They cost from $80.00 to well over $600.00, depending on many factors, including material, stainless or steel, coating, y-pipe, AIR fittings, size, and company.  Headers are a replacement for the OEM exhaus




t manifolds, which are restrictive and very low flow.  Manifolds are small ports for exhaust. Headers add an individual pipe, or primary, to each of the 4 exhaust ports on each side.  This greatly improves flow and therefor improves horsepower, torque, th




rottle response, and even gas milage.  And they sound awsome at WOT (wide open throttle).
<p>
H.P. = as much as 20 rear-wheel horsepower can be gained.
<p>
Cost = $80.00 to $1300, depending on options.
<p>
Options = Ceramic Coating, AIR fitting, O2 fitting, equal length, included y-pipe, diameter, pipe gauge, stainless <center>steel, collectors, fully welded, all of these effect cost and performance.</center>

<center><b>Mufflers</b></center>
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="muffler2.gif"></center>
<p>
Mufflers are a good place to start when speeding up your car.  With all the types available, 2/3 chamber, 2-out, glasspacks, race, disc, and many others, it's easy to choose the wrong one.  Plain and simple, high flow and good sound are are a must.  Most 




companies will tell you CFM ratings, but the sound is a trial-and-error kind of thing.  In a John Lingenfelter (Mr. Smallblock) lab test, <a href="http://www.borla.com">Borla</a> is the highest flow, yet it is close to the most pricey.  Just stay away fro




m glasspacks and open pipes, these are the two worst options, due to too much and not enough backpressure.
<p>
H.P. = Dyno's by HotRod Magazine show 11 for a Borla muffler.

<p>
When most people talk about catalytic converters and adding performance, they plan to gut or remove them. First this is illegal, and second it can create harmful turbulence in your exhaust, which can disrupt pulse and cancel out scavenging, therefor incre




asing backpressure. You can do what you want, and there are many different points of veiw on the subject. I would go for the high flow cat. It is stainless, slick looking and flows very well. And you will pass emissions every time. These are available fro

<A HREF="http://www.motorville.com/kn_home/kn.html">K&N </A> Filterchargers are high flow cotton (instead of OEM paper) elements that flow a lot more air. This means horsepower, but not much.  But it's the sum of the parts.  Every little bit always helps.




 So don't run out and get those wheelie bars just yet. Plus they are reusable and washable and last forever. There are Filters that can flow more, but do not trap dirt as well.  These are race only foam filters by LG Motorsports.

<center><b>Underdrive Pulleys</b></center>
<p>
<center><img src="pull2.jpg"></center>
<p>
Your rear wheels aren't the only thing using your engine's power.  That's why car's HP ratings are at the flywheel, before your accessories, water pump, air conditioning, power steering, alternator, etc., rob you of HP. This is called "parasitic power los




s", and the universal, although not always accurate number is 18-20hp. This means 320 at the flywheel, or engine, (car companies quote at the flywheel) is 300 or less to the ground. To help reduce this loss, you can use underdrive pulleys, although don't 




expect to get all 20-30hp back. They slow down your accessories, some of them, and require less power to drive them and therefor get more power to the wheels.  They also make your accessories last longer. To further reduce accessory drag, you could instal




l an electric water pump or AIR pump. It is important to note that slowing down your accessories also slows your alternator, which leads to dim lights and dead batteries. It's best to get a 2-peice set. 3-peice sets are for show and do not help charge or 




gain HP. But, getting only a crank underdrive pulley, although annoying for the power loss, <b>is</b> your best bet for power. A shorter belt is required, and often not included. The most popular pulleys are made by <a href="http://www.marchperf.com">Marc

rammed set of instructions that the factory puts in, or uploads, to your car. These are not always performance oriented, and therefor changing this chip <b>would</b> be a good idea.  But ready made chips are not the way to go.  First of all, they are not 




set up for your car and mod combination.  To get a good chip, you must get it custom made, or burned according to what you want. A few companies will do this, at a price of coarse.  4th Generation cars can get "Power Programmers", made by <a href="http://




www.hypertech-inc.com/Hypertech"> Hypertech</a> and do it themselves.  In short, get a custom burned or nothing.  And one more thing, with any chip, you must use 93 octane gas.
<p>
H.P. = For a custom, or P.P., as much as 15 to the rear wheels.

<p>
This is a very cheap mod that you can do in 10 minutes.  Stock thermostats are set at 195 degrees.  Simply buying the thermostat for your car rated at 180 or even 160 can reduce engine temp..  Usually, 160 is best used and even requires with an aftermarke




t chip. To further cool your engine, you can get a cool fan switch, made by <a href="http://www.jetchip.com">JET</a>, which will turn your electric fan(s) on at a lower temp. than the stock setting, or make your own by rigging a switch to the fan wire. Cl

<center><b>Easy Formula Cowl Mod.</b></center>
<p>
This can barely be called a mod because it is more like a trick.  If you have a Formula, which you most likely do, you probably have the hood with the closed tear-drop cowl.  I know you've thought about taking that little plate out.  Do it!  Water won't h




urt anything in the engine, and the heat just pours out of that thing keeping your engine cooler.  And if you put in some screening from a home improvement warehouse, it looks custom and very nice.  I suggest painting it black with a glossy clearcoat.  Al




l you do is unscrew the plate with the four small screws.  Hold the black plate agains a sheet of screening (metal, of course) and cut out a peice to fit.  That's it.  I'm working on a plan to get air from the cowl via a little duct and an aluminum air pa




n.  I hope it works, I'll keep you posted.

<p>
<center><img src="ign2.jpg"></center>
<p>
<center><font size=-2>I think this one is <b>ugly</b>!</font></center>
<p>
Many components make up a good ignition system.  A control box, or ignition box, a coil, good wires, and good spark plugs. 
   First things first, despite what you've heard, studies show that those fancy "SplitFire" that are like $9 a piece, actually burn too hot for most cars and do a lot of damage. Cheap Bosch or Accel plugs are fine. Now that that's out of the way...
   Ignition may add throttle response, but not much if any horses. You can feel a difference in throttle feel, but don't expect it to transform your car just because it is an expensive mod. But if your serious, it's a pretty good idea. It's like a lot of 




other mods such as suspension and cooling.  They don't add power, but they help the machine run in top condition.  The boxes, made by Mallory, <a href="http://www.MSD ignition.com>MSD</a>, or <a href="http://www.mrgasket.com/accel.html>Accel</a>, are just




 delivering a better, more sure-fire spark.  There are tons to choose from, and some speed shops have in-store demo's to show just how much better thier spark is. It is a must for superchargers. Wires should be heat resistant and 7.5mm-8.8mm in size. (Sto




ck is 7mm) Coils amplify the spark, and are a direct replacement, and easy to install.
<p>
H.P. = A couple maybe, the real gain is throttle response.
<p>
Cost = $100 to $500, coil may or may not be extra.
<p>
Options = Rev limiter, retard adjust, volt control

<p>
This is a modification that would be more leaning towards the race side of your car because it kills gas milage and makes your car nearly redline on the highway.  It does however help acceleration and 1/4 mile times by leaps and bounds, and it is a very p




opular mod today.  One advantage is PosiTraction.  Your car, more than likely, spins one tire.  Posi units spin whichever tire is on the ground, for better starts and more traction. For a serious racer, this would be a second or third mod that is a must.

<center><b>52-58mm Throttle Bodies</b></center>
<p>
<center><img src="throt22.jpg"></center>
<p>
In a EFI engine, there is an easy, although expensive, way to get a lot more air into the engine, and air means horsepower.  This is done in a lot of ways, such as runners, intake manifolds, cold air induction,  (I'll get into those later), and another is




 a larger trottle body.  This, in a nutshell, is where the air is drawn into the engine according to the throttle. By increasing it's size, you draw in more air easily. The 52mm flows 780 cfm, which is great for stock to mildly modified engines. The 58 is




 for modified (intake manifold, ported heads, cam, headers, etc.) because they flow a massive 1050 cfm. More flow can also be gained by boring, or widening, the existing T.B., but it's just easier and more effective to get a new one.  Some come with air f




oils already attached.

<p>
To add air flow, intake volume, increase fuel economy, and throttle response, us TBI guys can a Throttle Body Spacer and also a injector spacer. You can do just one, but both together is best.  These both work by adding more volume to your TB by putting a




 1/2 inch plate between your intake manifold and the TB itself.  The injector spacers lift the injectors inside the TB to increase airflow.  These together work even better than the air foil in a TPI intake.  You get, as I said, throttle response, more po




wer, and a lot better fuel economy. Up to 11%, to be exact. Plus it is a cheap and pretty easy mod. I only know of 2 places that sell them, they are listed below.

o your stock snorkel location.  The hood comes ready to sand and paint.  It will work with stock lifters, and will need insulation. I have heard there are minor problem with ripples, but nothing that will show after painting.  They look great and will mak

Just so you know, the complete name is adjustable fuel pressure regulator. And the name says it all. By adjusting the fuel pressure, you can greatly increase your horsepower. But there is such a slim margin of error that just being off by a fraction of a

eel the power" mod. Like I said, you have to play with it.

H.P. = Adjustable, gains from 5hp - 20hp.

Cost = $60 - $200

<center><b>Ported/Aftermarket Heads</b></center>

The more air and fuel you can get into your engine at one time, the more horsepower you can produce. Building on this principle, by boring out you cylinder heads to a larger size, or "porting the heads", you can greatly improve horsepower. And I don't mea




n K&N horses, I mean true horsepower. Often porting the stock heads yields the most power, and can be done in a well equipped shop, or by your local machine or speed shop. Also, you can buy aftermarket heads, but the are very expensive. Porting will be co




stly as well, but not as much so as buying quality cylinder heads. I suggest you let a pro port them for you, simply because it is a very costly part to make an error on. This is a true horsepower modification that racers have known about for years, and i




t really will give you a very competitive edge.
<p>
H.P. = 30+ rear-wheel HP            
<p>
Cost = $800 - $2000 (New Heads)

<p><br>
These are not performance mods, but will greatly improve your driving experience, ecpecially daily driving. I have done all of these, and I always loved the results.

<b>Bosch Oxygen Sensor</b> - Do to the delicate equipment, special tools, and all around difficulty of this, I would pay someone else to do it. The O2 sensor needs to be replaced every 20,000 miles, and since your car probably has 80+ thousand miles and y




ou've never done it, now is a good time. You can buy it at an parts store, and it will greatly improve your gas milage, I myself gained 3-4 mpg! <br><p>

<b>Halogen 3X headlights</b> - These are pretty inexpensive, and you get the whole assembly, not just the bulb. You will not believe how much better you can see at night. As in the name, they are 3 times brighter, but shine down, so you won't blind traffi




c. Plus they are whiter than those yellow things you have in your car now. These are great, and I swear by them. You won't regret this purchase at all.<br><p>

<b>"Gut" the THERMAC</b> - I did this one on my own, but I'm sure people have been doing it for years. *note* The THERMAC is <i>not</i> emissions related, so it is not illegal to modify it. <br>
The THERMAC is just like a carb pre-heat. It lets in only exhaust manifold heat, not fresh air for the first few miles of driving. And if cold-air adds 15 hp, imagine how much you lose feeding in pure hot air. The pre-heat is meant to help carbs start in 




cold weather. Yet 9 out od 10 Formulas are fuel injected, but the pre-heat remains. How do you get rid of it?<br><p>
Easy way: Disconnect the vacuum line leading to the small disc on your intake snorkel.<br>
<p>
Better Way: <p>
1. Take pliers and remove the nail-like pin going in the side of the unit.<br>
2. Take the snorkel elbow off the metal part that comes off the air cleaner assembly.<br>
3. Reach inside and take out the curved metal plate.<br>
4. Take the hose off the exhaust manifold and somehow seal it up, or leave it open and bent up.<br>
5. Reconnect the snorkel and you should be good to go. You can play with it a little, you may need to fabricate a few little things to make it better.
<p>
<b>Homemade Ram Air</b> - I have invented a makeshift ram air, you can read the article about it <a href="http://www.thirdgen.org/tech/tbiramair.html">here.</a>
