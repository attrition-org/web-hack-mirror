  you are all probably wondering why I haven't defaced anything for quite a while? 
  I will tell you, after a certain ammount of time I gave up, because it seemed 
  nobody was hacking for a reason anymore, nobody had a good message. All the 
  hackers who fought for a reason (team spl0it, xoloth1, etc) have quit the scene 
  or no longer deface websites. Recently all people have been doing is defacing 
  .mil's and .gov's for no reason. The recent hacks I have been impressed very 
  much by is the ones done by ytcracker about Russia, Narcissus about various 
  things, and always sarin proving there is a serious lack of government security. 
  I have also noticed there is alot of new groups on the scene, for instance : 
  DHC, Narcissus, JLM, hv2k(werd) and a few others. The DHC hasn't shown much 
  purpose for their hacks, not to say DHC is not a good group, implying that maybe 
  they should hack to get a word out. I have returned for that sole reason only. 
  You can hate me, disagree with me or totally ignore me, maybe you could even 
  agree with me, but it does not matter whether you follow me or not. I stand 
  for what I believe in strongly. I feel as if I am just babbling for no apparent 
  reason now so I will stop because I am sure I'm annoying some. All I have to 
  say is, the people who are hacking against injustices, etc. Keep it up!</font></p>
