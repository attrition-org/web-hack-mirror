		Fuby takes another down! Why? Simple. If you see on Attrition some (hacking) groups take
		several goverment site's down. Because they are using a <u>rewritten</u> PERL script (msadc.pl). It
		scans for several bugs in MSADC.DLL. It is very simple in use. It made a line with your
		text or what you want to process (coding). You can not stop it now! But this month Micro$oft
		will release a patch against it. SP6 it would be! Otherwise remove the stupid MSADC.DLL file
		and nothing can happen. Easy!<BR>
		<BR>
		My hacking activity is now expanded. Also made a alianz with a security company (maybe a contract).
		To inform them about changes on security. I hope to stop the lame defacings and work very soon
		for a security company. Now I am working at a security company with a test NT network. It rulez!<BR>
		<BR>
		Some advice for administrators over the world. When you use something related to Micro$oft take
		attention on the contract. Somewhere stays: "Any misuse is not responsible to us!" Yeah what a
		security! BLAME!<BR>
		<BR>
		Hire or buy security from real hackers and not wannabe by using scripts! Hiring people making own
		scripts and made a own secure OS and WebServer. Example OpenBSD or Linux SuSe users (not RedHat).<BR>
		<BR>
		People at NetHN (hacked on 10th november) take it serious and hired a security company to secure their
		servers.<BR>
		<BR>
		I am not the one that is talking or writing must about security, but I like to warn people they are
		working with it!<BR>
