SO YOU WANT TO START <br>A COVEN OR CIRCLE???!!!</center></b></h1>
<BR><BR>
<h3>
 First things first - take a  good  long  look  at  your desires,  motivation  and  skills.  What role do you see yourself
 playing  in  this  new  group?   'Ordinary'  member?    High Priestess?  High Priest?  And  why do you want
 the job?
<br><br> 
The  title  of  High  Priest and  Priestess are seductive, conjuring up exotic images of yourself in  embroidered  robes,  a  silver crescent (or horned helm) on your brow, adoring celebrants hanging on every word which drops from your lips...
<br><br>
OK - Time for a reality  check.  The  robes  will be stained with wine and candle  wax  soon  enough,   and  not  every  word  you  speak  is  worth  remembering.  A  coven (or circle) leader's  job is mostly hard work between rituals and behind the scenes.  It is not a good  place  to act  out  your  fantasies,  because  the  lives and well-being of  others are involved,  and what is enjoyable to  you  may not be in their best interest.  So consider what you are about to attempt carefully. Have you been in a coven or circle situation before??  What role did you play in those? 
<br><br>
In my personal opinion, you cannot call yourself 'High Priest/Priestess' unless you have studied with a coven or circle for a minimum of 1 year. The reason for this is simple: you need to travel the Wheel of the Year at least once and observe all rituals to fully understand your path.  If you have no 'hands-on' practical experience, then I would suggest you find a coven or circle or study group. I would also suggest that you obtain your Third Degree before you attempt starting a coven or circle.  If you aren't willing to devote your time, energy and resources, then perhaps it's best that you don't try to set up a coven or circle.
<br><br>
 If  your  prime  motive of establishing a coven is to gain status  and ego gratification,  other people will quickly sense that.  If you think it is glamorous - think again.  If you think it will shock your family - don't do it.  If you think it will make you 'cool' - don't do it.  If you have no clue what you are doing - don't! 
<br><br>
Some better reasons for setting up a coven or circle are:  you feel that you will  be performing a useful job for yourself and others;   you  have enjoyed  leadership  roles  in  the  past,  and  proven  yourself capable; or you look forward to learning and growing.  Even  with the best motives in the world,  you will still need to  have -- or quickly develop -- a whole range of skills in order to  handle a leadership role.  
<br><br>
These skills include:  guiding  discussion  in such a way that  everyone  has  an  opportunity  to  express   ideas   and
opinions;  summarizing and clarifying;  conflict resolution,  or helping  participants understand points of disagreement and find potential solutions which  respect everyone's interests; moving the discussion toward consensus,  or decision,   by  identifying  diversions  and  refocussing  attention on goals and priorities; and achieving closure smoothly when  the  essential  work  is completed, or an appropriate stopping place is reached.
<br><br>
Other  competencies  necessary  to the functioning of a coven  or circle are:  ritual leadership,  administration,  teaching,  and counseling. In a coven  the leaders are expected to be fairly capable in all these areas,  even if responsibilities are frequently shared or delegated. 
<br><br>
 Ritual  leadership involves much more than reading invocations by  candlelight.  Leaders must understand the powers they  intend  to  manipulate:  how  they are raised,  channeled and grounded. You must be adept at designing rituals which involve all the  senses.  You should have a collection of songs and chants, dances  and gestures, incense and oils, invocations and spells,  visual  effects  and symbols,  meditations and postures;  and the skill to combine these in a powerful, focused pattern.  You must  have  clarity  of  purpose  and  firm  ethics.   And  you  must  understand  timing:   where a given ritual fits in the cycles  of the Moon and the Wheel of the Year. How to pace the ritual once started, so that energy peaks and  is channeled at the perfect moment.  You must understand the Laws of Magick,  and the  correspondences,  and  when  ritual  is appropriate and when it is not.
<br><br>
 Administration is basic  management  practices  necessary to any organization.  These include  apportioning  work
 fairly, and following up on its progress;  locating resources and  obtaining  them   (information,   money,   supplies);   
communications  (by  telephone,  printed  schedules,  newsletters, email, etc.);   and  keeping  records or accounts of gatherings.
<br><br>
Teaching is crucial to  covens, circles and study groups.  If only one  person has any formal training  or  experience  in  magick,  s/he needs to  transmit  that  knowledge  in  a  way  which respects the  intuitions,  re-emerging past life skills,  and creativity of the  others.  If several participants have some knowledge in differing  areas,  they  can  all share the teaching role.  If no one in the  group has training and you are uncertain where to begin, then you may need to call  on  outside  resources:  informed  and  ethical  priest/priestesses who can act as visiting faculity, or who are willing  to  offer  guidance  by  telephone or correspondence.  Much can be  learned from books,  of course -- assuming you know  which  books  are  trustworthy  and at the appropriate level -- but there is no  substitute for personal instruction for some things.  Magick  can  be  harmful if misused,  and an experienced practitioner can help you avoid pitfalls as well as offering hints and  techniques  not  found in the literature.
<br><br>
 Counseling  is  a  special  role  of  the High Priest or High Priestess.  It is assumed that all members  of  a  coven  share  concern  for  each other's physical,  mental,  emotional and spiritual welfare,  and  are willing to help each other out in  practical  ways.  However,  coven  leaders  are  expected  to  have a special ability to help coverners explore the roots of their personal problems and  choose strategies and tactics to overcome them.  You must have good
listening  skills,  clear  thinking  and  some insight into human nature  are  helpful.  Often,  magickal  skills  such  as  guided visualization,  Tarot counseling and pendulum work are valuable tools as well.
<br><br>
Think  carefully  about  your skills in these areas. Ask  friends or co-workers who can be trusted to give you a candid opinion, how  they see you in some of these roles. Remember - don't ask the questions if you don't want to know the answer.  Meditate,  and decide  what  you  really  want for yourself in organizing the new group.  Will  you be content with being a catalyst and contact person -- simply bringing people with a common interest together, then letting the  group guide its destiny from that point on?  Would you rather  be a facilitator, either for the first months or permanently: a low-key  discussion leader who enables the group to move forward with  a minimum of  misunderstanding  and  wasted  energy?  Or  do  you  really want to be High Priestess or High Priest -- and what exactly does that mean to you? Do you fully understand what a High Priest or High Priestess is responsible for? Have you had any formal training? Are you willing to  serve  as  the  guiding  spirit and acknowledged leader of a  coven?  And if you do want that job,  exactly how much  authority  and  work do you envision as part of it?  
<br><br>
Usually any new people who desire membership within the Coven or Circle must have a 'sponsor'.  This sponsor should be a member in good standing with the Coven or Circle. 
<br><br>
Responsibility of Sponsor: 
<br>  1.Maintain communication with your student
<br>  2. Make sure your student is receiving all information relating to the Coven ..ie - rituals, classes, etc.<br>
3. Make your student aware of the Coven Website (if you have one) <br> 4. Make your student aware of Coven or Circle rules<br> 5. Make sure your student is learning.
<br><br>
Degrees:<br><br>
A First Degree initiate has demonstrated possession of the knowledge and skills needed to take care of his or her own spiritual needs.Also he or she must possess the basic working and hands-on knowledge of: the Elements and with basic correspondences; ability to banish, bless, and consecrate material to prepare it for ritual use; familiarity with basic magical tools; familiarity with the Wheel of the Year; ability to cast and close a Circle; ability to center, ground, and shield; become proficient in one method of divination. The usual time frame for First Degree can be anywhere from 1 - 2 years. 
<br><br>
A Second Degree initiate has demonstrated that he or she: can safely lead a magical working; possesses the willingness and the capacity to minister to the needs of others (this includes mediating and counseling); to work within the Witch/Wiccan/Pagan community. This time frame can be another 1 -3 years. 
<br><br>
A Third Degree initiate has demonstrated that he or she is competent to lead his or her own Coven or Circle. This means 'running the whole show'!! Preparing rituals, assigning duties, counseling, clergy duties. This time frame can be another 1- 3 years.
To attain a Third Degree is no easy task. You must be dedicated and hard-working. 
<br><br>
The above is meant as a general guide to help you with your decision making. It is my opinion that in order to create a workable coven or circle, those who are organizing it  must have a MINIMUM of 1 year experience helping the mother coven or circle with the aspects involved.
