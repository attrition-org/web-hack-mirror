If you choose to follow a path (pagan, witch, wiccan, christian, whatever) then you CANNOT just 'tune in' like a TV set once in a while.   For me, my path IS my religion.  Just to practice it once in a while does not give you the benefit of actually 'knowing' your religion. You must practice it DAILY. It must become second nature to you. To give thanks to the God and Goddess for another day to learn, to perform the Rite of Union, to meditate, to celebrate the festivals according to our Ways, to give proper respect to each other....this is the way I celebrate my life.   I personally think those 'who think this is nice' need to take a second and very hard look at what they are trying to accomplish.
<br><br>
We should participate in our ritual/festivals if we truely believe in them. Now, I am not saying to 'follow blindly', but read the materials, the rituals....see for yourself if they call to you...they did to me...very strongly.  The seasonal rituals (Solstices and Equinoxes) are Natures way of letting us know what 'time' of year it is. A time to plant and sow; a time to harvest;  a time to celebrate Earth's fertility; and a time to celebrate life!!!!    We need to be active in these....even if solitary. Do your best - don't leave anything out.  Perform a play, dress up God or Goddess statues, grow your own flowers for your alter, make your own candles, grow your own herbs.....the ideas are endless. Remember, 'you reap what you sow'.
<br><br>
To me the Wheel of the Year signifies:  completeness; the ever changing physical make up of where we live; the way we prepare different seasonal meals; beginnings and endings; the energy we put into finding just the 'right' items for each celebration (pine cones, herbs, flowers, incense). All this is wound around and through each Treguenda and Veglione, thus connecting us to it all.
<br><br>
Remember the hearth about which the family gathered (and still do) ?  The hearth provided warmth, a means of cooking, a place of gathering, a place for prayers.  Fire symbolizes protection, survival (for cooking and warmth). The  'light of fire' to me is all these things wrapped together.  In the Old days, Fire was far more of a 'survival' item.  Today, with all the modern conveniences (electricity), fire or flame is the rememberance of the Ancestors and our own personal journeys.
<br><br>
When I think of trees (any variety) I picture them with their roots wound thru the Earth. Being nourished by underground streams; taking in the Earth' and Water's nutrients to flourish and grow stong. Trees are solid...they withstand hurricanes, storms, snow, the 4 seasons of the year.  Above the ground the trees grow up to the sky, sun and moon...ever stretching their limbs and branches reaching to the heavens.  In the Wind they sway..kind of like waving 'hello' to us and perhaps the God and Goddess...letting them know they (the tree) is full of life.  Trees give joy to children: climbing; building a clubhouse in; jumping in the fallen leaves as the seasons change.  Many trees also bear fruits and nuts which they willing give to help nurture us!  Trees by Moonlight are quite beautiful. Where I live, the trees seem to 'come alive' under a Full Moon: they sway as if to talk to us.  Try meditating on a tree...talk to it...ask it questions.....and listen. When we moved here to TN there was a huge beautiful tree in our backyard.  I could sit at the base of this tree and meditate so serenely. I named it my 'grandfather tree'.  Unfortunately, the tree was very old and during the course of a storm was hit by lightening twice.....there was no choice but to cut it down.  So I made an altar out of the base of the tree (cut about 4 feet off the ground) and it is filled with the most wonderful energy.  I can sit on the tree stump and think or try to be inspired.  The tree has also provided us with wood for the winter for the fireplace and outdoor firepit; and staffs for everyone!!

What we call the Lare today, were, in early Etruscan times called the Lasa.  In La Vecchia Religione, the Lare represent not only ancient family ties, but the spirits who protect and preserve the Old Religion and its followers. The Lasa were the spirits of the West (ancestral ties) and the Lare were spirits of the East (preservation of Ways).   Lasa was the name the Etruscans gave nature spirits, those which had once been human, now moving on through their spiritual evolution.  So there was a connection to the people from the past, an ancestral connection.  Now, when we say "Lasa," we mean these nature spirits.  The Romans called them the Lare and emphasized even more their ancestral nature, connecting specifically with the collective consciousness of all their familial predecessors.  The streghe families kept this concept alive, gaining strength and aid from staying linked with the streghe that had gone before. The Lare are centered on the family and its doings and have strong ties to actual ancestors.   The Lasa are less "domestic" and their roots are in all of humanity. Once the Lare shrine has been established, you have a presence in your home.  So you would approach the shrine with the awareness that you are going to speak to a respected elder.  Light a candle and incense as a focusing act, and place a nectar offering.  Then ask for their help in the same way you would a person, clearly stating what you need assistance with and then respectfully request their aid.  Thank them at the end of this.  It's important to interact with them not only when you need help.  They should be included in birthdays and other family events, just as you would another family member. If you read up on Roman practices regarding the lare and ancestral spirits, it's pretty obvious that this was an extremely important feature of the culture.

In Stregheria we call the elements from the altar. Our first encounter  with the Watchers or Grigori is when we cast the circle. We call forth the Watchers to 'watch' or oversee the ritual and whatever workings we may be doing. We are formally  'introduced' to the Watchers at our initiation. The witch is watched and aided by the Grigori.  Every act of magick is seen and noted by the Grigori.  This does not mean that the Grigori will stop a working, we are each responsible for our actions. Just that all workings are noted and we all need to think about what we do  - before - we do it.  I personally view the Grigori as a sort of 'conscienceness' whereby I weigh the aspects for what I wish to do and the consequences thereof..  We call the Grigori to our rites so they can help us with our workings and to oversee what we are doing. By calling the Grigori we invoke the nature of that Watcher within ourselves.  They are protectors of the ritual circle.  The Grigori are of a "higher" realm and guard the portals to the gods. They were once known as the archangels, who are above the elemental rulers, too. As Strega,  we don't view the elemental rulers and the Grigori as being the same.  They're distinct entities, and the Grigori are not elemental in nature.  Rather, they might be seen as "superior" to, or supervising, the elements. Do not ever play the game of leaving it all up to higher powers to decide whether it's ok to do a working or spell.  They 'may' intervene, but the responsibility is 'entirely' yours.
<br><br>
There is much talk about the 'degree' system that many traditions use.  I do not agree with those who think they can earn a First Degree in less than 1 year....even if they have prior experience, they need to learn the way of another tradition which may be very different from the one they had previously known. The following is my own personal opinion and from my own experience.
<br><br>
A First Degree initiate (one who had decided they wish to learn more of a certain tradition; also called a dedicant) has demonstrated possession of the knowledge and skills needed to take care of his or her own spiritual needs. Also he or she must possess the basic working and hands-on knowledge of: the Elements and with basic correspondences; ability to banish, bless, and consecrate material to prepare it for ritual use; familiarity with basic magical tools; familiarity with the Wheel of the Year; ability to cast and close a Circle; ability to center, ground, and shield; become proficient in one method of divination. The usual time frame for First Degree can be anywhere from 1 - 2 years. 
<br><br>
A Second Degree initiate has demonstrated that he or she: can safely lead a magical working;  possesses the willingness and the capacity to minister to the needs of others (this includes mediating and counseling); to work within the Witch/Wiccan/Pagan community. This time frame can be another 1 -3 years.
<br><br>
A Third Degree initiate has demonstrated that he or she is competent to lead his or her own Coven or Circle. This means 'running the whole show'!! Preparing rituals, assigning duties, counseling, clergy duties.  This time frame can be another 1- 3 years.<br><br>
