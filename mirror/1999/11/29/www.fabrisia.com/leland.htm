Written by Charles G. Leland in 1899</center>  <br>

<BR><br><b>CHAPTER 1<br><BR>
HOW DIANA GAVE BIRTH TO ARADIA (HERODIUS)<br><br></center>
"It is Diana! Lo!<br>
She rises crescented."
  ~Keats' Endymion<br><br>
"Make more bright<br>
The Star Queen's crescent on her marriage night."
  ~Ibid.<br><br>
This is the Gospel (Vangelo) of the Witches:<br>
     DIANA greatly loved her brother LUCIFER, the god of the Sun and of the Moon, the god of
Light (Splendor), who was so proud of his beauty, and who for his pride was driven from
Paradise.<br>
     DIANA had by her brother a daughter, to whom they gave the name of ARADIA (i.e.
Herodius).<br>
     In those days there were on earth many rich and many poor.<br>
     The rich made slaves of the poor.<br>
     In those days were many slaves who were cruelly treated; in every palace tortures, in every
castle prisoners.<br>
     Many slaves escaped.  They fled to the country; thus they became thieves and evil folk. 
Instead of sleeping by nigh, they plotted escape and robbed their masters, and then slew them.  So
they dwelt in the mountains and forests as robbers and assassins, all to avoid slavery.<br>
     DIANA said one day to her daughter ARADIA:<br>
          'Tis true indeed that thou a spirit art,<br>
          But thou wert born but to become again <br>
          A mortal; thou must go to earth below <br>
          To be a teacher unto women and men <br>
          Who fain would study witchcraft in thy school <br><br>
          Yet like Cain's daughter thou shalt never be <br>
          Nor like the race who have become at last <br>
          Wicked and infamous from suffering,<br>
          As are the Jews and wandering Zingari,<br>
          Who are all thieves and knaves; like unto them <br>
          Ye shall not be...<br><br><br>
          And thou shalt be the first of witches known;<br>
          And thou shalt be the first of all I' the world;<br>
          And thou shalt teach the art of poisoning,<br>
          Of poisoning those who are great lords of all;<br>
          Yea, thou shalt make them die in their palaces;<br>
          And thou shalt bind the oppressor's soul (with power);<br>
          And when ye find a peasant who is rich,<br>
          Then ye shall teach the witch, your pupil, how <br>
          To ruin all his crops with tempests dire, <br>
          With lightning and with thunder (terrible),<br>
          And with the hail and wind...<br><br>
          And when a priest shall do you injury <br>
          By his benedictions, ye shall do to him <br>
          Double the harm, and do it in the name <br>
          of me, Diana, Queen of witches all!<br><br>
          And when the priests or the nobility <br>
          shall say to you that you should put your faith <br>
          In the Father, Son, and Mary, then reply;<br>
          "Your God, the Father, and Maria are <br>
          Three devils..."<br><br>
          "For the true God the Father is not yours;<br>
          For I have come to sweep away the bad <br>
          The men of evil, all will I destroy!"<br><br>
          "Ye who are poor suffer with hunger keen,<br>
          And toil in wretchedness, and suffer too <br>
          Full oft imprisonment; yet with it all <br>
          Ye have a soul, and for your sufferings <br>
          Ye shall be happy in the other world,<br>
          But ill the fate of all who do ye wrong!"<br><br>
     Now when ARADIA had been taught, taught to work all witchcraft, how to destroy the evil
race (of oppressors), she (imparted it to her pupils) and said unto them:<br><br>
          When I shall have departed from this world,<br>
          Whenever ye have need of anything,<br>
          Once in the month, and when the moon is full,<br>
          Ye shall assemble in some desert place,<br>
          Or in a forest all together join <br>
          To adore the potent spirit of your queen,<br>
          My mother, great <i>Diana</i>.  She who fain <br>
          Would learn all sorcery yet has not won <br>
          Its deepest secrets, then my mother will <br>
          Teach her, in truth all things as yet unknown <br>.
          And ye shall all be freed from slavery,<br>
          And so ye shall be free in everything;<br>
          And as the sign that ye are truly free, <br>
          Ye shall be naked in your rites, both men <br>
          And women also:  this shall last until <br>
          The last of your oppressors shall be dead;<br>
          And ye shall make the game of Benevento <br>
          Extinguishing the lights, and after that <br>
          Shall hold your supper thus:<br>

THE SABBAT, TREGUENDA OR WITCH-MEETING -<br>
     HOW  TO CONSECRATE THE SUPPER <br>
<br>Here follows the supper, of what it must consist, and what shall be said and done to consecrate it
to DIANA.<br><br> You shall take meal and salt, honey and water, and make this incantation:<br>
<br>The Conjuration of Meal <br>
<br>
          I conjure thee, O Meal!<br>
          Who art indeed our body, since without thee <br>
          We could not live, thou who (at first as seed)<br>
          Before becoming flower went in the earth, <br>
          Where all deep secrets hide, and then when ground <br>
          Didst dance like dust in the wind, and yet meanwhile <br>
          Didst bear with thee in flitting, secrets strange!<br><br>
          And yet erewhile, when thou were in the ear,<br>
          Even as a (golden) glittering grain, even then <br>
          The fireflies came to cast on thee their light <br>
          And aid thy growth, because without their help <br>
          Thou couldst not grow nor beautiful become;<br>
          Therefore thou dost belong unto the race <br>
          Of witches or of fairies, and because <br>
          The fireflies do belong unto the sun...<br><br><br>
          Queen of the fireflies!  hurry apace,<br>
          Come to me now as if running a race,<br>
          Bridle the horse as you hear me now sing!<br>
          Bridle, O bridle the son of the king!<br>
          Come in a hurry and bring him to me!<br>
          The son of the king will ere long set thee free!<br>
          And because thou for ever art brilliant and fair,<br>
          Under a glass I will keep thee; while there, <br>
          With a lens I will study they secrets concealed,<br>
          Till all their bright mysteries are fully revealed,<br>
          Yea, all the wondrous lore perplexed <br>
          Of this life of our cross and of the next.<br>
          Thus to all mysteries I shall attain,<br>
          Yea, even to that at last of the grain;<br>
          And when this at last I shall truly know,<br>
          Firefly, freely I'll let thee go!<br>
          When Earth's dark secrets are known to me,<br>
          My blessing at last I will give to thee!<br><br>
     Here follows the Conjuration of the Salt.<br><br>
Conjuration of the Salt <br><br>
          I do conjure thee, salt, lo! here at noon,<br>
          Exactly in the middle of a stream <br>
          I take my place and see the water around,<br>
          Likewise the sun, and think of nothing else <br>
          While here besides the water and the sun;<br>
          For all my soul is turned in truth to them;<br>
          I do indeed desire no other thought,<br>
          I yearn to learn the very truth of truths,<br>
          For I have suffered long with the desire <br>
          To know my future or my coming fate,<br>
          If good or evil will prevail in it..<br>
          Water and sun, be gracious unto me!<br><br>
     Here follows the Conjuration of Cain.<br><br>
The Conjuration of Cain <br><br>
          I conjure thee, O Cain, as thou canst ne'er <br>
          Have rest or peace until thou shalt be freed <br>
          From the sun where thou art prisoned, and must go <br>
          beating thy hands and running fast meanwhile:<br>
          I pray thee let me know my destiny;<br>
          And it 'tis evil, change its course for me!<br>
          If thou wilt grant this grace, I'll see it clear <br>
          In the water in the splendor of the sun;<br>
          And thou, O Cain, shalt tell by word of mouth <br>
          Whatever this my destiny is to be.<br>
          And unless thou grantest this, <br>
          May'st thou ne'er know peace or bliss!<br><br>
Then shall follow the Conjuration of Diana.<br><br>
     You shall make cakes of meal, wine, salt, and honey in the shape of a (crescent or horned)
moon, and then put them to bake, and say:<br><br> <br>
          I do not bake the bread, nor with it salt,<br>
          Nor do I cook the honey with the wine;<br>
          I bake the body and the blood and soul,<br>
          The soul of (great) Diana, that she shall <br>
          Know neither rest nor peace, and ever be <br>
          In cruel suffering till she will grant <br>
          What I request, what I do most desire,<br>
          I beg it of her from my very heart!<br>
          And if the grace be granted, O Diana!<br>
          In honor of thee I will hold this feast,<br>
          Feast and drain the goblet deep,<br>
          We will dance and wildly leap,<br>
          And if thou grant'st the grace which I require,<br>
          Then when the dance is wildest, all the lamps <br>
          shall be extinguished and we'll freely love!<br><br>
     And thus shall it be done:  all shall sit down to the supper all naked, men and women, and
the feast over, they shall dance, sing, make music, and then love in the darkness, with all the lights
extinguished; for it is the Spirit of DIANA who extinguishes them, and so they will dance and make
music in her praise.<br>
     And it came to pass that DIANA, after her daughter had accomplished her mission or spent
her time on earth among the living (mortals), recalled her, and gave her the power that when she
had been invoked...having done some good deed...she gave her the power to gratify those who had
conjured her by granting her or him success in love:<br><br>
          To bless or curse with power friends or enemies (to do good or evil).<br>
          To converse with spirits.<br>
          To find hidden treasures in ancient ruins.<br>
          To conjure the spirits of priests who died leaving treasures.<br>
          To understand the voice of the wind.<br>
          To change water into wine.<br>
          To divine with cards.<br>
          To know the secrets of the hand (palmistry)<br>
          To cure diseases.<br>
          To make those who are ugly beautiful.<br>
          To tame wild beasts.<br><br>
     And whatever thing should be asked from the spirit of Aradia, that should be granted unto
those who merited her favor.<br>
     And thus must they invoke her:<br><br><br>
Thus do I seek Aradia! Aradia! Aradia!  At midnight, at midnight I go into a field, and with me I
bear water, wine, and salt, I bear water, wine, and salt, and my talisman - my talisman, my
talisman, and a red small bag which I ever hold in my hand - con dentro, con dentro, sale, with salt
in it, in it.  With water and wine I bless myself, I bless myself with devotion to implore a favour
from Aradia, Aradia.  (emphasize italics and repetitions)<br><br>
Invocation to Aradia <br><br>
          Aradia! my Aradia!<br>
          Thou art my daughter unto him who was <br>
          Most evil of all spirits, who of old <br>
          Once reigned in hell when driven away from heaven,<br>
          Who by his sister did thy sire become,<br>
          But as thy mother did repent her fault,<br>
          And wished to mate thee to a spirit who <br>
          Should be benevolent,<br>
          And not malevolent!<br><br>
          Aradia, Aradia!  I implore <br>
          Thee by the love which she did bear for thee!<br>
          And by the love which I too feel for thee!<br>
          I pray thee grant the grace which I require!<br>
          And if this grace be granted, may there be <br>
          One of three signs distinctly clear to me:<br>
               The hiss of a serpent,<br>
               The light of a firefly,<br>
               The sound of a frog!<br><br>
          But if you do refuse this favour, then <br>
          May you in future know no peace nor joy,<br>
          And be obliged to seek me from afar,<br>
          Until you come to grant me my desire,<br>
          In haste, and then thou may'st return again <br>
          Unto thy destiny.  Therewith, Amen!<br><br><BR>

<center>CHAPTER III <br><br>HOW DIANA MADE THE STARS AND THE RAIN <br></center><br>
     DIANA was the first created before all creation; in her were all things; our of herself, the first
darkness, she divided herself; into darkness and light she was divided.  Lucifer, her brother and
son, herself and her other half, was the light.<br>
     And when DIANA saw that the light was so beautiful, the light which was her other half, her
brother Lucifer, she yearned for it with exceeding great desire.  Wishing to receive the light again
into her darkness, to swallow it up in rapture, in delight, she trembled with desire.  This desire was
the dawn.<br>
     But Lucifer, the light, fled from her, and would not yield to her wishes; he was the light
which flies into the most distant parts of heaven, the mouse which flies before the cat.<br>
     Then DIANA went to the fathers of the Beginning, to the mothers, the spirits who were
before the first spirit, and lamented unto them that she could not prevail with Lucifer.  And they
praised her for her courage; they told her that to rise she must fall; to become the chief of
goddesses she must become mortal.<br>
     And in the ages, in the course of time, when the world was made, Diana went on earth, as
did Lucifer, who had fallen, and DIANA taught magic and sorcery, whence came witches and fairies
and goblins - all that is like man, yet not mortal.<br>
     And it came thus that DIANA took the form of a cat.  Her brother had a cat whom he loved
beyond all creatures, and it slept every night on his bed, a cat beautiful beyond all other creatures,
a fairy: he did not know it.<br>
     DIANA prevailed with the cat to change forms with her; so she lay with her brother, and in
the darkness assumed her own form, and so by Lucifer became the mother of Aradia.  But when
in the morning he found that he lay by his sister, and that light had been conquered by darkness,
Lucifer was extremely angry; but Diana with her wiles of witchcraft so charmed him that he
yielded to her love.  This was the first fascination; she hummed the song, it was as the buzzing of
bees (or a top spinning round), a spinning-wheel spinning life.  She spun the lives of all men; all
things were spun from the wheel of DIANA.  Lucifer turned the wheel.<br>
     DIANA was not known to the witches and spirits, the fairies and elves who dwell in desert
place, the goblins, as their mother; she hid herself in humility and was a mortal, but by her will she
rose again above all.  She had passion for witchcraft, and became so powerful therein, that her
greatness could not be hidden.<br>
     And thus it came to pass one night, at the meeting of all the sorceresses and fairies, she
declared that she would darken the heavens and turn all the stars into mice.<br>
     All those who were present said - <br>
     "If thou canst do such a strange thing, having risen to such power, thou shalt be our
queen."<br>
     DIANA went into the street; she took the bladder of an ox and a piece of witch-money,
which has an edge from a knife - with such money witches cut the earth from men's foot tracks -
and she cut the earth, and with it and many mice she filled the bladder, and blew into the bladder
till it burst.<br>
     And there came a great marvel, for the earth which was in the bladder became the round
heaven above, and for three days there was a great rain; the mice became stars or rain.  And
having made the heaven and stars and the rain, DIANA became Queen of the Witches; she was the
cat who ruled the star mice, the heaven and the rain.<br>

<center>CHAPTER IV <br><br>THE CHARM OF THE STONES CONSECRATED TO DIANA <br></center>
<br>     To find a stone with a hole in it is a special sign of the favour of DIANA.  He who does so
shall take it in his hand and repeat the following, having observed the ceremony as enjoined - <br><br>
Invocation to the Holy-Stone <br><br>
          I have found <br>
          A holy-stone upon the ground.<br>
          O Fate! I thank thee for the happy find.<br>
          Also the spirit who upon this road <br>
          Hath given it to me;<br>
          And may it prove to be for my true good <br>
          And my good fortune!<br><br>
          I rise in the morning by the earliest dawn,<br>
          And I go forth to walk through (pleasant) vales,<br>
          All in the mountains or the meadows fair,<br>
          Seeking for luck while onward still I roam,<br>
          Seeking for rue and vervain scented sweet,<br>
          Because they bring good fortune unto all.<br>
          I keep them safely guarded in my bosom,<br>
          That none may know it - 'tis a secret thing,<br>
          And sacred too, and thus I speak the spell:<br>
          "O vervain! ever be a benefit,<br>
          And may thy blessing be upon the witch <br>
          Or on the fairy who did give thee to me!"<br><br>
          It was Diana who did come to me,<br>
          All in the night in a dream, and said to me:<br>
          "If thou would'st keep all evil folk afar,<br>
          Then ever keep the vervain and the rue <br>
          Safely beside thee!"<br><br>
          Great Diana! thou <br>
          Who art the queen of heaven and of earth,<br>
          And of the infernal lands - yea, thou who art <br>
          Protectress of all men unfortunate,<br>
          Of thieves and murderers, and of women too <br>
          Who lead an evil life, and yet hast known <br>
          That their nature was not evil, thou, Diana <br>
          Hast still conferred on them some joy in life.<br><br>
          Or I may truly at another time <br>
          So conjure thee that thou shalt have no peace <br>
          Or happiness, for thou shalt ever be <br>
          In suffering until thou greatest that <br>
          Which I require in strictest faith from thee!<br><br>
     [Here we have again the threatening the deity, just as in Eskimo or other Shamanism,
which represents the rudest primitive form of conjuring, the spirits are menaced.  A trace of this is
to be found among rude Roman Catholics.  Thus when St. Bruno, some years ago, at a town in
the Romagna, did not listen to the prayers of his devotees for rain, they stuck his image in the mud
of the river, head downwards.  A rain speedily followed, and the saint was restored in honour to
his place in the church..]<br><br>
The Spell or Conjuration of the Round Stone <br><br>
     The finding of a round stone, be it great or small, is a good sign, but it should never be
given away, because the receiver will then get the good luck, and some disaster befall the
giver.<br>
     On finding a round stone, raise the eyes to heaven, and throw the stone up three times
(catching it every time), and say - <br><br>
          Spirit of good omen,<br>
          Who art come to aid me,<br>
          Believe I had great need of thee.<br>
          Spirit of the Red Goblin,<br>
          Since thou hast come to aid me in my need,<br>
          I pray of thee do not abandon me;<br>
          I beg of thee to enter now this stone,<br>
          That in my pocket I may carry thee, <br>
          And so when anything is needed by me,<br>
          I can call unto thee: be what it may,<br>
          Do not abandon me by night or day.<br><br>
          Should I lend money unto any man <br>
          Who will not pay when due, I pray of thee,<br>
          Thou the Red Goblin, make him pay his debt!<br>
          And if he will not and is obstinant,<br>
          Go at him with thy cry of "Brie - brie!"<br>
          And if he sleeps, awake him with a twitch,<br>
          And pull the covering off and frighten him!<br>
          And follow him about where'er he goes.<br><br><br><br>
          So teach him with thy ceaseless "Brie - brie!"<br>
          That he who obligation e'er forgets <br>
          Shall be in trouble till he pays his debts.<br>
          And so my debtor on the following day <br>
          Shall either bring the money which he owes,<br>
          Or send it promptly: so I pray of thee,<br>
          O my Red Goblin, come unto my aid!<br>
          Or should I quarrel with her whom I love,<br>
          Then, spirit of good luck, I pray thee go <br>
          To her while sleeping - pull her by the hair,<br>
          And bear her through the night unto my bed!<br>
          And in the morning, when all spirits go <br>
          To their repose, do thou, ere thou return'st <br>
          Into thy stone, carry her home again,<br>
          And leave her there asleep.  Therefore, O Sprite!<br>
          I beg thee in this pebble make thy home!<br>
          Obey in every way all I command.<br>
          So in my pocket thou shalt ever be,<br>
          And thou and I will ne'er part company!<br><br><BR>

<center>CHAPTER V <br><br>THE CONJURATION OF THE LEMON AND PINS <br><br></center><br>
Sacred to Diana <br><br>
     A lemon stuck full of pins of different colours always brings good fortune.<br>
     If you receive as a gift a lemon full of pins of divers colours, without any black ones among
them, it signifies that your life will be perfectly happy and prosperous and joyful.<br>
     But if some black pins are among them, you may enjoy good fortune and health, yet
mingled with troubles which may be of small account.  [However, to lessen their influence, you
must perform the following ceremony, and pronounce this incantation, wherein all is also
described.<br><br>
          At the instant when the midnight came,<br>
          I have picked a lemon in the garden,<br>
          I have picked a lemon, and with it <br>
          An orange and a (fragrant) mandarin.<br>
          Gathering with care these (precious) things,<br>
          And while gathering I said with care:<br>
          "Thou who art Queen of the sun and of the moon <br>
          And of the stars - lo! here I call to thee!<br>
          And with what power I have I conjure thee <br>
          To grant to me the favour I implore!<br>
          Three things I've gathered in the garden here:<br>
          A lemon, orange, and a mandarin;<br>
          I've gathered them to bring good luck to me.<br>
          Two of them I do grasp here in my hand,<br>
          And that which is to serve me for my fate,<br>
          Queen of the stars!<br>
          Then make that fruit remain firm in my grasp.<br><br>
     [Something is here omitted in the MS.  I conjecture that the two are tossed without seeing
them into the air, and if the lemon remains, the ceremony proceeds as follows.  This is evident,
since in it the incantation is confused with a prose direction how to act]<br><br>
     Saying this, one looks up at the sky, and I found the lemon in one hand, and a voice said to
me - <br>
     "Take many pins, and carefully stick them in the lemon, pins of many colours; and as thou
wilt have good luck, and if thou desirest to give the lemon to any one or to a friend, thou shouldst
stick in it many pins of varied colours.<br>
     "But if thou wilt that evil befall any one, put in it black pins.<br>
     "But for this thou must pronounce a different incantation (thus)":<br><br><br>
          Goddess Diana, I do conjure thee <br>
          And with uplifted voice to thee I call,<br>
          That thou shalt never have content or peace <br>
          Until thou comest to give me all thy aid.<br>
          Therefore tomorrow at the stoke of noon <br>
          I'll wait for thee, bearing a cup of wine,<br>
          Therewith a lens or a small burning glass.<br>
          And thirteen pins I'll put into the charm;<br>
          Those which I put shall all indeed be black,<br>
          But thou, Diana, thou wilt place them all!<br><br>
          And thou shalt call for me the fiends from hell;<br>
          Thou'lt send them as companions of the Sun,<br>
          And all the fire infernal of itself <br>

          Those fiends shall bring, and bring with it the power <br>
          Unto the Sun to make this (red) wine boil,<br>
          So that these pins by heat may be red-hot;<br>
          And with them I do fill the lemon here,<br>
          That unto her or him to whom 'tis given <br>
          Peace and prosperity shall be unknown.<br><br>
          If this grace I gain from thee <br>
          Give a sign, I pray, to me!<br>
          Ere the third day shall pass away,<br>
          Let me either hear or see <br>
          A roaring wind, a rattling rain,<br>
          Or hail a clattering on the plain;<br>
          Till one of these three signs you show,<br>
          Peace, Diana, thou shalt not know.<br>
          Answer well the prayer I've sent thee,<br>
          Or day and night will I torment thee!<br><br>
     As the orange was the fruit of the Sun, so is the lemon suggestive of the Moon or DIANA,
its colour being of a lighter yellow.  However, the lemon specially chosen for the charm is always a
green one, because it "sets hard" and turns black.  It is not generally known that orange and lemon
peel, subjected to pressure and combined with an adhesive may be made into a hard substance
which can be moulded or used for many purposes.  I have devoted a chapter to this in an as yet
unpublished work entitled One Hundred Minor Arts.  This was suggested to me by the hardened
lemon given to me for a charm by a witch.<br><br><BR>
<HR>
<center>CHAPTER VI <br><br>A SPELL TO WIN LOVE <br></center><br>
     When a wizard, a worshipper of DIANA, one who worships the Moon, desires the love of a
woman, he can change her into the form of a dog, when she, forgetting who she is, and all things
besides, will at once come to his house, and there, when by him, take on again her natural form
and remain with him.  And when it is time for her to depart, she will again become a dog and go
home, where she will turn into a girl.  And she will remember nothing of what has taken place, or
at least but little or mere fragments, which will seem as a confused dream.  And she will take the
form of a dog because DIANA has ever a dog by her side.<br>
     And this is the spell to be repeated by him who would bring a love to his home.<br><br>
     (The beginning of this spell seems to be merely a prose introduction explaining the nature
of the ceremony)<br><br>
     Today is Friday, and I wish to rise very early, not having been able to sleep all night,
having seen a very beautiful girl, the daughter of a rich lord, whom I dare not hope to win.  Were
she poor, I could gain her with money; but as she is rich, I have no hope to do so.  Therefore will I
conjure Diana to aid me.<br><br>
          Diana, beautiful Diana!<br>
          Who art indeed as good as beautiful,<br>
          By all the worship I have given thee,<br>
          And all the joy of love which thou hast known,<br>
          I do implore thee to aid me in my love!<br>
          What thou wilt 'tis true <br>
          Thou canst ever do:<br>
          And if the grace I seek thou'lt grant to me,<br>
          Then call, I pray, they daughter Aradia,<br>
          And send her to the bedside of the girl,<br>
          And give that girl the likeness of a dog,<br>
          And make her then come to me in my room,<br>
          But when she once has entered it, I pray <br>
          That she may reassume her human form,<br>
          As beautiful as e'er she was before,<br>
          And may I then make love to her until <br>
          Our souls with joy are fully satisfied.<br>
          Then by the aid of the great Fairy Queen <br>
          And of her daughter, fair Aradia,<br>
          May she be turned into a dog again,<br>
          And then to human form as once before!<br><br>
     Thus it will come to pass that the girl as a dog will return to her home unseen and
unsuspected, for thus will it be affected by Aradia; and the girl will think it is all a dream, because
she will have been enchanted by Aradia.<br><br><BR>
<HR>
<center>CHAPTER VII <br><br>TO FIND OR BUY ANYTHING, OR TO HAVE GOOD FORTUNE THEREBY <br><br>
</center>
     The man or woman who, when about to go forth into the town, would fain be free from
danger or risk of an accident, or to have good fortune in buying, as, for instance, if a scholar hopes
that he may find some rare old book or manuscript for sale very cheaply, or if any one wishes to
buy anything very desirable or to find bargains or rarities.  This scongiurazione serves for good
health, cheerfulness of heart, and absence of evil or the overcoming enmity.  These are words of
gold unto the believer.<br><br>
          'Tis Tuesday now, and at an early hour <br>
          I fain would turn good fortune to myself,<br>
          Firstly at home and then when I go forth,<br>
          And with the aid of beautiful Diana <br>
          I pray for luck ere I do leave this house!<br><br>
          First with three drops of oil I do remove <br>
          All evil influence, and I humbly pray,<br>
          O beautiful Diana, unto thee <br>
          That thou wilt take it all away from me,<br>
          And send it all to my worst enemy!<br><br>
          When the evil fortune <br>
          Is taken from me,<br>
          I'll cast it out to the middle of the street <br>
          And if thou wilt grant me this favour,<br>
          O beautiful Diana, <br>
          Every bell in my house shall merrily ring!<br><br>
          Then well contented <br>
          I will go forth to roam,<br>
          Because I shall be sure that with thy aid <br>
          I shall discover ere I return <br>
          Some fine and ancient books,<br>
          And at a moderate price.<br><br>
          And thou shalt find the man,<br>
          The one who owns the book,<br>
          And thou thyself wilt go <br>
          And put it in his mind,<br>
          Inspiring him to know <br>
          What 'tis that thou would'st find <br>
          And move him into doing <br>
          All that thou dost require.<br>
          Or if a manuscript <br>
          Written in ancient days,<br>
          Thou'lt gain it all the same,<br>
          It shall come in thy way,<br>
          And thus at little cost.<br>
          Thou shalt buy what thou wilt <br>
          By great Diana's aid.<br><br>
     The foregoing was obtained, after some delay, in reply to a query as to what conjuration
would be required before going forth, to make sure that one should find for sale some rare book,
or other object desired, at a very moderate price.  Therefore the invocation has been so worded as
to make it applicable to literary finds; but those who wish to buy anything whatever on equally
favorable terms, have but to vary the request, retaining the introduction, in which the magic virtue
consists.  I cannot, however, resist the conviction that this is most applicable to, and will succeed
best with, researches for objects of antiquity, scholarship, and art, and it should accordingly be
deeply impressed on the memory of every bric-a-brac hunter and bibliographer.  It should be
observed, and that earnestly, that the prayer, far from being answered, will turn to the contrary or
misfortune, unless the one who repeats it does so in fullest faith, and this cannot be acquired by
merely saying to oneself, "I believe."  For to acquire real faith in anything requires long and serious
mental discipline, there being, in fact, no subject which is so generally spoken of and so little
understood.  Here indeed, I am speaking seriously, for the man who can train his faith to actually
believe in and cultivate or develop his will can really work what the world by common consent
regards as miracles.  A time will come when this principle will form not only the basis of all
education, but also that of all moral and social culture.  I have, I trust, fully set it forth in a work
entitled "Have you a Strong Will? or how to Develop it or any other Faculty or Attribute of the
Mind, and render it Habitual," &c. London: George Redway.<br>
     The reader, however, who has devout faith, can, as the witches declare, apply this spell
daily before going forth to procuring or obtaining any kind of bargains at shops, to picking up or
discovering lost objects, or, in fact, to finds of any kind.  If he incline to beauty in female form, he
will meet with bonnes fortunes; if a man of business, bargains will be his.  The botanist who
repeats it before going into the fields will probably discover some new plant, and the astronomer
by night be almost certain to run against a brand new planet, or at least an asteroid.  It should be
repeated before going to the races, to visit friends, places of amusement, to buy or sell, to make
speeches, and specially before hunting or any nocturnal goings-forth, since DIANA is the goddess of
the chase and of night.  But woe to him who does it for a jest!<br><br><BR>
<HR>
<center>CHAPTER VIII <br><br>TO HAVE A GOOD WINE AND VERY GOOD WINE BY THE AID OF DIANA <br>
<br></center>
     He who would have a good vintage and fine wine, should take a horn full of wine and with
this go into the vineyards or farms wherever vines grow, and then drinking from the horn say -
<br><br>
          I drink, and yet it is not wine I drink,<br>
          I drink the blood of Diana,<br>
          Since from wine it has changed into her blood,<br>
          And spread itself through all my growing vines,<br>
          Whence it will give me good return in wines,<br>
          Though even if good vintage should be mine,<br>
          I'll be free from care, for should it chance <br>
          That the grape ripens in the waning moon,<br>
          Then all the wine would come to sorrow, but <br>
          If drinking from this horn I drink the blood - <br>
          The blood of great Diana - by her aid - <br>
          If I do kiss my hand to the new moon,<br>
          Praying the Queen that she will guard my grapes,<br>
          Even from the instant when the bud is born <br>
          Until it is a ripe and perfect grape,<br>
          And onward to the vintage, and to the last <br>
          Until the wine is made - may it be good!<br>
          And may it so succeed that I from it <br>
          May draw good profit when at last 'tis sold,<br>
          So may good fortune come unto my vines,<br>
          And into all my land where'er it be!<br>
          But should my vines seem in an evil way,<br>
          I'll take my horn, and bravely will I blow <br>
          In the wine-vault at midnight, and I'll make <br>
          Such a tremendous and a terrible sound <br>
          That thou, Diana fair, however far <br>
          Away thou may'st be, still shalt hear the call,<br>
          And casting open door or window wide,<br>
          Shalt headlong come upon the rushing wind,<br>
          And find and save me - that is, save my vines,<br>
          Which will be saving me from dire distress;<br>
          For should I lose them I'd be lost myself,<br>
          But with thy aid, Diana, I'll be saved.<br><br>
     This is a very interesting invocation and tradition, and probably of great antiquity from very
striking intrinsic evidence.  For it is firstly devoted to a subject which has received little attention -
the connection of DIANA as the moon with Bacchus, although in the great Dizionario Storico
Mitologico, by Pozzoli and others, it is expressly asserted that in Greece her worship was
associated with that of Bacchus, Esculapius and Apollo.  The connecting link is the horn.  In a
medal of Alexander Severus, Diana of Ephesus bears the horn of plenty.  This is the horn or horn
of the new moon, sacred to DIANA.  According to Callimachus, Apollo himself built an altar
consisting entirely of horns to DIANA.<br>
     The connection of the horn with wine is obvious.  It was usual among the old Slavonians
for the priest of Svantevit, the Sun god, to see if the horn which the idol held in his hand was full
of wine, in order to prophesy a good harvest for the coming year.  If it was filled, all was right; if
not, he filled the horn, drank from it, and replaced the horn in the hand, and predicted that all
would eventually go well.  It cannot fail to strike the reader that this ceremony is strangely like that
of the Italian invocation, the only difference being that in one the Sun, and in the other the Moon
is invoked to secure a good harvest.<br>
     In the 'Legends of Florence' there is one of the Via del Corno, in which the hero, falling
into a vast tun or tina of wine, is saved from drowning by sounding a horn with tremendous
power.  At the sound, which penetrates to an incredible distance, even to unknown lands, all came
rushing as if enchanted to save him.  In this conjuration, DIANA, in the depths of heaven, is
represented as rushing at the sound of the horn, and leaping through doors or windows to save the
vintage of the one who blows.  There is a certain singular affinity in these stories.<br>
     In the story of the Via del Corno, the hero is saved by the Red Goblin or Robin
Goodfellow, who gives him a horn, and it is the same sprite who appears in the conjuration of the
Round Stone, which is sacred to DIANA.  This is because the spirit is nocturnal, and attendant on
Diana-Titania.<br>
     Kissing the hand to the new moon is a ceremony of unknown antiquity, and Job, even in
his time, regarded it as heathenish and forbidden - which always means antiquated and out of
fashion - as when he declared (xxxi, 26, 27), "If I beheld the moon walking in brightness...and my
heart hath been secretly enticed or my mouth hath kissed my hand...this also were an iniquity to be
punished by the Judge, for I should have denied the God that is above."  From which it may or
ought to be inferred that Job did not understand that God made the moon and appeared in all His
works, or else he really believed the moon was an independent deity.  In any case, it is curious to
see the old forbidden rite still living, and as heretical as ever.<br>
     The tradition, as given to me, very evidently omits a part of the ceremony, which may be
supplied from classic authority.  When the peasant performs the rite, he must not act as once a
certain African, who was a servant of a friend of mine, did.  The man's duty was to pour out every
morning a libation of rum to a fetish - and he poured it down his own throat.  The peasant should
also sprinkle the vines, just as the Devonshire farmers who observed all Christmas ceremonies,
sprinkled, also from a horn, their apple trees.<br><br><BR>

<center>CHAPTER IX <br><br>TANA AND ENDAMONE, OR DIANA AND ENDYMION <br></center>     <br>
     "Now it is fabled that Endymion, admitted to Olympus, whence he was expelled for
     want of respect to Juno, was banished for thirty years to earth.  And having been
     allowed to sleep this time in a cave of Mount Latmos, Diana, smitten with his beauty
     visited him every night till she had by him fifty daughters and one son.  And after
     this Endymion was recalled to Olympus."<br> -Diz. Stor. Mitol <br><br>
     The following legend and the spells were given under the name or title of TANA.  This
was the old Etruscan name for DIANA, which is still preserved in the Romagna Toscana.  In more
than one Italian and French work I have found some account or tale how a witch charmed a girl to
sleep for a lover, but this is the only explanation of the whole ceremony known to me.<br><br>
<center>TANA <br><br></center>
     Tana is a beautiful goddess, and she loved a marvelously handsome youth names
Endamone; but her love was crossed by a witch who was her rival, although Endamone did not
care for the latter.<br>
     But the witch resolved to win him, whether he would or not, and with this intent she
induced the servant of Endamone to let her pass the night in the latter's room.  And when there,
she assumed the appearance of Tana, whom he loved, so that he was delighted to behold her, as
he thought, and welcomed her with passionate embraces.  Yet this gave him into her power, for it
enabled her to perform a certain  magic spell by clipping a lock of his hair.<br>
     Then she went home, and taking a piece of sheep's intestine, formed of it a purse, and in
this she put that which she had taken, with a red and a black ribbon bound together, with a feather,
and pepper and salt, and then sang a song.  These are the words, a song of witchcraft of the very
old time.<br><br>
          This bag for Endamon' I wove,<br>
          It is my vengeance for the love,<br>
          For the deep love I had for thee,<br>
          Which thou would'st not return to me,<br>
          But bore it all to Tana's shrine,<br>
          And Tana never shall be thine!<br>
          Now every night in agony <br>
          By me thou shalt oppressed be!<br>
          From day to day, from hour to hour,<br>
          I'll make thee feel the witch's power;<br>
          With passion thou shalt be tormented,<br>
          And yet with pleasure ne'er be contented;<br>
          Enwrapped in slumber thou shalt lie,<br>
          To know that thy beloved is by,<br>
          And, ever dying, never die,<br>
          Without the power to speak a word,<br>
          Nor shall her voice by thee be heard;<br>
          Tormented by Love's agony,<br>
          There shall be no relief for thee!<br>
          For my strong spell thou canst not break,<br>
          And from that sleep thou ne'er shalt wake;<br>
          Little by little thou shalt waste,<br>
          Like taper by the embers placed.<br>
          Little by little thou shalt die,<br>
          Yet, ever living, tortured lie,<br>
          Strong in desire, yet ever weak,<br>
          Without the power to move or speak,<br>
          With all the love I had for thee,<br>
          Shalt thou thyself tormented be,<br>
          Since all the love I felt of late <br>
          I'll make thee feel in burning hate,<br>
          For ever on thy torture bent,<br>
          I am revenged, and now content.<br><br>
     But Tana, who was far more powerful than the witch, though not able to break the spell by
which he was compelled to sleep, took from him all pain (he knew her in dreams), and embracing
him, she sang this counter charm.<br><br>
          Endamone, Endamone, Endamone!<br>
          By the love I feel, which I <br>
          Shall ever feel until I die,<br>
          Three crosses on thy bed I make,<br>
          And then three wild horse chestnuts take,<br>
          In that bed the nuts I hide,<br>
          And then the window open wide,<br>
          That the full moon may cast her light <br>
          Upon the love as fair and bright,<br>
          And so I pray to her above <br>
          To give wild rapture to our love,<br>
          And cast her fire in either heart,<br>
          Which wildly loves to never part;<br>
          And one thing more I beg of thee!<br>
          If any one enamoured be,<br>
          And in my aid his love hath placed,<br>
          Unto his call I'll come in haste.<br><br>
     So it came to pass that the fair goddess made love with Endamone as if they had been
awake (yet communing in dreams).  And so it is to this day, that whoever would make love with
him or her who sleeps, should have recourse to the beautiful Tana, and so doing there will be
success.<br><br>
     This legend, while agreeing in many details with the classical myth, is strangely
intermingled with practices of witchcraft, but even these, if investigated, would all prove to be as
ancient as the rest of the text.  Thus the sheep's intestine - used instead of the red woolen bag
which is employed in beneficent magic - the red and black ribbon, which mingles threads of joy
and woe, the (peacock) feather, pepper and salt, occur in many other incantations, but always to
bring evil and cause suffering.<br>
     I have never seen it observed, but it is true, that Keats in his exquisite poem of Endymion
completely departs from or ignores the whole spirit and meaning of the ancient myth, while in this
rude witch-song it is minutely developed.  The conception is that of a beautiful youth furtively
kissed in his slumber by DIANA of reputed chastity.  The ancient myth is, to begin with, one of
darkness and light, or day and night, from which are born the fifty-one (now fifty-two) weeks of
the year.  This is DIANA, the night, and Apollo, the sun, or light in another form.  It is expressed as
love-making during sleep, which, when it occurs in real life, generally has for active agent some
one who, without being absolutely modest, wishes to preserve appearances.  The established
character of DIANA among the Initiated (for which she was bitterly reviled by the Fathers of the
Church) was that of a beautiful hypocrite who pursued amours in silent secrecy.<br>
          "Thus as the moon Endymion lay with her,<br>
          So did Hippolytus and Verbio."<br>
     But there is an exquisitely subtle, delicately strange idea or ideal in the conception of the
apparently chaste "clear, cold moon" casting her living light by stealth into the hidden recesses of
darkness and acting in the occult mysteries of love or dreams.  So it struck Byron as an original
thought that the sun does not shine on half the forbidden deeds which the moon witnesses, and this
is emphasized in the Italian  witch-poem.  In it the moon is distinctly invoked as the protectress of a
strange and secret amour, and as the deity to be especially invoked for such love-making.  The one
invoking says that the window is opened, that the moon may shine splendidly on the bed, even as
our love is bright and beautiful...and I pray her to give great rapture to us.<br>
     The quivering, mysteriously beautiful light of the moon, which seems to cast a spirit of
intelligence or emotion over silent Nature, and dimly half awaken it - raising shadows into thoughts
and causing every tree and rock to assume the semblance of a living form, but one which, while
shimmering and breathing, still sleeps in a dream - could not escape the Greeks, and they
expressed it as DIANA embracing Endymion.  But as night is the time sacred to secrecy, and as the
true Diana of the Mysteries was the Queen of Night, who wore the crescent moon, and mistress of
all hidden things, including "sweet secret sins and loved iniquities," there was attached to this myth
far more than meets the eye.  And just in the degree to which DIANA was believed to be Queen of
the emancipated witches and of Night, or the nocturnal Venus-Astarte herself, so far would the
love for sleeping Endymion be understood as sensual, yet sacred and allegorical.  And it is entirely
in this sense that the witches in Italy, who may claim with some right to be its true inheritors, have
preserved and understood the myth.<br>
     It is a realization of forbidden or secret love, with attraction to the dimly seen
beautiful-by-moonlight, with the fairy or witch-like charm of the supernatural - a romance
combined in a single strange form - the spell of Night!<br><br>
          "There is a dangerous silence in that hour <br>
          A stillness which leaves room for the full soul <br>
          To open all itself, without the power <br>
          Of calling wholly back its self-control;<br>
          The silver light which, hallowing tree and flower,<br>
          Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,<br>
          Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws <br>
          A loving languor which is not repose."<br>
     This is what is meant by the myth of DIANA and Endymion.  It is the making divine or
aesthetic (which to the Greeks was one and the same) that which is impassioned, secret, and
forbidden.  It was the charm of the stolen waters which are sweet, intensified to poetry.  And it is
remarkable that it has been so strangely preserved in Italian with traditions.<br><br><BR>

<center>CHAPTER X <br><br>MADONNA DIANA <br></center><br>
     Once there was, in the very old time in Cettardo Alto, a girl of astonishing beauty, and she
was betrothed to a young man who was as remarkable for good looks as herself; but though well
born and bred, the fortune or misfortunes of war or fate had made them both extremely poor. 
And if the young lady had one fault, it was her great pride, nor would she willingly be married
unless in good style, with luxury and festivity, in a fine garment, with many bridesmaids of
rank.<br>
     And this became to the beautiful Rorasa - for such was her name - such an object of
desire, that her head was half turned with it, and the other girls of her acquaintance, to say nothing
of the many men whom she had refused, mocked her so bitterly, asking her when the fine wedding
was to be, with many other jeers and sneers, that at last in a moment of madness she went to the
top of a high tower, whence she cast herself; and to make it worse, there was below a terrible
ravine into which she fell.<br>
     Yet she took no harm, for as she fell there appeared to her a very beautiful woman, truly
not of earth, who took her by the hand and bore her through the air to a safe place.<br>
     Then all the people round who saw or heard of this thing cried out, "Lo, a miracle!" and
they came and made a great festival, and would fain persuade Rorasa that she had been saved by
the Madonna.<br>
     But the lady who had saved her, coming to her secretly, said, "If thou hast any desire,
follow the Gospel of DIANA, or what is called the Gospel of the Witches, who worship the
moon."<br>
          "If thou adorest Luna, then
          What thou desir'st thou shalt obtain!"<br>
     Then the beautiful girl went forth alone by night to the fields, and kneeling on a stone in an
old ruin, she worshipped the moon and invoked DIANA thus:<br>
          Diana, beautiful Diana!<br>
          Thou who didst save from a dreadful death <br>
          When I did fall into the dark ravine!<br>
          I pray thee grant me still another grace.<br>
          Give me one glorious wedding, and with it <br>
          Full many bridesmaids, beautiful and grand;<br>
          And if this favour thou wilt grant me,<br>
          True to the Witches' Gospel I will be!<br><br>
     When Rorasa awoke in the morning, she found herself in another house, where all was far
more magnificent, and having risen, a beautiful maid led her into another room, where she was
dressed in a superb wedding garment of white silk with diamonds, for it was her wedding dress
indeed.  Then there appeared ten young ladies, all splendidly attired, and with them and many
distinguished persons she went to the church in a carriage.  And all the streets were filled with
music and people bearing flowers.<br>
     So she found the bridegrooms, and was wedded to her heart's desire, ten times more
grandly than she had ever dreamed of.  Then, after the ceremony, there was spread a feast at
which all the nobility of Cettardo were present, and, moreover, the whole town, rich and poor,
were feasted.<br>
     When the wedding was finished, the bridesmaids made every one a magnificent present to
the bride - one gave diamonds, another a parchment (written) in gold, after which they asked
permission to go all together into the sacristy.  And there they remained for some hours
undisturbed, until the priest sent his chierico to inquire whether they wanted anything.  But what
was the youth's amazement at beholding, not the ten bridesmaids, but their ten images or likenesses
in wood and in terra-cotta, with that of DIANA standing on a moon, and they were all so
magnificently made and adorned as to be of immense value.<br>
     Therefore the priest put these images in the church, which is the most ancient in Cettardo,
and now in many churches you may see the Madonna and Moon, but it is DIANA.  The name
Rorasa seems to indicate the Latin ros the dew, rorare, to bedew, rorulenta, bedewed - in fact, the
goddess of the dew.  Her great fall and being lifted by DIANA suggest the fall of dew by night, and
its rising in vapor under the influence of the moon.  It is possible that this is a very old Latin mythic
tale.  The white silk and diamonds indicate the dew.<br><br><BR>
<HR>
<center>CHAPTER XI <br><br>THE HOUSE OF THE WIND <br></center><br>
     The following story does not belong to the Gospel of Witches, but I add it as it confirms
the fact that the worship of DIANA existed for a long time contemporary with Christianity.  Its full
title in the original MS, which was written out by Maddalena, after hearing it from a man who was
a native of Volterra, is The Female  Pilgrim of the House of the Wind.  It may be added that, as
the tale declares, the house in question is still standing.<br><br>
     There is a peasants house at the beginning of the hill or ascent leading to Volterra, and it is
called the House of the Wind.  Near it there once stood a small palace, wherein dwelt a married
couple, who had but one child, a daughter, whom they adored.  Truly if the child had but a
headache, they each had a worse attack from fear.<br>
     Little by little as the girl grew older, and all the thought of the mother, who was very
devout, was that she should become a nun.  But the girl did not like this, and declared that she
hoped to be married like others.  And when looking from her window one day, she saw and heard
the birds singing in the vines and among the trees all so merrily, she said to her mother that she
hoped some day to have a family of little birds of her own, singing round her in a cheerful nest. 
At which the mother was so angry that she gave her daughter a cuff.  And the young lady wept,
but replied with spirit, that if beaten or treated in any such manner, that she would certainly soon
find some way to escape and get married, for she had no idea of being made a nun against her
will.<br> At hearing this the mother was seriously frightened, for she knew the spirit of her child,
and was afraid lest the girl already had a lover, and would make a great scandal over the blow; and
turning it all over, she thought of an elderly lady of good family, but much reduced, who was
famous for her intelligence, learning, and power of persuasion, and she thought, "This will be just
the person to induce my daughter to become pious, and fill her head with devotion and make a
nun of her."  So she sent for this clever person, who was at once appointed the governess and
constant attendant of the young lady, who, instead of quarreling with her guardian, became
devoted to her.<br> However, everything in this world does not go exactly as we would have it, and no one
knows what fish or crab may hide under a rock in a river.  For it so happened that the governess
was not a Catholic at all, as will presently appear, and did not vex her pupil with any threats of a
nun's life, nor even with an approval of it.<br> It came to pass that the young lady, who was in the habit of lying awake on moonlight nights to hear the nightingales sing, thought she heard her governess in the next room, of which the
door was open, rise and go forth on the great balcony.  The next night the same thing took place,
and rising very softly and unseen, she beheld the lady praying, or at least kneeling in the
moonlight, which seemed to her to be very singular conduct, the more so because the lady kneeling
uttered words which the younger could not understand, and which certainly formed no part of the
Church service.<br>
     And being much exercised over the strange occurrence, she at last, with timid excuses, told
her governess what she had seen.  Then the latter, after a little reflection, first binding her to a
secrecy of life and death, for, as she declared, it was a matter of great peril, spoke as follows:<br>
     "I, like thee, was instructed when young by priests to worship an invisible god.  But an old
woman in whom I had great confidence once said to me, 'Why worship a deity whom you cannot
see, when there is the Moon in all her splendor visible?  Worship her.  Invoke Diana, the goddess
of the Moon, and she will grant your prayers.'  This shalt thou do, obeying the Gospel of (the
Witches and of) Diana, who is Queen of the Fairies and of the Moon"<br>
     Now the young lady being persuaded, was converted to the worship of DIANA and the
Moon, and having prayed with all her heart for a lover (having learned the conjuration to the
goddess), was soon rewarded by the attention and devotion of a brave and wealthy cavalier, who
was indeed as admirable a suitor as any one could desire.  But the mother, who was far more bent
on gratifying vindictiveness and cruel vanity than on her daughter's happiness, was infuriated at
this, and when the gentleman came to her, she bade him begone, for her daughter was vowed to
become a nun, and a nun she should be or die.<br>
     Then the young lady was shut up in a cell in a tower, without even the company of her
governess, and put to strong and hard pain, being made to sleep on the stone floor, and would
have died of hunger had her mother had her way.<br>
     Then in this dire need she prayed to DIANA to set her free; when lo! she found the prison
door unfastened, and easily escaped.  Then having obtained a pilgrims dress, she traveled far and
wide, teaching and preaching the religion of old times, the religion of DIANA, the Queen of the
Fairies and of the Moon, the goddess of the poor and oppressed.<br>
     And the fame of  her wisdom and beauty went forth over all the land, and the people
worshipped her, calling her La Bella Pellegrina.  At last her mother, hearing of her, was in a
greater rage than ever, and, in fine, after much trouble, succeeded in having her arrested and cast
into prison.  And then in evil temper indeed she asked her whether she would become a nun; to
which she replied that it was not possible, because she had left the Catholic Church and become a
worshipper of DIANA and of the Moon.<br>
     And the end of it was that the mother, regarding her daughter as lost,  gave her up to the
priests to be put to torture and death, as they did all who would not agree with them or who left
their religion.<br>
     But the people were not well pleased with this, because they adored her beauty and
goodness, and there were few who had not enjoyed her charity.<br>
     But by the aid of her lover she obtained, as a last grace, that on the night before she was to
be tortured and executed she might, with a guard, go forth into the garden of the palace and pray.
     This she did, and standing by the door of the house, which is still there, prayed in the light
of the full moon to Diana, that she might be delivered from the dire persecution to which she had
been subjected, since even her own parents had willingly given her over to an awful death.<br>
     Now her parents and the priests, and all who sought her death, were in the palace watching
lest she should escape.<br>
     When lo! in answer to her prayer there came a terrible tempest and overwhelming wind, a
storm such as man had never seen before, which overthrew and swept away the palace with all
who were in it; there was not one stone left upon another, nor one soul alive of all who were there. 
The gods had replied to the prayer.<br>
     The young lady escaped happily with her lover, wedded him, and the house of the peasant
where the lady stood is still called the House of the Wind.<br><br>
     This is very accurately the story as I received it, but I freely admit that I have very much
condensed the language of the original text, which consists of  twenty pages, and which, as regards
needless padding, indicates a capacity on the part of the narrator to write an average modern
fashionable novel, even a second rate French one, which is saying a great deal.  It is true that there
are in it no detailed descriptions of scenery, skies, trees, or clouds - and a great deal might be made
of Volterra in that way - but it is prolonged in a manner which shows a gift for it.  However, the
narrative itself is strangely original and vigorous, for it is such a relic of pure classic heathenism,
and such a survival of faith in the old mythology, as all the reflected second hand Hellenism of the
Aesthetes cannot equal.  That a real worship of or belief in classic divinities should have survived
to the present day in the very land of Papacy itself, is a much more curious fact than if a living
mammoth had been discovered in some out of the way corner of the earth, because the former is a
human phenomenon.  I forsee that the day will come, and that perhaps not so very far distant,
when the world of scholars will be amazed to consider to what a late period an immense body of
antique tradition survived in Northern Italy, and how indifferent the learned were regarding it;
there having been in very truth only one man, and he a foreigner, who earnestly occupied himself
with collecting and preserving it.<br>
     It is very probably that there were as many touching episodes among the heathen martyrs
who were forced to give up their beloved deities, such as DIANA, Venus, the Graces, and others,
who were worshipped for beauty, as there were even among the Christians who were thrown to
the lions.  For the heathen loved their gods with a human personal sympathy, without mysticism or
fear, as if they had been blood relations; and there were many among them who really believed
that such was the case when some damsel who had made a faux pas got out of it by attributing it
all to some god, faun, or satyr; which is very touching.  There is a great deal to be said for as well
as against the idolaters or worshippers of dolls, as I heard a small girl define them.<br><br><BR>
<HR>
<center>CHAPTER XII <br><br>TANA THE MOON GODDESS <br></center><br>
     The following story, which appeared originally in the Legends of Florence, collected from
the people by me, does not properly belong to the Witch's Gospel, as it is not strictly in accordance
with it; and yet it could not well be omitted, since it is on the same subject.  In it DIANA appears
simply as the lunar goddess of chastity, therefor not as a witch.  It was given to me as Fana, but my
informant said that it might be Tana; she was not sure.  As Tana occurs in another tale, and as the
subject is certainly DIANA, there can hardly be a question of this.<br><br>
     Tana was a very beautiful girl, but extremely poor, and as modest and pure as she was
beautiful and humble.  She went from one contadino to another, or from farm to farm to work,
and thus led an honest life.<br>
     There was a young boor, a very ugly, bestial, and brutish fellow, who was after his fashion
raging with love for her, but she could not so much as bear to look at him, and repelled all his
advances.<br>
     But late one night, when she was returning alone from the farmhouse where she had
worked to her home, this man who had hidden himself in a thicket, leaped out on her and cried,
"Thou canst not flee; mine thou shalt be!"<br>
     And seeing no help near, and only the full moon looking down on her from heaven, Tana
in despair cast herself on her knees and cried to it:<br><br>
          "I have no one on earth to defend me,<br>
          Thou alone dost see me in this strait;<br>
          Therefore I pray to thee, O Moon!<br>
          As thou art beautiful so thou art bright <br>
          Flashing thy splendor over all mankind;<br>
          Even so I pray thee light up the mind <br>
          Of this poor ruffian, who would wrong me here,<br>
          Even to the worst.  Cast light into his soul,<br>
          That he may let me be in peace, and then <br>
          Return in all thy light unto my home!"<br><br>
     When she had said this, there appeared before her a bright but shadowy form, which said:<br><br>
          "Rise, and go to thy home!<br>
          Thou has well deserved this grace;<br>
          No one shall trouble thee more,<br>
          Purest of all on earth!<br>
          Thou shalt a goddess be,<br>
          The Goddess of the Moon,<br>
          Of all enchantment Queen!"<br>
<br>
     Thus it came to pass that Tana became the dea or spirit of the Moon.<br> <br>
     Though the air be set to a different key, this is a poem of pure melody, and the same as
Wordsworth's "Goody Blake and Harry Gill."  Both Tana and the old dame are surprised and
terrified; both pray to a power above:<br><br>
          "The cold, cold moon above her head,<br>
          Thus on her knees did Goody pray;<br>
          Young Harry heard what she had said,<br>
          And icy cold he turned away."<br><br>
     The dramatic center is just the same in both.  The English ballad soberly turns into an
incurable fir of ague inflicted on a greedy young boor; the Italian witch-poetess, with finer sense,
or with more sympathy for the heroine, casts the brute aside without further mention, and
apotheosizes the maiden, identifying her with the Moon.  The former is more practical and
probable, the latter more poetical.<br>
     And here it is worth while, despite digression, to remark what an immense majority there
are of people who can perceive, feel, and value poetry in mere words or form - that is to say,
objectively - and hardly know or note it when it is presented subjectively or as thought, but not put
into some kind of verse or measure, or regulated form.  This is a curious experiment and worth
studying.  Take a passage from some famous poet; write it out in pure simple prose, doing full
justice to its real meaning, and if it still actually thrills or moves as poetry, then it is of the first
class.  But if it has lost its glamour absolutely, it is second rate or inferior; for the best cannot be
made out of mere words varnished with associations, be they of thought or feeling.<br>
     This is not such a far cry from the subject as might be deemed.  Reading and feeling them
subjectively, I am often struck by the fact that in these Witch traditions which I have gathered there
is a wondrous poetry of thought, which far excels the efforts of many modern bards, and which
only requires the aid of some clever workman in words to assume the highest rank.  A proof of
what I have asserted may be found in the fact that, in such famous poems as the Finding of the
Lyre, by James Russell Lowell, and that on the invention of the pipe by Pan, by Mrs. Browning,
that which formed the most exquisite and refined portion of the original myths is omitted by both
authors, simply because they missed or did not perceive it.  For in the former we are not told that it
was the breathing of the god Air (who was the inspiring soul of ancient music, and the Bellaria of
modern witch-mythology) on the dried filament of the tortoise, which suggested to Hermes the
making an instrument wherewith he made the music of the spheres and guided the course of the
planets.  As for Mrs. Browning, she leaves out Syrinx altogether, that is to say, the voice of the
nymph still lingering in the pipe which had been her body.  Now to my mind the old prose
narrative of these myths is much more deeply poetical and moving, and far more inspired with
beauty and romance, than are the well-rhymed and measured, but very imperfect versions given by
our poets.  And in fact, such want of intelligence or perception may be found in all the 'classic'
poems, not only of Keats, but of almost every poet of the age who has dealt in Greek
subjects.<br>
          Great license is allowed to painters and poets, but when they take a subjective,
especially a deep tradition, and fail to perceive its real meaning or catch its point, and simply give
us something very pretty, but not so inspired with meaning as the original, it can hardly be claimed
that they have done their work as it might, or, in fact, should have been done.  I find that this fault
does not occur in the Italian or Tuscan witch versions of the ancient fables; on the contrary, they
keenly appreciate, and even expand, the antique spirit.  Hence I have often had occasion to remark
that it was not impossible that in some cases popular tradition, even as it now exists, has been
preserved more fully and accurately than we find it in any Latin writer.<br>
     Now apropos of missing the point, I would remind certain very literal readers that if they
find many faults of grammar, misspelling, and worse in the Italian texts in this book, they will not,
as a distinguished reviewer has done, attribute them all to the ignorance of the author, but to the
imperfect education of the person who collected and recorded them.  I am reminded of this by
having seen in a circulating library copy of my Legend of Florence, in which some good careful
soul had taken pains with a pencil to correct all the archaisms.  Wherein, he or she was like a
certain Boston proof reader, who in a book of mine changed the spelling of many citations from
Chaucer, Spenser, and others into the purest, or impurest, Webster; he being under the impression
that I was extremely ignorant of orthography.  As for the writing in or injuring books, which
always belong partly to posterity, it is a sin of vulgarity as well as morality, and indicates what
people are more than they dream.<br>

<center>CHAPTER XIII <br><br>DIANA AND THE CHILDREN <br></center>br>
     There was in Florence in the oldest time a noble family, but grown so poor that their feast
days were few and far between.  However, they dwelt in their old palace (which was in the street
now called La Via Cittadella), which was a fine old building, and so they kept up a brave show
before the world, when many a day they hardly had anything to eat.<br>
     Round this palace was a large garden, in which stood an ancient marble statue of Diana,
like a beautiful woman who seemed to be running with a dog by her side.  She held in her hand a
bow, and on her forehead was a small moon.  And it was said that by night, when all was still, the
statue became like life and fled, and did not return till the moon set or the sun rose.<br>
     The father of the family had two children, who were good and intelligent.  On day they
came home with many flowers that had been given to them, and the little girl said to the brother,
"The beautiful lady with the bow ought to have some of these!"<br>
     Saying this, they laid flowers before the statue and made a wreath, which the boy placed
on her head.<br>
     Just then the great poet and magician Virgil, who knew everything about the god and
fairies, entered the garden and said, smiling, "You have made the offering of flowers to the
goddess quite correctly, as they did of old; all that remains is to pronounce the prayer properly,
and it is this:"<br>
     So he repeated the invocation of Diana:<br><br>
          Lovely Goddess of the bow!<br>
          Lovely Goddess of the arrows!<br>
          Of all hounds and of all hunting <br>
          Thou who wakest in starry heaven <br>
          When the sun is sunk in slumber <br>
          Thou with moon upon thy forehead,<br>
          Who the chase by night preferrest <br>
          Unto hunting in the daylight,<br>
          With thy nymphs unto the music <br>
          Of the horn - thyself the huntress,<br>
          And most powerful:  I pray thee <br>
          Think, although but for an instant,<br>
          Upon us who pray unto thee!<br><br>
     Then Virgil taught them also the spell to be uttered when good fortune or aught is specially
required - <br><br>
          Fair goddess of the rainbow,<br>
          Of the stars and of the moon!<br>
          The queen most powerful <br>
          Of hunters and the night!<br>
          We beg of thee thy aid,<br>
          That thou may'st give to us <br>
          The best of fortune ever!<br>
          If thou heed'st our evocation <br>
          And wilt give good fortune to us,<br>
          Then in proof give us a token!<br><br>
     And having taught them this, Virgil departed.<br>
     Then the children ran to tell their parents all that had happened, and the latter impressed it
on them to keep it a secret, nor breathe a word or hint thereof to any one.  But what was their
amazement when they found early the next morning before the statue a deer freshly killed, which
gave them good dinners for many a day; nor did they want thereafter at any time game of all kinds,
when the prayer had been devoutly pronounced.<br>
     There was a neighbor of this family, a priest, who held in hate all the ways and worship of
the gods of the old time, and whatever did not belong to his religion, and he, passing the garden
one day, beheld the statue of DIANA crowned with roses and other flowers.  And being in a rage,
and seeing in the street a decayed cabbage, he rolled it in the mud, and threw it all dripping at the
face of the goddess, saying, "Behold, thou vile beast of idolatry, this is the worship which thou has
from me, and the devil do the rest for thee!"<br>
     Then the priest heard a voice in the gloom where the leaves were dense, and it said, "It is
well!  I give thee warning, since thou hast made thy offering, some of the game to thee I'll bring;
thou'lt have thy share in the morning."<br>
     All that night the priest suffered from horrible dreams and dread, and when at last, just
before three o'clock, he fell asleep, he suddenly awoke from a nightmare in which it seemed as if
something heavy rested on his chest.  And something indeed fell from him and rolled on the floor. 
And when he rose and picked it up, and looked at it by the light of the moon, he saw that it was a
human head, half decayed.<br>
     Another priest, who had heard his cry of terror, entered his room, and having looked at the
head, said, "I know that face!  It is of a man whom I confessed, and who was beheaded three
months ago at Siena."<br>
     And three days after, the priest who had insulted the goddess died.<br><br>
     The foregoing tale was not given to me as belonging to the Gospel of Witches, but as one
of a very large series of traditions relating to Virgil as a magician.  But it has its proper place in this
book, because it contains the invocation to and incantation of DIANA, these being remarkably
beautiful and original.  When we remember how these 'hymns' have been handed down or
preserved by old women, and doubtless much garbled, changed, and deformed by transmission, it
cannot but seem wonderful that so much classic beauty still remains in them, as, for instance, in
-<br><br>
          Lovely Goddess of the bow!<br>
          Lovely Goddess of the arrows!<br>
          Thou who walk'st I starry heaven!<br>
     Robert Browning was a great poet, but if we compare all the Italian witch poems of and to
DIANA with the former's much admired speech of Diana-Artemis, it will certainly be admitted by
impartial critics that the spells are fully equal to the following by the bard -<br><br>
          I am a goddess of the ambrosial courts,<br>
          And save by Here, Queen of Pride, surpassed <br>
          By none whose temples whiten this the world;<br>
          Through heaven I roll my lucid moon along,<br>
          I shed in Hell o'er my pale people peace,<br>
          On Earth, I, caring for the creatures, guard <br>
          Each pregnant yellow wolf and fox bitch sleek,<br>
          And every feathered mother's callow brood,<br>
          And all that love green haunts and loneliness.<br><br>
     This is pretty, but it is only imitation, and neither in form or spirit really equal to the
incantations, which are sincere on faith.  And it may here be observed in sorrow, yet in very truth,
that in a very great number of modern poetical handlings of classic mythic subjects, the writers
have, despite all their genius as artists, produced rococo work which will appear to be such to
another generation, simply from their having missed the point, or omitted from ignorance
something vital which the folk lorist would probably not have lost.  Achilles may be admirably
drawn, as I have seen him, in a Louis XIV. wig with a Turkish scimitar, but still one could wish
that the designer had been a little more familiar with Greek garments and weapons.<br><br><BR>
<HR>
<center>CHAPTER XIV <br><br>
THE GOBLIN MESSENGERS OF DIANA AND MERCURY <br></center><br>
     The following tale was not given to me as connected with the Gospel of the Witches, but as
DIANA appears in it, and as the whole conception is that of Diana and Apollo in another form, I
include it in the series.<br><br>
     Many centuries ago there was a goblin, or spirit or devil-angel, and Mercury, who was the
god of speed and of quickness, being much pleased with this imp, bestowed on him the gift of
running like the wind, with the privilege that whatever he pursued, be it spirit, a human being, or
animal, he should certainly overtake or catch it.<br>
     This goblin had a beautiful sister, who like him, ran errands, not for the gods, but for the
goddesses (there was a female god for every male, even down to the small spirits); and Diana on
the same day gave to this fairy the power that, whoever might chase her, she should, if pursued,
never be overtaken.<br>
     On day the brother saw his sister speeding like a flash of lightning across the heaven, and
he felt a sudden strange desire in rivalry to overtake her.  So he dashed after as she flitted on; but
though it was his destiny to catch, she had been fated never to be caught, and so the will of one
supreme god was balanced by that of another.<br>
     So the two kept flying round and round the edge of heaven, and at first all the gods roared
with laughter, but when they understood the case, hey grew serious, and asked one another how it
was to end.<br>
     Then the great father-god said, "Behold the earth, which is in darkness and gloom!  I will
change the sister into a Moon, and her brother into a sun.  And so shall she ever escape him, yet
will he ever catch her with his light, which shall fall on her from afar; for the rays of the sun are
his hands, which reach forth with burning grasp, yet which are ever eluded."<br>
     And thus it is said that this race begins anew with, the first of every month, when the moon
being cold, is covered with as many coats as an onion.  But while the race is being run, as the
moon becomes warm she casts off one garment after another, till she is naked and then stops, and
then when dressed the race begins again.<br><br>
     As the vast storm cloud falls in glittering drops, even so the great myths of the olden time
are broken up into small fairy tales, and as these drops in turn reunite.<br>
     "On silent lake or streamlet lone" as Villon hath it, even so minor myths are again formed
from the fallen waters.  In this story we clearly have the dog made by Vulcan and the wolf -
Jupiter settled the question by petrifying them - as you may read in Julius Pollux his fifth book, or
any other on mythology.<br>
          "Which hunting hound, as well is known,<br>
          Was changed by Jupiter to stone."<br>
     It is remarkable that in this story the moon is compared to an onion.  "The onion," says
Friedrich, "was, on account of its many skins, among the Egyptians the emblem and hieroglyph of
the many formed moon, whose different phases are so clearly seen I the root when it is cut
through, also because its growth or decrease corresponds with that of  the planet.  Therefore it was
dedicated to Isis, the Moon Goddess."  And for this reason the onion was so holy as to be regarded
as having in itself something of deity; for which reason Juvenal remarks that the Egyptians were
happy people to have gods growing in their gardens.    <br><br><BR>
<HR>
<center>CHAPTER XV <br><br>LAVERNA <br><br></center>
     The following very curious tale, with the incantation, was not in the text of the Vangelo,
but it very evidently belongs to the cycle or series of legends connected with it.  Diana is declared
to be the protectress of all outcasts, those to whom the night is their day, consequently of thieves;
and Laverna, as we may learn from Horace and Plautus, was pre-eminently the patroness of
pilfering and all rascality.  In this story she also appears as a witch and humorist.<br>
     It was given to me as a tradition of Virgil, who often appears as one familiar with the
marvelous and hidden lore of the olden time.<br><br>
     It happened on a time that Virgil, who knew all things hidden or magical, he who was a
magician and poet, having heard a speech (or oration) by a famous talker who had not much in
him, was asked what he thought of it.  And he replied, "It seems to me to be impossible to tell
whether it was all introduction or all conclusion; certainly there was no body in it.  It was like
certain fish of whom one is in doubt whether they are all head or all tail, or only head and tail; or
the goddess Laverna, of whom no one ever know whether she was all head or all body, or neither
or both."<br>
     Then the emperor inquired who this deity might be, for he had never heard of her.<br>
     And Virgil replied, "Among the gods or spirits who were of ancient times - may they be
ever favorable to us!  Among them (was) one female who was the craftiest and most knavish of
them all.  She was called Laverna.  She was a thief, and very little known to the other deities, who
were honest and dignified, for she was rarely in heaven or in the country of the fairies.<br>
     "She was almost always on earth, among thieves, pickpockets, and panders - she lived in
darkness.<br>
     "Once it happened that she went (to a mortal), a great priest in the form and guise of a very
beautiful stately priestess (of some goddess), and said to him: - <br>
     " ' You have an estate which I wish to buy.  I intend to build on it a temple to (our) God.  I
swear to you on my body that I will pay thee within a year'<br>
     "Therefore the priest transferred to her the estate.<br>
     "And very soon Laverna had sold off all the crops, grain, cattle, wood, and poultry.  There
was not left the value of four farthings.<br>
     "But on the day fixed for payment there was no Laverna to be seen.  The fair goddess was
far away, and had left her creditor in the lurch!<br>
     "At the same time Laverna went to a great lord and bought of him a castle, well furnished
within and broad rich lands without.<br>
     "But this time she swore on her head to pay in full in six months.<br>
     "And as she had done by the priest, so she acted to the lord of the castle, and stole and sold
every stick, furniture, cattle, men, and mice - there was not left wherewith to feed a fly.<br>
     "Then the priest and the lord, finding out who this was, appealed to the gods, complaining
that they had been robbed by a goddess.<br>
     "And it was soon made known to them all that this was Laverna.<br>
     "Therefore she was called to judgment before all the gods.<br>
     "And when she was asked what she had done with the property of the priest, unto whom
she had sworn by her body to make payment at the time appointed (and why she had broken her
oath)?<br>
     "She replied by a strange deed which amazed them all, for she made her body disappear,
so that only her head remained visible, and it cried: -<br>
     " "Behold me!  I swore by my body, but body have I none!'<br>
     "Then all the gods laughed.<br>
     "After the priest came the lord who had also been tricked, and to whom she had sworn by
her head.  And in reply to him Laverna showed all present her whole body without mincing
matters, and it was one of extreme beauty, but without a head; and from the neck thereof came a
voice which said: -<br>
          'Behold me, for I am Laverna, who <br>
          Have come to answer to that lord's complaint,<br>
          Who swears that I contracted debt to him,<br>
          And have not paid although the time is o'er <br>
          And that I am a thief because I swore <br>
          Upon my head - but, as you all can see,<br>
          I have no head at all, and therefore I <br>
          Assuredly ne'er swore by such an oath.'<br>
     "Then there was indeed a storm of laughter among the gods, who made the matter right by
ordering the head to join the body, and bidding Laverna pay up her debts, which she did.<br>
     "Then Jove spoke and said: -<br>
     " 'Here is a roguish goddess without a duty (or a worshipper), while there are in Rome
innumerable thieves, sharpers, cheats, and rascals who live by deceit.<br>
     " "These good folk have neither a church nor a god, and it is a great pity, for even the very
devils have their master, Satan, as the head of the family.  Therefore, I command that in future
Laverna shall be the goddess of all the knaves or dishonest tradesman, with the whole rubbish and
refuse of the human race, who have been hitherto without a god or a devil, inasmuch as they have
been too despicable for the one or the other.'<br>
     "And so Laverna became the goddess of all dishonest and shabby people.<br>
     "Whenever any one planned or intended any knavery or aught wicked, he entered her
temple, and invoked Laverna, who appeared to him as a woman's head.  But if he did his work of
knavery badly or maladroitly, when he again invoked her he saw only the body; but if he was
clever, then he beheld the whole goddess, head and body.<br>
     "Laverna was no more chaste than she was honest, and had many lovers and many
children.  It was said that not being bad at heart or cruel, she often repented her life and sins; but
do what she might, she could not reform, because her passions were so inveterate.<br>
     "And if a man had got any woman with child or any maid found herself enceinte, and
would hide it from the world and escape scandal, they would go every day to invoke Laverna.<br>
     "Then when the time came for the suppliant to be delivered, Laverna would bear her in
sleep during the night to her temple, and after the birth cast her into slumber again, and bear her
back to her bed at home.  And when she woke in the morning, she was ever in vigorous health and
felt no weariness, and all seemed to her as a dream.<br>
     "But to those who desired in time to reclaim their children, Laverna was indulgent if they
led such lives as pleased her and faithfully worshipped her.<br>
     "And this is the ceremony to be performed and the incantation to be offered every night to
Laverna.<br>
     "There must be a set place devoted to the goddess, be it a room, a cellar, or a grove, but
ever a solitary place.<br>
     "Then take a small table of the size of forty playing cards set close together, and this must
be hid in the same place, and going there at night...<br>
     "Take forty cards and spread them on the table, making of them a close carpet or cover on
it.<br>
     "Take of the herbs paura and concordia, and boil the two together, repeating meanwhile
the following: -<br><br>
          I boil the cluster of concordia <br>
          To keep in concord and at peace with me <br>
          Laverna, that she may restore to me <br>
          My child, and that she by her favoring care <br>
          May guard me well from danger all my life!<br>
          I boil this herb, yet 'tis not it which boils,<br>
          I boil the fear, that it may keep afar <br>
          Any intruder, and if such should come <br>
          (to spy upon my rite), may he be struck <br>
          With fear and in his terror haste away!<br><br>
     Having said thus, put the boiled herbs in a bottle and spread the cards on the table  one by
one, saying: -<br><br>
          I spread before me now the forty cards <br>
          Yet 'tis not forty cards which here I spread,<br>
          But forty of the gods superior <br>
          To the deity Laverna, that their forms <br>
          May each and all become volcanoes hot,<br>
          Until Laverna comes and brings my child;<br>
          And 'till 'tis done may they all cast at her <br>
          Hot flames of fire, and with them glowing coals <br>
          From noses, mouths, and ears (until she yields);<br>
          Then may they leave Laverna at her peace,<br>
          Free to embrace her children at her will!<br><br>
     "Laverna was the Roman goddess of thieves, pickpockets, shopkeepers or dealers,
plagiarists, rascals, and hypocrites.  There was near Rome a temple in a grove where robbers went
to divide their plunder.  There was a statue of the goddess.  Her image, according to some, was a
head without a body; according to others, a body without a head; but the epithet of 'beautiful'
applied to her by Horace indicates that she who gave disguises to her worshippers had kept one to
herself."  She was worshipped in perfect silence.  This is confirmed by a passage to Horace, where
an impostor, hardly daring to move his lips, repeats the following prayer or incantation: - <br><br>
          "O goddess Laverna!<br>
          Give me the art of cheating and deceiving,<br>
          Of making men believe that I am just,<br>
          Holy, and innocent! extend all darkness <br>
          And deep obscurity o'er my misdeeds!"<br><br>
     It is interesting to compare this unquestionably ancient classic invocation to Laverna with
the one which is before given.  The goddess was extensively known to the lower orders, and in
Plautus a cook who has been robbed of his implements calls on her to revenge him.<br>
     I call special attention to the fact that in this, as in a great number of Italian witch
incantations, the deity or spirit who is worshipped, be it Diana herself or Laverna, is threatened
with torment by a higher power until he or she grants the favour demanded.  This is quite classic
(Grecco-Roman or Oriental) in all of which sources the magician relies not on favour, aid, or
power granted by either God or Satan, but simply on what he has been able to wrench and wring,
as it were, out of infinite nature or the primal source by penance and study.  I mention this because
a reviewer has reproached me with exaggerating the degree to which diabolism - introduced by the
Church since 1500 - is deficient in Italy.  But in fact, among the higher classes of witches, or in
their traditions, it is hardly to be found at all.  In Christian diabolism the witch never dares to
threaten Satan or God, or any of the Trinity or angels, for the whole system is based on the
conception of a Church and of obedience.<br>
     The herb concordia probably takes its name from that of the goddess Concordia, who was
represented as holding a branch.  It plays a great part in witchcraft, after verbena and rue.<br><br>
APPENDIX <br><br>
     So long ago as the year 1886 I learned that there was in existence a manuscript setting forth
the doctrines of Italian witchcraft, and I was promised that, if possible, it should be obtained for
me.  In this I was for a time disappointed.  But having urged it on Maddalena, my collector of folk
lore, while she was leading a wandering life in Tuscany, to make an effort to obtain or recover
something of the kind, I at last received from her, on January 1, 1897, from Colle, Val d'Elsa, near
Siena, the MS entitled Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches.<br>
     Now be it observed, that every leading point which forms the plot or center of this Vangel,
such as that Diana is Queen of the Witches; an associate of Herodius (Aradia) in her relations to
sorcery; that she bore a child to her brother the Sun (here Lucifer); that as a moon-goddess she is
in some relation to Cain, who dwells as prisoner in the moon, and that the witches of old were
people oppressed by feudal lands, the former revenging themselves in every way, and holding
orgies to Diana which the Church represented as being the worship of Satan - all of this, I repeat,
had been told or written out for me in fragments by Maddalena (not to speak of other authorities),
even as it had been chronicled by Horst or Michelet; therefore all this is in the present document of
minor importance.  All of this I expected, but what I did not expect, and what was new to me, was
that portion which is given as prose-poetry and which I have rendered in meter or verse.  This
being traditional, and taken down from wizards, is extremely curious and interesting, since in it are
preserved many relics of lore which, as may be verified from records, have come down from days
of yore.<br>
     Aradia is evidently enough Herodius, who was regarded in the beginning as associated with
Diana as chief of the witches.  This was not, as I opined, derived from the Herodias of the New
Testament, but from an earlier replica of Lilith, bearing the same name.  It is, in fact an
identification or twin-ing of the Aryan and Shemitic Queens of Heaven, or of Night and of
Sorcery, and it may be that this was known to the earliest myth makers.  So far back as the sixth
century the worship of Herodias and Diana by witches was condemned by a Church Council at
Ancyra.  Pipernus and other writers have noted the evident identity of Herodias with Lilith.  Isis
preceded both.<br>
     Diana is very vigorously, even dramatically, set forth in this poem as the goddess of the
god forsaken and ungodly, of thieves, harlots, and, truthfully enough, of the 'minions of the moon,'
as Falstaff would have fain had them called.  It was recognized in ancient Rome, as it is in modern
India, that no human being can be so bad or vile as to have forfeited all right to divine protection
of some kind or other, and Diana was this protectress.  It my be as well to observe here, that
among all free thinking philosophers, educated parias, and literary or book bohemians, there has
ever been a most unorthodox tendency to believe that the faults and errors of humanity are more
due (if not altogether due) to unavoidable causes which we cannot help, as, for instance, heredity,
the being born savages, or poor, or in vice, or unto 'bigotry and virtue' in excess, or unto
inquisitioning - that is to say, when we are so over burdened with innately born sin that all our free
will cannot set us free from it.<br>
     It was during the so called Dark Ages, or from the downfall of the Roman Empire until the
thirteenth century, that the belief that all which was worst in man owed its origin solely to the
monstrous abuses and tyranny of Church and State.  For then, at every turn in life, the vast
majority encountered downright shameless, palpable iniquity and injustice, with no law for the
weak who were without patrons.<br>
     The perception of this drove vast numbers of the discontented into rebellion, and as they
could not prevail by open warfare, they took their hatred out in a form of secret anarchy, which
was, however, intimately blended with superstition and fragments of old tradition.  Prominent in
this, and naturally enough, was the worship of Diana the protectress, for the alleged adoration of
Satan was a far later invention of the Church, and it has never really found a leading place in
Italian witchcraft to this day.  That is to say, purely diabolical witchcraft did not find general
acceptance till the end of the fifteenth century, when it was, one may almost say, invented in Rome
to supply means wherewith to destroy the threatening heresy of Germany.<br>
     The growth of Sentiment is the increase of suffering; man is never entirely miserable until
he finds out how wronged he is and fancies that he sees far ahead a possible freedom.  In ancient
times men as slaves suffered less under even more abuse, because they believed they were born to
low conditions of life.  Even the best reform brings pain with it, and the great awakening of man
was accompanied with griefs, many of which even yet endure.  Pessimism is the result of too much
culture and introversion.<br>
     It appears to be strangely out of sight and out of mind with all historians, that the sufferings
of the vast majority of mankind, or the enslaved and poor, were far greater under early
Christianity, or till the end of the Middle Ages and the Emancipation of Serfs, than they were
before.  The reason for this was that in the old 'heathen' time the humble did not know, or even
dream, that all are equal before God, or that they had many rights, even here on earth, as slaves;
for, in fact, the whole moral tendency of the New Testament is utterly opposed to slavery, or even
sever servitude.  Every word uttered teaching Christ's mercy and love, humility and charity, was, in
fact, a bitter reproof, not only to every lord in the land, but to the Church itself, and its arrogant
prelates.  The fact that many abuses had been mitigated and that there were benevolent saints, does
not affect the fact that, on the whole, mankind was for a long time worse off than before, and the
greatest cause of this suffering was what may be called a sentimental one, or a newly born
consciousness of rights withheld, which is always of itself a torture.  And this was greatly
aggravated by the endless preaching to the people that it was a duty to suffer and endure
oppression and tyranny, and that the rights of Authority of all kinds were so great that they on the
whole even excused their worst abuses.  For by upholding Authority in the nobility the Church
maintained its own.<br>
     The result of it all was a vast development of rebels, outcasts, and all the discontented, who
adopted witchcraft or sorcery for a religion, and wizards as their  priests.  They had secret
meetings in desert places, among old ruins accursed by priests as the haunt of evil spirits or ancient
heathen gods, or in the mountains.  To this day the dweller in Italy may often find secluded spots
environed by ancient chestnut forests, rocks, and walls, which suggest fit places for the Sabbat,
and are sometimes still believed by tradition to be such.  And I also believe that in this Gospel of
the Witches we have a trustworthy outline at least of the doctrine and rites observed at these
meetings.  They adored forbidden deities and practiced forbidden deeds, inspired as much by
rebellion against Society as their own passions.<br>
     There is, however, in the Evangel of the Witches an effort made to distinguish between the
naturally wicked or corrupt and those who are outcasts or oppressed, as appears from the
passage:<br>
- <br><br>
          "Yet like Cain's daughter (offspring) thou shalt never be,<br>
          Nor like the race who have become at last <br>
          Wicked and infamous from suffering,<br>
          As are the Jews and wandering Zingari,<br>
          Who are all thieves: like then ye shall not be."<br><br>
     The supper of the Witches, the cakes of meal, salt, and honey, in the form of crescent
moons, are known to every classical scholar.  The moon or horn shaped cakes are still common.  I
have eaten of them this very day, and though they are known all over the world, I believe they owe
their fashion to tradition.<br>
     In the conjuration of the meal there is a very curious tradition introduced to the effect that
the glittering grains of wheat from which spikes shoot like sun rays, owe their brilliant likeness to a
resemblance to the firefly, 'who comes to give the light.'  We have, I doubt not, in this a classic
tradition, but I cannot verify it.  Hereupon the Vangelo cites a common nursery rhyme, which may
also be found a nursery tale, yet which, like others, is derived from witch lore, by which the
lucciola is put under a glass and conjured to give by its light certain answers.<br>
     The conjuration of the meal or bread, as being literally our body as contributing to form it,
and deeply sacred because it had lain in the earth, where dark and wondrous secrets bide, seems to
cast a new light on the Christian sacrament.  It is a type of resurrection from earth, and was
therefore used at the Mysteries and Holy Supper, and the grain had pertained to chthonic secrets,
or to what had been under the earth in darkness.  Thus even earthworms are invoked in modern
witchcraft as familiar with dark mysteries, and the shepherd's pipe to win the Orphic power must
be buried three days in the earth.  And so all was, and is, in sorcery a kind of wild poetry based on
symbols, all blending into one another, light and darkness, fireflies and grain, life and death.<br>
     Very strange indeed, but very strictly according to ancient magic as described by classic
authorities, is the threatening Diana, in case she will not grant a prayer.  This recurs continually in
the witch exorcisms or spells.  The magus, or witch, worships the spirit, but claims to have the
right, drawn from a higher power, to compel even the Queen of Earth, Heaven and Hell to grant
the request.  "Give what I ask, and thou shalt have honor and offerings; refuse, and I will vex thee
by insult."  So Canidia and her kind boasted that they could compel the gods to appear.  This is all
classic.  No one ever heard of a Satanic witch invoking or threatening the Trinity, or Christ or even
the angels or saints.  In fact, they cannot even compel the devil or his imps to obey - they work
entirely by his good will as slaves.  But in the old Italian lore the sorcerer or witch is all or nothing,
and aims at limitless will or power.<br>
     Of the ancient belief in the virtues of a perforated stone I need not speak.  But it is to be
remarked that in the invocation the witch goes forth in the earliest morning to seek for verbena or
verbain.  The ancient Persian magi, or rather their daughters, worshipped the sun as it rose by
waving freshly plucked verbena, which was one of the seven most powerful plants in magic. 
These Persian priestesses were naked while they thus worshipped, nudity being a symbol of truth
and sincerity.<br>
     The extinguishing the lights, nakedness, and the orgy, were regarded as symbolical of the
body being laid in the ground, the grain being planted, or of entering into darkness and death, to be
revived in new forms, or regeneration and light.  It was the laying aside of daily life.<br>
     The Gospel of the Witches, as I have given it, is in reality only the initial chapter of the
collection of ceremonies, incantations, and traditions current in the fraternity or sisterhood, the
whole of which are in the main to be found in my Etruscan Roman Remains and Florentine
Legends.  I have, it is true, a great number as yet unpublished, and there are more ungathered, but
the whole scripture of this sorcery, all its principal tenets, formulas, medicaments, and mysteries
may be found in what I have collected and printed.  Yet I would urge that it would be worth while
to arrange and edit it all into one work, because it would be to every student of archeology, folk
lore, or history of great value.  It has been the faith of millions in the past it has made itself felt in
innumerable traditions, which deserve to be better understood than they are, and I would gladly
undertake the work if I believed that the public would make it worth the publisher's outlay and
pains.<br>
     It may be observed with truth that I have not treated this Gospel, nor even the subject of
witchcraft, entirely as folk lore, as the word is strictly defined and carried out; that is, as a mere
traditional fact or thing to be chiefly regarded as a variant like or unlike sundry other traditions, or
to be tabulated and put away in pigeon holes for reference.  That it is useful and sensible to do all
this is perfectly true, and it has led to an immense amount of valuable search, collection, and
preservation.  But there is this to be said, and I have observed that here and there a few genial
minds are beginning to awake to it, that the mere study of the letter in this way has developed a
great indifference to the spirit, going in may cases so far as to produce, like Realism in Art (to
which it is allied), even a contempt for the matter or meaning of it, as originally believed in.<br>
     I was lately much struck by the fact that in a very learned work on Music, the author, in
discussing that of ancient times and of the East, while extremely accurate and minute in
determining pentatonic and all other scales, and what may be called the mere machinery and
history of composition, showed that he was utterly ignorant of the fundamental fact that notes and
chords, bars and melodies, were in themselves ideas or thoughts.  Thus Confucius is said to have
composed a melody which was a personal description of himself.  Now if this be not understood,
we cannot understand the soul of early music, and the folk lorist who cannot get beyond the letter
and fancies himself 'scientific' is exactly like the musician who has no idea of how or why melodies
were anciently composed.<br>
     The strange and mystical chapter 'How Diana made the Stars and the Rain' is the same
given in my Legends of Florence, but much enlarged, or developed to a cosmogonic-mythologic
sketch.  And here a reflection occurs which is perhaps the most remarkable which all this Witch
Evangel suggests.  In all other Scriptures of all races, it is the male, Jehovah, Buddha or Brahma,
who creates the universe; in Witch Sorcery it is the female who is the primitive principle. 
Whenever in history there is a period of radical intellectual rebellion against long established
conservatism, hierarchy, and the like, there is always an effort to regard Woman as the fully equal,
which means the superior sex.  Thus in the extraordinary war of conflicting elements, strange
schools of sorcery, Neo-Platonism, Cabala, Hermetic Christianity, Gnosticism, Persian Magism
and Dualism, with the remains of old Greek and Egyptian theologies in the third and fourth
centuries at Alexandria, and in the House of Light of Cairo in the ninth, the equality of Woman
was a prominent doctrine.  It was Sophia or Helena, the enfranchised, who was then the true
Christ who was to save mankind.<br>
     When Illumination, in company with magic and mysticism, and a resolve to regenerate
society according to extreme free thought, inspired the Templars to the hope that they would
master the Church and the world, the equality of Woman derived from the Cairene traditions,
again received attention.  And it may be observed that during the Middle Ages, and even so late as
the intense excitements which inspired the French Huguenots, the Jansenists and the Anabaptists,
Woman always came forth more prominently or played a far greater part than she had done in
social or political life.  This was also the case in the Spiritualism founded by the Fox sisters of
Rochester, New York, and it is manifesting itself in many ways in the Fin de Siecle, which is also a
nervous chaos according to Nordau - Woman being evidently a fish who shows herself most when
the waters are troubled.<br>
     But we should also remember that in the earlier ages the vast majority of mankind itself,
suppressed by the too great or greatly abused power of Church and State, only manifested itself at
such periods of rebellion against forms or ideas grown old.  And with every new rebellion, every
fresh outburst or wild inundation and bursting over the barriers, humanity and woman gain
something, that is to say, their just dues or rights.  For as every freshet spreads more widely its
waters over the fields, which are in due time the more fertilized thereby, so the world at large gains
by every revolution, however terrible or repugnant it may be for a time.<br>
     The Emancipated or Woman's Rights woman, when too enthusiastic, generally considers
man as limited, while Woman is destined to gain on him.  In earlier ages a contrary opinion
prevailed, and both are, or were, apparently in the wrong, so far as the future is concerned.  For in
truth both sexes are progressive, and progress in this respect means not a conflict of the male and
female principle, such as formed the basis of the Mahabarata, but a gradual ascertaining of true
ability and adjustment of relations or coordination of powers.<br>
     These remarks are appropriate to my text and subject, because it is in studying the epochs
when woman has made herself prominent and influential that we learn what the capacities of the
female sex truly are.  Among these, that of witchcraft as it truly was - not as it is generally quite
misunderstood - is a deeply interesting as any other.  For the witch, laying aside all question as to
magic or its non-existence - was once a real factor or great power in rebellious social life, and to
this very day it is recognized that there is something uncanny, mysterious, and incomprehensible in
woman, which neither she herself nor man can explain.<br><br><BR>

<center>THE CHILDREN OF DIANA, OR HOW THE FAIRIES WERE BORN <br></center><br>
     All things were made by DIANA, the great spirits of the stars, men in their time and place,
the giants which were of old, and the dwarfs who dwell in the rocks, and once a month worship
her with cakes.<br>
     There was once a young man who was poor, without parents, yet he was good.<br>
     One night he sat in a lonely place, yet it was very beautiful, and there he saw a thousand
little fairies, shining white, dancing in the light of the full moon.<br>
     "Gladly would I be like you, O fairies!" said the youth, "free from care, needing no food. 
But what are ye?"<br>
     "We  are moon rays, the children of DIANA," replied one - <br>        
          We are children of the Moon.<br>
          We are born of shining light;<br>
          When the Moon shoots forth a ray,<br>
          Then it takes a fairy's form.<br>    
       "And thou art one of us because thou wert born when the Moon, our mother Diana, was
full; yes, our brother, kin to us, belonging to our band.<br>
     "And if thou art hungry and poor...and wilt have money in thy pocket, then think upon the
Moon, on Diana, unto whom thou wert born; then repeat these words - <br>
          "'Moon, Moon, beautiful Moon!<br>
          Fairer far than any star;<br>
          Moon, O Moon, if it may be,<br>
          Bring good fortune unto me!'<br>
     "And then, if thou has money in thy pocket, thou wilt have it doubled.<br>
     "For the children who are born in a full moon are sons or daughters of the Moon,<br>
          'Good evening, fair goat!<br>
          And he will reply,<br>
          'Good evening, fair sir!<br>
          I am so weary <br>
          That I can go no farther <br>
          And thou shalt reply as usual,<br>
          'Fairy Diana, I conjure thee <br>
          To give to this goat relief and peace!'<br>
     "Then will we enter in a great hall where thou wilt see many beautiful ladies who will try to
fascinate thee; but let thy answer ever be, 'She whom I love is her of Monteroni.'<br>
     "And now Gianni, to horse; mount and away!"  So he mounted the cat, which flew as
quick as thought, and found the mare, and having pronounced over it the incantation, it became a
woman and said - <br>
          In the name of the Fairy Diana!<br>
          Mayest thou hereby become <br>
          A beautiful young man,<br>
          Red and white in hue,<br>
          Like to milk and blood!<br>
     After this he found the goat and conjured it in like manner, and it replied - <br>
          In the name of the Fairy Diana!<br>
          Be thou attired more richly than a prince!<br>
     So he passed to the hall, where he was wooed by beautiful ladies, but his answer to them
all was that his love was at Monterone.<br>
     Then he saw or knew no more, but on awakening found himself in Monterone, and so
changed to a handsome youth that no one knew him.  So he married his beautiful lady, and all
lived the hidden life of witches and wizards from that day, and are now in fairy land.<br></b></center><br><BR>
