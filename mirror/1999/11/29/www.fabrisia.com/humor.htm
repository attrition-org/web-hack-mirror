Nothing on this page is meant to offend anyone. Here is some 'mostly pagan' humor. I find these jokes to be funny and entertaining and not really in bad taste. I will remove some that many people find overly offensive and add some that you have and I don't.  Not all of these are 'pagan' humor. Please email me with your comments or additions.

<br><br>
*How many years does it take for a solitary witch to change a light bulb? How long does it take to get one out of the closet? 
<br><br>
*-The Mighty God Thor was riding across the skies on his fiery steed Pegasus. He raised his hammer and bellowed, "I'M THOR! I'M THOR!" Pegasus looked up at him and muttered, "You thoulda wore your thaddle, thilly." 
<br><br>
*How many Native Americans does it take to change a light bulb? Four---one to do the work and three to sing the Light Bulb Changing Song.

* What's the difference between a northern fairytale and

A northern fairytale begins "Once upon a time..."<br>
     
A southern fairytale begins "'Y'all ain't gonna 
believe this sh!^..."<br><br><br>

<center>WICCAN WONDERLAND<br>
by Stephanie Barclay, Storm Bear & Jimmy Williams
<br><br>
Tarot cards are you listening<br>
Crystal balls are you glistening<br>
The quarters are charged, we're wizards at large<br>
We're walking in a Wiccan Wonderland<br>
<br><br>
In the meadow we will cast a circle<br>
And pretend that it's a geosphere<br>
We'll have lots of fun upon the altar<br>
Until an evil spirit chances near<br>
<br><br>
Later on we'll perspire<br>
And get drunk by the fire<br>
We'll dance without clothes 'cause nobody knows<br>
We're walking in a Wiccan Wonderland<br>
<br><br>
All you Pagans come on gather round us<br>
Raise your chalice and join in our cheer<br>
We'll have lots of cakes until the Sun comes<br>
And chase it with another keg of beer. <br>                          
<br><br>
After all is said and done<br>
Bye to Spirits that have come<br>
Please stay if you will or go if you must<br>
We're walking in a Wiccan Wonderland<br></center>
<br><br><br>
WHY M&M'S ARE WICCAN:
<br><br>
*  MM = Merry Meet<br>
*  Round shape for wheel of the year, cycle of seasons<br>
* Skins are different colors, but the inside is the same chocolate, 
because we are all related<br><br>
*  Associations with the colors:<br><br>
         Red = South<br>
         Green  = West<br>
         Dark Brown = North<br>
         Yellow = East<br>
         Orange = For the Solar God<br>
         Light Brown = For the Earth Mother<br><br>
*  Rotate the M & M:<br><br>
        M = 13th letter of alphabet, and there are 13 witches in a coven<br>
        3 = Triple Goddess, three phases of moon<br>
        W = Witchcraft, Wiccan<br>
        E  = Enlightenment<br>
<br><br>
<center>A PAGAN PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE<br>
 Author: WolfSquint<br><br>
I Pledge Allegiance,<br>
to the Earth,<br>
And all the Creatures which inhabit it,<br>
And to the Oceans,<br>
Which Give us Life<br>
One Planet, under sky, inter-dependent<br>
With Energy, and sustenance for all.<br></center>
<br><br>

<br><br>
 TOP TEN REASONS WHY TRICK OR TREATING IS BETTER THAN SEX<br><br>
     
     10) You are guaranteed to get at least a little something in the sack. <br>
     
     9) If you get tired, you can wait 10 minutes and go at it again. <br>
     
     8) The uglier you look, the easier it is to get some.  <br>
     
     7) You don't have to compliment the person who gives you some. <br>
     
     6) It's O.K. when the person you're with fantasizes you're someone else,  because you are. <br>
     
     5) Forty years from now you'll still enjoy candy. <br>
     
     4) If you don't like what you get, you can always go next  door. <br>
     
     3) It doesn't matter if the kids hear you moaning and  groaning. <br>
     
     2) Less guilt the morning after. <br>
     
     1) YOU CAN DO THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD. <br>
<br><br>

CATS.............<br><br>
On the first day of creation, God created the cat.<br>
 On the second day, God created man to serve the cat.<br>
 On the third, God created all the animals of the earth to serve as potential food for the cat.<br>
 On the fourth day, God created honest toil so that man could labor for the good of the cat.<br>
 On the fifth day, God created the sparkle ball so that the cat might or might not play with it.<br>
 On the sixth day, God created veterinary science to keep the cat healthy and the man broke.<br>
 On the seventh day, God tried to rest, but he had to scoop the litterbox.<br>

Twas The Night Before Samhain<br><br>

     'Twas the night before Samhain and all through the house,<br>
     Not a creature was stirring except for my spouse.<br>
     The incense it burned in his Caldron so black,<br>
     For witchcraft and magic he'd a wondrous knack.<br>
     The circle was drawn with the athame of power,<br>
     The guardians were called to each quarter tower.<br>
     The Lord and the Lady attended our rite,<br>
     In wonder and glory and power and might.<br>
     The dearly departed came as our guest,<br>
     To live once again after their rest.<br>
     We bid them goodbye with a tear in our eye,<br>
     Such a lovely presence of loved ones so nigh.<br>
     The candles danced in the flickering light.<br>
     With the Great Rite we bid them all a good night.<br>
     The guardians thanked, have all sped away.<br>
     The Lord and the Lady, thanks for the day.<br>
     The night before Samhain, Gods Bless this house.<br>
     A circle of wonder 'round me and my spouse.<br>
