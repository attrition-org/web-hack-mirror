<H3>This Study Guide comes from the many questions which arose when I read 'Ways of the Strega' by Raven Grimassi.  The Questions are chapter by chapter to help you through the book. Even if you have read the book before I urge you to sit down with it again and answer these questions.  Some are easy; some will challenge your thought process and all will help you gain a deeper knowledge of 'La Vecchia Religione'. You may want to keep a journal.  The information presented on my site does not even come close to exploring all that is 'Stregheria'.  </h3>
<br><br>
All questions are property of Fabrisia and may not be reproduced without my consent.
