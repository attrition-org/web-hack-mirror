<b>Nice site. The last time I heard so much about the Strega was back in the '70's, when Leo Martello was pushing it. I like what you've put together here, although it would be more appropriate to attribute your opening line to its real source: Aleister Crowley's Hymn To The Star Goddess, written for Gerald Gardner. As the Scorpio born on Hallowe'en, I was interested in what you had to say about Hallows. The story about Jack is interesting, but I have to wonder where anyone got a turnip (not to mention a potato or beet) large enough to make it into a lantern. Thanks for the great site!</b><br>
