<B><I>
For thousands of years women (and men) have collected plants to be used as healing medicines. They gathered the herbs by the waning and waxing moon, the cycles of the seasons, the ebb and flow of the universe and the natural rhythms of their bodies.  This wisdom is and was passed on from mother to daughter, and teacher to apprentice.
<br><br>
It was around the 14th century when the 'witch-hunts' began in Europe and herbalism encountered its first big obstacle. These skills were feared by the Roman Catholic Church and thousands would be persecuted for using herbs. Despite the Church teachings that using herbs was evil, many, such as the followers of Aradia, met in secret to worship and pass on their knowledge. Though there are many different herbs employed in the religious, and magical, aspects of La Vecchia, there are a few which hold special importance. These are the herbs called: Rue, Fennel, Pennyroyal, and Rosemary.<br><br>
Rue is so deeply connected to Witchlore, that it appears in many different aspects of the Tradition. It is a healing plant, and a magical plant. Rue bears yellow flowers in the shape of a pentagram, against a lush green foliage. It is a symbol of the God in the mythos/mysteries and appears in several of the Treguenda. Fennel is a plant associated with protection. It's long stalks (up to six or seven feet) were used as ritual staffs, at such rites as mid-summer, to "fight off" evil and protect the Crops from spirits of destruction. In ritual drama, witches would battle evil spirits in a war to ensure a bountiful crop. Pennyroyal has been used as an herb of initiation, even in the early public Roman Tradition.  Rosemary was used in the early Marriage Rites, and also in the Rites for the Dead. It was associated with Love and with Death. It is also used in an oil employed in Pastlife Recall, as rosemary is also called the Herb of Memory.
<br><br>
Various herbs were associated with a certain Goddess, God, or Spirit. These herbs were then offered up as incense to "attract" them to the work at hand. The ancients taught that prayers or requests were carried upon the smoke of the incense. So what better way to be "heard" by the gods, than to send your words upward upon the scent of their favorite plant! 
<br><br>
Today, herbalism is once again flourishing. Whether you use herbs in magick, spells, charms or healings (and don't forget cooking!), we are cultivating our ancient traditions. Work with Herbs, dig in the Earth, commune with Nature, find a plant Familiar: these are all ways to reestablish our connection to the heart and soul of Mother Earth.<br><br>

 I will also encourage you to read books on Herbs and their uses and make no guarantee that these Herbs will work as described. I urge you to seek out other Herbalists and those more experienced with Herbs and Plants before  trying any 'magick'. And as always, if your illness is serious, please consult a doctor.</h4><p><br><br>

<center><H2><B>RUE</B></H2>
<br>
<I>'Here in this place <br>
I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace; <br>
Rue, even for ruth, shall shortly here be seen, <br>
In the remembrance of a weeping queen.' <br>
~~Richard III, Shakespeare </i></center>
<br><br>
--Description-- Rue (Ruta graveolens), also known as Herb-of-Grace, Herbygrass, and Garden Rue, is a hardy, evergreen, somewhat shrubby plant, is a native of Southern Europe. The stem is woody in the lower part, the leaves are bluish-green, and emit a powerful, disagreeable odor and have an exceedingly bitter and nauseous taste. The greenish-yellow flowers are in bloom usually from June to September. The first flower that opens has usually ten stamens, the others eight only. 
<br><br>
--History-- The name Ruta is from the Greek 'reuo' (to set free), because this herb is so efficacious in various diseases. It was much used by the Ancients; Hippocrates specially commended it, and it constituted a chief ingredient of the famous antidote to poison used by Mithridates. The Greeks regarded it as an anti-magical herb, because it served to remedy the nervous indigestion they suffered when eating before strangers, which they attributed to witchcraft. In the Middle Ages and later, it was considered - in many parts of Europe - a powerful defense against witches, and was used in many spells. It was also thought to bestow second sight. Rue is said to grow best if stolen.
<br><br>
---Growing---The plant grows almost anywhere, but thrives best in a partially sheltered and dry situation. Propagation may be effected: (1) by seeds, sown outside, broadcast, in spring, raked in and the beds kept free from weeds, the seedlings, when about 2 inches high, being transplanted into fresh beds, allowing about 18 inches each way, as the plants become busy; (2) by cuttings, taken in spring and inserted for a time, until well rooted, in a shady border; (3) by rooted slips, also taken in spring. Every slip or cutting of the young wood will readily grow, and this is the most expeditious way of raising a stock. Rue will live much longer and is less liable to be injured by frost in winter when grown in a poor, dry, rubbishy soil than in good ground. 
<br><br>
---Parts Used ---The whole herb is used, the drug consisting of both the fresh and the dried herb. The tops of the young shoots contain the greatest virtues of any part of the plant. The shoots are gathered before the plant flowers. 
The volatile oil is contained in glands distributed over the whole plant and contains caprinic, plagonic, caprylic and oenanthylic acids - also a yellow crystalline body, called rutin. Oil of Rue is distilled from the fresh herb. Water serves to extract the virtues of the plant better than spirits of wine. Decoctions and infusions are usually made from the fresh plant, or the oil may be given in a dose of from 1 to 5 drops. The dried herb - which is a greyish green - has similar taste and odour, but is less powerful. It is used, powdered, for making tea. 
<br><br>
---Uses---Strongly stimulating and antispasmodic - often employed, in form of a warm infusion, as an emmenagogue. In excessive doses, it is an acro-narcotic poison, and on account of its emetic tendencies should not be administered immediately after eating.  It forms a useful medicine in hysterical affections, in coughs, croupy affections, colic and flatulence, being a mild stomachic. The oil may be given on sugar, or in hot water.  Externally, Rue is an active irritant, being employed as a rubefacient. If bruised and applied, the leaves will ease the severe pain of sciatica. The expressed juice, in small quantities, was a noted remedy for nervous nightmare, and the fresh leaves applied to the temples are said to relieve headache. Compresses saturated with a strong decoction of the plant, when applied to the chest, have been used beneficially for chronic bronchitis.  If a leaf or two be chewed, a refreshing aromatic flavour will pervade the mouth and any nervous headache, giddiness, hysterical spasm, or palpitation will be quickly relieved.

<center><H2>ROSEMARY</H2>
<br>
<I>'As for Rosemary, I let it run all over my garden walls, not only because my bees love it, but because it is the herb sacred to remembrance, and, therefore, to friendship.'<br>
~~Sir Thomas More</i></center><br><br>
--Description--The plant itself is very pretty in the herb garden-and most herb gardens have this plant in it! You can get rosemary in a prostrate or creeping variety. The leaves look like a pine tree, with some rosemaries taking on the odor of pine. You can start the plant by layering or cutting or from seed, however, that takes the longest. Plant it in a well drained spot to keep it from root rotting. It is recommended to take 4" cuttings when harvesting-which can be done anytime of the year. The flowers are small and blue, sometimes pink and white. The evergreen leaves of this shrubby herb are about 1 inch long. There are silver and goldstriped varieties, but the green-leaved variety is the kind used medicinally.
<br><br>
--History--When a twig of rosemary is burned  it is said  that it rids the place of negativity because of its cleansing vibrations. It was burnt at shrines in Ancient Greece, and burned to drive away evil spirits and to drive away illnesses. Place a fresh twig beneath your pillow to drive away nightmares, or lay it under your bed for a good nights sleep. A necklace made from rosemary preserves your youth and is said that it is also grown to attract elves. The Ancients were well acquainted with the shrub, which had a reputation for strengthening the memory. On this account it became the emblem of fidelity for lovers. It holds a special position among herbs from the symbolism attached to it. Not only was it used at weddings, but also at funerals, for decking churches and banqueting halls at festivals, as incense in religious ceremonies, and in magical spells. Both in Spain and Italy, it has been considered a safeguard from witches and evil influences generally. The Sicilians believe that young fairies, taking the form of snakes, lie amongst the branches. It was an old custom to burn Rosemary in sick chambers, and in French hospitals it is customary to burn Rosemary with Juniper berries to purify the air and prevent infection
<br><br>
--Growing--Rosemary is propagated by seeds, cuttings and layers, and division of roots. (1) Seeds may be sown upon a warm, sunny border. (2) Cuttings, taken in August, 6 inches long, and dibbled into a shady border, two-thirds of their length in the ground, under a hand-glass, will root and be ready for transplanting into permanent quarters the following autumn. (3) Layering may be readily accomplished in summer by pegging some of the lower branches under a little sandy soil.  Rosemary succeeds best in a light, rather dry soil, and in a sheltered situation, such as the base of a low wall with a south aspect. On a chalk soil it grows smaller, but is more fragrant. The silver- and gold-striped kinds are not quite so hardy. 
<br><br>
--Parts Used--The oil of rosemary is extrated by distilation by steam of the flower tops for the purer oil, and of the whole plant for a poorer quality. Once you feel the rosemary plant, you can easily see where the oil comes from, being you have this sticky stuff on your fingers.
<br><br>
--Uses--The essential oil is blended well with lavender, citronella, oregano, basil, peppermint, cedarwood, thyme, and cinnamon. The oil is used for many things, including aromatherapy, which includes health care for acne, varicose veins, muscular pain, asthma and broncitis, colds and flu, headaches and stress related disorders. It is used in the making of soaps and perfumes, household sprays, cosmetics and alcoholic beverages.

<center><H2>FENNEL</H2>
<br>
<I>'Above the lower plants it towers, <br>
The Fennel with its yellow flowers; <br>
And in an earlier age than ours <br>
Was gifted with the wondrous powers <br>
Lost vision to restore.' <br>
~~Longfellow</i></center><br><br>

--Description--Fennel (also called sweet fennel) is a striking 6-foot tall perennial with feathery leaves and tall stalks . Bright-gold flowers, which appear in summer have an umbrella-like structure similar to Dill. When you crush the leaves and fruit of the fennel, you will become immediately aware of its strong, anise like fragrance. Herbal fragranceof whatever kind is always a sure indication of the presence ofessential oils. In fennel's case these are anethol (the same oil contained in anise) and fenchone. Fennel also contains traces of potassium, sodiumand sulphur. The Common Garden Fennel (F. Capillaceum ) is distinguished from its wild relative (F. vulgare) by having much stouter, taller, tubular and larger stems, and less divided leaves, but the chief distinction is that the leaf-stalks form a curved sheath around the stem, often even as far as the base of the leaf above. 
<br><br>
--History--Fennel was well known to the Ancients and was cultivated by the ancient Romans for its aromatic fruits and succulent, edible shoots. In mediaeval times, Fennel was employed, together with St. John's Wort and other herbs, as a preventative of witchcraft and other evil influences, being hung over doors on Midsummer's Eve to warn off evil spirits. 
<br><br>
--Growing-- Fennel will grow practically anywhere, ideally in a light, well-drained soil. But it does need plenty of sun. If sown early in April it may growup to 5 feet in height by the end of the summer, so be careful where youplace it in your garden. Be warned, however, that many other plants dislike fennel and grow poorly when forced to share space with this strong herb. Never plant fennel near coriander or dill. Harvest seeds in late summer as they turn greenish-gray. It is easily propagated by seeds, sown early in April in ordinary soil. It likes plenty of sun and is adapted to dry and sunny situations, not needing heavily manured ground, though it will yield more on rich stiff soil.
<br><br>
--Parts Used-- The tiny oval fruits (seeds) are ribbed and greenish gray. All parts of the plant have the herb's characteristic licorice fragrance. The seeds are  employed in the making of cordials and liqueurs, and is also used in perfumery and for scenting soaps. 
<br><br>
--Uses--A tea made with a few fresh sprigs of fennel or a level teaspoon of seeds will relieve indigestion. 
Seeds can be chewed as a breath freshener. The odour of Fennel seed is fragrant, its taste, warm, sweet and agreeably aromatic. It yields its virtues to hot water, but more freely to alcohol. The essential oil may be separated by distillation with water. It is one of the plants which is said to be disliked by fleas, and powdered Fennel has the effect of driving away fleas from kennels and stables. The plant gives off ozone most readily. In Italy and France, the tender leaves areoften used for garnishes and to add flavour to salads, and are also added, finely chopped, to sauces served with puddings. Roman bakers are said to put the herb under their loaves in the oven to make the bread taste agreeably.  The tender stems are employed in soups in Italy, though are more frequently eaten raw as a salad.

<br><br><br>
<center><H2>PENNYROYAL</H2></center>
<br><br>
--Description--Pennyroyal is the smallest of the Mints. The leaves are opposite, shortly stalked, more or less hairy on both sides, roundish oval, greyish green, about 1 to 1 1/2 inch long and 1/2 inch broad. The seed is light brown, oval and very small. Pennyroyal is highly aromatic, perhaps even more so than any other Mint, containing an essential oil resembling in properties that of other mints, though less powerful. The flavour is more pungent and acrid and less agreeable than that of Spearmint or Peppermint. Other names are: Run-by-the-Ground, Lurk-in-the-Ditch, Pudding Grass. 
<br><br>
--Growing--It is easily grown from seed and succeeds best in loamy soil, in a moist situation, but propagation is commonly by division of old roots in autumn or spring. In planting, allow a space of 12 inches between the rows and 6 inches between the plants in the row. Water shortly afterwards should the weather be at all dry. When a good stock of healthy roots has been obtained, Pennyroyal may be forced with advantage. The creeping underground roots grow in horizontal masses, as with the other mints and if some of these are taken up at any time during the winter and laid out on a bed of good soil, covering them with 2 or 3 inches of the same, they will soon push up fresh shoots in quantity. They can be put in boxes in a moderately warm house or pit. 
<br><br>
--Parts Used--Pennyroyal is mostly sold in the dry state for making tea, the stems being cut when the plant is just about to flower and dried in the usual manner. Pennyroyal Water was distilled from the leaves and given as an antidote to spasmodic, nervous and hysterical affections. It was also used against cold and 'affections of the joints.' Pennyroyal should 'never' be used by pregnant women.
<br><br>
--Uses--Its action is carminative, diaphoretic, stimulant and emmenagogic, and is principally employed for the last-named property in disorders caused by sudden chill or cold. 
It is also beneficial in cases of spasms, hysteria, flatulence and sickness, being very warming and grateful to the stomach.
