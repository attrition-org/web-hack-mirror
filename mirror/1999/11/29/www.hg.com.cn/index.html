<p align="center">Im no preacher or anything, but I really do
want to say that I am personally sad to see what hacking has come
to. Hacking nowadays is in no way at all what it used to be. Look
at the attrition archives of hacked pages at <a
href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition">www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition</a>
and ask yourself.. What message do the hacks of say.. take
November 1999 carry out? I have seen nothing this month at all
but a bunch of people hacking say the dept. of energy or NASA
jpl's and put &quot;owned by the cartweel kids!&quot; with a
bunch of shouts. Now, im not saying im some fuqin saint either
trying to spread this world wide message, but what we are doing
(and when I say we, I speak for <u>all</u> hackers.) serves no
purpose. Who gives a (excuse the word) shit if you can get into
Microsoft or the Navy? We always talk about how the media doesn't
know who we are, and they rush to the conclusion that we are
little fat techno kids sitting behind out keyboards waiting to
steal peoples credit, but with the crap everyone pulls, how can
they not think this? Everyone's been <u>abusing</u> the
governments systems this month, and for what reason? To put
shouts to their irc buddys and get posted on attrition? I just
think that we should be more creative as Jericho from attrition
said. Put up a page, back up their index.html files, mail the
admin from their own system even and tell them how you got in and
how they can prevent how you got in for future reference. When
you're gonna deface something, try and make it for a purpose, not
just for the hell of it, why would anyone want to waste their
time owning something and risking getting caught (theres always a
risk.) to just put shouts on a page? And I know I have done that
too, and im not trying to talk shit either, im just trying to
say, we should try and change what we're doing.. hell, theres
plenty of news on the net about computer shit and the govt. goin
on that we can write about.. anyways, this letters getting long,
and im getting bored.</p>
