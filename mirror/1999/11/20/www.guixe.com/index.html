a beautiful ICP song...


Let's meet contestant number one He's a skitsofrantic, serial killer clown Who says, "woman love his sexy smile"
Let's find out if his charm will work on Sharon Sharon, what's your question? 

"Contestant number one, I believe first impressions last forever So let's say you were to come over to my parent's
house And have dinner with me and my family Tell me what you would do to make That first impression really
stick" 

Let's see, uh, well, I'd have to think about it I might show up in a tux, HA!, but I doubt it I'd probably just show up
naked like I always do And lick your momma in the eye and tell her, "FUCK YOU!!!" Hurry up bitch, I'm hungry, I
smell spaghetti I'd kick her in the butt and tell her, "Get the food ready!" Your dad will probably start tripping and
get me pissed I'd have to walk up and bust him in his fucking lips! It's dinner time, we hearing grace from your
mother I pull a forty out and pour some for your little brother I'm steady staring at your sister, I'll tell you this You
know for only 13, she got some big tits After that, your dad will try to jump again And only this time, I'd put the
forty to his chin After you mom does the dishes and the silverware I'd dry-fuck her till I nut in my underwear 

Now, let's me contestant number two He's a psychopathic, deranged, crackhead freak Who works for the Dark
Carnival He says women call him stretch nuts Sharon, let's hear your question 

"I like a man who's not afraid to show his true emotions A man who expresses himself in his own special way
Number two, if you fell in love with me Exactly how would you let me know?" 

First thing, I could never love you You sound like a little richie-bitch, FUCK YOU!!! But if I did, I'd probably show
you that I care By taking all these other motherfuckers outta here I'd go through your phone book and kill em all
And find contestant number one and break his fucking jaw (what?!) Anyone who looked at you, would have to
pay I'd be blowing fucking nuggets off all day I'd tell you that I love you and if you don't say it back I'd have to
choke slam your neck and dislocate your back I'd sing love songs to you, the best I can And then I club you in
the head like a CAVEMAN!!! When we go to the beach and walk through the sand I throw a little in your face
and say, I'm just playin As you spit it all out, I'd rub your back And grab your underwear and wedge it up your
ass crack!! 

Well it sounds like contestant number two Is just over-flowing with sensativity, Sharon It's a touch choice so far
Sharon, let's have your last question and See which one is going to win the rights to your neden 

"Okay, if we were at a dance club, and you both noticed me at the same time. Tell me, how would you each get my
attention, and what would your pick up line be? Well, whoever's the smoothest wins!" 

Okay, first I'd slide up to the bar And tell you that I can't believe how fucking fat you are I'd tell that I like the way
you make your titties shake And if you lost a little wait, you'd look like Rickie Lake! 

Fuck that, you'd be jocking me quick I'd order you a drink and stir it with my dick And then to get your attention
in the crowded place I'd simply walk up and slap you in the fucking face 

Yeah, smack her in the mouth, yo, that'll get her Tell her that's she fat, yeah, that'll work even better Look, fuck
you, I got a strong rap Shit, you don't want contestant number two He's mad-whack 

I walk into a bar and there he was Standing up on a bucket, eww, trying to fuck it It was a big fucking smelly, ass
farm llama Damn dawg! how you gonna diss your momma?!
