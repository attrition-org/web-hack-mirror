			<hr>
			The year 2000 (Y2K) is fast approaching and many people are
			becoming concerned about the possible effects of the
			"Millennium Bug".  Simply stated, many computer programs and
			computer chips only use 2 digits to represent the year and
			will not work correctly when the year becomes "00". No one
			really knows how serious the impact of this event will be.
			There is a potential for interruptions to power, which could
			affect a number of things.  For example, water pressure,
			traffic signals, and access to computers.
			<p>
			The City of Fresno is taking Y2K very seriously and is
			committed to guarding the public safety and bringing all of
			our technology into compliance.  Our efforts began in January
			1998 with a citywide survey to identify non-compliant hardware
			and software applications.  Since that time we have been
			working diligently to upgrade or replace these systems as
			necessary.  Our citywide Y2K project team is currently meeting
			every two weeks to centralize information, conduct contingency
			planning, and promote public awareness.
			<p>
			Thank You for your interest in this very important issue.
			Please continue to visit this site for monthly status reports,
			notification of special events, personal preparedness
			information, and more as we count down to the year 2000!!
