		The Y2K Inter-Agency Coordination Team Four (4) Fold Mission
		<ol>
		<li>Help each other to get the Y2K job done.  Coordinate with, and support each
		other in getting all of our own systems compliant for Y2K.  As an added benefit
		we have succeeded in achieving a higher level of cooperation and trust between
		the member agencies than in past years.
		<li>Inform residents that all essential services are Y2K compliant.  By meetings,
		publications, and press briefings we want to inform all residents, businesses,
		and community service providers throughout Fresno County that our essential services,
		infrastructure, and the computer systems used to provide those services are Y2K ready.
		<li>Assure residents that contingency plans are in place.  In addition to Y2K readiness
		we are better prepared for any emergency than ever before.  By this joint effort we wish
		to communicate to Fresno County residents that their government agencies have thought
		through the numerous emergency and disaster possibilities and have responses and
		contingency plans in place.
		<li>Encourage all residents to prepare themselves for emergencies.  While we have put
		forth a great effort it is not possible for us to take care of everything for everybody.
		The "Preparing Your Family for a Disaster" handout is a joint effort to assist residents
		with how to prepare themselves.  Every individual, family, business, community group,
		and church needs to be better prepared for any potential emergency.  The recent tornado
		in Salt Lake City is an example of unexpected things that can happen.  It was impressive
		how quickly city, state, and private agencies were in place in Salt Lake.  Our County
		Office of Emergency Services already has the same level of planning, commitment, and
		inter-agency coordination in place for Fresno County residents.
