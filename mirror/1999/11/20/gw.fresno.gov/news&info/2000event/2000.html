<br>&nbsp;
<p>There is no doubt that people around the world have been preparing for
the new millennium for the last decade. But you may have noticed that the
latest buzz around the valley is about Fresno's millennium celebration
to be held here in downtown Fresno. It is Fresno's goal to host a regional
event so that we may provide a free, safe, fun-filled environment where
citizens of all ages, all over the central valley can ring in the new year.&nbsp;
<p>We decided to hold a "Name the Millennium Celebration" Contest so that
we could involve the valley's citizen in our millennium plans. We opened
the contest to kindergarden through high school students throughout the
San Joaquin Valley to give them a chance to give us their ideas regarding
the millennium. The Fresno Bee was happy to sponsor our contest and they
took care of spreading the word to the valley's students. To our elation,
we received over 125 entries from students at literally every corner of
the valley. We outlined the contest to honor not only a grand prize winner,
but also a category winner from each of the following: kindergarden through
3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> through 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> through
8<sup>th</sup>, and 9<sup>th</sup> through 12<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp;
<p>Our K-3rd winner is Michael Robbins of Fresno, Ca. He is nine years
old and a 3<sup>rd</sup> grader at Mountain View School. Our 4-6th winner
is Alexandria Walker of Chowchilla, Ca. She is eleven years old and a 5<sup>th</sup>
grader at St. Joachim School. Our 7-8th winner is Jamie Meadows of Clovis,
Ca. She is fourteen years old and an 8<sup>th</sup> grader at Fresno Christian
School. Our 9<sup>th</sup>-12th and overall grand prize winner is Jesse
Owen of Visalia, Ca. He is seventeen years old and just finished his junior
year at Redwood High School. Jesse will receive a limousine ride to dinner
for four and he and his guests will be honored at our kick-off parade that
afternoon. Thanks to Jesse and all of our other outstanding entries, we
now have a logo and design for our "Fresno 2000 Millennium Celebration."
