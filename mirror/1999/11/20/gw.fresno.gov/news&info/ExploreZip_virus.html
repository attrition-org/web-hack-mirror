	Please pay attention to your e-mail attachments names.

<p><b>W32/ExploreZip.worm</b> is a worm that infects Windows systems. It is very dangerous,
potentially more destructive than Melissa. It reproduces itself by sending replies to incoming
email messages, with itself as an attachment called "zipped_files.exe". It includes a  payload:
it will search the user's hard drive and delete all files of  types .c, .cpp, .asm, .doc, .xls, .ppt.  

<p><em>IMPORTANT</em>:  If you receive an email with the message:
<blockquote><i>"I received  your email and I shall send you a reply ASAP. Till then, take a look at
the attached zipped docs."</i></blockquote>
delete it immediately! It will have an attachment called "zipped_files.exe".
<p><b>Do not double-click or run this attachment!</b><br>If you do, it will infect your system!
