face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;U.S. privacy groups on
Thursday filed a lawsuit to block new federal wiretapping rules
which would require tracking of cell phone users and monitoring
of the internet. The law would require telephone companies to
build wiretapping capability into all high speed data lines, and
require cellular networks to track the physical location of all
their customers. &quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">i guess the government is
gonna try and tell us some crap like this is in our best
interest.. sure, tap my lines, and invade my privacy.. little by
little they keep on trying to take our rights away in the least
direct ways. No matter what, there are some things they cannot
take away from us, and that is the knowledge we have acquired..
don't stop hacking.. show them we don't give a shit.. the media
can make up all the crap they want about us to turn the public
against us, but what the un-informed public does not know is that
without the assistance of hackers, many of <u>their</u> systems
would not be secure today. It isn't going to stop here, and it
never will stop. <u>We</u> wont stop, until you understand what
we are, what we do, and why we do it.</font></p>
