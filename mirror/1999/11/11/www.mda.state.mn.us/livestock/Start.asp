<pre>
The 1999 Minnesota Legislature directed the Minnesota Department of Agriculture 
to collect information from livestock packers about the prices paid to farmers for 
swine and cattle.  The legislation also requires the MDA to make this pricing
information available to the public, so long as the pricing information does not 
disclose a packer’s proprietary information or a seller’s identity.

Please note that the information presented here was reported to MDA for livestock 
purchased on the day previous to the date shown.
