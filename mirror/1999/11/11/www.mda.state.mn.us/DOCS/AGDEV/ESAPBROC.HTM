</P>
<P ALIGN="left">The Energy and Sustainable Agriculture Program was established in 1987 in response to concerns over the impact of conventional agricultural practices on farm profitability, health and the environment.  The purpose of the program is to demonstrate and promote alternative practices which are energy efficient, environmentally sound, profitable and which enhance the self-sufficiency of Minnesota farmers.
</P>
<P ALIGN="left"><I><B>Vision</B> - Agriculture in Minnesota will be based on dynamic, flexible farming systems that are profitable, efficient, productive and founded on ethics of land stewardship and responsibility for the continuing vitality of local rural communities.  Minnesotans will strive to understand and respect the complex interconnectedness of living systems, from soil to people, so as to protect and enhance all natural resources for future generations.  Minnesota agriculture will sustain an abundance of food and other products as well as meaningful, self-directed employment that supports the quality of life desired by farmers and rural communities.  Agriculture will foster diversity in all its forms of production, products, markets and cultures.
</I></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><I><B>Mission</B> - To work toward the goal of sustainability for Minnesota agriculture by designing and implementing programs that meet the identified needs and support the creativity of Minnesota farmers.</I>

<P ALIGN="left"><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="Teal">SHARED SAVINGS LOAN PROGRAM</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="left">A $1 million revolving fund provides loans to farmers to support the transition to sustainable practices.  Loans of up to $15,000 per farmer at a 6% interest rate enable farmers to purchase equipment or make other improvements to enhance profitability and the environment.

Applications are accepted year round and are competitively reviewed by a loan review panel at a fall and a late winter meeting.</P>

<P ALIGN="left"><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="Teal">DEMONSTRATION GRANTS</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="left">The Demonstration Grant Program provides funds for farmers, agricultural researchers, educators and non-profit groups to explore innovative and creative ways to enhance the sustainability of a wide range of farming systems.  Grants of up to $25,000 are awarded on a competitive basis for three year demonstration projects.

Since 1989, the program has funded 114 demonstration projects throughout Minnesota.  Funded projects have demonstrated management intensive grazing, diversified cropping systems, soil fertility and manure management, alternative weed management options, low-capital beginning farmer strategies, marketing and specialty crop opportunities.  Grant projects have confirmed that creative and integrated management of on-farm renewable resources can successfully replace purchased inputs and increase the profitability of farm operations.

Grant recipients share what they are doing and what they have learned through field tours and other public information avenues.  Results of grant projects are published annually in the  Greenbook, available from the Program.

<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="Teal"><B>ON-FARM RESEARCH</B></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN="left">The Program directs on-farm research efforts in practical farming alternatives.  In cooperation with agricultural professionals, researchers and participating farmers, the Program conducts farm-scale research on such topics as organic transition methods, non-chemical weed control, non- nutrient benefits of manure, forage species performance and the contribution of green manures, livestock manure and compost to soil quality.

<P ALIGN="left"><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="Teal">FIELD DAYS, WORKSHOPS AND SPEAKERS
</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="left">The Program sponsors workshops and field days on diverse topics with many farmer, agency, academic, non-profit and local partners.  Field days offer a first hand look at successful, working, sustainable farms.  Workshops and forums offer opportunities for information gathering and an exchange of ideas.  Program staff are available as speakers, moderators or facilitators for meetings or other gatherings.

</P>
<P ALIGN="left">Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was initiated in the 1985 Federal Farm Bill to  conserve and improve soil and water resources by reducing soil erosion and sedimentation in streams and lakes, to improve fish and wildlife habitats, to curb production of surplus commodities and to provide needed income support for farmers.  Most of Minnesota's 1.9 million CRP acres will be released from contract in 1996 and 1997.

ESAP's CRP Project was begun in 1994 to 1) identify CRP lands most critical to preserving Minnesota's soil and water quality; and 2) identify and address contract holder information needs as land returns to production.  Based on farmer meetings and surveys, and with numerous partners, the project produced, and has available, fact sheets and market analyses on a variety of sustainable management practices for land that will emerge from CRP.  Demonstrations, on-farm research results, and workshops are being held to inform contract holders.  Also, the location of CRP lands is available in digital form for most counties.
