<TD COLSPAN="2"><B>Buckwheat to Suppress Weeds and Mobilize Phosphorus.</B>  We are comparing buckwheat with two other cover crops (sorghum-sudangrass and an oat/pea mixture) as well as with the conventional practice of disk-fallow, to see their effect on weed control and phosphorus fertility for the subsequent crop.  Field day guests will see farm-scale replicated plots of the three cover crops and fallow at different stages of maturity.  Later this summer these will all be turned under and planted to oats/peas in preparation for sugarbeets next spring.  We will continue to monitor the phosphorus levels and weeds in these crops to see the long-term effects of the different cover crops.</TD>

The intent is to add biomass to a low residue crop without reducing crop yield.  This project is bringing the research findings to producers.  Each participating producer has a 10-acre plot of sunflower or corn, interseeded with vetch, next to a plot without the vetch.  At the end of the season plot yields are compared.  No yield reduction in the main crop has been found.  The vetch can protect the soil from erosion, fix nitrogen, and add organic matter to the soil.  Some producers let their cattle graze the vetch.</TD>

Plots were monitored for yield, forage quality, soil pH and fertility, and species composition.  The purpose of the project is to find out if low levels of lime applied annually cause yield or quality improvement.</TD>

Using a Vicon pendulum seeder driven hydraulically, we interseed during second cultivation.  We hope to determine which interseeded crops perform best in the corn/soybean rotation, assess the effect of the interseeded crop on pest, disease, and weed cycles; and determine the effects of an interseeded crop on plant available water for the grain crops.</TD>
