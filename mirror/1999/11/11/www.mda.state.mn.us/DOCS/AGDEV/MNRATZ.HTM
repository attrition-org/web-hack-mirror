Introduction: 
<BR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="center"><B>Minnesota River Agriculture Initiative and Minnesota River Agriculture Team (MnRAT)</B></P>
<P><BR>

<B>What is the Minnesota River Agriculture Initiative?</B></P>
<P>

Several government agencies have been conducting research and monitoring projects to assess the water quality of the Minnesota River.  These assessments have identified agriculture as one of several potential contributors of non-point source pollution (NPS) to the Minnesota River.</P>
<P>

The Minnesota Department of Agriculture, as part of the 1993-95 biennial budget, proposed an initiative that would bring producers and agencies into a closer working relationship.  The request, entitled the Minnesota River Initiative, was approved and funded along with several other NPS initiatives.</P>
<P>

<B>What is the purpose of the Minnesota River Agriculture Initiative?</B></P>
<P>

The primary focus will be to inform producers of NPS problems being identified by state and federal natural resource agencies and institutions, and to involve producers in a meaningful dialogue to develop responses and activities of agencies and institutions.</P>
<P>

<B>Who is the MnRAT?</B></P>
<P>

The Minnesota River Agriculture Team (MnRAT) is an advisory task force appointed by the Commissioner of Agriculture to provide guidance on how to best carry out the initiative.  More specifically, the Team will suggest ways on how to best involve producers in developing policies and finding solutions to NPS problems, as well as advise on how to establish a working partnership among producers and agencies.  The Team will also look at ways to best coordinate and deliver NPS programs to producers.</P>
<P>

<B>What are the major objectives of the initiative?</B>

</P>
<OL>
<LI>To inform and involve producers in NPS activities of local, state, federal agencies and institutions; 
</LI>
<LI>To develop a coordinated approach by all state and federal agriculture agencies and institutions; and 
</LI>
<LI>To sponsor public meetings, survey, focus group meetings, or other efforts that will help producers understand and communicate their concerns and suggestions about NPS.
</LI>
</OL>

<HR NOSHADE SIZE="5">
<P>

<B>What does the MnRAT hope to accomplish?</B></P>
<P>

MnRAT hopes to accomplish the following:  ask producers how they would like to be involved, conduct meetings on available services and programs, determine what services producers need, and solicit ideas from producers on potential solutions.</P>
<P>

The MnRAT also hopes to develop and implement an information and communications strategy with producers.  Another objective is to identify opportunities for cooperation among producers and agencies,  as well as to identify how programs can better work together.</P>
<P>

<B>How will producers be involved in choosing solutions?</B></P>
<P>

The Team will work to have producers involved in the planning and delivery of NPS related programs.  This will entail formal representation on committees and working groups, as well as informal participation in public meetings and involvement in surveys and focus group meetings.</P>
<P>

<B>Who is involved in the MNRAT?</B></P>
<P>

The MnRAT includes producers and agriculture related government agencies and institutions.  The agencies include:  the Pollution Control Agency, Extension Service, Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts, Board of Water and Soil Resources, Department of Natural Resources, USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service (a.k.a. SCS), Metropolitan Council, the Region Nine Development Commission, and the University of Minnesota.</P>
<P>

<B>Who can be contacted for more information, including possible updates?</B></P>

MnRAT Chairperson:  Will Anthony (507-246-5292).<BR>
Minnesota Department of Agriculture:  Darla Riley (651-282-5140) and Mark Dittrich (651-296-1482).</P>
