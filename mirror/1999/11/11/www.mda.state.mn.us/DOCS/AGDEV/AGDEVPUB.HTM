<P>A pocket size resource book which provides contractors, educators, and Minnesota livestock and poultry producers quick access to sources of information related to feedlots and manure management.  The intent of the directory is to assist producers by helping them gain knowledge of restrictions, sources of assistance, and general information about manure management.  The directory is divided into ten sections, which include feedlot permits, federal cost share assistance, state cost share information, low interest loans, manure storage, manure treatment, manure management plans, an organizational directory, private contractors, and educational resources. </P>

<P>A planning guide providing Minnesota producers with general information on what factors to consider when changing their livestock manure management system.  This guide is intended to enable producers to determine  their manure management system planning assistance  needs  and to serve as a planning tool for successful manure management.  Topics that need to be considered when a producer changes or updates his manure management system are value of manure, permitting, neighbor relations, system option, environmental considerations,   manure utilization, cost share assistance, safety, and feedlot closure.  The goal of the guide is to provide the producer with the right questions to ask the right people in order to determine what manure management system would best fit the farm.</P>

<P>Many counties and other local governments in Minnesota are attempting to address issues relating to the siting and expansion of new and existing livestock feedlots.  This handbook provides practical planning assistance to local units of governments dealing with livestock-related land use issues.  It reviews trends related to animal agriculture in Minnesota, examines the current state and local planning and regulatory environment, and outlines strategies for sound land use planning for animal agriculture, with plan  implementation through zoning and other local controls.  A theme throughout this handbook is that land use issues regarding animal agriculture and feedlots are best addressed through thorough comprehensive planning, prior to enactment of land use regulations.</P>
