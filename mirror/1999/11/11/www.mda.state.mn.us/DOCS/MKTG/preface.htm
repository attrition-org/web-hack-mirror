<H1>Preface


</H1>
<P>Congratulations!  After serious consideration, you have decided to start a food business 
in Minnesota.  Starting your new business will be an exciting adventure as well as a challenge.  
</P>
<P>To assist you with the many steps involved, this publication is designed to help those who 
are interested in starting a food service establishment, retail food business or a food 
manufacturing business in Minnesota.  The publication's goal is to help new food business owners and 
employees understand the many regulatory requirements applicable to their business and produce 
and distribute safe, quality products to their customers.  To achieve its goal, this publication 
identifies the various state agencies and units of local government responsible for regulation; 
provides helpful checklists focusing on regulations, skills assessment and &quot;how to write a business 
plan&quot;; and addresses specific license and permit requirements, inspections, local regulation, tax 
considerations and issues for employers.  
</P>
<P>Each section of this booklet is designed to meet two objectives.  The first objective is to serve 
as a reference to the many regulations that must be followed for a food business.  The 
second objective is to serve as a quick and convenient checklist for planning your new business.
</P>
<P>Most food-related businesses will require initial and continuing contact with several 
agencies and units of government.  Contacting these entities in the early stages of planning your 
business is strongly encouraged.  This will familiarize you with the requirements, cost, and 
timetables associated with starting a new food business in Minnesota.  In addition, it is important that 
you understand the specific requirements and regulations mandated by the state and local agencies. 
 Failing to comply with them can result in penalties, revocation of licenses, or even closure 
of your business.
</P>
<P>Lastly, it is important for you to understand that this publication should not be used as a 
substitute for detailed reference to state laws and regulations, or as a substitute for competent 
legal advice.  Legislative action and changes in administrative rules may change their 
requirements from time to time; therefore, you should contact the appropriate regulatory agency for the 
most up-to-date information.  As with the start-up of any business, consultation with legal and 
accounting professionals is strongly recommended.
</P>
<P><I>Starting A Food Business in Minnesota</I> has been created by the Minnesota Department 
of Agriculture with assistance from the Minnesota Department of Health.
