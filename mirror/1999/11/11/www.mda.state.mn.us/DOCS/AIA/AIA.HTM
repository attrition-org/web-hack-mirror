<H2>Apiary Inspectors of America</H2>

<H3>Welcome to the AIA Home page</H3>

<P>What is the Apiary Inspectors of America?</P>

<P>The purpose of this organization is to promote better beekeeping
conditions in North America mainly through more uniform and effective
laws and methods for the suppression of bee diseases, and mutual
understanding and cooperation between apiary inspection officials,
and by the presentation of new information and ideas as developed.</P>

<H4>Who can Join AIA?</H4>

<P>Membership consists of state and Canadian provincial apiarists,
state bee inspectors, other regulatory officials that have apicultural
responsibilities and other professional apicultural specialists.</P>

<H4>What Do State Apiarists Do?</H4>

<P>State Apiarists spend much of their time serving in an extension
capacity with individual beekeepers as well as local and state
beekeeper associations. State Apiarists are in contact with Federal
and University research personnel and the National Honey Board
to keep abreast of the latest research findings and new methods
in apiculture. Most state apiarists are also very active in the
leadership of the state beekeeping organizations. In that role
they help in communication between beekeepers and promotion of
honey and the beekeeping industry.</P>

<H4>What About Inspectors?</H4>

<P>In many states the bee inspector is viewed as the bee expert
and serves as an industry spokesperson to the general public,
mass media reporters, legislators, and other public officials.
Bee inspectors also conduct or assist in a considerable amount
of bee research. For example, most of the early research on tracheal
and varroa mites was done in cooperation and assistance of several
state apiary inspectors. In these days with the shortages of bee
research, extension and regulatory funds it makes sense to share
resources.</P>

<H4>What About Education and Information?</H4>

<P>Several state apiarists have helped to develop class lesson
plans on bees for use in grade schools. Most state apiarists routinely
give talks on beekeeping to school classes and civic groups. Some
state apiarists have produced beekeeper directories used by consumers,
swarm callers, orchardists and other growers to make contacts
for honey, wax, and pollen products, beekeeping supplies and pollination
and other services. Many state apiarists also work with the university
extension service to disseminate extension bulletins, newsletters,
etc.</P>
