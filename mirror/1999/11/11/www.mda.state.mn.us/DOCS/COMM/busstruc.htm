<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dairy farming today is taking on various forms of business structures to help manage the 
day-to-day activities of the business.  Dairy farms are becoming larger and more complex, as 
multiple family owners, active and passive investors, and joint ventures spring up among the 
neighboring crop and livestock operations.  This document addresses the many questions that Minnesota 
dairy farmers have regarding business structures and farming operations.
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Challenges of Building a Dairy Business</FONT></B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today's dairy entrepreneurs are experiencing situations that dairy farmers have not had to face 
in the past. These include the increased use of hired labor, environmental  regulations, and the 
need for large sums of capital in growing dairy operations. To find 
<B>capital </B>and build <B>equity</B>, business partners are often needed to secure appropriate financing.  In addition, the Minnesota 
Corporate Farm Law is often misunderstood or misinterpreted. In  this regard, this paper should help 
guide you in deciding if your current business organization is meeting your needs, or if you need 
to choose a different form of business structure. 
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Definitions of Legal Structures in Minnesota
</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>**This is only a very basic, brief summary of the law.  Before you choose any business 
form, it is <U>very important</U> that you contact an attorney as to the legality and/or an accountant as 
to the tax and economic consequences.**</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Sole Proprietorship</B> - Owned by one person who has full control and responsibility for the 
business.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>General Partnership</B> - A partnership that has two or more owners who carry on a business 
and who share in the profits or losses. Each  partner is held liable for the full debts of the 
partnership if the partnership is not able to pay its debts. The partners can all participate in the 
management and each partner can bind the partnership to contractual obligations.
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Limited Partnerships </B>- The limited partnership has at least one general partner and at least 
one limited partner. The general partner are liable for the full debts of the partnership. The 
limited partners are not liable for the debts of the partnership unless they have personally 
guaranteed the partnership debt or are liable as a result of individual action other than being a 
limited partner. Limited partners are not allowed to participate in the management of the 
partnership business.
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Limited Liability Partnership 
</B>- This entity has an unlimited number of shareholders, but 
only natural persons, partnerships and other entities certified under the corporate farm law can 
participate. Partners may elect to have some of the partners have less than joint and several 
liability.
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Family Farm Corporations 
</B>- These entities have an unlimited number of shareholders, but 
the majority of the interest and the majority of the shareholders must be related within the 
3rd degree of kindred. Eligible shareholders include partnerships, natural persons, limited 
partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Authorized Farm Corporations 
</B>- Eligible shareholders must be natural persons. 
Shareholders are limited to five, but no relation is required. Limited liability is offered in this structure. As 
a general rule, a corporation is a tax paying entity, but it depends on whether the corporation 
is organized as  Subchapter &quot;C&quot; or Subchapter &quot;S.&quot; Dividends paid to shareholders, however, 
are fully taxable.

Companies</B> - ILLEGAL IN MINNESOTA FARMING OPERATIONS
</P>
<HR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Figure 1. illustrates various business structures and includes some options not currently legal 
in Minnesota for dairy operations. It is important to consult an attorney for legal advice 
when selecting and implementing a business. Information on how the Minnesota Corporate 
Farm Law is regulated and questions relating to the law can be addressed to the Minnesota 
Department of Agriculture, 90 West Plato Blvd., St. Paul, MN 55108. Attention: Corporate Farm 
Law Administrator.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any combination of the above can be used, with an unlimited amount of shareholders, however a majority of 
the shareholders must be related within the 3rd degree of kindred and non-natural persons can not be related 
to individuals.  The related individuals must make up the majority of shareholders and must own the majority of 
the voting stock.
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notice that no 
<U>corporations</U> or <U>limited liability 
companies</U>  are eligible to be shareholders in family farm 
corporations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     These are only two general examples of hybrid organizations.  There are numerous other ways to 
create such organizations, each with their own restrictions.  It is also important to remember that there are other 
requirements that need to be satisfied when applying for certification. Because each entity or ownership form has 
its own restrictions, it is impossible to make broad generalizations about compliance with the corporate farm law. 
 The best thing to do is to contact an attorney or the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, where situations 
can be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
