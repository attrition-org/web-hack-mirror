The Dairy and Food Inspection Division enforces state laws and regulations relating to dairy products, foods, meats, beverages, poultry and poultry products. Standards are enforced related to quality, condition, labeling, advertising and for the sanitation of premises, equipment and vehicles used in the sale, storage or distribution of food and beverages. It administers and enforces dairy laws and regulations designed to protect the general health and be of service to the dairy industries. This is accomplished through inspections, sampling and certification for both Grade A and manufacturing grade farms, plants and related facilities. Division personnel also investigate citizen complaints relating to questionable food products.
