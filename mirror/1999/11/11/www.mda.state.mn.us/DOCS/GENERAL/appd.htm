The Agronomy and Plant Protection Division conducts regulatory and informational efforts for pesticide, fertilizer, agricultural lime, seed, weed and feed. The division inspects and certifies grain shipments to foreign countries and other states as being pest free and inspects and certified nurseries. It also approves municipal mosquito control programs, and other pest control activities such as the gypsy moth and Japanese beetle programs. During the last decade, the division's emphasis has expanded to ensure that only necessary amounts of ag chemicals are used in order to protect the environment and public health. Requirements for the sale, use, storage and disposal of pesticides are enforced. In addition, commercial feed is monitored to ensure a safe food supply for livestock.</TD>
