<h1>USAAMA - U.S. Army Aeromedical Activity</h1>
</font><font COLOR="#000000">

<p>The United States Army Aeromedical Activity (USAAMA) is the tertiary central
aeromedical review authority for all Army aircrew members worldwide. Aerospace medicine
specialists make final recommendations for flying duty fitness to the Army personnel
system by review of flying duty medical examinations and aeromedical board summaries. The
activity director manages the Aeromedical Consultant Advisory Panel composed of aerospace
medicine specialists, flight surgeons board certified in other disciplines, and senior
Army aviators from the Fort Rucker area. Consultants develop and implement aeromedical
policy and standards, monitor the quality of aviation medicine care, educate and consult
with unit level flight surgeons, and study chronic disease and injury epidemiology in the
aircrew member population. Computer specialists maintain the Aviation Epidemiology Data
Register that archives history, physical, and aeromedical board information on aircrew
members and aircrew member training applicants.</p>

<p>Special notification:</b> Effective 12 August 1999, Class 1 (Warrant Officer) vision
standards are the same as Class 1A (Commissioned Officer). This is a temporary exception
to the regulation, AR 40-501, pending publication of the FY2000 version of AR 40-501. The
policy is not retroactive. Warrant Officer applicants who benefit from the change in
policy must submit a new flying duty medical examination with repeat eye examination. We
anticipate Class 1 and Class 1A will have the same vision standards in the next
publication of AR 40-501. However, in August 1999, the Aeromedical Consultant Advisory
Panel proposed modifications to combined Class 1/1A visual acuity and hyperopia standards.
OTSG is staffing the recommendations at this time.</p>
