the transition to year 2000 will be no different than the transition we experienced into

<p align="left"><font color="#00FF00"><strong><em>USAAMC established a Y2K committee in
January of 1998.&nbsp; The committee meets every third Thursday, V134, 0900.&nbsp; The
committee identified all Information Technology (IT) and Non-Information Technology &nbsp;
(Non IT) related items with computer embedded hospital wide ( computer systems, programs,
biomedical equipment and facility related items).&nbsp; All of these items were tested and
any noncompliant items were identified.&nbsp; Plans were created to replace or repair
these items to ensure they are ready for the millenium.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have brought the
list of over 15000 possible items down to less than 15.&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure operations
within the hospital are uninterrupted, all departments and divisions are currently working
on their contingency operation plans (COOP).&nbsp; These plans will be in place by 1 May
1999 .&nbsp;&nbsp; USAAMC&nbsp; will conduct an Y2K readiness exercise in MAY 99 to test
these COOPs and adjust as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong></font></p>
