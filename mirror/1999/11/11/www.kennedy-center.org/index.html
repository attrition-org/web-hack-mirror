furniture with an axe. Intrinsically good coder. Also a person
who<br>
manipulates and compromises security on other systems. Often
misused<br>
by media to the meaning of &quot;cracker&quot;, which is a lame
excuse for a life-form.</p>

<p>This is what happens when you hire and administrator that
doesnt know his head from his ass. I suggest you fire your
administrator. None of your files were harmed or viewed. </p>
