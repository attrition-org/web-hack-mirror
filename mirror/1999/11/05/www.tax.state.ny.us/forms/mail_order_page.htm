<p ALIGN="CENTER">Please read the following before placing your order:<font FACE="CG Times" SIZE="3"></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font><font SIZE="3">This service allows you to order most New York State
Department of Taxation and Finance tax forms and publications for delivery by conventional
mail. Please allow one to two weeks for delivery of your forms.<br>
<br>
You will be able to order up to five different forms from this service. You will receive
two copies of any form that you order and one copy of any publication. Instructions will
be included with your form orders.<br>
<br>
If you need to order a greater quantity of forms or order items not available through this
system call the appropriate number on our <a href="../nyshome/how_to_reach.htm"><u>How to
Reach Us</u></a> page.<br>
<br>
You will first be asked to enter your mailing address as well as your E-mail address
&nbsp; We need your E-mail address in case we have contact to you concerning your
order.&nbsp; You will then be asked to enter the tax year and the form number (e.g.,
IT-201) of the item you are requesting. If you do not know the form number, refer to the
descriptions of each form on our <u><a href="/forms/default.htm">Forms and Instructions</a></u>
or <a href="../pubs_and_bulls/index.html"><u>Publications and Technical Bulletins</u></a> pages. In
the event you cannot determine a form's number, we have included an area for you to
provide a description of the form. You should also use this area to describe the specific
period for forms that are filed more than once in a year (e.g., I need the quarterly sales
tax return for the period Sept. 1, 1998, through Nov. 30, 1998.)</p>
