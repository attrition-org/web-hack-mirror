SWEEPING OUTREACH INITIATIVE</big></font></blink></p>

<p>The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance is committed to improving
accessibility and service to all taxpayers.&nbsp; Toward that end, the Department has
created an Ethnic/Minority Outreach Project Team to identify, study and recommend ways to
remove barriers that prevent ethnic/minority taxpayers from obtaining the full range of
information and services provided by the agency.</p>

<p>Our Project Team, composed of employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences from
throughout the Department, is soliciting information and suggestions from taxpayers,
community groups, business and civic leaders and other concerned citizens throughout the
New York. </p>

<p>Our team members would be pleased to provide any additional information you may require
about this important project as well as hear your suggestions and comments.</p>

<p>We hope that you will consider contributing to this effort by helping to identify
issues of accessibility and service that may be particular to businesses and individuals
in your community. To participate, please contact the Team by clicking on the icon below.</p>

<p>By improving access and making dealing with the government easier for ethnic/minority
taxpayers, we will continue to make New York a better place in which all of our citizens
can live, work and do business.</p>
