<h1>New York State's Farmers' School Tax Credit</h1>

<p>In 1996, Governor George E. Pataki signed into law a new <strong>Farmers' Protection
and Farm Preservation Act</strong>, which helps to ensure that New York's farm families
remain a vital part of our State's economy. </p>

<p>This act included a<strong> Farmers' School Tax Credit </strong>which provides farmers
a significant state personal income and business tax credit for school property taxes paid
on farmland and buildings. In essence, the tax credit will exempt the first 250 acres of
farmland from school property taxes, by providing a tax credit to New York&#146;s farm
families up to 100 percent of the annual cost of their school property tax, a truly
historic measure. </p>
