<p>New York State Taxation and Finance Commissioner Arthur J. Roth and Brooklyn District
Attorney Charles J. Hynes today announced the arrest of a Brooklyn man on felony charges
in connection with a smuggling operation supplying untaxed cigarettes to restaurants in
the borough.</p>

<p>Jiuyan Liu, 45, of 770 58<sup>th</sup> Street, was charged Thursday with possession for
sale of untaxed cigarettes, attempting to evade and defeat the state cigarette tax and
tampering with evidence, after a search warrant was executed at his residence, culminating
a yearlong investigation.</p>

<p>The search turned up about 3,000 cartons of untaxed cigarettes, said Commissioner Roth
and District Attorney Hynes.</p>

<p>&quot;We consider this a significant arrest, cutting off one of the tentacles of the
cigarette smuggling hydra,&quot; said Commissioner Roth.&nbsp; &quot;Evading the cigarette
tax puts an unfair burden on legitimate business people who do pay their fair share of
taxes.&nbsp; Working with DA Hynes, we have been able to put an end to this
operation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This office takes the smuggling of cigarettes as seriously as we would any other
items of contraband,&quot; District Attorney Hynes said, &quot;particularly when they can
wind up in the hands of children.&quot;</p>

<p>The cigarettes had been transported to New York from Virginia and many of the cartons
had no tax stamp since they were purportedly destined to be sent overseas.&nbsp; Others
had a Virginia tax stamp, making them unsaleable in New York State.</p>

<p>Liu had already been arrested September 14th on a misdemeanor charge after he allegedly
sold untaxed cigarettes to a Brooklyn restaurant, said Commissioner Roth and District
Attorney Hynes.</p>

<p>The case was investigated by state Department of Taxation and Finance investigators and
will be prosecuted by the Brooklyn District Attorney&#146;s Office.&nbsp; The
investigation is continuing.</p>

<p>All charges are only allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent until
convicted in a court of law.</p>
