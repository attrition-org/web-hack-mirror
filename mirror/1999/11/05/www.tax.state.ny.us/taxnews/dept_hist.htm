<h2 align="center">A Brief History of the New York State Department of Taxation &amp;
Finance</h2>

<p>The New York State Department of Taxation &amp; Finance was formally established
January 1, 1927, but its roots trace back to the 1859 creation of a state Board of
Equalization of Assessments.&nbsp; The Board was charged with devising the formula for
distributing state tax revenue to individual counties, but not the collection of revenue.
&nbsp; The Board comprised the Commissioners of the Land Office and the state Board of
Assessors.</p>

<p>In 1896, the state Board of Tax Commissioners was formed.&nbsp; Its duties were still
the assessment and not the collection of taxes, but it could hear appeals on behalf of
local tax districts from the equalizations made by the county Board of Supervisors, and it
could revise these equalizations.</p>

<p>In 1915, the state Tax Department assumed all duties of the state Comptroller involving
corporation taxes, except for their collection.&nbsp; It was also given the authority to
order reassessment in any tax district where it suspected that the rolls were inaccurate
or inequitable.&nbsp; Assessments of the franchise tax on net income of business
corporations was also regulated by the Tax Department.</p>

<p>In 1921, the Tax Department was made responsible for the administration of the
inheritance, personal income and stock transfer taxes, and the collection of the
corporation franchise taxes.</p>

<p>In 1927, all the duties of the state Treasurer and Comptroller regarding collection of
taxes was transferred to the new Department of Taxation &amp; Finance.</p>

<p>Today, the Department of Taxation &amp; Finance is among the largest state revenue
collection agencies in the nation, responsible for the collection of over $34 billion in
revenues for state and local governments in state Fiscal Year 1998.</p>
