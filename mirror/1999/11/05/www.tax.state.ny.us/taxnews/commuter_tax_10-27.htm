<p>State Taxation and Finance Commissioner Arthur J. Roth today advised New York companies
to continue withholding New York City &quot;commuter tax&quot; payments for out-of-state
residents who work in New York City until the issue is finally resolved by the New York
State Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>Governor Pataki signed the legislation on May 27,1999 which eliminated the commuter tax
applied to 450,000 New York State residents who commute to work in New York City,
effective July 1, 1999.</p>

<p>&quot;Non-New York residents who commute to work in New York City will continue to be
subject to the non-resident earnings tax while New York residents will continue to benefit
from the repeal as long as this issue remains before the courts,&quot; Commissioner Roth
said.</p>

<p>More than 300,000 out-of-state commuters from all 49 other states, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico and more than a dozen foreign countries paid the New York City
non-resident tax in 1996.&nbsp; The tax rate is .45 percent of wages and .65 percent of
self-employment income.</p>

<p>Employers with questions about &quot;commuter tax&quot; withholding may obtain a copy
of the technical memo <a href="../pdf/memos/Income/m99_5i.pdf">TSB-M-99(5)(I),
&quot;Important Notice - Employer Reporting of New York City Wage&quot;</a> by contacting
the Tax Department at <nobr>(800) CALL TAX</nobr>, or on the Internet at <a href="../index.html">www.tax.state.ny.us</a>.</p>
