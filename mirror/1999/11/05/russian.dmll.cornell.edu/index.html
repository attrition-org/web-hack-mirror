                    GROZNY, Russia (CNN) -- Two local Red Cross workers were among at<BR>
                  least 25 people killed Friday when a Russian air attack struck a refugee<BR>
                  convoy in Chechnya, the international relief organization said Saturday. <BR><BR>

                  The Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross said another<BR>
                  70 people -- including a Red Cross worker -- were injured when a Russian<BR>
                  rocket hit the convoy. <BR><BR>

                  Russian commanders strongly denied that they are attacking civilians in<BR>
                  convoys or in their homes. They said warplanes had attacked a column of<BR>
                  trucks carrying Chechen fighters. <BR><BR>

                  Chechen officials had said Friday that at least 50 refugees were killed. The<BR>
                  ICRC said the refugee convoy had been hit west of Grozny despite the fact<BR>
                  at least five cars carried distinctive Red Cross emblems. <BR><BR><BR>
