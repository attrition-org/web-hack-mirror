<p>The Pension Search Program, created by the Retirement Protection Act of 1994, 
  locates people owed benefits from fully funded, PBGC-insured defined benefit 
  pension plans that end. This builds on PBGC's successful efforts to locate people 
  missing in underfunded pension plans taken over by PBGC after they ended without 
  enough money to pay benefits. President Clinton has submitted proposed legislation 
  to the Congress that would further expand the program to include defined contribution 
  plans, such as 401(k) plans, and multiemployer defined benefit plans. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: Employers choosing to end fully funded pension 
  plans must distribute all plan benefits to workers and retirees before completely 
  ending the plan. If someone cannot be found, the plan administrator either purchases 
  an annuity from a private insurer in that person's name or deposits funds in 
  a financial institution, such as a bank. Companies often have had difficulty 
  finding an insurance company or financial institution willing to accept the 
  funds on behalf of a missing person and the people who have been missed often 
  have had no idea where to look for their benefits. Now, companies and their 
  workers can turn to PBGC's Pension Search Program. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
<p><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong>: The program to locate people missing from fully 
  funded plans generally applies to people whose pension money is distributed 
  on or after January 1, 1996. Before turning to PBGC, the administrator of a 
  fully funded pension plan must make a diligent effort, including the use of 
  a locator service, to find a former worker due a pension.<br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
<p>The plan will provide PBGC with information on the missing person and the benefit 
  owed, including the starting date and any named beneficiary. Plan administrators 
  determine the pension amount to be sent to PBGC for the missing person based 
  on the terms of their plan and on PBGC regulations. A company may instead choose 
  to purchase an annuity for the person and give PBGC information identifying 
  the missing person and the insurance company. The plan administrator gives information 
  and any payment to PBGC with the post-distribution form that tells PBGC that 
  the plan has satisfied benefit promises to all workers and retirees. Once a 
  missing person or beneficiary is found, PBGC will pay the pension benefit or 
  tell that person which insurance company has the annuity.<br><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>INTERNET PENSION SEARCH DIRECTORY</strong>: PBGC has found many of 
  the missing people owed pensions both from fully funded plans that have ended 
  and from underfunded plans taken over by PBGC, but some people still cannot 
  be found. To aid its search effort, PBGC developed the Internet Pension Search 
  (<a href="index.html"><b>http://search.pbgc.gov</b></a>) that lists 
  names and last-known addresses, companies where missing people earned their 
  pensions, and the dates their pension plans ended. The Internet Pension Search 
  is updated periodically and a number of organizations are partners helping the 
  pension search. Additional search tips are outlined in PBGC's guidebook, <b><a href="http://www.pbgc.gov/lostpendl.htm">Finding 
  A Lost Pension</a></b>, available on the Interent and also from PBGC's Communications 
  and Public Affairs Department, 1200 K Street NW, Suite 240, Washington, DC 20005-4026. 
  <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
<p><strong>WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD DO</strong>: People who believe that a pension plan 
  owes them a benefit and they may be missing from the plan records should first 
  try to contact the pension plan administrator or the company where they earned 
  their pension. If the company cannot be found, they can contact PBGC by sending 
  an Internet e-mail message to <a href="mailto:missing@pbgc.gov"><b>missing@pbgc.gov</b></a> 
  or by writing to the PBGC Pension Search Program, 1200 K Street NW, Suite 930, 
  Washington,D.C. 20005-4026.<br>
  <br wp="br2">

<p>The person should provide name, address, day-time telephone number, Social 
  Security number, date of birth, the name and location of the employer, and, 
  if possible, the dates of employment, the name of the pension plan, the nine-digit 
  Employer Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit Plan Number (PN). <br><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>TO AVOID BECOMING A MISSING PARTICIPANT:</strong> Workers should inform 
  their companies when they move and they should keep any information given to 
  them about their pension benefits and the pension plan. Especially helpful is 
  the plan's name, nine-digit employer identification number (EIN) and three-digit 
  plan number (PN), and the name and address of the plan administrator or other 
  plan representative. <br wp="br1">
