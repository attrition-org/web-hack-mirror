<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC) has been working on Year 2000 project tasks since 1996.  The project is coordinated by Jay Webster, 
Director of Information Resources Department (IRD), and is part of the Year 2000 project for the State of Texas.  The goal of the project is to assure continuity of 
mission critical services before, during, and after the crossover to the year 2000.
<BR><BR>
The project plan encompasses information technology systems, embedded systems in facilities and utilities, trading partners/supply chains, and electronic interfaces.  
All departmental units within the TABC participate in the project and have been involved in awareness, risk assessment, inventory, remediation, testing,
implementation, and contingency/continuity planning phases of the project.
<BR><BR>
In January 1997 the TABC suspended all program enhancements in order to concentrate on Year 2000 issues.  The following is a high level summary of activities involved in addressing the Year 2000 concerns:<UL>
<LI>All files containing date fields were identified.
<LI>All files containing date fields were reorganized so that they could accept a 4-digit year.
<LI>All programs containing date fields and date functions were identified.
<LI>Conversion time estimates were made for the conversion process.
<LI>Staff assignments were made by application system.
<LI>Progress made on each individual program was tracked.
<LI>IRD worked with Department of Information Resources to comply with all requirements.
<LI>Conversion programs were written for each file.
<LI>Conversion steps were tested and timed.</UL>
Remediation, testing, and implementation into production of mission critical systems which support the Licensing, Compliance, and Enforcement functions within the agency was completed in May, 1997.  All personal computer hardware and software have been tested and designated as compliant.  Business continuity and contingency planning will be completed by September, 1999.
