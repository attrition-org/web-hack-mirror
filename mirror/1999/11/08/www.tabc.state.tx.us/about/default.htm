	<TD COLSPAN="2"><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The 21st Amendment, which signalled repeal of national prohibition in the 1930's, plainly gives each individual state the ability to control the importation and use of alcoholic beverages within its boundaries.  This is probably the only remaining right guaranteed more or less exclusively to the states, and the courts have generally approached litigated issues from the position of "presumed state authority" when deciding on important regulatory issues.<P>The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code is a comprehensive set of laws refined over the years by the various legislatures which have addressed the issues of the day.  The code strongly asserts itself on the issues which gave rise to prohibition and protects against involvement of the criminal element in beverage alcohol trafficking.  The legislature has very strictly prohibited persons who have been convicted of certain crimes from obtaining licenses or permits.  Also prohibited is "tied house" violations where ownership overlaps the three marketing levels (manufacturing, wholesaling and retailing) in the beverage alcohol industry.<P>Through a system of reviewing all shipments of alcoholic beverages into Texas, coupled with a review of transfer of merchandise between wholesalers, the separation of levels is scrutinized closely.  Background investigations and other research is undertaken during the process which occurs when a person applies for a permit or license to operate in some phase of the industry.  In this way, ownership by others involved at different levels can be detected, as well as those factors which would tend to disqualify an applicant on account of previous criminal history or indebtedness to the state for taxes.<P><P><IMG SRC="../images/video.gif" ALT="Video File - Real Audio" WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=11 BORDER=0> <A HREF="../../video/whoweare.ram">Who We Are, What We Do</A><FONT SIZE=1> &nbsp; Video Length: 7 minutes 03 seconds</FONT>
