<font size="2">
<p>The Municipal Research &amp; Services Center (MRSC) is pleased to announce the start of services to Washington counties on July 1, 1997.  MRSC is a non-profit, independent organization created in 1969 to continue programs established in 1934 under the Bureau of Governmental Research at the University of Washington.  Our mission is &quot;working together for excellence in local government through professional consultation, research and information services.&quot;  
<p>The Center is governed by a volunteer board of directors drawn from local government and the community-at-large.  MRSC does not engage in political activity.   We do work in cooperation with the Association of Washington Cities and the Washington State Association of Counties, advocacy organizations for cities and counties.
<p>Individual cities and counties pay no fees for the Center's programs.  Instead, programs are cooperatively funded out of a small portion of the cities' Motor Vehicle Excise Tax and the counties&#146; distribution of the Liquor Excise tax.  Funding is provided through a biennial contract with the Municipal Research Council, a state agency.  The Council has 23 members:  four appointed by the President of the Senate; four appointed by the Speaker of the House; one appointed by the Governor; nine members appointed by the Association of Washington Cities, three appointed by the Washington State Association of Counties, and two appointed by the Washington Association of County Officials. 
<p><b>Services</b>
<p>Programs and services are available to Washington&#146;s 275 cites and 39 counties.  MRSC's resources include a professional staff who are local government experts, a comprehensive local government reference library, publications, and an information packed site on the World Wide Web.
<p>One of the principal services of the Municipal Research &amp; Services Center (MRSC) is to respond to <b>inquiries</b> on virtually every facet of local government.  Staff experience includes budgeting and finance, municipal law, public management and administration, planning and growth management, public works and utilities, and local government policies.
<p>Local officials may request assistance by phone, letter, fax, or e-mail.  Our toll-free number is 1-800-933-6772 for long distance calls.  Our fax number is (206) 625-1220.  Our e-mail address is <a href="mailto:mrsc@mrsc.org"><b>mrsc@mrsc.org.</b></a> Telephone inquiry service is available from 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.   If a consultant is not immediately available, you can record a detailed request on voice mail 24-hours a day, and a staff member will call back as soon as possible.
<p>MRSC's <a href="http://www.mrsc.org/library/libpage.htm"><b>library</b></a> contains the state's largest collection of local government reference materials, with over 12,000 volumes.  Available materials include local ordinances, city and county codes, budgets and financial reports, comprehensive plans and documents illustrating virtually every function and operation of local government.  City and county officials are encouraged to send copies of local documents so that they can be shared with other local governments.
<p>You can  access MRSC&#146;s <b>Web site</b> at <a href="http://www.mrsc.org"><b>http://www.mrsc.org.</b></a>  This information-packed site includes the Revised Code of Washington, Washington Administrative Code, municipal and county codes,ordinances, and a wealth of information relevant to local governments in Washington State. 
<p>MRSC produces comprehensive <a href="http://www.mrsc.org/mrscpubs.htm"><b>publications</b></a> to share municipal research.   Contact us if  you would like a listing of available publications.  We also work with elected officials and staff of cities and towns to develop professional <b>training opportunities</b>.
<p>MRSC programs belong to Washington cities and counties.  We appreciate any comments or suggestions to improve our services.
