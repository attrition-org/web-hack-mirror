The County Road Administration Board manages two grant programs to meet changing needs of counties. The programs are administered with maximum flexibility and minimum overhead.
<h3>Rural Arterial Program (RAP)</h3>
In 1983 the legislature created the RAP to help finance the reconstruction of rural arterial roads in the wake of railroad abandonments. In recognition of its success, the program's initial funding of 0.33 cents of the Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax (MVFT) was 
increased to 0.58 cents by the 1990 legislature. That level of funding generates approximately $37 million per biennium, of which less than two percent is spent for administration.

<h3>County Arterial Preservation Program (CAPP)</h3>
In 1990 the legislature created a second grant program to be administered by CRAB. Similar to the Department of Transportation's Highway Preservation program, CAPP is designed to assist counties to preserve their existing paved arterial road networks. The
program is funded with 0.45 cent of the fuel tax which generates approximately $26 million per biennium. Less than two percent of the revenue is spent for administration.
