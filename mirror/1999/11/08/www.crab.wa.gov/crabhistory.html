The County Road Administration Board (CRAB) was created by the
Legislature in 1965 to provide statutory oversight of <a HREF="counties/index.html">Washington's
thirty-nine county road departments</a>. The agency is funded from
the portion of the counties' fuel tax that is withheld for state
supervision, and from a small portion of the <a HREF="grants/index.html">two grant programs</a>
that it administers. The agency is governed by a nine member <a href="CRABoard/index.html">board</a> 
which meets quarterly and is comprised of six county commissioners/council-members
and three county engineers. The Board is appointed by the Board
of Directors of the Washington State Association of Counties.
The Board establishes and maintains &quot;Standards of Good Practice&quot;
to guide and ensure consistency and professional management of
county road departments in the state of Washington. The agency
is a major resource for the <a HREF="/wsace.html">Washington Association of County Engineers</a>
and the Washington State Association of Counties
for transportation related issues. CRAB does research, provides
reports and presents testimony when appropriate. The responsibility
to distribute the counties' portion of the Motor Vehicle Fuel
Tax (MVFT) was given to CRAB in 1985. At that time the agency
also became the custodian of the county road log, a database of
over 40,000 miles of roads. The formula for the distribution of
fuel tax revenues is updated biennially to reflect statewide changes
in population, costs, and mileage.
