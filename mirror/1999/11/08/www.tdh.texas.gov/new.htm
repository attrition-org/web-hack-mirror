      <li><a href="otpc/index.html">The Office of Tobacco Prevention and Control (OTPC)</a> provides a
        clearinghouse of information on tobacco use prevention issues. Technical assistance is
        available to community organizations, schools, worksites, health professionals and law
        enforcement agencies on the development and implementation of tobacco use prevention
        policies, including strategies to increase public awareness and reduce tobacco sales to
        youth. OTPC is currently conducting a campaign to educate youth about the tobacco law
        which makes it illegal for minors to purchase or have possession of tobacco. Penalties for
        a minor (under 18) in possession of tobacco can include one or more of the following: a
        $250 fine, suspension of their driver's license, participation in an approved tobacco
        education class and community service. To learn more about the law and tobacco use by
        minors, visit <a href="http://www.dontgetburned.com/">www.dontgetburned.com</a>. </li>
