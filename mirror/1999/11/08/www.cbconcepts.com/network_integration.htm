    part of every organization. You can be insured that your new network will operate smoothly
    because we help you select compatible networking system components from today's leading
    manufacturers. To assure successful transitions, our certified lab technicians perform the
    following:</font></small><ul>
      <li><small><font face="Arial">Test and configure your systems subsequent to installation</font></small></li>
      <li><small><font face="Arial">Verify that system components operate effectively and to
        specification, separately and when integrated, before installing the system at any site</font></small></li>
      <li><small><font face="Arial">Communicate with on-site staff during the installation process
        so that day-to-day operation and maintenance issues can be handled appropriately, with
        minimum interruption </font></small></li>
    </ul>
