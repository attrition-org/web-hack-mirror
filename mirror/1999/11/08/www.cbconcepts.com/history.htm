    <td width="100%"><small><font face="Arial">Creative Business Concepts, Inc. was
    established in 1986 as a LAN sales and support organization. I believed then, and still do
    today, that no matter how good a company is at providing networking technology, there is
    always room for improvement. Therefore, we set out to find the most highly qualified and
    skilled technical, sales and support personnel in the business.</font></small><p><font face="Arial"><small>The end result of those two theories has brought numerous awards to
    Creative Business Concepts, Inc. which can be found under the <a href="history.htm#Awards" target="_self">Awards</a> section of our web site. Some of our
    more prominent awards consist of our listing in the <em>INC 500</em> in 1996, along with
    many years of listings in the <em>Local Area Network Top 100 Integrators</em> in the
    county.&nbsp; These awards let us know what we are capable of on a regular basis and
    continually challenge us to improve each and every day.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Today, Creative Business Concepts, Inc. has expanded into
    many new areas of Local Area Networking services and support. For years, we have been
    involved with LAN design, WAN design, host and remote connectivity, network security, and
    mass storage subsystems primarily running on Microsoft NT and Novell operating systems.
    Over the past couple of years, we have expanded into high level consulting services.
    &nbsp; These services are provided by only senior level engineers, in a written form, to
    assist you with design, planning, implementation, time lines and strategies on building a
    platform within your organization for the future.&nbsp; These services can include network
    management, email and intranet; corporate email communications access and many more.&nbsp;
    We have also become experts with the Microsoft BackOffice Suite of products and have
    achieved the Microsoft Solution Provider Partner level status.</small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">The difference when working with CBC is evident in the
    quality of our personnel and the longevity of our staff.&nbsp; Twenty-five percent of our
    organization has been with the company between 5 and 13 years.&nbsp; Our engineering staff
    is second to none, with nearly 100% of our staff being cross-certified as both Microsoft
    MCSEs <em>and</em> Novell CNEs.&nbsp; These two factors provide you, the customer, with
    consistency of service and support in a formula for building a tremendous long term
    relationship.&nbsp; The current list of Fortune 500 companies doing business with CBC
    exemplifies this type of successful relationship.&nbsp; <small><small>(References
    available upon request.)</small></small></font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>CBC has continued to grow over the past year and a half to
    include a Microsoft CTEC (Certified Technical Education Center).&nbsp; This state of the
    art training facility, along with a superior training staff, has allowed us to provide
    MCSE certification tracks as well as the Microsoft BackOffice Suite of applications
    classes, conducted at CBC or your own facility.&nbsp; We have also designed customized
    training packages, including courseware and &quot;turnkey&quot; training solutions for
    your entire organization.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>The other area of growth has been to satisfy many of our
    clients' needs with temporary staffing or contract labor, or to provide permanent
    placement of IS personnel.&nbsp; Our dedicated Recruiting department will define the scope
    of candidate and professionally interview the candidates with our highly technical
    management staff.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>These new challenges are areas where Creative Business
    Concepts, Inc. will help take you and your company into the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.&nbsp;
    The past was great, but the future will be greater. Let Creative Business Concepts, Inc.
    help your company in formulating an information technology design and implementation plan
    that will assist your organization in being a top performer in your field in the years to
    come.</small></font></p>
