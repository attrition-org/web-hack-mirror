    <p>(a) Prior to being issued decals or insignia, each manufacturing facility will undergo
    a certification inspection. The plant certification will be conducted by a department team
    normally consisting of an engineer and one or more department inspectors or, when
    designated by the department, third party inspectors. The inspection shall be conducted in
    accordance with the procedures established by the Texas Industrialized Building Code
    Council. The purpose of the plant certification inspection will be to assure that the
    compliance control program in themanufacturing facility is capable of producing structures
    in compliance with the approved design package. The team will become familiar with all
    aspects of the manufacturer's approved design package. Structures on the production line
    will be checked to assure that failures to conform located by the inspection team are
    being located by the plant compliance control program and are being corrected by the plant
    personnel. The inspection team will work closely with the plant compliance control
    personnel to assure that the approved design package and compliance control manuals for
    the facility are clearly understood and are being followed. If deemed necessary by the
    certification inspection team, a representative of the design review agency must be
    present during the inspection. The plant certification inspection will terminate when the
    inspection team has fully evaluated all aspects of the manufacturing facility. At least
    one module or modular component containing all systems, or a combination of modules or
    modular components containing all systems, shall be observed during all phases of
    construction. The team must inspect all modules or modular components in the production
    line during the certification.</p>
    <p>(b) Following completion of the plant certification inspection, the team will issue a
    plant certification report. The manufacturer must keep a copy of this report in their
    permanent records. The plant certification report will contain:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) the name and address of the manufacturer;</p>
      <p>(2) the names and titles of personnel performing the certification inspection;</p>

      (with appropriate design package references) and corrective action taken in each case;</p>
      <p>(5) a list of deviations from the approved compliance control procedures (with section
      or manual references) observed during the certification inspection with the corrective
      action taken in each case;</p>
      <p>(6) the date of certification;</p>
      <p>(7) the following statement: &quot;This report concludes that (name of agency), after
      evaluating the facility, certifies that (name of factory) of (city) is capable of

    <p>(a) The TPIA/TPI shall conduct announced and unannounced inspections at the
    manufacturing facility at reasonable, but varying, intervals to review any and all aspects
    of the manufacturer's production and compliance control program. The TPIA/TPI shall
    conduct inspections in accordance with procedures established by the Texas Industrialized
    Building Code Council. In order to determine if the compliance control program is working
    as set forth in the compliance control manual, inspection of every visible aspect of every
    module shall normally be made at least at one point prior to completion of the structural,
    plumbing, mechanical, or electrical phase. Inspection of system testing shall be made at
    least once every third inspection. It is the manufacturer's responsibility to assure that
    the inspections are accomplished as outlined in this subsection. The department will
    determine the frequency of modular component inspections.</p>
    <p>(b) Inspections at the manufacturing facility shall be increased in frequency as
    necessary to assure that the manufacturer is performing in accordance with the approved
    compliance control manual.</p>
    <p>(c) The commissioner, at his discretion, may require, or may authorize upon written
    request by the manufacturer, the use of council approved third party inspectors to perform
    in-plant inspections. The manufacturer must designate in writing the third party
    inspection agency that will be performing in-plant inspections. A manufacturer may
    designate more than one third party inspection agency to perform in-plant inspections.
    However, once an agency has begun the in-plant inspection on the modules for a project or
    building, the manufacturer may not change inspection agencies for that project or
    building. Third party inspection agencies must provide the department a written schedule
    of inspections a minimum of seven days prior to the inspection. If the inspection must be
    rescheduled for any reason, the TPIA must immediately inform the department of the
    schedule change. If an approved third party inspector is utilized, fees may be paid
    directly to the third party inspector.</p>
    <p>(d) The department shall monitor and evaluate the performance of third party inspectors
    and design review agencies and make performance reports and recommendations to the council
    as may be necessary.</p>
    <p>(e) The manufacturer shall reimburse the department an hourly monitoring fee for
    expenses incurred outside headquarters in monitoring the performance of the third party
    inspection agency.</p>
    <p>(f) The TPI shall furnish the manufacturer a copy of the inspection report upon
    completion of the in-plant inspection. The report must be kept in the manufacturer's file
    at least five years.</p>

    <p>When the building site is within a municipality which has a building inspection agency
    or department, the local building official will inspect all on-site construction and the
    attachment of the structure to the permanent foundation to assure completion and
    attachment in accordance with the approved design package and any unique foundation system
    or on-site details. As a minimum the local building official shall:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) perform an overall visual inspection for obvious nonconformity to the applicable
      code, require final inspections along with any tests which are required by the approved
      installation instructions, on-site construction documentation, and/or the applicable code,
      and require the correction of deficiencies identified by the tests or discovered in final
      inspections;</p>
      <p>(2) notify the commissioner of any damage to a module or modular component resulting
      from transportation to, or handling at, the building site which is not corrected by the
      industrialized builder; notify the commissioner of any noncompliance to, or deviation
      from, the approved building system or applicable code; and report to the commissioner any
      violation of these rules and regulations. These notices and reports shall be submitted by
      certified mail.</p>

    <p>(a) The council shall resolve any dispute, disagreement, or difference of opinion
    between the design review agency (or department when acting as a design review agency) and
    a local building official as to whether the approved design package meets or exceeds the
    requirements of the mandatory building codes set forth in this chapter. The council's
    decision shall be timely made and shall be binding on all parties.</p>
    <p>(b) If the local building official thinks the approved design package or unique on-site
    construction documentation does not meet the code requirements of this chapter, this
    opinion shall be forwarded in writing to the commissioner at the department's Austin
    office within seven working days following the filing of an application for a building
    permit and prior to issuance of the building permit. This written opinion shall set forth
    specifically those code sections for which the noncompliance allegedly exists and the
    specific reasons the local building official thinks the design package or unique on-site
    construction documentation fails to meet the code requirements. The local building
    official shall submit 15 copies of the written opinion. The commissioner will submit the
    local building official's opinion and reasons to the council within three working days
    following receipt. The council shall determine at the next scheduled meeting, not to
    exceed 45 days, whether or not the design package or unique on-site construction
    documentation meets the mandatory state code requirements and shall notify the local
    building official and the commissioner in writing. If the design package or on-site
    construction documentation is determined by the council to meet the code requirements, the
    local building official shall issue a building permit. Questions concerning the code
    compliance of a design package or on-site construction documentation must be raised prior
    to the issuance of a building permit and, once a local building permit is issued, the
    local building official shall not stop any on-site construction due to questions about the
    approved design package or on-site construction documentation.</p>
    <p>(c) If a dispute or difference of opinion arises between the manufacturer and the third
    party inspector during an in-plant inspection as to whether the construction meets or
    exceeds the approved design package, the dispute or differences shall be resolved by the
    commissioner. If the commissioner is unable to resolve the dispute, then he will forward
    it to the council for resolution.</p>
    <p>(d) If a dispute or difference of opinion arises between the industrialized builder and
    a local building official or third party inspector as to whether the on-site construction
    meets or exceeds the approved design package or unique on-site construction documentation,
    the dispute or difference of opinion shall be resolved by the commissioner. If the
    commissioner is unable to resolve the dispute, then he will forward it to the council for
    resolution.</p>

    <p>(a) If the commissioner finds that the standards prescribed by the statute or rules and
    regulations of another state meet the objectives of Texas Civil Statutes, Article 5221f-1
    and are satisfactorily enforced by that state or its agents, then the commissioner may
    enter a reciprocal agreement with that state to authorize building inspections of
    industrialized houses or buildings constructed in that state to be performed by an
    inspector of the equivalent regulatory agency of that state. The standards of another
    state shall not be deemed to be adequately enforced unless the other state provides for
    immediate written notification to the commissioner of suspensions or revocations of
    approvals of manufacturers by the other state.</p>
    <p>(b) If the commissioner enters a reciprocity agreement with another state, then the
    commissioner will accept industrialized housing and buildings which have been inspected by
    the reciprocal state and which have the appropriate decal, label, or insignia of the
    reciprocal state. Manufacturers in the reciprocal state who construct industrialized
    housing and buildings for Texas will be subject to the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) Manufacturers must be registered in Texas in accordance with <a HREF="#70.20">Section
      70.20</a> of this title (relating to the Registration of Manufacturers and Industrialized
      Builders). The manufacturer must submit evidence that its building system and compliance
      control program have been approved by the reciprocal state. The commissioner shall verify
      the approval and maintain a list of manufacturers approved under the terms of the
      reciprocity agreement.</p>
      <p>(2) Industrialized housing, buildings, modules, and modular components will be
      constructed in accordance with the codes referenced in <a HREF="ihbrule2.htm#70.100">Section
      70.100</a> of this title (relating to Mandatory State Codes) and any amendments to those
      codes in accordance with <a HREF="ihbrule2.htm#70.101">Section 70.101</a> of this title
      (relating to Amendments to Mandatory State Codes). The code used will be determined in
      accordance with <a HREF="ihbrule2.htm#70.102">Section 70.102</a> of this title (relating
      to Use and Construction of Codes).</p>
      <p>(3) Review and approval of the manufacturer's design package will be in accordance with
      <a HREF="ihbrule2.htm#70.70">Section 70.70</a> of this title (relating to Responsibilities
      of the Registrants -Manufacturer's Design Package), except that the reciprocity agreement
      with the reciprocal state will accept the compliance control program approved by the
      reciprocal state for that manufacturer. All inspections performed by the reciprocal state
      must be in accordance with documents reviewed and approved by a council approved design
      review agency or the department when acting as a design review agency.</p>
      <p>(4) The manufacturer will assign a Texas decal or insignia to each module or modular
      component for Texas in accordance with <a HREF="ihbrule2.htm#70.77">Section 70.77</a> of
      this title (relating to Responsibilities of the Registrants - Decals and Insignia). The
      Texas decal or insignia will be placed in the vicinity of the decal, label, or insignia of
      the reciprocal state.</p>
      <p>(5) The manufacturer will permanently attach a data plate to each industrialized house
      or building in accordance with <a HREF="ihbrule2.htm#70.71">Section 70.71</a> of this
      title (relating to the Responsibilities of the Registrants - Manufacturer's Data Plate).</p>
      <p>(6) The manufacturer will submit a monthly report to the commissioner in accordance
      with <a HREF="#70.50">Section 70.50</a> of this title (relating to Manufacturer and
      Builder Monthly Reports).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(c) If the commissioner determines that the standards for the manufacture and
    inspection of industrialized housing and buildings in a reciprocal state, with which the
    commissioner has entered a reciprocal agreement, do not meet the objectives of Texas Civil
    Statutes, Article 5221f-1 or are not being enforced by the reciprocal state, then the
    commissioner shall suspend or revoke the reciprocal agreement. The reciprocal state and
    affected manufacturers will receive written notification of the reasons for the suspension
    or revocation of the agreement.</p>
    <p>(d) Written notification of suspension or revocation of a manufacturer by another state
    with which the commissioner has entered a reciprocal agreement will be cause to suspend
    orrevoke the approval of that manufacturer to construct industrialized housing and
    buildings for Texas.</p>
