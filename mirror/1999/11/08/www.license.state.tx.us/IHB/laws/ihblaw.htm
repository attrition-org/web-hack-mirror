    <p>In this article:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) &quot;<b>Industrialized housing</b>&quot; means a residential structure that is
      designed for the use and occupancy of one or more families, that is constructed in one or
      more modules or constructed using one or more modular components built at a location other
      than the permanent residential site, and that is designed to be used as a permanent
      residential structure when the modules or modular components are transported to the
      permanent residential site and are erected or installed on a permanent foundation system.
      The term includes the plumbing, heating, air-conditioning, and electrical systems. The
      term does not include any residential structure that is in excess of three stories or 49
      feet in height as measured from the finished grade elevation at the building entrance to
      the peak of the roof. The term shall not mean nor apply to (i) housing constructed of
      sectional or panelized systems not utilizing modular components; or (ii) any ready-built
      home which is constructed so that the entire living area is contained in a single unit or
      section at a temporary location for the purpose of selling it and moving it to another
      location.</p>
      <p>(2) &quot;<b>Industrialized building</b>&quot; means a commercial structure that is
      constructed in one or more modules or constructed using one or more modular components
      built at a location other than the permanent commercial site, and that is designed to be
      used as a commercial building when the modules or modular components are transported to
      the permanent commercial site and are erected or installed on a permanent foundation
      system. The term includes the plumbing, heating, air-conditioning, and electrical systems.
      The term does not include any commercial structure that is in excess of three stories or
      49 feet in height as measured from the finished grade elevation at the building entrance
      to the peak of the roof.</p>
      <p>(3) &quot;<b>Council</b>&quot; means the Texas Industrialized Building Code Council.</p>
      <p>(4) &quot;<b>Department</b>&quot; means the Texas Department of Licensing and
      Regulation.</p>
      <p>(5) &quot;<b>Commissioner</b>&quot; means the Commissioner of the Texas Department of
      Licensing and Regulation.</p>
      <p>(6) &quot;<b>Modular component</b>&quot; means a structural portion of any dwelling or
      building that is constructed at a location other than the homesite in such a manner that
      its construction cannot be adequately inspected for code compliance at a homesite without
      damage or without removal of a part thereof and reconstruction.</p>
      <p>(7) &quot;<b>Commission</b>&quot; means the Texas Commission of Licensing and
      Regulation.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p></a><a NAME="section2"><b>Section 2. BUILDING CODES.</b></p>
    <p>(a) Industrialized housing and industrialized buildings must be constructed to meet or
    exceed the requirements and standards of the National Electrical Code as published by the
    National Fire Protection Association and as it existed on January 1, 1985, and the
    requirements and standards of whichever of the following two groups of codes is used by
    the municipality in which the housing or building is erected or installed:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Plumbing Code, and Uniform Mechanical Code, as
      published by the International Conference of Building Officials and as those codes existed
      on January 1, 1985; or</p>
      <p>(2) The Standard Building Code, Standard Mechanical Code, Standard Plumbing Code, and
      Standard Gas Code, as published by the Southern Building Code Congress International,
      Inc., and as those codes existed on January 1, 1985.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(b) If the industrialized housing or building is erected or installed outside a
    municipality or if the municipality in which the industrialized housing or building is
    erected or installed does not use either of the two groups of codes listed by subsection
    (a) of this section, the housing or building must be constructed to meet or exceed the
    requirements and standards of whichever of those two groups the manufacturer shall choose.</p>
    <p>(c) If a code identified by subsection (a) of this section is revised after January 1,
    1985, the requirements and the standards of the revised code are to be used in place of
    the January 1, 1985, edition if the council determines that the revision is in the public
    interest and consistent with the purposes of this article.</p>
    <p>(d) All areas of authority belonging to municipalities are specifically and entirely
    reserved to them. That authority may include local land use and zoning requirements,
    building setback requirements, side and rear yard requirements, site planning and
    development and property line requirements, subdivision control, and landscape
    architectural requirements. Those local requirements and regulations and others not in
    conflict with this article or other state law relating to transportation, erection, or
    installation, or use, shall be reasonably and uniformly applied and enforced without
    distinctions as to whether the housing or buildings are manufactured or are constructed on
    site. A municipality that regulates on-site construction or installation specifically has
    authority to:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) require and review, for compliance with the mandatory state codes, a complete set
      of design plans and specifications bearing the stamp of the council for each installation
      within its corporate limits;</p>
      <p>(2) require that all applicable local permits and licenses be obtained before any
      construction begins on a building site;</p>
      <p>(3) require that all modules or modular components bear an approved decal or insignia
      under rules of the department reflecting that they have been inspected at the
      manufacturing plant or facility; and</p>
      <p>(4) establish procedures for the inspection of the erection and installation of any
      industrialized housing or buildings to be located within its corporate limits to assure
      compliance with the mandatory codes and the rules of the commissioner and for the
      inspection of all foundation and other on-site construction to assure compliance with
      approved designs, plans, and specifications; these procedures may require final
      inspections and tests before occupancy in accordance with the mandatory codes and may
      require correction of deficiencies identified by the tests or discovered in final
      inspections.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(e) A municipality, or other local political subdivision, may not require or enforce
    any amendments to the model codes set forth in subsection (a) of this section as a
    prerequisite for granting or approving any local building or construction permits or
    certificates of occupancy.</p>
    <p></a><a NAME="section3"><b>Section 3. DESIGN APPROVAL.</b></p>
    <p>The department or approved design review agency shall review all designs, plans, and
    specifications of industrialized housing or buildings in accordance with the
    interpretations and instructions of the council to assure compliance with the mandatory
    state codes and shall cause the stamp of approval of the council to be placed on all pages
    of the designs, plans, and specifications that meet or exceed the code standards and
    requirements.</p>
    <p></a><a NAME="section4"><b>Section 4. BUILDING INSPECTIONS.</b></p>
    <p>(a) The department shall inspect the construction of industrialized housing or
    buildings at the manufacturing plant or facility to assure compliance with the approved
    designs, plans, and specifications. Instead of using department personnel for in-plant
    inspections, the commissioner may designate third-party inspectors approved by the council
    to perform these inspections subject to rules of the commissioner. Local building
    officials shall be permitted to witness in-plant inspections in order to make
    recommendations for inspection procedures to the council.</p>
    <p>(b) The construction of the foundation system and the erection and installation of the
    modules or modular components on the permanent foundation to assure compliance with the
    designs, plans, and specifications for industrialized housing or buildings to be sited
    within the corporate limits of a city shall be inspected by the city building official
    along with all construction done at the permanent site location. If the industrialized
    housing or building is to be located outside the corporate limits of any city, the on-site
    inspections shallbe performed by third party inspectors approved by the council or by the
    commissioner.</p>
    <p>(c) The commissioner, by rule, may authorize a building inspection of industrialized
    housing or buildings constructed in another state to be performed by an inspector of the
    equivalent regulatory agency of the other state and also may authorize the performance of
    inspections of industrialized housing or buildings that are constructed in this state for
    use in another state. The commissioner must enter a reciprocity agreement with the agency
    of the other state as necessary to implement this section.</p>
    <p></a><a NAME="section5"><b>Section 5. COUNCIL CREATED.</b></p>
