    industry and to impose a gross receipts tax upon the proceeds obtained from boxing
    performances to finance said regulation. The legislature finds this to be the most
    economical and efficient means of dealing with this problem and serving the public
    interest. Accordingly, this Act shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its
    underlying policies and purposes.</p>
