    <p>(a) Before each bout, the referee shall call the contestants and their chief seconds
    together for final instructions. The referee shall hold the chief second responsible for
    his contestant's conduct during the contest. Referees must instruct contestants that
    wrestling and rough tactics will not be tolerated and to protect themselves at all times.
    The contestants, after receiving final instructions, shall shake hands and retire to their
    corners. They shall not shake hands again until the beginning of the last round.</p>
    <p>(b) The referee may stop a fight during or between rounds because of an injury or a
    contestant's poor physical condition. He may also stop a fight and make a decision to
    disqualify both contestants if he feels they are not boxing in earnest.</p>
    <p>(c) When a low blow incapacitates a contestant, the referee shall give him a reasonable
    time to recover. The referee may confer with the ringside physician. No contestant may be
    awarded a contest on a low-blow foul claim. If a contestant falls to the ring floor or
    otherwise shows an unwillingness to continue because of a low-blow claim, he shall be
    declared the loser by a technical knockout.</p>
    <p>(d) When a punch knocks a contestant down, the referee shall order the opponent to go
    to the ring's farthest neutral corner, pointing to the corner, and immediately pick up the
    timekeeper's count. He shall audibly announce the passing of the seconds,accompanying the
    count with upward motions of his arm for each second and indicating the count with visual
    finger counts after each second. The referee shall stop counting if the opponent does not
    remain in the neutral corner until the count is complete. No contestant who is knocked
    down shall be allowed to resume boxing until the referee has finished counting to eight.
    If a contestant who is down rises before the count of eight and goes down again without
    being struck, the referee shall resume the count where he stopped. When a round, other
    than the last round, ends before a contestant who was knocked down rises, the bell shall
    not ring, and the count shall continue. If he rises before the count of eight, the bell
    shall ring and end the round. The referee's count is the official one.</p>
    <p>(e) If a contestant leaves the ring during the one minute period between rounds and is
    not in the ring to resume boxing when the bell rings, the referee shall count that
    contestant out as if he were down.</p>
    <p>(f) If a contestant who has been knocked out of the ring or has fallen out of the ring
    during the contest fails to return immediately, the referee shall count him out as if he
    were down. Seconds shall not help contestants back into the ring.</p>
    <p>(g) If during the first three rounds a contestant is pushed, knocked or falls out of
    the ring, is injured by the fall and is unable to return, the referee will declare the
    bout a technical draw. If it happens during later rounds, all completed rounds shall be
    scored and the boxer ahead on points shall be declared the winner by technical decision.</p>

    less. When a round is even, each contestant shall receive 10 points. A clean knockdown
    shall be scored heavily. The referee shall call time and then advise the judges of a foul
    when it occurs and the number of points they should deduct. Referees and judges shall
    clearly write their decision and sign them individually. A draw shall be called if each
    official votes differently or any two vote a draw.</p>
    <p>(d) When a boxer is knocked down three times in any round, the contest shall be
    automatically stopped. The boxer scoring the knockdowns shall be the winner by a technical
    knockout. The referee may stop a contest at any time if the boxer cannot defend himself.</p>
    <p>(e) If a boxer is accidentally butted in a fight but can continue, the referee may stop
    the contest, for a reasonable time, and inform the judges and the boxer's seconds of the
    head butt. If a contest is stopped before the end of the third round because of an
    accidental butt, the contest shall be declared a technical draw. If after the third round
    an accidental butt injury occurs or worsens and the contest is stopped, all completed
    rounds shall be scored. The boxer ahead on points shall be declared the winner by
    technical decision.</p>
    <p>(f) If the contestant who is knocked down does not rise before the count of 10, the
    referee shall declare him the loser by a knockout. If the contestant appears to the
    referee to be seriously injured, the referee may summon the ringside physician into the
    ring, while continuing the count.</p>
    <p>(g) When a contestant does not answer the bell signifying the start of a round, the
    referee shall give a ten count and declare him the loser by a technical knockout.</p>
    <p>(h) Scoring shall be recorded only on the department-approved and department-provided
    form. Once the form is completed, checked and signed by the official it must be given

    willreceive a warning. If a contestant continues avoiding contact, he or she will be

    that reason, he or she may be subject to the same penalties and procedures as a contestant
    guilty of foul tactics.</p>
    <p>(f) In any case where the referee decides that the contestants are not honestly
    competing, that the knockout is a &quot;dive&quot;, or the foul is a prearranged
    termination of the bout, he or she will not finish the knockout count, disqualify the
    contestant for fouling, or render a decision, but shall stop the bout and declare it ended
    not later than before the end of the last round. He shall also order purses of both
    fighters held pending investigation and disposition of the funds by the Department.</p>
    <p>(g) No contestant shall leave the ring during the oneminute rest period between rounds.
    If any contestant fails or refuses to resume fighting when the bell sounds for starting
    the next round, the referee will award a knockout victory to his or her opponent as of the
    round which has just been finished. If the circumstances indicate to the referee the need
    for an investigation or disciplinary action, the referee will not make a decision and will
    order the purse or purses of either or both contestants withheld.</p>
    <p>(h) Before a fallen contestant resumes fighting after having been knocked to, slipped
    to, or fallen to the floor, the referee shall wipe the contestant's gloves free of any
    foreign substance.</p>
