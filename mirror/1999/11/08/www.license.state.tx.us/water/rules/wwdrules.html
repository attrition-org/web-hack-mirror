    commingle through the borehole-casing annulus or the gravel pack and cause quality
    degradation of any aquifer or zone.</p>
    <p>(f) The well casing shall be capped or completed in a manner that will prevent
    pollutants from entering the well.</p>
    <p>(g) Each licensed well driller drilling, deepening, or altering a well shall keep any
    drilling fluids, tailings, cuttings, or spoils contained in such a manner so as to prevent
    spillage onto adjacent property not under the jurisdiction or control of the well owner
    without the adjacent property owners written consent.</p>
    <p>(h) Each licensed well driller drilling, deepening, or altering a well shall prevent
    the spillage of any drilling fluids, tailings, cuttings, or spoils into any body of
    surface water.</p>
    <p>(i) Unless waived by written request from the landowner, a new, repaired, or
    reconditioned well or pump installation or repair on a well used to supply water for human
    consumption shall be properly disinfected. The well shall be properly disinfected with
    chlorine or other appropriate disinfecting agent under the circumstances. A disinfecting
    solution with a minimum concentration of 50 milligrams per liter (mg/l) (same as parts per
    million), shall be placed in the well as required by the American Water Works Association
    (AWWA), pursuant to ANST/AWWA C654-87 and the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA).</p>
    <p>(j) Unless waived in writing by the landowner, after performing an installation or
    repair, the licensed installer shall disinfect the well by:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) treating the water in the well casing to provide an average disinfectant residual
      to the entire volume of water in the well casing of 50 mg/l. This may be accomplished by
      the addition of calcium hypochlorite tablets or sodium hypochlorite solution in the
      prescribed amounts;</p>
      <p>(2) circulating, to the extent possible, the disinfected water in the well casing and
      pump column; and</p>
      <p>(3) pumping the well to remove disinfected water for a minimum of 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>(4) If calcium hypochlorite (granules or tablets) is used, it is suggested that the
      installer dribble the tablets of approximately five-gram (g) size down the casing vent and
      wait at least 30 minutes for the tablets to fall through the water and dissolve. If sodium
      hypochlorite (liquid solution) is used, care should be taken that the solution reaches all
      parts of the well. It is suggested that a tube be used to pipe the solution through the
      well-casing vent so that it reaches the bottom of the well. The tube may then be withdrawn
      as the sodium hypochlorite solution is pumped through the tube. After the disinfectant has
      been applied, the installer should surge the well at least three times to improve the
      mixing and to induce contact of disinfected water with the adjacent aquifer. The installer
      should then allow the disinfected water to rest in the casing for at least twelve hours,
      but for not more than twenty-four hours. Where possible, the installer should pump the
      well for a minimum of 15 minutes after completing the disinfection procedures set forth
      above until a zero disinfectant residual is obtained. In wells where bacteriological
      contamination is suspected, the installer should inform the well or property owner that
      bacteriological testing may be necessary or desirable.</p>

    direction. The device shall, by a mechanical force greater than the weight of the closing
    device, provide drip-tight closure against reverse flow. Hydraulic back pressure from the
    system does not satisfy this requirement.</p>
    <p>(d) The check valve construction should allow for easy access for internal and external
    inspection and maintenance. All internal parts shall be corrosion resistant. All moving
    parts shall be designed to operate without binding, distortion, or misalignment.</p>
    <p>(e) The check valve shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's
    specifications and maintained in a working condition during all times in which any
    fertilizer, pesticide, chemical, animal waste, or other foreign substance is injected into
    the water system. The check valve shall be installed between the pump discharge and the
    point of chemical injection or foreign substance injection.</p>
    <p>(f) A vacuum-relief device shall be installed between the pump discharge and the check
    valve in such a position and in such a manner that insects, animals, floodwater, or other
    pollutants cannot enter the well through the vacuum-relief device. The vacuum-relief
    device may be mounted on the inspection port as long as it does not interfere with the
    inspection of other anti-pollution devices.</p>
    <p>(g) An automatic low pressure drain shall also be installed between the pump discharge
    and the check valve in such a position and in such a manner that any fluid which may seep
    toward the well around the flapper will automatically flow out of the pump discharge pipe.
    The drain must discharge away from rather than flow into the water supply. The drain must
    not collect on the ground surface or seep into the soil around the well casing.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) The drain shall be at least three-quarter inch in diameter and shall be located on
      the bottom of the horizontal pipe between the pump discharge and the check valve.</p>
      <p>(2) The drain must be flush with the inside surface of the bottom of the pipe unless
      special provisions, such as a dam made downstream of the drain, forces seepage to flow
      into the drain.</p>
      <p>(3) The outside opening of the drain shall be at least two inches above the grade.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(h) An easily-accessible inspection port shall be located between the pump discharge
    and the check valve, and situated so the automatic low pressure drain can be observed
    through the port and the flapper can be physically manipulated.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) The port shall allow for visual inspection to determine if leakage occurs past the
      flapper, seal, seat, and/or any other components of the checking device.</p>
      <p>(2) The port shall have a minimum four-inch diameter orifice or viewing area. For
      irrigation distribution systems with pipe lines too small to install a four-inch diameter
      inspection port, the check valve and other anti-pollution devices shall be mounted with
      quick disconnects, flange fittings, dresser couplings, or other fittings that allow for
      easy removal of these devices.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(i) Any check valve not fully meeting the specifications set forth in this section may
    on request to the Executive Director be considered for a variance.</p>

    <p><a NAME="76.1008"></a><b>76.1008. Technical Requirements - Pump Installation.</b></p>
    <p>(a) During any repair or installation of a water well pump, the licensed installer
    shall make a reasonable effort to maintain the integrity of ground water and to prevent
    contamination by elevating the pump column and fittings, or by other means suitable under
    the circumstances.</p>
    <p>(b) This section shall include every type of connection device, including but not
    limited to, flange connections, hose-clamp connections, and other flexible couplings.
    Except as provided by this chapter, a pump shall be constructed so that no unprotected
    openings into the interior of the pump or well casing exist.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) A hand pump, hand pump head, stand, or similar device shall have a spout, directed
      downward.</p>
      <p>(2) A power driven pump shall be attached to the casing or approved suction or
      discharge line by a closed connection. For the purposes of this section a closed
      connection is defined to be a sealed connection.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(c) The provisions of this section relating to the requirement of closed connections
    shall not apply to the following types of pumps and pumping equipment:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) sucker rod pumps and windmills; and</p>
      <p>(2) hand pumps.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(d) A new, repaired, or reconditioned well, or pump installation or repair on a well
    used to supply water for human consumption shall be properly disinfected. The landowner
    may waive the disinfection process by submitting a written request to the driller or pump
    installer.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a NAME="76.1009"></a><b>76.1009. Technical Requirements - Alternative Standards.</b></p>
    <p>(a) If the party having the well drilled, deepened or altered, the licensed well
    driller, or the party, landowner or person drilling or plugging the well, finds any of the
    procedures prescribed by §76.1004 Technical Requirements - Standards for Capping and
    Plugging of Wells and Plugging Wells that Penetrate Undesirable Water or Constituent Zones
    and §76.1000 of this title (relating to Technical Requirements - Standards for Capping
    and Plugging of Wells and Plugging Wells that Penetrate Undesirable Water or Constituent
    Zones) inapplicable, unworkable, or inadequate, combinations of the prescribed procedures
    or alternative procedures may be employed, provided that the proposed alternative
    procedures will prevent injury and pollution.</p>
    <p>(b) Proposals to use combinations of prescribed procedures or alternative procedures
    shall be considered application for a variance and must be submitted to the Department for
    approval prior to their implementation.</p>
    <p>(c) This section shall not apply to a public water system well.</p>
