<P>(Austin) – Today, Bill Kuntz takes over as the new Executive Director of the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The Department’s governing commission unanimously approved him on August 30. He replaces Rachelle A. Martin, who left state service.</P>

<P>Prior to his appointment, Mr. Kuntz served in a number of different capacities in state government. Most recently, he was Manager of Administration and MIS with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. He has also worked at the Texas Real Estate Commission and State Securities Board. In the private sector, his experience includes serving as a Consultant with the National Assessment Institute.

<P>"As we begin work on the Agency Strategic Plan for 2001-2005, I want to assure that all of the agency’s constituent groups have the opportunity to participate in the process," Mr. Kuntz stated.</P>
<P>Created in 1909 as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation promotes a fair business environment and protects the public welfare and safety by regulating 17 diverse industries and programs, including boxing, air conditioning contractors, and architectural barriers.</P>
