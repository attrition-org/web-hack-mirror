<p ALIGN="CENTER">TEXAS COMMISSION OF LICENSING AND REGULATION DECIDES NOT TO APPEAL COURT
DECISION IN RELIGIOUS FACILITIES LAWSUIT</p>
</b>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Austin) &#150; The Texas Commission of Licensing and Regulation, the governing body of
the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR), voted today not to appeal the
recent court decision overturning TDLR&#146;s interpretation of the Texas Architectural
Barriers Act applicability towards religious facilities (<i>Coalition of Texans with
Disabilities (CTD) v. Tommy Smith in his official capacity and successors, and the TDLR
Commission</i>). The Third Court of Appeals ruled that TDLR&#146;s interpretation granted
too broad of an exemption for religious facilities.</p>

<p>&quot;The court ruling provides a fair compromise between the positions of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the disability community,&quot; said Bill Kuntz,
Executive Director of TDLR. &quot;Unlike the ADA, state law mandates accessibility in most
parts of religious facilities, enabling more Texans to enjoy personal independence while
celebrating their faith. Further, the court ruling has remanded the case to the district
court for subsequent proceedings.&quot;</p>

<p>The state law maintains that the architectural barriers standards &quot;do not apply to
a place used primarily for religious rituals within either a building or facility of a
religious organization&quot; (Section 2(g), Article 9102, Vernon&#146;s Texas Civil
Statutes). Prior to the court ruling, TDLR had exempted the entire sanctuary building and
any connected buildings. That interpretation was challenged in a lawsuit by CTD contending
that it exceeded the scope of the statute. The federal ADA exempts &quot;religious
organizations or entities controlled by religious organizations, including places of
worship&quot; (ADA, Sec. 307).</p>

<p>&quot;It is important to note that the state law applies only to new construction or
renovations exceeding $50,000. Existing religious facilities not undergoing such
renovations are not affected,&quot; Mr. Kuntz stated.</p>

<p>The Texas Commission of Licensing and Regulation is comprised of six members appointed
by the Governor to oversee the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. Created in
1909 as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation
promotes a fair business environment and protects the public welfare and safety by
regulating 17 diverse industries and programs, including elevators, boxing, and air
conditioning contractors. It received responsibility for enforcement of the architectural
barriers program in 1991.</p>
