      criminal activity of the same type as that in which the person was previously involved.</p>
    </blockquote>

      <p>(2) the age of the person at the time of the commission of the crime;</p>
      <p>(3) the amount of time that has elapsed since the person's last criminal activity;</p>
      <p>(4) the conduct and work activity of the person prior to and following the criminal
      activity;</p>
      <p>(5) evidence of the person's rehabilitation or rehabilitative effort while incarcerated
      or following release; and</p>
      <p>(6) other evidence of the persons' present fitness, including letters of recommendation
      from prosecution, law enforcement, and correctional officers who prosecuted, arrested, or
      had custodial responsibility for the person; the sheriff and chief of police in the
      community where the person resides; and any other persons in contact with the convicted
      person.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(d) It shall be the responsibility of the license holder or applicant, to the extent
    possible, to secure and provide the department the recommendations of the prosecution, law
    enforcement and correctional authorities as required.</p>
    <p>(e) Proof shall be furnished in such form as may be required by the department, that he
    or she has maintained a record of steady employment, has supported his or her dependents
    per court order, has otherwise maintained a record of good conduct, and has paid all
    outstanding court costs, supervision fees, fines and restitution as may have been ordered
    in all criminal cases in which he or she has been convicted.</p>
