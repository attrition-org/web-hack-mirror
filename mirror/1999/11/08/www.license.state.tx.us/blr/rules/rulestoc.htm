        blowdown adjustment, provided the differential in popping pressure between steam and air
        or nitrogen, as specified in the quality control manual, are applied to the popping point.</p>

        for testing purposes and/or making adjustments. Calibrated testing equipment shall be used
        and detailed testing procedures followed. In such cases, the manufacturer's
        recommendations shall be used to establish blowdown.</p>

    <p>(c) Assignment of boiler numbers and identification.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) Texas boiler numbers shall be issued as a decal to all inspection agencies and
      deputy inspectors as requested in writing. Only numbers issued by the chief inspector
      shall be assigned to boilers. Only the official decal and corrosion-resistant metal tags
      supplied by the chief inspector may be used. Only one Texas boiler number shall be
      assigned to a boiler. Reassignment of Texas boiler numbers shall be made with the approval
      of the chief inspector.</p>
      <p>(2) During the first inspection of all boilers, the inspector shall stamp, except as
      provided for in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection, the Texas boiler number as near
      to the original American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code symbol stamping and
      required information as practicable. All numbers shall be given on the first inspection
      report, including the National Board registration number and manufacturer's serial number.
      The stamping shall consist of the letters TX and directly below the TX shall be stamped
      the Texas boiler number with a five point star stamped immediately adjacent to the first
      and last digit of the Texas boiler number. All stamping shall be accomplished by low

    <p>(d) Condemned boilers.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) Any boiler, stamped or identified with the corrosion-resistant metal tag, having
      been inspected and declared unsafe by the chief inspector or deputy inspector, shall be
      stamped by the inspector, with an X on the star on either side of the Texas boiler number,
      as shown by the following facsimile, which will designate a condemned boiler:</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="center">TX</p>
    <p align="center">X123456X</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(2) Any boiler, identified with the Texas boiler number decal, having been inspected
      and declared unsafe by the chief inspector or deputy inspector, shall be altered by the
      inspector by removing the star on either side of the Texas boiler number, as shown in
      Exhibit 4. This will designate a condemned boiler.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(e) General safety. If, in the judgment of the inspector, a boiler is unsafe for
    operation at the pressure previously approved, the pressure shall be reduced and proper
    repair made, or the boiler shall be removed from service.</p>
    <p>(f) Conditions not covered by rules. All conditions not specifically covered by these
    requirements shall be treated as new installations or be referred to the chief inspector
    for instruction.</p>

        <p>(G) When two or more boilers operating at different pressures and safety valve settings
        are interconnected, the lower pressure boilers or interconnected piping shall be equipped
        with safety valves of sufficient capacity to prevent overpressure, considering the maximum
        generating capacity of all boilers.</p>

        least two means of feeding, one of which should be a pump, injector, or inspirator. A
        source of feed directly from water mains at a pressure of at least 6.0% greater than the
        set pressure of the safety valve with the highest setting may be considered as one of the
        means of feeding. Boilers fired by gaseous, liquid, or solid fuel in suspension may be
        equipped with a single means of feeding water, provided means are furnished for the
        immediate shutoff of heat input if the feedwater is interrupted.</p>

    <p>(m) Hydrostatic tests.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) When there is a question or doubt about the extent of a defect found in a boiler,
      the inspector may require a hydrostatic test.</p>
      <p>(2) In preparing a boiler for a hydrostatic test, the boiler shall be filled with water
      to the stop valve and all air vented off. If the boiler to be tested is connected with
      other boilers that are under pressure, such connections shall be blanked off unless they
      have double stop valves on all connection pipes with a drain between.</p>
      <p>(3) During a hydrostatic test of a boiler, the safety valve or valves shall be removed
      or each valve disc shall be held to its seat by means of a testing clamp and not by
      screwing down the compression screw under the spring.</p>
      <p>(4) The minimum temperature of the water used to apply a hydrostatic test shall be 70
      degrees Fahrenheit, but the maximum temperature shall not exceed 120 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
      <p>(5) When a hydrostatic test is to be applied after inspection, the pressure shall be as
      follows.</p>
      <p>(A) For all cases involving the question of tightness, the pressure shall be equal to
      the set pressure of the safety valve or valves having the lowest setting.</p>
      <p>(B) For all cases involving the question of safety, the pressure shall be equal to one
      and one-half times the maximum allowable working pressure.</p>
      <p>(C) The pressure applied for a hydrostatic test shall not exceed one and one-half times
      the maximum allowable working pressure. In no case shall the test pressure be exceeded by
      more than 2.0%.<font FACE="Univers" SIZE="3"></p>
