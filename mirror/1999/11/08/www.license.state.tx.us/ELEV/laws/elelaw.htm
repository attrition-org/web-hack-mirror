    the owner of the real property entered into a contract for the purchase of the elevators,

    installation is the date of issuance of the municipal building permit under which the
    elevators, escalators, or related equipment was constructed or, if a municipal building
    permit was not issued, the date that electrical consumption began for the construction of
    the building in which the elevators, escalators, or related equipment was installed.</font></p>
