    <p>(a) Air conditioning and refrigeration contractor licenses are of two classes:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) A Class A license entitles the licensee to perform air conditioning and
      refrigeration contracting, of each type for which the license is endorsed, on systems,
      products, or equipment of any size or capacity; and</p>
      <p>(2) A Class B license entitles the licensee to perform air conditioning and
      refrigeration contracting, of each type for which the license is endorsed, on systems,
      products, or equipment of not more than 25 tons cooling capacity or of not more than 1.5
      million British thermal units per hour output heating capacity.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(b) Endorsements are of two types:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) an environmental air conditioning endorsement entitles the licensee to perform air
      conditioning and refrigeration contracting in relation to environmental air conditioning
      within the class of license held; and</p>
      <p>(2) a commercial refrigeration and process cooling and heating endorsement entitles the
      licensee to perform air conditioning and refrigeration contracting in relation to
      commercial refrigeration and process cooling and heating within the class of license held.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(c) Each license shall be endorsed for either environmental air conditioning or
    commercial refrigeration and process cooling and heating, or both. For each endorsement
    the licensee must perform satisfactorily on a separate examination related to the
    endorsement. A licensee may not perform under a state license air conditioning and
    refrigeration contracting of a type for which the person's license is not endorsed.</p>
    <p>(d) The commissioner shall prescribe separate examinations for each class of license
    and, within each class, separate examinations for environmental air conditioning and for
    commercial refrigeration and process cooling and heating.</p>
    <p>(e) An applicant for an air conditioning and refrigeration contractor license must be
    at least 18 years old and must present to the commissioner satisfactory evidence of at
    least 36 months of practical experience with the tools of the trade in the preceding five

    engineering, refrigeration engineering or mechanical engineering from an institution of
    higher education whose program is approved by the Texas State Board of Registration for
    Professional Engineers for the purpose of licensing professional engineers is considered
    the equivalent of two years of practical experience.</p>
    <p>(f) The application must be made on a form prescribed by the commissioner and must
    specify the class of license and each endorsement the applicant seeks. The application
    must be verified and must be accompanied by:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) evidence of the insurance coverage required under this Act;</p>
      <p>(2) a statement of the applicant's practical experience; and</p>
      <p>(3) the examination fee.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(g) The commissioner shall issue an air conditioning and refrigeration contractor
    license to an applicant who possesses the required qualifications, passes the appropriate
    examinations, and pays the examination fee and the original license fee required by this
    Act. An applicant who fails an examination is eligible for reexamination.</p>
    <p>(h) A license issued under this Act expires at the end of the license period set by the
    commission.</p>
    <p>(i) With the advice of the advisory board, the commissioner shall adopt rules relating
    to the use, display, and advertisement of a licensee's license.</p>
    <p></a><a NAME="section4a"><b>Section 4A. NOTICE OF EXAMINATION RESULTS.</b></p>
    <p>(a) Not later than the 30th day after the date on which an examination is administered
    under this Act, the commissioner shall notify each examinee of the results of the
    examination. However, if an examination is graded or reviewed by a national testing
    service, the commissioner shall notify examinees of the results of the examination not
    later than the 14th day after the date on which the commissioner receives the results from
    the testing service. If the notice of examination results graded or reviewed by a national
    testing service will be delayed for longer than 90 days after the examination date, the
    commissioner shall notify the examinee of the reason for the delay before the 90th day.</p>
    <p>(b) If requested in writing by a person who fails the examination, the commissioner
    shall furnish the person with an analysis of the person's performance on the examination.</p>
    <p></a><a NAME="section4b"><b>Section 4B. CONTINUING EDUCATION PROGRAMS.</b></p>
    <p>The commissioner may recognize, prepare, or administer continuing education programs
    for licensees. Participation in the programs is voluntary.</p>
    <p></a><a NAME="section4c"><b>Section 4C. LICENSE BY RECIPROCITY.</b></p>
    <p>The commissioner may waive any license requirement for an applicant with a valid
    license from another state with which this state has a reciprocity agreement.</p>
    <p></a><a NAME="section4d"><b>Section 4D. TEMPORARY LICENSE.</b></p>
    <p>(a) The commissioner, by rule, may provide for the issuance of a temporary license to
    perform air conditioning and refrigeration contracting.</p>
    <p>(b) The commissioner may issue a temporary license to an applicant who applies to the
    commissioner on a form prescribed by the commissioner and pays the required fees.</p>
    <p></a><a NAME="section5"><b>Section 5. DENIAL, SUSPENSION, OR REVOCATION OF LICENSE.</b></p>
    <p>(a) A violation of this Act or a rule adopted under this Act is a ground for the
    denial, suspension, or revocation of a license issued under this Act. The failure to
    provide proper installation, service, and mechanical integrity under this Act constitutes
    a violation of this Act. An intentional or knowing misrepresentation of necessary
    services, services to be provided,or services that have been provided, or a fraudulent
    promise made to influence, persuade, or induce an individual to contract for services
    constitutes a violation of this Act and a ground for the suspension or revocation of a
    license issued under this Act.</p>
    <p>(b) Proceedings for the denial, suspension, or revocation of a license and appeals from
    those proceedings are governed by the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act, as
    amended (Article 6252-13a, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes).</p>
    <p></a><a NAME="section5a"><b>Section 5A. CONSUMER COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION.</b></p>

    functions performed by the commissioner under this Act and the rights of consumers as

    complaint is filed with and resolved by the commissioner. The commissioner shall make the
    information available to the general public.</p>
    <p>(b) The commissioner shall investigate consumer complaints filed with the commissioner.

    or a rule adopted under this Act, the commissioner may take appropriate action under </a><a HREF="Acrlaw.htm#section5">Section 5</a> of this Act.</p>
