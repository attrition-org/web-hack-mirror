<dir>
  <dir>
    </b><p>(a) In order for a provider to comply with Section 6 of this article through the
    use of a reimbursement insurance policy, such policy must state that:<dir>
      <dir>
        <p>(1) the insurer that issued the reimbursement insurance policy shall reimburse or pay
        on behalf of the provider any covered amounts the provider is legally obligated to pay or
        shall provide the service that the provider is legally obligated to perform according to
        the provider's contractual obligations under the insured service contract issued or sold
        by the provider; and</p>
        <p>(2) if the covered service is not provided to a service contract holder within 60 days
        of proof of loss, payment shall be made directly from the reimbursement insurer to the
        service contract holder or the reimbursement insurer shall provide the required service.</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>(b) An insurer that issues a reimbursement insurance policy under this article may not
    cancel the policy until the insurer delivers to the provider a written notice of
    cancellation that complies with the requirements adopted for those notices under Articles
    21.49-2A and 21.49-2B, Insurance Code. The provider shall forward a copy of the
    cancellation notice to the commissioner not later than the 15th business day after the
    date the notice is delivered to the provider. The cancellation of a reimbursement
    insurance policy does not reduce the insurer's responsibility for service contracts issued
    by the provider and insured under the policy before the date of the cancellation.</p>
    <p>(c) For purposes of this section, the provider is considered the agent of the insurer
    that issues the reimbursement insurance policy for purposes of obligating the insurer to
    service contract holders in accordance with the service contract and this article.</p>
    <p>(d) This article does not prevent or limit the right of an insurer that issues a
    reimbursement insurance policy to seek indemnification or subrogation against a provider
    if the insurer pays or is obligated to pay a service contract holder any amount that the
    provider is obligated to pay under the terms of the service contract.</p>

  <dir>
    </b><p>(a) Each service contract marketed, sold, offered for sale, issued, made, proposed

    understandable language that is easy to read and shall disclose the applicable
    requirements set forth in this section.</p>
    <p>(b) A service contract insured under a reimbursement insurance policy under Section
    6(a) of this article must contain a statement substantially similar to the following:
    &quot;Obligations of the provider under this service contract are insured under a service
    contract reimbursement insurance policy.&quot; The service contract shall state the name
    and address of the insurer and state that in the event covered service is not provided by
    the service contract provider within 60 days of proof of loss by the service contract
    holder, the service contract holder may apply for reimbursement directly to the service
    contract reimbursement insurance company.</p>
    <p>(c) A service contract that is not insured under a reimbursement insurance policy must
    contain a statement substantially similar to the following: &quot;Obligations of the
    provider under this service contract are backed by the full faith and credit of the
    provider.&quot;</p>
    <p>(d) Each service contract shall state the name and address of the provider and shall
    identify any administrator, if different from the provider, the service contract seller,
    and the service contract holder, to the extent that the name of the service contract
    holder has been furnished by the service contract holder. The identities of those persons
    are not required to be preprinted on the service contract and may be added to the service
    contract at the time of sale.</p>
    <p>(e) Each service contract must state the purchase price of the contract and the terms
    under which the contract is sold. The purchase price is not required to be preprinted on

    holder.</p>
    <p>(f) Each service contract must state the terms, restrictions, or conditions governing
    cancellation of the service contract by either the provider or the service contract holder
    before the expiration date of the service contract. A provider shall mail a written notice
    of cancellation to the service contract holder at the last known address of the service
    contract holder contained in the records of the provider before the fifth day preceding
    the effective date of the cancellation. Prior notice is not required if the reason for
    cancellation is nonpayment of the provider fee, a material misrepresentation by the
    service contract holder to the provider, or a substantial breach of duties by the service
    contract holder relating to the covered product or its use. The notice must state the
    effective date of the cancellation and the reason for the cancellation.</p>
    <p>(g) Each service contract must:</p>

    </b><p>(a) Each service contract shall require the provider to permit the service contract
    holder to return the service contract not later than the 20th day after the date the
    service contract was mailed to the service contract holder or, if the service contract is
    delivered to the service contract holder at the time of sale, not later than the 10th day
    after the date of delivery. A service contract holder may void the service contract at a
    later time as permitted by the service contract.</p>
    <p>(b) If a contract holder returns a service contract under Subsection (a) of this
    section and a claim has not been made under the service contract before its return to the
    provider, the service contract is void and the provider shall refund to the service
    contract holder or credit to the account of the service contract holder the full purchase
    price of the service contract. The right provided by this section to void the service
    contract is not transferable and applies only to the original service contract purchaser.
    If a service contract is voided under this section and the provider does not pay the
    refund or credit the service contract holder's account before the 46th day after the date
    of the return of the service contract to the provider, the provider is liable to the
    contract holder for a penalty in an amount not to exceed 10 percent of the amount

<p>Notes: 

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>(a) Article 9034, Revised Statutes, as added by this Act, takes effect September 1,
    1999, and applies only to a service contract entered into on or after January 1, 2000. A
    service contract entered into before that date and renewed after that date is not subject
    to that article.</p>
    <p>(b) A person regulated under Article 9034, Revised Statutes, as added by this Act, is
    not required to comply with that article until January 1, 2000, but may implement the
    requirements of that article before January 1, 2000. The failure of a provider or other
    person to comply with that article or otherwise to administer a service contract plan in
    the manner required by that article before January 1, 2000, is not admissible in any
    court, arbitration, or alternative dispute resolution proceeding and may not otherwise be
    used to prove that the action of any person or the affected service contract was unlawful
    or otherwise improper.</p>
