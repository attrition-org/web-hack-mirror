    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) is at least 18 years of age;</p>
      <p>(2) is a citizen of the United States or a legal alien;</p>
      <p>(3) either (i) passes a written or oral examination demonstrating his knowledge of the
      auction business and of the laws of this state pertaining to the auction business; or (ii)
      shows proof of his employment by a licensed auctioneer for a period of one year during

    </blockquote>
    <p>(c) A person is eligible for an associate auctioneer's license if he:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) is a citizen of the United States or a legal alien; and</p>
      <p>(2) is employed under the direct supervision of a licensed auctioneer.</p>
    </blockquote>

    provided by the commissioner that establishes the applicant's eligibility for the license.
    The application must be accompanied by the required bond, the required license fee, and
    either the limited sales tax permit number issued by the comptroller of public accounts or
    proof of exemption from the limited sales tax permit requirement.</p>
    <p>(e) The commissioner shall prepare license examinations for an auctioneer's license and
    study and reference materials on which the examinations are based. The examination for
    auctioneers must be designed to establish the applicant's general knowledge of the auction
    business, the principles of conducting an auction, and the laws of this state pertaining
    to auctioneers. The license examination must be offered at least four times a year at
    locations designated by the commissioner.</p>
    <p>(f) A person who establishes his eligibility for an auctioneer's license may apply to

    standards at least equivalent to those of this state, and if the county, state, or
    political subdivision extends similar recognition and courtesies to this state, the
    commissioner shall accept the license as proof of the applicant's professional competence
    and shallwaive the examination and training requirements of Paragraph (3), Subsection (b)
    of this section. All other application requirements must be complied with by nonresidents,
    and in addition, a nonresident's application shall be accompanied by a written irrevocable
    consent to service of process. The consent must provide that actions growing out of any
    transaction subject to this Act may be commenced against the licensee in the proper court
    of any county of this state in which the cause of action may arise, or in which the
    plaintiff may reside, by a service of process upon the commissioner as the licensee's
    agent and stipulating and agreeing that such service of process shall be taken and held in
    all courts to be as valid and binding as if due service has been made upon the person
    according to the laws of this or any other state. The consent of service of process shall
    be in such form and supported by such additional information as the commissioner may by
    rule require.</p>
    <p>(h) A license issued under this Act shall be issued for the period set by the

    service, the commissioner shall notify examinees of the results of the examination not
    later than the 14th day after the date on which the commissioner receives the results from

    has insufficient assets to pay amounts awarded. If the fund contains insufficient assets
    to pay the consumer, the manager shall record the time and date of receipt of an order for
    payment to a consumer. As funds become available, the commissioner shall pay consumers
    with unpaid orders by time and date of the order.</p>

    advancement of the auctioneer profession in this state.</p>
    <p></a><a NAME="consumer"><b>CONSUMER CLAIMS</b></p>
    <p><b>Section 5C.</b></p>
    <p>(a) A person who deals with an auctioneer licensed under this Act and who is aggrieved
    by an action of the auctioneer as a result of a violation of a contract made with the
    auctioneer may initiate a claim against the fund by filing with the department:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) a sworn complaint against the auctioneer; and</p>
      <p>(2) a filing fee of $50.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(b) After a claim is filed, the department shall investigate the complaint and
    determine the amount due the aggrieved party. If the amount determined by the department
    is disputed by the auctioneer or the aggrieved party, the department's hearings examiner
    shall conduct a hearing in accordance with departmental rules on the claim and determine
    the amount due the aggrieved party.</p>
    <p>(c) The hearings examiner shall prepare a proposal for decision for the commissioner. A
    party may appeal a decision of the commissioner in the manner provided for contested cases
    under the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article 6252-13a, Vernon's
    Texas Civil Statutes).</p>
    <p>(d) A hearing on a claim may be conducted at the department's Austin office, or at
    another location as provided by department rule.</p>
    <p>(e) If the amount determined by the department's investigation to be due the aggrieved
    party is not disputed by the auctioneer or the aggrieved party, the commissioner shall pay
    the claim within the limits of this Act.</p>
    <p>(f) If a hearing is held on a disputed amount, the commissioner shall pay to the
    aggrieved party the amount of actual damages determined by the commissioner. The amount
    may not include attorneys' fees, speculative damages, or lost profits. The amount must be
    within the following limits:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) in making payments from the fund the commissioner may not pay a single aggrieved
      party more than $10,000;</p>
      <p>(2) the total payment of all claims by more than one aggrieved party arising from one
      auction at one location, regardless of the length of the auction, may not exceed $20,000;
      and</p>
      <p>(3) the total payment of claims against a single auctioneer may not exceed $20,000.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(g) The commissioner may not pay a claim against an auctioneer who was not licensed at
    the time of the transaction on which the claim is based.</p>
    <p>(h) If the commissioner pays a claim against an auctioneer, the auctioneer shall:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) reimburse the fund immediately or agree in writing to reimburse the fund on a
      schedule to be determined by rule of the commissioner; and</p>
      <p>(2) immediately pay the aggrieved party any amount due to that party or agree in
      writing to pay the aggrieved party on a schedule to be determined by rule of the
      commissioner.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(i) Payments made by the auctioneer to the fund or to the aggrieved party under this
    section shall include interest accruing at the rate of eight percent a year beginning on
    the date that the commissioner pays the claim.</p>
    <p>(j) A license granted under this Act may be revoked by the commissioner on proof that
    the commissioner has made a payment from the recovery fund for actions of the licensee.
    The commissioner may probate an order revoking a license. An auctioneer is not eligible to
    receive a new license until the auctioneer has repaid in full, plus interest, the amount
    paid from the recovery fund on the auctioneer's account unless, after a hearing, the
    commissioner issues a new probated license.</p>
    <p>(k) If the commissioner pays a claim against an auctioneer, the department is
    subrogated to all rights of the aggrieved party against the auctioneer to extent of the
    amount paid to the aggrieved party.</p>
    <p>(l) This section does not limit the authority of the commissioner to take disciplinary
    action against a license for a violation of this section or the rules and regulations of
    the commissioner, nor shall the repayment in full of all obligation to the recovery fund
    by a licensee nullify or modify the effect of any other disciplinary proceeding brought
    under this Act.</p>
    <p>(m) A person commits an offense if, with intent to obtain a benefit for himself or
    herself or to harm another, the person:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) institutes a claim under this Act in which the person knows the person has no
      interest; or</p>
      <p>(2) institutes a frivolous suit under this Act or a claim under this Act that the
      person knows is false.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(n) An offense under Subsection (m) of this section is a Class B misdemeanor.</p>
    <p></a><a NAME="preemption"><b>PREEMPTION</b></p>
    <p><b>Section 6.</b></p>

    <p></a><a NAME="denial"><b>DENIAL, SUSPENSION, OR REVOCATION OF LICENSE</b></p>

    <p>(a) The commissioner may deny, suspend, or revoke the license of any auctioneer for any
    of the following causes:</p>
    <blockquote>

      <p>(2) for making any substantial misrepresentation in an application for an auctioneer's
      license;</p>
      <p>(3) for a continued and flagrant course of misrepresentation or for making false
      promises through agents, advertising, or otherwise;</p>
      <p>(4) for failing to account for or remit, within a reasonable time, any money belonging
      to others that comes into his possession and for commingling funds of others with his own
