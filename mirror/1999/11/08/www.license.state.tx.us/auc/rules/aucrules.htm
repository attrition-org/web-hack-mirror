    hearing held on a disputed amount, that the auctioneer owes to the aggrieved person
    damages greater than the maximum of $10,000 allowed under the Act, the auctioneer must pay
    the amount not paid by the department to the aggrieved party. If the department determines
    that the auctioneer owes damages to more than one aggrieved person arising out of one
    auction at one location, and the sum of all damages owed exceeds $20,000, the department
    shall pro-rate $20,000 from the Recovery Fund among the aggrieved persons, and the
    auctioneer must pay the amount not paid to each of the aggrieved persons.</p>
    <p>(b) The total payment from the Recovery Fund of claims against an auctioneer may not
    exceed $20,000. If additional claims are filed before the auctioneer has reimbursed the
    Fund and repaid any amounts due an aggrieved party, the department shall hold a hearing to
    determine if the additional claims must be satisfied by the auctioneer before the
    commissioner issues a new license, whether probated or not.</p>
    <p>(c) If a claim is paid against an auctioneer, and the auctioneer cannot immediately
    reimburse the Recovery Fund, the commissioner may allow the auctioneer to sign an

    associate auctioneer to suspend or revoke his license based upon proof of cause of action
    and final order issued by another state, whether or not the department has a reciprocal

    or misdemeanor convictions or to any offense against the other state's law or
    administrative rules.</p>
    <p>(b) The department may initiate administrative action to deny a license based upon
