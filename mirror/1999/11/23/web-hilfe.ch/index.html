Happy thanksgiving you turkeys. Get some fucking security. BTW, Bigdaddy is a stupid
fuck. I wouldn't normal rehack anybody's shit, but he didn't even back up the old index, 
and it appears like he got rid of most of the data. That's not what hacking is about.
I have to agree, defacing is fun, but not actually deleting the data.<p>
