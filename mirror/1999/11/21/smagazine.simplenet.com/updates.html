SM is, has, and always will be uncommercialized. So why did I allow advertisements to stay on the message board? Because of my extreme hatred of censorship. I refuse to censor anything and I think that's where some problems were coming from. So with that in mind, the message board has been removed from the site. You have only the spammers to thank for this. I'm not censoring them, I'm just removing their speaking platform.  Also, our search engine index has been cleansed of all links to non-hacking related content.

Those ugly (and temporary) text links are gone now.  We've finished designing our OWN browser redirection script and we've implemented it on our archives page and our covers section.  Our advice: never use those free scripts.  You never know when they'll go down.  It seems to be working well which is DAMN good considering the lack of cgi knowlege amongst the SM team.  Also, the counter has been reset.

We've just been rated by RSACi... (big deal)  We've also changed the "defaultstatus" of our site to "The l33test hax0rz EVER... (not really)" instead of "Anything less would be uncivilized"... once again (big deal).  Nothing major has been changed.  Major events: inKK of team wellfare has just joined SM.

Issue #11 has been uploaded and it includes a new HMS article.  The hit counter on our main page is displaying erratic numbers and seems to avoid going any higher than 8000.  Every time it gets to 8999 it drops back down to about 7800.  Strange eh?  It's done this 4 times now.  Anyway, we've moved it to a less prominent position on the main page.

<b><i>4:49am CST October 15 1999</i></b><br>
Cgi-Free's browser redirection form script seems to have stopped working, causing our readers to have problems downloading issues from the "archives" and "covers" areas.  It's been fixed and we're using simple text links now.  Also, the MP3 section has been discontinued because the constant downloads ground the entire system to almost a halt and people couldn't view the site.  Oh yeah, and the mailing list signup form has been moved to the "contact" area.
<hr>
<b><i>11:41pm CST (yes, CST, moved again...) September 14 1999</i></b><br>
Issue #10 has been uploaded, also the "telnettable BBS List" file in our HMS section has been updated with a whopping 599 telnettable BBSes!!  The biggest list on the net (we think).
<hr>
<b><i>1:19pm EST August 17 1999</i></b><br>
Issue #9 is complete, also added a few more MP3 files.  The site's underlying structure will soon change, but it should not be noticeable to the casual surfer.
<hr>
<b><i>9:33am EST (Yes, I've moved again) June 6 1999</i></b><br>
Issue #8 has just been uploaded.
<hr>
<b><i>11:06pm CST April 23 1999</i></b><br>
Our covers section has been modified so you can view individual articles instead of having to download an entire issue.  This is only for issue #4 and up.  Thank us later.
<hr>
<b><i>4:03am CST April 22 1999</i></b><br>
Uploaded a few MP3s and started on the section.  It's workable now, but eventually, It'll be much bigger.  And for those of you that had links on our links page, don't worry.  We've transferred your information to our search engine.
<hr>
<b><i>2:11am CST April 5 1999</i></b><br>
Issue #7 has been released.  We've also started building an mp3 section to be opened soon after we kill our links page.  It's going to die because our search engine is just cooler. Ph33r!  Due to some requests, we've dug up our ENTIRE old snv archive and added it in zip/exe form to our archives page.  Please note that some articles are quite old, and the information in some has even been proven to be false.

<b><i>11:19pm CST (yes, CST, I've moved) March 7 1999</i></b><br>
We've just finished designing our own search engine written in the MIVA language.  Check it out on our main page and add your favorite sites!!
<hr>
<b><i>1:11am EST February 9 1999</i></b><br>
After recieving many complaints, we've fixed the problem with Issue #6 and have uploaded the new WORKING issue.  We've also released our WAR issue which covers recent events in the underground community.
<hr>
<b><i>11:05pm EST February 6 1999</i></b><br>
Fixed a stupid mistake on the main page.  We forgot to update the title in one of the table cells to "Issue #6".  It still said "Issue #5".  Sorry about that.
<hr>
<b><i>9:36pm EST February 4 1999</i></b><br>
Updated the covers and archives sections for the release of SM6.  Also began working on a hobbies section (not available for viewing) with a soon-to-be baseball card auction sponsored by us here at SM.
<hr>
<b><i>2:31am EST January 12 1999</i></b><br>
Moved the forum from the archives page to our main page in a final effort to generate interest.  If I move it again, it'll be off the site.
<hr>
<b><i>12:33pm EST January 7 1999</i></b><br>
Updated all meta tags so pages display correctly in the search engines.
<hr>
<b><i>11:57pm EST January 4 1999</i></b><br>
Redesigned the "covers page" and turned it into an entire "covers area".  It not only displays the magazine covers, it also tells you what's inside each issue.  We think it looks nice.
<hr>
<b><i>2:38am EST January 3 1999</i></b><br>
Issue #5 uploaded.  Also cleaned up some un-needed HTML.
<hr>
<b><i>12:36am EST December 7 1998</i></b><br>
Added cover images for issue #5.  Went down approximately 30 mins for routine cleanup and updating of network, client, and server software.
<hr>
<b><i>12:16am EST November 19 1998</i></b><br>
Issue #4 is out and it explains what happened to SM in the past few months, and is also the biggest magazine we've thrown together yet.
<hr>
<b><i>10:24pm EST November 12 1998</i></b><br>
Finally finished fixing all of our forms.  It seems cgi-free's from mailer no longer works, so our allegiance is elsewhere now.
<hr>
<b><i>12:37am EST November 7 1998</i></b><br>
We're finally back online and working again.  It's all going to be explained in the next issue.  Added a new HMS article.
<hr>
<b><i>2:33am EST August 30 1998</i></b><br>
SM Issue #3 is out!  Also updated all pages for quicker displaying.
<hr>
<b><i>1:46am EST August 13 1998</i></b><br>
Redesigned our main page.  Tell us what you think.
<hr>
<b><i>3:02pm EST August 5 1998</i></b><br>
Added text versions of SM.  That should solve the size problems we've been having with the magazine.  We also removed the old SNV archive.
<hr>
<b><i>2:57pm EST August 2 1998</i></b><br>
SM Issue #2 is out!  Tell your friends.  Also removed the cheezy chatroom from the site.  Maybe one day, all the cheese will be gone.
<hr>
<B><I>6:05pm EST July 27 1998</i></b><br>
Removed the cheezy Guestbook stuff and added a simple "comments" form.  Also uploaded the beginnings of a links page.
<hr>
<b><i>9:47pm EST July 19 1998</i></b><br>
Replaced deleted index file and updated security.  We were obviously hacked.  Also added menus to the bottom of most pages.
<hr>
<b><i>2:53pm EST July 16 1998</i></b><br>
Added ALT attributes for all images to hopefully increase search engine rankings.  Edited "keywords" META tag.
<hr>
<b><i>11:44pm EST July 15 1998</i></b><br>
Updated the text on the chatroom page for lack of time to host it.  Also created this page and the new covers page.  Edited the main page to accomodate the two new sections.
