<FONT SIZE=4><P>The After School Program (ASP) will be offered at elementary schools again this year. Initiated in 1988, the ASP is operated for the benefit of the students and as a service to parents by providing a safe, structured environment staffed by Coweta County School System personnel.</P>
<P>Students may stay in the ASP from school dismissal until 6:00 p.m. Teachers, teaching assistants, and cafeteria personnel offer a variety of learning enrichment activities for the students. Homework sessions are required daily, Monday through Thursday. Snacks are served, and supervised recreational activities are provided each day.</P>
<P>The cost of the program is $5.00 per child per day reserved when paid during the week before the week of attendance. Tuition payments made during the week of attendance are $7.00 per day reserved. A student may maintain enrollment in the ASP by attending at least one day per week.</P>
<P>Each ASP is managed by a site coordinator located at the school. Site coordinators will be at the schools beginning August 9<SUP>th</SUP> and will also register students during Orientation Day, August 11.</P>
<B><P>You may obtain additional information from ASP Director Earl Coulter at 770-254-2827.<P>
