<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Objective:</FONT></FONT>

<P>The student will be able to measure to nearest 1/4 inch and will be
able to cut a length to fit those measurements.

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Activities:</FONT></FONT>

<P>(Prior to activity students will need to bring in a photo or picture.
The teacher should also have strips of paper avaliable for students to
use.)

<P>Students will make a frame to fit around the perimeter of their picture
that has been brought in. They should measure each side of the picture
(to the nearest 1/4 inch) and record the measurements. They then will measure
from strips of paper that are provided and cut the same measurements that
they recorded previously. They then will glue the sections of the strips
to the edges of the picture to create a frame. (Each corner should overlap.)

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Evaluation:</FONT></FONT>

<P>Teacher should check student's picture to see that frame fits around
it to the nearest 1/4 inch.
