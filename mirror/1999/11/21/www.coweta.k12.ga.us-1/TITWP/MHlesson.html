The teacher will establish a banking system for the student to encourage
positive actions and discourage negative actions. Play money (copies of
one, five, ten, and twenty dollar bills with school logo replacing presidents'
faces) will be awarded to the student for behavior such as being on time
for class, being prepared for class, paying attention, class participation,
etc. The money amount can be determined by the teacher. Tellers can be
trained to allow classmates to make deposits. For negative behavior such
as not being prepared, talking without permission, not participating in
class discussion, etc., the student will have to write a check for an amount
determined by the teacher. The student will be encouraged to keep his checks
and deposits recorded in a ledger. The teacher along with the tellers will
create a statement so that the student can balance his checkbook. Checks
and ledgers can be created be the teacher and copies given to the student.
The local bank can be contacted for possible donations and volunteers to
help establish this banking system.</FONT>

the end of the grading period, the student may use his checks to buy items,
purchase food (pizza or ice cream), in exchange for free computer time,
etc. Items for purchases can be donated by local stores and businesses.
If the student is able to balance his checkbook within five dollars the
student will show mastery.</FONT>
