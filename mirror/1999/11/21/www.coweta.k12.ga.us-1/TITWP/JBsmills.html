<P><FONT COLOR="#004080">Southern Mills is a textile industry specializing
in the production of the latest protective fabrics for firefighter clothing
and station uniforms, the fire blocking fabric which is used in airplane
seating, space shuttle crew launch and re-entry suits as well as boot insulation
padding worn by astronauts, ironing pads, lawn mower grass catcher bags,
and various linens used both in and out of the United States.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#004080">Established in 1925, Southern Mills presently
has </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">5 plants</FONT><FONT COLOR="#004080">
all located in Georgia. Corporate Headquarters, located in Union City,
houses the latest in advance lab equipment to test the strength, durability,
flame-resistance, and quality of fabrics. The Nonwoven division, located
in Senoia, along with its "sister" plant next door, Plant Ellis, creates
its own thread and yarn spinning and weaving it into various fabrics. Plant
Ray, located in Molena, then takes the fabric, knits it together, and puts
it through a dying and finishing process. The Atlanta plant was the original
plant and still houses some of the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>oldest
and largest looms</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#004080"> and weaving/knitting
equipment in the textile industry.</FONT>
