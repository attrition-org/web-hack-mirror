<HR SIZE=5 WIDTH="100%">

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">All three Coweta County high schools have adopted
a modified "4 by 4" block schedule beginning this school year. Under this
plan, students will</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#000000">register for four classes
per 90-day semester. Classes will be 90 minutes</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#000000">in
length each day, earning one credit each per semester. Students can earn
a total of eight units per school year under the new plan.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Punctual and regular daily attendance in class
is vital to the success of</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">any student and is more critical in block scheduling
because of the</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">compressed nature of instruction. To comply with
local board of education policy and to ensure that students receive maximum
benefit from the instructional activities, students are expected to attend
class each day.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Absences will be classified as excused or unexcused.
Excused absences are those due to emergencies such as illness, death in
the family, or other</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#000000">special circumstances
such as religious holidays, serving as a page in the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#000000">General
Assembly, school sponsored activities, and registering to vote.</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Unexcused absences are all failure to attend school
other than those</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#000000">specifically excused by the
administration. Parents will be notified after</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#000000">the
third absence each term.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Absences and tardies will be recorded in homeroom
and in each individual class period. For grading purposes, the individual
class absences will be used to determine the number of days absent. Make-up
work for absences must be completed according to the grading policy established
by the teacher within the system and school guidelines. Both excused and
unexcused absences from class will result in the loss of full credit for
class participation missed unless the student makes arrangements to make
up the work with each teacher within three (3) school days upon returning
to school. All make-up assignments, including tests, are to be completed
within a reasonable time based on the length of the absence and agreement
between the teacher and student.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In order to make up work after five days of absence
in each term, the</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">student must receive written permission from
an administrator. A parent</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#000000">conference may
be required at this point. The school administration may</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#000000">also
require an excuse from a doctor, dentist, health center or court.</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Students with excessive absences will be referred
to the school social</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#000000">worker and/or the appropriate
legal authorities.&nbsp; Individual schools or teachers may provide incentives
for good attendance.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Dr. Judy Robinson, Coweta County Schools Director
of Secondary Education, reminds parents that students need to enroll as
soon as possible and be present on the very first day of school. "Students
who show up late," she said, " especially after Labor Day, will have missed
too much school to pass."</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">East Coweta High School principal Eddie Lovett
adds, " It is imperative that students think about the fact that they will
complete a unit of credit in one semester, whereas in the past it took
the whole year to complete the same amount of work. This is possible because
of the 90-minute classes.&nbsp; Good attendance is critical this year.
Teachers have been trained to use a variety of teaching methods designed
to be effective during longer class periods. A student who chooses not
to attend class will miss much more than what he or she would have missed
last year. I encourage each student not to miss class."&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;
