<FONT SIZE=4><P>School safety is still foremost in our minds after Colorado and, more recently, as the problem has now occurred closer to home in Rockdale County, Georgia. Recently, I read an essay by noted author and expert in family relationships, Dr. Greg Baer. With his permission, I quote him here.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4><P>I’ve now heard a great number of experts and media people talk about the boys in Littleton, Colorado, who killed 15 people and wounded twice that many. People are mystified that two children from a "good" family, good neighborhood, and a good school could do such a thing. There’s finger pointing and confusion everywhere. People are blaming MTV, the schools, Marilyn Manson, the lack of gun control, video games, the Internet, the government, the lack of metal detectors, and so on.</P>
<P>The truth is not confusing. Imagine that I buy a cute little German Shepherd puppy. Then I chain him to a stake in my back yard and leave him there. He has plenty of food and a beautiful yard, but I don’t play with him, stroke him, pat him, or sit with him on my lap. I mostly ignore him, except when I go out to feed him, shout at him when he barks, and to kick him when I’m in a bad mood. You wouldn’t be terribly surprised to learn that my dog becomes a paranoid, vicious animal who barks all day and lunges at anything that moves. One day while I’m at work, my dog pulls his stake from the ground and tears through the fence between your yard and mine. Then he eats your cocker spaniel.</P>
<P>At this point, should we sue the people who put up the fence between our yards? Should we blame the company that manufactured the stake that failed to keep the dog in my yard? Should we blame the city because their dog-licensing laws were inadequate? Or complain to the distributors of the food my dog ate? Ridiculous. We should be talking to the incompetent, neglectful owner and trainer of the dog—ME.</P>
<P>Why do we have such a hard time making that obvious conclusion about our children? Who’s been there from the day of their birth? Who trained these children who are now misbehaving in a way that affects and concerns everyone around them? It wasn’t the Internet. It wasn’t the schools, nor was it their peers. It was US, their parents.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4><P>Baer makes sense, doesn’t he? Experts have been telling us for years that a child’s psychological makeup for life—in effect, the kind of person he is going to be for life—is determined in the first few formative years. This lands the bulk of the responsibility for the moral upbringing of children squarely on the shoulders where it belongs—on the parents, the two people who decided to bring the child into the world in the first place.</P>
<P>What, then, is the primary responsibility of educators in the child’s life? We are trained to impart skills and concepts related primarily to academics and vocational and professional preparation. In other words, we teach language, math, science, social studies and other subject matter concepts and skills so that students may learn a specific body of material and then learn how to learn whatever else necessary so that they can be productive members of society. Our teachers are nurturing people, too, especially in the Pre-Kindergarten through elementary years, and they are good role models throughout all the grade levels. But this must be secondary and supportive to parents’ nurturing and modeling. Yes, some state and federal mandates have required us to teach values. So, in the midst of teaching what used to be the simple "3 R’s" we have also had to take on the challenge of values education, sex education, multiculturalism, and inclusion. At the same time, the amount of knowledge that we are required to teach began to double at an alarming rate a few years ago and is now growing exponentially. </P>
<P>But what values do we teach? In traditional American society, families typically take their strongest values from religion, yet by law religion is taboo in public schools. People learn from meaningful consequences, yet society has, little by little, taken away the schools’ authority to impose consequences when students misbehave. The public cries loudly," Put discipline in our schools." Yet, what many individual parents are saying to us by their negative actions and lack of support is," But don’t discipline MY child." When proven methods are presented as possible solutions to many of the problems in our schools, some parents cry out loudly in resistance toward change.</P>
<P>It is time to look again at what our roles are in the upbringing of children. Schools exist first and foremost to teach skills and concepts of an academic and vocational nature. We also teach core values such as good citizenship, respect for others, and respect for self, but these are concepts which must be introduced and reinforced by parents. Parents have the responsibility of being the primary builders of the moral fiber that makes their children decent, productive members of society. This can only happen when we teach our children by being loving, firm, appropriate role models who nurture them and set limits and goals. We must then praise and reprimand our children and structure their immediate world in such a way that they learn to make appropriate choices by experiencing both positive and negative consequences for their actions. Parents must know what their children are doing, where they are spending time, what entertainment attracts them, what is in their rooms, and who their friends are. When parents do these things, then they send us young people who are more ready to get down to the precise business of learning what they need to learn at school while behaving themselves in an appropriate, respectful, nonviolent, productive manner.</P>
<P>I am happy to say that the overwhelming majority of our students are good people. Most of them rarely, if ever, get into serious trouble at school, and they strive to make good grades and have a sincere desire to become happy, productive citizens. They reflect a supportive, structured family life. As Coweta County experiences the happy struggles of overwhelming growth, it is always good to hear that many new families are moving into our area because they want a great place to raise a family. Let’s keep our eyes focused on our joint responsibility, and as parents and teachers, let’s make sure to do our different but necessary jobs with our youth. Let’s keep Coweta County a place where good schools are a great investment.</P>
