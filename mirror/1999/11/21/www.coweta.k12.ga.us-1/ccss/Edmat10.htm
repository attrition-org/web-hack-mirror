</B></FONT><P>&#9;As our schools approach the new millennium, there is a trend that will unquestionably affect education in our community well into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century. Of far more impact than a temporary Y2K problem, or technology, or any kind of legislation is the fact that large numbers of our teachers will be retiring. As the leading edge of the Baby Boomers reaches age fifty, the teachers who taught us through high school are retiring in large numbers.</P>
<P>&#9;So how will our school district fill the void, and what criteria will we be using to ensure that students continue to be taught with excellence?</P>
<P>&#9;First of all, teacher licensure today is not only stricter than in the past, but is also more standardized among the states. Great improvements have been made in raising requirements of newly licensed teachers to make certain that they are competent to teach children and that they have mastered their subject matter.</P>
<P>&#9;Second, we are <I>actively</I> looking for good teachers. We advertise through newspapers, college placement services, and the Internet. Job fairs, sponsored by colleges and universities for their education students, provide an opportunity for prospective teachers and school district personnel to meet and get acquainted. From these contacts, we will gather a pool of prospective candidates.</P>
<P>&#9;We know that great teachers demonstrate three important characteristics: First, they have a belief in the importance of education and teaching, together with a strong sense of satisfaction in helping students learn. Second, great teachers understand the importance of relationships. The adage, "Students don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care," is the creed they live by. Third, great teachers have a passion for learning and the subject matter they teach. In addition, they have the ability to motivate others to love learning.</P>
<P>&#9;Finding these characteristics in prospective teachers is the purpose and goal of the interview and screening process. Our district works with administrators and support staff in the process. We also include model teaching opportunities, thorough reference checks, and portfolios of their teaching work to determine who best qualifies. </P>
<P>The best of the teacher candidates will demonstrate the following:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<LI>An early and consistent commitment to working with children; </LI>
<LI>Evidence of successful experiences working with children of different ages and settings; and evidence that children have learned because of their teaching.</LI></UL>
</UL>

<P>Once new teachers have accepted teaching contracts, we provide immediate support and training through a mentorship program, orientation and training, and ongoing support during their first years of teaching. Specific staff development courses designed especially for beginning teachers are available in the summer after their first year. </P>
<P>Our school system takes the responsibility of selecting new teachers very seriously. Because today’s decisions influence the next generation, we try to provide the best teachers we can for our students in Coweta County where good schools are a great investment.</P></BODY>
