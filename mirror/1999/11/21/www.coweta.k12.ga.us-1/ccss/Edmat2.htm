<font size=+2> <b>Education Matters:</font><br> <center><font size=+1> A Message from Richard Brooks <br> Safety </b></font></center><BR><BR>
<BR><P>

	A primary concern for parents is the safety of their children.  With recent
headlines describing drive-by shootings, gang activity, and drug sales and
use, it's no wonder that parents are fearful.  These incidents, however,
occur more frequently in the neighborhood environment, away from the school
setting.  In fact, school is still the safest place for kids.
</P><P>	
	Recent research indicates that nationwide, fewer children suffer serious
injuries while at school or while participating in school-related activities
today than in the past.  What's more, the possibility of someone introducing
your child to drugs and  alcohol or that your child will become involved in
some type of violent action is greater in a neighborhood setting than at school.
</P><P>
	Why is this the case?  First, the level of adult supervision provided by
our schools is unmatched elsewhere in a child's life.  Children are
monitored or supervised by an adult from the time they board the bus in the
morning until they are released at the close of the school day.  Even their
extracurricular activities are supervised by one or more adults, either
acting as a club sponsor or as a coach.
	
</P><P>	Second, no organizations are more regulated in America today than are
schools.  School districts must adhere to the standards and safety policies
required by federal, state, and county agencies.  These concern everything
from educational issues to playgrounds and school lunches.  Fire prevention
regulations alone govern both new construction and building modifications.
They even determine the number and type of decorations a teacher can use in
his or her classroom.

</P><P>	The transportation program is heavily regulated as well.  Not only are
there standards for bus construction, but there are state licensing
requirements and mandatory safety training for bus drivers.  With more than
13,000 students transported over 6500 miles on buses daily in Coweta County,
there are valid reasons for establishing strict rules and regulations
governing their use.  As a result of these rules and regulations, children
are four times as safe on a school bus as they are in a private vehicle.

</P><P>	The Board of Education is always searching for ways to ensure the safety of
your children while they are in our care.  Photo identification badges for
all employees, visitor sign-in at school offices, call-back buttons in
classrooms, drug dogs, and school resource officers are just a few examples
of the implementation of safety procedures.  The transportation department
is currently studying a method of tracking school buses as they travel on
their daily routes.

</P><P>		The safety and well-being of your children are our top priority.  It's no
wonder that parents often breathe a sigh of relief when school resumes each
year.  They know that their children are acquiring new skills and knowledge,
and they also know that they are safe at school.  

</P><P>	Safe schools are another reason why good schools are a great investment.
