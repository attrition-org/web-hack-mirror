<OL>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Get a good anti-virus program and update it regularly.  Our school system has a district license for virus protection software.  It is being preloaded and setup on all new computers. Contact the tech support representative assigned to your school for more information.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Never ever double click on a file without virus checking it first. Email is text and cannot be a virus. A virus is an executable program. It is usually hidden in one of those cute little dancing baby type programs. Never open any attachment that ends in .exe or contains a macro unless you are 200% sure it is what you asked for. Friends often send viruses to friends unknowingly in cute things they got from other friends.  Best thing to do is trash ALL attachments unless they are information you have specifically asked someone to send you that you need to do your job.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Word has macros that can be placed in documents. Macros are executable programs. You do not know what they will do, so never run them.  You can set word to never run macros without permission.  Good suggestion, always say NO.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></OL>
