<font size=+2> <b>Education Matters:</font><br> <center><font size=+1> A Message from Richard Brooks <br><BR>
SCHOOL VOLUNTEERS INCREASE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT</b></font></center><BR><BR>
<BR><P>


What is the single most significant contribution made by the community to
public schools?  I think it's volunteer service.

<P>
	Volunteers contribute the extra, personalized help that enhances our
children's educational opportunities.  Each day in our school system,
mentors and other adult volunteers spend time with students by tutoring,
sharing a hobby or special interest, visiting for a lunch period, supporting
at a school related or community event, or simply by spending a little time
talking and caring.  We are proud that so many of the residents of Coweta
take the time to share their expertise and life experiences with our
students.  When asked what are the requirements for being a mentor, we like
to reply by saying that having a heart is more important than many other
tangible characteristics.
<P>
	For instance, we have many mentors who began working with a student in
elementary school, continued to spend time with the same student through
middle and high school, and even stayed in touch after graduation.
<P>
	Last year, more than 154 volunteers like those just mentioned devoted more
than 5600 hours to helping out in classrooms throughout Coweta County
Schools.  These volunteers provided one-on-one tutoring in classrooms,
helped students with research projects, chaperoned field trips, answered
phones, made copies of classroom materials, and helped monitor tests.  These
special people come from every walk of life and are of all ages.  Their
presence reinforces teachers' instruction and then goes farther to say that
somebody else cares, too.
<P>
	I believe that volunteers provide strong, fundamental support for education
in today's atmosphere of declining educational resources: help that is not
only needed but deeply appreciated by students and staff members.
<P>
	In addition, volunteers are our strongest advocates and the most credible.
They know exactly what we are trying to accomplish in our schools, and they
can and do relate our goals and successes to the larger community in a
highly effective way.  We are proud of their contribution, for it is highly
significant.
<P>
	If you are looking for the most rewarding job in your life, volunteer a
little time to the children in your community, in our schools.  If you are a
parent, contact your child's school or talk to your child's teacher about
volunteering in the classroom.  If you would specifically like to mentor a
student in our schools, contact Lillie Smith at 770-254-2826 for
information.  If you have special expertise in an area, be certain to share
that information.  It helps place volunteers in the most appropriate
setting.  If you have a preference for a type of volunteer work or grade
level, communicate that preference and be specific with the amount of time
you can devote.  If, then, you are ever unable to fulfill your commitment,
be sure to advise the school.  You are missed.  If your business would like
to officially partner with a school, contact Andy Denny at 770-254-2806.
<P>
	Volunteering by individuals and business partners continues to enhance
education and the quality of life in Coweta County.  These efforts by
selfless, caring people will result in success stories that will be measured
in terms of years and lifetimes.  Volunteering helps make good schools a
great investment.
<P>
