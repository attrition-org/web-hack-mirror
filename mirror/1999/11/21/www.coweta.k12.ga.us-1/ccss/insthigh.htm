<P><HR SIZE=5   WIDTH="100%"><I><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Alternative Scheduling:</FONT></B></I>

Beginning Fall 1998, high schools will use modified 4X4 block scheduling to maximize the use of time and enable students to meet enhanced graduation requirements while allowing sufficient time for electives in technology, fine arts, and other areas.  Newnan Crossing Elementary School has year-round education.  The traditional 180 day calendar is arranged into 45 days of instruction followed by 15 days of break (including an optional intercession).

At two elementary schools, Newnan Crossing and Western, students in grade K-5 have daily French lessons.  Coweta is a model for the state's elementary foreign language program.

<B><I><FONT SIZE=+2>Gifted Education:</FONT></I></B>


Classes are available for elementary, middle, and high school students who have been classified as talented/gifted.  Advanced placement courses in high school offer a seamless transition between high school and college.

<HR SIZE=5   WIDTH="100%">

<B><I><FONT SIZE=+2>Interactive Science Program:</FONT></I></B>


Elementary students enjoy the Full Option Sience System (FOSS) which features hands-on activities and kits for conduction experiments in class. 


<HR SIZE=5   WIDTH="100%">

<I><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Pre-kindergarten:</B></FONT></I>


Classes for four-year olds follow an educational approach which allows children to explore and learn by making decisions, solving problems, and thinking about what they are doing.
<HR SIZE=5   WIDTH="100%">

<B><I><FONT SIZE=+2>Technical Preparation:</FONT></I></B>


Coweta's high schools offer technical preparation programs in cooperation with area technical schools and colleges.  Tech Prep programs are based on a strong academic core and upgraded vocational courses, many of which integrate math, science, and computer applications. 

<HR SIZE=5   WIDTH="100%"><I><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Technology:</FONT></B></I>

Students in all grades are not only learning about technology, but also learning through the use of technology.  Students and teachers across the system are being linked to each other and to the Internet.  A number of schools are connected to partner schools in Scottland.  Coweta is a part of a multimillion dollar distance learning grant from the state department.<BR>
