<BR>
<HR>


<B>Question: Am I responsible for other teachers' students internet use if they are in my classroom?<BR>

<B>Question: Where can I get the steps to getting students licensed?<BR>
	Answer:</B><a href="access97.txt">Click here</a><BR><BR>
<B>Question: Do parents have to come to a meeting?<BR>
	Answer:</B> Not unless the school administration wants to require them to come.<BR><BR>
<B>Question: What about some suggested student rules?<BR>
	Answer:</B> <a HREF="rules.txt">Click here.</A><BR><BR>

<B>Question: What do I send home in the packets?<BR>
	Answer:</B> Send the letter from Gary and the parental approval/refusal form and any material from your individual school.  The Acceptable Use Policy forms (AUP) only go home to the parents who say yes.<BR><BR>
<B>Question: Where do I get Acceptable Use Policy forms?<BR>
	Answer:</B> From Carla Brown at Tech Support, but only after the parental approval/refusal forms have come back.  You will need one AUP form for each child whose parents said yes .<BR><BR>
<B>Question:  What do I do with the approval/refusal forms?<BR>
	Answer:</B>  They need to be filed in the permanent record.  A copy of every NO form needs to be sent to Carla Brown at Tech Support to be documented in the database.  A list of all students whose parents have said NO needs to be given to all teachers as soon as the forms are in.<BR><BR>
<B>Question: Can we contact parents who say No and talk to them about it?<BR>
	Answer:</B> Yes, just be polite, never argumentative.<BR><BR>
<B>Question:  Do we need to do parental informational sessions at all?<BR>
	Answer:</B> Yes, for those parents who requested more information.  You can plan one big meeting or set up conferences during the day.  Work out the best plan for you, just document it.<BR><BR>
<B>Question: Who trains the students on using the Internet?<BR>
	Answer:</B>  The teacher who is sponsoring the student does the training as they start using the Internet in their class project.  The Curriculum Technology Specialists (CTS) may help.   For  students who have no sponsoring teacher,  the CTS teacher can set up training before and/or after school.<BR><BR>
<B>Question: Where can I get rules?<BR>
	Answer:</B>  The CTS at each school has sample rule sheets developed by other teachers and copies of the laws and policies in force in Coweta County and Georgia.<BR><BR>
<B>Question:  My computer will not get the internet.  What do I do?<BR>
	Answer:</B> If it has been getting the internet in the past, have the CRT or tech assistant look at it to determine if it is a hardware/programming error.  They will either fix it or send a work order to tech support.  If it has never had internet, your CTS has the procedure form and IP request forms that need to be completed.<BR><BR>
<B>Question: What do I do with AUP forms?<BR>
	Answer:</B> They must be filled in completely.  The student ID number must be on the forms for the licenses to be issued.  Students and sponsoring teachers sign the forms after completing training. Completed forms should be turned into your CTS who will then forward them to Ann Elrod at Tech Support.  The licenses should be sent to you within a week of our receipt of the forms.<BR><BR>
<B>Question: Am I responsible for  my students internet use, even when they are in other classes?<BR>
	Answer:</B> No, you are responsible for training the students and giving them the rules.  That is what you agree to when you sign the forms.  The statement on the for says "I have read the Terms and Conditions and agree to promote this agreement with the student. Because the student may use the network for individual work or in the context of another class, I cannot be held responsible for the student's use of the network.  As the sponsoring teacher, I do agree to instruct the student on the acceptable use of the network and proper network etiquette".    This gives us a legal leg to stand on if problems arise from the "I didn't know" excuse.<BR><BR>
<B>Question: Do all my students have to have licenses if I use the internet in my class?<BR>
	Answer: </B>Not if you are doing it demonstration style and have previewed the sites to be sure you do not open an inappropriate site.  If the students are using it themselves, then the answer is yes.
