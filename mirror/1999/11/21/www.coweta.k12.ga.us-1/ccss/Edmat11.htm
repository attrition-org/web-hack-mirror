</FONT><P>&#9;We live in an era of comprehensive testing. Teachers test students with daily quizzes, chapter tests, benchmark tests, and unit or semester tests that measure what students have learned—or forgotten. Schools and school districts are using national tests to measure both achievement and aptitude not only of individual students, but entire grade levels, and to measure academic progress over time. States today are increasingly using tests for purposes of statewide accountability and, in some cases such as Georgia, as a standard that all students must meet in order to graduate from high school. And for the high school student considering college, the last three years of high school includes Saturday mornings taking PSAT, ACT, and SAT tests. That’s quite a bit of testing. What’s a student to do? More to my point, what’s a parent to do?</P>
<P>&#9;First of all, it is helpful to learn about the different types of tests administered to students—what they measure and why they are used. Our school system employs a number of effective ways of doing this including notices sent home from teachers, special brochures prepared by our testing coordinator, a television program discussing testing, and opportunities for questions at parent-teacher conferences. Coweta Schools’ Testing Coordinator Lillie Smith has information available regarding all the standardized tests administered in our system. She can be reached at 770-254-2826.</P>
<P>&#9;To help prepare your student for tests, follow a daily routine that provides consistent support. "A little every day" is the maxim to remember when studying for spelling tests, vocabulary quizzes, and tests over the periodic table, multiplication facts, and reading assignments. Encourage the habits and skills that help successful learning—set aside quiet time to review the day’s assignments. Read together and talk about what was learned that day at school. An evening meal together, a good night’s sleep, and time for a good breakfast make a difference, too. And see that time to study is not sacrificed for television or computer games.</P>
<P>&#9;Tests that matter the most, such as compulsory exams for high school graduation, or college entrance exams, or even a driver's license test require students to find sufficient motivation in themselves to do well. To assist them, teachers in our system offer review classes prior to advanced placement exams. Preparatory classes are also available for students taking college entrance exams. In addition, look for a series of television shows on our local cable stations regarding SAT information and preparation. And it is always appropriate for parents to suggest supplementary tutoring in a weak subject area.</P>
<P>&#9;The following is a summary of the ways you can help your child:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Build your child’s skills and confidence every day; then on test days, he or she will be more likely to have the resources needed to do his or her best. </LI>
<LI>Ask your student’s teacher about the purposes of different tests, how the results are used, and what specific things you can do to help. </LI>
<LI>Help your child overcome test anxiety by being available, listening, and encouraging.</LI></UL>

<P>&#9;The "Information Age" in which we are hurling ourselves headlong is a challenging, competitive, and wonderful world. It takes us all—teachers, students, and parents alike—to meet the challenge and continue to make Coweta County a place where good schools are a great investment.</P></BODY>
