<BR>
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Section 1.</B> Chapter 9 of Title 16 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to crimes involving forgery and fraudulent practices, is amended by repealing in its entirety Article 6, the "Georgia Computer Systems Protection Act," and inserting in its place a new Article 6 to read as follows:<BR>
<BR>
<B>ARTICLE 6<BR>
</B><BR>
</FONT><B>16-9-90</B>. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This article may be cited as the 'Georgia Computer Systems Protection Act.'<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B>16-9-91.</B> </P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>The General Assembly finds that:</P>
<P><BR>
<B>(1)</B> Computer related crime is a growing problem in the government and in the private sector;<BR>
<B>(2)</B> Such crime occurs at great cost to the public, since losses for each incident of computer crime tend to be far greater than the losses associated with each incident of other white collar crime;<BR>
<B>(3)</B> The opportunities for computer related crimes in state programs, and in other entities which operate within the state, through the introduction of fraudulent records into a computer system, unauthorized use of computer facilities, alteration or destruction of computerized information files, and stealing of financial instruments, data, or other assets are great;<BR>
<B>(4)</B> Computer related crime operations have a direct effect on state commerce;<BR>
<B>(5)</B> Liability for computer crimes should be imposed on all persons, as that term is defined in this title; and<BR>
<B>(6)</B> The prosecution of persons engaged in computer related crime is difficult under previously existing Georgia criminal statutes.<BR>
