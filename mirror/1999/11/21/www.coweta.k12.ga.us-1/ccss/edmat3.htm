<font size=+2> <b>Education Matters:</font><br> <center><font size=+1> A Message from Richard Brooks <br> End of School </b></font></center><BR><BR>
<BR><P>

As another school year closes for our students, it is appropriate to reflect on the accomplishments of this past year. This has been a time of tremendous growth as indicated by our current student enrollment of approximately 15,000 young people and the 750 new students we will add next fall. Expansion in our school facilities includes two new schools opening in the fall and classroom additions at Western Elementary School and Elm Street Elementary School. The FY99 school system budget will be over $100 million for the first time in our history.
<BR><BR>We are also growing in both the number and quality of our teachers who are so important in the lives of the children they work with each day. Administrators, faculty and staff members in our elementary, middle and high schools devote countless hours to helping their students both individually and collectively. We will welcome over 100 new teachers in the fall.
<BR><BR>With the ringing of the dismissal bell last Friday, some of our educators bid farewell to their last classes of students and began their retirement after many years of dedication to the young people of the county. We honor them and thank them for a job well done. 
<BR><BR>We congratulate the teachers who have just been selected by their peers to serve as the teacher of the year from each of our schools. Brenda Clifton, first grade teacher at Elm Street Elementary, is the 1998 Coweta Teacher of the Year. Last year's county winner, Andy Denny, (East Coweta High School) was one of four finalists from across the state considered for selection as the Georgia Teacher of the Year. That makes four Coweta teachers in the past five years who have been selected as finalists for that honor, including two who went on to become the state teacher of the year. We are proud of them all but especially Jamie Lipscomb who is just completing her year as the state's top teacher. <BR><BR>
We applaud the work of all of our teachers, administrators and support staff for the tremendous work they do each day. It takes over 1800 employees to provide safe, attractive schools where our students can grow physically, emotionally, socially, and intellectually.
<BR><BR>On behalf of our teachers, staff, and students, I thank the members of the Board of Education for their support, guidance, and encouragement through the year. Their countless hours of work enable them to make the best possible decisions as they set policies that form the framework for the school system. Board members volunteer their time since they receive no compensation for the monthly meetings or the many activities they attend around the school system. 
<BR><BR>
On behalf of the Board, the staff, and the students, I express appreciation to the parents, citizens, and members of the business community who support the school system with their finances, their time, and their energy. Mentors and business partners offer invaluable assistance to individual students, special programs, and schools.
<BR><BR>Finally, I wish our students a safe, happy summer. We look forward to seeing most of you return in the fall. To those who have graduated, I wish you continued success and hope you will agree that your experiences in Coweta's good schools have been a great investment.
