<P>The After School Program (ASP) will be offered at elementary schools
again this year.&nbsp; Initiated in 1988, the ASP is operated for the benefit
of the students and as a service to parents by providing a safe, structured
environment staffed by Coweta County School System personnel.&nbsp;

<P>Students may stay in the ASP from school dismissal until 6:00 p.m.&nbsp;
<BR>Teachers, teaching assistants, and cafeteria personnel offer a variety
of learning enrichment activities for the students.&nbsp; Homework sessions
are required daily, Monday through Thursday.&nbsp; Snacks are served, and
supervised recreational activities are provided each day.&nbsp; During
the 1998-1999 school year, an emphasis will be given to reading enhancement
with a silent reading period or a story time for the younger students.&nbsp;

<P>The cost of the program is $5.00 per child per day reserved when paid
during the week before the week of attendance.&nbsp; Tuition payments made
during the week of attendance are $7.00 per day reserved.&nbsp; A student
may maintain enrollment in the ASP by attending at least one day per week.&nbsp;

<P>Each ASP is managed by a site coordinator located at the school.&nbsp;
Site coordinators will be at the schools beginning August 10th and will
also register students during Orientation Day, August 12.&nbsp;

<P>You may obtain additional information from Herman Fletcher, ASP Coordinator,
at 770-254-2827.&nbsp;
