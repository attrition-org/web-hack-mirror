<font size=+2> <b>Education Matters:</font><br> <center><font size=+1> A Message from Richard Brooks <br> Block Scheduling </b></font></center><BR><BR>
<P>
	After two years of intensive study, which included parent meetings, site visits to schools using alternative scheduling, and training for staff members, the Board of Education decided this past January to implement block scheduling in our three high schools next fall.  There were a number of reasons for the decision.  The primary one being the constantly increasing graduation requirements set by the state board of education.  The traditional six-period school day is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of our students.</P>

 <P>      The decision was made to use a modified 4 X 4 block schedule.  This basically means that each student will take four 90 minute classes daily during each of two terms or semesters per year.  A term or semester consists of 90 days so the school year will still consist of 180 days. This will give students an opportunity to earn one Carnegie unit for each class for a total of eight units per year and a total of 32 units over a four-year period rather than the current 24 units.  This schedule will also provide additional opportunities for students to participate in advanced placement courses, work experiences, fine arts, courses in specific areas of interest, and technical training.</P>

<P>        The state now requires that students choose programs leading to a diploma with either a college prep or a tech/career prep seal.  In the spring of their eighth grade year, therefore, students select programs of study leading to preparation for their career goals.  These decisions are made with the assistance of their teachers, parents, and guidance counselors.  Block scheduling will allow for greater flexibility and modification in the program as students mature.</P>

<P>        Our three high schools are currently involved in the registration process.  Informational meetings for parents and students have been held at each of the schools to discuss block scheduling and the registration process.  Students have received career planning guides and registration packets to share with their parents in order to select courses for the upcoming year.   Registration was held during the past few days.  If you have questions or concerns about the program of study for your child, please don't hesitate to contact the guidance office at East Coweta, Newnan High, or Northgate.</P>


<P>        Change is always unsettling but let me assure you that our goal is to constantly seek ways to better meet the needs of all of the students of Coweta County.  Our administrative staff, counselors, and faculty will do everything possible to ensure a smooth transition for students as they enter high school and as they prepare for the challenges of the 21st century.  We believe that block scheduling will prove to be another reason why good schools are a great investment.
