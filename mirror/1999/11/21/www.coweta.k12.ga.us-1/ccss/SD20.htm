<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>&nbsp;SD200013 Interdisciplinary Approach to Authentic</B> <B>Science for Middle and Elementary Teachers</B>: The course uses the scientific method as a springboard to a variety of interdisciplinary lessons and activities. Science experiments that emphasize the collection and interpretation of data will be modeled by instructor(s) as a guide for similar development by participants. Activities are correlated to elementary and middle school QCC objectives in science, math, language arts, and social studies. Teachers are encouraged to become familiar and comfortable with scientific topics and concepts that may be extended into other disciplines. A network of participants will be established and maintained through e-mail and internet bulleting boards and synchronous chat sessions in order to continue to develop and share ideas and information throughout the school year.
