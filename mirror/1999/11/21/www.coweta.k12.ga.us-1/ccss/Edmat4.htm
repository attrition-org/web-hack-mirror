<font size=+2> <b>Education Matters:</font><br> <center><font size=+1> A Message from Richard Brooks <br> COMMUNICATION AND THE PARENT-SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP </b></font></center><BR><BR>
<BR><P>


Another school year is now underway as we opened the doors to more than 15,000 students on August thirteenth. As a group of sincerely caring
administrators, teachers, counselors, bus drivers, and custodial and nutrition staff, we thank you for your trust in us to safeguard and teach
your most precious assets: your children. As we make it our daily business to do our best with our students, we are ever mindful of the necessity of a
positive relationship with parents. One of our goals this year is to enhance communication between all facets of the school and home relationship.
<BR><BR>
Educators are parents, too. We know that the demands today's lifestyle places on families are unprecedented. We also know that our students'
success at school is dependent upon a high level of parental involvement.  There are only so many hours in a day, however, and with the number of
working parents in America exceeding 36 million, making participation at school easier and more convenient is vital. We are excited to tell you
about the various strategies we have developed to help your busy family make the most of the hours you have available.
<BR><BR>
We all agree that communication between home and school is a key factor in your student's success at school. Now, it is easy to "reach out and touch"
us at your convenience, simply by using our electronic mail services. In this way, we can respond quickly to your questions and concerns.
<BR><BR>
Our school system is also on line. You are welcome to visit our web site at www.coweta.k12.ga.us. We keep this site updated with timely information
concerning all our schools. The system also is fortunate enough to have a cable access channel provided by Newnan Utilities, Channel 7. This access
allows us to air videotaped programs, announcements of coming events, awards, and athletic activities information -- all of which can help you
plan your family's school related activities in advance.
<BR><BR>
In addition, "SchoolTalk," a phone-in service provided by The Newnan Times Herald, provides direct access to specific school, grade-level, and teacher
information. 
<BR><BR>
These technological advances, however, do not prohibit you from visiting our schools in person or from telephoning us with a question or concern. We
welcome your interaction with us so that we may all work together to better educate our students.
<BR><BR>
As school superintendent, I expect no less than the best efforts of all our employees. We take our responsibilities to you and your family quite
seriously. I encourage you as parents to expect the same level of performance from your students. Know your students' teachers and schedule
and ask your young person frequent questions about what is going on in regard to school responsibilities. Ask about homework, class activities,
projects, tests, and other areas of concern. Above all, encourage your student to be absent from school as little as possible. Good attendance is
the first step toward effective school performance. Please do all you can to stay abreast of your student's attendance record and to assist in
maintaining excellent attendance.
<BR><BR>
As we embark upon another school year, let's do all we can to enhance communication between two of the most important aspects of a young person's
life: home and school. This will help ensure a better future for us all in Coweta County, where good schools are a great investment.
