<font size=+2> <b>Education Matters:</font><br> <center><font size=+1> A Message from Richard Brooks <br><BR>
The Essence of Communication </b></font></center><BR><BR>
<BR><P>



	A researcher whose name has long been forgotten once noted that, "Most
problems are communication problems."  I tend to agree.  That is why one
area in which our school system is focusing this year is communication.  It
is both amazing and reassuring to realize how many problems can be solved
once the major players are brought to the table for positive discussion.
Just as teachers are expected to communicate effectively with parents as
part of their job, I encourage parents to establish effective avenues of
communication with the school. Communication works best when the parties
remember a few essential considerations: timeliness, accuracy, and care.  
      <P>  First of all, time is of the essence when dealing with most
student-related issues.  Teachers should initiate timely communication in
the form of notes, letters, and phone calls to parents regarding matters of
students' academic performance, punctuality, attendance, and attitude.
Administrators are expected to initiate timely notices regarding school
activities.  Parents should expect this and never have to say, "I wish I had
known."  At the same time, parents are encouraged to notify schools promptly
when anything occurs in a student's life which could impact his achievement
or school demeanor.  Many times, school personnel are aware of appropriate
resources to help students through difficult times stemming from a variety
of sources.  Medical and attendance concerns should always be communicated
to the school as soon as possible.  Again, early intervention gets better
results than most hurried, last minute attempts.
  <P>        Second, communication works best when it is clear, specific, and
accurate.  Teachers and parents should never hesitate to verify questionable
information.  When a school official calls home to verify a note, it is not
a matter of distrust; it is usually an effort to protect our students and
ourselves from miscommunication which could lead to any one of several
misfortunate occurrences.  Direct notes, e-mails, and phone calls between
teachers and parents are proven ways to keep students tuned to the
essentials for effective school life: punctuality, regular attendance, and
hard work.  We should never take offense when a parent or teacher calls to
say, "I just wanted to make sure."  High school teachers prepare course
information on a nine-week basis.  Middle school teachers send handouts and
newsletters home.  Elementary teachers prepare daily and weekly feedback to
parents.  Parents are encouraged to look for these items.  Ask your students
about them and call the teacher if necessary.  In addition, most problems
are best solved at the most immediate level of interaction.  That means the
teacher is usually the first person a parent should contact when concerned
about classroom performance.  It is the teacher who knows the student and
the situation best.  
  <P>        Third, effective communication should occur as a result of caring
about our parental and educational responsibilities.  Even conflict comes
from caring.  There are always going to be times when it is hard for a
parent and teacher or administrator to agree.  At those times it is best to
pause for a moment and always consider what is best for the student.  I
believe that if we truly want what is best for our students, then as parents
and educators we will make the best decision together most of the time.
This requires regular, factual communication designed to build a lasting
bridge between home and school, a bridge that will carry us all effectively
into the relationships that are best for our purpose of educating our young
people. 
   <P>       Effective communication between school and home is just one of many
factors helping to make Coweta County a place where good schools are a great
investment.
