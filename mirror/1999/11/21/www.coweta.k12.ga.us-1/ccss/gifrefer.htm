<P>A teacher, counselor, administrator, parent/guardian, or the student him/herself can make a referral. Parents may request a <B><I>Student Referral for Consideration </B></I>form in the office at each school during the month of October. The <B><I>Student Referral for</B></I> <B><I>Consideration</B></I> forms must be returned to the teacher of gifted at the school by October 31 for students in grades 3 – 12 and January 31 for grades K - 2. </P>
<P>To be eligible for gifted program services, a student must meet specific levels of superior performance in the areas of mental ability, achievement, creativity, and motivation as measured by standardized, school system-administered evaluation instruments.</P>
<P>Many students were referred, considered and found not eligible during the1998 – 99 school year. System staff will begin automatically reconsidering these students’ achievement data in September 1999 for eligibility. If any other testing is needed for these reconsidered students, their parents will be notified.</P>
<P>If you have any questions regarding the referral or eligibility procedures for the gifted education program in Coweta County Schools, please contact the designated Teacher of Gifted in your student’s school. </P>
