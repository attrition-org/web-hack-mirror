<hr>

<p><font size="3">Using the information found at the Project
Evaluation Site at UGA, </font><a
href="http://itech1.coe.uga.edu/ITevaluation/"><font size="3">http://itech1.coe.uga.edu/ITevaluation/</font></a><font
size="3"> along with consultants from the State University of
West Georgia, we have formulated the following initial project
evaluation design. Once the project is underway, the Evaluation
Site will be a useful resource for models and techniques to be
employed.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Project Design:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The purpose of the evaluation is to describe
the program at each of the three schools, assess program
implementations, and to provide recommendations for program
improvement. As such, the design is a formative or process
evaluation which offers immediate response to participant needs.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The evaluation is facilitated through classroom
observations and site visits, perception data gathered through
interviews and questionnaires, and through data obtained from
school records, such as that used in the selection of project
schools.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Questions addressed in the evaluation
for each school are:</strong></font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="3">Is the program implemented as detailed in
        the goals set forth in section 3a of the proposal:</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Achievement goals include implementing</font></li>

        program</font></li>

        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p><font size="3"><strong>What are parent, teacher, school
leadership, and student perceptions about the attitudes toward
the program? Determine the relationship between attitudes and
involvement:</strong></font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="3">correlate attitudes and student attendance
        and discipline</font></li>

<ol>
    <li><font size="3">continuity of the proficiency of a school
        to attract and keep students from on year to the next</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font size="3">A goal of the evaluation design is to provide
useful information at various stages of program implementation to
each school thereby facilitating accountability and program
improvement. Available results of the evaluation will be
disseminated to participants through monthly email presentations
and discussions. A formal report will be written at the end of
the evaluation year which includes recommendations for change and
improvement.</font></p>
