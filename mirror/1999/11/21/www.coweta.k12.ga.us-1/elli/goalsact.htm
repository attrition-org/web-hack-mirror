<h2 align="center"><a name="index">Goals and Activities</a></h2>

<hr>

<p><font size="3">For this grant we have formulated the following
goals which not only address the President&#146;s four goals, but
also the local goals of Coweta County. Cross referenced. (The
President&#146;s four goals and the goals of our Five Year Plan
). </font></p>

<p><a name="#1"><font size="3"><strong>1) To increase student
performance in reading and writing by means of the use of
effective and engaging software and on-line resources integrated
into the school&#146;s curriculum. (Presidential goal #4; Five
yr. plan goal #5)</strong></font></a></p>

<p><a name="#2"><font size="3"><strong>2) To train teachers and
staff in all three levels of the Georgia Framework for Technology
Professional Development and specifically in integrating
technology into the language arts curriculum to enhance reading
and writing skills. (Presidential goal #1; Five yr. plan goal #6)</strong></font></a></p>

<p><a name="#3"><font size="3"><strong>3) To include parents and
community members as an integral part of the instructional
process. (Five yr. plan goal #3)</strong></font></a></p>

<p><a name="#4"><font size="3"><strong>4) To complete current
plans aimed towards providing all students, teachers and staff
with modern technology and access to the Internet. (Presidential
goals #2,3; Five yr. plan goal #1,2)</strong></font></a></p>

<p><a name="#5"><font size="3"><strong>5) To provide for the
needs of special students such as handicapped and ESOL by
selecting resources that allow for needed accommodations. (Five
yr. plan goal #2)</strong></font></a></p>

<hr>

<p><a href="goalsact.htm#1"><font size="3"><strong>Action plans
for goal #1: </strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong>To
increase student performance in reading and writing by means of
the use of effective and engaging software and on-line resources
integrated into the school&#146;s curriculum.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Our system has been involved in a curriculum
alignment process for almost 2 years now. Most recently, the
alignment of the language arts curriculum K-12 was completed and
a new textbook series adopted. The technology integration
component of that alignment process is found among the activities
in this section; and in particular, in addressing the special
needs of the youngest children.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #1:</strong> As part of the
system&#146;s adoption of a new reading program and language arts
curriculum alignment process, re-evaluate outdated Writing to
Read (WTR) program and implement up-dated version or equivalent
for grades K-1.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The current WTR program is almost 10 years old
and not being used effectively. Current software offerings in
this area will be evaluated by a team from the State University
of West Georgia reading specialists and Coweta County Schools
curriculum staff to decide which package best fits into the newly
aligned curriculum. For budgeting purposes, Writing to Read 2000
is assumed to be the follow-up program.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #2</strong>: Continue with
Title I plans in place to implement reading literacy software
activities for Fall 1997 implemenation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ruth Hill: Failure Free Reading program</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Aktinson: Writing Lab</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Newnan Crossing: Writing Lab</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #3:</strong> Evaluate and
implement appropriate &quot;reading readiness&quot; software in
pre-K program at the 3 project schools.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In addition to evaluating and purchasing
commercial educational software, software will be developed using
the techniques and materials of the Progress reading program by
Dr. Elaine Roberts of the State University of West Georgia.
Although initial focus for this program would be the pre-K area,
it could also be used in the K-2 grouping.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #4:</strong> Include private
pre-K programs in the software evaluation and selection process
and investigate group, or community licensing agreements.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Through wide-area community network
connections, project software and on-line resources can be shared
not only with the pre-K programs in our public system, but also
at private programs as well. We feel this is an important
component since many of the private programs do not have the
resources or staff that are found in the public school offerings.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #5:</strong> Evaluate and
implement a follow-up program for WTR (or equivalent) for grade
2.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Grades 2-5 will need appropriate software to
continue the reinforcement and enrichment of language arts
skills.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #6:</strong> Establish a
project server/web site for sharing on-line resources such as
student tutorials.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A project server will be setup up with a web
site established. Courseware could also be delivered to home or
Community Access Centers where students could &quot;do
homework&quot; and act as a &quot;mentor&quot; for parents
needing training in going &quot;on-line&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #7:</strong> Expand
intercession offerings at Newnan Crossing year-round school to
include technology enrichment activities for PK-2 students in
language arts literacy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We feel that that intercession training can
make a big difference in keeping students on-track with
developing language arts skills. Much of 1997 Next Generation
Schools grant funding will go to this purpose as well.</font></p>

<p><a href="goalsact.htm#index"><font size="3">Goals and
Activities Index</font></a></p>

<hr>

<p><a href="goalsact.htm#2"><font size="3"><strong>Action plans
for goal #2:</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong> To train
teachers and staff in all three levels of the Georgia Framework
for Technology Professional Development and specifically in
integrating technology into the language arts curriculum to
enhance reading and writing skills.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Technical support and training are critical to
the success of any technology program. We feel we are making big
strides in building that support infrastructure here in our
system. To that end, we will be filling 10 new school-based
positions of Curriculum/Technology Specialist new year. Each
person be itinerant and serve 2 schools. These are in addition to
the 2 central-office-based staff already doing training and
working in technology curriculum integration. These new staff are
also joined by 7 central-office-based technicians and, in the
elementary schools, 1/2 time itinerant technicians. In all, 28
personnel are directly involved in the support of technology. The
systems&#146; Five Year Plan calls for a full time dedicated
technician and curriculum specialist for every school. We are
almost half way to that goal now.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In addition to these internal system resources,
many other training resources are available, including:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="3">State University of West Georgia,
        Carrollton</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">State University of West Georgia, Newnan
        (Shenandoah) Center</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Georgia Youth Science and Technology
        Center</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Kennesaw DOE Technology Training Center</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3">With all these resources available, we feel
that we have the training support infrastructure in place that
will make these activities succeed.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #1:</strong> As a
&quot;co-requisite&quot; for the &quot;roll out&quot; of new
workstations for every classroom, train each teacher in Level 1
competencies by the end of the 1997-98 school year.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A variety of techniques will be employed to
provide the training necessary for success of this component. Key
use will be made of the Curriculum/Technology Specialist in a
&quot;trainer of trainers&quot; type approach. Additionally,
technology itself will be employed a great deal as well in such
project components as the wide-area network-accessible CD-ROM
training server.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #2:</strong> Train teachers on
the new reading arts textbook adoption and it&#146;s associated
technology.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This will be done through plans already in
place through regular staff development funding</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #3:</strong> Train teachers on
pre-K &quot;reading readiness&quot; programs</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Newnan Crossing teachers can receive training
during Winter Intercession, while Ruth Hill and Atkinson teachers
will use a combination of planning days and in-school training.
Private pre-K schools will also be involved in sending their
staff to these sessions.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #4:</strong> Train teachers on
the follow-up to WTR, or equivalent</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Provide appropriate training for implementation</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #5: </strong>Train teachers
and staff on the use of project web site and server</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Every project member will have an email address
and access to the resources found at this, and other, Internet
sites.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #6:</strong> Train the new
Curriculum/Technology Specialists in the curriculum integration
aspects of the project.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The role of this new position will be to
integrate curriculum, technology and training needs at the
individual school level. They will take direction from the
Curriculum Department&#146;s alignment process, but will reside
in the Department of Technical Support, and also coordinate
closely with the Director of Staff Development. Each person is
assigned two schools, with 6 staff covering elementary schools
and 4 staff devoted to middle/high schools.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The schedule of these staff members is: Monday
and Wednesday at one school, Tuesday and Thursday at their other
school, and Friday they come to the central office or other
location for training. That means that 20% of their time is spent
in staff development activities. We feel that these staff members
will play an important role in providing accessible, school-based
training for project teachers and staff.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #7:</strong> Train existing
Technology Assistants in the technical support needed for the
project&#146;s success.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">These staff are responsible (along with central
office technicians) for the installation and maintenance of
hardware, software and networking systems at a school site. They
will work closely with the Curriculum/Technology Specialist
assigned to that school. The schedule of these staff members is
the same as for the Curriculum/Technology Specialists. They also
spend 20% of their time in training activities.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #8:</strong> Bring centralized
CD-ROM training server on-line.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A stand-alone fast-access CD-ROM server will be
installed at the Tech Support offices and training courses will
be offered over the wide-area fiber optic network.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #9:</strong> Implement
&quot;Readingline&quot; type project for reading</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Modeled after the &quot;Mathline&quot; project
that PBS sponsored, this training approach will use the school
system&#146;s cable TV channel, in conjunction with a listserv
bulletin board, to provide training programs and follow-up
discussion.</font></p>

<p><a href="goalsact.htm#index"><font size="3">Goals and
Activities Index</font></a></p>

<hr>

<p><a href="goalsact.htm#3"><font size="3"><strong>Action plans
for goal #3</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong>: To
include parents and community members as an integral part of the
instructional process.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The research shows that the home and community
environment is so important when it comes to trying to teach and
reinforce early literacy skills. These activities address that
need.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #1:</strong> Make adult
literacy training available to all parents and mentors who need
it</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It has become known among educators that the
best way to have a child who can read is to have a parent who can
read. Therefore, an important aspect of the project will be the
building of collaboratives to increase the literacy rate in our
county.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Work with committee formed through the Chamber
of Commerce to institute a Certified Literate Community program
in our county. Share resources when possible.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Work with Shenandoah Center and sponsoring
partners to provide Plato on-line tutorials to parents at home,
at work, or in Community Access Centers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #2:</strong> Provide training
to parents and mentors on teaching literacy to their children</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Use the school system&#146;s cable TV resources
to help deliver home or community accessible instruction.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Work with programs such as those at the Bonnell
Corporation which bring the training to the workplace. Here, a
business/education partnership goes on-site, through employee
release time, and delivers literacy and parenting training.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #3:</strong> Setup
&quot;community access server&quot; to provide on-line literacy
tutorials and other project related resources.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This would be the same physical server
referenced in goal 1, activity 5. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The project server functions in this area will
include: </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Email for students, parents, teachers, mentors
and staff</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Literacy tutorials</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Project web site offerings</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Bulletin board postings for various project or
community groups</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #4:</strong> Establish
&quot;Community Access Centers&quot; (CAC)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Research also shows that if we are going to be
successful with involving the parents and community mentors, then
we need to bring the technology to them. These centers would
consist of a thin client workstation connected over the wide-area
community network to the project applications server. Access
would be controlled by user id with training and support provided
by community mentors, as available.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This initiate will work through several of the
community partnerships established, especially CAAT. Proposed
pilot locations are in housing project offices, the county
library, area church community centers, and child care centers
serving pre-K programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #5:</strong> Provide parental
training during intercessions at Newnan Crossing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Promote the training of parents and students in
a shared environment. Each gets what&#146;s appropriate for their
needs from a selection of training offerings.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #6:</strong> Support
&quot;24-hour access/Training Center&quot; concept at Shenandoah
Center</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This facility will be a resource for community
training needs as well a source for on-line Plato literacy
software training.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #7:</strong> Support Bonnell
Co. on-site employee training program</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This local industry is highly supportive of
allowing school system personnel to be involved at the work site
with employee training. They receive training not only in their
personal literacy needs, but also in parenting skills as they
relate to helping their children succeed as well. Many parents
from the Ruth Hill attendance area work at this facility.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #8:</strong> Promote awareness
of the project in the homes and community</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Use the following community resources to
publicize the project:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Newnan Times-Herald newspaper, cable TV channel
and web site</font></p>

<p><font size="3">School system&#146;s cable TV channel</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Project and related web sites</font></p>

<p><font size="3">School-home communications</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Open house&quot; type activities</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #9:</strong> Work with
&quot;Stepping Stones&quot; project to involve parents from birth</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This program, which has been in place in our
county for 5 years, visits new born parents in the hospital and
shares information about the child&#146;s early development
needs. Recent research on brain development can be included to
emphasize the importance of proper environment and stimulation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #10: </strong>Promote regular
parental conferences and communications</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Work with business partnerships to provide work
release time for parents </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Provide email access for parent/teacher
communications at home or at Community Access Centers</font></p>

<p><a href="goalsact.htm#4"><font size="3"><strong>Action plans
for goal #4:</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong> To
complete current plans aimed towards providing all students,
teachers and staff with modern technology and access to the
Internet.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">We have been working on building the technology
infrastructure in our county for several years now. All of our
schools have been wired for LAN connectivity and our wide-area
network is more than half way completed. As one of the technology
components of the recently passed Local Option Sales Tax, a new
multimedia workstation will be purchased for every classroom in
every school in the system. Most of those will be installed this
next school year.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #1:</strong>
&quot;Roll-out&quot; a new workstation for every PK-2 classroom</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A new multimedia workstation with printer and
external display interface will be purchased with sales tax
revenues. The installation and training for same will be done in
stages, starting with PK and going up a grade at a time during
the course of the year. Co-requisite training will be provided
before, during and after installation. Initial goal will be to
have all classroom and support staff on-line with mandantory
email access.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #2:</strong> Complete Local
Area Network (LAN) wiring in every classroom, including special
education classes</font></p>

<p><font size="3">All three project schools have been wired for
10baseT connectivity and each has a file server with numerous
media center and classroom workstations on-line. However, there
are some miscellaneous wiring needed at each site to insure that
every student and staff member can have easy accessibility to all
school-based on-line resources. Wireless technology will be
employed to connect mobile units.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #3:</strong> Complete Wide
Area Network (WAN) connection (Newnan Crossing only)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This is the only 1 of the 3 project schools
that is not currently on the fiber optic WAN. This connection is
planned to be made in early fall of this year. An alternative
Internet connection will be provided in the interim for this
site.</font></p>

<p><a href="goalsact.htm#5"><font size="3"><strong>Action plans
for goal #5:</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong> To
provide for the needs of special students such as handicapped and
ESOL by selecting resources that allow for such accommodations.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">One of the areas in which technology can show a
significant impact is in the ability to allow for differences in
learning styles and abilities. That is why we have included it as
a major goal for the project.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #1:</strong> Include special
education and ESOL representatives in technology planning
committee meetings</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This is done through meetings of the
school&#146;s improvement committees</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #2: </strong>Make available
adaptive devices to any student who may require them </font></p>

<p><font size="3">to participate in the project.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Survey the school special education population
at all schools to identify and provide services for any students
so indenified.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Activity #3:</strong> Give preference
to multi-lingual software when available.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Part of what the brain research tells us is
that the earlier a child is exposed to as wide a variety of
phonemes as possible, the easier it will be for that child to
learn a foreign language then, or later in life. Therefore, this
approach to software devopment not only addresses the needs of
the ESOL students, but also performs the &quot;brain
building&quot; function of exposing students to a richer source
of language patterns and phoneme content.</font></p>
