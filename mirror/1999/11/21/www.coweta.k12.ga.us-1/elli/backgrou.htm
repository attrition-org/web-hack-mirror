<h2 align="center">Background and Research for Project
&quot;ELLI&quot;</h2>

<hr>

<p><font size="3"><strong>What are the issues?</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Educators have intuitively known for years how
important a child&#146;s early years were to future learning and
success in life. It goes without saying that some of the most
important skills that a child needs to learn during this period
of time deal with language literacy. We now know, through modern
research techniques, that literacy is a developmental process.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Literacy development begins at conception and
continues through fetal growth and maturity, into infancy,
childhood, preadolescence, adolescence, and adulthood. It is,
indeed, a life-long learning process which in itself is basic to
the process of life-long learning. Educational systems must focus
on this process using what is known (and is being learned each
day) about how this intricate, complex, human behavior is
mastered.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Until recently, efforts to examine this
uniquely human phenomenon were limited to externally studying
literacy related behavior with the hope of somehow 'intuiting'
what was going on inside the mind of the learner. Many of those
'educated guesses' were on target...many were not. Technological
accomplishments in imaging techniques over the last 10 years or
so have made it possible to begin to remove some of the guesswork
from educators&#146; efforts to understand how humans grow and
develop in general, and acquire literacy in particular.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Over recent years the imaging processes of MRI
and PET scan have given growth and development specialists and
literacy development researchers a whole new way of looking at
the center of this development - the brain. What has resulted is
a veritable revolution in what is known about how the three-pint,
three-pound, multi-function processor actually does what it
does...including acquiring literacy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Keeping in mind that what is known about brain
development and literacy acquisition is just beginning to grow,
it is safe to say that we now have some pretty significant ideas
to work with in thinking about exactly how, beginning with early
cellular clusters through language competence, the brain goes
about becoming literate. Some of the most important of those
ideas are:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">1. The fetus begins literacy acquisition while
in the womb. In addition to careful prenatal care, mothers-to-be
need to be exposed to lots of language in many different
environments prior to their child's birth. The fetus can, and
does, hear and learn from these experiences.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">2. Experience is the key stimulant for
literacy. The wider and more in-depth the life experiences of the
child, the wider and more in-depth will be the ability of the
brain to internalize, acquire and use literacy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">3. The brain is a parallel processor and, as
such, prefers multi-sensory activities and experiences which it
can use to develop alternate pathways for dealing with literacy
acquisition. The child must &quot;do&quot; language in lots of
different settings for lots of different purposes to accomplish a
variety of different real-life tasks.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">School programs which set literacy development
and acquisition as their top priority must make certain that
their programs are based on the latest available neurological
data; have teachers who are trained and knowledgeable in how the
brain develops and how to translate that into classroom activity;
and are leading parents (and the community in general) to a
better understanding of the importance of home and community
environment on the development of the child.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The importance of these recent findings was
emphasized earlier this year at the April 17th </font><a
href="http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/ECI/session1.html"><font
size="3">&quot;White House Conference on Early Childhood
Development and Learning: What New Research on the Brain Tells Us
about Our Youngest Children&quot;.</font></a></p>

<p><font size="3">At that conference Dr. Carla Shatz of the
University of California, Berkeley spoke of how the brain is
dynamically wiring itself as the child grows. She related that
the wiring of neuron connections takes place at a staggering rate
in the first months of life and doesn&#146;t slow down for years
to come.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Also presenting was Dr. Deborah Phillips of the
Institute of Medicine, Washington, DC who spoke about the
importance of the early care giver&#146;s role in providing a
stimulating environment for the child and how unfortunate it is
that we don&#146;t pay and train child care workers better.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">What does all of this mean for our educational
system? </font></p>

<p><font size="3">It means that, more than ever, we need to be
concerned about the environment and stimulation that a child
receives in the formative years. It means that we have to develop
strategies for dealing with the brain damaging effect of
&quot;crack babies&quot; on our teaching process. And it means
that we need made more aware of &quot;brain building
activities&quot; as we develop our elementary and preschool
curriculum.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Rationale and Vision</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">How can technology address the consequences of
this knowledge? </font></p>

<p><font size="3">It is no coincidence that technology can not
only provide the research on what should be done, but also help
provide the solutions. We envision several areas in which this
would take place:</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="3">In the diagnosing, prescribing and
        tracking of student progress</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">In the use of instructional and enrichment
        software systems</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">As a communications and training medium
        for parents and teachers</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font size="3">Why is Coweta County the place to fund such a
project?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We have a history of innovation that lends
itself towards trying some of the new strategies suggested in our
proposal. Some recent examples are:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Coweta County was awarded a Next Generation
Schools Grant in 1994 and it was recently announced that it has
again been awarded a grant for 1997. The goals of our 1997 grant
support many of the same objectives as this proposal, and which
are also in line with our long range technology and curriculum
goals. The goals in this grant were not &quot;made up&quot; for
the purpose of applying for the funding, but rather focus on some
of those already in place and being implemented.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We have been involved in a curriculum alignment
project for almost two years now and have completed alignment
efforts in language arts, reading, math and PE We feel this will
make a significant impact on our ability to teach and monitor
student progress through the required curriculum objectives for
all students in grades PK-12.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This past school year we implemented the 2nd
year-round school in the state at Newnan Crossing Elementary. We
feel that this alternative calendar will make a big difference in
student achievement in years to come.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Every system thinks to some degree or another
that they have excellent staff employed, and we are no exception.
It is reinforcing to have that feeling recognized externally,
however, and we are proud of the fact that over that last 5
years, 2 State Teachers of the Year, including the current, have
come from Coweta County. One of those is employed as a lead
teacher at one of the project schools.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We are benefiting from a number of productive
community partnerships and the resources they bring. An
outstanding example is the partnership group, the Coweta
Association for the Advancement of Technology (CAAT). Some
accomplishments of that organization have been:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">With the help of such partners as Newnan Water
and Light, the school system has build a wide-area fiber optic
network which is almost near completion. Due to very generious
donations of time and materials by several partners involved,
little resources were required by the system to accompish this.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">An outcome of a partnership between CAAT and
its sister group the West Georgia Telecommunications Alliance
(WGTA), based in Carrollton, is a sharing of network resources
that allows Coweta County&#146;s T1 PeachNet connection to
originate at the University of West Georgia in Carrollton and
transverse four interconnected Intranets in order to feed the
school system&#146;s wide area network with an Internet
connection.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The CAAT group also supported West Georgia
RESA&#146;s Model Technology Grant (largest awarded in Georgia),
in which Coweta County has a project school doing distance
learning activities over a multi-county fiber optic network.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As part of Newnan Water and Light&#146;s
entrance into the cable TV business, the school system has
received a dedicated cable TV channel and access to that
company&#146;s production facilities.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Another reason Coweta County is in a state of
readiness to go forward with this grant is seen in the commitment
by the board of education to support technology staffing. The
central-office-based Department of Technical Support currently
has 7 technicians and 2 system-wide Curriculum/Technology
Coordinators devoted to supporting technology at all system
locations. In addition, 7 departmental technicians are itinerant
and based in elementary schools. Also, currently being hired for
next year, are 10 new Curriculum/Technology Specialists who will
be itinerant and school-based as well. In all, with other support
staff, 28 people are employed in the department to support
technology use in all its phases. There is no other system our
size in the state that is staffed for technology support at this
committed a level.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In summary, then, we are in a definite state of
readiness to implement the goals of our proposal.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Project Overview</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The goals of this proposal fit well into the
long range curriculum and technology plans for our system that
are already in place. And even though we knew that our
system-wide &quot;at-risk&quot; figures wouldn&#146;t earn us any
bonus points in the award process, we do feel that the priorities
we have chosen for implementing our system goals are consistent
with the intent of focusing on the target groups specified in the
grant.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We, therefore, looked at system-wide data to
see which schools would fit best into the three
&quot;at-risk&quot; criterion. Some of the proposed data elements
used in the project are:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="3">1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade ITBS
        reading scores </font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Attendance data </font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Free/Reduced lunch percentage</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Discipline records</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Parental involvement figures</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3">After analysis of the statistical trends, focus
groups for the project were chosen to be students in grades PK-2
in our three school-wide Title I schools: Newnan Crossing
Elementary, Atkinson Elementary and Ruth Hill Elementary. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Examples of the type data that led us to choose
this cluster grouping can be found in the 1995-96 DOE report
card:</font></p>

</center></div>

<p><font size="3">Another group that will play a significant role
and be included in training and implementation will be private
pre-K providers. Parental contact and involvement through
technology plays a major role as well.</font></p>
