</span>Section 1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><u>The Year 2000
Problem</u>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Year 2000 Problem,
also known as Y2K or the millennium bug, resulted from a method used by computer
programmers to save storage space that reflect the year in a program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Many computers only have fields for the last two digits to represent the
year, assuming the first two digits are (19), e.g. this year is &quot;99&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When the century changes to 2000, the same computers will read
&quot;00&quot; and assume the year to be 1900.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Further complicating the problem is the fact that the year 2000 is a leap
year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One can imagine the problems
this could cause with computerized calculation such as graduation dates or
interest calculation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition
to desk top computers, this problem could affect networks, software, the
computer chips, thermostats, alarm systems, elevators and other devices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Systems that are not repaired in advance of the new millennium could
experience significant problems ranging from total meltdown to minor hiccup to
the worst case scenario of appearing to have no problem while actually producing
flawed data.</span></p>

</span>Section 2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Y2K Committee</u>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Individualized Departments within the Cherokee County School System have
been working since August of 1997 identifying, updating and testing the System
critical computer function as well as corresponding with third party vendors and
suppliers in order to minimize the effects of the Y2K problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One of Dr. Frank Petruzielo's first actions after taking charge of the
Cherokee County School System in February of 1999 was to establish an Ad Hoc Y2K
Committee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This Committee
co-chaired by Candler Howell, Assistant Superintendent of Financial Management,
and Jackie Hopkins, Assistant Superintendent of Accountability, Technology and
Strategic Planning, and staffed by System personnel and consultants has
marshalled, analyzed and reviewed the System's substantial prior efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Committee continues to work pro-actively in order to minimize the
effects of the Y2K problem.</span></p>

</span>Section 3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><u>In House
Computer Hardware and Software Assessment</u>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This Committee has conducted a comprehensive system wide inventory and
identified date-sensitive critical computer functions within the system, as well
as other date system computer functions whose operation has not been deemed to
be critical.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%;mso-hyphenate:
none;tab-stops:-.5in"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 3.1<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Critical Functions</u>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With respect to the aforesaid critical functions, the Committee required
the upgrading of all hardware and software to computer components which are
represented by their manufacturers to be &quot;Y2K compliant&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Where possible, the Committee required in-house testing of all critical
computer functions by &quot;forcing&quot; all mission critical date sensitive
programs forward in time to at least March, 2000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus far, certain time sensitive computer functions may not be tested in-
house and the system has, therefore, relied upon representation of the system
manufacturers and testing data provided.</span></p>

</span>Section 3.2<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Noncritical Functions</u>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>To a lesser extent, the Committee has required all non-critical date
sensitive computer functions to be updated where practicable and cost-effective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, minor interruption in non-critical system computer functions
could be experienced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
anticipated that these interruptions in service will in no way materially impact
the System's primary function, the education of the youth of Cherokee County.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%;mso-hyphenate:

</span>Section 4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Third Party
Vendors/Suppliers</u>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Committee has also identified and inventoried all System vendors and has
corresponded with each requesting a statement of Y2K compliance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Of the vendors contacted, the Committee has identified the top ten
critical vendors and entered dialogues with each regarding the provision of
continued service to the Cherokee County School System and has where required
created contingency plans to identify potential interruptions in service prior
to the conclusion of Christmas holidays and the students subsequent return on
January 3, 2000.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%;mso-hyphenate:
none;tab-stops:-.5in"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At present, based upon the ongoing dialogue with System vendors and
suppliers, it is anticipated that the Cherokee County School System will not
experience any critical interference with third party services which would
require the closing of schools.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>However, because the compliance of the critical third party
providers is totally outside the control of the Committee and the Cherokee
County School System, some interruption in school may be possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Parents are encouraged to monitor local media for potential adjustments
to the school calendar.</span></p>

</span>Section 5. <u>Contingency Planning</u>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the unlikely event of interruption in service of a critical system
provider, the Committee has developed contingency plans, including but not
limited to stocking of additional food and water in all school buildings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>All such contingency plans put the safety of the students first and all
other concerns second.</span></p>
