<p align="center">We warned you once, even gave you a links to
information and patches, looks like you tried to fix it, you just
didn't do it right, first time we were nice, left a note, and
sent an e-mail, problems didn't get fixed, so now you get owned.
Your page says you offer the worlds best IT certification
training. If this is the world's best, I feel sorry for the IT
employees'. You offer a Two Day $695 class on your website to
protect against this sort of thing. Looks like you need to take
it over.</p>
