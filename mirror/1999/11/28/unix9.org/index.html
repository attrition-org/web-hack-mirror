<p>Some people thought I was dead,</p>
<p>Some people thought I would never be seen again,</p>
<p>You have to realize, I am the shadow in the darkness,</p>
<p>I cannot be seen by the naked eye,</p>
<p>I am Da Eternal, I tell you no lie.</p>
<br>
<p>They say OpenBSD is secure,</p>
<p>Well I have found a rabbit hole,</p>
<p>Sweeped of it's feet,</p>
<p>By a hand-made buffor overflow,</p>
<p>Now listen to my homegroen thesis,
<p>As I move you with my vicious telekinesis.
