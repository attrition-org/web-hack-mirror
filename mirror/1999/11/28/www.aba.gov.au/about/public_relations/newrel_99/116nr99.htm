                and the other from Mid North Coast Indigenous
                Broadcasters Association Aboriginal Corporation
                (MNCIB). Radio Rhema seeks to represent the
                Christian community of Port Macquarie while MNCIB
                represents the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
                Islander population of the area.</font></p>

                licence was awarded to Radio Rhema as the ABA
                concluded that Radio Rhema had better established
                a need for its proposed service than MNCIB and
                that the proposed Radio Rhema service had
                demonstrated a greater capacity to provide a

                currently broadcasts a total of four hours per
                week of programming aimed at the indigenous
                community. In contrast, 2WAY broadcast only one
                hour per week of Christian programming. </font></p>

                applicants for the Taree licence, MNCIB and
                Manning Great Lakes Christian Broadcasters Inc.
                Every allocation is made on a case by case basis
                depending on the particular needs of the
