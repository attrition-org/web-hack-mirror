                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">The
                Australian Broadcasting Authority has registered
                revised Commercial Radio Codes of Practice which
                cover new Australian music, language, complaints
                handling and compliance with the codes. </font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">The
                main addition to the revised codes is a
                requirement that major music stations must
                broadcast a certain amount of &#145;new&#146;
                Australian music. The intention of this
                requirement is to provide much needed airplay for
                new and emerging Australian artists.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">Other
                provisions cover publicising and formally
                reviewing the codes, clarification of the rules
                regarding the use of coarse language and sexual
                material, and changes to how radio stations
                respond to written complaints about matters
                covered by the codes.</font></p>

                provision for new Australian music is a welcome
                addition to the codes and shows the commitment of
                broadcasters to the Australian music
                industry,&quot; said Gareth Grainger, ABA Deputy
                Chairman. &quot;The ABA is encouraged by the
                commercial radio industry&#146;s positive
                approach during this codes review.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">The
                revised codes came into effect immediately on
                their registration on 21 October 1999, replacing
                the corresponding original May 1993 codes. Their
                registration concludes extensive consultation
                between the ABA and the Federation of Australian
                Radio Broadcasters Limited (FARB). Public input
                was also an important aspect of the development
                of the revised codes.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">The
                ABA considered the revised codes against the
                requirements of section 123 of the Broadcasting
                Services Act 1992. Codes of practice are revised
                from time to time to ensure they reflect current
                community attitudes and relevant research. The
                ABA is satisfied that the revised codes provide
                appropriate community safeguards, are endorsed by
                a majority of licensees and that members of the
                public have been given an adequate opportunity to
                comment.</font></p>

                news/current affairs/talkback programs,
                advertising, and broadcasting the words of
                identifiable persons will not be concluded until
                after the completion of the ABA&#146;s current
                investigation into certain commercial
                arrangements entered into by talk-back radio
                presenters. Any changes to these codes that are
                made as a result of the findings of the
                ABA&#146;s investigation will be incorporated
                into revised codes which will then be submitted
                to the ABA for registration. Until this occurs
                the current codes covering these areas will
                remain in force.</font></p>

                high level consultation and negotiation between
                the ABA and FARB, the revised codes were included
                in the ABA&#146;s Register of Codes of Practice
                on 21 October 1999. The revised codes had been
                developed by FARB and submitted to the ABA for
                consideration in August 1999 after a six week
                public consultation period. They replace the
                corresponding codes that have been in place since
                May 1993.</font></p>

                officers and Members met with FARB a number of
                times to discuss the safeguards provided by the
                draft revised codes on various key issues. These
                have included FARB&#146;s response to the
                recommendations of the 1998 Senate Select
                Committee on Information Technologies regarding
                sexual content in radio programs, publicising the
                codes, formally reviewing the codes and

                Information Technology and the Arts and by the
                ABA, FARB submitted to the ABA a proposal for the
                introduction into the codes of a requirement for
                the broadcasting of &#145;new&#146; Australian

                developed under the provisions of
                section&nbsp;123 of the Broadcasting Services Act
                1992 (the Act). This sets down Parliament&#146;s
                intention that groups representing particular
                sections of the broadcasting industry will
                develop, in consultation with the ABA and taking
                account of any relevant research by the ABA,
                codes of practice that are to be applicable to
                those sections of the industry.</font></p>

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">The
                Act, at section 123(2) sets out a number of
                matters to which codes may relate. These include
                preventing the broadcasting of programs that, in
                accordance with community standards, are not
                suitable to be broadcast by that section of the
                industry. Another high priority is the need to
                ensure that children are protected from exposure
                to program material that may be harmful to them.
                Codes may also relate to the broadcasting of
                Australian music on commercial radio and also to
                methods of handling complaints from the public.</font></p>

                developing the codes the industry is required to
                take account of community attitudes to matters
                such as the portrayal of violence, sexual
                conduct, and the use in programs of offensive
                language. The industry is also required to take
                account of concerns about the way the use of
                drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, is
                portrayed.</font></p>

                    program formats since the original codes were
                    registered in 1993. This new category must
                    play at least 20% Australian music and

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">Clause
                4.3(d) of the revised code states that the
                requirement for the playing of &#145;new&#146;
                Australian music does not apply to a licensee
                whose format is such that new releases are not
                part of its weekly play lists. This clause was
                inserted to take into account those stations in
                category C whose format is classified as
                &#145;Gold&#146; (i.e. classic hits from the 50s
                to the 80s). Such a format would not, by
                definition, be able to incorporate the playing of
                &#145;new&#146; Australian music. FARB therefore
                believes that without the inclusion of this
                exemption &#145;Gold&#146; formatted stations
                would have to be moved to category D, where there
                is no requirement for the playing of
                &#145;new&#146; Australian music and where there
                is a requirement to play only 10% of Australian
                music overall.</font></p>
