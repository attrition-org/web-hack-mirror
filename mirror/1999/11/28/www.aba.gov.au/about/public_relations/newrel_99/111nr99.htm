                at the General Conference, Mr Grainger made an
                intervention proposing strategies for
                UNESCO&#146;s involvement in the communications
                and information sectors in the coming decade. In
                making the intervention, Mr Grainger drew on the
                conclusions of a number of forums concerning
                regulatory policy in the communications and
                information sectors. </font></p>

                Grainger proposed that UNESCO should consider
                moving to a more devolved and regionalised mode
                of operation in the communications and
                information sectors. </font></p>

                this way, UNESCO could play a real role and make
                a worthwhile contribution to ensuring that its
                work reflects the priorities of its member
                countries and facilitates the cross-cultural
                exchanges that need to occur in a global
                communications and information environment,&quot;
                Mr Grainger said.</font></p>

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">At
                the General Conference Mr Grainger was also
                invited to be one of five international experts
                participating in a world panel on social, ethical
                and legal issues of cyberspace. Mr&nbsp;Grainger
                identified four main areas that UNESCO should
                move forward on the Internet: access, education,
                information dissemination and content creation. </font></p>

                is important for UNESCO to find industry and
                community partners in this sector and work with
                them in promoting international consensus about
                Internet access and governance,&quot; said Mr

                the past year, Mr Grainger, as Chairman of the
                Communications Network of the Australian National
                Commission for UNESCO, has been invited to be a
                keynote speaker in a number of forums on issues
                concerning regulatory policy in the
                communications and information sectors. </font></p>

                making his intervention at the General
                Conference, Mr Grainger drew on the main
                conclusions of some of those forums and proposed
                strategies for UNESCO&#146;s involvement in the

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">Mr
                Grainger has proposed that UNESCO regional
                offices work closely with National Commissions to
                develop regional communications and information
                plans that would draw on a wide network of public
                and private sector operators. He envisages the
                UNESCO secretariat focusing its activities on the
                coordination and interconnectivity of those
                regional processes, and their distillation into a
                few big picture projects and initiatives that
                would provide an appropriate level of global
                vision.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">In
                March this year, Mr Grainger chaired the
                Asia-Pacific Internet Conference. The conference
                was convened by the ABA, with support from UNESCO
                and AusAID. Many of the 16 countries that
                attended this conference expressed concern about
                access and they saw international collaborative
                efforts as insignificant when technology is
                developing rapidly and information proliferates
                through new media. In such an environment, these
                countries considered it would still be some time
                before their communities would have access to
                basic communications systems, let alone new
                services such as the Internet.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">&quot;I
                believe UNESCO should be placing most emphasis on
                access to communications and information,&quot;
                said Mr Grainger. &quot;It should be asking how
                the opportunities of the so-called information
                age could be made available and relevant to the
                widest number of people in the world,
                particularly those in rural and remote
                areas.&quot; </font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">While
                he sees it as clearly within UNESCO&#146;s
                charter to address the protection of children
                from inappropriate content on communications
                services, Mr Grainger considers this work to be
                more appropriate for other forums in which the
                private sector is playing a prominent leadership
                role. These include the Global Business Dialogue
                and the Bertelsmann Foundation&#146;s process on
                Self-Regulation of Internet Content. </font></p>

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">&quot;UNESCO
                cannot expect to be a leader in this field&quot;,
                Mr Grainger said. &quot;However, it can play a
                useful role documenting the developments that
                occur as part of the process of achieving
                international consensus, and in disseminating
                this information in its member countries.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">Mr
                Grainger sees a role for UNESCO in supporting the
                growing global network of hotlines for dealing
                with inappropriate content on the Internet. In
                this role, UNESCO would work in association with
                other organisations such as the European
                Commission and INHOPE. Once again he considers it
                a matter best pursued as a regional initiative so
                that there is a greater sense of ownership and
                relevance to individual countries, as in the
                final analysis, it would be national parliaments
                that decide on policy and laws for their own
                countries.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">Mr
                Grainger concluded his intervention by appealing
                for strong support from UNESCO&#146;s Regular
                Budget and from the Participation Program budget
                for Australia&#146;s important initiative, the
                International Conference on Youth and Media
                Research, to be held in Sydney in November 2000.
                He also called for support for the conference for
                young people from the Asia-Pacific region that
                would be held soon after.</font></p>
