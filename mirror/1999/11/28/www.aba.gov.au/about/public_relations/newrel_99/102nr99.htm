                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">The
                Australian Broadcasting Authority has released
                the regulatory policy for the conduct of test
                transmissions of digital datacasting services.
                The datacasting trial will enable aspirant
                datacasters to test the technical feasibility of
                their services in four markets &#150; Brisbane,
                Canberra, Newcastle and Sydney.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">&quot;Ten
                submissions were received by the ABA when the
                draft policy was released in May 1999,&quot; said
                Professor David Flint, ABA Chairman.
                &quot;However, the policy will allow late
                expressions of interest from aspirants,
                particularly in areas where there may be
                unallocated spectrum in markets with
                under-utilised trial capacity.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">The
                ABA aims to keep trial datacasters informed about
                developments in Government concerning
                arrangements for the permanent datacasting
                scheme. However, the ABA emphasises that aspirant
                and trial datacasters should avoid forming any
                expectations about the future permanent
                datacasting regime on the basis of the trial
                policy. At this stage, the policy anticipates the
                commencement of permanent datacasting services as
                early as January 2001, and based on this, it is
                expected that all test transmissions would be
                completed by 30 November 2000.</font></p>

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">The
                policy allows for a full 7 MHz channel to be used
                in a market for the datacasting trial, but there
                remains the option for trial datacasters to use
                less than a full channel to conduct their test
                transmissions depending on their requirements.</font></p>

                markets where channels have been nominated for
                the datacasting trial, the ABA has decided to
                limit test transmissions to a maximum period of
                three months,&quot; said Professor Flint.
                &quot;In markets where there are more interested
                parties than there is available spectrum, shorter
                licence periods may be necessary,&quot; he added.</font></p>

                exercise control of commercial television
                broadcasting licences and their associates and
                national broadcasters and their associates, are
                eligible to conduct test transmissions using the
                channels identified in the policy. However,
                free-to-air broadcasters (commercial and
                national) wishing to conduct datacasting test
                transmissions using any spare capacity on their
                allotted spectrum may approach the ABA to
                negotiate appropriate arrangements.</font></p>

                Technology and the Arts wrote to the ABA in
                August 1998 requesting advice on practical
                arrangements for making broadcasting services
                bands spectrum available for test transmissions
                of datacasting services. In December 1998, the
                ABA replied proposing the features of a
                datacasting trial.</font></p>

                the ABA&#146;s intention that the trial be
                limited to minimise diversion of resources away

                needed for the conversion of television services
                from analog to digital and completion of analog
                planning for metropolitan and regional radio
                services. For example, it is currently envisaged
                that one broadcasting services bands channel will
                be made available in two capital cities and two
                regional centres for the purposes of the trial.</font></p>

                (ACA) indicates that there may be problems with
                using this channel at high power due to the
                potential for interference with
                radiocommunications services operating below 520
                MHz. Consequently, the ABA considers it premature
                to identify channel 27 for the trial at this
                stage. Another 6 MHz channel, VHF 9A, is
                potentially available for datacasting test
                transmissions in Brisbane and either Sydney or
                Newcastle, however technical specifications would
