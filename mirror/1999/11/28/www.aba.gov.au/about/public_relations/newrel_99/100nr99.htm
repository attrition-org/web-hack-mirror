                allow extensive coverage of the 2000 Olympic

                more scheduling flexibility than the current

                children&#146;s P programs during the week in
                designated time slots. The proposed variation
                will be a temporary measure for the duration of
                the games. The variation will allow weekday
                children&#146;s C and preschool children&#146;s P
                programs to be displaced for the Seven
                Network&#146;s coverage of the Olympic Games.

                holidays of the 2000 school year. In most States
                these will be the holidays between second and
                third terms, while in Tasmania the winter
                holidays are between the first and second terms.

                P and C programs,&quot; said Professor Flint.
                &quot;The consultant considered additional C
                programs in the school holidays would be welcomed
                by school age audiences during the colder months,
                while re-scheduling close to the Olympics event
                is a more appropriate solution for the pre-school

                importance. For the Sydney Olympics, however, it
                would be difficult to make up the amount of
                displaced C programming within the week either
                side of the Olympics as required under the
                current rules. In the case of P programs for
                preschoolers there is no allowance for
                displacement. However, a variation would allow
                the displacement of P programs to follow the
                current rules for C program displacement.</font></p>

                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">The
                ABA sought advice from a child development
                consultant on a range of options provided by the
                Seven Network for the rescheduling of the C and P
                programs. For C programming the consultant
                favoured re-scheduling the displaced period to
                the school holidays preceding the Olympic Games.
                An hour of programming each weekday afternoon
                from 4 pm to 5 pm during the winter holidays is
                likely to be acceptable to the child audience at
                a time when there are good reasons for seeking to
                be indoors. School age children are more likely
                to understand the significance of the Olympics
                and rescheduling of programs. In most States the
                C programs will be broadcast in the holidays
                between the second and third terms of the 2000
                school year, while in Tasmania the winter
                holidays are between the first and second terms.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
                face="geneva, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">For P
                programming, the consultant favoured doubling the
                programming in the weeks before and immediately
                after the Olympic Games using two time slots: one
                in the morning and one in the afternoon. Unlike
                school-age children, pre-schoolers would have
                difficulty connecting extra programming in, for
                example, July with the loss of their programs in
                September. The consultant considered it would be
                easier for them to understand the changes if they
                occur within a shorter time-frame. Scheduling
                episodes at separate times, one in the morning
                and one in the afternoon, will help maintain very
                young viewers&#146; enjoyment and engagement. The
                consultant also stressed the importance of the
                Seven Network alerting children, parents and
                carers of the changes to their usual viewing in
                an effective, prominent and frequent manner.</font></p>
