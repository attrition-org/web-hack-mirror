                &quot;The ABA has commenced negotiations with Mid
                North Coast Indigenous Broadcasters, seeking a
                binding commitment that it will enable the

                programming catering to the needs of the

                Broadcasters access to the Mid North Coast

                &quot;The applicant satisfied the ABA that it

                in Port Macquarie, NSW. There were two applicants
                for the Port Macquarie licence; MNCIB and Rhema.
                Every allocation decision is made on a case by
                case basis depending on the particular needs of

                arrangement. Such an arrangement might include
