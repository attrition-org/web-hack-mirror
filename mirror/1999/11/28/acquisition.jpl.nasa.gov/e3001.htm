VISION
<p>
People Taking Responsibility and Working Together to Provide a Customer-Focused Acquisition Process
<p>
OBJECTIVES
<p>
Significantly reduce acquisition cycle times for purchase orders and contracts, while reducing transaction costs and maintaining quality.
<p>
ALIGNMENT
<p>
This initiative is aligned with the Laboratory strategy and change goals to adopt best business practices and serve customer needs faster and more economically.
<p>
RESPONSIVENESS
<p>
The Laboratory has committed to carrying out missions faster and at a lower cost, and our internal customers are counting on our continued improvements in acquisition cycle times and reductions in the cost of acquisition support.
<p>
TACTICS
<p>
The Acquisition Division will continue to add commodities to the Just-In-Time system list; implement purchase card use, as appropriate; work with the Logistics and Material Services Section and the Accounting Section for further automation of the
end-to-end process; increase the number of Electronic Data Interchange purchases; and decrease the number of active suppliers.
<p>
METRICS
<p>
*  Compare actual average cycle times to targets.
<p>
*  Track transaction costs as a ratio of cost of acquisition operations divided by cost of goods and services procured.
<p>
*  Survey customers annually to assess their satisfaction with improvements.
