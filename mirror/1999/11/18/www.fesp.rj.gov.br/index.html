I'm going to make myself clear now. I've &quot;broken&quot; into your server, beacause I
needed a server fast and this is very vulnerable, so :). This had to be done and I don't
care if anyone trusts me but I think this can't be kept secret. It is about that the <b>PRESIDENT
OF CROATIA,<font color="#ff0000"> DOCTOR FRANJO TUDJMAN DIED</font></b>. Our admired
president died in the night of thrusday on the night 11th to 12th around 04-05 AM. The
authorities have been keeping this secret from the start. Allegedly, this is confidential
because of the Parlament and its disbandment. Since Franjo is dead he can't disband the
Parliament and this is treated like national security risk. How do I know it? Let's say
I've (stolen) read &quot;someone's&quot; mail, meaning people I don't want to name because
the thing is too big to go that far. I've got to watch &quot;my ass&quot; too :-P. Since
this all is one big shit and bigger things got covered up, I couldn't get over this just
like that. People, it's in your interest to at least ask yourself if the authorities are
telling the truth, because I can guarantee 100% (just that) and I have proof that the
people from the Goverment wrote about Tudjman's death in their personal mail. I think that
everyone has the right to know the truth no matter how threathening it is, because we had
ENOUGH of this anarchy!</font></p>
