<p align="center">She seems to like to cut small quotes from
letters and interviews, and then only print the small part she
wants you to hear and/or read giving the public a wrongfull
impression of what was actually said in that particular letter
and/or interview. If this woman sends you an e-mail asking about
anything at all, do not reply, or we will have carolyn meinel and
J.P. hack you.</p>
