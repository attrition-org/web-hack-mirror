i'm the modern-day enigma machine,
my crypto technique is like a smoke screen,
the feds think they got me in check,
with echelon and tempest,
but those suckers can't beat this,
cuz they know they'll get wrecked,
it will only take a sec!

encrypt and decrypt... our secrets shall never be cracked...!
encrypt and decrypt... try and try... their brains will be wracked...!
you're all out of luck!
cryptafuck!

they don't stop with their wiretappin' provisions,
chokin' our privacy with mass precision,
tossin' electromagnetic bursts,
we must prepare for the worst,
and with backdoors, they try to get inside,
but we've found other ways to hide,
use the tools which they provide,
and then we'll turn the tide!

encrypt and decrypt... our secrets shall never be cracked...!
encrypt and decrypt... try and try... their brains will be wracked...!
you're all out of luck!
cryptafuck!

our protection is seen as illegal munitions,
just like their fuckin' ammunition,
codes are my dietary nutrition,
hidin' text inside pics,
i must have my daily fix,
so i can bust out those ill tricks,
just live kevin mitnick!

encrypt and decrypt... our secrets shall never be cracked...!
encrypt and decrypt... try and try... their brains will be wracked...!
you're all out of luck!
cryptafuck!
