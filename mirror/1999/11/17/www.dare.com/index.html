Mickey Mouse Club! Mickey Mouse Club!

Who's the leader of the club
That's made for you and me?
M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E!

Hey, there! Hi, there! Ho, there!
You're as welcome as can be!
M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E!

Mickey Mouse! <b>Donald Duck!</b>
Mickey Mouse! <b>Donald Duck!</b>
Forever let us hold our banner high!
High! High! High!

Come along and sing a song
And join the jamboree!
M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E!

Interlude:
We'll have fun: we'll meet new faces!
We'll do things and we'll go places!
All around the world we're marching!

Who's the leader of the club
That's made for you and me?
M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E!

Now it's time to say goodbye
To all our family...
M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E!

We have fun and we play safely!
Look both ways when you cross crossings:
Don't take chances: Play with safety!
When you ride your bike be careful!

<b>Play a little</b>, work a little.
Sing a song while you are working!
It will make your burdens lighter.

Do a good turn for your neighbor.
You can learn things while you're playing.
It's a lot of fun to learn things.
