This is b0ld of the sp00ky kr3w 
j00 c4n b3 c0n2|d3r3d 4s 0wn3d. 

Well well well, another night, another Hacker at work,and another defacement.
One question that you might want to review many times over. 
Where's the security?

I see your a big fan of Bill Gates.
There is one thing that you may consider with using a ms o/s. There is no security.
The only security that you can have to be 100% safe is by unplugging your computer.

Once again the sp00ky kr3w has claimed another defacement.

Get some fuckin security.
