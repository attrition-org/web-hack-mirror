<h3>New State of Nevada Publications Index Available</h3>
<b>Compilation Covers 1993-1998</b>
</center><hr>


<p><b>CARSON CITY, NV--</b>Jokes abound on the amount of paperwork produced by the government.  But those having the last laugh are the ones who know how to use the gold mine of mainly free information assuming they could find it, among the maze of government agencies issuing data.  Now, thanks to a new publication available to the public, the task of finding information within the State of Nevada has become much easier.</p>



<p>        The State of Nevada <a href="nvpubform.htm">Publications Index</a> lists more than 1,400 publications produced by the State of Nevada from 1993 to 1998.  Titles range from such mainstays as the Nevada Constitution and the Statutes of Nevada to practical guides such as What You Should Know about the Plague; from historical resources such as the Inventory of Nevada's Historic Bridges to the unexpected treasure The ET Experience, a brochure published by the Commission on Tourism describing how to reach the military zone known as Area 51.</p>



        <p>The 397-page compilation was produced by the Nevada State Library and Archives with funding from Catamount Fund, Ltd., a private non-profit corporation developed by John H.O. LaGatta.</p>



<p>        "The idea of the index came to me after experiencing great difficulty in discovering the existence and whereabouts of Nevada government publications," said LaGatta.  "We are happy to have contributed toward making this wealth of information more easily accessible via the publication of the Index." The Catamount Fund is interested in public policy, Nevada, the arts, science and education, he said.</p>



<p>        The listings contained in the index were issued by more than 40 different areas of state government, including elected officials, legislative, executive and judicial branches, and independent commissions.  Most of the listings are available for free on the Web, or can be purchased for a small fee by contacting the issuing agency. Others may be borrowed from the Nevada State Library and Archives (NSLA).  In cases where only one copy remains, it is  noted as "archival" and can be reviewed on-site at NSLA.</p>



<p>        Besides its hundreds of listings, the index includes a table of contents, quick Nevada facts, a map of recreational sites in the state, a list of frequently consulted state publications, an agency publications list, and an index of subject areas covered by the publications.  It does not include items published by the University and Community College System of Nevada.</p>



<p>        "Knowledge is power," said Dale Erquiaga, director of the Nevada Dept. of Museums, Library and Arts.  "Part of our job is to distribute knowledge fairly and equitably, particularly so people can access government services."</p>



<p>        Two copies of the index are available for public use at the Nevada State Library, and home copies can be purchased for $12 (make checks payable directly to Catamount Fund, Ltd.)  
<a href="nvpubform.htm">Order forms</a> for the publication are available on the Web page at www.clan.lib.nv.us, as well as at the State Library and Archives by calling 800 922-2880 (in-state) or (775) 684-3360.</p>



 <p>       The State Library and Archives is part of the Nevada Department of Museums, Library and Arts, which also includes the Division of Museums and History, the Office of Historic Preservation and the State Arts Council.  DMLA serves Nevada's citizens and visitors through cultural and information management, preservation and promotion of cultural resources, and education.  Other key components of the department are the Comstock Historic District Commission, the Literacy Coalition, the Advisory Committee on Participatory Democracy, and the Commission for Cultural Affairs.  More information can be found on the Web at www.clan.lib.nv.us.</p>
