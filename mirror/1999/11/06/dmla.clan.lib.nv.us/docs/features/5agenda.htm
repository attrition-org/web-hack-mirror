<P><b>Program:</b></P>
<P><B><U>Plenary Session</u></b></P>

<blockquote>
<P>Overview of project inviting all to really participate in the many hands-on activities offered.  (There will be &quot;favorite&quot;  and &quot;need&quot; posters for attendees to write on posted sheets throughout area.  The &quot;status of libraries&quot; report will also be posted for attendees to update their community section.  The SHRAB &quot;blue sheets&quot; will be in all packets for filling out and leaving (duplicate set).  </P>

<P>The technology center will be set up with model forms for participants to fill out and go home with three documents.)  The schedule is set up so that Track I repeats, allowing participants to &quot;cross track&quot; over the two days.</P>

<P>Body of opening discussion will focus on &quot;Information Literacy v. Community Resource Centers&quot;……..how ancient information/oral history/scientific findings/historical documents/modern literature and arts all fit together…..we are all in this together.</P>
</blockquote>

<B><U><P>Track I - Technology</P></u></b>

<blockquote>
<P>Alan Mandel will set  up a technology center (12 computers).  We will preprogram a Strategic Library Plan, a Disaster Plan, and a Technology Plan onto the hard drives.  Attendees will be invited to an hour and  half hour session during which there will be an introduction  to each topic and time for them to begin to customize the model to their community.  Attendees may attend a Blitz session more than once.  Each participant will receive a disc of his/her work to take home.  Drafts will be archived with the Project.</P>

<P>Mr. Mandel is also involved with a TIAP proposal.  Blitz Sessions #2 will focus on working with groups which want to be included in this project.  (If space is available, attendees may continue to work on their Blitz One projects).</P>
</blockquote>

<P><B><U>Track II - Topical</u></b></P>

<blockquote>
<P>LSTA Funding - Most people who have attended the Five State Project Meetings have declared that they have no knowledge nor have not received LSTA packets.  This session will provide assistance to those wishing to fill out the application forms.</P>


<P>The second portion of the Day I Afternoon session will be an exercise in reviewing the State Master Library Plan and having participants provide input based on their community perspective.</P>

<P>Topical Session I of Day Two will focus on a discussion of &quot;Share v. Non-Share&quot;, the articulation of those things tribal communities wish to share with the general public and those they do not and the methods to determine and deal with such so that all those in the information community do not damage their relationships, maintain respect for one another and learn how to be diplomats in a mine field.</P>

<P>Topical Session II will be a &quot;hands on&quot; conservation workshop providing entry level information and skills for conservation of photo and electronic records.</P>

<P>There is a space available for the afternoon session of Day Two.</P>
</blockquote>

<P><B><U>Track #3 - Model Projects</u></b></P>

<blockquote>
<P>There are many exciting initiatives in Indian Country that could strengthen each other as well as be introduced to the library/archive/museum professionals of the state.  Each project will be invited to have a booth display at the Media Faire, but also to participate in panel discussions about their project (the 5W’s).</P>

<P>The afternoon of Day I will be a panel of the Star/Mesa/Washoe Education/Interpretive Project.</P>

<P>The morning session of Day II will feature &quot;Libraries of the Future&quot;/21<SUP>st</SUP> Century Learning Centers and the Language Projects.</P>

<P>The afternoon of Day II will focus on oral histories……..how to do them and the Grandma’s Letter Project of the Nevada Women’s History Project.</P>
</blockquote>

<B><U><P>Track #4 - Media Faire</u></b></P>

<blockquote>
<P>Publishers and authors as well as support agencies and model projects will</P>

<P>be invited to have a table at the media faire.  </P>

<P>Several  VCRs will be set up to play a selection of videos that the Committee feels should be in any collection. </P>

<P>Chairs for participants will be placed at each station to facilitate time to sit down and read/discuss/watch.</P>
