</B><P>On January 26-27, 2000, the Nevada State Library  & Archives will host a two day convocation focusing on the needs of tribal community libraries, archives and museums.  The content of the program has been developed in consultation with tribal representatives from Reno-Sparks, Pyramid Lake, Fallon, Elko, Ely, Walker River, Las Vegas, Washo Nation, Yerington, the Inter-Tribal Council of Nevada as well as the Nevada State Office of Indian Education and the Nevada Indian Environmental Coalition.</P>

<P>We hope you will consider being part of the convocation.  A draft agenda, outline of workshops, expected outcomes and preliminary registration form are enclosed.</P>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial Black">
</B></I></FONT><P>Expected attendance is 100 persons from throughout Nevada representing tribal entities as well as the public/school library, museum and archival institutions.</P>

<P>This is your chance to help develop public policy, funding mechanisms and program priorities for tribal information centers.  It is also an opportunity to receive direct technical assistance and develop the plans and proposal drafts to participate in various funding programs.  </P>

<P>If you are just interested in seeing all the wonderful materials developed by and for Nevada Indian Country, plan to spend two days at high intensity!</P>

<P>We look forward to working with you and thank you in advance for your support.</P>

others have little accurate information about us from our perspective and<br>
we have poor access to information from others which could benefit us.&quot;<br>
