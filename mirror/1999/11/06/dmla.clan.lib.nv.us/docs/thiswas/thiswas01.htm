This Was Nevada
<h2>Nevada's River of History</h2>
by Dale Erquiaga, Director
</center>
 
<p>This column, long penned by Nevada Historical Society curator Phil Earl, is part of what former President Ronald Reagan once called "the river of history."  The column has carried many Nevadans on its journalistic waters, demonstrating that the past remains a powerful force moving us ever forward and defining us as a people.  In the coming weeks, other noted scholars from the State Department of Museums, Library & Arts will join Phil Earl in giving you their view of history's course through Nevada.</p>

<p>        Why do we care about history?  We care because history not only tells us where we've been, it tells us where we're headed.  Even in a state like Nevada -- where we are more likely to implode a graceful old building on prime time television than we are to build a swanky new museum -- we recognize that the river of history can be a swiftly moving current hustling us toward the rapids of opportunity.  By careful study of our past, we prepare ourselves for the future. Nevada has long recognized this essential mission.</p>

According to a paper written for the 125th anniversary of Nevada's statehood by State Archives Manager Jeffrey M. Kintop, the tradition of preserving Nevada's history dates from at least 1861.  The Legislative Assembly of the Nevada Territory ensured that early records would be collected and given to the Secretary of the Territory, Orion Clemens, the brother of Samuel Clemens (better known as Mark Twain). In 1864, Orion Clemens - by then Secretary of State -- was declared both State Archivist and State Librarian.  He thus arguably assumed the role of Nevada's first official historian, preserving the records of state government and the publications issued by his fellow state officers. In addition, Nevada has long recognized the need for repositories of those three-dimensional items not found in the largely paper-based Library and Archives.  In 1869, the Legislature charged the State Mineralogist, once an elected constitutional officer, with maintaining a museum of mineralogical and geological specimens.  H.R. Whitehill (State Mineralogist, 1871-79) assumed the de facto role as the first curator/director of a Nevada museum.</p>



<p>The Nevada Historical Society, located in Reno, proudly dates itself to 1904.  Jeanne Elizabeth Wier was a principle figure from the Society's inception.  Again according to Kintop, "She was the life force of the society for more than forty years and personally collected many of the manuscripts, books and artifacts that are the basis of the society's collections."</p>



<p>In 1939, Weir's efforts were enhanced by Judge Clark Guild and others who helped create the Nevada State Museum at the federal mint in Carson City. As we prepare to enter the final year of the 20th Century, Nevada's Department of Museums, Library and Arts remains dedicated to the preservation of our state's documentary history and the artifacts that help tell Nevada's unique story.  We are proud to maintain the traditions of Orion Clemens, H.R. Whitehill, Jeanne Weir, Judge Guild and others. Our museums remain in touch with local communities.  The State Library and Archives delves daily into electronic records management, as well as the preservation of local historic documents.  History is alive and well in Nevada.</p>



<p>"This Was Nevada" will continue to bring this work to life as we travel the river of history with our readers.  Your comments, questions and suggestions are encouraged.  Please visit us on our Web site, www.clan.lib.nv.us or telephone the Department offices at 775-687-8393.</p>
