<p>HISTORY AND PROGRAMS<BR>
         The 
<a href="http://comnett.net/~kolson/">Lost City Museum</a> was built by the National Park Service to exhibit artifacts that
were being excavated from Pueblo Grande de Nevada.  These Anasazi Indian sites were being
threatened by the waters of Lake Mead as it backed up behind the newly built Hoover Dam. 
Eventually, when the lake was filled to capacity, about five miles of sites had been inundated or
undercut by the water.<BR><BR>
         The Civilian Conservation Corps assisted in the excavation of the sites and the
construction of the museum building.  The building was constructed of sun-dried adobe brick in
a pueblo- revival style.  The museum also served as the park headquarters for the Boulder Dam
State Park that was established at Lake Mead.<BR><BR>
         The museum is currently owned and maintained by the State of Nevada as one of its six
state museums.  Program include ongoing archaeological research on the remaining Lost City
sites, school tours and outreach programs, changing exhibits and archival library and collections
research capabilities.  Festival Americana, celebrating Native American and pioneer crafts, music
and food, is held the first Saturday in November.</P>
