The <a href="http://www.nsrm-friends.org/">Nevada State Railroad 
Museum</a> is dedicated to preserving the railroad heritage of
Nevada.  Opened in 1980, it features the locomotives and cars of the
famous <a href="http://pages.prodigy.com/jbryant/vtrr.htm">Virginia & 
Truckee Railroad</a> and other Nevada railroads.  Additional artifacts
from many other railroads in the region have also been acquired for preservation and
display.  The Museum has an ongoing research and restoration program with a high
standard of historical accuracy.</p>

<p>Among 65 locomotives and cars in the collection, the Museum has over 40 pieces of
equipment built before 1900, and 31 pieces that operated on the Virginia and Truckee
Railroad.  The Museum collection includes the Central Pacific <i>Director's Car</i> that
carried Leland Standford and the Golden Spike to Promontory, Utah, in May of 1869
for the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad.</p>

<p>The State of Nevada purchased many of these cars and locomotives from Hollywood
studios in the 1970s and 1980s, where they were made famous in movies and
television shows such as<i> Union Pacific, The Virginian, Wild, Wild West,</i> and <i>Little
House on the Prairie</i>.  The Museum continues to collect artifacts significant to railroad
history in Nevada.</p>

<p>The Nevada State Railroad Museum is located at 
<a href="rrcc-map.htm">2180 South Carson Street</a> (U.S.
Highway 395) at Fairview Drive, near the south end of Carson City, and conveniently
close to motels and restaurants.  The museum is open year-round, 7 days a week from 8:30 to 4:30.  Admission is $2; under 18, free.</p>

<p><i>Photo: The historic Inyo.  Built in 1875, it is the oldest operating 
steam engine in America.  It ran between Reno, Virginia City and Carson City.</i>
