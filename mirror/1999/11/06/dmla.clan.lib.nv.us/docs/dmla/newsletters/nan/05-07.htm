<h3><a name="1">THE</a> BUSINESS OF ART, NEVADA STYLE</h3>
</center>

<p>The Nevada Arts Council has commissioned Western States Arts Federation (WESTAF) to 
study the economic impact of the arts and culture industry in Nevada.  The purpose of the
study is to measure the economic dimension of the state's nonprofit arts industry and to
provide an up-to-date, quantitative illustration of the ways that the arts industry contributes
to the economic prosperity of Nevada.  Case studies will provide insights into the ways that
the arts operate in Nevada's diverse communities and the role the arts industry can play in
improving the quality of life for our growing population.</p>

<p>During the month of March, WESTAF Executive Director Anthony Radich and Erin Trapp, 
Director of Research, talked with artists and arts administrators, and members of the business
sector and press in community forums and focus groups held in Reno, Las Vegas and Elko. 
Intregrating input gathered during these meetings, WESTAF researchers developed two surveys,
one for nonprofit organizations and one for artists.  Employing a sample survey method, WESTAF
mailed approximately 700 surveys to artists, arts organizations, colleges, universities and arts
presenters that are part of the Arts Council database.</p>

<p>Data tabulated from the surveys will be used to develop an overview of the size, type and 
diversity of the economic contributions of the arts, and the cultural resources in the study area. Study objectives include:</p>

<ul>
<li>To quantify the current economic impact of the arts in the region</li>
<li>To identify localized economics-based arguments for support of the arts across the state</li>
<li>To collect qualitative arts-related economic information from community and arts leaders</li>
<li>To Identify and analyze the synergies between the cultural and business communities</li>
<li>To provide information regarding the perceptions that business and communtiy leaders have of
the arts community</li>
<li>To document the role that the arts play in the development and maintenance of the tourism and gaming industries</li>
</ul>

<p>Trapp and Radich will continue to interview arts community and business sector leaders and work with Reno economists Candace Evart with the intent of preparing a preliminary report before the end of this Legislature session on May 31st.  The final report will be forthcoming in early summer.</p>

<b>President Proposes NEA Increase</b></center>

<p>President Clinton's FY2000 budget proposal sent to congress on February 1, includes an increase for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) from its current appropriation of $98 million to $150 million. This is the highest budget level for the NEA ever proposed by the Clinton administration.</p>

<p>"We welcom President Clinton's strong and consistant support for the National Endowment for the Arts."  said NEA Chairman Bill Ivey.  "The new millennium provides the perfect opportunity for out nation to increase its commitment to strengthening our communities through the power of the arts."</p>

<p>NEA appropriations have been $98 million in FY98 and FY99, $99.5 million in FY96 and FY97 and 
$162.3 million in FY95.</p>
<hr width=200>

<center><b>NEA Announces New Initiative</b></center>

<p>Concurrently, the NEA announced its new initiative, <i>Challenge America</i>, which would provide $50 million in new funding directed at five issue areas: arts education, youth at risk, cultural/heritage preservation, community arts partnerships and access to the arts.  The <i>Challenge America</i> program will distribute funds for these purposes in four ways:</p>

<p>1. Approximately 1,000 communities will receive small to medium sized grants through an expedited review process to make the NEA more accessible to traditionally underrespresented areas of the country.</p>

<p>2. Approximately 120 communities nationwide will receive large grants for comprehensive community-based projects.</p>

<p>3. State arts agencies will receive 40 percent of the funding, in accordance with current Congressional policy, to support activities addressing the five target areas. </p>

<p>4. NEA will fund fifty national initiatives developed in partnership with other national organizations and federal agencies to address the priorities of <i>Challenge America.</i></p>

<p><i>Challenge America </i>would provide each state arts agency with an additonal $225,000 for a total budget allocation for states of $11.7 million.  States have identified 251 separate initiatives for which they would</p>

<p>Congressional consideration of the NEA budget begins this April in the house and Senate with hearings throughout the next three months before the Interior Appropriations Subcommittees.</p>

<center><h3><a name="4">Arts</a> Advocates Speak to Congress</h3></center>

<i>by Thomas L. Birch<br>
reprinted from NASAA Notes</i>

<p>On March 16, more then 300 arts advocates came to Washington, D.C. to talk to their representatives and senators about the importance of federal funding for the arts.  The advocacy visits were aimed at building congressional support for the National Endowment for the Arts.  The message delivered by arts advocates described the benefits of a potential increase in federal arts funding and its implications for reaching more communities and bringing the arts to more Americans.</p>

<p>Advocates explained to their legislators how the NEA awards more than 1,000 grants each year to nonprofit arts organizations for projects that bring the arts to millions.  Advocates also showed how grants to state arts agencies, representing 40 percent of the NEA's program funding, combine with  state legislative appropriations and other dollars to ensure broad access to the arts for communities throughout the state and serve to strengthen the state's arts infrastructure, through a combination of direct grants, technical assistance and services.</p>

<p>Last year, arts advocates scored important victories in Congress by rallying their legislators in the House and Senate to defeat efforts to completely eliminate funds for the NEA.  The size of the House vote, 253-173 in favor of continued federal arts funding, demonstrated bipartisan support for the arts on Capital Hill and added new strength to ensuring the NEA's political future.</p>

<p>Advocates in Washington this month made a point of reminding their legislators that the NEA has responded to public and congressional concerns about accountability with some important administrative changes:</p>

<p>1. grantees' reporting requirements have been tightened and final grant payment is contingent upon approval of an interim report;</p>

<p>2. state arts agencies received an increase in the block-grant formula to 40 percent of NEA funds;</p>

<p>3. grants have been eliminated to arts organizations for seasonal support or for subgranting in nearly every  catagory, and for direct funding to most individual artists; and </p>

<p>4. the size of the National Council on the Arts has been reduced from 26 to 20 with six positions held by members of Congress.</p>

<center><b>Nevada's Delegation</b></center>

<p><i>by C. DeVereaux, Executive Director of Allied Arts Council of Southern Nevada</i></p>

<p>"This land is your land, this land is our land," sang members of Congress on the steps of the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. on the sunny afternoon of March 16.  Singer Peter Yarrow strummed guitar and led a group of U.S. Senators and Congressional Representatives in an enthusiastic rendention of the traditional folk song as part of National Arts Advocacy Day sponsored by Americans for the Arts.</p>

<p>This was the third Arts Advocacy Day I've attended in Washington, D.C. on behalf of Allied Arts Council and the Nevada arts community.  This year I was joined by Joanne Nivison, manager of the Cultural Division, City of Las Vegas, who represented Nevada Arts Advocates,  Joanne and I paid a visit to  each of our U.S. Representatives, carrying letters from arts supporters in Nevada.</p>

<p>Senators Harry Reid and Richard Bryan, both longtime supporters of the arts and the NEA, confirmed their continued commitment to federal arts funding.</p>

<p>Newly elected Congresswoman Shelley Berkley was not present for our meeting, but we are confident  from her past record that she will be an active supporter of pro-NEA legislation.  Congressman Jim Gibbons expressed his doubt that a federal arts agency like the NEA could be as effective as a locally-run agency.  He also feels the federal budget cannot accomodate any increases directed towards the arts.</p>

<p>The focus of this year's Arts Advocacy Day was how to articulate the need for the budget increase to our elected representatives.  Joanne and I attended a number of workshops, lectures and presentations designed to help us with our advocacy efforts.</p>

<p>Arts Advocacy Day isn't all lectures, though.  There were plenty of opportunities to experience the very thing we were working to support.  In addition to a Congressional sing-along, Peter Yarrow entertained at a breakfast meeting, where we also listened to the Duke Ellington High School Choir.  Playwright Wendy Wasserstein gave her very witty view on the state of the arts at the annual Nancy Hanks Lecture on Arts and Policy, and Billy Taylor's Jazz Trio entertained at the evening reception.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that next year we'll have an even larger delegation from Nevada.  Contact me if you'd like more information on this year's event.</p>

<center><h3><a name="5">NEA</a> Program Director Visits Vegas and Reno</h3></center>

<p>Douglas Sonntag, director of the NEA Dance Program, visited with constituents in Las Vegas on March 9 and 10 and traveled to Reno for workshops on March 11 and 12.  In his second trip to Nevada in as many years, Sonntag provided an Endowment update and expressed optimism as Congressional support for the NEA increases and new programs are being planned.  In meetings both north and south, Sonntag talked about the new <i>Challenge America</i> initiative, and the opportunities it can provide for Nevada arts communities.  He outlined current NEA funding categories and briefly discussed the two-year old ArtsREACH program that was designed to increase the level of direct NEA grant assistance to communities in 20 underserved states, including Nevada.</p>

<p>In Las Vegas, Sonntag met with a general audience during a morning session at the Las Vegas Natural History Museum, and at the new KNPR-FM studio later in the day with representatives from eight local arts organizations as potential NEA grant applicants.</p>

<p>The Reno meetings followed the same agenda, with a presentation to a general audience and a series of one-on-one meetings with arts organizations interested in applying for a NEA grant.  The Theatre Coalition  hosted Sonntag's activities at the Moya Lear Theatre in downtown Reno.</p>

<p>Many thanks to the Las Vegas Natural History Museum, KNPR-FM and the Theatre Coalition for 
helping out with the NEA meetings.  And to those applying to the NEA, especially for the first time, please remember to contact NAC staff for questions or assistance in your grant preparation.</p>

<center><h3><a name="6">New</a> Web Site for Business Committee for the Arts</h3></center>

<p>To foster continued growth of business alliances with the arts, which have increased from $22 million in 1967 to a record $1.16 billion today, the Business Committee for the Arts, Inc. (BCA) has launched a  Web site <a href="http://www.bcainc.org">http://www.bcainc.org</a>.</p>

<p>The BCA Web site provides comprehensive information to help arts organizations develop successful alliances with business that meet the needs of both entities.  Two examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>A community theater company in Union City, Tennessee, worked with a local bank to help promote its productions.  The performances were sold out and the bank enhanced its image in the community, increasing its asssets by 54% one year and 32% the next.</li>

<li>In Snowmass, Colorado, arts organizations in the area worked with a hotel to turn a winter ski resort community into a year-round vacation destination.  As a result, the arts increased their attendance and the hotel's annual revenues increased by 23%.
</ul>

<p>The site also offers research findings and information about issues and trends relating to business-arts alliances.  For example:

<ul>
<li>65% of all business support to the arts in the United States is credited to small and midsize businessses.</li>
<li>92% of business support to the arts is allocated at the local level--a company's headquarters or major operating communities.</li>
</ul>

<p>The site includes examples of employee programs that foster greater appreciation for the arts, information about BCA member services, BCA Affiliates and international business-arts organizations, as well as privilaged information for BCA members only.  It also contains a BCA newsroom featuring current news about business-arts partnerships and a calendar of various business-sponsored arts events throughout the nation.</p>

<p>The BCA Web site was developed by IMBs/390 Division, Hopewell Junction, NY; designed and hosted by Waters Design Associates, Inc., New York, NY; and supported by research conducted by Porchey Research Inc., St. Louis, MO.</p>

<p>The Business Committee for the arts, founded by David Rockefeller in 1967, is a national nonprofit organization that works with business to develop and advance alliances with the arts.  BCA provides business with the services and resources needed to develop strategic alliances with the arts that meet business objectives, foster creativity in the arts and in the workplace and enhance the quality of life throughout the United States and abroad.</p>

<p>For more information, please contact Business Committee for the Arts, Inc.  1775 Broadway, Suite 510, New York NY 10019-1942.212/664-0600;Fax 212/956-5980.</p>

<center><h3><a name="8">The</a> ARTS Campaign</h3></center>

<p>"Get to know THE ARTS" is a slogan that will soon be blazing across the cultural landscape of Southern Nevada.  Allied Arts Council of Southern Nevada has recently unveiled a major community arts marketing campaign designed to promote visibility and accessibility of art and cultural events.  The project, the result of an NEA ArtsREACH grant with additional private matching funding, will foster cooperative marketing efforts in as campaign that includes special events, print and broadcast media, brochures, specialty products and other marketing strategies.  A highlight of the year-long campaign will be the introduction of two figures, "the arts family," a kind of performance-visual arts duo, who will be out on the arts campaign  trail to spotlight opportunities and engage audiences with a message that the arts are available to everyone
and that cultural opportunities abound in Southern Nevada.</p>

<b>A Musical Celebration of the New Millennium</b></center>

<p>The Carson City Symphony and Carson Chamber Singers have been selected to participate in
<i>Continental Harmony</i>, the american Composers Forum's Millennium Project.  This landmark community-based music commissioning and residency program is designed to connect rural and underserved communities with composers.  Fifty orginal works by American composers will be commissioned by participating local organizations and will be premiered as part of the program.  Composers will create the works, spend time in the host community with civic and educational groups and help musicians prepare the composition for the premier performance during the year 2000.  Many of these concerts will be performed on a single day, July 4, 2000.</p>

<p>Patricia Shifferd, project director, commented about Nevada's <i>Continental Harmony</i> community organizations, "The music the Carson City Symphony and Chamber Singers requested is a suite to include both esembles. The panel agreed that this project captures in a fine way the goals and spirit of<i> Continential Harmony</i>, and in  combination with the other states' projects, will result in a distintive mosaic of music to celebrate the new millennium.</p>

<p>To select the <i>Continental Harmony</i> sites, a national panel met in St. Paul in mid-December and reviewed more than 175 applications.  This January, composer applications were mailed to more than 5300 composers throughout the country.  Project staff will be assisting the <i>Continental Harmony</i> host organizations in the selection of composers during the spring months.</p>

<p>In addition to a shorter session, legislators are grappling with a record number of bills and an uncertain budget with which to work.  As you may recall, last winter, the Nevada Economic Forum, which by law determines the general fund spending level for the state, predicted a shortfall of revenues.  However, with  gaming revenues up during the past quarter, there is hope for a healthier budget for the upcoming biennium.</p>

<p>With minor adjustments, the Nevada Arts Council budget remains as outlined in Governor Kenny Guinn's Executive Budget that was presented to the legislature in January.  NAC's FY00 budget of $1,829.554 reflects a slight increase from this present year budget and includes costs dictated by inflation and funding to expand the distribution of <i>neon</i>, NAC's arts journal.</p>

<p>In March, Assemblywoman Sheila Leslie (D-Reno) introduced Assembly Bill 362 to appropriate an 
additional $105,000 to the Arts Council budget for its Arts in Education, Folk Arts and Grants Programs. Steven High, Nevada Museum of Art; Lisa Corcostegui, Zenbat Gara Basque Dancers; Daryl Crawford; Inter-Tribal Council of Nevada; Jill Berryman, Sierra Arts; Craig Pittman, Reno Police Department; and  Wendy Felling, arts educator and parent, made presentations in support of the bill at the Assembly Ways and Means Committee on March 18.  For more information on AB362, you can contact the Nevada Arts Advocates (formerly Nevada Alliance for the Arts) at (702) 362-8885.</p>

<p>Reflecting on his new positon, Erquiaga said, "I have an interest in everything the department does.  I genuinely believe in public service and want to hjelp change the state for the better.  I couldn't be more proud to serve Nevada in this capacity."</p>

<b>At the Nevada Arts Council</b><br>

<p>Governor Kenny Guinn recently appointed Dr. Keith Boman of Las Vegas to fill Eric Strain's tenure on the Nevada Arts Council.  As a leading cardiologist in Las Vegas for the past eighteen years, Dr. Boman has devoted his career to providing the most complete, compassionate and professional care possible to patients from all walks of life.  He is a graduate of Ed W. Clark High School in Las Vegas, received his B.S. from the University of California, Santa Barbara and graduated from the George Washington University School of Medicine.  While completing post-graduate training at UCLA, he  co-authored the original edition of "Cardiology for the House Officer," the first handbook and guide for residents and interns entering the field of cardiology.  He founded his solo practice in January, 1997, with the belief that medicine is an art as much as it is a science.  The art, he believes, lies in knowing and understanding his patients as well as his craft.  Dr. Boman's lifelong commitment to  caring for people extends well beyond his medical practice.  He devotes much of his time and energy to caring for the only community he has ever called home.  Deeply involved in numerous charities, professional and community organizations, Dr. Boman helped found The Meadows School, the Las Vegas Performing Arts Center Foundation, and was instrumental in the relocation of the Nevada Ballet theatre (formerly the Nevada Dance Theatre).</p>
