<h3>Our New Look And Feel</h3>
</center>

  

<p>After many weeks of hard work, we have redesigned the Department of Museums, Library and
Arts Homepage.  This page is all about how to get the most out of your visit to our site. </p>

<b> Let's Go!</b>
   <blockquote>
  If you're in a hurry, want to get right to the content, and skip the rest of this "How To"
     page, the <a href="siteindex.htm">Site Map</a> has links to all our major areas.
</blockquote>

<b>What about shortcuts?</b>
    <blockquote>
 You can select from our "Department of Museums, Library and Archives" menu bar
     (located at the top of  every page) anytime to jump immediately to the beginning of any of
     our major sections. They provide you with links that take you to 
<a href="../search.htm">Search</a> (Search this site
     and the WWW), <a href="siteindex.htm">Site Map</a> (a detailed site index), 
<a href="calendar/">Events Calendar</a>, 
<a href="press/">News Releases</a>,
<a href="new/">What's New</a> (updates to this site) and 
<a href="../email/wbmaster.htm">Email</a> (a form for questions).

</blockquote>



<b>How do I navigate this site?</b>
    <blockquote>
 The navigation buttons on the left will take you to another page within your current
     section.  At the bottom of every page there is a link to the DMLA Homepage as well as
     the State of Nevada Homepage.
</blockquote>

<b>How do I get more information?</b>
    <blockquote>
 We have provided an individual email link for each of our divisions so you can contact
     them directly.  Every  page has an email button in the menu bar at the top of the page. 
</blockquote>

<b>What is the image on the DMLA Homepage?</b>
<blockquote>
The image is an architectural drawing for the <a href="cc-mint.htm">Carson City Mint</a> (1870-1893), now home to the 
<a href="../museums/cc/carson.htm">Nevada State Museum</a>
