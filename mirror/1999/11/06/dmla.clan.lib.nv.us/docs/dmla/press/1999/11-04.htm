<h3>Nevada Indian Tribes Enter the Information Age</h3>
Statewide Collaborative Event in Reno on January 26-27</center><hr>


<p><b>CARSON CITY, NV--</b>American Indians in 26 tribal communities are coming into the information age through a program designed to enhance community libraries, archives and museums.   Tribal representatives from Reno-Sparks, Pyramid Lake, Fallon, Elko, Ely, Walker River, Las Vegas, Washoe Nation, Yerington are developing activities in consultation with statewide organizations including the Nevada State Library and Archives,  the Inter-Tribal Council of Nevada (ITCN), the Nevada State Office of Indian Education and the Nevada Indian Environmental Coalition.</p>

<p>On January 26-27, 2000, the Nevada State Library and Archives will host a two-day convocation at the Atlantis Hotel and Casino in Reno to articulate program priorities, identify funding mechanisms and develop plans for tribal information centers.   Tribal participants will receive direct technical assistance for developing plans and drafting applications to participate in various state and federal funding programs.</p>

<p>Objectives of this gathering are to:   Identify and articulate the needs for tribal information centers including libraries, museums, cultural, preschool and senior centers;   build awareness of public and private resources;  create partnerships and ongoing relationships with information resource providers; and facilitate collaboration.</p>

<p>"We expect the event will draw 100 persons from all corners of Nevada representing tribes as well as libraries, museums, archives and other professional information resource people, says Project Coordinator Shayne Del Cohen,  "At the convocation many exciting initiatives in Nevada Indian Country will be highlighted with the possibility of replication."   </p>

<p>Model projects will be on display at a Media Faire and featured in panel discussions.   The first day will feature a panel of the Star/Mesa/Washoe Education/Interpretive Project.  The second day will feature "Libraries of the Future" / 21st Century Learning Centers and Language Projects. </p>

<p> Technology will be emphasized throughout the event and participants will have opportunities for "hands on" activities in a 12-computer laboratory directed by Alan Mandel of the Nevada Indian Environmental Coalition.  Each participant will be assisted in customizing plans and models to reflect the needs of individual tribes and will take results home on a disc.   Assistance will be available for anyone wishing to complete application forms for a variety of federal grants available to tribes from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).</p>

<p>The Convocation and related activities are supported through an IMLS Library Leadership Grant project supported by the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA).  Through this project the Nevada State Library is working with state libraries in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah to develop models for collaboration among American Indian Tribes and Governments in this five-state region.  IMLS recently announced that the Five-State American Indian project will receive more than $317,000 to continue into a a second and third year.</p>

<p>Year two of the project will feature a regional convocation bringing together tribal representatives and information professionals from the five-state area.

Information about the project is also available on the website of the Nevada Department of Museums, Library & Arts at dmla.clan.lib.nv.us.</p>

	<p>"In Indian America, we have two major information problems," says Cherokee James May, "Others have little accurate information about us from our perspective and we have poor access to information from others which could benefit us."   The five-state project seeks solutions to both of these problems.</p>

	<p>The Nevada State Library & Archives is part of the Nevada Department of Museums, Library and Arts, which also includes the Division of Museums and History, the Office of Historic Preservation and the Nevada Arts Council.  DMLA serves Nevada's citizens and visitors through cultural and information management, preservation and promotion of cultural resources, and education.  Other key components of DMLA are the Comstock Historic District Commission, the Literacy Coalition, the Advisory Committee on Participatory Democracy, and the Commission for Cultural Affairs.  </p>
