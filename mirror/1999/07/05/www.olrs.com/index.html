    comfortable, <br>
    regular exercise at the gym, (3 days a week), <br>
    getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries, at ease, <br>
    eating well, (no more microwave dinners and saturated fats), <br>
    a patient better driver, <br>
    a safer car, (baby smiling in back seat), <br>
    sleeping well, (no bad dreams), <br>
    no paranoia, <br>
    careful to all animals, (never washing spiders down the plughole), <br>
    keep in contact with old friends, (enjoy a drink now and then), <br>
    will frequently check credit at (moral) bank (hole in wall), <br>
    favours for favours, <br>
    fond but not in love, <br>
    charity standing orders, (on Sundays), <br>
    ring road supermarket, <br>
    (no killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants), <br>
    car wash, (also on Sundays), <br>
    no longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, <br>
    nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate, <br>
    nothing so childish, at a better pace, <br>
    slower and more calculated, no chance of escape, now self-employed, concerned, (but
    powerless), <br>
    an empowered and informed member of society, (pragmatism not idealism), will not cry in
    public, less chance of illness, <br>
    tyres that grip in the wet, (shot of baby in back seat), <br>
    a good memory, <br>
    still cries at a good film, <br>
    still kisses with saliva, <br>
    no longer empty and frantic, <br>
    like a cat tied to a stick that's driven into frozen winter shit, <br>
    (the ability to laugh at weakness), calm, <br>
    fitter, <br>
    healthier and <br>
    more productive, <br>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font face="Courier New">The security of this site
(or lack thereof) has been compromised. <br>
We are not elite by any means.* <br>
We are merely of the disenchanted few no longer content to sit idly by and watch as the
internet and society as a whole gets thrown to the den of corruption and mindlessness. <br>
Must everything be dumbed down and watered so that we are no longer a thinking society? <br>
Religion has lost it's place to the internet as the opiate of the masses. (Although both
are still equally money-driven.) <br>
Television is a cathode-ray nipple for absent(minded)parents.&nbsp; <br>
The E-prefix is overwhelming us at every turn. <br>
(E-commerce, trading, auctions, church, porn, shopping, etc.) <br>
Our attention span has been reduced to 11 seconds per page.<br>
(Average page view time for internet &quot;surfers&quot;.) <br>
(Is anyone able to read a novel anymore?) <br>
What once was and could have been a valid and, dare we say, beautiful medium has turned
into something far more disturbing and unbeautiful. <br>
Treachery and pure laziness is what we are being systematically reduced to as we lovingly
clutch our mouse and tap away incessantly at our keyboards in some numb chat room. <br>
Orwellian to be certain. <br>
When will it stop? <br>

This hack is extended and dedicated to the purists who dare do go beyond what they are
&quot;allowed&quot;. This is for everyone who refuses to do what they are told and
invariably question the so-called authority that they are confronted with. Some absolute
mentionables are: ne0h, mozy, forpaxe, gH, p0g0, keebler elves, dr_fdisk^, level seven,
Devil-C, HiP, v00d00, HFD/B, xoloth1, and Attrition. (PS: Monisha is loved by
AntiChrist.We get the picture.)&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Notorious Young Slammers are Rev. Bob, Otto MadX, and High Plains Drifter.<br>
We are starting off small with introductions. There will be more. We demand an audience. </font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" color="#FFFFFF">*Elite, indeed. This was done easily enough
using Micro$oft Front Page. This site had no security whatsoever and anyone with the time
or inclination, technical ability aside, could do a hack such as this. Please note that no
damage was done and that the old index can be found HERE. Again, this is not the end.
