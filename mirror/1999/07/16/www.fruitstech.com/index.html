It amazes me that India and pakistan are waging a war over the Kargil problem. Indians and Pakis are brothers. We are from the same geographic location. The line that divides us was drawn by some shitty british clerk 50 yrs ago. Please please stop fighting and use your heads for once. If India and pakistan stand together the rest of the world gets fucked real bad..........
