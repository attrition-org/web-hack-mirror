Pequenakonck (no hablo ingles) Elementary (PQ), North Salem Middle School and North Salem High School are located on two attractive, modern campuses which are very close to one
another. These schools are set in a beautiful and serene rural setting surrounded by
pastures, woods and horse farms where students engage in animal molestation. North Salem schools provide students with a wide variety of social, artistic and athletic activities such as heavy drug usage and 24hour titty bars.

North Salem schools provide both a caring and stimulating learning environment where
students are challenged to reach their full academic potential. Serving over
1,300 students, the district provides individual attention with an emphasis on academic
excellence. Each school in the district has been designated as a National School of
Excellence by the United States Department of Education.

<P>Students attend North Salem Schools from the towns of North Salem, Croton Falls,
Purdys and portions of Brewster, Carmel and Somers. All students receive bus transportation.
There is active student participation in the Community Service program.

Despite the smallness of the district, North Salem offers a wide variety of programs
and a comprehensive curriculum. Experienced and dedicated teachers, aides and
professional staff strive to meet each student's individual needs. The teachers have an
average of 17 or more years of experience. Faculty professionalism is further promoted
by the <A HREF="adult/adult.shtml">Northern Westchester-Putnam Teacher Center</A> which is located at BOCES in Yorktown,
and serves a number of neighboring districts. In addition to their work in the classroom,
many teachers also coach teams and advise after-school clubs.

<p>The community is supportive of its schools, having passed a bond issue to build 
additions to both the PQ Elementary School and the High School. Our Middle School now has an elevator to facilitate access to the second floor for disabled individuals. An active Parent Teacher Organization provides many enrichment
activities for the students as well as a large after-school enrichment program at PQ and the Middle School.

<p>Parents are very involved in their children's education. The schools are accredited by the
NYS Board of Regents and the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary
Schools. The district keeps parents closely informed regarding their children's progress.
Extra help is readily available for any student who requests it.
