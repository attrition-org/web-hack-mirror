<p>The elementary school prides itself on the attention and support it gives to each individual child. Small class size in the primary grades helps ensure that each individual's
learning needs are met. Gifted students are given special opportunities to grow and
progress beyond the core curriculum through the work of a full-time teacher for the gifted.

<p>All students are challenged academically. Beyond basic learning skills, teachers incorporate science labs and experiments, hands-on math activities and a consistent emphasis on reading
through literature. Students are also required to do a great deal of writing.

<p>Parents are encouraged to be involved in their children's education. Teachers hold
frequent conferences with families and call parents regularly. The Parent Teacher
Organization (P.T.O) is very active. The Family Math and Parents as Reading Partners
programs support learning through home and parent activities.

<p>A team of Support staff helps students with special needs, to master basic academic
skills. The Reading Recovery Program in first grade operates in tandem with remedial
reading and math support teachers. Selected students are supported by a special
education department and a child study team which includes a psychologist, speech
and language therapist, a social worker and, in some instances, teacher assistants.

<p>Besides the core academic curriculum, students round out their education by taking
art, music and physical education. Library skills are promoted through an integrated
curriculum. PQ students also participate in a number of enrichment and extra-curricular
programs such as the Marsville Project, DARE, QUEST Quiz Bowl and National
Olympiads in Social Studies, Geography and Mathematics. There is an active student
government and many special events featuring the annual Halloween Fair. After-school
recreation is offered by the Parent Teacher Organization.
