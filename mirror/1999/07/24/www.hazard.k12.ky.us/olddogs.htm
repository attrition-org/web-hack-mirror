<p>If you attended Hazard High in the days before Happy Hollow,
we think you will enjoy seeing the building &quot;On the
Hill.&quot; This was not the first Hazard High School building
(the present central office building at 325 Broadway was the
first), but it is one in which many of the traditions of Hazard
High were formed. </p>
