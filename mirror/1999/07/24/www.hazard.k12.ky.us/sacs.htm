<P>The Hazard Independent School District is proud of its achievements
in serving the students of our community. All three schools in the district
were successful during the first biennium of the KIRIS Assessment. During
the first year of the second biennium of the KIRIS Assessment, the district
improved its standing from 17th. in the state to 15th. in the state in
absolute ranking by district total scores. The district is also proud of
the continuation of high quality supplemental and extracurricular activities
which provide the opportunity for a very large percentage of our students
to participate in various activities. </P>

<P>The district is involved in a district wide renovation project which
will upgrade all three schools. This project will address needs of the
KERA strands, construct pre-school facilities, replace roofs, upgrade heating-ventilation
and air conditioning systems, install energy-efficient windows, meet plumbing
renovation needs, and refinish interiors. An electrical upgrade involves
new lighting, service and distribution upgrades, and alarm and communications
equipment upgrades. These facility upgrades will serve the needs of the
school community well into the 21st. century. </P>

<P>Each school in the Hazard Independent School System has been a member
of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) since the early
years of the district. This regional accredation organization accredits
colleges and schools in eleven states from Texas to Virginia by requiring
high educational standards across state boundaries. </P>

<P>Hazard High School completed a five year interim review of their Southern
Association Self Study during 1995, with a visiting review committee in
the fall. Roy G. Eversole and Walkertown Schools will be entering a new
SACS Accredition Program, the School Renewal Process, beginning in the
1995-96 school year. </P>

<P>Each school in the district developed a transformation plan during the
1995-96 school year. In developing these plans, the staff of each school
analyzed a wide variety of data which affects student and school performance.
These sources included KIRIS data, parent, student and staff surveys, financial
reports, and other information. From this analysis came improvement plans
for each school, level and department. Each school planned improvements
in areas critical to student learning. Schools will carry out and monitor
activities implementing these plans during the coming year. </P>
