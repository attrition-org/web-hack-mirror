Use this form to search for telephone numbers and extensions for school
district employees. Fill in any box below to narrow your search to specific
individuals or specific schools and then click on the button labeled
"Get Phone Numbers". For example, if you put Smith in the last name field
you would get all Smiths in the district. If you put Smith in the last name
field and select a location, you would get all Smiths at that location.
If you leave the name fields blank and choose a location, you will get all
phone numbers for that location. If you leave all boxes blank, all district phone numbers
will be displayed. Names must be entered with the first letter capitalized and the rest of the name in lower case, i.e. "John" not "john" or "JOHN".
