The Center is responsible for Teen Ambassadors in the middle and high school. This group performs community service throughout the year and is the drug and alcohol prevention peer group. Another group associated with the Center in the high school is Peer Counselors. This group provides a positive role model to their peers concerning the various issues that face today's teens. They also tutor students that need help with their studies.<BR>

Believing a good start can mean the difference between success
and failure for some students, Paducah has offered Head Start
for three- and four-year-olds since 1965.  Eligibility is based
on federal income guidelines or disability. The federally-funded
child development program involves parents and the community in
the education, health and social services offered to the children. Head Start classess are being moved into the neighborhood elementary schools, beginning with three classes at Morgan in 1997-98; more classes will be moved to other schools later.

Helping H.A.N.D.S. is a joint effort by the Paducah City and McCracken County School systems to assist homeless children and their families. In order to break down the barriers that homeless children face in education, the program furnishes school supplies, clothing, transportation, and tutoring services. The program works closely with other community agencies to ensure that all homeless children and youth have the same right to a free and appropriate public education as non-homeless children and youth.
