Paducah Public Schools guarantee a free and appropriate public
education to students with special needs, ranging from the student
with functional mental deficiency to the gifted-talented child.

team evaluates students and designs individual instruction plans to
meet their needs in the least restrictive environment. Home/hospital staff teach students with long- or short-term illness at home or in the hospital.

learners&quot; in intellectual aptitude, academic aptitude, creative
thinking, leadership and visual/performing arts.

or accelerated programs in primary through the 12th grade.

schools, teaching students directly and collaborating with classroom
teachers. Elementary GTC students are eligible for 4+1 Saturdays, a winter
program.
