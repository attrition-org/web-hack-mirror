<P>
The district scored 50.3, compared to a state index of 48.3. District scores, compared to state averages, at the different grade levels are as follows:

<P>
All schools have another year to reach their goal. The current scores are like a mid-term report in the state's third biennium of KIRIS testing. They are from tests taken last spring, in the first year of a two-year testing cycle. Scores from next spring's tests will be averaged with this round to determine if schools earn rewards.
<P>
"This is a very high academic achievement for Paducah Tilghman, Clark and Morgan," said Superintendent Vance Ramage, "especially considering that all three reached rewards status during the last biennium."
<P>
If they can maintain their scores next spring, they should be eligible for rewards next year.
<P>
However, students at the other three schools will have to score significantly higher in the spring to bring up their two-year average to the reward status. "They will have to work hard to improve their scores," Ramage said, "but with extra high scores in the spring, they can still achieve their goals."
<P>
During the last biennium, five of the six schools and the district were in the "rewards" category. During the first biennium, only Clark earned "rewards."
