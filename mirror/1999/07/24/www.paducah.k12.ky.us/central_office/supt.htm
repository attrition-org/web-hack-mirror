<HR>
Paducah Public Schools are very proud of their long tradition
of serving students with strong and effective academic programs.
Our schools offer all the standard special education programming,
athletic programming and other expected ancillary programs typically
found in public schools. Moreover, Paducah schools are aware that
to serve the needs of current students and the developing requirements
of future students, we must be in touch with educational technology,
parent expectations and changing knowledge in the field of education.
<P>
We invite you to inquire about our schools, and to compare our
schools with others. Paducah schools have much to offer parents
interested in a rich academic program presented in a diverse,
small urban setting. Our schools prepare students to work and
live in a diverse economic, racial and social setting and, thus,
our programs are directly relevant to our students' future.
