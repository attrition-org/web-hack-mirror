<p align="center"><small><strong><font face="Verdana">Hmm, the media and just about
everyone else always deems a hacker as a bad, negative person just out to make a name for
themselves and look cool in front of their friends, is this true? No, not in most cases.
Pretty much all of us do it for a reason. Some of us do it for our country, some do it for
their woman, some do it because of personal problems and allot just do it to protest
against something or give their opinion on a certain matter. Another thing, people always
dis people for the bugs they use, well it is true some bugs are considered very easy and
called lame, but they are still bugs, a bug is a bug no matter how you look at it, just
some people go WAY out of hand with one exploit. Also, administrators and authorities say
that we cost them thousands of dollars in damage. How is that possible? We do them a
favor, we patch their security up and leave a sign that it was insecure. I suppose they
might lose business because their site is not its original self, but most of the time
people either put a link to the old html file or back it up. We do not cause damage, we do
not remove every file on the box or any for that matter, we delete logs, but that is
necessary of course. The only thing I am trying to prove is that we are not bad. No matter
what we use, we are trying to help you. We are trying to make the internet a secure place.
So don't put us down for things we are doing to help,&nbsp; please...</font></strong></small></p>

<p align="center"><small><strong><font face="Verdana">Besides doesn't most organizations
have something more serious and important to worry about than a few hackers putting their
'graffiti' on websites. I mean there are people being raped and murdered out there and
they get away with it. Don't you see some thing wrong with this picture?</font></strong></small></p>
