<pre>	I hope all you people have a happy Indepedance Day.
	Fireworks are going off, bottle rocket's, firecrackers,
	and of course M-80's (because they don't count as
	firecrackers).

		But enough of that, let's come back to the present,
		It's been a while since I did one of these things,
		and I thought I might as well pull one off, before
		I forget. About to head off to bed, and I thought I
		would leave you with something to read, in the wee
		hours of the night. Sleep well kiddos. Papa's got a 
		brand new bag.. (No he doesn't).

	People use FrontPage, and I have no problem with that,
	but why don't they consult someone before they throw a
	page onto the <i>'net</i>. There is really no security
	with FrontPage, and I'm showing this to you now. This,
	incase you haven't noticed, is not good security. This
	is junk. Clean up your site by using something other than
	FrontPage. If you don't have enough brain to make a html
	file, than use FrontPage to make the site, just not host
	it.

		Heh, when will those chumps ever learn. Here we are
		My friends, comrades, we have made it this far, and
		we haven't slowed down, no, we've picked up. We are
		defacing faster than we ever were, whether you think
		defacing is bad or good, it happens. Administrators
		do nott find out that they are hacked if you do not 
		deface, which can be good or bad. For me, in this
		situation, using FrontPage, and thinking that their
		security is fine, is bad, and considering that I can
		not do jack with a domain on FrontPage, I figure, I
		might as well deface. Sorry if you think I lack ethics
		or don't know about real hacking, but -- as always --
		Don't judge me for the colour of my skin, or the way
		I play the game, judge me for who I am.

	Have a good night... this is
	our world, and you don't stand
	a chance.
