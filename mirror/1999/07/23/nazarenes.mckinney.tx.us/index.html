Hello readers, we're back. This isn't coming from my fellow
groupies, this one is coming from me. Lately I've been told that
there is no reason to deface pages, and that it just shows how
lame you are. Well, here's another defacement. </p>

<p align="left">The lamest part about defacing is not the
defacement, it is not the size of the page, it's not the exploit
that was used. The lamest thing, that pisses me off, is how easy
it is to break into a web server. It's pathetic, I've actually
come to the conclusion that some admin's are actually wanting to
be hacked. Leaving PHF or ColdFusion open is stupid. I do not
know how people can actually think they are safe, if IIS is still
open. Jesus, you can at least run SATAN on your own network. It's
not even a worthy security auditing tool, but it catches some
shit that I am seeing left open on boxes around the internet. </p>

<p align="left">The thing is, it's not like one or two boxes, it
is virtually every domain you come across. I do not get '0-day
jaurez' from other hackers, I have not befriended anyone. I do
not get the latest news breaking shit, but I still find it easy
to break into a lot of stuff I come across. Yes, some stuff I
need help with, and when I do, I ask my friends for help.. but
the point I am getting at is how easy it is to './hack'. </p>

<p align="left">Administrators should know this stuff, they
should know how easy it is to break into their server. They
should know that any 12 can learn to run a file in Linux and
breach the security of their whole machine. I am not an admin,
but I know that if, indeed, administrators are trying to keep
hackers out of their system, they should be keeping up to par by
visiting sites daily. </p>

<p align="left">This is hackers asking something of you. Secure
your boxes, this is a joke. I get disgusted when I break into a
box running wu-ftp2.4.2[BETA-18](1) allowing anonymous writable
acess, that exploit has been out and was a big media
break-through. I ask admin's to secure the box, not because I
don't like hacking, but because I want a challenge. I've hacked a
lot of big companies, (sorry guys, no defacements yet, I still
need them). *Yawn* next please. My basic theory is that hacking
is only fun if it is a challenge. At this point of the
internet-world, hacking isn't fun. Once again I'm not out of the
scene. Just disappointed at how easy you make my 'job'. </p>
