I'd just like to take this moment to talk about all the people on IRC who scan you and try to telent to you ect. , Well..what the hell are you trying to do? Do you really think that if you go into a hacker channel and start scanning everyone in the room that noone is going to notice? It's this kind of ignorance that gets to me. I hope that all you little script kiddies out there will get a clue one day. Well that's the end of my rant...peace -T &amp; R
