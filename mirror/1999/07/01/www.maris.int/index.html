<center><b>about tS...</b><br><br>
just for the record, since no one seems to know when we were founded, tS has been around since early '98.<br>
we are not your average skript kiddie and neither do we have malicious means. we are not into 0wn1ng,<br>
we are just here to get the truth out. or well, what we think the truth is.<br>
many people out there say we should just put it on a website of our own instead of hacking someone else's<br>
site, but experience has proven that people rather listen when they are forced to, than when they are invited<br>
to. take eEye/microsoft for example. eEye did a great job on the IIS exploit, but microsoft didn't do anything<br>
about it, until eEye made it public with instructions on how to exploit the hole.<br>
also, one news agency stated hackers make the internet look like a bad place and they make it difficult to<br>
start eGov and eVote projects. it's not the hackers who put the holes into the software. it's the hackers who<br>
show it. it's called FULL DISCLOSURE. if we didn't do that, and you would go eVoting, malicious hackers<br>
would be able to break in and change the results, because after all, the holes WILL be discovered, you<br>
would just not know about it.<br><br><br>
<b>about f0bic...</b><br><br>
the story brought to you by attrition.org is true, f0bic got busted by the FBI and the DoD a while ago.<br>
we can't tell much about it, as we don't know too much about it. word is f0bic is free on bail and currently<br>
preparing his trail. because of all this, f0bic is no longer an official team spl0it member, and (this is for<br>
all you FBI people) SHOULD NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR FURTHER ACTIONS TAKEN BY TS.<br>
f0bic, we hope you'll get through this. we miss you.<br><br><br>
<b>about jay...</b><br><br>
jay, who has been a member of tS for quite a while now, decided it was time to lay off for a bit. due to problems<br>
at home, he will be quitting the scene for now. jay, i know you problems and i hope everything works out pretty well<br>
you were a fine member, you have good skills. peace for you, mangor.<br><br><br>
this was about all i had to say for now. peace, and remember, big brother is watching you.<br><br><br>
