<P ALIGN="CENTER">SILENCE - THE TEAM IS ABOUT TO SPEAK!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">anyone who has been following the hacking scene lately knows it - hackers are "owning" again.<BR>
dammit! nobody gives a fuck if you "own". don't hack to hack, don't hack to help the admins<BR>
(you are not helping them), god gave you a voice, USE IT! </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">we are the newskool hackers<BR>
we mainly live at night.<BR>
we fight with all our powers<BR>
for what we know is right.<BR>
and when some of us get caught<BR>
and cannot carry on,<BR>
through our friends<BR>
<B>the resistance lives on. </P>
</B><P ALIGN="CENTER">keebler elves and all you little pissants, you got the tekneeqz but you need to see the essence.<BR>
we are all fighting for the same thing, let's not try and compete. we should hook up together<BR>
someday. contact me.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">last but not least... every hacker knows there is one day we all fear. the day we wake up with<BR>
a gun pushed against our heads and FBI searching our rooms. remember though, even if we<BR>
get caught, even if we lose that battle, we know we went down on the right side. we will win the war.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">this site was hacked to bring out a message, not to make fun of gay people. you have my respect.</P>

THEY SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED FOR ACTIONS TAKEN BY OTHER TS MEMBERS.</P>
