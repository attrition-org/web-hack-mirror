<p align="center"><font face="Courier New"><big>A poem I wrote about Monisha</big></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Courier New" color="#408080"><big>Monisha, she is so cool</big><br>
<big>That she makes me feel like a fool</big><br>
<big>Monisha, she is so pretty</big><br>
<big>Sometimes I Feel I am so silly</big></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Courier New" color="#408080"><big>And now that its over</big><br>
<big>I Have this fear</big><br>
<big>That the memories will last forever</big></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Courier New" color="#408080"><big>I feel the pain</big><br>
<big>I feel the agony</big><br>
<big>Monisha why did you ditch me soooo...</big></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Courier New" color="#FFFFFF"><big>I have wondered why she
left me. She said i wasn't mature enough for a steady relationship. She mistook my devoted
love for some kind of childish crush. Well its funny but people always find it difficult
to understand me or is it the other way round????</big></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Courier New" color="#FFFFFF"><big>[Guys pardon me but once
in a while i am within my rights to dedicate a defacement fully to the girl I loved and
lost]</big></font></p>
