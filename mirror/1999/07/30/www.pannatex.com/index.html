<p align="center"><big><font face="Courier New">Yet another Indian site gets defaced.
Hmmm. This is getting funny. Its like a game. We are all players. keebre Elves is the top
team. People like m0zy and v00d00 are doin well too. Me and xess are the amatuers [sorry
xess]. Jericho and punkis are the scorers</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Courier New">I once saw this slogan somehwre
&quot;Rebel without a cause&quot;. Thats what we are doin now. defacing web sites without
any reason whatsoever. No point in sayin we did it to broadcast a msg. Kinda funny
broadcastin msgs by doing defacements i'd say.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Courier New">Well so where's my msg. well My msg is
that its fun this way. If the web was all secure and perfect it'd have been boring. Like
sunday school. But now its exciting and dangerous. and we all like to flirt with danger
right? that is till danger catches up with use &lt;G&gt;</font></big></p>
