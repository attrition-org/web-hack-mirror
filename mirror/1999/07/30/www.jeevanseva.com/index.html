<p align="center"><big><big><big>Defaced by The AntiChrist</big></big></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><big>I had a talk with v00d00 just now and he gave me a few pieces
of advice if I may use that expression. First he told me to stop giving shouts to people I
don't even know properly specially since half of them think i am a piece of shit. Next he
thought my colors were fucked up. So I am using his colors now. White on Black and centred
and courier new font. Hope you like this new html design. </big></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><big>As to why i deface only Indian sites these days well it's just
a matter of change. And its good to concentrate on a particular group of sites rather than
deface randomly. v00d00 says &quot;Defacing is lame and pointless unless you have a
serious message&quot; and I think he is right.</big></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><big>Now xoloth and dutchthreat might be thinking now that I was
makin fun of them by giving them greetz but this is not true. Despite you guys calling me
stuff you guys do maintain a pretty decent web site and that's why i gave shouts. But
v00d00 says you might have been insulted and so I am stopping the greetz with sadness in
my heart cause I always like to make friends. in real life i am such an introvert that in
the online computer world i love makin friends</big></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><big>&nbsp;</big></big></p>

<p><big><big>Now I hope everything is clarified and as to the surprised look on the indian
surfers who come here and see this stuff well welcome to the internet fellow countrymen.
Security is pretty much low and getting lower each day. Well I think I beter stop now.
next v00d00 will say my html was too big. &lt;G&gt;</big></big></p>
