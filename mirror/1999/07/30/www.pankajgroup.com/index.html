<p align="center"><big><font face="Courier New">Well guys one more Indian site defaced.
What's the point you might ask. Its a bit like smoking. Nobody knows why they get tempted
to keep smoking, i mean its not like alcohol in the sense you dont get intoxicated except
for a mild detached feeling. You kinda like to see the smoke leave your mouth.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Courier New">Defacements are like that. the more you
do, the more you want to do and finally you cant stop. So you keep defacing sites till you
get busted. i strted hacking sites for monisha but now she finds a lonely place in the
tile bar of my html jus for ol time's sake.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Courier New">So as to what happens when you get busted
well you can spend a long time thinkin abt all this stuff in a nice little jail(gaol)
cell.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Courier New">Am i scared? Not really. in india hacking
laws dont really exist else a few of use would have been in prison now. Well bye and
thanks again to good old v00d00 for givin me this new html style. Hope everybody likes it.</font></big></p>
