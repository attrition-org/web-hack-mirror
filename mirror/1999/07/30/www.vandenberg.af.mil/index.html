<!-- This is not just another stupid web page hack...We are tired, we have been silent long enough.
No longer can we just idely sit by and watch.  We want the world to know that we stand ready to help -
to unite and bring together the "hacker" collective.  Together we can achieve more.  You will hear from
us again!

Thanks Komi..>
