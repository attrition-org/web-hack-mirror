a Sober Man's Thoughts</font></h2>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Sorry to tread on your workspace. I did
it again boys and girls, another site hits the ground, another
one eating dust. Yes, I'm back, this time I have no apparent
reason really, sorry for breaking my own ethics. Do not look down
upon me, it's not happening often.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">I thought I'd do something before you
all forgot me. Not that you ever remember me, but you know. Yes,
I'm alive, well.. sort of. As alive as I can be, and I thought
I'd leave you people with something to think of before I hit the
sack (Yes, bed). Bah, I'm tired, been talking on the phone for
too long! I'm sick of the political shit going on over the
internet. That's the one thing I hate about being online. The
politics. I don't understand why people are getting caught up in
shit. It is just hilarious reading some of the stuff people are
getting into fights over.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Stuck for shit to write on. AntiChrist,
thank you for stopping your pointless defacments for Monisha...
They were getting old. Everyone's back from DefCon, and it was
awesome! Hope all you peope have a good sleep... and have seck-zi
dreems abowt your poppa Devil-C. <blink>*uNF*</blink> </font></p>
