Like Lenny Bruce, we are not afraid. <br>
And what is next? <br>
Who will step forward to point in some general direction? <br>
Insurrection is imminent. <br>
This is now. <br>
These are perilous times and the masses just sit contentedly watching situation comedies
as our freedom is slowly being taken away. <br>
Internet rules and regulations are here. <br>
The censorship is coming. <br>
Speak now or forever hold your peace.<br>
When will it stop?</font></p>
