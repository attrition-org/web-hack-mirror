<p><font face="Courier New">We are not hackers in any real sense of the word.* We are
restless and anxious and time is running out. We must do something monstrous before we
die. If we allowed or afforded ourselves a venue such as this and left things unsaid then
we would be no better than that which we would see ended in the first place. (Like seeing
the lone word &quot;FUCK&quot; spray painted on some wall. Is there nothing better to say
with such an opportunity in your hands?)</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">* Again, this site was entered and altered easily enough with
Micro$oft Front Page. For the elite out there, it is our hope that you understand that we
are attempting something noble and admit fully these recent defacements to be primer level
at best.&nbsp; We are not trying to steal anyone's thunder. We are not trying to be
something we are not. We sit with fingers crossed eternally that some form of organization
would develop and all groups and crews and individuals would band together to defeat a
greater evil. Together we are unstoppable. Together we are uncatchable. Together we will
demand an audience. Say the word. This is far from over. -N.Y.S</font></p>
