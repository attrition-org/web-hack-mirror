<p><font face="Courier New">1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a
disaster<br>
for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of<br>
those of us who live in &quot;advanced&quot; countries, but they have<br>
destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected<br>
human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological<br>
suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have<br>
inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued<br>
development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly<br>
subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage<br>
on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social<br>
disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased<br>
physical suffering even in &quot;advanced&quot; countries.<br>
<br>
2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break<br>
down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of<br>
physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a<br>
long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of<br>
permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to<br>
engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore,<br>
if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is<br>
no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from<br>
depriving people of dignity and autonomy.</font></p>

This time there was no password protection for the &lt;ROOT&gt; at all. This goes to show

you think you are safe? (Plushsafehethink.) Do you think you are secure? E-commerce and
all that it entails will fall like a pathetic Goliath under precise and accurate blows. Do
