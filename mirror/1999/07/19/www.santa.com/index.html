Hi kids, Santa here.. I decided to rebel against the world. You wont get your pokemon toys, 
or your gijoes, or your geini in a bottle either. So I suggest you stop wasting your damn time mailing me..<br><center>I don't give a shit.<br><p>
</center>I was just 'frolicking' through the email and stumbled upon a kid who wanted
a playstation and a n64 for christmas, and that he was a 'good kid.' Get a damn life.. go out and play..
It's summer, get high, drink beer, have sex, set things on fire for all anyone cares.<br><p>
<br><p>
My elves are the keebler elves.. not the pointed ear dick heads you see on TV and on christmas toilet paper.. but the hackers who make cookies. Yes, cookies.. crackers, the things you enjoy and love and can buy for half price or use a coupon.. or if your desperate, you can steal the cookies.. you don't have to be a good kid to have the cookies either.
