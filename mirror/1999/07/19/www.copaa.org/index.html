<CENTER>The Kashmir dispute primarily involves the life and future of the
people of the land. Because of its</CENTER>

<CENTER>impact on relations between India and Pakistan, however, it directly
affects the peace and stability of</CENTER>

<CENTER>the South-Asian subcontinent. This is a region which contains a
large segment of the human race.</CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>Two wars have been the harvest reaped from the dispute. The possibility
of a third, bloodier and</CENTER>

<CENTER>more extensive, has by no means been eliminated.</CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>The dispute is not insoluble through peaceful procedures. It appears
to be so only because the</CENTER>

<CENTER>obduracy of one of the parties is encouraged by the apathy of the
world outside.</CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>To cover its wrongful Occupation of Kashmir, India has skillfully
propagated a series of myths about</CENTER>

<CENTER>the genesis and nature of the dispute. Recently, a cordon has been
added to the smoke screen.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Having decided that it cannot bear exposure in the international
media, India has expelled all foreign</CENTER>

<CENTER>reporters and journalists from Kashmir.</CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>We believe that the United States can, and should, lead the effort
to</CENTER>

<CENTER>achieve a fair and lasting settlement of the dispute - fair to
the people most immediately involved and</CENTER>

<CENTER>fair to its commitments to democracy and human rights. By doing
so, our country can strengthen the</CENTER>

<CENTER>principles of a just world order. It will also earn the gratitude
of generations in Kashmir, in Pakistan</CENTER>

<CENTER>and even in India itself.</CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>We will try as best as we can to present facts and the perceptions
of the people of</CENTER>

<CENTER>Kashmir about the situation in which, for no fault of theirs, they
have been trapped. Should these</CENTER>

<CENTER>expositions encourage the readers to study the case independently,
we will be gratified.</CENTER>
