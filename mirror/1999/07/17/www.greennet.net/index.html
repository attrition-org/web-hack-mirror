World?</font></strong></p>

British Interception of Communications Act has<br>
been the target of proposed changes recently. The<br>
changes would require all communications service<br>
providers to build in, at their expense, capabilities for<br>
government agents to be able to listen in to<br>
communications. This proposal is particularly broad as it<br>
does not stop at the internet and covers everything<br>
from pagers to video conferencing to VPNs. Theses new<br>
requirements have been proposed by the International<br>
Law Enforcement Telecommunications Seminar<br>
(ILETS)an exclusive FBI funded group that meets in<br>
secret. </font></p>

see something wrong with that?</font></p>
