The case is not closed on Kevin Mitnick,<br>
who was sentenced Friday to 46 months<br>
in prison after pleading guilty to seven<br>
counts of wire and computer fraud. The<br>
notorious cracker still faces California<br>
charges for computer fraud. <br>
<br>
US District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer<br>
accepted Mitnick's guilty plea to five of<br>
25 federal counts of fraud plus two<br>
counts of fraud in Northern California. <br>
<br>
No date has been set for a trial on<br>
Southern California charges, which stem<br>
from a 1993 arrest in which Mitnick was<br>
accused of fraudulently obtaining<br>
information from the Department of Motor<br>
Vehicles. If convicted of those charges,<br>
he could face an additional four years<br>
behind bars. <br>
<br>
Friday's plea agreement set total<br>
damages of up to US$10 million.<br>
Prosecutors and defense lawyers could<br>
not reach agreement on restitution,<br>
which will be determined at Mitnick's<br>
sentencing hearing, scheduled for 14<br>
June. Final motions and a pre-sentence<br>
investigation report are due by 1 June. <br>
<br>
Mitnick has already spent 48 months in a<br>
Los Angeles detention center, including<br>
14 months for violating conditions of his<br>
supervised release. He could be released<br>
to a halfway house this fall. <br>
<br>
But US Attorney David Schindler said<br>
Mitnick would be in prison &quot;at least<br>
through next year.&quot; <br>
<br>
Don Randolph, Mitnick's attorney, said his<br>
client was relieved to have his federal<br>
case resolved. In a prepared statement,<br>
Randolph said, &quot;[Mitnick] can now see<br>
light at the end of the tunnel, and has a<br>
reasonable certainty that it is not<br>
another train approaching.&quot; </font></p>
