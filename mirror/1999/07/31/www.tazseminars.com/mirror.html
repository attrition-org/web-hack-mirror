<p align="center"><font face="Courier New"><strong>WHY?</strong><br>
~~~~</font><br>
<br>
<small><font face="Courier New">Why do allot of people deface? Because they want attention
in most cases.... That's kind of stupid. I mean if you are going to deface something at
least put something worth while or something that people want to look at on. Keebler Elves
and HFD always hit big sites and make it humorous and sometimes very serious at the same
time, that's what people like to look at, things that will make them laugh or people
fighting for a reason. What is your purpose? to prove security wrong eh? Oh yeah, you
could easily just leave the admin a note explaining how you got in and where to get a
patch for the hole rather than making him/her look like a complete fool. You could be the
one coding and finding out new security holes and develop new things. I mean, take the
Keebler Elves for instance, they have stated that they code their own exploits, and I
believe it, because they had shown mad skillz time and time again. Team Spl0it is another
group people should be like. EVERY TIME they deface a site they give it a good reason.
They ALWAYS have a purpose. This is all why I decided to do something. I am no longer
going to deface. I did this to show my appreciation to all of the groups and individuals I
mentioned and all the other hackers out there trying to make a difference. If you think
that I should not quit defacing. Please do say so.</font></small></p>
