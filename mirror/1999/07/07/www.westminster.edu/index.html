<h2>Ya know.. I just noticed on the accual page this college is related to the 
Presbyterian Church.. so if I offended you... well.. that's life.. get used to 
it. <br>So so.. a college site that just wasn't set up right.. thats life 
too.... who the hell set this up anyway? Constant blabbering.. what the hell 
else is there to put on a hack page? <br>I'd like to think that getting a 
college page is sort-of an accomplishment.. probably not.. <br>OHHH! I almost 
forgot.. look out for <a href="http://www.bo2k.com/">Back Orifice 2000</a>, 
making its first appearance at Defcon (July 10, 1999) in vegas! 
<p>oh.. and exovus is a spamming pimp.. and uhm.. hey tle.. hows it goin?
<p>sh0utZ 2: my crew, my possy, my.. whatever.. claimed another for playland.. 
lala.<br>oh.. and Jerry Farwell can go suck a big fat cock.
<p>I guess that's about all.. until next time, bye bye!
