<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma">Man, we noticed there is some negative comments and
thoughts about us. What did we ever do? We never dis anyone or harm anything. We have
respect for all individuals/groups. So anything we did, we're sorry. Our main directive is
not to deface pages, We have other things in the working, and also half of the things we
get we do not deface, we warn the admin. Glad that is cleared up. <a href="mailto:flem@888.nu">E-mail Us with your thoughts and comments</a></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma"><strong>Kevin Mitnick</strong> finally they stop
fucking with him, after 5 damn years he finally gets sentanced. Did he deserve 5 fucking
years? with no trial, not being able to use a computer. And depriving him of many thing,
taking away time of his life? No, he did not deserve that, and he does not deserve anymore
time...</font></p>
