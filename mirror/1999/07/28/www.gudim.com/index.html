</pre>
</center></div>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Holmes,&quot; said I as I stood one morning in
our bow-window looking down the street, &quot;here is a madman coming along. It seems
rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood
with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a
bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the
ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been
ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up
edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The gray pavement had been
cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer
passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was
coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and
imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in
a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and
well-cut pearl-gray trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of
his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a
weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked
his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary
contortions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;What on earth can be the matter with
him?&quot; I asked. &quot;He is looking up at the numbers of the houses.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I believe that he is coming here,&quot; said
Holmes, rubbing his hands.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Here?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me
professionally. I think that I recognize the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?&quot; As he
spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the
whole house resounded with the clanging.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">A few moments later he was in our room, still
puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes
that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get
his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to
the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head
against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the
centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting
beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew
so well how to employ.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;You have come to me to tell your story, have
you not?&quot; said he. &quot;You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have
recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which
you may submit to me.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving
chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set
his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;No doubt you think me mad?&quot; said he.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I see that you have had some great
trouble,&quot; responded Holmes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough
to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced,
although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also
is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have
been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the
land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Pray compose yourself, sir,&quot; said Holmes,
&quot;and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen
you.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;My name,&quot; answered our visitor, &quot;is
probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &amp;
Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to
the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.
What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this
most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself
to tell his story.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I feel that time is of value,&quot; said he;
&quot;that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure
your cooperation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on
foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I
am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts
before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;It is, of course, well known to you that in a
successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative
investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our
depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans,
where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the
last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon
the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at
the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the
name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even to you I had better say no
more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth--one of the
highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honor and
attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air
of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed
that you are in the habit of advancing money.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'The firm does so when the security is good.'
I answered.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he,
'that I should have 50,000 pounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum
ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to
carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is
unwise to place one's self under obligations.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'For how long, may I ask, do you want this
sum?' I asked.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and
I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it
right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'I should be happy to advance it without
further parley from my own private purse,' said I, 'were it not that the strain would be
rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the
firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every
businesslike precaution should be taken.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'I should much prefer to have it so,' said he,
raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. 'You have
doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'One of the most precious public possessions
of the empire,' said I.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Precisely.' He opened the case, and there,
imbedded in soft, flesh-colored velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he
had named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' said he, 'and the price of the gold
chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double
the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I took the precious case into my hands and
looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'You doubt its value?' he asked.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Not at all. I only doubt --'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set
your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely
certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is
the security sufficient?'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Ample.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving
you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have
heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon
the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because
I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it.
Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls
in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with
you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I
said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000 pound
notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in
front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession,
a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted
having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter
now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;When evening came I felt that it would be an
imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers' safes had been
forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position
in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would
always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out
of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham,
carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and
locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes,
for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of
the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with
me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another,
Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came
with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very
pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is
the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good
girl in every way.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;So much for the servants. My family itself is
so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only
son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes-- a grievous disappointment. I
have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very
likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not
bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a
wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it
for the best.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;It was naturally my intention that he should
succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and,
to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he
was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners,
he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He
learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and
again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he
might settle his debts of honor. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous
company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George
Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a
man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently
brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the
fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips,
one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great
personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his
presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his
eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my
little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into character.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;And now there is only she to be described. She
is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I
adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my
house--sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and
quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do
without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has
asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I
think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and
that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too
late--forever too late!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live
under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room
that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious
treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr,
who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the
door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous
coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'In my own bureau.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be
burgled during the night.' said he.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'It is locked up,' I answered.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I
was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;He often had a wild way of talking, so that I
thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very
grave face.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast
down, 'can you let me have 200 pounds?'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have
been far too generous with you in money matters.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'You have been very kind,' said he, 'but I
must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'And a very good thing, too!' I cried.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a
dishonored man,' said he. 'I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some
way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I was very angry, for this was the third
demand during the month. 'You shall not have a farthing from me,' I cried, on which he
bowed and left the room without another word.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made
sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house
to see that all was secure--a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it
well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the
side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought,
a little disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Certainly not.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'She came in just now by the back door. I have
no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is
hardly safe and should be stopped.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'You must speak to her in the morning, or I
will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Quite sure, dad.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Then. good-night.' I kissed her and went up
to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I am endeavoring to tell you everything, Mr.
Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon
any point which I do not make clear.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;On the contrary, your statement is singularly
lucid.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I come to a part of my story now in which I
should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my
mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then,
I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had
left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay
listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of
footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear,
and peeped round the comer of my dressing-room door.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief!
How dare you touch that coronet?'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my
unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light,
holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with
all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I
snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it,
was missing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself
with rage. 'You have destroyed it! You have dishonored me forever! Where are the jewels
which you have stolen?'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Stolen!' he cried.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the
shoulder.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'There are none missing. There cannot be any
missing,' said he.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'There are three missing. And you know where
they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off
another piece?'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I
will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you
have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in
the world.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'You shall leave it in the hands of the
police!' I cried half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to the
bottom.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he
with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to call
the police, let the police find what they can.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;By this time the whole house was astir, for I
had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the
sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the whole story and, with a scream,
fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the
investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the
house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my
intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter,
but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was
determined that the law should have its way in everything.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me
arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house
for five minutes.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'That you may get away, or perhaps that you
may conceal what you have stolen,' said I. And then, realizing the dreadful position in
which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honor but that of one who
was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would
convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with
the three missing stones.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'You may as well face the matter,' said I;
'you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If
you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all
shall be forgiven and forgotten.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for
it,' he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for
any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the
inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but
of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the
gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for
all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after
going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use
your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at
present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have
already offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honor, my
gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked
himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes,
with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Do you receive much company?&quot; he asked.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;None save my partner with his family and an
occasional friend of Arthur's. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one
else, I think.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Do you go out much in society?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We
neither of us care for it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;That is unusual in a young girl.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not
so very young. She is four-and-twenty.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;This matter, from what you say, seems to have
been a shock to her also.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Terrible! She is even more affected than
I.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;You have neither of you any doubt as to your
son's guilt?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;How can we have when I saw him with my own
eyes with the coronet in his hands.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was
the remainder of the coronet at all injured?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Yes, it was twisted.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Do you not think, then, that he might have
been trying to straighten it?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;God bless you! You are doing what you can for
him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose
were innocent, why did he not say so?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he
not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular
points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your
sleep?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;They considered that it might be caused by
Arthur's closing his bedroom door.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;A likely story! As if a man bent on felony
would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the
disappearance of these gems?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;They are still sounding the planking and
probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Have they thought of looking outside the
house?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The
whole garden has already been minutely examined.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Now, my dear sir,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;is
it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you
or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to
me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose
that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened
your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went
off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill
thatcan find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he
exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a
theory tenable?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;But what other is there?&quot; cried the
banker with a gesture of despair. &quot;If his motives were innocent, why does he not
explain them?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;It is our task to find that out,&quot; replied
Holmes; &quot;so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together,
and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in
their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were
deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the
banker's son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I
had such faith in Holmes's judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope
as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the
whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat
drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh
heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke
into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a
shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white
stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad
lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the
right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat
hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen's entrance.
On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at
all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door
and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen's path, and so
round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went
into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there
in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle
height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor
of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face.
Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept
silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had
done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of
strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she
went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;You have given orders that Arthur should be
liberated, have you not, dad?&quot; she asked.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to
the bottom.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know
what woman's instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for
having acted so harshly.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Why is he silent, then, if he is
innocent?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry
that you should suspect him.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;How could I help suspecting him, when I
actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at
it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no
more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I shall never let it drop until the gems are
found--never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to
me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire
more deeply into it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;This gentleman?&quot; she asked, facing round
to me.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;No, his friend. He wished us to leave him
alone. He is round in the stable lane now.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;The stable lane?&quot; She raised her dark
eyebrows. &quot;What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir,
that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is
innocent of this crime.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with
you, that we may prove it,&quot; returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow
from his shoes. &quot;I believe I have the honor of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I
ask you a question or two?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this
horrible affair up.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;You heard nothing yourself last night?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak
loudly. I heard that, and I came down.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;You shut up the windows and doors the night
before. Did you fasten all the windows?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Yes.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Were they all fastened this morning?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Yes.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think
that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the
drawing-room. and who may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I see. You infer that she may have gone out to
tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;But what is the good of all these vague
theories,&quot; cried the banker impatiently, &quot;when I have told you that I saw Arthur
with the coronet in his hands?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back
to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I
presume?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Yes; when I went to see if the door was
fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Do you know him?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our
vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;He stood,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;to the left
of the door--that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the
door?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Yes, he did.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;And he is a man with a wooden leg?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's
expressive black eyes. &quot;Why, you are like a magician,&quot; said she. &quot;How do
you know that?&quot; She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes's thin, eager
face.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I should be very glad now to go
upstairs,&quot; said he. &quot;I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house
again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">He walked swiftly round from one to the other,
pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he
opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens.
&quot;Now we shall go upstairs,&quot; said he at last.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished
little chamber, with a gray carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the
bureau first and looked hard at the lock.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Which key was used to open it?&quot; he asked.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;That which my son himself indicated--that of
the cupboard of the lumber-room.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Have you it here?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;That is it on the dressing-table.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;It is a noiseless lock,&quot; said he.
&quot;It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the
coronet. We must have a look at it.&quot; He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he
laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller's art, and the
thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a
cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Now, Mr. Holder,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;here
is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg
that you will break it off.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">The banker recoiled in horror. &quot;I should not
dream of trying,&quot; said he.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Then I will.&quot; Holmes suddenly bent his
strength upon it, but without result. &quot;I feel it give a little,&quot; said he;
&quot;but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time
to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did
break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all
this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I do not know what to think. It is all dark to
me.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What
do you think, Miss Holder?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I confess that I still share my uncle's
perplexity.&quot; &quot;Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;He had nothing on save only his trousers and
shirt.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Thank you. We have certainly been favored with
extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not
succeed in clearing the matter up. With your pemmission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue
my investigations outside.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">He went alone, at his own request, for he explained
that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he
was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as
inscrutable as ever.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I think that I have seen now all that there is
to see, Mr. Holder,&quot; said he; &quot;I can serve you best by returning to my
rooms.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are
they?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I cannot tell.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">The banker wrung his hands. &quot;I shall never see
them again!&quot; he cried. &quot;And my son? You give me hopes?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;My opinion is in no way altered.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Then, for God's sake, what was this dark
business which was acted in my house last night?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;If you can call upon me at my Baker Street
rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it
clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I
get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I would give my fortune to have them
back.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Very good. I shall look into the matter
between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here
again before evening.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was
now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even
dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavored to sound him upon
the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in
despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried
to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his
collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a
perfect sample of the class.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I think that this should do,&quot; said he,
glancing into the glass above the fireplace. &quot;I only wish that you could come with
me, Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be
following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back
in a few hours.&quot; He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched
it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started
off upon his expedition.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">I had just finished my tea when he returned,
evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked
it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I only looked in as I passed,&quot; said he.
&quot;I am going right on.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Where to?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may
be some time before I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be late.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;How are you getting on?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been
out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet
little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit
gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly
respectable self.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">I could see by his manner that he had stronger
reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there
was even a touch of color upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes
later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his
congenial hunt.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of
his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days
and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no
surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the
morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh
and trim as possible.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;You will excuse my beginning without you,
Watson,&quot; said he, &quot;but you remember that our client has rather an early
appointment this morning.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Why, it is after nine now,&quot; I answered.
&quot;I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was
shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad
and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a
shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than
his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I
pushed forward for him.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I do not know what I have done to be so
severely tried,&quot; said he. &quot;Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man,
without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonored age. One sorrow
comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Deserted you?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept
in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last
night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well
with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers
in this note:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought
trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never
have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your
roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is
provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an
ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving MARY.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes?
Do you think it points to suicide?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the
best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your
troubles.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr.
Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an
excessive sum for them?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I would pay ten.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will
cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is
a pen. Better make it out for 4000 pounds.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">With a dazed face the banker made out the required
check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with
three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;You have it!&quot; he gasped. &quot;I am
saved! I am saved!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief
had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;There is one other thing you owe, Mr.
Holder,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Owe!&quot; He caught up a pen. &quot;Name the
sum, and I will pay it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very
humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I
should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Then it was not Arthur who took them?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day,
that it was not.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him
at once to let him know that the truth is known.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;He knows it already. When I had cleared it all
up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it
to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which
were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his
lips.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this
extraordinary mystery !&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I will do so, and I will show you the steps by
which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say
and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your
niece Mary. They have now fled together.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;My Mary? Impossible!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;It is unfortunately more than possible; it is
certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted
him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England--a ruined
gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece
knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred
before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows
best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him
nearly every evening.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I cannot, and I will not, believe it!&quot;
cried the banker with an ashen face.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I will tell you, then, what occurred in your
house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room. slipped
down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His
footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of
the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I
have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover
extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly
listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the
window rapidly and told you about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged
lover, which was all perfectly true.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his
interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.
In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking
out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she
disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment. the lad slipped on some
clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair.
Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son
saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and
he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence
he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand
out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her
room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;As long as she was on the scene he could not
take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant
that she was gone he realized how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how
all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet,
opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a
dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught
him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet,
and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over
the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in
his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed
that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavoring to straighten it
when you appeared upon the scene.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Is it possible?&quot; gasped the banker.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;You then roused his anger by calling him names
at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain
the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough
consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her
secret.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;And that was why she shrieked and fainted when
she saw the coronet,&quot; cried Mr. Holder. &quot;Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have
been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to
see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged
him!'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;When I arrived at the house,&quot; continued
Holmes, &quot;I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces
in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and
also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the
tradesmen's path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it,
however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,
whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell
that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown
by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had
gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom
you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden
without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I
got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of
me.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;There was a double line of tracks of a booted
man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet.
I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first
had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places
over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I
followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow
away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down
the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had
been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I
was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood
showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I
found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clew.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;On entering the house, however, I examined, as
you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once
see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the
wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion
as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the
gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with
him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which
neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment
in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man
and who was it brought him the coronet?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;It is an old maxim of mine that when you have
excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I
knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and
the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in
their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was
an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a
disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had
fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;And who could it be who was her confederate? A
lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to
you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited
one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of
evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the
missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter
himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own
family.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Well, your own good sense will suggest what
measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house, managed to
pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night
before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of
his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly
fitted the tracks.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane
yesterday evening,&quot; said Mr. Holder.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my
man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play
then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so
astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At
first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had
occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man,
however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a
little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held
1000 pounds apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why,
dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the three!' I soon managed to
get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no
prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000 pounds
apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to
my bed about two o'clock, after what I may call a really hard day's work.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;A day which has saved England from a great
public scandal,&quot; said the banker, rising. &quot;Sir, I cannot find words to thank
you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed
exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologize to
him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to
my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&quot;I think that we may safely say,&quot; returned
Holmes, &quot;that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too,
that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient
punishment.&quot; </font></p>
