         <font color=red><b>Letter From A Jew Kid <font size=3 color=red>And His Small Penis.</b></font><font size=4><br><br>
 <font size=4 color=black>
        I am a Jew. When I was born in Teheran, Iran on April 13th, 1953, my
 parents named me Saeid, a traditional Persian name. Because my parents
 were assimilated into a secular culture, and chose not to send me to a
 Jewish school, I knew nothing about Judaism when I was young.  As a
 result, I was sadly uneducated about my religious roots.
       <br><br> In order for you to learn something important about the life of a man,
 I would like to share with you a few of my experiences.  I left a
 sheltered life in Iran for the United States when I was sixteen.  For
 the first time, I had contact with the “real world” - an adult world
 where people take note of who you are and judge you on the basis of what
 you are.  Though I could be the nicest guy, I met people who concluded
 that I was bad, simply because I was a Jew.
       <br><br> It was at that point that I decided to learn a little about my
 religion. Being Jewish means that you are distinctly different in many
 ways.  For centuries, the physical characteristic that separated Jewish
 men from all other Gentiles was their circumcised penises.  This was a
 truly unique aspect of Jewish manhood, that is until circumcision became
 an accepted medical procedure during  the 20th Century.  
       <br><br> Because I knew so little about my own heritage, I didn’t understand a
 lot about the male organ.  <font color=red>All my life I had heard rumors that Jewish
 men had small penises.<font color=black> I preferred to think that a man’s identity in the
 world was about more than the size of his dick.  It’s shocking that
 anyone should judge you by the size of your penis.
      <br><br>  I have lived a lot, and I’ve seen the world and there are certain
 things I know are the truth.  I’d like to share these ideas with you so
 that if you should meet me, you won’t have to wonder about my religion
 or the size of my circumcised dick.
    <br><br>    To repeat - I am a Jew, my name is Saeid and my penis is six and a half
 inches long.  I am in great shape and I’ve had sex twice a day almost
 every day during the past thirty years.  Because I respect my body and
 take care of it, I am in better shape now than when I was seventeen
 years-old.  I have never had any sexual problems and I have had many
 female admirers.  How many of you men can say that about yourselves. I
 have never had any problems making love to a woman, unless I <font color=red>(entered
 myself into a black hole.)<font color=black>?   Based on my sexual experiences with too
 many women to count, I have learned that the size of a man’s penis won’t
 matter in satisfying a woman, in fact, you dont even need a penis to satisfy a woman if you dont believe me check out <a href=http://www.doctorsex.com>doctorsex</a> or <a href=http://www.mrssex.com>mrssex</a>.<br>
  1. <font color=red>Get as much sex education as possible</font>
 <br> 2. 99% of relationships are based on sex
  <br>3. Knowing how to arouse a woman during foreplay
  <br>4. Good breath control - which means no cigarette smoking
 <br> 5. A connection to reality - which means no drugs
 <br> 6. Clear thinking  - which means no alcohol
 <br> 7. Plenty of rest
  <br>8. Having endurance and energy which comes from daily exercise
 <br> 9. Having the sensitivity to satisfy your partner’s sexual needs  
 <br>10. Knowing how the Zen concepts of Yin (positive energy) and Yang
 (negative energy) relate to sex.  You need to be in 
 a positive mode and make sure your sexual mate is in the 
 Yin mode, as well, otherwise your sex life will become a 
 nightmare and you won’t be able to perform at your maximum
 level.
 <br>11. That you don’t cheat on your partner
<br> 12. That you avoid slutty women - never date sluts
 <br> 13. Marry your own kind      
      <br> 14. Dont commit gay acts unless you are gay  
  <br> 15. No sex during a womans menstrual cycle
<br> 16. A strong, healthy body
<br> 17. A strong back
<br> 18. Study your religion to the fullest
<br> 19. Do not ever marry your relatives it is a bad mix of blood
<br> 20. Do not have sex with animals

 <br><br> My sexual education, which began with a foolish rumor about Jewish men
 and small cocks, led me to a career in the sex business.  My experience
 in this field, as a businessman and a counselor, has made me a pro.  Now
 I want to share something of lasting value with you and your partner
 about sex.  
        <br><br>It’s so important to find someone with whom you’re compatible.  If your
 foot is size nine, then you’d better buy shoes that are size nine or
 you’ll regret it with every step you take. If your partner is not
 compatible with you, which also means that the size of her vagina must
 be compatible with your penis size, then you will never reach the
 maximum pleasure you’re capable of.  
   <br><br>     You should look to marry a girl who’s a virgin, a girl you love and
 with whom you’re very gentle.  Don’t overdo your intercourse with her -
 several times a week is enough.  If you take your time, in a few months
 her pussy will be molded to your penis and that’s the way it will stay
 for the rest of your lives. You will never have to worry about sex. 
It’s like planting a tree - if the
 hole into which you put the tree is too large, if the tree is
 over-water, and that tree is so loose it moves around, then the tree
 will fall and die. 
     <br><br>   Your other choice is not a pleasant one.  You will regret it if you
 marry a slutty girl who’s had so many penises in her that she’ll never
 have a custom fit with you.  This is the formula for a disaster.  
     <br><br>   But I must tell you, as a man who’s had experiences with women all
 over this planet, you will never give any woman 100% satisfaction
 because that’s the nature of women, if you think you can, you are a fool,
 and you’re not going to change
 that.  That’s why you have to learn and accept - there are many things
 more important in a man’s life than his dick.  A horse has a dick, too,
 and it’s bigger than yours will ever be.  So what?             
     <br><br>   Learn to be proud of your heritage and of your race.  After studying
 and traveling around the world, I can truly say that I am honored and proud to be
 born as an Iranian Jew it is a unique experience.  I am proud of who I am, and I can assure
 you, I am proud of my six and a half inch dick.
    <br><br>    I thank you for your time and for reading my message.  I hope you have
 a great life.<br><br>
                                        Sincerely yours,
                                        Saeid Yomtobian
