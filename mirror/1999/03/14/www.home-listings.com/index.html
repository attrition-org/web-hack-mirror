<title>When Love Is Lost, All Is Lost.....</title>
<b>See The Light</b>
<p>
as i sit down in my seat
<br>
i feel a cold gust of wind
<br>
reaching for my jacket to conserve some heat
<br>
virtuall isolated from others
<br>
usually hated this place
<br>
and i stare you right in the face
<br>
but my case is to weak
<br>
and i try to seek
<br>
seek a plea
<br>
knowing i cant's see
<br>
see the light from my cell


<p>
I saw the light
<br>
from an old broken window
<br>
glass shattered everywhere
<br>
i saw the light
<br>
coming from the blue sky
<br>
and i know that very few gets to see it
<br>
i saw the light
<p>


then i look at the floor
<br>
it's such a sore to my eyes
<br>
it makes me wanna cry
<br>
because i am cut off from the outside world
<br>
i wish i could sit and watch the tide do out
<br>
but i cant
<br>
cant see the light from my cell

<p>


please lord
<br>
let me see the light
<br>
i'll never do it again
<br>
lord i promise
<br>
what is wrong with me
<br>
please just let me see
<br>
just give me the key
<br>
i know i have decived you
<br>
just tell me who
<br>
teel me what to persue
<br>
because i'm blind
<br>
i cant see
<br>
see the light from my cell




<p>
i follow my dreams
<br>
but thats not good enough
<br>
cut me please
<br>
kill my disease
<br>
the disease of life
<br>
because i cant see the light from my cell

<p>
