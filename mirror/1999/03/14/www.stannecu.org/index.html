<title>When Love Is Lost, All Is Lost.....</title>

<b>Sin</b>

<p>
you look up to the sky
<br>
you noticed all the stars
<br>
each one is different
<br>
in there own little way
<br>
then you look at the blood on your hands
<br>
then you look at the corps
<br>
in the sand
<br>
just rotting away


<p>

you have sined 
<br>
your going to hell
<br>
you have sined

<br>
and you think "oh well"
<br>
you have sined
<br>
and you wash your face off in the sink
<br>
you have sined
<br>
here i go.....

<p>
you neel down at the foot of your bed 
<br>
you pray silently
<br>
you pray for your life
<br>
you say "please spare me"
<br>
just dont scare me
<br>
because i fear for my life
<br>
please steer me clear
<br>
clear of trouble
<br>
clear of death
<br>
clear of sin......


<p>

then you lie down in your bed
<br>
and you fall asleep
<br>
you fall right into a dream
<br>
you dream that you die
<br>
and your paralized
<br>
and you try
<br>
try to cry
<br>
but you cant
<br>
because you have sined......
