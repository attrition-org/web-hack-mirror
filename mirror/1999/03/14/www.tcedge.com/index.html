<b>FEAR</b>
<p>
Fear your life away
<br>
dont stand up for what's right
<br>
it will come back to haunt you
<br>
its your que
<br>
que to die
<br>
no more hi'z
<br>
or goodbye's
<br>
to my suprize
<br>
you dont even care
<br>
you just stair
<br>
off into space
<br>
you see another ugly face
<br>
you treat it as an uncareing soul
<br>
like yourself
<br>
like an empty shelf
<br>
dusy and old
<br>
its getting cold
<br>
let your life unfold
<br>
put me on hold
<br>
see my fear
<br>
my deadly fear





<P>

i hear you down the hall
<br>
i dont even call
<br>
and even if you fall
<br>
i wont help you
<br>
because you never help me
<br>
you dont even see me
<br>
you pass me by
<br>
and i sigh
<br>
you will see my fear
<br>
you will feel me fear
<br>
and in return
<br>
you will have fear
<br>
im not here
<br>
im over there
<br>
you dont care
<br>
so i stair with rage
<br>
lock me in a cage
<br>
run from me
<br>
dont come to me
<br>
or i will show you fear
<br>
and you will never again
<br>
see the light of day



<p>

they say your the queen
<br>
your the worst iv'e ever seen
<br>
you have a cold heart
<br>
please dont start
<br>
or i will reliece my fear
<br>
upon you
<br>
you will feel my rage
<br>
rip out a page
<br>
burn it
<br>
turn it to dust
<br>
theres no lust
<br>
so why sould i care
<br>
im aware
<br>
of your carelessness
<br>
so i give you the same in return
<br>
let it burn
<br>
deep inside
<br>
dont hide
<br>
because i will find you
<br>
no matter where you go
<br>
where you run
<br>
ill be one step ahead
<br>
ill remember what you have said
<br>
now
<br>
feel my fear
<P>
