<TD>Alloha, this site was hacked, but not with bad meanings ! It was just to proove that the security on this site was
very.... well, was there security ? So admin, I helped you out, I improoved your security a bit.
Now take this advise: learn about how to improove security on your
server ! there are lot of good security-related sites wher you can read about the weak points in systems.
( for example : <A HREF="http://www.403-security.org">http://www.403-security.org)</A> who give info for free !
Or just use a searchengine for other sites....If you want to know more about this hack mail me
at <A HREF="mailto:meestervervalser@hotmail.com">meestervervalser@hotmail.com </A>
Good luck with that. Now some greetz to : All members of Dutch Phreakers Front (Holland will hear of them soon...), Acos and the other people of dutchthreat.org (I hope you come back online soon) 
and to Mr.A from Croatie (you know who you are). Now I have to say sorry for the bad layout,
but it was made in notepad, sorry, sorry, sorry. (just replace index2.shtml to index.shtml to restore the original page)	Good luck, De Meestervervalser&nbsp;
