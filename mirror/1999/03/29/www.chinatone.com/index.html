Dear Admin, YOUR SITE WAS COMPRIMISED!
<br><br>
Chinese security *sigh*, after all that has gone on in China, your networks are
still insecure.  Why?
<br><br>

<br>
Now, about more important things.
<br>
<h3>gH is back in the scene</h3>
<br>
You forget about us? Did you think we were gone for good?
Well, we're back, sorry to spoil yer happyness
<br>
We're a little tired of all you kiddies dissing us while we were inactive for quite sometime.  Just because we haven't changed any html source in awhile, dosen't qualify us as lame.  If we had wanted to, we could have changed many pages, on misc. boxes, but we choose not to because we have better projects to work on.
The competition is over, we will always be better.
