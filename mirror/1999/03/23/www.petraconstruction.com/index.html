<b>In a Dream</b>
<p>


in a dream
<br>
i saw my parents
<br>
i was in my house
<br>
looking at the christmas tree
<br>
mother lit candels so we could see
<br>
see the dream more clearer



<p>

dreaming can become dangerous
<br>
and I dont know why
<br>
it attacks you 
<br>
when your off guard
<br>
it will eat you
<br>
for the rest of your life
<br>
you can never forget
<br>
you can never put it behind you
<br>
you will live with it 
<br>
for the rest of your life



<p>



i looked at the christmas tree
<br>
saw the train going round and round
<br>
just like my dream 
<br>
confusing and unclear
<br>
saw the presents
<br>
what little we had
<br>
it makes me sad
<br>
but mother always said
<br>
be happy with what you get




<p>

i walk in to a church
<br>
dazzed and confised
<br>
passing a golden plate around
<br>
my friends by my side
<br>
we got half was through
<br>
and something happens
<br>
and i dont know wat it was
<br>
you life can change in a slpit second 
<br>
and you'll never know why
