This is simply the beginning of what will be a streak of strikes, just
to demonstrate that what many of these 'hackers' do, doesn't make them
as 'el33t' as they think.
They want to *front* by decieving web pages, so here it is.

Just because you can get 0day juarez and own some lame, poor-security
servers doesn't mean you are a hacker. Actually, in lamers term, it makes
you a skr1pt k1d. Yes, we owned this server, Yes, we did use exploits, BUT
we dont go around fronting about being hackers. You do it for fame. We
do it to make YOU guys look bad.<br>
This is all the panic we will cause here... for now.<BR>
RESPECT fools!<BR>
