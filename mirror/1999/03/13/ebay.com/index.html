This page was hacked initially on 99.03.13. It was later hacked again 
on 99.03.17 for a few minutes to demonstrate that control of the network was 
still maintained. You can view both hacks here:

99.03.13 <a href="mirror.html">First Mirror: Up for one hour.</a>

99.03.17 <a href="second.html">Second Mirror: Up for a few minutes.</a>

Articles: (All have since been moved and now result in 404s on the remote site)
