<title>When Love Is Lost, All Is Lost.....</title>
<b>Shadowy Grave</b>
<p>
I look at your tombstone
<br>
reading the engravings
<br>
I notice all your beautiful flowers
<br>
so many of them
<br>
so many people admired you
<br>
I requested this spot
<br>
the spot under the tree
<br>
you always liked to lie in the shade
<br>
so I give you a shadowy grave


<p>
I love you 
<br>
and don't ever forget that
<br>
i wanted us to grow up together
<br>
but you had to put me out
<br>
out of your life
<br>
when you did except me
<br>
except me into your heart
<br>
i didn't know where to start
<br>
i practiced  what i would say 
<br>
over and over again
<br>
but now that you want me
<br>
my mind goes blank
<br>
i just sank
<br>
right into your open arms

<p>

i remember all the good times we had
<br>
it makes me so sad
<br>
to recall what we had
<br>
had between us
<br>
nothing could keep us apart
<br>
you always had a place in my heart
<br>
a place to go when you are down
<br>
when you a hurt
<br>
when you need someone to love
<br>
i am allways here
<br>
even though
<br>
you have a shadowy grave

<p>

if i could only bring you back
<br>
before this time bomb 
<br>
goes off in me
<br>
before the next revolution
<br>
I try
<br>
oh god I try
<br>
to redeem myself
<br>
but i need your help
<br>
what do i do
<br>
what do i say
<br>
i will never know
<br>
because you have a shadowy grave
<p>
