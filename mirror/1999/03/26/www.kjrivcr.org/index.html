<font size="+1">Have you ever noticed that all the hacked boxes nowadays are linux machines?  Annoying is it not?  I am not talking about the boxes being hacked, I am talking about the clueless admins..
<br>
Take this machine for instance.. the guy is running every service available .. and there is a root bash shell running on port 4444.. somone finally found the machine and started using it to scan 134.84.0.0 thru 134.255.255..
<br>cute, eh?<br>
Well, this machine is 0wn3d like all the others.. go use solaris or something.. now it is free... so all you whiney linux bastards can suck a nut.<br>
