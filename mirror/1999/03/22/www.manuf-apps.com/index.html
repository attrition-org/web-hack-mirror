<b>14 And Dead</b>
<p>


your in the prime of your life
<br>
it's supposed to be the best years 
<br>
of your life
<br>
but when you step back and look 
<br>
at your life
<br>
it's just an illusion

<p>


your dying
<br>
and you fight to stay alive
<br>
you struggle to breath
<br>
your dying
<br>
and your soul lifts from within
<br>
it's flying away
<br>
your dying
<br>
and you try to persue it
<br>
only you cant move
<br>
because your dying
<p>



you see your whole life 
<br>
flash before you
<br>
every thing is getting blury
<br>
you see two hall ways
<br>
one with a bright white light
<br>
and the other a dark scary look
<br>
a voice tells you to take the right road
<br>
so you start toward the white light
<br>
but something is sucking you back
<br>
back the black hole
<p>



you start to scream "lord i'm sorry"
<br>
then a white figure appears
<br>
and takes you in its arms 
<br>
leads you to the light
<br>
the light of happiness
<br>
the light of joy
<br>
the light you persue

<p>
