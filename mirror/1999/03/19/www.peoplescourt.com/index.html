Youve been owned by ne0h and gH. You will learn to bow down.
<br>
Even though im not a hacker, nor wish to be one, I still like to put lame people in their place.
<br>
I happen to be telecommunications for global hell [gH], and dont mingle with their programming, hacking, or other basic things.
<br>
I am simply ne0h, no if's, and's, or but's.
<br>
Id like to let you all know, that gH owns all the low life mother fucking skank whores that flame us and say we dont have skill.. even the non-hackers of gH can still fucking own things.. 
<br>
so shut the fuck up.
<br>
bitch.
<br>
shout outs will proceed as requested:
