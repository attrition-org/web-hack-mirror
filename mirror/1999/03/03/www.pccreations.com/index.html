<h3>RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY - BOYCOT INTEL!</h3><br>
<br>
<p>
The newly released INTEL PENTIUM III chips contain an internal PSN (Processor Serial Number) which can be read remotely by websites. This is to be used to identify you in eCommerce activities.<br>
Unlike cookies, this PSN can't be removed nor changed. So once someone got your PSN, they will allways know it's you.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Do we have to take it ? NO WE DON'T#@&!<br>
Personally, we like our privacy. We don't want to visit a website and let the webmaster know who we are.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Intel also claims this PSN will be positive for Internet Security. Anything but that. Hackers have already been able to forge the PSN, thus undermining the system.
</p>
<br>
<p>
What is the point in all of this ?
</p>
<br>
At the end, it's up to you to decide. Customers make the products. If you decide NOT to buy the p3, Intel MIGHT get smart and remove the PSN. Let your voice be heard! <b>REACT!</b><br>
