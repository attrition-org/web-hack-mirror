<h1>THE HACKED LEUTE.AT SITE</h1><br><br>
<br>
The Team is back and is once again to speak about the major injustices done to the world today.<br>
Is it privacy intrusion ? Human rights ignorance ? No. It is something far more dangerous. POLLUTION.<br><br>
Since the beginning of mankind, we have been polluting this planet. We have thrown away whole regions of woods, we have rendered water sources unusable. Big companies are getting away with it like it's nothing.<br>
I don't give a fuck about what you do to YOUR world, but unfortunately it is MY world too, so STOP POLLUTING IT.<br>
<br>
As if that wasn't enough... now let's go and pollute the rest of the universe !!<br>
Sattelites, MIR, all funky shit, technology rocks, but the atmosphere is already polluted with shitloads of junk (sattelite remainings, etc), and we haven't done dick yet. WHAT'S GOIN TO HAPPEN WHEN WE "CONQUER" SPACE?<br>
<br>
That was it for today. I hope you sleep well at night knowing that when the polar ice caps melt, all city's below 50 metres above the sea will vanish. Goodnight.<br>
