  "Persist to resist, fight back - not with a fist, but <FONT
COLOR="blue">tact</FONT>"</FONT><BR> <BR> Our country has become a
laughing stock.  We can no longer respect the leader of our country.  Come
to think of it, when could we respect Clinton?  If you look at his
history, you will realize what a disgraceful character is in office today. 
Tonight we were once again reminded of the whole Monica Lewinsky fiasco by
CNN.  And that brings us to the next part of this page.</BR> <font

</CENTER> <BR> <BR> <BR> <B><U>A Few Words By <FONT COLOR="BLUE"
SIZE=+4>Cyrus</FONT>:</U><B> <BR> <BR> <CENTER> <font size="5"> I was
watching the Lewinsky interview on TV tonight and it made me sick. The
whole situation makes me sick.  What has happened to this country?  The
president is supposed to be a role model for the youth of america and what
does he do?  He had sexual relations with a woman other than his wife and
lies about it to the entire nation, hiding behind carefully put words. 
What the President is doing is illegal, immoral - just plain wrong.  He
should not be allowed to get away with what he has by using expensive
lawyers and fifty dollar words.  Yes, he is the President of the United
States of America, but more importantly he is an AMERICAN and when
Americans commit crimes they are punished as they should be.  Perjury is
no small offense; by letting the President get away with this makes me
lose all faith in our legal system.  Worse yet is the media attention this
situation is getting, such as allowing Monica to expose on national
television very private details of the president's life and the life of
his family.  </CENTER>

<BR> <BR> <U>More from <FONT SIZE=+4 COLOR="purple">MagicFX</FONT></U>: 
<CENTER> <BR> I personally think it was disgusting how, despite the
obvious fallacies in Clinton's defense, the media made him look so great. 
The news media certainly has a lot of power.  (Hollywood is similar -
remember how nobody cared about Tibet before "Seven Years In Tibet"?)  So
an issue here is that if we place the President above the law (if <FONT
SIZE=+3 COLOR=WHITE><B>I</B></FONT> commit perjury, I go to jail.), what
is happening to our country?  Frankly, I'm scared.  Also, don't be fooled
into thinking Clinton cares about our country.  He doesn't. The President
of the "USA" is much more interested in bringing about a One World
Government than making America a country worthy of international respect.
A "New World Order" may not be far off.  It is certainly being planned. 
Why do you think Clinton is so friendly with Russia (the "fall of
Communism" in Russia is basically a myth) and China?  There is simply too
much to explain for me to sum it all up here.  Don't believe everything
you hear from the media.  Money runs everything right?  Who is to say
that the media is not controlled?
