Exploit: Microsoft Frontpage Extensions:
<BR>
<BR>
By allowing the directory /_vti_pvt to be placed into your server site directory your site is being put at
serious risk of damage.<BR><BR>
By entering the location of http://www.yoursite.com/_vti_pvt in a web browser anyone will be given access to
password files *.PWD files including your username and password for your FTP.<BR><BR>
There is mimimal threat at this stage as the password is encrypted for instance<BR><BR>

username:P2Tsx6IpVcDvO or <BR><BR>username:P2Tsx6IpVcDvO:0:0:comments:/:/bin/bash <BR><BR>

However by entering this form of encryption into an extremely well known password cracker/decryption program 6 times out of
10 your password will be retrieved, with your  username and password available the cracker can access the same
functions as what you can do when logged in.
<BR>
<BR>
The simplest way to oppose this flaw is to completely remove your /vti_pvt dirctory, finding the *.PWD files is just one
of the flaws, there are others which can be found within them certain locations.
<BR>
<BR>
I would suggest a security check/update in the not so distant future as childish unexperienced crackers are quickly exploiting
this factor. As of this page, no damage was done to your server or content however there have been many attempts to access your FTP by other users.
