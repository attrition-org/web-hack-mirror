<b>Fighting is not something to be proud of, but someone has to do it.</b></h3></center>

<ul>Biological weapons, chemical weapons, and nuclear weapons, none of
these can stop us... For we are not here, yet we sit before our computers
and proceed with such malicious activities. Cyberspace is a new battlefield
and we have the advantage. Our advantage is not experience or weapons,
but we have the will to push us and the morale to keep fighting until the
end. You can kill us, imprison us, and torture us but we will <b>never</b>
give in.
<p>The image that your government gives us is an obese little techo-nerd
that wants revenge for all of the bullies that picked on us is school.
None of this is true... Our cause is to wake you up from the fake reality
that they have put in your minds, to let you see the real world and to
experience the poverty, war, and ailments that is happening right now.
The government created us and now they want to destroy us. In the end,
it's reality you have to face, not what the government gives you. We are
doing this for the people who cannot fight for themselves and those who
neglect the fight for the helpless.
<p>Our time is coming soon. Our front is gaining more territory every minute.
The government can put all their men on the front lines, but we can walk
right through them. When we reach the central government we will stop...
For we cannot go any further. <b>But Why?</b> The government has filled
your heads with so many lies that the people will stop supporting us. The
time is now, wake up, face the truth. We are not the enemies, it is you,
your neighbor, and the people who supposedly protect you. Join us and regain
the freedom that is rightfully yours.

<p>Thanks to our premature reporting of your security bug, further complications
have been avoided. Malicious hackers with bad intentions could have destroyed
your entire Internet Service that would leave the customers with no other
choice then to switch to another ISP. Therefore we fixed your bug because
you would never have figured out how to secure it.
