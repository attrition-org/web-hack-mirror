Multinationals, big corporations, the powerfull people, never use their power.<br>
They abuse it. Their only gain is their personal profit. The don't give a damn about<br>
how other people are. What would it concern them ?<br>
This is a good question.<br><br>
The casual people, the people who supposedly have nothing to say, do have something to say.<br>
Our voice counts for as much as the one's of the powerfull people. These people make it seem<br>
asif we do not have a choice, asif we have to do what they are commanding us to do. WRONG.<br>
WE have our OWN will, our OWN freedom. Freedom is a special thing assured to us by the consitution.<br>
haha - yeah right. That's what we're supposed to believe. The same government that assures us this<br>
freedom is taking it away when we turn our back. We live in a system with 3 branches of government,<br>
3 chances to make something out of it for the people. Then why wont it work??<br>
<br>
Freedom belongs to the people who will not waste it, eventhough mistakes are humain.<br>
The government does not deserve the freedom and support we give it. They have been misleading us<br>
ever since they saw that taking freedom away was good for their own gain. They watched Russia do it,<br>
now they're watching China in full effect doing it. Russia went down just because of a lack of freedom.<br>

<b>Do you want your country to go down as well??</b><br><br>
