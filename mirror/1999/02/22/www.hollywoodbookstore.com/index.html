<P><BR>I woke up this morning, with a clear mind, a clear vision, with
my eyes wide open.
<BR>Yet something blurred my sight.. Something that shocked me.. I knew
what it was, but
<BR>I didn't dare to face it. Reality freaked me out. A reality of going
to school every
<BR>morning and taking crap from teachers that you hardly don't know..
that don't know you
<BR>or that you've never met before. And yet we're so far apart.. I do
not despise these people, nor
<BR>do I wish them well or ill. I just wished everything was back to normal..
back to the old days
<P>Out here, we don't treat eachother like strangers.. nor do we despise
oneanother.
<BR>Here, my eyes are not blurred anymore.. they are open, wide open, without
any rippels in my line of
<BR>sight. Eventhough we've never seen eachother, or never talked to eachother..
we know eachother
<BR>better then the teacher in school who makes me believe that <B>his</B>
class is the most important, and
<BR>that <B>his</B> life is the center of the universe. Choose a future,
choose a past, choose life.
<P>Equality is one of the virtues of mankind.. maybe you cannot see it,
but i can. Some people unfortunately
<BR>think of this equality of non-existant. But I can see it, and you should
too.
<BR>The only thing you have to do is opening you eyes.
<P>In the end.. after you take a cold shower, it's a shame to realise that
your entire life went through
<BR>the drain just by not opening your eyes. Don't make the same mistake
most people make.. don't be tempted
<BR>by easiness. We do not choose this road because it is easy, we choose
it because it is hard.
<P>Stop blindly following others, choose your own road, make a damn difference!!
<P>Life is there to make something out of it.. do not wash it through the
drain.
<BR>It does not necessarily mean that when you're fighting against an enemy
of whom you think you
<BR>can't win, that you don't stand a chance of beating him. The cause
is there and so are the means
<BR>the only thing you have to do is open your eyes and cease them.
