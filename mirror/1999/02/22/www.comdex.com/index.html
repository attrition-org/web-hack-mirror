      <p>This site was hacked by the boys (and girls) of E-pRoM. Why? To make 
        a simple statement. Keep the true human spirit. Keep life unpredictable. 
        Keep life ALIVE.</p>
      <p>OK, so what do we have here? The mighty Comdex falls to a relatively 
        small &quot;hacker group&quot;. Proof positive that even the Goliaths 
        of our online world can fall to a &quot;David&quot; every once and a while. 
        Another example of the gaping holes that exist in the internet's structure.</p>
      <p>The chances are, that you have paid a grossly inflated price for a software, 
        or hardware, product simply because you WILL pay that amount. Computer 
        software and hardware is worth billions, people. You ARE being ripped 
        off. We have a situation in which software giants are slowly closing down 
        your options as a consumer, just as your option of OS is pretty much decided 
        for you before you even buy your box.</p>
      <p>MP3s, now here's a touchy issue for the powers that be. The giant record 
        companies are pretty upset right now. Their little monopoly of not only 
        the music market itself but the population's taste in music isn't just 
        dwindling, it's being executed by the true human spirit. DON'T LET THE 
        RECORD COMPANIES GET THEIR WAY. Don't let them crack down on MP3 distribution. 
        MP3s are beautiful, they reward the intelligent and resourceful, and put 
        an end to overpriced CD buying. Perhaps most importantly, they put an 
        end to who, and what style, will be heard by the masses. Bands/DJs/Musicians 
        no longer have to conform to the sellable qualities and styles that major 
        record companies have imposed to ensure sales. Music is part of the human 
        experience, share it, publish it for free, live free.</p>
      <p>Shoutouts to all those who converse with the |[Ep]| crew, both those 
        who help us, and those who hinder. We're all playing the same game....
