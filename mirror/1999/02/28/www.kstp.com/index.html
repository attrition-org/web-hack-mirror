Earlier I hacked the St. Paul Library, but it didn't seem to get noticed. So I thought this'd work better.

A few people thought Jesse made some comments that were 'not Politically Correct'. First the Irishmen joke, and Norm Coleman's rant about his comments about Indians. Can't we let such trivial matters pass? How would you feel if someone quoted every slip of tongue you ever made? If you listen hard enough you will find innapropriate comments in the daily comments of ANY individual. This should not be such a big deal. Everyone makes mistakes.

First off, they were not meant to be 'offending'. Get over it; move on. 
Second, he's the most decent person to have in office compared to all
the other spineless, status-seeking politicians out there. He actually
has the guts to speak his mind, and not worry about who's funding him.
<br>If you can't get over the such minor crumbs, what does
that say about yourselves? You won't realize what you have until it's
gone. He's trying to bring back some of the freedom that has been
lost to red tape over the years.
<p>
There, I made my comment, and I'm probably screwed for it. Ah, but the price to pay to speak freely.

Note: No, this was not funded by Jesse Ventura or anyone/organization related to him. So don't get
on the bandwagon that it was. 
Move on with your lives.
