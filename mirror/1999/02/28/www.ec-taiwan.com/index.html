<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">Yeah i know.. this is getting irritating..<br>
I 'explored' 20 randomly picked NT servers&nbsp; running IIS..<br>
Used a searchengine with keyword 'iisadmin'.<br>
8 of them found&nbsp; have really poor security, defeated<br>
with ease using some exploits..<br>
Some are even worse.. like this one.</p>

<br>
This was my last hack.. i'm getting bored. (3 is a nice number..)<br>

Just delete the index.html and rename the default.html to index.html....<br>
Everything will be cool again.<br>
