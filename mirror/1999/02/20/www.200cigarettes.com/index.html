<p><b><u><font size=+4><font color="#330033">Crappy Movies</font> - <font color="#3333FF">Frequently
Asked Questions</font></font></u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Why does MTV suck?</font></b>
<br>MTV sucks because they play crappy videos and they have stupid television
shows which are harder to watch than the insipid movies they endorse. The
only programing station worse than MTV is WB. I often wonder what is harder
to watch: MTV's The Real World and its cast of cretins or Moesha. That's
probably because I watch too much TV to begin with. But that's another
issue all together.
<p><b><font color="#CC0000">Y</font><font color="#FF0000">ou guys seem
pretty knowledgeable about what sucks and what doesn't, where can I talk
to you guys to find out more?</font></b>
<br>irc.psychic.com It's cool there. Uhm, yeah.
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Why did you guys hack the 200 Cigarettes web
site? The movie isn't even out yet.</font></b>
<br>Because we know it will suck. MTV endorses it, thusly, it sucks. Courtney
Love is in it, thusly, it will suck. Robert Deniro is not in it, thusly,
it will suck. It's another Gen-Xish type movie that I find very insulting.
What ever happened to quality movies about serial killers and mobsters
blowing each other up? I don't give a shit about some crappy bar scene
in some far away, imaginary candyland that Paramount created to make them
millions of dollars off rich, suburban white kids with too much time and
apparently too much money on their hands.
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Who is that guy on MTV's Road Rules that wears
the r00t hat?</font></b>
<br>No clue. But whoever he is he's not a very snappy dresser and he seems
to have a little trouble in social situations. He also seems to have difficulties
communicating effectively with the sista among them. I like how MTV always
sticks in their token black person, or token asian person, or token gay
person, to fill the show out so it's a little more P.C.. It's pretty cool
how there's always some white person that likes to fight with the token
black person all the while MTV capitalizes off of it. And, honestly, would
you wear that r00t hat in public? If the answer is yes, please stop reading
this, get up, go outside and lie down in the street until a car runs you
over and your brains squirt out all over the road causing many accidents
and traffic delays. Because you are a dork.
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Where should I go to meet you guys again?</font></b>
<br>irc.psychic.com
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Aren't you guys going to speak spanish and
talk about Venezuela or some other opressed South American country?</font></b>
<br>Yes. Arriba la raza. Yo quiero Taco Bell. And free Venezuela or something.
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Who else should we free?</font></b>
<br>Kevin Mitnick, Mumia Abu-Jamal and Truman. Oh wait, Truman got out
at the end. Okay, scratch the Truman thing. I wonder how much Jim Carrey
got paid for that movie. I'm sure it's too much.
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Courtney Love is looking kinda skanky, how
do you guys feel about her doing movies?</font></b>
<br>The People vs. Larry Flynt was good, with no thanks from her, if ya
ask me. Courtney Love is not only a crappy actress, but she's a crappy
singer/guitarist and her band sucks too. Kurt Kaboom wasn't as great as
everyone thinks as well. Neither was Tupac now that we're on the subject
of celebrities who have died from gunshot wounds. Stupid celebrities.
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">What other celebrities died of gunshot wounds?</font></b>
<br>I don't know. I think that guy who played Hogan on Hogan's heroes did.
JFK did. Abraham Lincoln, does he count? Robert Kennedy. Biggie Smalls.
The old bass player from Metallica had a bus fall on his head. That's kinda
cool. Does he count?
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Where again?</font></b>
<br>irc.psychic.com
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Will you guys keep on hacking movie sites to
tell us they suck?</font></b>
<br>Most likely.
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">You guys rock, can I have your autographs.</font></b>
<br>No.
