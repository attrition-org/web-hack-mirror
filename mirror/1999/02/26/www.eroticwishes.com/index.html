When I said an 18 Only to Enter Link. I meant a little more than that.
<BR>
Go to a real page and find out how they do it. No Samples. No 
<BR>
Uncensored pictures on the main page. Theirs no point to having
<BR>
an 18 only to enter link on the same page as the thing you're supposed 
<BR>
to be blocking from little childrens eyes (if you can call an 18 only
<BR>
link prevention). I don't understand why the online sex industry is 
<BR>
allowed to do all that they do while kids aren't allowed to buy dirty
<BR>
magazines in the store. I'm not advocating the sale of magazines to 
<BR>
children. I'm advocating some reform when it comes to online sex. 
<BR>
The best idea I think is credit card verification or something similar.
<BR>
"But what about privacy?" you may ask. That is bullshit. I hate it 
<BR>
when people say they want more privacy and more freedom of speech. 
<BR>
The door swings both ways. The government is not the only people who
<BR>
can twist the meaning of this right. And as for people who worry about
<BR>
Spam? Mabye we should crack down on companies who spam also. For instance
<BR>
AOL regularly deletes the accounts of users who spam. But these are
<BR>
usually stolen accounts anyway and five minutes later the person is 
<BR>
spamming again. Don't go for the little fish spammer. Go for the source.
<BR>
Go for the companies who pay the spammers. Anyway.. that's my two cents.
<BR>
If you have any comments then write em in my guest book.

Now for the morons who run this page.
<BR>
You know once your page is taken down then you're SUPPOSED to change 
<BR>
your password! That's the FIRST thing you do. Hopefully the chuckleheads
<BR>
who run this site will realize that this time around. Greets to Rita, Kray
<BR>
and Greg. 
<BR>
<BR>
Also big greets to Magica Despell. Next time we go for the number one dime!
