<p><big><big><big><font color="#004080">It's funny how a lot of people who hack pages like
to flame other people who do the same thing. I am new to this field and so I guess it
would be improper to make any direct statements but why can't web crackers mind their own
business instead of flaming a fellow web cracker. I think NYS have a very good point. But
then I guess flaming is seen as cool behavior by some people. Also some people like using
junk characters like 3,0 etc. to represent alphabets. But then each guy has his own style
I guess. I don't want to continue too long so I part now but before that I would like to
greet NYS for making some very correct and shrewd observations. The sysadmin need not
worry too much. Your original index.html has been renamed as elmer.html.</font></big></big></big></p>
