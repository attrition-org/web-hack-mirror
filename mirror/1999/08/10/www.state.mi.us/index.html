Technologies, we are a new group, but, our members are not new to
the scene. We will not be anonymous, but our members names will
not yet be revealed at this time. We will also not just be
another kiddies group doing just defacements all day long, yes we
will do some, but, we are also hoping to be coming out with some
security related programs in the near future. Well thats about it
for now. -Uneek Technologies-</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF8040"><em>Kevin Mitnick's four
and half year ordeal is getting closer to the end. Having already
spent more time behind bars than most people convicted of
burglary or manslaughter, Kevin may possibly be released to a
halfway house by January. U.S. District Court Judge Marianna
Pfaelzer sentenced Kevin to 46 months in prison and ordered him
to pay $4125 in restitution. This sentence comes after numerous
delays and a guilty plea by Kevin for seven felonies. Today's
sentence comes just one day after the LA District Attorney
decided to drop the state charges against Kevin. </em></font></p>
