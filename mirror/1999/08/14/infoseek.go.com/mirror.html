infoseek.go.com received an interesting hack of sorts. Attempting to search
for anything would potentially yield a defaced page. The person reporting
the hack to the Attrition staff received it after 5 searches. We tested it
and received the defaced page on the first search attempt. This page stands out
in comparison with their normal pages.

This was the resulting URL after our search that lead to the defaced page,
although attempting to go directly to it does not yield the page:
