        district attorney drops Mitnick case</font></b><font face="Americana"><br>

        <p><font face="Americana">The Los Angeles district attorney gave Kevin
        Mitnick a birthday present Friday, dropping its six-year-old computer
        hacking case against the convicted hacker.</font>
        <p><font face="Americana">That development could speed the release of
        the 35-year-old, removing an obstacle that could have prevented Mitnick
        from going free from federal prison soon after he is formally sentenced
        Monday in an unrelated federal case.</font>
        <p><font face="Americana">&quot;We're ecstatic,&quot; said Carolyn Hagin,
        one of Mitnick's attorneys in the state case.</font>
        <p><font face="Americana">Deputy District Attorney Daniel Bershin said
        he dropped the state case because it had been &quot;mischarged.&quot;</font>
        <p><font face="Americana"><span class="msubhead3">Dubious 'computer'
        crime</span><br>
        In 1993, the district attorney charged Mitnick with one count of
        illegally accessing a Department of Motor Vehicles computer and
        retrieving confidential information. The problem with that charge is
        that Mitnick, posing as a Welfare Fraud investigator, simply picked up a
        telephone on Dec. 24, 1992, and duped an employee accessing the DMV
        computer for him.</font>
        <p><font face="Americana"><ZD-TALKBACK>
        </font>
        <p><font face="Americana">&quot;Since Mitnick did not personally connect
        to the DMV computer, but either he or someone else communicated with the
        DMV technician via a telephone conversation,&quot; Bershin wrote in his
        motion to dismiss the case, &quot;it would be difficult to prove that
        Mitnick gained entry to the DMV computer, or that he instructed or
        communicated with the logical, arithmetical or memory function resources
        of the DMV computer.&quot;</font>
        <p><font face="Americana">Bershin also confirmed at a July 28 hearing
        what many of Mitnick's supporters have been claiming for years: that
        their martyr has been the target of overzealous prosecution.</font>
        <p><font face="Americana">Bershin first informed Los Angeles County
        Superior Court Judge Leland Harris of the district attorney's intention
        to drop the case at the July 28 hearing, a position that caught Harris
        off guard.</font>
        <p><font face="Americana">As early as July 7, Deputy District Attorney
        Larry Diamond -- who had originally handled Mitnick's case -- was
        vigorously arguing against any reduction in Mitnick's $1 million bail
        pending trial.</font>
        <p><font face="Americana"><span class="msubhead3">Judge 'curious'</span><br>
        &quot;So I'm curious as to why all of a sudden between July 7 and July
        28 we have this radical change in position,&quot; the judge asked of
        Bershin.</font>
        <p><font face="Americana"><MUSTSEE1>
        &quot;Well, I think to be quite candid, the answer, or course, is Mr.
        Diamond,&quot; Bershin said. &quot;I know that Mr. Diamond has wanted to
        handle this matter personally for a long time ... and I know that Mr.
        Diamond personally believes that Mr. Mitnick has been skating through
        the system for a long time and has a great interest in him.&quot;</font>
        <p><font face="Americana">At that July 28 hearing, Harris refused to
        dismiss the case, saying to do so would be &quot;a radical jump off the
        precipice to move to dismiss at this time.&quot; He ordered Bershin to
        submit a written motion to dismiss, which Harris granted Friday.</font>
        <p><font face="Americana"><span class="msubhead3">Halfway house an
        option</span><br>
        Harris' action clears the way for Mitnick's freedom. He is due to be
        sentenced in federal court for several hacking charges he pleaded guilty
        to in March. His attorney in the federal case, Donald Randolph of L.A.'s
        Randolph &amp; Levanas, said he will ask Central District Judge Mariana
        Pfaelzer to order Mitnick into a halfway house after formally sentencing
        him to 68 months in prison.</font>
        <p><font face="Americana">Randolph said he is optimistic Pfaelzer will
        grant the request, but if she doesn't Mitnick is set to go free sometime
        in January.</font>
        <p><font face="Americana">Still at issue is the amount of money Mitnick
        must repay in restitution. His victims, including several high-tech
        giants such as Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq:<a href="http://www.zdii.com/industry_list_new.asp?mode=news&amp;ticker=sunw">SUNW</a>)
        and Motorola Corp. (NYSE:<a href="http://www.zdii.com/industry_list_new.asp?mode=news&amp;ticker=mot">MOT</a>),
        say that Mitnick's hacking cost them millions of dollars in compromised
        intellectual property.</font>
        <p><font face="Americana">Federal prosecutors are seeking $1.5 million
        in restitution. Mitnick, through Randolph, argues that he is leaving
        prison broke and that conditions of his probation, once he is released,
        severely restrict his access to a computer, the only way he knows how to
        make a living.</font>
        <p><font face="Americana">Pfaelzer has indicated that she will order
        Mitnick to make some restitution, which she is scheduled to decide
        Monday as well.</font>
        <p><font face="Americana">Mitnick was arrested in 1995 after a
        high-profile, two-year, electronic manhunt for him.</font></p>
