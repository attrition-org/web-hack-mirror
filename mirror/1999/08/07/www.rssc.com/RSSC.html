<P>Radisson Seven Seas Cruises is the fourth largest luxury line, operating and
marketing the six-star, 350-guest <I>ssc Radisson Diamond</I>, the six-star, 180-guest <I>m/s Song of Flower</I>, and the 320-guest
<I>m/s Paul Gauguin</I>, which entered service in January 1998 as the most deluxe cruise ship ever based in Tahiti and French Polynesia
year-round.  The line also markets the five-star, 188-guest <I>m/s Hanseatic</I>, one of the most luxurious adventure cruise ships in the world.
And, beginning in August 1999, Radisson Seven Seas will launch its newest ship, the <I>m/s Seven Seas Navigator</I> in the same six-star
tradition.  Only Radisson Seven Seas Cruises offers such a broad spectrum of distinctive vessels and voyages, while upholding an
uncompromising standard of cruising excellence throughout, to each destination, aboard each of our ships. </P>

<P>It’s no wonder that the readers of <I>Cond&eacute; Nast Traveler</I> chose Radisson Seven Seas Cruises as the &quot;World's Best Cruise
Line&quot; for 1995.
  The <I>Radisson Diamond</I> and <I>Song of Flower</I> have been awarded a six-star rating by <I>Fielding’s Worldwide Cruises</I>, 1999.
  <I>Song of Flower</I> has been voted &quot;Best Cruise Value&quot; in luxury cruising for seven consecutive years by <I>Ocean &amp;
  Cruise News</I> (1992 – 1998) and in its first year of service, the <I>Paul Gauguin</I> has been given a six-ribbon rating by <I>Stern’s
  Guide to the Cruise Vacation</I>.  Radisson Seven Seas Cruises was also honored with the &quot;World’s Best&quot; award in the
  small cruise line category by <I>Travel and Leisure</I>, 1998. </P>
