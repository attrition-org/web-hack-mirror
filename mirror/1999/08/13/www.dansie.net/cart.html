<LI>Requires <B>no major changes to your site</B>.
<LI>Unlike some shopping cart software programs, the Dansie Shopping Cart has no limit to the number of items you want to sell with it from your web site.
<LI>It keeps track of the products and prices and automatically calculates shipping, tax and the total for your customer's convenience.
<LI>It allows <B>multiple payment options</B> in order to be flexible for both your customer and you the merchant. You may choose to use any or all of the following five payment options:

The Dansie Shopping Cart has a side-kick <A HREF="existing_ssl.html">SSL script</A> that will securely accept credit card numbers. It's a separate script in the case that your secure host is remote. Credit card orders may be either emailed to you or appended to a data file on your host that you can access with your FTP program. <IMG SRC="images/new.gif" ALT="New!" BORDER=0> The ssl.pl script works with <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp.html" TARGET="pgp">PGP 2.6.2 and 5.0</A> on Unix and Windows NT hosts.
