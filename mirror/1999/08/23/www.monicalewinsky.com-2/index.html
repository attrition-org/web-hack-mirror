<h1><center>Greetings bastards.</h1>
<p>                     Over the last few months,  we have been lead to 
believe that Slobodan Milosevic , the leader of the former Yugoslavia is 
the worst violator of Human Rights in the world.  Well, that isn't an 
entirely true statement.  Although Slobodan Milosevic is a huge violator 
of Human Rights, there is a much bigger problem in China, and it's been 
going on for decades.  However, the politicians of America decide to 
overlook their violations just because of large campaign contributions 
and trade value.
                                                Since the days of the 
Carter administration China has been openly abusing its people.  They 
limit how many children a family can have , and how the people can live 
their lives.  The Chinese government kills anyone who opposes or speaks 
out against it.  The Chinese government defies international Human Rights 
laws openly and admits to it.  The Chinese government has a worse Human 
Rights record than Slobodan Milosevic ,  yet nobody questions them.  Just 
last month , its been reported that political prisoners in China have 
been subjected to sexual tortures and later executed.  In fact, earlier 
this month, President Clinton actually had Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji to 
the white house for talks on entering the World Trade Organization.Bill 
Clinton even said at a press confrence with China's Premier Zhu Rongji 
,"We honor China's remarkable achievements, its greater prosperity and 
the greater range of personal choices available to its citizens, as well 
as the movement toward local democracy".  When in fact there has been no 
change in China's view of human rights. The Chinese Government has placed 
severe restrictions on freedom of speech, the press, assembly, 
association, religion, privacy,  as well as worker rights. Also , China 
has the most favored nation trade status.  All of this has a lot of 
people wondering why there is a war in Yugoslavia , but none in China.  
However the answer to that is all too apparent , greed.
                                                It is true that Slobodan 
Milosevic, and his army, are carrying out horrible acts against people.  
They aren't being condoned at all.  But, China engages in these same 
activities on a much larger scale, and just because they have money it's 
deemed acceptable by American political and corporate interests.   Bill 
Clinton was eager to wage war when it would take the focus off of his 
bedroom practices, but he isn't so eager to do so when it will cost him 
valuable campaign contributions, and who knows what else.  The Chinese 
people have attempted to cry out for help through The Internet and 
televison shows.  However those caught emailing anyone outside of China 
are immediately imprisoned .  Chinese Internet access is limited very 
strictly to pro-chinese sites, the government prevents anyone inside 
China from viewing anything else by cutting off the outside Internet.  
This is comparative to Slobodan Milosevic's use of the television to only 
display movies and shows which he chooses, or for him to spread political 
lies about other nations.  However , there is one difference between 
China and Yugoslavia's use of censorship.  China is a valuable trade 
nation, so there's must be all right , at least that's the message that 
is sent out by the United States Government.  A lot of Human Rights are 
asking how these two nations , with very similar tendencies can be 
treated so much differently.  Perhaps if China would have been the only 
ones in violation around the time of the Monica Lewinsky scandal things 
would be different.  Or perhaps if they didn't have so many large 
investments in American corporations and government they would be being 
punished for their actions.  It's terrible that Human Rights is like a 
commodity , to be sold to the highest bidder.  

                                                     In the end it all 
seems to be just another example of money controlling everything.  As 
long as someone turns a profit, it's acceptable.  But what if someone 
were getting right, by letting your government mistreat and abuse you?

You would probably expect someone to stand up and defend you.  But how 
can anyone expect that if they wont extend the same courtesy to someone 
else?   Innocent people are allowed to be executed and persecuted just 
because their government can pay for it.  It saddens me deeply to see 
that more people haven't taken a stand against the Chinese.  But most 
people figure that since it isn't them it doesn't really happen.  They 
think that if it were really that bad , something would have been done 
about it.  They don't have the time to worry about other people.  They 
sit back and watch the Politicians of America line their pockets with the 
blood of the Chinese people.  It's become more and more apparent that 
society has no regard for the feelings and well being of others.   But 
what if your freedom and rights were just dollars in someone else's 
pocket, and you lived as the Chinese people do.  Things would probably be 
a little different then, at least in your eyes. </p>
