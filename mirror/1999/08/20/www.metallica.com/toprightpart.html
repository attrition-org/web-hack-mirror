<font size=2 color="#FFFFFF">This site has been hacked to let you know that Metallica, although a great metal band (metal is used for lack of a better term) isn't the only metal band around. It is ok with me that rock/metal isn't dominating radio and TV anymore. But I'm sick of big businesses trying to alter our taste for music and fashion. Check out Anthrax, maybe some new music from an older mature band will make our miserable 9-5 working, over taxed, over regulated, commercialized, pasteurized, politically correct lives a little more tolerable.<br>

Decide for yourself what the next 'in thing' for you is, don't wait for eMpTy-V, or some other corporate cheese-ball establishment to tell you what it is. <br>
