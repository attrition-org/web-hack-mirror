<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>Since Max obviously has no clue as to how to set up a Web server,
he'll have to have you e-mail him, and then manually unzip the damn file.&nbsp;
Scary as hell when some dumbass redneck in Jooooja attempts to run a Web
server.&nbsp; Did you know he had the entire...and I do mean ENTIRE...server
set up as shared?&nbsp; Over the Internet, no less!&nbsp; Jesus H. Fucking
Christ!&nbsp; And FULL ACCESS to the NT default guest account with NO PASSWORD.&nbsp;
Only a complete MORON would do something so fucking stupid.&nbsp; NT is
bad enough, but did you people know he had your credit and checking info
on here?&nbsp; Don't worry, it's been deleted.&nbsp; However, you're all
going to have to change your passwords.&nbsp; He had it in a \usr directory.&nbsp;
Dumbfuck.</CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>I mean, it's obvious that you're an&nbsp; inbred KKK wannabe, Max,
with absolutely no ability to set up a server, and yet, one would hope
that you would strive to attain more with your life.&nbsp; Read Bugtraq,
NT Bugtraq, and get a real server.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; I just don't know
why I even bother.</CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>However, there is hope for our boy Max.&nbsp; It seems that he
has a taste for Pr0n (not misspelled.&nbsp; Hackers are supposed to spell
things this way) and he might just be a little limp around the wrist.&nbsp;
Lookie what I found hidden in his c:\temp3 directory.</CENTER>
