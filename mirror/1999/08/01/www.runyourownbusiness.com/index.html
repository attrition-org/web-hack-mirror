<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" SIZE=3 FACE="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I'm the CEO of a new group called "PulseWidth".. nothing more than defacing websites and rooting poorly secured *nix systems..  but we're a business.<BR>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, we don't pay taxes and we don't have medical coverage, but we do have fun.  What could be better than that?  Someone once said "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.." .. but he was wrong..  I want to see what my country can give to me.. <P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money, isn't that what it's all about?  Well I'm not making any, but I'm making progress..  but just to prove it to you, I'll finish this page with some complements we've recieved worldwide!<HR WIDTH=29%><P>
