a group they once were in. boooy... buncha smart guys there. <p>

speaking of ne0h (a well known ./ hacker, mr. i-scan-for-all-my-hacks himself), it seems that 
he is sending threating emails to other hack groups. well, fl3m in particular. lets see how cool 
mr ./ne0h is shall we?<p>

erm, you guys suck.<BR>
thats our opinion. enjoy it.<P>

And you better remain anonymous.. because once we find you we will make you <BR>
obsolete like DigiAlmty, gH, and F0rpaxe.. the people who decided they <BR>
wanted to be elite, doing the same stupid things over and over again. We <BR>
owned AntiChrist, now he's hiding, yet still defacing.. funny how that <BR>
works. HFD knows that we will smack them if they come out in the open.<BR>
One of the keebler elves, just one.. could own your entire group, so be <BR>
careful and stop being so fucking lame.<BR>
