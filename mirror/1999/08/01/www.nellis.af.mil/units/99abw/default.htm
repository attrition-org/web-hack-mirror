        99th Air Base Wing (ABW) had its beginnings as the 99th Bombardment Group in 1942 at Gowen
        Field, Ohio. In 1943 air operations moved to Algeria, when the unit distinguished itself
        while flying bombing missions against targets in Italy, Sardinia and Sicily. In 1943 the
        99th aircrews moved to Italy and flew missions throughout Europe.</font></p>

        inactivation, the 99th was redesignated the 99th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) from 1947
        to its inactivation in 1949. The 99th was reactivated in 1953 as the 99th Strategic Wing,
        based at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington. Although the years brought several changes
        in name, equipment and missions along with a move to Westover Air Force Base,
        Massachusetts in 1966, the organization operated until a second inactivation closed the
        doors in 1974.</font></p>
