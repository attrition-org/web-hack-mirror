         Religious Groups' Attitudes Toward Homosexuals and
         Homosexuality</B></FONT></P>
         
         <P><B>Conflicts between Organized Religion and
         Society</B></P>
         
         <P>The points of greatest tension between Christianity and
         secular society appear to be related to human sexuality:
         abortion, bisexuality, erotic and pornographic material,
         homosexuality, premarital sex, married clergy, female
         clergy, sex-education, availability of condoms, debate over
         which types of families should be accepted as families,
         defined roles for men and women, and even the existence of
         free (nudist) beaches. Of these, perhaps only abortion is
         more divisive than the debate over sexual orientation.</P>
         
         <P>Sexual orientation relates to feelings. It defines who a
         person finds to be sexually attractive. Human sexuality
         researchers, professional organizations and liberal relgious
         groups appear to have reached the consensus that:</P>
         
         <UL>
            <LI>heterosexuality, bisexuality and homosexuality are
            normal, natural variations of sexual orientation, found
            throughout all societies and cultures</LI>
            
            <LI>sexual orientation is determined before a child
            reaches school age</LI>
            
            <LI>sexual orientation for many (perhaps most) is
            genetically predetermined at conception</LI>
            
            <LI>sexual orientation in adults is unchangeable</LI>
            
            <LI>a continuum exists between homosexual and
            heterosexual orientation; a minority of people have a
            bisexual orientation</LI>
            
            <LI>through effort, prayer and counselling, an adult's
            behaviour can be changed:
            
            <UL>
               <LI>the possibility of leading a celibate life is open
               to all</LI>
               
               <LI>bisexuals can lead celibate lives or can decide to
               confine their</LI>
               
               <LI>sexual interaction with same sex or opposite sex
               people</LI>
            </UL>
            </LI>
         </UL>
         
         <P>Many conservative Christian churches have reached a
         different consensus, that:</P>
         
         <UL>
            <LI>homosexual behaviour is evil, sick, disordered and
            abnormal</LI>
            
            <LI>only heterosexual behaviour is ordained by God;
            homosexual and bisexual behaviour are sins</LI>
            
            <LI>sexual orientation is a choice that a person
            makes</LI>
            
            <LI>sexual orientation is determined by upbringing,
            (perhaps by parenting) not by genes</LI>
            
            <LI>ssexual orientation can be changed during
            adulthood</LI>
            
            <LI>ssexual behaviour can be changed; homosexuals (for
            example) can decide to remain celibate, or seek sexual
            relationships with either males or females</LI>
            
            <LI>one is either homosexual or straight</LI>
         </UL>
         
         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <P>Main-line and liberal churches typically hold positions
         between these two extremes. The conflicts between medical
         science and conservative Christianity are obvious.</P>
         
         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <P><B>Internal Church Conflicts</B></P>
         
         <P>There are some interesting theological questions relating
         to homosexuality and bisexuality:</P>
         
         <UL>
            <LI>if one believes in an "intrusive" God who
            micro-manages everyone's life, and if at least some
            people's sexual orientation is decided at conception,
            then why does God create so many homosexuals? What is His
            purpose for doing so? By what right can we reject a whole
            grouping of people created by God?</LI>
            
            <LI>if one believes that God is all powerful, and that
            God answers prayer, then why have the earnest prayers of
            homosexuals always been ignored? Some devout gay and
            lesbian Christians have begged God for years to make them
            "straight" without success.</LI>
            
            <LI>if homosexual orientation is a natural condition for
            a minority of people (just as heterosexual orientation is
            natural for the majority), and God has given to most
            people the ability to love and desire marriage, then
            shouldn't all people be allowed to marry, independent of
            their orientation?</LI>
         </UL>
         
         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <P><B>Incidence of Homosexuality within Churches</B></P>
         
         <P>Members and leaders of some conservative Christian
         churches believe that they have few or no members or staff
         who are homosexuals. Evangelicals Concerned, a group which
         believes that there is no conflict between Biblical faith
         and a committed, monogamous homosexual relationship, believe
         the opposite: that gays and lesbians are as common within
         conservative churces as within the general population.
         (1)</P>
         
         <P>There is really no way to collect accurate statistics on
         the prevalence of homosexuality within churches. Both
         members and employees would be reluctant to reveal their
         orientation because they would fear being expelled if they
         came out of "the closet". One interesting statistic comes
         from Love &amp; Action, an Evangelical agency which
         ministers to persons with AIDS. They went into about a dozen
         Christian colleges during 1990 and offered confidential
         counselling to those who were struggling with homosexual
         feelings. About 4% of students signed up. They estimate the
         total number of such students to be at least 8%, presumably
         because of fear of being exposed and a lack of trust in the
         agency. These data would indicate that the prevalence of
         homosexual orientation might be higher in Christian colleges
         than in the general population. (1)</P>

         <P><B>Christian Churches' Policies on Homosexuality</B></P>
         
         <P>Each Christian denomination, sect or new religious
         movement has policies which define their beliefs and
         treatment of homosexuals and bisexuals:</P>
         
         <UL>
            <LI>A. whether to allow known, active homosexuals to
            become and remain church members with full privileges.
            (All churches, of course, have many homosexual members
            and clergy who are deep in the "closet"; their sexual
            orientation is not openly known, so they "pass" as
            straight).</LI>
            
            <LI>B. whether to allow celibate homosexuals to be
            ordained or to hold other positions of power in the
            organization</LI>
            
            <LI>C. whether to allow active gays and lesbians to be
            ordained or to hold other positions of power</LI>
            
            <LI>D. whether to provide a formal religious ceremony
            recognizing gay and lesbian committed relationships</LI>
            
            <LI>E. whether to have an active program to reduce
            homophobia within the denomination</LI>

         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <P>Churches currently hold different views. Many
         denominations are gradually changing their positions to a
         more inclusive stance. We are unaware of any religious

         <P><B>What does the Future Hold within Christendom?</B></P>
         
         <P>Many gays and lesbians remain partially or completely in
         the "closet". They often find the Church as the last place
         that they would want to "come out", because of the fear of
         rejection and homophobia. This is unfortunate, because the
         most effective way of changing a heterosexual's beliefs
         about homosexuality is for them to meet a homosexual. This
         is a Catch 22 situation.</P>
         
         <P>If you are a heterosexual and know a gay male or lesbian,
         we suggest that you talk to them about their sexual
         orientation and the attitude of your church(es). If you do
         not know such a person, we recommend that you read a letter
         from a gay person to his church council. It might help you
         to empathize with the pain felt by devout Christian
         homosexuals.</P>
         
         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <P>We predict that over the next few decades, most Christian
         denominations will gradually accept the following
         beliefs:</P>
         
         <UL>
            <LI>a continuum of sexual orientation exists, from
            heterosexual to bisexual to homosexual</LI>
            
            <LI>adult sexual orientation is unchangeable</LI>
            
            <LI>orientation is determined genetically in some people
            at the time of conception.</LI>
            
            <LI>sexual orientation in adulthood is established by
            early childhood.</LI>
            
            <LI>since sexual orientation is not a matter of choice,
            homosexual and bisexual feelings are not sinful.</LI>
         </UL>
         
         <P>Eventually, all churches are expected to follow the lead
         of the United Churches, Unitarian-Universalist churches,
         Neo-Pagan and some Native faiths. They will accept gays,
         lesbians and bisexuals as full members and as ligible for
         the clergy. As with many previous issues of social change,
         from the abolition of slavery to birth control to women's
         rights, the liberal churches will lead; Fundamentalist
         churches will be the last to convert.</P>
         
         <P>Eventually, sexual orientation will become a non-issue.
         Discrimination against minority sexual orientations will be
         perceived as institutional hatred, and totally incompatible
         with the Gospel message. Unfortunately, this process will
         take many decades to complete. In the meantime, much
         suffering and many suicides will be experienced by the gay,
         lesbian and bisexual community, and gay-bashing will remain
         at a high level.</P>
         
         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <P><B>Jewish Groups</B></P>
         
         <P>Jewish groups tend to mirror Christian denominations,
         ranging from liberal to conservative:</P>
         
         <UL>
            <LI>Orthodox Jews regard homosexual behaviour as "an
            abomination"</LI>
            
            <LI>Conservative Jews did not tackle the issue until
            1990, when the Central Conference of American Rabbis
            voted to recognize the equality of all members,
            regardless of their sexual orientation. They also went on
            record as favoring the decriminalization of homosexual
            activities between consenting adults, and the passage of
            laws which prohibit discrimination against gays and
            lesbians.</LI>
            
            <LI>Reform Jews do not consider sexual orientation when
            ordaining rabbis, and do not require their rabbis to
            follow a celibate lifestyle.</LI>
         </UL>
         
         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <P><B>Traditional Native American Groups</B></P>
         
         <P>In many aboriginal traditional faiths, homosexuals are
         held in high regard as having received a special blessing.
         They often became the shaman (healer) of the community.</P>
         
         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <P><B>Asatru, Druidic, Wiccan and Other Neo-Pagan
         Groups</B></P>
         
         <P>These religions are almost completely decentralized in
         organization, so no one person or organization speaks for an
         entire faith group. Many, perhaps most, Neo-Pagans are
         solitary practitioners. Others are organized into Churches,
         Covens, Groves, Kindreds, etc. Although Pagans celebrate
         female-male polarity, and many of their rituals are based on
         a balance of women and men, they generally accept
         homosexuality and bisexuality as natural and unchangeable
         orientations for a minority of adults. Most groups welcome
         people without regard to their sexual orientation. There are
         also exclusively gay and exclusively lesbian groups.</P>
