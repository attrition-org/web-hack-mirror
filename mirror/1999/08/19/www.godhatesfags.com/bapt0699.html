         <B>HRC DENOUNCES DIVISIVE ANTI-GAY RESOLUTION AT SOUTHERN
         BAPTIST CONVENTION</B> <BR>
         SBC Wrong To Further Poison The Climate Against Gays As Hate
         Crimes Increase, Says HRC <BR>
         <BR>
         WASHINGTON -- The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) today
         passed a resolution that condemned an official proclamation
         by President Clinton that declared June 1999 "Gay and
         Lesbian Pride Month." The SBC also passed a resolution
         demanding a recall on James Hormel's recess appointment as
         the ambassador to Luxembourg. The mean-spirited resolutions
         are a gratuitous attack on gay and lesbian Americans,
         furthering an atmosphere of mistrust and intolerance at a
         time when hate crimes are on the rise, according to HRC.
         <BR>
         <BR>
         "The resolution is wholly lacking in anything akin to
         spirituality rooted in love. In the aftermath of Columbine
         and the murders of people like Matthew Shepard, James Byrd
         and Cassie Bernall, you would think the Southern Baptists
         would be focused on ways to heal our communities, not divide
         them," said HRC Executive Director Elizabeth Birch. "The
         role of spiritual leaders should be to build safe, common
         ground in troubled times. But this resolution pits one group
         of people against another and singles out gay and lesbian
         Americans for discrimination." <BR>
         <BR>
         The Rev. Wiley Drake of First Southern Baptist Church in
         Buena Park, Calif., submitted the resolution disapproving of
         Clinton's proclamation. The resolution says "that any
         proclamation which acts to affirm, approve or endorse
         homosexual behavior is contrary to God's law. And, be it
         further resolved that we discourage all Americans from
         observing this month in any way, other than to pray for the
         repentance and salvation of those caught up in this sinful
         lifestyle." <BR>
         <BR>
         The SBC is upset over Clinton's June 11 proclamation that
         praised the gay and lesbian fight for equality and
         commemorated the "Stonewall Uprising". In a written
         statement, Clinton made history, becoming the first
         president to proclaim June "Gay and Lesbian Pride Month." "I
         encourage all Americans to observe this month with
         appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that
         celebrate our diversity, and to remember throughout the year
         the gay and lesbian Americans whose many and varied
         contributions have enriched our national life," the
         president wrote. <BR>
         <BR>
         "We are tremendously gratified that President Clinton has
         used the honor and authority of his office to recognize the
         significance of one of our community's most cherished and
         historic events," said Birch. "This proclamation is a
         testament to the nearly 30 years of hard work by activists
         and it certainly gives us something to be proud of in this
         year's Pride celebrations." <BR>
         <BR>
         The SBC also passed a resolution calling for the recall of
         Ambassador James Hormel. Hormel, a supremely qualified
         nominee, was denied a Senate vote because he is gay. Clinton
         nominated Hormel in 1997. The nomination was approved by the
         Senate Foreign Relations Committee last fall but had been
         stalled by several senators who raised objections to his
         support for lesbian and gay equal rights. The right-wing
         campaign to stop Hormel's nomination was led by Sens. James
         Inhofe, R-Okla., Bob Smith, R-N.H., and Tim Hutchison,
         R-Ark. <BR>
         <BR>
         Hormel is a prominent civic leader and former diplomat. He
         served as an alternate U.S. representative to the United
         Nations General Assembly and as a member of the U.S.
         delegation to the U.N. Human Rights Commission. His
         supporters include Sens. Joe Biden, D-Del.; Orrin Hatch,
         R-Utah; Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; as well as Secretary of
         State Madeleine Albright and former Reagan administration
         Secretary of State George Shultz. <BR>
         <BR>
         The anti-gay resolutions are the latest in a series of
         Southern Baptist Convention anti-gay initiatives and
         activities. The SBC launched an ill-fated boycott against
         Disney in June, 1997. Among the factors contributing to
         their decision were Disney's willingness to allow gay people
         to visit its theme parks and its policy of extending equal
         benefits to the domestic partners of its gay and lesbian
         employees. <BR>
         <BR>
         The denomination was founded in 1845 when the Baptist
         churches in the South withdrew from the national Baptist
         body called the General Missionary Convention. The split was
         caused when the Convention supported and biblically
         justified the right of its members to own slaves. Over a
         hundred years after the fact, in 1995, the Southern Baptist
         Convention formally repented their history of bigotry and
         oppression based on race. <BR>
         <BR>
         "We look forward to the day when the Southern Baptist
         Convention will repent their homophobia, and learn that
         among the greatest of sins is hate," said Birch. The renewed
         SBC attack on gay people comes at a time when hate crimes
         are becoming more lethal. <BR>
         <BR>
         A recent survey released by the National Coalition of
         Anti-Violence Programs showed an alarming increase in the
         brutality of hate crimes with an unprecedented rise in the
         use of weapons in the assaults. Hate crimes based on sexual
         orientation were up 8 percent in 1997, according to the
         latest FBI statistics. Sexual orientation was the third
         highest category of hate crimes behind race and religion and
         represented 14 percent of all hate crimes reported. <BR>
         <BR>
         The Human Rights Campaign, the largest national lesbian and
         gay political organization, with members throughout the
         country, effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign
         support, and educates the public to ensure that lesbian and
         gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at
         work, and in the community. </P>
