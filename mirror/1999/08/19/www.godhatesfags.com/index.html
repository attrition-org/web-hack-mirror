This was not a true defacement, but interesting to note. Internic is still
succeptable to social engineering attacks.

A statement from the owner and webmaster of GodLovesFags.com

On the evening of August 17, 1999 we received an anonymous email telling
us to "pay close attention to the godhatesfags.com Internic information
over the next few days."

On August 18, 1999 at approximately 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, ownership of
the domain name www.godhatesfags.com was transferred to the owner of
GodLovesFags.com. While we are not aware of exactly how the domain was
transferred, please note that it was by no action of our own. We received
an authentication email from the Internic verifying the transfer. From the
appearance of the headers on the authentication e-mail, the transfer was
both authentic and legal. 

DNS information for www.godhatesfags.com was then set up point to
www.godlovesfags.com. We did not hack any servers or web sites. We did not
hack any email systems. We rerouted a domain name that had been
transferred to our ownership. 

When GodLovesFags.com was born on March 1, 1999 it was our intent to put
up a positive, affirming site that could serve as a resource to gay,
lesbian, straight, bisexual and transgendered persons of faith.
GodLovesFags.com is a non-denominational, non-discriminatory web site. Our
intent is to share a message of God's love with people who have
traditionally been inundated with a message of hate - and to monitor the
actions of those who spew hate in the name of God. As the site continues
to grow, we constantly ad links to information on other faiths and even
opposing viewpoints from time to time. We don't assume to tell anyone how
to think, we are simply a resource. 

For more information on the background of GodLovesFags.com, contact us at
the above email addresses.
