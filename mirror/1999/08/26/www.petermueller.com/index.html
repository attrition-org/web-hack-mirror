<p>Hello all. Well, HiP was talking about me, so I thought I'd
let you all know that I do exist.. (No, HiP isn't quite crazy
enough to make up people). hehehe... Anyways, you all know me, a
lot of you greet me, but some reasons I needed to change
identity's, sorry folks! It's not a secret who I used to be, but
I'm not going to tell you in a defacement (Other places... sure,
but not HTML). So here is me, your mission.. Should you choose to
accept it.. Is to dig up who I am, and contact me over E-Mail,
demasking me. Well sorta. Anyways, this was just to prove that I
do exist. Oh, and by the way, if you could stop greeting the old
me, I'd appreciate it. Sorry people, I needed to do this, I feel
like I'm turning my back on you, but I'm still alive, I'm just
not the usual me. The layout of this page gives you a lot of
hints.</p>

<p>To Peter, sorry about this dude, I hope you don't lose a job,
the lack of security in your page has nothing to do with your
Architectural skill. To the company that is looking at this, if
you are looking at this, please forgive me. I must have done this
at the wrong time. Your index.htm is now, index2.htm, no harm
done I hope... If there's anything wrong, (other than the hack)
e-mail me, and I'll see what I can do... Sorry once again.</p>
