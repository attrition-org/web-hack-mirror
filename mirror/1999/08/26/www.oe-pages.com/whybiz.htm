</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are six great reasons to buy a premium account. We
will be constantly adding features to this list and you will always have access to them at
no extra charge. 

<ul>
  <li><strong>You get a nice short web page address like uhpage.com/yourname<br>
    </strong>instead of oe-pages.com/COMMUNITY/District/yourname</li>
  <li><strong>200 Rewards Points</strong><br>
    Not only do you get 200 points for becoming a premium member, but you'll also get points
    everytime you update your page or refer any new members. These points can be used to buy
    advertising on our site, great exposure for your site!!</li>
  <li><strong>You get to submit your page to all the best search engines in one easy step. </strong><br>
    ( Note: search engines, do not automatically know when a new page is on the web, you have
    to tell them, our form makes this process super easy )</li>
  <li><strong>You get to place Meta Tag Keywords into the source code of your page.</strong><br>
    ( Note: Most search engines look at&nbsp; meta tags first to determine the ranking of a
    web page when someone does a search. The good news is that most people either don't know
    what a meta tag is, or don't know how to implement them. You will get to input your
    keywords into our easy form, and you will have a leg up in the battle for search engine
    ranking)</li>
  <li><strong>Web Uploaoder Access</strong><br>
    If you have web pages already written and just want to upload them as an extension to your
    page, you can. Maybe you've got some java applications, whatever it is you can use the Web
    Uploader. &nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
  <li><strong>It's only $25 !!!<br>
    </strong>This is a one time only fee, <strong>NOT</strong> monthly. </li>
</ul>

<p><br>
Also, more options for the premium account are on the way......

<ul>
  <li><p align="left"><strong>More web design options</strong><br>
    Using our automated creator will be more versatile. You'll be able to have photo album
    style pages, and lots of other different templates to choose from.<br>

</ul>
