      <strong>August 7, 1999<br>
      </strong>I am a middle school teacher and wanted to thank you for offering the service! I
      love my web page and can't wait to give the address to my students to visit. I also gave
      the Create Uh Page address to several co-workers who now also have their own web page and
      they love it, too. Thanks,<br>

      </strong>Hi! I just had to tell how great your service is! It's quick, easy, fun, and
      free! I thought you would have to have a great knowledge of computers to make and manage a
      web page but you have proved me wrong! I have made many web pages using your wonderful

      </strong>I just wanted to say &quot;Thank you&quot; for my site. It was the easiest thing

      </strong>This is just to say that Create uh page is fantastic! For people like us that are
      not well versed in HTML, this is really easy. We just wanted a small page to entertain our
      friends, and it's great. <br>
      Thanks!<br>

      </strong>Thanks for the opportunity to make my own web page. I am a teacher and I plan on
      using this a lot. I will spread the word about your service to everyone I talk to about
      web pages. It was fun to create and very easy as well. It is a very impressive service. I
      will make it available to my school district as soon as the snow melts allowing us to go
      back to school!! My brother and sister-in-law teaches in separate districts, so I will get
      the word into their districts as well. Keep up the good work. Let me know of any new
      things available to me through your site!!<br>
      Your Friend,<br>

      </strong>Hi, I want to congraulate you on your great service of Create uh Page. It is a
      wonderful place to get a free page. It's quick and easy, and no hassle at all! I
      especially love the images and music, and so do my friends. The create-your-own-password
      part is wonderful, so that I can now remember my own password, and not some jumbled code!
      Keep the great work up! Oh, and check out my site, that I made of your pages...and please
      leave me a message in the guestbook! <br>

      </strong>I would just like to thank YOU &amp; the company for the page. I've tried others
      before &amp; all they managed to do is confuse me (so much so I withdrew the pages.) I
      found your system to be so easy and honest, even a seven year old could use it. Thanks so
      much for giving me my chance to be on the web. I also have a question. my father &amp; I
      use the same computer. Is there anyway he can get his own web page through you also ? Or
      is it just one per computer?<br>
      Thanks again,<br>

      <p><strong>November 3, 1998<br>
      </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being somewhat of a computer aficionado, I was given a
      homework assignment by a friend's daughter, who needed to know how to create a Web page
      for a class she was taking. I had NO clue how to even begin, but I stumbled on your Web
      site and am so glad I did! Your service is the best I've seen, and I thank you for saving
      my skin!<br>
      Gratefully, Shelly</p>

      <strong>October 22, 1998<br>
      </strong>I shifted to your service to start my internet business because you offered more
      options than all the others that I have delt with and right when the hits were increasing,
      my page was gone for over two weeks. That was quite a blow to me. I was in high gear to
      change all my satellite pages that pointed to my main pages.The hits have dropped off from
      what they were but, I am sure that I will rebound shortly as long as you are able to stay
      online as you say. Thank you for not just disappearing off into cyberspace.<br>
      Sincerely, Steve</p>

      Thanks for the cool updates. I feel like your communications with your clients are all so
      personalized and helpful. I never thought using a sevice like this would feel like a
      comfortable place to go to. Everyone else I have ever tried seemed so impersonal.<br>
