</p>
<p><b>A :&nbsp; </b>All you have to do is type the web page address given to
you,&nbsp; in any<br>
browsers address bar.&nbsp; You type it in the same place you type to see any<br>
other web page on the internet.&nbsp; If you still don't know where to type the<br>
address.&nbsp; Ask a friend or relative.&nbsp; I'm sure someone you know will be
able<br>
to tell you where to type your address in.
</p>
<p><b>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Q :&nbsp; Is Create Uh Page really a free service, I mean, what's the catch?</b>
</p>
<p><b>A : </b>
      No catch, any individual or business can have a page for free. We have a
Premium<br>
service that our users can take advantage of at a cost, but the pages themselves are in<br>
fact free.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<b>Q : How much space can I have?</b>
</p>
<p><b>A : </b>
    While we have no pre set size limits, we will remove a site that we feel is abusing<br>
our generosity. If you are truly using all of your space for good content then you have<br>
no worries about size restrictions.
</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p><b>Q :  I lost my username, password, and page address!  What do I do?</b>
</p>
<p><b>A : </b>
     Click on edit uh page. Click on free member pages or premium member pages<br>
which ever&nbsp;
you are. Underneath the username and password login there is a box where<br>
you can enter your&nbsp;
e-mail address.  Submit it and we will send you your page address,<br>
username and password.&nbsp;<br>
If that doesn't work you can send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@oe-pages.com">support@oe-pages.com</a>&nbsp;
Please<br>
try the above first before you send an email to support.&nbsp; We are heavily
bombarded<br>
with email from people not knowing their username, password, and web page
address.
</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p><b>Q :  I can't get into my web page, and I feel like I'm typing the address right?</b>
</p>
<p><b>A : </b>
      Make sure you're typing the address like this one here, this is just an example.<br>
<a href="http://www.oe-pages.com/COMMUNITY/District/username">
      http://www.oe-pages.com/COMMUNITY/District/username<br>
</a>
      Your address is very case sensitive.  It must be typed in the same case as this.<br>
      If your page still doesn't work even after typing it correctly.  Then your page<br>
      must not have saved correctly and you'll have to make a new one.<br>
<br>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p><b>Q :    Why when I look for my page in a search engine it doesn't show up?</b>
</p>
<p><b>A : </b>
     Search engines don't automatically know when a new web page enters the web.<br>
You have to tell them. There are hundreds of search engines, but only about 7 or so<br>
that really matter. You can announce your web page to the search engines two ways;<br>
one is to go to each search engine and fill out their forms or you can hire someone to<br>
announce your page to all the engines easily. With Create uh Page, you can announce&nbsp;<br>
your page to the top engines, and put in meta tags (keywords.)   This only costs you&nbsp;<br>
$25 and is part of our premium account. You can sign up for a premium account after<br>
making a page, or when editing your existing page. Please note that the time it takes for<br>
your site to appear in the search engine varies from one to the next, be patient , it can&nbsp;<br>
sometimes take up to a month.
