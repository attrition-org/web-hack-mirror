<h2 align=center>What can I do with this form?</h2>

<p>This form is an interface to Netscape's Logfile Analyzer.  Place it and
the analyzer binary in a directory accessible to your server and you can use
it to get valuable information from your log files.</p>

<p>Remember that the analyzer also has a powerful command line interface,
so that you can set up a cron job to run nightly and produce these reports.</p>

<form method="POST" action="a_form.cgi">

<h2 align=center>System information</h2>
<p>Here is where you tell the analyzer where to find the log files, and what
your server's name is.</p>

<hr>

<h3 align=center>Server Name</h3>

<p>List here the name of your server, as you want it to appear on the 
report.</p>

<hr>
<pre>Server name: <input type=text name=server_name size=25 value="WWW Server"></pre>

<hr>

<h3 align=center>Output type</h2>

<hr>
<input type=radio name=use_html value=1 checked> Output in HTML<br>
<input type=radio name=use_html value=0> Output in plain text

<hr>
<h3 align=center>Output / Input files</h2>

<p>Specify here the log file you wish to analyze (required) as either an
absolute path or as a relative path from the location of this form.  You
can also specify an output file - or, if you leave that entry blank, the
results will be printed to your screen.</p>

<pre><hr>
   Log file: <input type=text name=input_file value="/local/ns-home/httpd-80/logs/access"> 
Output file: <input type=text name=output_file value="">
</pre>

<hr size=3>

<h2 align=center>What to report</h2>

<p>The logfile analyzer can produce many different statistics about your
server's load and usage patterns.  You can configure exactly what you
want to see, and what you don't want to see.  You can even configure the
order in which you see it.  Generating less information also makes the
analysis use less memory.</p>

<!-- counts -->
<hr>

<h3 align=center>Totals</h3>

<p>The logfile analyzer can generate totals of certain statistics on your
server, such as the total number of requests made during the period in
the log file, total number of unique URL's, and total number of unique 
hosts.  It can also track how many kilobytes were transferred, and how
many kilobytes were saved by Netscape's cache.</p>
<pre><hr>
<input type=radio name=count_items value=0> Do not generate totals.
<input type=radio name=count_items value=1 checked> Generate totals for:
  <input type=checkbox name=count_hits value=1 checked> Total hits
  <input type=checkbox name=count_304 value=1 checked> 304 (Not Modified) status codes
  <input type=checkbox name=count_302 value=1 checked> 302 (Redirects) status codes
  <input type=checkbox name=count_404 value=1 checked> 404 (Not Found) status codes
  <input type=checkbox name=count_500 value=1 checked> 500 (Server Error) status codes
  <input type=checkbox name=count_urls value=1 checked> Total unique URL's
  <input type=checkbox name=count_hosts value=1 checked> Total unique hosts
  <input type=checkbox name=count_kb value=1 checked> Total kilobytes transferred
  <input type=checkbox name=count_cache value=1 checked> Total kilobytes saved by caches
</pre>

<!-- time -->
<hr>

<h3 align=center>Time statistics</h3>

<p>This section allows you to list the times of the day when your server
handled the heaviest load.  It also lists how many connections occurred 
during that time and how much data was sent.</p>

<pre><hr>
<input type=radio name=time_stats value=0> Do not generate time statistics.
<input type=radio name=time_stats value=1 checked> Generate time statistics:
  <input type=checkbox name=time_seconds value=1 checked> Find top <input type=text name=seconds_num value="5" size=5> seconds of log
  <input type=checkbox name=time_minutes value=1 checked> Find top <input type=text name=minutes_num value="5" size=5> minutes of log
  <input type=checkbox name=time_hours value=1 checked> Find top <input type=text name=hours_num value="24" size=5> hours of log
</pre>

<!-- lists -->
<hr>

<h3 align=center>Generate lists</h3>

<p>You can also have the server generate a list of how many times each URL
on your server was accessed, and make a list of all the hostnames and IP
addresses that accessed your server.  You can have it list only a certain
number of entries, or, you can have it only list the item if more than a
certain number of requests were made for (or by) it.</p>

<pre><hr>
<input type=radio name=list_items value=0> Do not generate any lists.
<input type=radio name=list_items value=1 checked> Generate lists of:
  <input type=checkbox name=list_urls value=1 checked> Most commonly accessed URLs:
    <input type=radio name=list_utype value=0> <input type=text name=list_uonly value="5" size=5> most commonly accessed URLs.
    <input type=radio name=list_utype value=1 checked> URLs that were accessed more than <input type=text name=list_umore value="5" size=5> times.

  <input type=checkbox name=list_hosts value=1 checked> Hosts most often accessing your server:
    <input type=radio name=list_htype value=0 checked> <input type=text name=list_honly value="5" size=5> hosts most often accessing your server.
    <input type=radio name=list_htype value=1> Hosts that accessed yout server more than <input type=text name=list_hmore value="5" size=5> times.
</pre>

<!-- output_order -->
<hr>

<h3 align=center>Output Order</h3>

<p>Finally, you can control the order in which the analyzer prints the data.
Enter a "1" for the first item to print, a "2" in the second, and a "3" in
the third.  If the item should not be printed, don't include its number.</p>
