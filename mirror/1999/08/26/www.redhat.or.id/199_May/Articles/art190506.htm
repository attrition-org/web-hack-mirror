    <p><em>Summary<br>
    In this first column aimed at those new to Linux, Rick Cook tackles the questions: What
    exactly is a Linux distribution? Is it the same as a version? Are all distributions
    created equal? Will software written for one distribution run on all others? (1,300 words)
    By Rick Cook </em></p>
    <p>Distributions offer many new Linux users their first glimpse at what makes Linux
    different. In the Linux world the cake is free -- and standard. It's the icing that's not
    standard, and it doesn't have to be free either. </p>
    <p>At the heart of Linux is the kernel and filesystem -- the basic, fundamental parts of
    Linux. This core is distributed under a license, under terms that require it to be
    provided in its entirety, with source code, to anyone who wants it. With it, you also
    normally get an extensive suite of software tools and utilities written by the Free
    Software Foundation's GNU project, which began developing its own version of Unix way back
    in 1984. The GNU software suite includes several shells (or command-line interfaces), a
    C/C++ compiler, the X Windows windowing system to provide a mouse-and-icon interface, and
    so on. </p>
    <p>On top of this -- the icing, if you will -- is the software, added by each distributor
    (the Calderas and Red Hats of the world). This is the stuff that distinguishes one
    distribution from another. In the case of commercial vendors, this is where the
    distributor tries to add enough value to make you purchase its version of Linux. </p>
    <p>Distributions aren't versions in the sense the rest of the computing world understands
    the term. The kernel and filesystem are the same, and a lot of the surrounding material,
    such as the X Window System, is the same. You see the difference in the installation
    program, which processor is supported, and added material. Price varies as well, from free
    for download, to just a few bucks for a CD-ROM and book, to over $200, depending on what's
    included and the intended market. </p>
    <p>There are between one and two dozen English-language Linux distributions available, and
    a number of non-English distributions. (See &quot;Linux Online&quot; in the Resources
    section.) The distribution suppliers range from highly professional companies looking to
    make big bucks in the Linux industry to hobbyists releasing their own distribution just
    for fun. </p>
    <p>Different distributions exist for different machines. Power Mac, Alpha, and UltraSPARC
    boxes are all supported by a number of different distributions, and some differences exist
    between Intel distributions. For example, some versions are designed to run on any Intel
    processor from 386 up, while others are tuned and optimized for the Pentium. A couple of
    distributions are even designed to fit on a single floppy disk. </p>
    <p>While the different varieties of Linux available are distributions rather than
    versions, each new release of the Linux kernel is called a new version. In general, you
    want to get the most recent version of the kernel possible, but this usually doesn't have
    anything to do with the distributor you choose. What's more, your distribution's version
    number generally bears no relationship to the kernel version number. For example, Caldera
    OpenLinux 1.3 features the Linux kernel version 2.0.35. Got it? </p>
    <p>The important thing to remember is that if your distribution has a 2.something kernel,
    you're probably fine. </p>
    <p>You don't have to buy a distribution, of course. Let's not forget that Linux is free;
    you can download the kernel, filesystem and other parts at no charge. However, if you
    chose to do it yourself, you're pretty much stuck with the job of making sure you have all
    the parts you want and installing them properly on your computer. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Three reasons to buy something that's free</p>
    <p>If do you purchase a distribution, you're really buying three things: ease of
    installation, a limited degree of support, and additional software. </p>
    <p>Painless installation is important, and a lot of Linux vendors have gone out of their
    way to make sure their customers get it. They include scripts, installation programs, and
    other features to get you up and running as painlessly as possible. They also try support
    as much hardware as they can. Red Hat Linux has a reputation for being especially strong
    in the area of installation, as does Slackware. </p>
    <p>In general, Linux is easy to install using these installation features. I got my first
    distribution (Slackware 3.5) up and running in about 20 minutes, thanks to the
    installation program. However, the installation routines do hide a lot of the complexity
    inherent in a multitasking, multiuser operating system. Sometimes things don't work the
    way they should, especially if you deviate from the well-trodden path and choose to do a
    custom installation. That's where support comes in. </p>
    <p>Between vendors, you'll see considerable difference in the level of installation
    support. Some, like Caldera and Red Hat, offer support for a limited period to help users
    get Linux installed. Others take the attitude that you're on your own. If you're
    experienced with Unix or Linux (or can get to the appropriate Internet newsgroups to ask
    questions) you can probably overcome any roadblocks you run into. For the rest of us, that
    support-desk telephone number is very comforting. </p>
    <p>The included software makes good marketing copy, but it's less important than ease of
    installation and support. With Linux, almost all the software is available for download
    somewhere. If there's a tool or utility you want, you can probably find it for the cost of
    a download. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Interoperability</p>
    <p>Will software written for one distribution of Linux run on another? The answer is
    generally &quot;Yes, but..&quot; As long as both distributions were written for the same
    processor, you can probably get the software to work. There are, however, a couple of
    caveats. One is that due to differences in various utilities, file structures and such,
    you may have to do some tweaking. For example, you may have to edit the installation
    script to allow for different filenames or directory names in different distributions. In
    some cases, you may have to recompile the application, which is a pain if you've never
    done it before. </p>
    <p>Linux distributions are probably going to get easier to use in the near future. Whether
    this is a good thing or not depends on how you view Linux. </p>
    <p>What we're probably going to see is the emergence of one or two de facto standard
    versions of Linux, with many distributors falling by the wayside. This will make things
    better for Linux users, especially beginning users, but it will cost the Linux community
    some of its vitality and make Linux a less exciting, innovative platform. Linux is
    unlikely to settle into something like Windows, but it probably will change as it matures.
