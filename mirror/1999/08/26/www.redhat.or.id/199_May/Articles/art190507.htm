    In this issue, Mark Russinovich talks about </p>
    <p>Linux and the Enterprise.</p>
    <p>Hello all,</p>
    <p>Linux has received considerable attention from the trade press and major computer
    companies over the past several months. More and more, you see the word
    &quot;enterprise&quot; in a headline with Linux. For example, &quot;The Enterprise Comes
    To Linux,&quot; &quot;Enterprise Vendors Line Up Behind New Red Hat Linux
    Distribution,&quot; and &quot;Major Players Bring Linux to Enterprise&quot; are all recent
    headlines from popular trade rags. Major players in the computer world, such as IBM, HP,
    and Compaq, have announced formal support for Linux, and have begun selling hardware
    preinstalled with Linux. The ties between Linux and enterprise computing extend to
    software vendors who have announced Linux ports for applications common in the enterprise.
    Oracle has ported its database offering to Linux, IBM has ported DB2, and enterprise
    resource planning (ERP) solution providers are porting, or considering porting, their
    applications to Linux. </p>
    <p>The promotional momentum behind Linux as an enterprise-ready OS gives the IS community
    a sense that Linux is a suitable enterprise OS that has passed the scrutiny of
    enterprise-savvy hardware and software companies. However, no evidence exists that these
    companies or the trade press has looked at Linux critically with respect to its
    enterprise-class capabilities. Enterprise-class environments don't widely use
    Linux--corporate environments have only just put Linux to use as a uniprocessor server OS
    in the past year or two. To date, not one Linux benchmark submission to the Standard
    Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC) or the Transaction Processing Council (TPC) has
    shown that Linux offers performance comparable with what commercial versions of UNIX and
    Windows NT deliver on large workloads. In fact, there are no SPEC or TPC benchmark
    submissions with Linux as the OS. The phrase &quot;enterprise computing&quot; means
    different things to different people. Some see enterprise computing as a client/server
    environment where many clients, or users, rely on few servers to provide computing
    services. Thus, an enterprise environment is one that demands hardware resources to handle
    large workloads that basic PCs just can't support. My interpretation of the phrase defines
    an enterprise-class OS as one that must deliver high performance in high-load
    environments, scale well on multiprocessors, provide reliable service, and have high-
    availability options built-in or that exist as add-ons. Example enterprise environments
    include running an email server that supports several thousands of users, hosting a Web
    site that processes hundreds of thousands or millions of requests per day, and maintaining
    a database that serves as a corporate data repository with thousands or tens of thousands
    of employees. </p>
    <p>A common theme to all these interpretations is that enterprise computing involves a
    network server application with high compute and I/O demands, and that server reliability
    and availability are of utmost importance to a company's bottom line. Another common theme
    is that the necessary hardware typically consists of a multiprocessor system with two to
    eight processors, 1GB or more of RAM, and dozens of GB of disk space: Uniprocessor
    departmental servers, small Web sites, and casually used company servers are not the
    enterprise. What lies beyond these requirements is the high-end of the enterprise
    (requiring more than eight processors). That space probably accounts for less than a
    fraction of 1 percent of the computing in the world and is reserved for mainframe OSs such
    as OS/390 or highly-clustered UNIX solutions. An enterprise-level OS must meet several
    requirements. First, the OS must be reliable--it must not crash, even under extreme loads.
    Second, availability services must be in place to let clients continue to have their
    processing requests satisfied, even when the OS or hardware fails. This functionality
    implies redundancy at the hardware level, with OS or application support to redirect
    client requests from a failed system to one that is functional. Finally, the OS kernel's
    architecture and implementation must support high performance and scalability. In other
    words, the kernel must be sufficiently parallel in its operation to take advantage of
    multiple processors. The kernel must also provide applications with the APIs and
    infrastructure necessary to build high-performance, scalable applications.</p>
    <p>How does Linux measure up to these requirements compared to the current players in the
    enterprise space (i.e., UNIX and NT)? Linux has a reputation as a reliable OS, and plenty
    of Web sites rely on it. However, its high-availability support is still virtually
    non-existent. Its Beowulf clustering, which has been in the trade press recently, is not
    suitable for providing high availability to network server applications. The only other
    measure to use to compare Linux to the rest of the field is performance, including
    multiprocessor scalability. As I previously mentioned, no industry-accepted benchmark
    results exist for Linux running network server applications. Preparing for and executing
    such a benchmark is very costly, both in terms of hardware dollars and technical expertise
    required to execute a benchmark test that will yield competitive numbers. Thus, the lack
    of any Linux benchmark results means one of three things. First, no company with an
    interest in promoting Linux has run benchmarks. Second, it's not in the best interest of
    any company capable of submitting a benchmark with good Linux numbers to do so. Or third,
    companies are trying to get good Linux numbers and are failing.</p>
    <p>It's not clear which companies capable of generating Linux benchmark results have it in
    their best interest to do so. Compaq, HP, Sun Microsystems, and IBM have all made
    pronounced gestures in support of Linux, and so they are all obvious candidates. However,
    they all have proprietary OSs that will compete with Linux as soon as someone demonstrates
    that Linux is ready for the enterprise. In fact, each company has its own version of UNIX.
    So it's not obvious which reason explains the lack of Linux numbers. The best we can do is
    analyze the Linux kernel to determine whether its design and implementation is capable of
    delivering good numbers. Over the past few months, several writers in the technical press
    have thrown out claims regarding the capabilities of the Linux kernel. However, none of
    the authors that I've come across back their claims with any technical facts. As someone
    that specializes in OS internals and network server application design, I decided to
    examine the Linux kernel to determine whether it incorporates several key features
    required to implement high-performance network server applications. I discovered that
    Linux is lacking in several critical areas and that these limitations will hurt Linux's
    performance when compared to various versions of UNIX and NT. I published my findings in
    &quot;Linux and the Enterprise,&quot; Windows NT Magazine, April 1999. (Windows NT
    Magazine has decided to post the electronic form of this article to its Web site at this
    time to help dispel some misplaced Linux hype and to open discourse on this subject. Go to
    </p>
    <p><a HREF="http://www.winntmag.com/Magazine/Article.cfm?ArticleID=5048">http://www.winntmag.com/Magazine/Article.cfm?ArticleID=5048</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>Although my current findings are negative, the intent of revealing them is not. I hope
    to promote Linux as a competitor in the enterprise area, as competition is good for the
    industry and good for consumers. A report by the analyst group D. H. Brown entitled,
    &quot;Linux: How Good Is It?&quot; includes a study of the Linux kernel that comes to the
    same conclusion that I did. In fact, much of this group's conclusion related to Linux SMP
    support is based on my research--my preliminary findings during my study of the Linux
    kernel were posted, without my knowledge or permission, to the Linux kernel USENET
    newsgroup in January by a member of the Linux community. Pages 44 and 45, the heart of the
    SMP analysis, mirror my email almost exactly. The fact is, Linux has a kernel that
    internally looks very much like the prevalent UNIX kernel of the mid-1980s. All commercial
    versions of UNIX and NT have evolved 10 to 15 years past where Linux is as far as SMP
    scalability and network-server application support. And the gains that have been made for
    these other OSs have been difficult to achieve and expensive. Despite a prevalent
    misconception in certain circles to the contrary, NT does classify as an enterprise-class
    OS. NT's performance on network server applications rivals or beats the performance the
    various versions of UNIX can provide. Don't take my word for it, go to <a HREF="http://www.specbench.org/">http://www.specbench.org</a> or <a HREF="http://www.tpc.org/">http://www.tpc.org</a> and see which OSs own the top three
    positions on systems varying in size from uniprocessor to 8-way systems. Across the board,
    NT ranks at the top or near the top when competing against the major UNIX variants,
    including Tru64 UNIX (formerly Digital UNIX), Solaris, and HP/UX. As far as the belief
    widely espoused in advocacy USENET newsgroups and Web sites to the contrary, NT is a
    reliable OS with high-availability options. If it wasn't reliable, no company would use it
    as an enterprise OS, and companies with no particular allegiance to Microsoft wouldn't use
    it at all. The number of companies visibly using NT in an enterprise-serving role are
    plenty: Walt Disney, Dell, Intel, eBay, Barnes and Nobles, United Airlines, Buy.com, and
    Car Point are just a sampling of some of the world's most demanding Internet sites running
    NT. Will Linux gain the capabilities of its cousins and NT? Yes. Can it gain them in the
    next few years based solely on work done by a band of loose-knit developers scattered
    around the world? That remains to be seen. The lessons offered by the evolution of the
    other UNIX variants suggests that Linux requires a sponsor with experience in this area to
    help both financially and technically. Perhaps we'll see the formation of an industry
    consortium that will work together to help evolve Linux. However, it will be at least 2
    years before the Linux kernel can mature to a competitive level.</p>
    <p>As a closing note, I want to provide a warning concerning independent party OS
    benchmarks. Several publications have recently reported benchmark results comparing Linux
    to NT. Some have shown NT to outperform Linux, and some have shown the opposite. My advice
    is to disregard independent tests because they suffer from several flaws. First, by
    definition, an independent tester has no vested interest in the outcome of a benchmark.
    Thus, they also have no interest in understanding the hardware, OS, application, or
    benchmark used in ways required for achieving the best results possible. Only someone with
    a vested interest in good numbers can do the best job possible to achieve those numbers. </p>
    <p>Second, independent tests are almost never performed using industry- accepted
    benchmarks such as SpecWeb or TPC-C/TPC-D. They are typically run using workload programs
    developed in-house or by third parties. Only tests that competing members of an industry
    deem representative of real-world environments can be readily accepted as meaningful.
    Finally, no one audits independent tests. Representatives of each member of the benchmark
    consortium review benchmark results submitted to TPC or SPEC. This review ensures that
    these organizations will publish only numbers obtained in adherence with benchmark
    guidelines, and that means the submitter's competitors have critically viewed the numbers.</p>
