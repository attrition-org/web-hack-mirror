Hey. Thats just to show we're still alive. Yeah, alive as ever. 
We'll be still pissing you admins off
just coz you have no fucking skill, but hey... we're also helping yer lame
ass secur1ng your sh1tz. We could just rm -rf / if we wanted to.<p><br>

'Why?' you may ask. so here is your answer..
<br> We can just fuck up with sites of
big companies just to show that they are 
vulnerable to attacks as anyone else. We can deface government
sites and protest against all the injustice and all their tries to take control
of everyone.
We can 0wn your backbones, we can 0wn your companies, we can
destroy your providers.<br>We do what we want, as much as we can. Sometimes
it requires much research on the target, sometimes it is easy as hell to
gain access. But, who matters?<br> Thats the old same thing:
