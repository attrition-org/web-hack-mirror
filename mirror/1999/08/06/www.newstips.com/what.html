        <p>Novelty, Ohio, is located in the maple sugar hills of
        Geauga County, about 40 minutes east of Cleveland. In the
        basement of one of its houses - unremarkable except
        perhaps for a huge mass of telephone cables that cross to
        it from the street - Marty Winston and his merry band of
        robots conduct one of the most unusual PR operations in
        the computer industry.</p>
        <p>In the basement there are rows of PCs, CD-ROM data
        servers, fax gateways, scanners, modems, laser printers
        and wires coming in and going out in almost every
        direction. These are some of the key members of the
        Newstips, Inc. staff. Over in the corner is the company's
        only human, 20-year industry veteran and PR guy Marty
        Winston. He works with two big Windows machines, which
        are networked to those minions in the back. Across the
        room, an open computer chassis is being fitted for a pair
        of voice channels so Winston can add fax-on-demand to his
        services.</p>
        <p>Winston founded NewsTips in 1993, naming his company
        after the weekly electronic bulletin that he's been
        sending to computer journalists for the past 12 years.
        &quot;The newsletter is the best branded and most
        successful product of my company,&quot; says Winston.
        &quot;It's what people remember.&quot;</p>
        <p>Winston is a colorful character, a technology maven
        with a flair for the fast life that's slowed down a bit
        as he's aged and had children. He started writing
        technical articles for the electronics industry back in
        1968, and his first computer had slide switches, LEDs and
        dry cells.</p>
        <p>He spent the '70s working for ad agencies (most of
        them are now defunct) and was director of publicity for
        Radio Shack during the TRS-80 Model 3 days in 1981 and
        1982. Then he struck out on his own, heading up various
        high-tech PR agencies in Texas where he employed up to 15
        people, before finally settling in Ohio and deciding to
        run a one-man operation.</p>
        <p>With nearly 30 clients now, Winston's presence has
        become a common fixture at every major technology trade
        show there is, where his parties are always well
        attended. Winston is also an assistant sysop on PRSIG,
        the CompuServe PR and Marketing Forum. It's hard to
        travel anywhere on CompuServe without running across his
        on-line opinions. Winston can be outspoken, but it's
        obvious to anyone that he does know his stuff. Even the
        management types at companies like Lotus and Novell take
        his comments very seriously.</p>
        <p>The Newstips bulletin reaches approximately 2,000
        computer industry journalists every week. Winston, who
        prefers to charge his clients a flat fee instead of
        billing by the hour, will sell anything from a one-time
        mention in NewsTips for $350 to virtually unlimited
        consulting services for $15,000 a month. &quot;I never
        liked the idea of charging for time,&quot; he says.
        &quot;That penalizes efficiency and rewards sloth, and is
        always more in an agency's interest than a
        client's.&quot;</p>
        <p>Winston says that because he has relationships with
        some sought-after columnists, it might take him just 30
        seconds to get them to write about his client's product,
        whereas it might take a less experienced PR person as
        long as six months. If you bill the client based on the
        time it takes to get the job done, says Winston,
        &quot;the novice makes $8,000 and I make less than $2.00.
        That's a solid incentive in favor of incompetence.&quot;</p>
        <p>Winston spends a lot of time working in e-mail - he
        estimates he sends and receives at least 2,000 messages a
        day. How does he manage to do it all? &quot;I skim a lot.
        I use rules a lot to eliminate or automate some of it.
        And I work incredibly long hours.&quot;</p>

                                review. All the journalist has to
                                do is indicate an interest, and
                                the system goes into action.
                                Marty queues up the matching
                                information and the system

                                to the journalist. We recently
                                saw him send out about 60 of
                                them. Poof, like magic, the

                                appropriate people. Within
                                minutes, the process was
                                complete; the letters were sent,
                                courtesy copies sent, and
                                documents were filed

        <p>It's tough to be heard above the noise out there in PC
        land. We know because we have to sift through all the
        stuff you and your PR people generate when we're looking
        for real information. We get help from a guy in Novelty,
        OH; his name is Marty Winston and some of you know him.</p>
        <p>Marty is a reporter's
        reporter/engineer/philosopher/curmudgeon/marketing/PR
        guy. He has a different way of getting the information
        out for his select clients. He selects who he will work
        for, and it's limited. A master of the paper-less
        information age, Marty publishes a newsletter for us, and
        in it are succinct newsbites, 'cause Marty knows how busy
        we and others like us are, and he informs us weekly about
        new developments. This isn't an infomercial; we advise
        you regularly about good ideas and good people, and our
        advice this week is to give Marty a call and see if you
        can get him to take on your company. However, be prepared
        to be told what's right and not so right about your
        current approach - this ain't no yes-man you're calling

                        received at Cache la Byte in a little
                        less than two weeks. Now, worthless
                        (recyclable?) scrap paper. </p>
                        <p align="left">Ironically, some of the
                        printouts - replete with fancy logos and
                        catchy headlines - were about products to
                        help &quot;revolutionize&quot; the
                        American office by eliminating
                        paper-shuffling. What's on the horizon,
                        we're told, are document-management
                        systems that will transfer information
                        electronically and store it in
                        computer-based files. </p>
                        <p align="left">There is something
                        oxymoronic in reading about such
                        innovations as network fax-servers and
                        electronic mail systems on laser- printed
                        paper. One has to wonder if the irony is
                        even recognized by the people who draft
                        such epistles, then reproduce them by the
                        dozens (or more). </p>
                        <p align="left">Sure, mailed news
                        releases from public relations firms are
                        the time-hallowed means by which the
                        computer industry communicates directly
                        to the journalists who write about the
                        new products. But few writers work
                        directly from a news release. Generally,
                        such printed information is only the
                        tip-of-the-iceberg of a product review or
                        story - the *real* information usually
                        comes later, testing a product or in
                        interviews with product managers. </p>
                        <p align="left">It's a rare news release
                        that is worth saving more than a couple
                        of weeks. The information becomes
                        outdated too rapidly in such a dynamic
                        industry, and you can build a filing
                        nightmare by trying to decide whether to
                        file something by product category,
                        product name, company name, or
                        what-have-you. So the paper disappears
                        rapidly.</p>
                        <p align="left">Any computer industry
                        journalist not using a fax and/or e-mail

                        accessible by electronic transmissions:
                        Faster, more efficiently, and likely less
                        expensively. I yearn for the time when I
                        can log on to CompuServe (74505,74) and
                        regularly expect to find 2-3 text-based
                        news releases awaiting me. Of the dozens
                        of firms with my name on their
                        distribution list, only Marty Winston's
                        Newstips consistently provides such
                        modern, sensible service.</p>

                        software also gives definitive advantages
                        to receiving news releases via fax. Fax
                        image information can be converted to
                        ASCII, and turned into a
                        computer-searchable file. Information
                        that is worth saving can be,

                        what is going on in an increasingly
                        complex industry. I think it was Stewart
                        Alsop who said that keeping track of the
                        things that are happening and the
                        products that are appearing is a
                        full-time occupation (and that does not
                        include knowing what those products do,
                        or how well they do 'em, as I recall the
                        story). There are many sources one can
                        track. Newstips is always ahead of the
                        curve, and therefore makes the punditry
                        magic look better. Moreover, it is
                        delivered where I need it -- on my

                        include backgrounders -- merely take up
                        precious desk space). And you can quote
