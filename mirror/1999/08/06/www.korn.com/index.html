<p><font face="Terminal">Welcome KoRn fans.&nbsp; Early this morning Jonathan
Davis the lead singer of KoRn was arrested by Federal Agents at his Bakersfield,
California home.&nbsp; His home was raided early this morning by FBI Agents on
suspicion he was involved in the following:</font></p>
<p><font face="Terminal">* Illegal Access Of&nbsp; A Government Computer</font></p>
<p><font face="Terminal">* Credit Card Fraud</font></p>
<p><font face="Terminal">* Telecommunications Fraud</font></p>
<p><font face="Terminal">* Prostitution</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Terminal">The Federal Agents confiscated 11 computers that they
believe to be involved in the crimes.&nbsp; They also confiscated many demo
tracks of KoRn's upcoming album.&nbsp; These will most likely never be given
back.&nbsp; As Jonathan Davis sits in jail we hope he realizes the crimes he is
being accused of are a serious matter.&nbsp; He will be facing 70 years in
prison if he is convicted of these charegs.&nbsp; Lets all hope it does not
happen.</font></p>
