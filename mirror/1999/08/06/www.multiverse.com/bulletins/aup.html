<li> User is responsible for all use of User's account(s) and confidentiality
of password(s).  Multiverse will suspend access to account(s) if Multiverse
believes the security of User's account(s) is compromised.

<li> User is responsible for all local and/or long-distance telephone charges
for connecting to Multiverse.

<li> User is responsible for charges at the time the service is used and
Multiverse may apply the amount due to User's credit card at any time.
If User is paying by cash or check, payment is Net-10.

<li> Multiverse service is provided on an &quot;as is, as available&quot;
basis.  No warranties, Expressed or implied, including, but not
limited to, those of merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose, are made with any respect to Multiverse or any information
or software therein. Neither Multiverse nor its Information Providers
are responsible for any damages arising out of the use, or inability
to use, Multiverse's service.

<li> Multiverse reserves the right to change without notice the Multiverse
service, including, but not limited to, access or dialin procedures,
hours of operation, commands, documentation, vendors and services offered.

<li> Multiverse is not responsible for User's personal files residing on
Multiverse.  User is responsible for independent backup of his or her
data stored on Multiverse.  User may not store old e-mail in the e-mail
spool directory: It is to be archived or deleted after it is read.

<li> Multiverse, at its sole business judgement, may terminate this membership 
Agreement immediately or suspend User's access to the service upon any
breach of this membership Agreement, including, but not limited to,
refusal or failure to pay for services rendered or by sole judgement
of Multiverse that User may be performing activities harmful to
Multiverse or its Users, employees, vendors, equipment, vendors,
business relationships or any other users of the Internet.

<li>Any user who is found out to have had his or her account terminated by another ISP for		any reason, may be subject to account termination at Multiverse without notice.			Multiverse maintains a strict acceptable use policy. Multiverse also reserves the right to		refuse new account activations of individuals or entities who have had other account(s) at		other ISP(s) terminated.


<li> 
The following violations of "netiquette" are grounds for immediate
 	suspension of service pending investigation by Multiverse and will result 	in termination of the account(s) if the investigation determines the user 	has originated or transmitted these types of traffic:



<ol>
     <li> Posting a singles article or substantially similar articles to an
     excessive number of newsgroups (i.e., more than 20) or continued
     posting of articles which are off-topic or which provokes complaints
     from the regular readers of the newsgroup as being off-topic.

     <li> Sending unsolicited mass emailings (i.e. to more than 25 users) which
     provoke complaints from the recipients.

     <li> Engaging in either (a) or (b) from a provider other than Multiverse
     and using an account at Multiverse as a mail drop for responses.

     <li> Continued harassment of other individuals on the Internet after
     being asked to stop by either Multiverse or those individuals.

     <li> Impersonating another user or otherwise falsifying one's user name.

     <li> Use of IRC "bots" on Multiverse, or the compiling of binary programs.
     If you need a program and Multiverse does not have it, ask for it.

</ol>

<li> Non-enforcement of any section of this Agreement does <em>not</em>
constitute consent and Multiverse reserves the right to enforce this
Agreement at its own discretion.

<li> <em>Failure to use account(s) does not relieve user of payment
obligations</em>, except as specifically provided in this contract.

<li> Multiverse may offer from time to time a trial period which User may
cancel membership without incurring any costs.  It is the responsibility
of the User to contact Multiverse to cancel during the trial period and
receive verification that cancellation has occured.  Failure to use the
account(s) does not constitute cancellation, and User will be billed at
normal or promoted service rates.

<li>Unmetered access shall be construed as a maximum of 300 online hours in
any 30 day period, usable in increments of no more than 10 hours per day.  
Online hours in excess will be billed at a rate commensurate with Multiverse's current		dedicated 56KFlex price point, and will incur all setup and equipment charges related to		the installation and maintenance of a dedicated 56KFlex circuit.




<li> Shell accounts are offered Multiverse clients as a free, value-added
service for non-commercial, personal home pages only.
