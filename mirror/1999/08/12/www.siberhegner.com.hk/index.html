        Brags Military Would Roll Up Taiwan In Days</font><!--
 TextStart --><!-- MediaEnd --></h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial">By Benjamin Kang Lim </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">BEIJING (Reuters) - China,
        embroiled in a war of words with Taiwan, boasted
        Wednesday that if a real war broke out between the two
        rivals, the island could not resist for more than five
        days. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">``How many days can the 400,000-man
        'Nationalist army' resist?'' screamed the front-page
        headline in the China Business Times News Weekly. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">``Once war breaks out, resistance
        would be four to five days at the most,'' said the
        newspaper, which splashed pictures of jet fighters,
        missiles and alongside the story. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Relations between Beijing and
        Taipei soured last month when Taiwan President Lee
        Teng-hui unilaterally redefined them as ''special
        state-to-state.'' </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Lee junked the longstanding ``one
        China'' policy, which has helped underpin East Asian
        security for decades, in a bid to break Taipei out of
        diplomatic isolation imposed by Beijing. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Beijing, which regards Taiwan as a
        breakaway province and has threatened to invade if the
        island declared independence, has said Lee's move was a
        ``dangerous step'' down the separatist road. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The newspaper said speculation that
        China would not go to war because it is in the midst of
        economic development was ''completely wrong.'' </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">It said China has not moved against
        Taiwan in part because it did not want to see Lee declare
        martial law and put off presidential elections due in
        March 2000. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Western defense analysts say the
        2.5 million-strong People's Liberation Army (PLA) may be
        the biggest fighting machine in the world, but it is
        mainly a junkyard of obsolete weapons, undertrained
        troops and an officer corps distracted by business until
        a ban was imposed last year. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The analysts said China has few
        real military options to prevent Taiwan's thoughts of
        independence other than the impossible -- a seaborne
        invasion -- and the unthinkable -- nuclear war. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">But the China Defense News said
        Beijing's resolve to stop Taiwan from bolting even in the
        event of foreign intervention should not be
        underestimated. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The PLA ``is a modern crack force
        of steel,'' it said. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The military newspaper cast doubt
        over whether Uncle Sam would risk burning himself by
        ``pulling chestnuts out of a fire'' and back Taiwan. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The United States has told China
        that any effort to determine the future of Taiwan other
        than by peaceful means would be of ``grave concern'' to
        Washington. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">When China conducted intimidatory
        war games in waters near Taiwan in the run-up to the
        island's first direct presidential elections in March
        1996, the United States sent two aircraft carrier
        battlegroups to the area. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">``The Chinese people do not hope
        for war but are not afraid of war,'' the newspaper said,
        quoting late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">It reminded Taiwan that the
        Communists routed the 800,000-strong Nationalist army in
        a civil war on the mainland in 1949. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">It said no Taiwan politician was
        ``willing to be nailed to the historical pillar of shame
        along with Lee Teng-hui.'' </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The official Xinhua news agency
        quoted military analyst Peng Guangqian as saying Lee was
        a ``deformed test tube baby cultivated from the political
        laboratory of international anti-China forces.'' </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Peng said Lee was ``courting
        destruction.'' </font></p>
