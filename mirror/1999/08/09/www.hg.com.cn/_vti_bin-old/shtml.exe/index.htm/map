        sites. Your propaganda is played out. (We wonder if any Chinese sites will be targeted in 
        retaliation anytime soon?) NYS, for whatever our opinion is worth, supports President Lee 
        Teng-hui. Taipei is waiting. (Patiently?) Beijing can be mad all they want to. Why 
        threaten to use force against Taiwan in order to keep them under some oppressive thumb of 
        mainland rule? <br>

      <li><big><font face="Courier New">China won't even let the Pope into the country due to his 
        diplomatic ties to Taiwan. <strong><font color="#ffffff">[Hong Kong Bishop Joseph Zen told 
        Reuters Monday that China &quot;says the Vatican has ties with Taiwan and no ties with us. 
        Therefore, such a visit is not convenient.&quot;]</font></strong></font> <font face="Courier New">Theology aside, (we are not Catholics), this is just plain stupid and 
        moronic at best. &quot;Not convenient&quot;? Give us a break. If world politics are 
        reduced to such childish antics how can anything positive ever be accomplished? Then 
        again, what else should anyone expect from politicians?</big><br>

<p><font face="Courier New">* Again, this site was entered and altered easily enough with 
Micro$oft Front Page. For the elite out there, it is our hope that you understand that we 
are attempting something noble and admit fully these recent defacements to be primer level 
at best.&nbsp; We are not trying to steal anyone's thunder. We are not trying to be 
something we are not. We sit with fingers crossed eternally that some form of organization 
would develop and all groups and crews and individuals would band together to defeat a 
greater evil. Together we can be unstoppable. Together we can be uncatchable. Together we 
can demand an audience. Say the word and we will be the first ones to come out fighting.
