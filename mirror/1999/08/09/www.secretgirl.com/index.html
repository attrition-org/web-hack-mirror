Clowns have made me nervous for years, and I would have to chalk it up to a combination of costumed weirdoes at Disneyland and exposure to The Joker, Clown Prince of Crime. He killed people left and right, usually with fun happy toy-based weapons. Of Course seeing evil or murderous clowns in books and movies did not help me at all, but the final blow was when I heard of the actions of John Wayne Gacy and now the kl0wn kr3w.<br>
