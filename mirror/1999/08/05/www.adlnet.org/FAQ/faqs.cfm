		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="345BF8"><b>A:</b></font> <font face="Arial">People and organizations care about the ADL initiative because:<ul><li>The American people want better education and better training. </li>
<li>Corporations want higher performance. </li>
<li>The Department of Defense (DoD) wants the same things.</li>
<li>The Nation (public sector and private industry) will be better served with a better    learning environment.</li>
<li>ADL provides an open and collaborative way of making it happen. It benefits all within the DoD and outside DoD (students, instructors, corporations, and administrators).</li>
<li>ADL will stimulate and take full advantage of progress being made in knowledge management systems and technologies that enhance learning and performance -- anywhere, anytime.</li></ul></font>

		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="408080"><b>Q:</b></font><b><font face="Arial">Why did the President's Executive Memorandum cite ADL as a model for the
application of distributed learning technologies?</font></b><br>
		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="345BF8"><b>A:</b></font> <font face="Arial">ADL is considered a model because it has all the key elements of a strategic
plan to create a new environment for learning. <br><br>

When we started the ADL initiative, we were trying to find a DoD solution to a DoD
problem. As we thought about it and talked to our counterparts in other government
agencies and in the private sector, we recognized that the key elements of the ADL
initiative were common to all our interests. ADL has created an open forum for developing
common solutions to reach education and training goals shared by the public and private
sectors.</font>

Conference in November?</font></b><br>
		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="345BF8"><b>A:</b></font> <font face="Arial">The Administration recognized that the ADL initiative provides an open process and a plan that will help achieve and support national goals for education and workforce training and development. The Executive Office of the President wanted to promote the opportunity for expanded participation in ADL and to support actions that would:
<ul>
<li>Invite the presentation of broader perspectives and needs in an open forum.</li>
<li>Create opportunities for partnerships between government and private-sector interests.</li>
<li>Stimulate business and accelerate product development.</li>
<li>Highlight needs for better knowledge management systems and collaboration tools for individuals and organizations.</li>

		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="345BF8"><b>A:</b></font> <font face="Arial">When we explain ADL, we generally break it down into four primary areas: 
<ul>
<li>Vision -- What we think the learning and job environments will look like in the future;</li>
<li>Products -- The learning content and tools for instructors, learners, and managers with an ADL focus on those products available now, those emerging in the near term, and those to be developed in the future that will define a distributed learning environment;</li>
<li>Technical Process -- The enablers that make advanced distributed learning possible; and</li>
<li>Collaborative Forum -- The partnerships and interaction that focus everyone's attention and resources (financial and intellectual) on a common set of goals.</li>

		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="408080"><b>Q:</b></font><b><font face="Arial">What is the ADL "vision"?</font></b><br>
		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="345BF8"><b>A:</b></font> <font face="Arial">Actually, we think it is a common vision, shared by the public and private sectors. We want to ensure that our people have: 
<ul>
<li>Access to the highest-quality education and training, </li>
<li>Tailored to their needs, </li>
<li>Whenever and wherever they need it. </li>
</ul>

A few months ago, <i>Information Week</i> quoted the global director at Dow Chemical as saying
essentially the same thing. He said knowledge management is "Getting the right knowledge, to the right people, at the right time, so they can make the best decision."</font>

		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="345BF8"><b>A:</b></font> <font face="Arial">Fully developed instructional content that is highly effective, reusable, and easy to modify is perhaps the most important product.  In addition to course content, products include: 
<ul>
<li>Better tools for instructors, </li>
<li>Learning management tools, </li>
<li>Content development tools, and</li>
<li>Aids and mentor systems (for learners and workers) that can enhance performance. </li>

		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="345BF8"><b>A:</b></font> <font face="Arial">The key to technical success in ADL will be the collaborative development of a common framework that includes standards and guidelines that anyone can follow. 
<br><br>
The framework will focus on giving us the capability to produce: 
<ul>
  <li>Interactive "learning objects" and management and performance tools that are</li>
  <li>Platform-independent and can be </li>
  <li>Interactive with a network or embedded in any learning environment or performance aid. </li></ul></font>

		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="408080"><b>Q:</b></font><b><font face="Arial">What is the ADL collaborative forum?  How does the partnership between the public and private sectors work?</font></b><br>
		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="345BF8"><b>A:</b></font> <font face="Arial">The absolutely critical thing to remember is that everyone -- whether from government, academia, or industry -- is participating in their own self-interest. <br><br>
ADL provides an open process, where participants can share intellectual capital and identify common interests and opportunities.<br><br>
ADL provides the forum for sharing our common goals, and for developing ways to reach those goals. The intent is to have ADL partners apply resources to their own needs, but to do so in ways that are not redundant or in ways that others can use to satisfy their needs as well. That is why we have had so much interest in participating (from Federal agencies, universities, manufacturers, and major software developers). A key to the partnership will be to identify common interests and to establish specific working relationships.</font>

		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="408080"><b>Q:</b></font><b><font face="Arial">What about standards? Are you working with the major standards organizations?</font></b><br>
		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="345BF8"><b>A:</b></font> <font face="Arial">Yes, we are working with the standards groups internal and external to the DoD.  We are working closely with Educom IMS (Instructional Management System), a consortium of over 600 public- and private-sector organizations, to develop common guidelines and standards for ADL. We are supporting the other Federal agencies (like NIST) and other standards groups, such as the IEEE and AICC (Aviation Industry CBT Committee). 
<ul>
<li>We are defining the needs for standards. </li>
<li>Our strategy is to let industry set the standards wherever possible.</li>
<li>Standards are the basis for wider use of commercial learning products and tools.</li>
<li>The standards will evolve over time. </li>

		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="408080"><b>Q:</b></font><b><font face="Arial">How much is ADL going to cost, and who is going to pay for it?</font></b><br>
		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="345BF8"><b>A:</b></font> <font face="Arial">Everyone is paying for education and training now. ADL would raise the quality and effectiveness of education and training. Costs of development and delivery would go down, as more products become available in the market place. This is a major thrust of the initiative. <br><br>

Importantly, ADL partners will be applying their own resources to their own needs.  Working together, however, we would expect to solve problems at lower costs than if we had tried to solve those problems alone. This is especially true for content development. We are also discussing course development, administration, and tools for instructors, learners, and workers.</font>

		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="408080"><b>Q:</b></font><b><font face="Arial">What are the savings? Who will benefit from those?</font></b><br>
		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="345BF8"><b>A:</b></font> <font face="Arial">Savings will come from higher performance and less time away from the job. We will not have to spend as much money on sending people to get education and training, if we can bring the education and training to them prior to and after any required resident instruction.
<br><br>
We can't afford not to do this. Everyone will benefit. That is why ADL is a partnership. <br><br>

Those who are part of the ADL initiative will have more influence in shaping the future
learning environment, but everyone will be better off. <br><br>

Savings will come from having learning-related software that is platform independent,
reusable, and easy to modify, and that can interact with a network.  Every time content
changes in the future learning environment, we will not have to go through the expensive
process of re-creating all the courseware and other learning-related programs.</font>

		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="408080"><b>Q:</b></font><b><font face="Arial">Why is the Department of Defense putting so much effort into the development and application of advanced learning technology?</font></b><br>
		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="345BF8"><b>A:</b></font> <font face="Arial">There are a number of reasons:
<ul>
<li>Our vision is to provide education and training, tailored to needs, whenever and   wherever it is needed. </li>
<li>In tomorrow's uncertain national security environment, we may have to send people to a crisis on a moment's notice. We will also have to train them "just in time."  ADL will let us do that, and do it well.</li>
<li>The bulk of our training costs are people-related. We would like to reduce the amount of time and money that it takes to train our people. We would like to improve performance by providing just-in-time training at the job site. And we would like to take advantage of the technologies and capabilities that can be provided by others in the public and private sectors to increase the quality and quantity of effective learning products.</li>

		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="345BF8"><b>A:</b></font> <font face="Arial">We believe that all aspects of ADL are critical to its eventual success. 
<ul>
<li>We definitely must have reusable learning content that can be delivered over a network. </li>
<li>We must have the technical standards and guidelines that make this possible.</li>
<li>We must do research and development on technical issues that stand in the way.</li>
<li>We must ensure that such learning is cost-effective and that it can be developed and    marketed in a way that allows industry to make a profit.</li>
<li>Recognizing this, we (the DoD), provide the ADL forum that allows the public and private    sectors to identify and address their common interests in developing and transitioning to the Advanced Distributed Learning environment of tomorrow. </li>

		<font face="Arial" size="+2" color="345BF8"><b>A:</b></font> <font face="Arial">ADL has a focus on what is available now, the products emerging within the year, and steps that need to be undertaken now to accelerate the development of future products for learning and performance enhancement. <br><br>

We are making great progress today and we see the Internet augmenting learning now (pre- and post-resident instruction).  We are developing and using better tools today.
<br><br>
Future technology capabilities will: 
<ul>
<li>Increase access to knowledge;</li>
<li>Create a larger market for ADL products;</li>
<li>Improve quality and effectiveness;</li>
<li>Allow life-long learning; and, </li>
