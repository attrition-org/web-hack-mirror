        face="Arial"><strong>Overview</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Background:</strong>
        In November 1997, the Department of Defense and the White
        House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)
        launched the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL)
        initiative.   A major collaborative ADL partner and presentor at the Kick-Off Meeting is
		the <a href="http://www.imsproject.org">Instructional Management Systems (IMS)</a>
		Project sponsored by EDUCAUSE.
		This project is developing an open architecture for online learning.  While
		other ADL activities are focused on instructional content development and
		delivery using current and emerging technologies, the IMS project focuses
		on next-generation open architecture for online learning. Other presentors
		at the Kick-Off Meeting included government and industry representatives of
		Apple, General Motors, Microsoft, and Teknowledge.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Purpose:
        </strong>The purpose of the ADL initiative is to ensure
        access to high-quality education and training materials
        that can be tailored to individual learner needs and can
        be made available whenever and wherever they are
        required. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This
        initiative is designed to accelerate large-scale
        development of dynamic and cost-effective learning
        software and to stimulate an efficient market for these
        products in order to meet the education and training
        needs of the military and the nation's workforce in the
        21<sup>st</sup> century. It will do this through the
        development of a common technical framework for computer
        and net-based learning that will foster the creation of
        re-usable learning content as &quot;instructional
        objects.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Common
        Guidelines: </strong>The Defense Department is taking
        steps to establish a cost-effective distributed learning
        environment that is consistent across the military
        Services and all other DoD components. Many university
        and business training organizations have similar
        interests. DoD and other federal agencies want to make
        use of specifications representing best commercial
        practice. In order to facilitate the development of
        specifications that meet the interests of all
        participants, ADL will ensure that a common set of
        guidelines for this new object-oriented learning
        environment is developed through active collaboration
        with the private sector, where many of the innovations in
        network technology and software design are taking place. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Collaborative
        Effort:</strong> ADL partnerships between the federal
        government, private-sector technology suppliers, and the
        broader education and training community will be the
        means for formulating voluntary guidelines that will meet
        common needs. By making learning software accessible,
        interoperable, durable, and reusable, the ADL initiative
        will ensure that academic, business, and government users
        of learning software gain the best possible value from
        the materials they purchase. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Outcome
        Metrics: </strong>Success of the ADL initiative will be
        measured by the extent to which: (a) consumers are able
        to purchase high-quality learning software less
        expensively than they do today; (b) the size of the
        learning software market increases; and (c) producers of
        learning software are able to achieve a higher return on
        their investments. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Computer-based
        training materials are largely developed on a
        proprietary, company-by-company basis, resulting in high
        development costs and limited re-sale value. American
        companies alone spend billions of dollars a year on the
        development of training products, with little of the
        investment focused on re-sale or external product
        development. By developing guidelines, the ADL initiative
        seeks to create new markets for training materials,
        reduce the cost of development, and increase the
        potential return on investment. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Object
        Technology: </b>A review of software industry trends
        indicates that many companies now believe that an
        object-based approach will provide the basis for platform
        neutrality and software reusability needed for the
        large-scale development and dissemination of powerful and
        cost-effective learning content. Platform neutrality and
        software reusability are considered essential for the
        sustained investments necessary to create the kind of
        dynamic ADL environment that is needed to meet the
        education and training needs of a 21<sup>st</sup> century
        military and national workforce. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Platform
        Neutrality: </b>There is an emerging consensus that
        specifications for new platform-neutral techniques are
        sufficiently mature to justify investment in
        next-generation applications. While it is understood that
        more innovation is needed in the education and training
        domain, it appears that the development of a robust
        object-based and platform-neutral environment for
        distributed learning will become practical and feasible
        over the next 2-5 years. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Forum: </b>The
        ADL initiative will provide a forum for exercising and
        assessing a variety of technical approaches for producing
        instructional objects that meet the needs of the ADL
        partners. Results will then form the basis for an initial
        set of ADL guidelines. </font></p>
