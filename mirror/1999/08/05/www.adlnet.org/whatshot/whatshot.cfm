		<P><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif, Arial">On June 14, IBM Chairman and CEO Lou Gerstner spoke before the Joint Economic Committee's first National Summit on High Technology. 

Gerstner spoke about the benifits of distributed learning "About one-third of all our internal training will be done this year via distributed learning, with savings and productivity gains of $100 million".<P> 
 
He went on to add "The benefits transcend the commercial world. Governments are finding that the Net is a tangible way to demonstrate efficient use of taxpayer dollars. Arizona enables citizens to renew their driver's licenses over the Net. The convenience alone probably justifies the investment. But the state has also learned that processing an online renewal costs 75 percent less than an over-the-counter transaction."<P>

To agree on a collaborative Technical Action Plan<br>

		<P><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif, Arial"><font color="#23238e">The Department of Defense announces the launch of its Strategic Plan for Advanced Distributed Learning.<p>

Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness, Thomas K. Longstreth, transmitted the Department of Defense Strategic Plan for Advanced
Distributed Learning to the 106th Congress on April 30th, 1999.<p>  

The report provides the Department's strategy to achieve Secretary Cohen's vision that the Department of Defense provide its Total Force access to the highest quality education and training that can be tailored to individual
needs, and delivered cost effectively, anywhere and anytime it is required.<p>

Creation of the Plan was a true demonstration of the spirit of collaboration which is at the heart of the Advanced Distributed Learning initiative. It is a dynamic template, which uses the leadership of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to guide DoD's learning-related business processes as they evolve from today's models to those required for the future.<p></font>

<b>THE WHITE HOUSE<br>
January 12, 1999<br>
EXECUTIVE ORDER<br>
USING TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES<p></b>

Advances in technology and increased skills needs are changing the workplace at an ever increasing rate. These advances can make Federal employees more productive and provide improved service to our customers, the American taxpayers. We need to ensure that we continue to train Federal employees to take full advantage of these technological advances and to acquire the skills and learning needed to succeed in a changing workplace. A coordinated Federal effort is needed to provide flexible training opportunities to employees and to explore how Federal training programs, initiatives, and policies can better support lifelong learning through the use of learning technology.

To help us meet these goals, I am creating a task force on Federal training technology, directing Federal agencies to take certain steps to enhance employees' training opportunities through the use of training technology, and an advisory committee on the use of training technology, which also will explore options for financing the training and post-secondary education needed to upgrade skills and gain new knowledge.</font>
