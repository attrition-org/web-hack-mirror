What is a dog on a chain?  The animal is contained within confines specified by the Master.  It eats and sleeps when the Master chooses, and any behavior not chosen by the Master constitues punishment. <br> Did the dog choose the size of the yard or the length of the chain? Did the dog decide what the Master  should feed him or when? Of course not. <br> After all, what is a dog on a chain?  It's the American People, and our chain is growing ever shorter.<br><br>
<center>. o 0 FREE.  UNRESTRAINED.  WITHOUT COST.  WITHOUT LIMIT.  PRICELESS 0 o .</center><br><br>
What do we pay for "freedom"?  We pay for freedom with our privacy.  We pay with our options and our choices.  We pay with our <b> lives</b>.<br>Last I checked, "free" meant one didn't have to pay for it.<br><br>
<center>. o 0 OUR WANING FREEDOM 0 o .</center><br><br>
The rights, choices, and privacy of the American public are being removed at an astonishing and horrifying rate.  As we move into the new millenium, science fiction becomes reality, technology grws ever more omnipresent, and the blocked fear and ignorance of "Big Brother" is slowly creeping into realization.<br>
I was informed early this morning that a law has been passed in California allowing Officers of the "Peace" to raid one's home in search of "illegal" property without the previous approval of a court (search warrant).  This law WILL progress to other states (if it hasn't already), and similar laws will likely follow, including limitations on "due process".  Didn't anyone take U.S. History in school?  Doesn't anyone realize that it was <b>exactly</b> this type of unjust prosecution that led us to form a union of free states to begin with?<br>We might as well hand our hard-earned "free" country back over to British control.  What's happening here? <br><br>

<b>Q:</b> Who is to blame for the silencing of our opinions?  Who should be labeled the retriever of choice?  Who has made a mockery of our long-sought <B>FREEDOM</B>?<br>
The government?  The Media?  The Wealthy? The Poor? Our parents, teachers, schools? Corporate America?<br>
<b>A:</b> All of them together, but none individually.  This is the principle our nation was founded upon.  <B>WE ARE TO BLAME</B>. I am to blame.  You are to blame.  The voters <i>and</i> non-voters are to blame.<br><br>
<center>. o 0 WE HAVE CREATED A MONSTER 0 o .</center><br><br>
In the beginning, the people made the government.  As the tables turn, and downfall grows closer, the government is making the people.  Ill-planned voting and negligence have brought about a government too strong for itself.  An overbearing government <i>ALWAYS</I> brings rebellion by the people.  But what good is rebellion when the people will simply create another overbearing government? <B>CONSIDER YOUR OPTIONS</B>.<br><br>
This is <b>our</b> country, and we must fight to keep it from being conquered by the monster of our creation.<br><br>
Unless you <b><i>want</i></b> to live like a dog on a chain, VOTE.<br><br>
At least save yourself.
