{In a mechanical voice} Cowboy. Cowboy. 

<p>Well I'm packing up my game and I'm a head out west<br>
Where real women come equipped with scripts and fake breasts<br>
Find a nest in the hills chill like Flynt<br>
Buy an old droptop find a spot to pimp<br>
And I'm a Kid Rock it up and down your block<br>
With a bottle of scotch and watch lots of crotch<br>
Buy yacht with a flag sayin' chillin' the most<br>
Then rock that bitch up and down the coast<br>
Give a toast to the sun, drink with the stars<br>
Get thrown in the mix and tossed out of bars<br>
Sip the Tijuana...I wanna roam<br>
Find the motown chillin' fools then come back home<br>
Start an escort service, for all the right reasons<br>
And set up shop at the top of four seasons<br>
Kid Rock and I'm the real mccoy<br>
<br>
And I'm headin' out west sucker...because I wanna be a<br>
Cowboy baby<br>
With the top let back and the sunshine shining<br>
Cowboy baby<br>
West coast chillin&#146; with the Boone's Wine<br>
I wanna be a Cowboy baby<br>
Ridin' at night 'cause I sleep all day<br>
Cowboy baby<br>
I can smell a pig from a mile away<br>
<br>
I bet you'll hear my whistle blowin' when my train rolls in<br>
It goes (whistle) like dust in the wind<br>
Stoned pimp, <font color="#FF0000">stoned brew</font>, stoned out of my mind<br>
I once was lost, but now I'm just blind<br>
Palm trees and weeds, scabbed knees and rice<br>
Get a map to the stars, find Heidi Fliece (sp?)<br>
And if the price is right I'm gonna make my bid boy<br>
<br>
And let Cali-for-ny-aye know why they call me<br>
Cowboy baby<br>
With the top let back and the sunshine shining<br>
Cowboy baby<br>
West coast chillin&#146; with the Boone's Wine<br>
I wanna be a Cowboy baby<br>
Ridin' at night 'cause I sleep all day<br>
Cowboy baby<br>
I can smell a pig from a mile away<br>
<br>
Yeah...Kid Rock...you can call me Tex<br>
Rollin' sunset woman with a bottle of Becks<br>
Seen a slimmy in a 'vette, rolled down my glass<br>
And said, &quot;Yeah this dick fits right in your ass&quot;<br>
No kiddin', gun slingin', spurs hittin' the floor<br>
Call me Hoss, I'm the Boss, with the sauce in the horse<br>
No remorse for the sherrif, in his eye I ain't right<br>
I'm gonna paint his town red, then paint his wife white HUH<br>
Cause chaos, rock like Amadeus<br>
Find West Coast pussy for my Detroit players<br>
Mack like mayors, ball like Lakers<br>
They told us to leave, but bet they can't make us<br>
Why they wanna pick on me...lock me up and snort away my key<br>
I ain't no G, I'm just a regular failure<br>
I ain't straight outta compton...I'm straight out the trailer<br>
Cuss like a sailor...drink like a <font color="#FF0000">mick</font><br>
My only words of wisdom are just (radio edit)<br>
I'm flickin' my Bic up and down that coast and<br>
Keep on truckin' until it falls into motion<br>
<br>
Cowboy<br>
With the top let back and the sunshine shining<br>
Cowboy<br>
Spendin' all my time at Hollywood and Vine<br>
Cowboy<br>
Ridin' at night 'cause I sleep all day<br>
Cowboy<br>
I can smell a pig from a mile away<br>
Cowboy<br>
With the top let back and the sunshine shining<br>
Cowboy<br>
With the top let back and the sunshine shining<br>
Cowboy<br>
Hollywood and Vine<br>
<br>
