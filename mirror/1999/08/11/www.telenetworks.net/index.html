We all can explain it, but it still looks like a mystery.<br>
This page was hacked.<br>
Some can explain it, but it still looks like a mystery.<br>
<br>
Why was it hacked ?<br>
Why wasn't there any good security ?<br>
Why are some administrators pissed if they are hacked ?<br>
<br>
If people see an eclipse they remember where they are:<br>
on just one small planet in a big universe.<br>
For a while they feel how small they are, 'cause they can't
control the universe.<br>
<br>
If people see a hack they also should remember where they are:<br>
In a digital world, where personal data is stored on servers, <br>
connected by phonelines and cables.<br>
For a while they feel how small they are, because they can't
control cyberspace.<br>
<br>
No, we will never be able to control the universe,<br>
But we can control cyberspace.<br>
The universe was created by the nature, <br>
and the nature still controls the cyberspace<br>
The Internet was created by hackers,<br>
and hackers still control the Internet.<br>
<br>
All 'good' governments want to improve the earth.<br>
All 'good' hackers want to improve the Internet.<br>
Why are hacker hunted down by governments while they want the
same thing, in a different place ?<br>
Because they don't know cyberspace.<br>
They don't understand it, and they see the people who control it
as intruders in their own world.<br>
<br>
They don't want to see that cyberspace was created to make life
easier for us all, and that it belongs to us all.<br>
They let people try to 'own' a part of cyberspace, <br>
while they are not capable enough to do it.<br>
All what hackers want to do is to help them improving their
knowledge,<br>
By showing them what they did wrong.<br>
They are the intruders in cyberspace, but do hackers hunt them
down ?<br>
No, hackers are helping them to do what they want to do.<br>
They are helping by hacking their systems, their part of the
Internet.<br>
<br>
A hack is an eclipse in cyberspace.<br>
Respect goes out to all the hackers who are fighting for this.<br>
Let's go on, let's keep on fighting.<br>
Let's create eclipses till all the people know where they are.<br>
Let's go on till cyberspace is the moest secure place in the
world.<br>
<br>
Today we live on earth, today we live in cyberspace.<br>
