<p align="center"><font color="#FF8040" size="3">Just gotta clear
up a few things posted on a defacement by codeman earlier. First,
neeper is not our founder he is just a member of the team like
everyone else, we really have no founder, we were just started by
a group of people with the same interest in computers, and most
were in a former group together. Second, we really have no
specific &quot;Jobs&quot; within the group, yes some of us
program, some hack, some do art, some may do all, but everyone is
not really classified under a specific category. And Third, he
forgot to list some members on his defacement, since you already
have seen some of the names, we might as well at this time give
you the full current list of members (see below) -Uneek

community are up to the challange.</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040"><em><b>Software company challengers
hackers</b></em><em><br>
Crackers will be challenged to break into a new software product
designed to block attempts to change the content of Web sites. </em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040"><em>The software, called SecurePage,
comes from Australian company Creative Digital Technology. Its
chief operating officer, Philip Burton, is so confident it can
secure web sites that he told the Australian newspaper: &quot;We
are prepared to stand behind that financially by offering a prize
to universities to see if they can do what our developers haven't
been able to do.&quot; </em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040"><em>The company says none of their
software developers have yet been able to alter sites that used
the system. </em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040"><em><b>Net graffiti</b></em><em> </em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040"><em>Crackers attacking Web pages replace
them with their own, often embarrassing, content. Recent high
profile victims are the CIA, Net security company Symantec and
the US military. </em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040"><em>SecurePage works by encrypting a
copy of every page on a site, reports New Scientist. This master
version is continually compared with the pages available on the
Internet. If any of the content changes without authorisation,
the software kicks in and restores the original using the master
as the source. </em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040"><em>Because the master is encrypted
using a triple-strength version of the US government's 192-bit
DES algorithm, breaking the code would require an enormous amount
of time and computer power. </em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040"><em><b>Crack in defences?</b></em><em> </em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040"><em>Bruce Schneier of Counterpane
Systems, a computer security consultancy in Minneapolis, says
SecurePage sounds like a good idea, but he already sees a chink
in SecurePage's armour. </em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040"><em>&quot;Crackers would try to break
the page-checking mechanism,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't know
how hard it is to do, but if they can change an equals sign to a
'does not equal' sign, they could break the system.&quot; </em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040"><em>However, CDT chief executive Bahram
Boutorabi insisted: &quot;We can protect any Web site.&quot; </em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040"><em>He added: &quot;The first version of
the product runs on Microsoft's Internet Information Server
platform, but we are planning to roll out across all
platforms.&quot; </em></font></p>
