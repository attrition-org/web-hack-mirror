<font size="1">I got bored and hacked this site. I guess i have no message or motivation. I guess this is what you would call 'recreational hacking'. Well, free kevin and all those other d00des that got raided and shit. Burn AntiOnline, JP is an ass. and Drink Milk. <p>
This is the part where all those l337 hackers greet people, but i guess I have no one to greet except EvilMatter and G1bs0n.
