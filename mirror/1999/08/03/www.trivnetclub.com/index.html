<p><big><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">Friends, hackers, defacers</font></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the last web site I shall be hacking. I
realize now that web defacements are totally pointless and silly. </font></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">v00d00, you are right. I really am a pointless
idiot doing stupid hacks.</font></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">I shall never ever deface another site in my life.
I am turning over a new leaf. I am going into the security consultant field. Like
&nbsp; amybe I could help sysadmins make their sites more secure and hack-proof to the
best of my abilities. That way I shall be making amends for my past sins.</font></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">I publicly apologize to all the sysadmins who were
hurt mentally and spiritually by my thoughtless behaviour.</font></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye forever.</font></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish to thank all those people who stood by me
while I was being branded as the biggest fool cause of my ravings about monisha.</font></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">People like Xessor, Punkis. Jericho, Devil-C, Doc
Nuker and anyone I might have missed were absolutely great to me and I really really am
indebted to you guys.</font></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sysadmin:- There was only an &quot;under
construction&quot;&nbsp; html and I haven't backed it up. I am sorry.</font></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">Finally a BIG APOLOGY to the staff at BIZNET. And
I really mean it.</font></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">The end has come. The AntiChrist hacks no
more...........</font></big></big></p>
