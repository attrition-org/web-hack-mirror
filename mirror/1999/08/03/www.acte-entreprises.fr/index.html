      <li><font face="Courier New">August 9, 1999 is just around the corner. This is when Kevin
        Mitnick is due to be sentenced to an expected 46 months on top of the 22 months he already
        recieved. Is that fair? Is that justice? After that date we will see what you all are
        standing on. <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Courier New">And the script from the upcoming Miramax&#153; movie
        &quot;Takedown&quot; has been &quot;prematurely secured and made publicly available&quot;
        and is filled with so many glorious lies and gross exxagerations that it makes us reel.
        More falsehoods on top of obvious mud? Is this to make the &quot;hacker&quot; community
        seem like &quot;some evil entity&quot;? We believe so.</font> </li>

      <dd><font face="Courier New">And v00d00 is right. Why all of these senseless defacements?
        The attention is a bullshit motive and if that is your main incentive for defacing then
        you should be ashamed of yourself. (However trite or motherly it may sound.)When we see
        sites, especially heavy traffic or high profile sites, that have been defaced and have no
        valid message aside from the ever-mundane &quot;You have been hacked&quot;, etc. it makes
        us want to throw in the towel. And so we are. <br>
        Right now we have root on a little better than 30 servers and will still continue to dig
        for more. If anyone wants easy access just say so. But until we can come up with a better
        game plan we are dropping out. The worst part about it might just be that there are no
        real issues that need to be addressed anyway. Society is apathetic and numb and we should
        all be a lot better off if we turned off these computers and went and sat on the damned
        couch and ate Frito's&#153; shaped like cartoon characters and sipped on whatever cola had
        the coolest advertisements and watched any show on the Fox&#153; network (Simpson's
        aside.)and never had an original thought ever.<br>
        Let us know if we can be of <a href="mailto:notoriousyoungslammers@mindless.com">service</a>.
        We are not afraid.</font> </dd>

<p><font face="Courier New">* Again, this site was entered and altered easily enough with
Micro$oft Front Page. For the elite out there, it is our hope that you understand that we
are attempting something noble and admit fully these recent defacements to be primer level
at best.&nbsp; We are not trying to steal anyone's thunder. We are not trying to be
something we are not. We sit with fingers crossed eternally that some form of organization
would develop and all groups and crews and individuals would band together to defeat a
greater evil. Together we can be unstoppable. Together we can be uncatchable. Together we
can demand an audience. Say the word and we will be the first ones to come out fighting.
