 Clever; smart; best 

at something. That's a rough translation of the Hawaiian word 

"akamai" and why planners chose the word as the title for a major 

telemedicine project in the Pacific theater.
<p>
	Akamai is one of a roughly half-dozen telemedicine projects 

Tripler and other components of the U.S. Pacific Command are 

testing for the assistant secretary of defense for health 

affairs. Air Force Lt. Col. Tony Gelish, project director, said 

the primary goal of Akamai is "customer service, whether they are 

health care providers or the patients" in areas of the theater 

where health care is limited.
<p>

	"Tripler is reaching out and asking the question, 'How can 

we improve our customer support?'" Gelish said. "'Telepresence 

is a great way, because it's less expensive than moving patients 

or assigning additional [health care] providers."
<p>
	Three objectives guide the project:
<ul>
<li>Conduct telemedicine and digital imaging throughout the 

Pacific, including ships at sea;

<li>Evaluate telemedicine's impact on patients and health care 

providers and on military readiness;

<li>Investigate applications of emerging telemedicine 

products, technologies and services.
</ul>
<p>
	Currently, Akamai fields two basic services. The first is 

teleconsultation. This uses full-motion, real-time video and 

allows doctors to consult with other medical personnel in remote 

areas. It is being used primarily on Kwajelein Island. The second 

is a concept called "store and forward."
<p>
	The latter allows health care providers at distant locations 

to store information by modem to a computer file, using the 

Digital Satellite Network. Specialists at Tripler can then 

retrieve the information and evaluate it, Gelish explained. They, 

in turn, store the results of their evaluations and treatment 

recommendations for later retrieval by the attending provider. 

The concept eliminates barriers created by the Pacific Ocean's 10 

time zones.
<p>
	"Over 24 months, we performed more than 300 telemedicine 

consults," Gelish said. "About 95 percent of those could be done 

by 'store and forward.'"
<p>
	The concept impacts military readiness, Gelish said. "For 

example, with telemedicine we may be able to treat a sick crew 

chief at Kunsan [Air Base, Korea] instead of evacuating him. That 

means a lot to the commander trying to launch [fighter aircraft] 

sorties.
<p>
	"Usually, all that doctors [at understaffed locations] need 

is 'telementoring,' and their level of confidence goes up." With 

Akamai's store and forward capability, he said, "an experienced 

subspecialist is looking over your shoulder 24 hours a day."
<p>
	As a result, Gelish said, medical evacuations decrease, and 

physicians can make smarter, earlier decisions about the level of 

care their patients need. In this way, he said, the services and 

the individuals both benefit.
<p>
	The ongoing telemedicine project supports operations in 

Micronesia; Coast Guard ships at sea; Hickam Air Force Base, 

Hawaii; and Madigan Army Medical Center, Wash., the next nearest 

major DoD medical center. The project includes a deployable 

telemedicine unit at Hickam, and technicians now are installing a 

medical diagnostic imaging support system to provide picture 

archiving and communications to support digital radiology at 

Tripler and remote sites.
<p>
	The 15th Medical Group, Hickam, is using the first 

deployable teleradiology unit in the world, said then-group 

commander Col. Horace Carson. Teleradiology, Carson explained, 

reduces the cost of obtaining X-rays by replacing expensive film 

with basically free digital images. The process also saves time.
<p>
	"Before, couriers had to hand-carry film X-rays to Tripler 

Army Medical Center (about a 30-minute drive from Hickam), where 

radiologists could read them and provide evaluations," Carson 

said. "Now, we have T-1 [telecommunication lines] directly to 

Tripler and can transmit the images immediately." 
<p>
	Master Sgt. James North, noncommissioned officer in charge 

of radiology at Hickam, said the deployable telemedicine unit can 

endure any field conditions. "Temperatures aren't a factor 

because we don't have film to protect," he noted. Besides sending 

digital images back to Tripler, he said, medics in the field can 

print the image on normal bond paper.
<p>
	Akamai is in the fourth year of a five-year contract set to 

expire in fiscal 1997. Three contractors are demonstrating their 

equipment, Gelish said, and evaluators will determine which 

products best suit the delivery of telemedicine in the Pacific 

region. Since the contract began, he added, more than 300 

consults have occurred.
<p>
	Early on, providers in the field resisted "outside advice," 

Gelish said. "But after using it awhile, they like it a lot."
<p>
	The project will expand to Okinawa and Guam this summer, and 

then to Korea, he said. The main islands of Japan, which already 

have a robust medical system, don't need Akamai, he said.
<p>
	With the Western Pacific lined up, Akamai is now also 

pointing back toward North America. A new hospital currently 

under construction at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, will be 

completely digital, Gelish said. Akamai, he said, will help make 

this next building block in military medicine "clever, smart and 

best."
