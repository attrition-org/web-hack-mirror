<p>1. <b>Background</b> -- Since the 1960s, there have been numerous attempts 
  to advance telecommunications technology to augment health care delivery. Yet, 
  despite the simplicity and apparent logic of the concept and three decades of 
  experience, we are unable to show that telemedicine improves access, reduces 
  cost, or affects the quality of health care. There are few well- designed studies 
  and generalizing the findings to the military health care system and patient 
  populations may not be valid. Consequently, there is clearly a need for well 
  designed research in this area. The current evaluation research program consists 
  of four projects that address the following domains: Clinical Outcomes; Patient/Provider 
  Satisfaction; Organizational Impact; and Cost/Effectiveness. The protocol employs 
  a randomized design to compare patient and process outcomes of two methods of 
  consultation (telemedicine and usual care). The sample population for this study 
  is active duty and retired military and their dependents requiring consultation 
  from a primary care (Hickam) to a tertiary care (Tripler) facility and their 
  health care providers. The study uses store and forward technology in a Web-based 
  paradigm.

<a name="mission">
<p>3. <b>Mission Statement</b> -- Before telemedicine consultations are used as 
  a substitute for usual care in which the patient and consultant meet in a clinical 
  encounter, we must demonstrate through objective and measurable outcomes the 
  equivalency of both methods of consultation in providing health care. 
<p>&nbsp;
<a name="goals">
<p>4. <b>Goals and Objectives</b><br>
<p>A. Objectives -- The objective of the overall project is to provide a scientific 
  evaluation of outcomes resulting from insertion of telemedicine into a primary 
  care clinic that routinely refers patients to a tertiary medical care center. 
  Objectives of the four individual research domains are: 1) to investigate if 
  telemedicine consultation between medical treatment facilities: (a) impacts 
  the clinical outcome of patients compared to usual care; (b) affects patient 
  and provider satisfaction compared to usual care and (c) reduces cost in relation 
  to benefits compared to usual care; 2) to evaluate the human impact on providers 
  of performing consultations using advanced telecommunications technology; and 
  3) to investigate the organizational changes that occur when telemedicine is 
  implemented in a medical treatment facility.<br>
<p>B. Goals -- The major goal of the AKAMAI evaluation effort is to provide health 
  care policy-makers with scientific information to assist them in the decision 
  to augment DoD medical treatment facilities in the Pacific Basin with telemedicine 
  technology.

<p>5. <b>Current Status</b><br>
<p>A. Primary Accomplishments<br>
<p>Project #1: Clinical Outcomes: Significant progress has been made in establishing 
  an infrastructure for transmission of consult data. A Web-based paradigm will 
  be used. The Medical Information Data Archiving System (MIDAS) has been developed 
  for 12 specialty areas. Training and tools (MedQuest) have been provided to 
  enable modification/update of screens and creation of new ones. Specialists 
  from Dermatology and Orthopedics have reviewed screens in their areas. A &quot;patient 
  trajectory analysis&quot; has been explored as the major analysis tool. Once 
  the infrastructure is operational, an Experiment Verification Test (EVT) will 
  test procedures, systems, and coordination. After refinement, data collection/analysis 
  will commence. <br>
<p>Project #2: Patient/Provider Satisfaction: Once the systems for telemedicine 
  consultation are operational for at least 2 to 3 months, focus groups evaluating 
  patient and provider satisfaction will be conducted. Arrangements are currently 
  underway to conduct the preliminary focus groups.<br>
<p>Project #3: Organizational Impact: An inventory has been identified which measures 
  cognitive perceptions of the caregivers job characteristics. The medical decision 
  making process has been identified as the variable to be measured and qualitative 
  research methodology of ethnography has been adopted as the operative tool. 
  An inventory assessing organizational learning has been chosen as the measuring 
  instrument. Currently, the team is finalizing evaluation instruments and preparing 
  procedures to test these instruments during the EVT phase.<br>
<p>Project #4: Cost-Effectiveness: Currently, refinement of an initial cost/benefit 
  model is underway based on a high-level process flow diagram for the telemedicine 
  consults. The cost/benefit model will continue refinement through the EVT phase. 
  Procedures for the EVT are currently being written. 
<p>&nbsp;
<a name="strategic">
<p>6. <b>Strategic Direction</b> -- This project will pilot evaluation methodology 
  in Dermatology and Orthopedics. Successful completion will enable additional 
  specialties to be brought on-line and thus expand the scope, value, and application 
  of the basic study methodology.

<p>9. <b>Summary</b> -- Significant strides in infrastructure development have 
  been made and will enable a high-fidelity EVT to take place in December 97/January 
  98. Currently, the project team is preparing procedures and instruments for 
  the EVT. Resulting refinement will enable the trials (data collection) and analysis 
  to take place mid-1998. Final data analysis and reporting will take place September 
  through December, 1998.
