              to the PACMEDTek attendees, sponsors, <img src="images/adams.gif" width="200" height="234" align="LEFT">speakers, 
              chairs and symposium planners! The PACMEDTek Symposium was a tremendous 
              success thanks to the efforts of many staff members and the high 
              caliber curriculum that was offered. As you know, Conference Proceedings 
              will be published this Fall, which will include all the presentations, 
              plus this conference website link has been established to further 
              enhance the distribution of conference information. It is my hope 
              that the lectures and information that were provided at the Symposium 
              will be quoted and shared throughout the Military Health System 
              and the private sector health care community for years to come. 
              Please visit the <a href="glance.htm">web link </a>frequently to 
              view the presentation materials, and/or be "hot linked" to other 
              sites covering similar topics. I wish each of you success in your 
              upcoming FY99 clinical initiatives, and hope you consult and/or 
              partner with the <a href="../index.html">Pacific 
              Regional Program Office</a> staff on a frequent basis! Thanks again 
              for making the PACMEDTek Symposium a success!</font></p>
