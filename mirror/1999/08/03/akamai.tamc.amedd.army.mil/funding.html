        <p><b>SUMMARY: </b></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Pacific Regional Program Office (PRPO) will be requesting the 
              submission of telemedicine research abstracts on February 15, 1998. 
              A Program Guide will be published February 15, 1998, describing 
              the conditions and guidelines under which proposals will be received, 
              reviewed, evaluated and selected by the Akamai Telemedicine Research 
              Program. PRPO will determine which proposals are funded. </p>
            <p>Akamai is a DOD Congressionally funded program designed to demonstrate 
              and validate telemedicine concepts and technologies in the Pacific 
              Region. Akamai-supported research is intended to evaluate and document 
              the clinical and economic value of telemedicine and its impact on 
              the delivery of health care services in the Pacific. </p>

        <p><b>RESEARCH PRIORITIES:</b></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p>PRPO is committed to supporting innovative and unique projects 
              that can serve as models for improving health care services delivery 
              in the Pacific. Each project should identify specific problems, 
              requirements and/or needs in the health care system, evaluate the 
              integration of promising cost- effective technologies, enhance current 
              workflow processes and target realistic and measurable outcomes. 
            </p>

        <p><b>ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS:</b></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p>All health care professionals in the DOD are invited to submit 
              proposals. The Principal Investigator (PI) can be stationed at any 
              DOD medical facility. However, it is required that either the PI 
              or one or more of the Co-Investigators be located in the Pacific 
              Region. All research will be conducted and managed in the Pacific.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b>PROCESS: </b></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p>The selection process will be structured using a three-tiered approach. 
              An abstract with a rough cost estimate will be requested as the 
              first step in the application process. Upon receipt, PRPO program 
              staff will begin a preliminary evaluation. If accepted, a pre-proposal 
              will be requested, which will be reviewed by PRPO, along with a 
              selected telemedicine advisory council, using a given set of criteria. 
              If approved, a full scientific proposal will be requested in accordance 
              with the appropriate IRB standard format. Once approved by the IRB, 
              the proposal will be forwarded back to PRPO for final funding consideration.

        <p><b>FUNDING AVAILABILITY:</b></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> Approximately $1 million is available for new research 
            projects in FY 99. Projects previously awarded have ranged from $50,000 
            to $1 million, with the average project funded at $250,000. Project 
            funding is one year in duration. Multi-year projects will be reconsidered 
            for additional funding on an annual basis. </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b>DATES:</b></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> It is anticipated that abstracts be completed by April 
            1, 1998. Applicants will be notified within 30 days following submission, 
            if a pre-proposal will be requested. Full proposals will be due to 
            the appropriate IRB in June 1998. Awards will be announced in October 
            1998 and projects funded during FY99.</blockquote>
