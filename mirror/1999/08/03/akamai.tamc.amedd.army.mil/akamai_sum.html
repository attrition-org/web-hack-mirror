                    is a congressionally mandated Department of Defense (DOD) 
                    telemedicine project designed to deploy and assess the value 
                    of telemedicine and telecommunications technologies in the 
                    military's Pacific region health care system. This is for 
                    the purpose of transferring patient medical data (text, image, 
                    and video) among facilities and all necessary theater locations 
                    in peace and war. </font> </p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The prevailing 
                    AKAMAI telemedicine concept is directing telemedicine and 
                    digital imaging operations throughout the Pacific Region, 
                    including ships at sea. Active telemedicine operations are 
                    currently supporting: Micronesia, U.S. Coast Guard Ships at 
                    Sea, 3rd Medical Group and Bassett Army Community Hospital, 
                    Alaska, 15th Medical Group Hawaii, 121st Evac Hospital, Republic 
                    of Korea, Madigan Army Medical Center, Washington, and US 
                    Naval Hospital Guam as well as the Naval Hospital in Okinawa, 
                    Japan. AKAMAI is tasked to investigate clinically relevant 
                    applications of emerging telemedicine related products, technologies, 
                    and services. This is to include using already established 
                    bandwidth to pass patient information back and forth. Further, 
                    the project seeks to evaluate telemedicine's impact on the 
                    health care delivery system and military readiness. </font></p>
