<p><b><font size="+3" color="#8080FF">T</font></b>he <a href="index.html">Pacific 
  Regional Program Office (PRPO)</a> headquartered at <a href="http://www.tamc.amedd.army.mil">Tripler 
  Army Medical Center</a> on Oahu, Hawaii, heads up several research and prototyping 
  projects designed to meet the needs of Department of Defense personnel in the 
  Pacific theater. Two of these projects are Akamai (a Hawaiian word meaning intelligent 
  or clever) and the Pacific Medical Network project (PACMEDNET). Both projects 
  prototype state-of-the art technology solutions designed to improve healthcare 
  for service men and women and their dependents. <br>
  <br>
  The lessons learned by <a href="akamai_main4.html">Akamai</a> and <a href="pacmed_main4.html">PACMEDNET</a> 
  can benefit healthcare communities who are looking for ways to preserve their 
  investments in existing systems while, at the same time, giving their user constituents 
  access to improved technologies and methods. <br>
  <br>
  The Akamai and PACMEDNET projects are prototyping generic infrastructures for 
  the Department of Defense that eliminate the need for developing multiple interfaces 
  on a single system to communicate with a variety of different systems. The goal 
  is to put technology in the hands of the medical communities and make it as 
  easy to use as surfing the Web. </p>
<p><br>
  <font size="+2" color="#8080FF"><b>Akamai</b></font></p>
<p> In Alaska, where temperatures fall below zero and hundreds of miles separate 
  populated areas, remote clinics meet the basic healthcare needs of personnel 
  stationed in facilities far from Anchorage, Fairbanks, and other cities. At 
  times, personnel come to these facilities with conditions that require consultation 
  from a specialist. In these cases, evacuation of the patient can be an expensive 
  and possibly dangerous undertaking. Similarly, in Korea, where readiness is 
  vital, evacuation of personnel may not be practical. Telemedicine can help meet 
  the needs of patients and healthcare providers in these remote areas. The Akamai 
  telemedicine project is addressing these needs, enabling the generalist to consult 
  with specialists. The goal of this telemedicine project is to evaluate noncritical 
  patients and treat them without evacuating them. <br>
  <br>
  The <a href="T2P2.html">Tripler Telemedicine Prototype Project (T2P2)</a> portion 
  of Akamai is prototying a telemedicine system focused on supporting clinical 
  workflow between remote sites and medical installations. The prototype activities 
  include building a Webbased client workstation to support clinical consultations. 
  Specialists have collaborated to develop consulting data formats, which the 
  generalists fill in and send via the Internet to specialists. Images can be 
  sent as well. <br>
  <br>
  For example, if a soldier reports a sore knee, the generalist examines him, 
  fills in the data format, and sends the consult to Tripler. There, an orthopedic 
  specialist examines the consult and any xray or other image that has been sent 
  and renders an opinion, which is mailed back to the generalist. A videobased 
  help capability being created by the specialists enables the generalist to clarify 
  diagnostic procedures. If information is needed about past conditions, either 
  doctor can obtain a summary electronic patient record by utilizing PACMEDNET 
  technology.</p>
<p> <a href="T2P2.html">T2P2</a> is implementing two clinical formats: dermatology 
  (pigmented lesion) and orthopedics (knee pain). The T2P2 is also seeking to 
  answer questions about resolution of image display, security of Internet transmissions, 
  and incorporation of data in the form of objects. In conjunction with the PACMEDNET 
  project, Akamai is prototyping the exchange of data as DCOM objects and the 
  incorporation of those objects into the consult data formats. </p>
<p><br>
  <font size="+2" color="#8080FF"><b>PACMEDNET</b> </font></p>
<p> Sometimes, however, patients need to be evacuated. Patients who are wounded 
  or who get sick in front-line positions need to be transported back to major 
  medical treatment centers and sometimes to Veterans Administration facilities. 
  The ability of a health care provider to obtain an electronic medical record 
  at the site of treatment and then transfer the record along with the patient 
  is important in providing improved medical care, particularly during emergencies. 
</p>
<p><a href="pacmed_main4.html">PACMEDNET</a> makes use of state-of-the art technological 
  solutions to address problems associated with patient movement in the Pacific, 
  where large distances and multiple time zones offer special challenges. <a href="pacmed_main4.html">PACMEDNET</a> 
  began in March 1995 under the management of Air Force Lt. Col. Anthony Gelish. 
  An integrated project team consisting of SAIC as the prime contractor, GTE, 
  Northrup Grumman, and PRC, worked to develop and test a prototype during demonstrations 
  and exercises. </p>
<p><a href="pacmed_main4.html">PACMEDNET</a> has engineered several technological 
  solutions which have the potential for wider application outside of the Pacific 
  Region. These innovations include the Transportable Computer-based Patient Record 
  (TCPR) and an architecture that supports transmitting the record to other locations. 
</p>
<p><br>
  <font size="+2"><b><font color="#8080FF">Transportable Gomputer based Patient 
  Record (TCPR)</font></b></font> </p>
<p> Both the military and civilian sectors are in the process of defining what 
  should be contained in a Computer Patient Record. PACMEDNET prototyped a Transportable 
  Computer-based Patient Record (TCPR) which contains a summary of patient data 
  that is useful to move with a patient who is being evacuated. This data includes 
  information such as demographics, inpatient medications, allergies, inpatient 
  episodes, appointments, laboratory results, radiology data, immunization records, 
  and data from instruments such as the Mobile Medical Monitor (M3). </p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><font size="+2"><b><font color="#8080FF">The System Architecture</font></b></font> 
</p>
<p> The PACMEDNET project faced the challenge of moving from a hostcentric system 
  architecture to a more modular approach that would allow greater flexibility. 
  PACMEDNET sought to engineer a client server architecture to facilitate data 
  exchange between systems without adversely affecting those systems. These systems 
  include: CHCS, TRACES, DHCP, Medical Information Carrier (MIC), Mobile Medical 
  Monitor (M3), and offboard clinical systems, including the Akamai telemedicine 
  workstation.</p>
<p> PACMEDNET incorporates several architectural innovations including OffBoard 
  Server (OBS). OBS was designed to remove the host system burden of processing 
  incoming messages from several systems. The OBS resides on a hardware platform 
  compatible with the Windows NT operating system, and uses a relational database. 
  Software on the OBS extracts patient data from contributing systems, formulates 
  the record, and transmits it over a Wide Area Network (WAN) to a receiving facility. 
</p>
<p>An Interface Engine (IE) also runs on the OBS to provide generic interfaces 
  with HL7 messages from multiple systems. The IE was originally designed as placeholder 
  technology. DoD anticipated procuring an off-the-shelf interface engine to provide 
  generic interface with HL7 messages from multiple systems. However, the procurement 
  did not meet the schedule needs of the PACMEDNET project. The IE that PACMEDNET 
  prototyped runs under the WindowsNT operating system on a PC and is a costeffective 
  government off-the-shelf product that could be implemented by multiple projects 
  within the DoD. </p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><b><font size="+2" color="#8080FF">Master Subiect Index <br>
  (MSI) </font></b></p>
<p> In order to gather data from different facilities about patients, information 
  about where they have received care is needed. The Master Subject Index (MSI), 
  a central component of the PACMEDNET system, fills this need. The MSI contains 
  three indices: the Master Patient Index, which stores locators for patient information 
  residing on CHCS and other systems; the Master Patient Locator which stores 
  locators for sites that a patient has visited for medical treatment; and the 
  Master Provider Index, which stores information about which health care providers 
  have access to patient information. One function of the MSI server is to provide 
  a requesting OBS with an index of locations where each patient has been treated, 
  allowing the patient's TCPR to be compiled from information found at these locations. 
  The MSI also determines if there are images available for the patients and on 
  what systems these images reside.</p>

  </font></b><br>
</p>
<p>The DoD is investigating portable electronic media for the capture and transport 
  of soldier information including medical data. PACMEDNET has successfully integrated 
  the ability to utilize a Medical Information Carrier (MIC). When the soldier 
  is brought to a treatment facility, the card is scanned and data is uploaded 
  from the card. Using the card to register the patient allows for faster and 
  more accurate processing than does registering the patient manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="+2"><b><font color="#8080FF">The Mobile Medical Monitor (M3) </font></b></font></p>
<p>The Mobile Medical Monitor (M3) is a system comprised of a ruggedized PC and 
  FDA-certified medical instruments that allow heart rate, blood pressure, and 
  blood oximetry to be monitored remotely and automatically uploaded to a receiving 
  system. PACMEDNET prototyped the capability to capture and upload M3 data and 
  incorporate it into the TCPR. <br>      
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font color="#8080FF" size="+2">Theater Medical Data Store (TMDS) </font></b><br>      
</p>
<p>Systems other than CHCS contribute to the TCPR. In some cases, these systems 
  do not have a permanent place to store data. This is especially true of instruments 
  to be used on the battlefield, such as the M3. This transient data is referred 
  to as &quot;orphan&quot; data since it has no parent system. The TMDS is the 
  &quot;orphanage&quot;, a home for the data. The TMDS can capture information 
  for a specific military engagement or location as well, giving the option to 
  isolate data relating to a specific military engagement. <br>

<p><font size="+2"><b><font color="#8080FF">Transmitting the Record </font></b></font><br>      
</p>
<p>The culminating activity of each phase of PACMEDNET is a demonstration in which 
  defense networks transport the patient record. The demonstrations and exercises 
  in which the PACMEDNET program has participated include: Tripler Army Medical 
  Center (August 1995), Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (August 1995), 
  Cobra Gold Exercise (May 1996), Primetime 3 Phase 4, Ft. Gordon, Georgia (November 
  1996), and Kernel Blitz 97 (June-July 1997). <br>

<p><b><font size="+2" color="#8080FF">Significant Results</font></b> <br>        
</p>
<p>The goal of Akamai and PACMEDNET for the next year is to make medical consultation 
  accessible to remote areas on a regular basis rather than just during demonstrations 
  and exercises. The Akamai/PACMEDNET prototype will be used by sites in Korea 
  and Alaska as a model to assess and quantify the benefits of telemedicine. The 
  Alaska effort will analyze utilizing telemedicine in remote regions. The Korea 
  effort will assess utilizing telemedicine in a geographically distant area. 
  Using the Internet to move patient information, the Akamai and PACMEDNET capabilities 
  will be merged with other technologies to allow providers in these remote regions 
  to have access to consultants in Hawaii and other locations on the U.S. mainland. 
  The goal will remain to provide improved health care to the Pacific region while 
  prototyping cost-effective, state-of-the-art technological solutions. <br>          
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="+2" color="#8080FF">EuroCHCS</font></b> <br>      
</p>
<p>The philosophy of the Akamai and PACMEDNET efforts has been to prototype technological 
  solutions as proofs-of-concept in the anticipation that subsequent efforts would 
  utilize elements of the prototype to solve real-world problems. This philosophy 
  has been borne out by the EuroCHCS project. </p>
<p>EuroCHCS took an early version of the PACMEDNET prototype and adapted it for 
  production use at European DoD hospitals. The three EuroCHCS Alpha sites are 
  the Army hospital, <a href="http://www.lrmc.amedd.army.mil/">Landstuhl Regional 
  Medical Center (LRMC)</a>, in Germany; the Air Force Hospital in Aviano, Italy; 
  and the Naval Hospital in Naples, Italy, making this a joint service effort.</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.lrmc.amedd.army.mil/">Landstuhl Regional Medical Center</a> 
  in Germany serves as a hub for medical operations in continental Europe and 
  so was selected for the location of the system's Master Patient Index (MPI). 
  As part of the EuroCHCS project, the hospitals uploaded patient demographics 
  information into the Master Patient Index (MPI). Off-board servers that function 
  as servers for the build of a patient's TCPR were installed at the three sites. 
  Users have the ability to generate TCPRs using either client-server functionality 
  or VT terminals. To enable the PACMEDNET prototype for production use, the system's 
  reliability, maintainability, and availability features were addressed.</p>
<p> The PACMEDNET features are used to transfer patient information between sites. 
  Users incorporated the functionality in unexpected ways. The system is used 
  locally to compile comprehensive synopses of patient information. Feedback from 
  the site has been extremely positive; approximately 20 TCPRs are generated per 
  day; approximately 3,000 were generated to date in the six months that the system 
  had been available. The prototype software will be incorporated into CHCS Version 
  4.6 so that the five clinical functional modules incorporated by the PACMEDNET 
  effort will become part of baseline CHCS. These functionalities include immunizations, 
  progress notes, problem lists, discharge summaries, and consults.</p>
<p> As the PACMEDNET prototype evolves, features being added will help European 
  sites accomplish their goals. A March demonstration in Washington D.C. showed 
  regional Master Subject Indices and a worldwide Master Subject Index. These 
  indices can link European, National Capital Area, and Pacific regional sites 
  so that Transportable Computer-based Patient Records can be exchanged between 
  these vital areas. The ability to exchange data with Veterans Affairs hospitals 
  and other disparate systems will also be demonstrated. </p>
<p>Input from current users of EuroCHCS, future users in Alaska and Korea, and 
  from those viewing the demonstration in March will be considered in the design 
  of the next iteration of the Akamai/PACMEDNET prototype. </p>
