        <p>In this century, we have witnessed the rapid emergence of technology 
          and, with it, the ability to break significant barriers previously hindering 
          human progress. For example, through advanced aeronautical technology, 
          we have broken the <i>sound barrier </i>and are now able to fly aircraft 
          through Mach velocities. Through rocket propulsion technology we have 
          broken the gravity barrier<i>, </i>enabling humankind to visit the moon, 
          routinely orbit Earth, and claim space flight as a frontier of human 
          destiny. Currently we are standing on the edge of another barrier that 
          is rapidly eroding-the <i>physical distance barrier. </i>Through telecommunications 
          and <i>computer technologies, </i>such capabilities as telepresence, 
          real-time or stored multimedia information transfer, and real-time interactive 
          video enable instantaneous acquisition of knowledge and expertise (whenever 
          and wherever we need them). We have the means and ability to electronically 
          transport the &quot;essence&quot; of who we are -mental, visual, and, 
          in the future, &quot;tactile-to remote destinations without transporting 
          our physical being!</p>
        <p>At the present time, nowhere is this distance barrier eroding more 
          rapidly than in medicine. Patients traveling miles to see a specialist 
          for medical consultation, and medical documents and films being physically 
          stored and physically transported are becoming antiquated modes of operation. 
          Medicine now has a powerful fuel behind it enabling it to operate in 
          a more distance-independent manner. This fuel is telemedicine.</p>
        <p>Telemedicine has obvious rural applications; however, it can also potentially 
          unite the world through a global health network making it possible to 
          reach developing and third world countries and effectively respond to 
          international disasters. Telemedicine continues to gain importance in 
          manned space efforts and military operations where distance and time 
          place heavy restrictions on patient transport to remote medical expertise. 
          In fact, the basic telemedicine framework was derived from deliberate 
          engineering and technology transfer, much of it from the space and aviation 
          fields.</p>
        <p>The aeronautical engineering student of today may well find a future 
          career in the telemedicine field. Telemedicine has grown to encompass 
          satellite technology, telemetry, communications, telepresence, virtual 
          reality, robotics, and creative applications of space/aerospace technologies 
          to medical problems and procedures. The purpose of this paper is to 
          present a brief overview of telemedicine, its strong aerospace technology 
          beginnings, and its emerging future whose success and progress will 
          depend on teams of individuals skilled in engineering, technology transfer, 
          and medicine.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Telemedicine Defined</b></p>
        <p>Telemedicine is the use of modern telecommunications and information 
          technologies to provide health care to individuals when the health care 
          provider and patient are physically separated. Instead of transporting 
          the patient to the site of the expert caregiver, expert knowledge is 
          transported to the health care provider closest to the patient (i.e., 
          move the information not the patient). Telemedicine includes the diagnosis, 
          treatment, and monitoring of patients using systems that allow ready 
          access to expert advice and patient information. It involves a spectrum 
          of technologies. These technologies can include facsimile, medical data 
          transmission, audio-only format (telephone and radio), still images, 
          and full-motion video. Robotics and virtual reality interfaces are being 
          steadily introduced into experimental applications.</p>
        <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department 
          of Defense (DoD) have had an early and long-standing interest in the 
          development of telemedicine. Transfer of NASA and DoD technology as 
          well as independent efforts driven by the need for specific telemedicine 
          solutions have resulted in numerous applications for a variety of population 
          groups and scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Worldwide, forward deployed U.S. forces.</li>
          <li>Monitoring and consultation of astronauts in space.</li>
          <li>Triage and emergency health care response during disasters.</li>
          <li>Services to institutionalized populations in homes for the disabled, 
            nursing homes, or jails and penitentiaries.</li>
          <li>Monitoring and consultation for hospitalized, ambulatory, and home 
            care patients.</li>
          <li>In addition, the possibility of adding telemedicine capability on 
            commercial and military aircraft is gaining interest.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Telemedicine Infrastructure</b></p>
        <p>The telecommunications infrastructure provides the technology to move 
          information electronically between geographically dispersed locations. 
          Participating sites are linked through electronic networks. The telecommunication 
          medium utilized by telemedicine programs is determined in large part 
          by the available local infrastructure. These can include satellite, 
          microwave link, and terrestrial and submarine lines (either twisted 
          copper phone lines or fiber optic cable). Tools specifically designed 
          for ISDN represent an inexpensive, but nevertheless powerful, terrestrial 
          network that is already available in most industrial regions.</p>
        <p>The medical systems infrastructure consists of the equipment and processes 
          used to acquire, present, store, and retrieve clinical information and 
          data. Acquisition and presentation technologies include teleconferencing, 
          data digitizing, and display (e.g., remote X-ray, laboratory tests); 
          text processors (e.g., scanners, fax); or image processors (e.g., video 
          cameras, monitors). Data storage and retrieval include storage devices 
          (disks, tape, CD-ROM), along with technology to compress, transmit, 
          and store data.</p>
        <p><b>Telemedicine and the Space Program</b></p>
        <p>NASA has long used telemedicine for its astronauts<sup>2 </sup>and 
          continues to rely on this mode of in-flight medical consultation. More 
          recently NASA has established telemedicine links with former Soviet 
          republics for disaster relief.<sup>3</sup>A Specifically, the Space 
          Bridge to Armenia/Ufa project provided assistance to persons involved 
          in the 1989 earthquake in Armenia and a major gas explosion in Ufa. 
          This project was the longest running telemedicine disaster relief effort 
          on record. It has technologically and philosophically paved the way 
          for utilizing satellite uplinks and efficiently planned protocols to 
          provide medical care regardless of distance.</p>
        <p>The Space Bridge project provided medical consultation 10 several Armenian 
          regional hospitals, linking them via satellite with four American medical 
          centers. The program utilized two-way interactive audio with one-way 
          full motion video transmitted from Armenia to the United States. There 
          were also separate data and fax transmission lines. Consultation was 
          provided in the areas of neurology, orthopedics, psychiatry, infectious 
          disease, and general surgery. In a separate link, consultation was also 
          provided to the Russian town of Ufa, where a gas explosion during this 
          same period of time caused a large number of casualties. Slow-scan black 
          and white video was transmitted from Ufa to one of the Space Bridge 
          sites in Armenia (Yerevan), which provided satellite uplink.<sup>5 </sup>Over 
          a 12-week period, the Space Bridge program was used to discuss the cases 
          of 209 patients. According to data reported by Houtchens et al.,<sup>3 
          </sup>the use of telemedicine was responsible for changes in the management 
          of a large number of patients. For the 189 Armenian patients discussed, 
          diagnoses were changed for 54 patients, new diagnostic studies were 
          recommended for 70 patients, and treatment plans were changed for 47.</p>
        <p>Similarly, a Space Bridge to Moscow was used to provide consultations 
          regarding persons injured in the civil insurrection of October 1993. 
          During the attempted coup in the second half of 1993, NASA took advantage 
          of a videoconferencing link in Moscow that was already in place to provide 
          consultation regarding several casualties of small arms fire. This link 
          was part of the U.S./Russian telemedicine Demonstration Project, which 
          consisted of 18 different sessions dedicated to various medical specialties.</p>
        <p>Telemedicine has been utilized on many different occasions; however, 
          it has never before been deployed and tested on such a large scale as 
          was demonstrated in the Space Bridge projects. Ferguson, Doarn, and 
          Scott<sup>6</sup> have surveyed the Space Bridge projects, other NASA 
          telemedicine activities, and various non-NASA telemedicine applications 
          throughout the world. Interested readers are encouraged to consult this 
          particular paper for expanded reading.</p>
        <p><b>Astrotelemedicine</b></p>
        <p>As mentioned, telemedicine is not a new concept to space flight. Since 
          its very beginning, space medicine has utilized communications and information 
          processing technologies. In many aspects the operational boundary conditions 
          in space medicine, such as remoteness, telediagnostics, and biotelemetry 
          are characteristic of telemedicine applications on Earth. Since the 
          1960s, in parallel, the United States and Russia served as pathfinders 
          in the development of space telemedicine when they developed capabilities 
          for remote medical monitoring and care for astronauts in their human 
          space flight programs, beginning with Mercury and Vostok, through the 
          current Space Shuttle and Mir programs. In general, medical conferences 
          are held between the crew surgeon and crew members, and during extra-vehicular 
          activity, astronauts are constantly monitored via telemetry. This type 
          of medical monitoring has existed for decades. For example, during the 
          Apollo lunar excursions, EKG, heart rate, oxygen consumption, heat production, 
          suit carbon dioxide levels, and other physiological and environmental 
          variables were monitored by a biomedical team at NASA's Mission Control 
          Center at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. Flight surgeons 
          were on alert to catch potentially dangerous physiological events and 
          intervene at the earliest possible moment.<sup>7</sup></p>
        <p>Currently NASA has in place a training program that would enable astronauts 
          who are not medically trained to be providers of remote telemedicine 
          services (i.e., able to conduct a basic examination for consulting physicians 
          on Earth). Complicating the provision of such services is the fact that 
          the astronauts must learn to perform these tasks in a micro gravity 
          environment. NASA has recently developed the capacity for private medical 
          conferencing from orbiting spacecraft to Earth stations. Prior to this, 
          telemedicine consultations had to be done via radio or video channels 
          that were potentially open to the public. In the current system, the 
          transmitted data are encrypted and transmitted to the Johnson Space 
          Center, via White Sands Missile Base, New Mexico. These one-way (Shuttle 
          to Earth) video and two-way audio signals are received in unscrambled 
          form only by the chief medical officer in Houston, protecting the confidentiality 
          of astronauts and allowing NASA to limit media coverage of medical problems 
          in space.</p>
        <p>Development is continuing for telemedicine to support U.S. astronauts 
          aboard the Russian Mir Space Station and the International Space Station 
          at the turn of the century. NASA's first permanent, operational, international 
          space telemedicine system will be established to support NASA's flight 
          surgeons and astronauts training in several locations in Russia, including 
          the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, the TsUP (Mission 
          Control) at Kalingrad, several sitC5 in Moscow, and the Baikinor Cosmodrome 
          in Kazakhstan. Utilizing NASA's Program Support Communications Network 
          (PSCN), flight surgeons and astronauts in Russia will be able to obtain 
          telemedicine consultations from the NASA Johnson Space Center.<sup>6</sup></p>
        <p>NASA has recently developed and field tested a small and lightweight 
          prototype telemedicine system called a Telemedicine Instrument Pack 
          (TIP) for potential applications in space as well as remote Earth applications.<sup>8</sup> 
          The TIP resembles a small suitcase and is entirely self-contained. It 
          contains commonly used diagnostic instruments (digital scopes), cameras, 
          and a small flat video monitor. The unit has completed an 8-week field 
          trial on Earth and is scheduled for flight testing in space aboard the 
          Space Shuttle in 1997<sup>9 </sup>.</p>
        <p>In the future, telemedicine capability will be an important component 
          in space crew health care aboard the international Space Station, especially 
          in the prevention and early intervention aspects of disease and injury. 
          In addition, during a medical emergency, telemedical capability can 
          play an <i>im</i>portant 'lifeline&quot; role in the rapid exchange 
          of patient information and access to special medical expertise and crucial 
          instruction. However, if an emergency is life threatening and requires 
          medical treatment, the combined resources of telemedicine and existing 
          onboard medical capability may he limited, requiring medical evacuation 
          to Earth. For missions beyond Earth or-bit, evacuation to Earth may 
          not be an option, and the overall onboard medical capability (including 
          expert computer systems and telemedicine capability in the &quot;store 
          and forward&quot; mode) as well as crew medical expertise will need 
          to be greatly enhanced.</p>
        <p><b>Telemedicine and the Military</b></p>
        <p>The United States armed services have long had an interest and involvement 
          in both mobile health and telemedicine services. In fact, some of the 
          most ambitious global applications of telemedicine and utilization of 
          satellite technology can be found in the military. Recent developments 
          in data compression, fiber optics, satellite communications, computer 
          inter-networking, information technology, advanced medical imaging and 
          diagnostics have combined to provide the U.S. military with the ability 
          to establish a world wide integrated health care delivery network. Various 
          combinations of these technologies have been tested in joint exercises, 
          U.S. Army Advanced Warfighting Experiments (AWEs), aboard deployed naval 
          vessels, in the peacetime Military Health System (MHS), and as part 
          of the support for operations in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Somalia, Haiti, 
          Cuba, Panama, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia.</p>
        <p>Advanced telecommunications technology was used in conjunction with 
          mobile health units during the war in the Persian Guif,'<sup>0 </sup>demonstrating 
          that these two technologies can be integrated, even under difficult 
          geographic and climatologic circumstances, with beneficial effect.'' 
          Computerized tomography (CT) scanners were installed in transportable 
          modular military hospital units and deployed in the Saudi desert just 
          south of the Iraqi and Kuwaiti borders.<sup>10</sup></p>
        <p>Recently, the U.S. Department of Defense established a medicine network 
          that serves U.S. troops in Bosnia and other countries. The telemedicine 
          segment of this project, known as Operation Primetime Ill, is designed 
          to help Army physicians communicate with each other using real-time 
          voice and video for consultation and diagnosis. The communications network 
          in Bosnia is being supported by an Orion-built communications satellite 
          orbiting over the area, thereby providing direct broadcast capability. 
          Using commercially available technology, front-line physicians can transmit 
          x-rays and other medical images to field hospitals for diagnostic support. 
          These same links, which extend to deployed units and small clinics at 
          forward areas in Bosnia, connect Army physicians in Bosnia with physicians 
          at five regional military medical centers in the U.S. The network also 
          offers online medical information, patient administration systems, and 
          information systems.</p>
        <p>Operation Primetime was first established in 1993 to provide telemedicine 
          support to medical units in Macedonia and Croatia. The operation was 
          upgraded to Primetime II in <i>1995 </i>with a 30-fold increase in communications 
          bandwidth that substantially improved the transmission of medical images 
          for diagnostic consultations. The telecommunications, advanced medical 
          diagnostics, and medical informatics provided by Primetime III have 
          resulted in an integrated, worldwide system of telemedicine enabled 
          healthcare delivery. This system extends from operating bases of Bosnia 
          to the major military centers in Washington, D.C., Texas, California, 
          and Hawaii. U.S.-based MHS Medical Centers are responsible for providing 
          local telecommunications, video teleconferencing, teleradiology, and 
          clinical staff support necessary to provide continuous specialty and 
          sub-specialty real-time interactive and &quot;store and forward&quot; 
          teleconsultation support. The selection of medical centers positioned 
          in varying time zones around the globe facilitate 24-hour, 7-days per 
          week support without requiring additional medical staffing. This is 
          a very exciting global telemedicine concept in that telemedical consultations 
          can literally &quot;follow the sun&quot; around the Earth.</p>
        <p>Another wide-area telemedicine project is AKAMAI (a Hawaiian word meaning 
          &quot;clever&quot;), an in-service project for electronic diagnosis 
          and consultation, led by Tripler Regional Medical Center in Hawaii. 
          AKAMAI allows for Tripler (a tertiary medical center) to support a referral 
          area of more than one million square miles and a diverse military and 
          civilian user group throughout the Pacific. The tong-term goal of this 
          project is to expand telemedicine into the Pacific Basin by establishing 
          a Pacific-wide telecommunications system for medical information, including 
          Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), telemedicine consultation, 
          teleradiology imaging, digital patient records, and new technologies 
          as they develop (e.g., telesurgery and telepathology).'<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>The U.S. armed forces are also engaged in a large-scale program of 
          telemedicine research and development. For example, the U.S. Army has 
          experimented with telemedicine to provide care to persons living on 
          remote islands in the Pacific Ocean.'<sup>3</sup> The armed forces also 
          have in place projects to develop capabilities for the distant physiological 
          monitoring of deployed troops and investigation of such technologies 
          as telepresence and virtual reality.'<sup>4 </sup>Thus, the military 
          is poised and ready to take telemedicine to new heights into the new 
          millenium.</p>
        <p><b>Telemedicine Applied to Aviation</b></p>
        <p>The aviation world has always been keenly interested in communications. 
          Since the first balloon flight, communication has been a concern for 
          an aircraft to maintain contact with ground facilities and other aircraft 
          in the vicinity. The goal has always been to maintain a safe operating 
          environment. Today an elaborate array of systems using multiple radio 
          frequency bands, microwaves, satellites, and ground stations' are used 
          to communicate and navigate the airways. Telemedicine represents a natural 
          extension of this ability to transfer information to and from an aircraft 
          while in flight or on the ground. With the increased use of aircraft 
          to transport patients and the increase in the number of people flying 
          in commercial aircraft, telemedicine is surely to become a tool that 
          can be used in many different aviation settings.</p>
        <p>The possibility that a health crisis might strike an airline passenger 
          during flight has prompted discussion and investigation into adopting 
          telemedicine capabilities aboard passenger aircraft. For example, United 
          Airlines is evaluating a remote mobile device to monitor potential patients' 
          vital signs. The monitor was installed on a Boeing 767 and tested for 
          three months. Medical emergencies were simulated and procedures established 
          for monitoring a stricken passenger's vital signs, then respond as needed. 
          The device consists of a brief case-sized laptop computer and monitor 
          that can electronically measure a passenger's EKG, blood pressure, heart 
          rate, blood oxygen saturation, and respiration. The vital signs are 
          transmitted via modem to a United Airlines flight surgeon on the ground 
          who interprets them and offers medical advice.</p>
        <p>In addition to commercial application, other aircraft where telemedicine 
          capability could be useful include military and civilian aircraft for 
          medical evacuation (MEDEVAC). In MEDEVAC aircraft where medical personnel, 
          nurses and, at times, physicians are flown with the patients, the possibility 
          of being able to effectively act upon a telemedicine consultation and 
          intervene in an in-flight medical crisis is an attractive scenario.</p>
        <p>The increasing use of the military in operations other than war in 
          remote regions of the world also increases the likelihood that medical 
          care may have to be rendered to patients within aircraft configured 
          to provide the needed health care. This need is especially true in rapid 
          deployment operations that may preclude the deployment of ground based 
          medical facilities to the site. In these circumstances patients will 
          not be &quot;stable&quot; during transport, as is the case in most flights 
          over long distances. The ability to obtain expert consultation while 
          treating patients in remote areas, whether aboard an aircraft or on 
          the ground in a third world country, may be crucial to providing the 
          care needed to save a critically ill patient.</p>
        <p>As with any new technology used aboard aircraft, there are multiple 
          questions that must be answered in order to provide the capability that 
          is needed in a manner that is safe for the aircraft and provides accurate 
          information. Some of the issues and questions that will need to be addressed 
          for these and other applications of telemedicine use in aviation are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is the medical requirement? What clinical problem aboard the 
            aircraft are we trying to solve?</li>
          <li>What level of technology fulfills the requirement?</li>
          <li>What amount of bandwidth is needed to support the technology selected? 
          </li>
          <li>How will the bandwidth be provided? (e.g., existing llF radio, satellite 
            capability, etc.)</li>
          <li>What aerodynamic considerations need to be taken into account for 
            externally mounting additional antennas?</li>
          <li>What are the legal issues? With greater information and connectivity, 
            will patients have unrealistic expectations concerning what can be 
            done for them? What are the flight safety issues and impacts of any 
            proposed new technology aboard the aircraft? Could the workstations 
            negatively impact navigation equipment tactical or non-tactical radios, 
            or any other onboard electronic systems through electromagnetic interference?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The aviation community is taking notice of the advantages that telemedicine 
          can bring to a flight environment. However, there is still much to be 
          defined and addressed before the first approved system becomes a useful 
          part of an in-flight emergency capability.</p>
        <p><b>New Horizons for the Future</b></p>
        <p>The application of &quot;tele&quot; technologies can be taken beyond 
          the medical consultation and monitoring applications described thus 
          far. The potential is great and the possibilities are only limited to 
          our imagination and ingenuity. The following section presents robotic 
          and virtual reality manifestations of telemedicine technologies currently 
          being developed or planned. And as exciting and futuristic as the following 
          examples may seem, the most awesome aspect is that we have barely begun 
          to scratch the surface of what lies ahead.</p>
        <p><b><i>Telepresence Surgery and Virtual Reality</i></b></p>
        <p>Telepresence surgery is the name coined by Satatva, Green, and Simon 
          <sup>16,17</sup> to describe the application of existing and developing 
          technologies in remote manipulation as applied to surgical procedures. 
          The fundamental principle of a telepresence sLiq2ery system is to extend 
          a surgeon's psychomotor skills and problem-solving abilities to t remote 
          environment. The goal is to project a surgeons manual<b> </b>dexterity' 
          to a remote location while providing real-time tactile and visual feedback 
          from the location to the surgeon. In other words, we are dissolving 
          time and space, allowing the physician to <i>be </i>at a distant place 
          at the same time as another person without needing to travel there. 
          Unlike telerobotic surgery, in which a robotic manipulator is directed 
          by preprogrammed computer instructions, or surgical virtual reality, 
          <sup>19</sup> in which manipulations are performed in a simulated environment, 
          telepresence is a unique human-machine technology that directly' and 
          transparently projects hit-man motion to a remote location.<sup>20</sup> 
          It would be possible to operate at a place that is too distant or dangerous, 
          such as the space station or a battlefield.</p>
        <p>An exciting effort in the area of remote surgery is the current work 
          conducted by Philip Green<sup>21 </sup>of SRI International, the inventor 
          of the Green Telepresence Surgery System. This is a prototype system 
          that permits precise, accurate surgery remotely with all the illusion 
          of being at the actual site. It consists of a remote work site and a 
          surgeon's console, similar to a computer workstation. This system brings 
          together 3-D vision, enhanced dexterity, and the sense of touch (through 
          forcefeedback sensory information). These components provide the realism 
          of actually operating at the remote site. The surgeon is operating on 
          a virtual image in front of him/her. The surgeon's abilities are enhanced 
          and surgery can be performed with greater skill and precision than teleoperations 
          procedures using a conventional control interface. The current version 
          is a one-handed 5-degree-of-freedom system with paired CCD cameras for 
          stereo vision; the next generation will have two 6-DOF surgical hands 
          and a stereoscopic laparoscope to replace the fixed cameras. The first 
          prototype had the surgical console directly wired to the remote workstation 
          and is being updated to a wireless system for remote operations. A military 
          application of this system is to mount it in an armored mobile vehicle 
          and posit ion it at the fir forward battlefield. When a soldier is wounded, 
          the vehicle will drive to the site where the soldier is located allowing 
          the surgeon at the hospital to operate immediately upon the casualty 
          on the front lines. Once the system is perfected, it can be transitioned 
          to civilian LI SC for disaster relief and emergency care.<sup>2~</sup></p>
        <p>To enhance their work, physicians will also be able to bring in many 
          different digital images, such as the patients CT or MRI scan, and fuse 
          them with real-time video images giving the surgeon a type of &quot;x-ray 
          vision.&quot; In addition, virtual environments can satisfy the need 
          for training in medical and surgical procedures. For decades, pilots 
          have been training on flight simulators that have become so realistic 
          that a myriad of perfect take-off and landings can be safely performed 
          before the first actual flight takes place. So too will the surgeon 
          of the future be able to perfect surgical skills and rehearse the surgical 
          procedure before operating on the first patient. For example before 
          doing a surgical procedure, the surgeon could sit at the workstation 
          and practice on a virtual patient to simulate the operation and then 
          flip a switch and begin operating on the real patient with precisely 
          the same workstation.</p>
        <p>Hon<sup>24</sup> has developed virtual reality laparoscopic surgery 
          simulators consisting of a plasitic torso into which handles of instruments 
          are mounted (to provide force feedback). The virtual abdomen (liver 
          and gall bladder) is graphically displayed on a video monitor and surgeons 
          and students can practice specific procedures. Satava<sup>2</sup> has 
          taken a different approach with a virtual abdomen created for an immersive 
          experience utilizing helmet-mounted display and Dataglove<sup>TM</sup>. 
          Using a virtual scalpel and clamps, the abdominal organs can be operated 
          upon and explored. These examples are but the first of many potential 
          applications of virtual reality for medical and surgical simulation 
          and education.</p>
        <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
        <p>We are standing at the edge of a new frontier that is maturing with 
          the help of a multi disciplinary team of scientists, engineers, and 
          others. The vista before us shows an unfolding story of advances in 
          telemedicine. Embedded within this story are key events and observations: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Aviation and space technologies have provided significant technology 
            &quot;roots&quot;<b> </b>for telemedicine development and will continue 
            to play major roles in its future.</li>
          <li>The Military and Space programs as well as independent rural and 
            health community efforts have provided an historical experience base 
            from which we can judge the value of telemedicine and plan for its 
            future.</li>
          <li>Telepresence surgery and virtual reality are making possible the 
            transport of movement skill. Medical experts will not only consult 
            and advise but also &quot;do.&quot;</li>
          <li>Fertile ground exists for creative individuals planning future careers 
            in telemedicine related 10 its use in aviation and space flight, military 
            battlefield needs, simulator development, telepresence technology 
            development, virtual reality applications, disaster management, and 
            medical outreach to underdeveloped and third world countries.</li>
          <li>Telemedicine has the potential to medically unite the world and 
            make possible the sharing of much needed expertise in times of great 
            need.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the future, a new framework for the modern medical scenario will 
          emerge enabled by the digital communication infrastructure. The physician 
          of the future will be a &quot;digital physician.&quot; Today, almost 
          any information needed about a patient can be acquired electronically. 
          Tomorrow, medical expertise in the form of transmittable psychomotor 
          skills (teleoperation, telemanipulation, and telesurgery) will complete 
          the loop, and medical distance independence will arrive.</p>
        <p>As medicine continues to accelerate technologically, a major question 
          to ask is, &quot;Where does it leave the human?&quot; Intuitively, we 
          know that technology will never totally replace the human health care 
          provider. The potential is high that a significant and positive enhancement 
          of the medical process will result. But are we de-humanizing medicine? 
          How far can technology take us in the healing art? What will be the 
          impact and acceptance of an electronically-generated healing touch? 
          Who knows? We may discover that in machine systems where humans are 
          truly in the loop, our human presence and essence will always be felt. 
          And, for a finite moment, we will become that object which extends our 
          reach.</p>
