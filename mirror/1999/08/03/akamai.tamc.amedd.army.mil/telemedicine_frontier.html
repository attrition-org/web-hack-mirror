      <p align="JUSTIFY">Telemedicine has the potential to have a greater impact 
        on the future of medicine than any other modality and will profoundly 
        alter the medical landscape of the twenty-first century. In the most remote 
        areas, it can bring high-quality health care where none is now available. 
        In global health care, it can enhance and standardize the quality of medical 
        care, including developing countries. In the realm of space flight, it 
        can provide a lifeline to medical expertise and monitoring. Through its 
        mobility, it can provide urgently needed health care In Instances of natural 
        disaster. However, a number of challenges exist in its coordination and 
        implementation on a global scale, specifically in the international and 
        remote disaster scenarios. In the area of spaceflight, telemedicine capability 
        will remain a consultation/information 'lifeline', but additional onboard 
        medical capability and expertise will become crucial complements as missions 
        become more advanced and remote from Earth. C 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.</p>

      </i></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We live in extraordinary times. In this century alone, 
        we have witnessed the rapid emergence of technology and, with it, the 
        ability to break crucial barriers that had previously hindered human progress. 
        Currently we are standing on the edge of a barrier which is rapidly eroding-the 
        physical distance barrier. Through telecommunications and computer technologies, 
        such capabilities as real-time or stored multimedia information transfer, 
        real-time interactive video and instantaneous acquisition of knowledge 
        and expertise, are becoming reality. We have the means to electronically 
        transport and make available the 'essence' of who we are anywhere at anytime.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">At the present time, nowhere is this distance barrier 
        eroding more rapidly than in medicine. Patients traveling miles to see 
        a specialist for medical consultation, and medical documents and films 
        being physically stored and transported are rapidly becoming antiquated 
        modes of operation. Through telecommunications and information technologies 
        medicine can now extend its reach regardless of physical distance through 
        real-time or near real-time two-way transmission of information between 
        places of lesser and greater medical capability and expertise. This capacity, 
        known as <i>Telemedicine, </i>will revolutionize current clinical medical 
        practice, especially for remote or geographically dispersed populations, 
        and will profoundly alter the medical landscape well into the twenty-first 
        century.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The use of telemedicine systems in settings such as hospitals, 
        clinics, long-term care facilities, prisons, and home care is becoming 
        well established and is evolving in effectiveness and efficiency. However, 
        the purpose of this paper is not to discuss these more familiar settings 
        but, rather, to focus on telemedicine at a bold 'frontier' beyond its 
        current and common use. The new frontier is that of delivering specialty 
        care on a planetary or 'global' scale and beyond Earth into the realm 
        of space flight.</p>

      <b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Telemedicine defined</p>
      </b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Telemedicine is the use of modern telecommunications 
        and information technologies for the provision of clinical care to individuals 
        at a distance and the transmission of information to provide that care. 
        The main rationale for the development of telemedicine services has been 
        the desire to provide health services 10 persons whose access to health 
        care is restricted for one or another reason. It includes the diagnosis, 
        treatment, monitoring, and education of patients using systems that allow 
        ready access to expert advice and patient information no matter where 
        the patient or relevant information is located. It involves a spectrum 
        of technologies<sup>1 </sup>including facsimile, medical data transmission, 
        audio-only format (telephone and radio), still images, and full-motion 
        video. Robotics<sup>2 </sup>and virtual reality interfaces<sup>3 </sup>have 
        been introduced into some experimental applications. Telemedicine is a 
        process, not a technology and shifts the paradigm of transporting the 
        patient to the site of the expert care giver to transporting expert knowledge 
        to the health care provider closest to the patient (ie move the information 
        not the patient).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Early expansion of telemedicine was affected by the cost 
        and limitations of the technology. Recent technological advances-such 
        as liber optics, integrated services digital networks (ISDN), and compressed 
        vide~have eliminated or minimized many of these problems, fostering a 
        resurgence of interest in the potential of telemedicine to improve the 
        quality of; and increase access to health care, especially for those who 
        live in remote or under-served areas. Today, the technology is not only 
        better; it is also becoming signiFIcantly less expensive.</p>
      <b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Telemedicine infrastructure</p>
      </b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The telecommunications infrastructure provides the technology 
        to move information electronically between geographically dispersed locations. 
        Participating sites are linked through electronic networks. The telecommunication 
        medium utilized by telemedicine programs is determined in large part by 
        the available local infrastructure. These can include satellite, microwave 
        link or terrestrial lines (either twisted copper phone lines or fiber 
        optic cable).<sup>4 </sup>The use of advanced satellite links is unlikely 
        to become common for medical desktop conferencing and consultation. Tools 
        specifically designed for ISDN represent an inexpensive, but nevertheless 
        powerful, terrestrial network which is already available in most industrial 
        regions. Where ISDN is not available, satellite systems represent an attractive 
        alternative since temporary links and manual dialing lead to major cost 
        reductions compared with standard satellite links.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The bandwidth or bit rate of the transmission medium 
        (terms used to refer to the amount of information that may be sent per 
        unit of time) is a limiting factor on the type of telemedicine system 
        that may be used. For example, narrow bandwidth systems, such as the ‘plain 
        old telephone system’ (POTS) are relatively inexpensive to operate but 
        lack the capacity to transmit full-motion video. Broad bandwidth networks, 
        including fiber optic cable and many satellite systems, are capable of 
        carrying sufficient data to permit the use of interactive, full motion 
        video.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The medical systems infrastructure consists of the equipment 
        and processes used to acquire and present clinical information and to 
        store and retrieve data. Acquisition and presentation technologies include 
        teleconferencing, data digitizing, and display (eg remote X-ray, laboratory 
        tests); text processors (eg scanners, fax); or image processors (eg video 
        cameras, monitors). Data storage and retrieval include storage devices 
        (disks, tape, CD-ROM), along with technology to compress, transmit, and 
        store data. Table l provides examples of typical telemedicine applications 
        currently in use, modes of interaction, types of information transferred, 
        and bandwidth requirements.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In general, each site has the basic equipment for communicating 
        with other sites in its network and the specific applications it has established. 
        The requirements for telemedical services are the same, independent of 
        whether they need to be provided within a clinic (local area), between 
        Clinics and general practitioners (regional or metropolitan area), or 
        on a wide area (international/global scale).</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Many nations have significant telemedicine activities 
        in progress and include internal (domestic) as well as external (international) 
        efforts. The most active nations include the United States, Australia, 
        Canada, France, Germany, the UK, Greece, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland, 
        United Arab Emirates, Norway, Finland and Sweden. Although telemedicine 
        has been practiced for decades, the majority of its applications have 
        been in the developed world. Now that telemedicine has matured in effectiveness 
        and efficiency with concrete medical impact, it is important and timely 
        to ask whether telemedicine may have a role in developing countries. Developing 
        countries face particular problems in the provision of medical services, 
        which relate to the lack of capital, facilities and systems. Roads and 
        transportation are inadequate and difficulties in transporting patients 
        are often encountered. For countries with limited medical expertise or 
        resources, telecommunications can provide a solution to some of these 
        problems.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">A number of challenges exist in international telemedicine 
        development, which may slow the implementation and effective use of this 
        capacity. These include the following:<sup> 5</sup></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">In addition, based on research thus far, and the responses 
        to a questionnaire developed by a committee established by the International 
        Telecommunication Union to study telemedicine, which gathered data with 
        particular reference to developing countries, it is clear that much of 
        the telemedicine activity undertaken around the world has depended on 
        government subsidies. The situation is changing, however, and a trend 
        towards commercial telemedicine provision is clearly discernable.<sup>6</sup></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">One initial effort is the Satellite/HealthNet. Based 
        in the United States, SateLife/HealthNet is an international non-profit 
        organization which uses micro-satellite technology to provide health communication 
        and information services in developing countries. SateLife began in <i>1985 
        </i>and is an initiative of the Nobel Laureate group International Physicians 
        for the Prevention of Nuclear War. It has joined with Atelier Temenos 
        in France to provide island communities with e-mail and CD ROM availability 
        via the HealthSat I and HealthSat 2 (LEO Satellites), at 0.25% of the 
        cost of conventional geostationary satellites. SatelLifel HealthNet stations 
        are also licensed in nine African countries, the Philippines and three 
        countries in the Americas, linking remote practitioners and clinics regionally, 
        as well as internationally with participating urban medical centers.<sup>7</sup></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The development of national telecommunications and telemedicine 
        capabilities in underdeveloped countries can be enhanced by development 
        of an international medical telecommunications network to facilitate communications 
        among health care professionals globally and to improve their access to 
        health care information. Such a network could stimulate the development 
        of medical cooperation across cultural, political, and bureaucratic barriers 
        and could facilitate the development of national telemedicine networks 
        in underdeveloped countries. Such a global network could be built on a 
        simple Internet infrastructure 'low' technology start which can be highly 
        effective.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Global telemedicine will develop regardless of whether 
        it is coordinated logically or not. It will require a concentrated effort 
        to develop reliable national telecommunications capabilities in the underdeveloped 
        countries where they are currently unavailable. Such systems should he 
        developed through collaborative efforts and funding from multiple organizations 
        (eg World Health Organization and other agencies of the United Nations 
        such as the Pan American Health Organization, the Department of Humanitarian 
        Affairs, the US Agency for International Development; and other international, 
        and national, organizations with Interests in developing updated medical 
        and communications technologies in underdeveloped countries).</p>

      <p>Telemedicine and international disaster response</p>
      </b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Disasters are catastrophic events that overwhelm a community's 
        emergency response capacity, threatening the health and safety of the 
        public and the environment. Globally, a major disaster occurs almost daily. 
        Although emergency medical services are an important part of disaster 
        responses, populations affected by disasters require a complete range 
        of health services. Disaster medicine has become more than a mass casualty 
        response. It encompasses the entire spectrum of the affected population's 
        needs, ranging from assessment of the medical requirements to rapidly 
        coordinating routine and preventive health services.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There are three major time phases associated with disaster 
        response. In the Pre-Disaster Phase, emphasis is placed on prevention 
        and preparedness activities which lead to requirements for hazard and 
        vulnerability assessments, human and material resource inventory, comprehensive 
        planning and exercises to test plans, capabilities, and skills. In the 
        Acute Post-Disaster Phase (hours to weeks) damage assessments and the 
        implementation of emergency plans have priority. The Post-Disaster Rehabilitation 
        Phase may extend for months or even years as infrastructure and various 
        community activities are restored.<sup>8</sup></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">While many information management and telecommunications 
        technologies are currently employed in disaster response, there are few 
        reports of telemedicine being utilized in disaster settings. The Pan American 
        Health Organization (PAHO) has provided satellite communication ground 
        stations to support disaster response. The longest and most extensive 
        use of telemedicine was the NASA-Russia Space Bridge employed during the 
        Post-Disaster Rehabilitation Phase after the devastating Armenian Earthquake 
        of l988.<sup>9</sup></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The Space Bridge Project used satellite communications 
        to provide medical consultation to several Armenian regional hospitals, 
        linking them with four US medical centers. The program utilized two-way 
        interactive audio with one-way full-motion video transmitted from Armenia 
        to the United States. There were also separate data and fax transmission 
        lines. Consultation was provided in the areas of neurology, orthopedics, 
        psychiatry, infectious disease, and general surgery. In a separate link, 
        consultation was also provided to the Russian town of Ufa, where a gas 
        explosion during this same period of time caused a large number of casualties. 
        Slow-scan black and white video was transmitted from Ufa to one of the 
        Space Bridge sites in Armenia (Yerevan) which provided satellite uplink.'<sup>0</sup></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Over a 12 week period, the Space Bridge program was used 
        to discuss the cases of 209 patients. According to data reported by Houtchens 
        <b><i>et </i></b><i>al.,<sup>1 </sup></i>the use of telemedicine was responsible 
        for changes in the management of a large number of patients. For the 189 
        Armenian patients discussed, diagnoses were changed for 54 patients, new 
        diagnostic studies were recommended for 70 patients, and treatment plans 
        were changed for 47. During the attempted coup in the second half of 1993, 
        NASA took advantage of a video-conferencing link in Moscow that was already 
        in place to provide consultation regarding several casualties of small 
        arms fire. This link was part of the USJ Russian Telemedicine Demonstration 
        Project, which consisted of 18 different sessions dedicated to different 
        medical specialties.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Evaluation of this entire Space Bridge experience has 
        identified a series of important ‘disaster telemedicine’ needs for future 
        consideration: <sup>12</sup></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">(1) need for precise protocols in both communications 
        and clinical areas;</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">(2) need to intensively train and prepare users at both 
        ends of the link;</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">(3) need for a new type of medical record generated by 
        and compatible with telemedicine;</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">(4) need for vigorous qualitative and quantitative assessments 
        of telemedicine applications;</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">(5) need to link telemedicine to a variety of information 
        sources.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Telemedicine has been utilized on many different occasions 
        over the past two decades; however, it has never before been deployed 
        and tested on such a large scale as was demonstrated in the Space Bridge 
        projects. These projects pioneered a global telemedicine disaster assistance 
        system and demonstrated that the technology and ability to utilize it 
        during a large-scale emergency situation are currently at hand. In addition, 
        these projects clarified the value of such a system and the need to institutionalize 
        this capability nationally and internationally so that it can be effectively 
        activated on demand.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Telemedicine can significantly enhance efforts associated 
        with the previously mentioned time phases identified for disaster response. 
        For example, in the Pre-Disaster Phase, telemedicine could be employed 
        in the education and training of health care personnel and the general 
        community. Disaster planning and coordination could be facilitated and 
        various types of exercises could be conducted and evaluated. In the Acute 
        Phase of disaster, telemedicine capability could support disaster plan 
        implementation and modification, assist with management of critical resources, 
        and provide consultation from within and outside the disaster area, and 
        provide assessment and survey data as the basis for relief and humanitarian 
        assistance operations. In the Post-Disaster Rehabilitation Phase, telemedicine 
        can provide a variety of more traditional medical consultations as demonstrated 
        by the Space Bridge to Armenia and can continue to provide support to 
        both resource management and continuing assessment activities. <b><sup>13</sup></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Telemedicine can be utilized in disasters only within 
        the constraints of local and regional infrastructure capabilities and, 
        thus, must be compatible with and tailored to the level of sophistication 
        which can be utilized and supported. Top down approaches are unlikely 
        to be successful unless matched by intensive local area efforts, both 
        of which must take into account the inherent cultural, technical, and 
        political realities. These factors present the most significant obstacles 
        to the rapid implementation of telemedicine capabilities in disasters 
        and complex emergencies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Although the application of telemedicine to disaster 
        scenarios appears promising and logical, applying telemedicine technology 
        to disaster settings is presently expensive both in terms of initial cost 
        and investment of professional time and effort in the development, teaching 
        and implementation of new practice paradigms and supporting protocols. 
        It can only be employed effectively in disaster settings if it is also 
        in frequent use in the routine delivery of health services. Leveraging 
        a disaster medicine capability by employing it regularly in non-disaster 
        settings should increase acceptance, and proficiency, reduce cost, and 
        increase access to high quality health care. Extending the use of telemedicine 
        to nonclinical areas (pharmacy, supply and equipment, administrative support) 
        and to non-medical sectors of disaster management, increases the power 
        of this leveraging. This parallel development of Disaster Medicine, Telemedicine, 
        and provision of routine health care demands serious attention.'<sup>4</sup></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Telemedicine and the military</p>
      </b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The United States armed services have long had an interest 
        and involvement in both mobile health and telemedicine services. In fact, 
        some of the most ambitious global applications of telemedicine and utilization 
        of satellite technology can be found in the military.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Recent developments in data compression, fiber optics, 
        satellite communications, computer inter-networking, information technology, 
        advanced medical imaging and diagnostics have combined to provide the 
        US military with the ability to establish a world-wide integrated health 
        care delivery network. Various combinations of these technologies have 
        been tested in Joint exercises, US Army Advanced Warfighting Experiments 
        (AWEs), on board deployed naval vessels, in the peacetime Military Health 
        Service System (MHS), and as part of the support for operations in Saudi 
        Arabia, Kuwait, Somalia, Haiti, Cuba, Panama, Croatia and Macedonia.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Advanced telecommunications technology was used in conjunction 
        with mobile health units during the war in the Persian Gulf"<sup>5</sup> 
        demonstrating that these two technologies can be integrated, even under 
        difficult geographic and climatologic circumstances, with beneficial effect.<sup>16 
        </sup>Computerized tomography (CT) scanners were installed in transportable 
        modular military hospital units and deployed in the Saudi desert just 
        south of the Iraqi and Kuwaiti borders.'<sup>7 </sup>During Operation 
        Restore Hope, beginning in February 1993, physicians of the 86th Evacuation 
        Hospital in Mogadishu, Somalia, transmitted still, digitized images and 
        voice messages from a portable 'Standard A' INMARSAT (International Maritime 
        Satellite) terminal to Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) in Washington, 
        DC. Consultative systems at WRAMC were linked to both MEDLINE and the 
        Composite Healthcare System (the Department of Defense medical computer 
        network). A similar system has been deployed to Zagreb, Croatia and the 
        Army's medical center in Landstuhl, Germany, since May 1993. The Navy's 
        Fleet Hospital Six, which took over the United Nations peacekeeping operations 
        in Zagreb, Croatia, from the Army retained the link to WRAMC and also 
        established links to the Naval Medical Center at San Diego.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Recently, the US Department of Defense established a 
        medicine network that serves US troops in Bosnia and other countries. 
        The telemedicine segment of this project, known as Operation Primetime 
        III, is designed to help Army physicians communicate with each other using 
        real-time voice and video for <i>consultation and diagnosis. The </i>communications 
        network in Bosnia is being supported by an Orion-built communications 
        satellite orbiting over the area, thereby providing direct broadcast capability. 
        Using commercially available technology, frontline physicians can transmit 
        X-rays and other medical images to field hospitals for diagnostic support. 
        These same links, which extend to deployed units and small clinics at 
        forward areas in Bosnia, connects Army physicians in Bosnia with physicians 
        at five regional military medical centers in the USA. The network also 
        offers online medical information, patient administration systems, and 
        information Systems. Operation Primetime was first established in 1993 
        to provide telemedicine support to medical units in Macedonia and Croatia. 
        The operation was upgraded to Primetime 11 in <i>1995 </i>with a 30-fold 
        increase in communications bandwidth that substantially improved the transmission 
        of medical images for diagnostic consultations. The telecommunications, 
        advanced medical diagnostics and medical informatics provided by Primetime 
        III Task Force has resulted in an integrated, world-wide system of telemedicine 
        enabled healthcare delivery extending from the forward operating bases 
        of Bosnia to the major military centers in Washington, DC, Texas, California, 
        and Hawaii. Continental US based MHS Medical Centers are responsible for 
        providing local telecommunications<i>, </i>video teleconferencing, teleradiology 
        and clinical staff support necessary to provide continuous specialty and 
        sub-specialty real-time interactive and store and forward teleconsultation 
        support. The selection of medical centers positioned in varying time zones 
        around the globe facilitate 24-hour, 7 days per week support without requiring 
        additional medical staffing. This is a very exciting global telemedicine 
        concept in that telemedical consultations literally 'follow the sun' around 
        the Earth.<sup>18</sup></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The US armed forces are also engaged in a large-scale 
        program of telemedicine research and development. This includes the distant 
        physiological monitoring of deployed troops, and investigation of such 
        technologies as telepresence,<sup>19 </sup>virtual reality, and telerobotic 
        laparoscopic surgery.<sup>20 </sup>The US Army has also experimented with 
        telemedicine to provide care to persons living on remote islands in the 
        Pacific Ocean.<sup>21</sup></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Another wide-area telemedicine project is AKAMAI, a tri-service 
        project for electronic diagnosis and consultation, an effort headed by 
        Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii. AKAMAI allows for Tripler (a tertiary 
        medical center) to support a referral area of over one million square 
        miles and a diverse military and civilian user group throughout the Pacific. 
        The long-term goal of this project is to expand telemedicine into the 
        Pacific Basin by establishing a Pacific-wide telecommunications system 
        for medical information, including Picture Archiving and Communication 
        System (PACS), telemedicine consultation, teleradiology imaging, digital 
        patient records, and new technologies as they develop (eg telesurgery 
        and telepathology).<sup>22</sup></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The US Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense Health 
        Affairs is working with a number of federal agencies and industry to develop 
        an infrastructure to fully exploit the potential for telemedicine and 
        computer-based patient records globally throughout the US Military Health 
        System. The goal is to have technology-based services that allow connectivity 
        among military treatment facilities; interoperability among information 
        systems at military treatment facilities; and commonality among the health 
        care and related applications which run on these information systems. 
        And, finally, to integrate these efforts to their fullest capacity, the 
        Surgeon General of the Army has created a special project office for Advanced 
        Technology and Telemedicine to encourage collaboration within the entire 
        US Department of Defense.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Astro telemedicine</p>
      </b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Telemedicine is not a new concept to space flight. Since 
        its very beginning space medicine has utilized communications and information 
        processing technologies. In many aspects the operational boundary conditions 
        in space medicine, such as remoteness, telediagnostics, and biotelemetry 
        are characteristic of telemedicine applications on Earth.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Since the 1960s, in parallel, the United States and Russia 
        served as pathfinders in the development of space telemedicine when they 
        developed capabilities for remote medical monitoring and <i>care for </i>astronauts 
        in their human space flight programs, beginning with Mercury and Vostok, 
        through the current Space Shuttle and Mir programs. Medical conferences 
        are held between the crew surgeon and crew members, and astronauts during 
        extra-vehicular activity (EVA) are constantly monitored via telemetry. 
        This type of medical monitoring has existed for decades. For example, 
        during the Apollo lunar excursions, EKG, heart rate, oxygen consumption, 
        heat production, suit carbon dioxide levels, and other physiologic and 
        environmental variables were monitored by a biomedical team at NASA's 
        Mission Control Center at the Johnson Space Center (JSC), Texas. Flight 
        surgeons were on alert to catch potentially dangerous physiological conditions 
        or events.<sup>23</sup></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Currently the US Space Program (through NASA) has in 
        place a training program that would enable astronauts who are not medically 
        trained to be providers of remote telemedicine services (ie able to conduct 
        a basic examination for consulting physicians on Earth). Complicating 
        the provision of such services is the fact that the astronauts must learn 
        to perform these tasks in a micro gravity environment. NASA has recently 
        developed the capacity for private medical conferencing from orbiting 
        spacecraft to Earth stations. Prior to this, telemedicine consultations 
        had to be done via radio or video channels that were potentially open 
        to the public. In the current system, the transmitted data are encrypted 
        and transmitted to the Johnson Space Center, via White Sands Missile Base, 
        New Mexico. These one-way (Shuttle to Earth) video and two-way audio signals 
        are received <i>in </i>unscrambled form only by the chief medical officer 
        in Houston, protecting the confidentiality of astronauts and allowing 
        NASA to limit media coverage of medical problems in space.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Development is continuing for telemedicine applications 
        to support US astronauts aboard the Russian Mir space station and the 
        International Space Station at the turn of the century. NASA's first permanent, 
        operational, international space telemedicine system will be established 
        to support NASA's flight surgeons and astronauts training in several locations 
        in Russia, including the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, 
        the TsUP (Mission Control) at Kalingrad, several sites in Moscow, and 
        the Baikinor Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Utilizing NASA's Program Support 
        Communications Network (PSCN), flight surgeons and astronauts in Russia 
        will be able to obtain telemedicine consultations from the NASA Johnson 
        Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas.<sup>24</sup></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Telemedicine capability will be an important component 
        in space crew health care onboard the International Space Station, especially 
        in the prevention and early intervention aspects of disease and injury. 
        In addition, in a medical emergency, telemedical capability can play an 
        important 'lifeline' role in the rapid exchange of patient information 
        and access to medical expertise and crucial instruction. However, if an 
        emergency is life threatening and requires immediate medical treatment, 
        the combined benefits of telemedicine and existing onboard medical capability 
        may be limited, requiring medical evacuation to Earth.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In such a scenario, a crew rescue vehicle or 'ambulance' 
        or even mission abort to return a crew member home may take hours, days, 
        or even months depending on a Variety of circumstances (eg launch and/or 
        landing feasibility, weather conditions, possibility of further patient 
        injury upon reentry/landing, etc.). Given the consideration of passage 
        of time for transport, potential of further injury during transport, etc., 
        in certain cases the patient may indeed be better off treated inflight 
        and/or the situation effectively managed until an appropriate mode of 
        return to Earth is established. In order to provide patient stabilization 
        and management in a crisis, the appropriate array of tools for adequate 
        diagnosis and treatment must be on hand. Indeed, a future medically enhanced 
        space station or facility could provide valuable learning experience for 
        initiating greater crew medical autonomy, such as would be required for 
        interplanetary flight where an 'ambulance' or mission abort may not exist 
        as options (due to distance) in a medical emergency.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Granted, the overall space station experience is still 
        in its infancy (in that so far, only a small population of individuals 
        have flown for extended periods) and critical life-threatening medical 
        emergencies requiring immediate evacuation or rescue have not occurred 
        (astronauts, through selection, are extremely healthy), it is still likely 
        that after the International Space Station becomes operational, a greater 
        number of individuals will visit and work onboard. The possibility therefore 
        exists that a life threatening medical emergency could occur, testing 
        our wisdom and judgment in the types of onboard medical diagnostic and 
        treatment capabilities initially provided. However, at this early stage, 
        it is very difficult to plan for every possible medical emergency that 
        might occur and space flight is still understood to be 'experimental' 
        with definite risk attached to the occupation. In the future, especially 
        in the more advanced and physically distant spaceflight scenarios, the 
        medical provisions and expertise onboard and not necessarily the telemedical 
        capability. may prove to be the most critical factors determining the 
        life or death outcome of an individual in a medical spaceflight emergency.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;<b>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">At this point in time, the claim that telemedicine will 
        introduce revolutionary changes in global health care delivery and information 
        access may seem premature, yet there are clear indications that dramatic 
        changes have already occurred in the medical information infrastructures 
        and vast networks already established. The information age is already 
        upon us in health care. Telemedicine is bringing reality to the vision 
        of an enhanced accessibility of medical expertise and a global network 
        of health care available in any situation. The real question about the 
        future of telemedicine is not whether it is here to stay but rather the 
        extent to which we have the foresight to fully exploit it-building lifelines 
        on Earth and as far as the human spirit dares to dream.</p>
