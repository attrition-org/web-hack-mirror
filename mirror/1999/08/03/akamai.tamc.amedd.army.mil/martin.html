              This is his second term as ASD (HA), his previous term running from 
              January 1993 until March 1994. His arrival at the Pentagon was the 
              result of 15 years of experience in positions such as the Public 
              Health Service and the Department of Health and Human Services. 
              He was commissioned in the Public Health Service in May of 1975 
              and currently holds the rank of Rear Admiral.<br>
              Though he will be retiring this year, he agreed to discuss his vision

        individualized medical care unit, featuring a suite of integrated state-of-thc-art 
        treatment and diagnostic technologies. The LSTAT provides a means of projecting 
        sophisticated trauma care forward towards the site of injury. This will 
        increase survivability rates by reducing the time to delivery of life-saving 
        definitive care.<br>
        <b>Advanced Surgical Suite for Trauma Care (ASSTC)/ Multipurpose Health

        to the site of injuries for aggressive life saving and casualty stabilization. 
        Can be moved in a V-22, slingloaded and/or trailer moved.<br>
        <b>Medical Personal Information Carrier (PIC):</b> Issued to each serviceman 
        and woman, will contain vital information about their health status. In

        What are the top three automation priorities for the Military Health System? 
        How long will it take to implement them?</b></font><b></b>
      <p><br>
        <font size="+2"><b><font color="#800000">A.</font></b></font> My top three 
        automation priorities for the Military Health System are a Computer-based 
        Patient Record (CPR), a Preventive Health/Immunization Tracking system 
        and a Personal Information Carrier (PIC).<br>
        Patient records in the Department of Defense (DoD) military health system 
        are currently paper-based. The Department is developing a longitudinal, 
        comprehensive, CPR that will document the health status of each eligible 
        beneficiary and the healthcare received. Ultimately, the CPR will completely 
        replace the current paper record and will offer new capabilities that 
        will improve the quality of care rendered by healthcare providers and 
        enable the rapid transfer of clinically relevant data between and among 
        providers.<br>
        Efforts to build a healthy community, to deliver a healthy and fit force 
        and to manage the health of a population will be facilitated by the Preventive 
        healthcare System (PHCS). The PHCS will allow providers to deliver, track 
        and report appropriate and timely delivery of clinical preventive services.<br>
        An interim version of immunization tracking is being deployed by the Services 
        now to support the anthrax program. Data from the immunization-tracking 
        module will provide the immunization elements of the CPR.<br>
        The Personal Information Carrier (PIC) leverages promising technology 
        to overcome the challenge of imperfect medical record keeping and documentation, 
        especially during deployments. The PIC is a small, rugged, tag-like device 
        that will be the primary repository of medical force-protection data to 
        include individual readi-ness data, deployable status, casualty prevention 
        training, medical history, problem list and demographic information. The 
        device will be carried by service members and updated by medical personnel 
        whenever the service member is examined or treated.

        Because funding has been increasingly more difficult to acquire over recent

        the military medical tech-nology budget to remain fairly constant in future 
        years. In January 1997, Health Affairs established a set of mission essential 
        goals the Military Health System (MHS) must reach prior to the close of 
        this century in order to accomplish the DoD health mission. Since then, 
        the MHS lnformation Management (IM) community has assessed where the currently 
        are in relation to these goals and specifically what remains to be done. 
        Military Health System Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) 
        oversight and management committees have approved the resulting MHS IM/IT 
        Mission Essential Require-ments (MER) and related funding recommendations.

        focuses on creating information sharing between and among heterogeneous

        to each patient. Through creation of an interface engine, PACM EDNET has 
        successfully shared information between multiple Composite healthcare 
        System sites and the Department of Veteran's Affairs Vista System (formerly 
        Defense healthcare Program). Through creation of a Master Subject Index 
        (MSI ), the project has provided electronic pointers to patient intormation 
        through use of a Master Patient Locator. To insure appropriate protection 
        of patient information the MSI also tracks provider access privileges 
        to virtual data through the Master Provider Index.<br>
        The AKAMAI project enhances the healthcare delivery system and improves

        use of medical technologies and telecommunications capabilities. This 
        is accomplished by investigating clinically relevant applications of emerging 
        telemedicine related products, technologies and services.<br>
        Further, the Project has a major effort to evaluate telemedicine's impact 
        on the healthcare delivery system and military readiness. This includes 
        clinical outcomes, organizational impact, human factors behavior, cost 
        benefit analysis and patient and physician satisfaction.

        <font size="+2"><b><font color="#800000">A.</font></b></font> The Information 
        Management/ Information Technology Program Evolution.<br>
        Working in concert with the Surgeons General, the Military Health System 
        (MHS) Strategic Principles were developed to provide a universal foundation 
        for creation of the Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) 
        Program. A committee of senior executives representing the Secretary of 
        Defense and the Military Departments was formed to provide a focused and 
        unified information management policy for the execution of the program 
        in support of the mission of Health Affairs and the MHS. This committee 
        aligned the program with National Security Objectives, goals of the National 
        Command Authority and directions of Congressional and industry leaders. 
        The IM/IT Program was framed to meet the new challenges of supporting 
        not only the critical Medical Readiness mission of the Department, but 
        also the formidable task of providing day-to-day healthcare to the beneficiaries 
        of the MHS in its evolving managed care environment. The program was designed 
        to ensure that the right information was provided to the right people 
        at the right time to improve and maintain health status across the entire 
        continuum of healthcare operations.<br>
        The evolution of the IM/IT Program has witnessed many profound changes. 
        The relationship of OSD and the Services has been restructured and the 
        roles of the Army, Navy and Air Force Surgeons General enhanced and expanded. 
        As a result, the MHS information management landscape has been permanently 
        changed. The IM/IT Program can claim many successes resulting from its 
        evolution. One of the more important ones is the radically reengineered 
        business process of the Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support Program 
        to adopt just-in-time inventory concepts, electronic commerce, universal 
        product numbers and best price determination. Through implementation of 
        the Prime Vendor Program, Health Affairs has become a leader in DoD and 
        industry in the implementation of Electronic Commerce/Electronic Data 
        Interchange. The strengths of the TM/IT Program foundation have been tested 
        though the requirement to evaluate and implement cutting-edge technology 
        in the MHS.
