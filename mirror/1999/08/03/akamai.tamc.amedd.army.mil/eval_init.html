        <b>Abstract:</b> Telemedicine is the use of modern telecommunications 
        and information technologies for clinical care of individuals at a distance. 
        It has the potential to profoundly alter the medical landscape world-wide. 
        One effort in particular, Project AKAMAI, is contributing to this vision 
        by pioneering the implementation of telemedicine in the Pacific. AKAMAI 
        is a Federally funded program designed to augment health care delivery 
        to DoD and beneficiaries in the Pacific using advanced telecommunications 
        technology. The objective is to provide health care policy-makers with 
        scientific and technical information. AKAMAI, led by Tripler Regional 
        Medical Center (TRMC), Hawaii, consists of 27 individual projects and 
        studies. Among these is a research study evaluating telemedicine in a 
        limited setting (consultation between Hickam Primary Care Clinic, Hawaii, 
        and TRMC in the areas of Dermatology and Orthopedics). The study consists 
        of four sub projects in the areas of Clinical Outcomes, Patient/Provider 
        Satisfaction, Organizational Impact, and Cost/Benefit, with the intent 
        of providing information on the influence of telemedicine insertion into 
        a military health care system. The evaluation study will be conducted 
        in three phases: Phase I (Infrastructure design/instrument and procedure 
        development); Phase II (Experiment Verification Test (EVT) or system/procedure 
        simulation) and Phase III (Experiment/Data Analysis). Phase I is currently 
        in progress.

        <b>Introduction: What is Project AKAMAI?</b> 
      <p>Medicine is an infinite frontier - as infinite as the mysteries of the 
        human body. We are living in an extraordinary time for technology is rapidly 
        changing the face of health care practice, access, and education ushering 
        our planet into a new health care age for the new Millennium. Through 
        telecommunications and information technologies, medicine can extend its 
        reach regardless of physical distance through two-way transmission of 
        information between places of lesser and greater medical capability and 
        expertise. This capacity, known as telemedicine, has the potential to 
        profoundly alter the medical landscape world-wide. One effort in particular, 
        known as Project AKAMAI, is contributing to the fulfillment this vision 
        by pioneering the implementation of telemedicine in the Pacific. 
      <p>&quot;AKAMAI&quot; is a Hawaiian word for clever or smart. It embraces 
        the spirit of using new or improved tools and ideas to do things better. 
        We are becoming &quot;akamai&quot; in the way we practice medicine with 
        new technologies and methods that are expanding medicine's reach and effectiveness 
        with seemingly endless possibilities. Thus, the name &quot;Project AKAMAI&quot; 
        is appropriate for a Federally funded program, led by Tripler Regional 
        Medical Center (TRMC), HI, designed to augment health care delivery to 
        DoD and other beneficiaries in the Pacific using advanced telecommunications 
        technology. The new capability may allow more patients to receive definitive 
        treatment at their local health care facility and thus, avoid the requirement 
        for aeromedical evacuation. 
      <p>The vision of Project AKAMAI is (a) to enhance the health care delivery 
        system by linking Federal agencies with advanced telecommunications capabilities 
        that enable patient information to be transmitted digitally between health 
        care providers in local and remote geographic locations and (b) to improve 
        military medical readiness in the Pacific Basin Region by projecting the 
        medical specialty expertise of TRMC, Hawaii, to remote sites through the 
        use of telemedicine. A major objective of Project AKAMAI is to provide 
        healthcare policy-makers with scientific and technical information to 
        assist them in the decision to employ this telecommunications technology 
        within the scope of capabilities of all DoD medical treatment facilities. 
      <p align="CENTER"><b>Telemedicine Evaluation Study</b> 
      <p>AKAMAI consists of 27 individual projects and studies divided into the 
        broad areas of operations (teleradiology, multimedia systems, needs assessments), 
        evaluation, and emerging technology exploration. Of these, one is a scientifically 
        peer-reviewed and approved research study entitled, &quot;A Pilot Project 
        to Evaluate the Impact of Telemedicine on Health Care Delivery.&quot; 
        Its primary focus is to evaluate telemedicine in a limited military setting 
        between Tripler Regional Medical Center and Hickam Primary Care Clinic, 
        HI. The evaluation study was launched due to the fact that despite the 
        simplicity and apparent logic of the telemedicine concept and three decades 
        of experience, we are still unable to show that telemedicine improves 
        access, reduces cost, or affects the quality of healthcare. 
      <p>The evaluation study consists of four sub-projects, each with a principal 
        investigator and co-investigators representing full research studies in 
        their own right, yet highly interdependent to yield an integrated &quot;big 
        picture&quot; of the influence of telemedicine insertion into the military 
        health care system. The four sub projects address the following research 
        aims: to investigate if telemedicine consultation between medical treatment 
        facilities (a) impacts the clinical outcome of patients compared to usual 
        care; (b) affects patient and provider satisfaction compared to usual 
        care and (c) reduces cost in relation to benefits compared to usual care; 
        and (d) to investigate the organizational changes that occur when telemedicine 
        is implemented in a medical treatment facility. 
      <p>The general protocol employs a randomized design to compare patient and 
        process outcomes of two methods of consultation (telemedicine and usual 
        care) from a primary care outpatient clinic (at Hickam AFB, HI) to a tertiary 
        care medical center (TRMC). The sample population for this study is active 
        duty and retired military and their dependents requiring consultation 
        from a primary care to a tertiary care facility and their health care 
        providers. For the study, we made the a priori assumption that technology 
        is currently available to transmit diagnostic quality media elements necessary 
        for clinical decision making. We also established &quot;boundaries&quot; 
        which include the following: 
      <p>- Only routine consultations will be evaluated<br>
        - Store and forward technology will be used<br>
        - Focus on population health care delivery<br>
        - Physician to physician consultation<br>
        - Only Dermatology and Orthopedics specialties will be utilized for data 
        collection 
      <p>The Evaluation Study will be conducted in three phases over a two-year 
        period: <br>
        <br>
        Phase I: Infrastructure design, formally known as the Tripler Telemedicine 
        Prototype Project (T2P2) -- In this part of the study, we are designing 
        and building the infrastructure to capture clinical information from a 
        patient at a remote site and electronically transfer this information 
        to TRMC for consultation. Also during this phase, survey instruments and 
        data-gathering procedures will be developed.<br>
        Phase II: Experiment Verification Test (EVT) -- During this phase, a system/procedure 
        simulation at TRMC will take place and instruments/methods refined based 
        on the simulation outcomes.<br>
        Phase III: Experiment/Analysis -- During this phase, data will be gathered 
        over a 90-day period. TRMC Dermatology and Orthopedics Services will be 
        asked to see routine consults from the Hickam Primary Care Clinic. <br>
        <br>
        As of this writing, Phase I is currently in progress. The following describes 
        the background, current status, and plans of the four sub project areas. 
      <p><b><i>Project #1: The Effect of Telemedicine Implementation on Clinical 
        Outcomes in a Limited Military Setting</i> -- Principal Investigator: 
        L.H. Hassell, COL, MC, USA (AMEDD Center and School, TX); Co-Investigators: 
        V. Garshnek, Ph.D. (TRMC, HI); M. Nadeau, LTC, MC, USAF (Hickam AFB, HI); 
        G. Underwood, M.D. (TRMC, HI)</b> 
      <p>Few well-designed studies exist evaluating the influence of telemedicine 
        on health care delivery. In addition, of the few studies existing, it 
        is very difficult to generalize the findings to the military health care 
        system and patient population. Consequently, there is clearly a need for 
        well designed research on (a) outcomes in telemedicine in general and 
        (b) outcomes in telemedicine in the military health care system. The objective 
        of this particular study is to provide a scientific evaluation of clinical 
        outcomes resulting from insertion of telemedicine into a primary care 
        clinic that routinely refers patients to a tertiary medical center for 
        specialty care (specifically, comparing the impact of telemedicine with 
        usual care on key processes and outcome measures). The central hypothesis 
        states that the clinical outcomes of patients are not adversely affected 
        when telemedicine is used as a substitute for usual care in the military 
        health care delivery system. 
      <p>The study uses store and forward telemedicine technology (internet-based), 
        a method that appends textual information about a clinical problem with 
        graphic data files of physical exam findings and diagnostic results. Clinical 
        protocols (consult &quot;worksheets&quot;) have been developed for 12 
        specialty areas. These clinical protocols were developed jointly by Tri-Service 
        primary and specialty physicians on Oahu. Each protocol defines the essential 
        history and physical examination information, lab, and radiograph results, 
        and clinical images required for a consultant to make a remote diagnosis 
        and recommend treatment for a distinct clinical problem. 
      <p>The process envisioned consists of the following: The health care provider 
        accesses the server using an off-the-shelf web browser and selects a clinical 
        consultation protocol to initiate a consult. The server will assemble 
        information from a number of sources on the hospital local area network. 
        This consult will then be &quot;mailed electronically&quot; over the internet 
        to medical specialists for analysis and recommendation. The system will 
        allow the health care provider to choose the time the electronic consult 
        is reviewed. This method overcomes the distinct limitations caused by 
        interactive video systems in the past. Importantly, the remote physician 
        will initiate, and the consultant answer, the consult from their desktop 
        personal computer. We will pilot the server as part of the AKAMAI Evaluation 
        Initiative in 1998. 
      <p><b><i>Project #2: Designing a Satisfaction Tool for Telemedicine Services</i>-- 
        Principal Investigator: S. DeRuvo, LTC, NC, USA (Landstuhl RMC, Germany); 
        Co-Investigator: E. Hill, LTC, NC, USA (TRMC,HI)</b> 
      <p>The purpose of this study is to develop, pilot, and revise as needed, 
        an instrument for evaluating patient and provider satisfaction with the 
        delivery of health care through telemedicine. While there is a great deal 
        of literature related to telemedicine, there are few studies adequately 
        assessing satisfaction of either patient or provider. As this particular 
        study will be conducted as an ongoing project during the initial implementation 
        of telemedicine in the region, feedback from both patients and providers 
        can be used to make changes in the system as it is being developed. In 
        addition, investigators will develop a concept analysis of telemedicine, 
        to be used in future applications related to this study. 
      <p>Initial surveys will be piloted, revised as needed, and then final surveys 
        developed and tested. Once the systems for telemedicine consultation are 
        up and running for at least 2 to 3 months, focus groups evaluating patient 
        and provider satisfaction will be conducted. Prior to this, other focus 
        groups will be conducted off-site to give some initial groundwork and 
        an idea of what should be done in setting up telemedicine at TRMC, as 
        well as some interesting comparisons of how the civilian, mainland systems 
        compare to the system that will be established and used by the military 
        here on Oahu, and later in the Pacific Region. Arrangements are currently 
        underway to conduct the preliminary focus groups. 
      <p><b><i>Project #3: Assessing Organizational Impact of the Implementation 
        of a Telemedicine System </i>-- Principal Investigator: R. Doktor, Ph.D.; 
        Co-Investigator: D. Bangert, Ph.D. (University of Hawaii College of Business 
        Administration) </b> 
      <p>The Organizational Impact study seeks to assess the impact on the organization 
        which occurs as a consequence of the introduction of telemedicine technology, 
        and concomitantly seeks to identify and assess the organizational factors 
        which, if effectively prepositioned, will minimize resistance and maximize 
        acceptance and utilization of telemedicine technology. The study team 
        has chosen to focus upon variables at the individual group and organizational 
        level. Sensitivity analysis will be performed in order to identify variables 
        which have the greatest potential impact in insuring successful implementation 
        of future telemedicine program introductions. Thus far, on the individual 
        level, the research team has identified an inventory which measures cognitive 
        perceptions of the caregivers job characteristics. On the group level, 
        the team has identified the medical decision making process as the variable 
        to be measured and has adopted qualitative research methodology of ethnography 
        as the operative tool. Thus, through observation and interview, the research 
        team will study medical decision making which may occur. On the macro 
        or organizational level, the team has chosen an inventory assessing organizational 
        learning as the measuring instrument and plan to administer it with the 
        same regimen as the job characteristics inventory. The variables measured 
        by the organizational learning inventory, give an indication of changes 
        in the organization's culture as a consequence of the introduction of 
        telemedicine. Currently, the team is finalizing the evaluation instruments 
        and preparing procedures to test these instruments during the EVT phase 
        of this study. 
      <p><b><i>Project #4: Assessing Cost-Effectiveness in a Telemedicine System</i> 
        -- Principal Investigator: E. Mais, Ph.D. (University of Hawaii College 
        of Business Administration)</b> 
      <p>An analysis of the cost-benefit/effectiveness that occurs within a medical 
        care system when new technology is introduced has not been adequately 
        addressed. Virtually no evidence exists concerning the economic viability 
        of telemedicine. Therefore, a strong need exists for concrete, scientific 
        evidence on (a) the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine in general and 
        (b) the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine in the military health care 
        system. The aim of this study is to investigate if telemedicine consultation 
        between medical treatment facilities reduces cost in relation to benefits 
        compared to usual care. The economic analysis of this project will proceed 
        in five parts. Part 1 will identify the important and relevant costs and 
        consequences for the two alternatives specified (telemedicine vs. usual 
        care). Part 2 will accurately measure the identified costs and consequences 
        in appropriate physical units. Part 3 will value the measured costs and 
        consequences in a credible and valid manner. Part 4 will comprise a sensitivity 
        analysis of the costs and consequences. Part 5 will present the results 
        using decision indices that will summarize the findings of the study. 
        The point of view will be that of the patient and the health care provider 
        and will include both direct and indirect costs and consequences. The 
        analysis will follow closely the research design of Project 1 (Clinical 
        Outcomes) so as to appropriately capture the economic differences between 
        consultation to a tertiary care medical center by telemedicine technology 
        versus usual care. Currently, refinement of an initial cost/benefit model 
        is underway based on a high-level process flow diagram for the telemedicine 
        consults and will continue refinement through the EVT phase. 
      <p align="CENTER"><b>Summary/Conclusion</b> 
      <p>This paper addresses the background, development, and status of the AKAMAI 
        Telemedicine Evaluation pilot study. Currently the study is in the first 
        phase of activity, concentrating on development of infrastructure, procedures, 
        and instruments. It is our sincere hope that our methodology and final 
        results will be of value and applicable to other telemedicine research 
        activities in the future.
