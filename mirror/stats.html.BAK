<B>Subpoena Stats</B><BR>
One 2703d Subpoena has been delivered under seal. It requested information
on two individuals. Apparently the FBI thought it easier than delivering 
two seperate subpoenas. The previously listed "pending" subpoena was never
delivered.

<A NAME="NOTES"></A>
<P>
Notes:

<P>
It goes without saying that Attrition does not get every defacement that
is reported to us, that not all defacements are reported to us, and that
these statistics refer only to our archive.

<P>
All of the tallies, graphs, tables, and etc., count each
<A HREF="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/notes.html#mass">
"Mass Hack"</A> as one defacement unless otherwise stated.

<P>
These statistics are prepared with a combination of Perl and a commercial
statistics package, <A HREF="http://www.stata.com">Stata</A>.  All graphics
are from Stata.

<P>
Discrepancies: Yes.  The <A HREF="os.html">easiest</A> discrepancy to find is
between total defacements and adding up the totals for each month.  On one 
hand, a total and accurate count of the entire archive is desired, on the other,
when we do date-based calculations or tallies, we kick out incomplete dates.
Since we have a number of mirrors that don't have a complete date, the date-based
calculations and the total count differ.  Most of the incomplete dates are from
or before early 1999.

<P>
Comments on the graphs:<BR>
We have gradually included more graphs, and more recently (July 2000) some of
<A HREF="graphs/bar_ostotals.gif">these</A> have been specifially designed to
clarify some of the previous graphs.  In some of the claims being made about
these graphs, the moving average of percent of Operating System share
<A HREF="graphs/pct_all_small_29mav.gif">graphs</A> have been misunderstood
to mean everything from reflecting trends in total defacements to Attrition's
advocacy of certain Operating Systems for security purposes.  As an antidote,
consider the recent statistics for *BSD:  A glance at the moving average graph
for the <A HREF="os-graphs.html#BSD">June 2000</A> period might lead one to 
believe that the <B>total</B> defacements for *BSD has increased over the period
of June.  But such is not the case, as a glance at the monthly 
<A HREF="graphs/bar_ostotals.gif">totals</A> graphs and the Operating System
monthly <A HREF="os.html">tables</A> demonstrates: *BSD defacements actually
fell between May and June from 37 to 24.  That said, *BSD's relative share
did increase due to larger relative decreases in other Operating System shares, 
which is reflected in the moving average graph.  All said, the moving average
graphs are very useful so long as we understand what they actually reflect.
