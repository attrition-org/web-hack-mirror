For those of you emailing me to tell me the boxen that i rooted hasnt been secured - thank you- but im aware of this. If youd like to take the time to secure some shitty korean solaris box go for it. If not then take the box - im done with it. To you other groups who think its dumb I do 90 percent solaris - at least I dont do NT. homos.
