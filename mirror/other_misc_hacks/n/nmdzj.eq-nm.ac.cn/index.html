Thanks to everyone for your interesting emails - I appreciate all the intelligent comments, questions and suggestions. One thing I keep getting asked is why Im sticking to the orient. If you browse my defacings on alldas or attrition youll pick up on why. Again I want to point out that I dont think defacing is hacking, nor do I think it commands respect or envy - its just something fun to goof around with.
