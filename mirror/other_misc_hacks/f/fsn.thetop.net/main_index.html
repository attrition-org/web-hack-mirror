<h2>Don't be confused, we are the first Fantasy SportsNET!</H2>
We here at Fantasy SportsNET are worried that you might be confused by 
the name of a new website on the web.  Be assured, we were the first 
Fantasy SportsNET on the web, and if you see our name anywhere else, they aren't 
affiliated with us.
<P>
We asked you for you help in letting this company know you were confused and 
you felt it was unfair, and you have succeeded as we have been
contacted by the lawyers of this company. You are making a difference!  <A 
HREF="lawyer.html">Read what their lawyers had to say.</A>  You can still <A HREF="help.html">
help out</A> as we fight through legal channels
to win the rights to be the ONLY FSN on the web!  Or, you can 
<A HREF="mailto:bravado69@aol.com">send an email to the CEO
of this other company</A> if you would like to give him your opinion.
