<A NAME="leagues">
<H3>I. Leagues</H3>
Leagues will consist of 10 teams.  Each league will have two divisions 
(East and West). 
<A 
NAME="cost"> <H3>II. Cost</H3>
This league is open by invitation only! There is no cost for a team to 
those who were invited!
<A NAME="scoring">
<H3>III. Scoring Method</H3>
You will fight "head to head" against your foe for a week.  The week 
begins on Monday and finishes on Sunday.  
Scoring will be as follows: <P>
<B>Batters</B><BR>
1B + 2B * 2 + 3B * 3 + HR * 4 + RBI + RUN + SB * 2 +BB - E - SO
<P>
<B>Pitchers</B><BR>
IP - ER + SO + W * 5 + SV * 3 - L * 3
<P>
For pitchers who start one game during the week, their fantasy points
per game (FPPG) count toward your total score for the week.  For the rest
of the team (batters and relievers) the total fantasy points (TFP) for your starters for the week will count towards your total score.
Only your starters will count toward your total points for the week. 
That is, your 8 position batters and one DH (of any position) plus your
6 pitchers.  Your starting pitchers can be relievers or starters, there
is no difference.<P>
In the case that one of your starters in certain positions
score 0 TFP, they will be replaced by an <A HREF="#alternates">alternate</A>
<BR>
<BR> 
<A NAME="draft"> <H3>IV. Draft<BR></H3>
The draft will be held at TBD at 
http://fsn.thetop.net/draft.
<P>
<A NAME="live">
<P>
<H4>a. Live Draft</H4><BR>
The live draft  will occur at the time specified.  It will be conducted 
via a special <A 
HREF="http://fsn.thetop.net/draft">draft 
page via Netscape</A>.  You must be present at the URL page at 
the time of the draft and for the duration of the draft.  There are no 
exceptions!!  If you do not show up for the draft your team will be 
forfeited.  You will be given 3 minutes to make each 
selection.  Drafting 
will be done in the format 1-10,10-1 for each two rounds.  
More information on players that must be drafted, will be announced.
<HREF="#rosters">rosters</A> for more information on what your roster may 
be like after the draft. 
<A NAME="rosters">
<H3>V. Roster</H3>
Rosters will be set to 20 players.  You can pick up free agents and make 
trades. You can place a player on DL if they are listed on the injury page
(on your team page) as being on the 15 or 60 day DL.  As soon as the palyer 
comes off the DL you must drop any one player from your roster to make it 
legal.
<BR>
<A NAME="maxsize">
<H4>a. Roster Size</H4>
Your team will never exceed 20 players, not including those on the DL.  These players can be of any 
position, but you must have at least one of every position.
(min 6 pitchers, max 10 pitchers)
<A NAME="starters">
<H4>b. Starters</H4>
You must start a 1B, 2B, 3B, SS, C, 3 OF, and 6 pitchers (starting pitchers 
or relief pitchers)
<P>
<A NAME="alternates">
<H4>c. Alternates</H4>
Each week you must choose at least 3 alternates for your starters.  Alternates 
will be a Corners Alternate who can replace your 1B or 3B positions (alternate must
be a 3B or 1B), a
Middle Alternate who can replace your 2B and SS positions (alternate must
be a 2B or SS) and an OF Alternate.  The batting alternates 
are required.  You may also have a Starting Pitcher and Relief
Pitcher alternate if you wish to have one.
<P>

<A NAME="free_agents">
<H4>d. Free Agent</H4>
Free agents will be made available immediately following the draft.  All 
free agent moves are first come first serve.
You can pick up free agents using the <A 
HREF="leagues/UFBA/fa/C.html">rankings list</A> for your
league.  
Each league will have their own rankings list.  Go to your league page 
and click on "Rankings and Free Agents".  A player with a 
"checkbox" next to his 
name is a free agent.  You can request to pick up this player using the 
automated form. Just enter your password at the bottom of the page and 
check those free agents you wish to take.  This will write out to a 
transaction file, and your moves will be evaluated prior to making them 
official.  You must drop a player from your roster before you pick up 
another player if your roster is full with 20 players.

<A NAME="trades">
<H4>VI. Trades</H4>
Trades can be made at anytime by anyone with any other team.  A trade 
must be sent via the <A HREF="leagues/UFBA/transact.html">email form</A> 
listed on the team pages by BOTH teams.  A trade is not official until 
the commish recieves the form <B>from both</B> teams.

<A NAME="complaints">
<H4>a. Trade Complaints</H4>
A trade complaint occurs when a team feels that a trade that has been
completed is not good for the league and is extremely unfair.  Realize,
that this does not mean that the trade was good or bad for one team or
the other, but that the trade is so unfair that it makes the league less
competitive.  (This is mainly to keep two friends from stacking one team by
trading Shaq for Charlie Ward, etc.)
<P>
The process for a trade complaint is as follows:
<P>
1) Usually, as the commish, I will decide, when the complaint comes in,
if it is worthy of a vote to the league.  I may feel that the trade is
fair and will not put it to a vote, or I might move to step 2.  A
complaint must be registered within 48 hours of the completion of the
trade.  If my team is involved in the complaint we will move directly to
step 2.
<P>
2) A preliminary vote will occur here.  If 4/8 of the teams that
weren't involved in the trade feel the trade hurts the league, we will
move to step 3, otherwise the complaint is void.  Once the issue is put
to vote, the league has until Midnight that night to vote on the issue.
Only a negative (or vote that the trade is unfair) is needed, otherwise
just don't vote.  
<P>
3) If 4/8 teams see the trade as unfair there will be a defense for
each team.  First the team that challenged the bid will write a reason
for the complaint and send it to the league.  Then, one or both of the
teams involved in the trade will make their defense.
<P>                                                             
4) Final vote - The last step is a final vote.  5/8 teams must vote
for the trade to be nullified for it to occur.
<P>                                                
<A NAME="schedule">
<H4>VII. Schedule</H4>

the regular season.  Each team will play each team in their division three times
and play each team in the other division twice.  Weeks 23-25 will be 
reserved for a playoff.
