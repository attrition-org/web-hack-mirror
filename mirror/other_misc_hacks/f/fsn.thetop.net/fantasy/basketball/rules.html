Only your five starters count towards your final score.  Each week you 
will also select a Frontcourt Alternate (must be F or C) and a Backcourt 
Alternate (must be G).  If 
one of your starters scores 0 TFP for the week, he will be replaced by 
one of these alternates.  The most alternates you can have replace a 
player during the week is one G and one F or C. 
Your total score will be calculated by Offensive Fantasy Points PER GAME 
minus your opponents Defensive Fantasy Points per game.  Then the 
difference in average turnovers will be taken from the team with MORE turnovers 
score. (for example, if after calculating offensive-defensive points the 
score is 
Team A: 100 to Team B: 105, but the Team A has averaged 15 turnovers for the 
week and 
the Team B has averaged 21 turnovers, the final score is now Team A: 100 to 
Team B: 99<P> 
<BR>
<BR>

<P>

<A NAME="free_agents">
<H4>e. Free Agent</H4>
Free agents will be made available immediately following the draft.  All 
free agent moves are first come first serve.
You can pick up free agents using the <A 
HREF="leagues/UFBA/fa/PG.php">rankings list</A> for your
league.  
Each league will have their own rankings list.  Go to your league page 
and click on "Rankings and Free Agents".  A player with a 
"checkbox" next to his 
name is a free agent.  You can request to pick up this player using the 
automated form, just enter your password at the bottom of the page and 
check those free agents you wish to take.  This will write out to a 
transaction file, and your moves will be evaluated prior to making them 
official.  You must drop a player from your roster before you pick up 
another player if your roster is full with 12 players.

<A NAME="trades">
<H4>VI. Trades</H4>
Trades can be made at anytime before the trade deadline by anyone with any other team.  A trade 
must be sent via the <A HREF="leagues/UFBA/transact.html">email form</A> 
listed on the team pages by BOTH teams.  A trade is not official until 
the commish recieves the form from both teams.  The trade deadline with be the Sunday after the NBA Trade deadline passes.  (For 2001 - Week 17)

<A NAME="complaints">
<H4>a. Trade Complaints</H4>
A trade complaint occurs when a team feels that a trade that has been
completed is not good for the league and is extremely unfair.  Realize,
that this does not mean that the trade was good or bad for one team or
the other, but that the trade is so unfair that it makes the league less
competitive.  (This is mainly to keep two friends from stacking one team by
trading Shaq for Charlie Ward, etc.)
<P> If one team complains that the trade is unfair we will hold a league wide
vote on the fairness of the trade.   5/8 teams including the commishioner, must vote for the trade to be nullified in order for it to occur.
<P>                                                
<A NAME="schedule">
<H4>VII. Schedule</H4>

the regular season. 
You will play each team in the league twice in the regular season, 
and three teams in your division you will play three times.
