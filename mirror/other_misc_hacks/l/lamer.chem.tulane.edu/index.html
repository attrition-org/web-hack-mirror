Let me start off by saying that I don't normally deface shit. I never 

have found a reason to do it, but lately fearsome has been putting in 

so many pages, I had to join in. I also wanted to address something he 

placed in a recent defacement; judging other hackers based upon their 

actions. He was saying we shouldn't look down on someone who defaces or 

someone who packets. I think this is correct, but only to a degree. We 

need seperate forms of judgement least all things would be out of 

balance. If someone did not shame a packet kid or a defacer there might 

be too many of them. There has to be someone to keep the various groups 

from becoming too powerful and fucking shit up when it shouldn't be. 

That being said, I defaced this for one simple reason; I can. I didn't 

really have much to say and I could have just as well not done it. I 

did, however.
