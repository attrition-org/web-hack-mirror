    SuperStore Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) Request Center has a new toll-free telephone
    number and e-mail address. A Material Safety Data Sheet provides workers and emergency
    personnel with the proper procedures for handling or working with a particular substance.
    MSDS will include information such as physical data (melting point, boiling point, flash
    point etc.), toxicity, health effects, first aid, reactivity, storage, disposal,
    protective equipment, and spill/leak procedures. These are of particular use if a spill or
    other accident occurs. Customers can request any GSA MSDS by calling toll-free:
    866-588-7659, or (816) 926-5097, or by sending an e-mail to MSDS@gsa.gov.<span

    return fax number, and/or e-mail, along with the National Stock Number, manufacturer,
