tell you what - i will quit defacing it when they start securing it. ive got no issues with defacing a low level domain in korea - to a big domain in the US. its just a website to me. if all you fucking oriental high tech fellows are supposed to be so smart - try going to packetstorm.securify.com and reading about rpc vuln issues with solaris. untill you do your boxen will be mine thanks to my dot slash solaris hacks.
