<p><strong>I have a fellow family member that has cancer. This deface is for the people
that can't afford the bills that the hospital send them. I feel bad for the families that
can't come up with the money for the treatments. Prices of today's medicine is
outrageously over priced. What I want to know is how is someone that does not have the health
care? Are they just going to see there loved one die of slow death or suffer the pain of
the sickness they may have? I think that is not humain. </strong></p>
