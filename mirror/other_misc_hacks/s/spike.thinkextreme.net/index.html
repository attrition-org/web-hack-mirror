<br><br><br>:: Peace to::<br> NiTR8, BioWin, TheGrimPhreaker, MrsPara,
crispexi, shz, Internexus, deface, h4x0r3d (all the peeps/groups
associated with any member related to #hackfest), grapenut, geebs,
zillion (safemode.org / zillion is also now the new founder of #hacker_help,
we're asking for all the original members to come back, and anybody
interested in helping the channel grow to visit), rm-rf, Ana|og, Edgemaster,
Salv (trying to keep your nick private), everybody from the old h-h chan
(don't give up), defaced.alldas.de, attrition, the group members of
r00t-access, devilSoul, pr0phet <-- none of you guys really know me, but your
friends with my friends, so lets be friends? And the peeps in the Quit Crew
chan and family as we consider it.</font></p> <h3>Now for my message:</h3><br>
<h3>To the admin: Don't feel ashamed about your page being defaced.  I D-MaTz
have returned to this underground world, and choosed your page for my
messages.  In reality, consider this a privillage because if not me,
some asshole with a kids sized brain would have, and done worse.</h3><br>
<h3>To The Viewers:<h3> <b3> <h3>Although I gave Quit Crew the name, it was
NiTR8 that brought us all together.  I say this because NiTR8 is bored. 
Because of this, he has decided to stop defacing.  Farewell from the defacing
world my friend; it shall miss you.  If anybody enjoyed NiTR8's defacements,
please show your appriciation in your next defacement.<h3> <b3> To Defacers:
<h3> <br>I am very very disapointed in you all.  I came back to the internet
after four months, to find this shit?  You might be wondering what I am
refering to.  I looked at all of your defaces, and it made me sick.  All of
you are giving a bad example by talking like 7h3z or any other way other than
plain english or your native language.  Please, for the sake of us all, stop
acting like a bunch of kids.  If your going to deface a webpage, make it worth
it, make it count.  Don't turn a beautiful art into a kiddy thing.  None of
you who flame or talk in 37737 terms are any better than those you flame. 
Stop yelling at the unicode defacers, they are starting small just like all of
us have.  Unicode Defacers, it is time to move up to something else.  If you
need the help, just ask.  That is what all of us are here for, right?  To help
each other. <h3> <b3> <b3><h3> We're just one big happy dysfunctional
family.</h3><br> <h3>Quit Crew : we put the 'pHUN' in dysfunctional.</h3><br>
