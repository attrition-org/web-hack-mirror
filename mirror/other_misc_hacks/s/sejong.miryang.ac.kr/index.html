you know. im sick of hearing about how much smarter orientals are supposed to be than the rest of the world - and thats why im targeting what SHOULD be the most intelligent of the it industry over there -such as technical and computer college admins - and showing everyone how poorly secured your boxs are. and btw everyone - im not securing ANY of them - so figure out solaris and have fun.
