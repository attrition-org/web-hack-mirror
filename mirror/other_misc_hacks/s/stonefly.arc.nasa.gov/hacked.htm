<br><br><p><h4>                 Dear admin,<br>
Your site is insecure. We are not russian spies or anything, so you need not
worry. We are a group of digital security specialists who are out to help secure
the world. No harm has been done to your website. <br>
 <br><br><Br><Br>
We come in logs. We come in chunks. We come in liquids too. But
if you don't tighten up your ass, then here comes the d0odo0 krew. ;)

<h5>We are a group of security breachers. We do this not for profit but for
personal gain and awarness.<h5>
<br>
<h5>You're probably asking yourself, why such a drastic and illegal actions to prove a point?
Well, think of it as a learning process on your behalf. You get a chance to tighten your security, 
and we can possibly fill a hole in our being, or maybe it is just because we 
can. None the less we have no harmful inentions.<h5>  
<br>
<h5>In no way was this motivated to cause you harm or to make you feel 
inferior. We just hope because of this you and your security is stronger 
and your customers are happier.<h5>
