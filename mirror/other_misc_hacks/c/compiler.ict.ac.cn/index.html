<center>"ohhh rook up in duh skries it r a prane! Ohhh its just a sirry american prane, rat mea

ns ree

can shroot it down and kreep it!"

<center>Well kidd-0's it's story time with Uncle Hackweiser. So gather up around your computerscreen

and take your ritalin because you're in for a doozie!

<center> As we last left of our hero, Sammy the spy plane, crashed landed on a remote island in

 china

over international air space and couldn't see his family or friends ever again. Well let's chec

k in

with how sammy is doing today.  It seems like it has been eons since sammy was able to see hisfamily

and he was getting really sad.  The only thing he could do to keep himself from getting sad ismasterbation! Can you say that boys and girls, "Maaaasteeer-baaasshuuun". Good job your doing s

well,

now get your hands out of your pants and listen to my fuckin' story! Well before dawn everydaySammy

would wake up extra super early and squeeze one off and wipe his "wing-ding" on the chineese so

ldiers

over top of his eye. The general was not pleased one bit. He fumed and fussed and cried and carried on

some more and went over to Sammy and said "How all you americans gret such big dring drongs? You no

built like us we all have small lil dring drongs!". This made sammy happy to know that the general had

an inferior ding ding and it evne made Sammy giggle a bit. The general went back to sleep sucking his

thumb muttering these words "stupid american and dere big ding drongs!".

<center>Can you tell me the moral of the story boys and girls?

<center> That's right! I knew you could do it!

<center> The moral of the story is even though the chineese can steal our spy planes and refuse to give

it back, we still have much more superior penises than them!

<center> Ohhh looks like we're out of time kidd-0's, maybe next installment we'll hear if we send

Mr. Nuclee R. Warhead over there to fix the lil' problem and we'll see if they ever are going to let

Sammy go home to his family.

<center> Until next time kidd-0's, this is Uncle Hackweiser signing off, watch the skies for me :).

<center>Now go drink some bleach!
