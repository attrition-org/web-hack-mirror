<FONT SIZE="2"><b>China moves to control internet</b></font></P>
<p align="left">China has passed a law on internet crime, which
provides for a crack down on political dissent, according to state
media reports on Friday. </p>


<p align="left">Any "subversive" activity on the internet is now a
crime</p>
 
<p align="left">Under the new law, passed on Thursday by the National
People's Congress (NPC), China's parliament, subversive activities
over the internet are a crime. </p>

<p align="left">"Using the internet to... incite the overthrow of
state power, topple the socialist system or... destroy national unity"
constituted as crimes, the People's Daily newspaper reported. </p>

<p align="left">Other activities on the internet deemed as crimes are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p align="left"><i>breaking into networks concerned with national
affairs, defence and advanced technology </i></p></li>
<li><p align="left"><i>creating and disseminating computer viruses
</i></p></li>
<li><p align="left"><i>promoting Taiwan's independence </i></p></li>
<li><p align="left"><i>organising "cults" </i></p></li>
<li><p align="left"><i>establishing pornographic websites and
providing links to such websites </i></p></li>
<li><p align="left"><i>spreading rumours to manipulate stock
prices</i> </p></li>
<li><p align="left"><i>tampering with personal e-mails </i></p></li>
</ul>

<p align="left">Several articles of the resolution are similar to
existing laws used to imprison dissidents, ethnic separatists and
members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual group.</p>


<p align="left"><b>Websites gagged </b></p>



<p align="left">Net dissident Lin Hai was the first to be jailed</p>
<p align="left"> The legislation was seen as the latest attempt by the
authorities to control content and use of the internet, which has seen
explosive growth - the number of users doubled in the first eight
months of this year to 16.9 million. </p>

<p align="left">Official task forces have shut down some websites
deemed "subversive" and have previously tried to block access to
foreign websites deemed undesirable - including the BBC, Yahoo! and
CNN. </p>

<p align="left">Websites publishing news currently have to seek
approval from a state information office. </p>



<p align="left">News websites must be approved by the state</p>
 
<p align="left">Last month, China moved to gag dissent in internet
chatrooms, where users have been increasingly bold in their criticism
of government policy. </p>

<p align="left">It launched regulations that made websites responsible
for ensuring that users do not post messages deemed "illegal" - that
is, anything against the constitution or that "harms China's honour
and interests". </p>

<p align="left">China has also detained several people for activities
over the internet. </p>

<p align="left">China's Ministry of Public Security said 1,000
internet crimes were reported in the first six months of this year,
the same number as throughout the whole of 1999.

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1">What we dislike about the situation in China is that the
Chinese government is denying its people the freedom of speech to
which they are entitled too.  Not only this, but they are attempting
to use the internet for their own political advantage by filtering
which sites people are allowed to create within china.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"

on with your daily life, but if you had to live on a day to day basis
with this kind of censorship then you would HAVE to take it
seriously.</font></p>
