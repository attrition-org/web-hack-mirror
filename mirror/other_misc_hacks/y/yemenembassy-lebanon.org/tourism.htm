<HR><IMG SRC="gif/tourism/security.gif"><HR>

<P ALIGN="Justify">During the last two and a half decades, Yemen has been considered a safe country for foreigners to live in . Generally, foreigners are treated with respect and are seen as being here for the benefit of the country. However the economic and political climate has deteriorated during 1993 - 94 and the security situation worsened, but these days the situation is better, and the country has became more stable and secure for all foreigners. Do not worry specially if you are within a tourist group. But if you are in a hired car be careful as some remote roads are not safe and your car might be hijacked, this is the case not only for the foreigners but for any one who is driving luxury car. ·

<HR><IMG SRC="gif/tourism/pets.gif"><HR>

<P ALIGN="Justify">Pets may be brought in if accompanied by a veterinary health certificate and an import permit from the veterinary office in Yemen. Domestic animals common in Yemen are cats, dogs, donkeys, cows, sheep goats and poultry. There is also a long standing tradition of beekeeping ; Yemeni honey is reputedly among the finest in the world and its high price reflects this. Most of it is exported, some to the Gulf states to be used as   medicine, or as  luxury. If you want to buy it, it is better to accompany a Yemeni  who can take you to the best places. Doves are often kept on the roof, and occasionally birds in a cage. Cats and dogs roam wild and feed on garbage . Pet dogs attract the attention of children, but  watchdog are likely to discouragethem.
<P ALIGN="Justify">The National Veterinary Services development program, a project of the UK Overseas Development Agency, offers quality veterinary services, including immunization and surgery, and home visits can be arranged in emergencies.

<HR><IMG SRC="gif/tourism/localhospitality.gif"><HR>

<P ALIGN="Justify">There is mutual curiosity among Yemenis and expatriates to learn about each other’s culture. The quickest way is to invite friends to one’s home . An old Yemeni tradition holds that the one who has shared a meal with you will not be your enemy. Yemenis take great pride in showing generous hospitality to their friends, and in the countryside foreign travelers are often invited to eat and spend the night in Yemeni houses. Arab hospitality is expressed in terms of plentiful food and generous sprinklings of perfume on the departing guests. The family, the family is viewedas the God-willed way of life. A foreign resident’s family therefore is treated with respect, and children in particular attract attention and warmth. Complete strangers may come up to you and kiss your baby or small child - something you can hardly prevent. ·

<HR><IMG SRC="gif/tourism/traveling.gif"><HR>

<P ALIGN="Justify">To appreciate Yemen’s considerable natural beauty, one has to leave the city and explore the countryside . While the main roads are well surfaced and travelling them is a comfortable experience, taking to the rugged mountain tracks in a 4-wheel-drive vehicle is an adventure well worth the effort . The serpentine mountain roads offer breathtaking views into Wadis lined by countless man-made terraces. Visit the barren eastern mountains with their fascinating rock formations and be awed by the encroaching desert’s sand dunes. Dive into the clear waters of the Red Sea or the ndian Ocean or explore the tropical flora and fauna of the lower wadis with their clear monsoon streams and unique settlements and culture. And if you like the off beat, do not miss the experience of crossing the desert "Ramlat Assaba’atyin" on the southern corner of the Rub’a-alkhali, between Marib and Shabwa, the shortest way to the famous Wadi Hadramout. You can follow the ancient Gold and Incense Road along the edge of the desert. In Marib you can visit the old great Marib dam, The Queen of Sheba temple and the remains of ancient civilizations.. To enjoy the varied scenery, explore mysterious historical sites, marvel at the architecture, and most of all meet the people, many of whom maintain their original ways of life, is an unforgettable experience . Wherever you go, children will appear curious, boisterous, and sometimes annoying, you do not need to give them any thing , just small smile and show some good humor and they will love you. ·

<HR><IMG SRC="gif/tourism/photography.gif"><HR>

<P ALIGN="Justify">Men and children (male&female) are willing to have their picture taken , but be more cautious with women. Photographing women, even if veiled , is considered very rude and risky. Also be careful not to photograph military sites, airports or harbors, which are restricted security areas, try not to photograph bad sights of Yemen like garbage ..etc this will create bad feelings toward those who want to reflect bad ideas about the country. Despite the restrictions Yemen is a photographer’s paradise. Some of your shots of traditional activities, like ploughing with the help of a donkey or grinding sesame with a camel, have potential historic value, because the old ways, now still widely observed, are destined to become things of the past.
