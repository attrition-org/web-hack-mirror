<P ALIGN="Justify">The Republic of Yemen is located on the southwest corner of the Arabian Peninsula, between latitudes 12 - 20 north of the equator, and longitudes 14-54 east of Greenwich. The total area is 555,000 sq.km excluding Ar-rub-al-khali (the Empty Quarter) . The Red Sea to the west and the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south make up a 2000km long coastline. Across the Bab al Mandab Strait, Djibouti is the nearest African country and Oman is the neighbor to the east., Saudi Arabia borders Yemen from the north.

<P ALIGN="Justify">The landscape changes dramatically as one moves eastward from the shores of the Red Sea and northward from the Gulf of Aden to the great desert . Five distinct geographical areas with climatic zones ranging from tropical to moderate can be distinguished. 

<A NAME="coastal"></A>
<P ALIGN="Justify"><LI><B>Coastal Area</B>
<UL><P ALIGN="Justify">Called the Tihama, or "hot land" is a desert-like plain 30 to 40 k.m.. wide. Quite fertile when irrigated, dates and cotton grow well here. Reefs protect the coastline and there are many beautiful beaches. A tourist infrastructure, however, has yet to be developed . The most popular are near Khawkha and on the Aden peninsula. The length of the coastal regions is about 2,000 km.</UL>

<A NAME="western"></A>
<P ALIGN="Justify"><LI><B>Western Mountains</B>
<UL><P ALIGN="Justify">These are the most spectacular feature of south Arabia . Rising steeply to 2000 m, they are lined with tens of thousands of intricately-fashioned terrace fields. The terraces are part of an age-old yet highly sophisticated system of water and soil management that enabled an agriculture-based society to flourish in an otherwise hostile environment. Deep wadis (valleys) divide the mountains and discharge the monsoon torrents into the sea. many wadis are lush with papaya, mango and banana groves. The western slopes are the natural habitat of coffee: a crop that started its world career in Yemen, during the 16th century .The terraces are used also to cultivate sorghum, wheat, barley and corn.</UL>

<A NAME="central"></A>
<P ALIGN="Justify"><LI><B>Central Highlands</B>
<UL><P ALIGN="Justify">The central highlands and their large basins, in one of which the capital Sana’a is located at an altitude of 2350 m, boasts the highest mountain on the Arabia Peninsula, Nabi Shu’aib (3650)m) . During the summer, grapes, grain and vegetables grow and fruits are grown and large-scale agriculture is practiced.</UL>

<A NAME="eastern"></A>
<P ALIGN="Justify"><LI><B>Eastern Mountains</B>
<UL><P ALIGN="Justify">Ranging from 1100m to 2300m, the eastern mountains are barren and rugged, and agriculture is carried out mainly in the wadis . Yemen’s ancient civilization developed and flourished here at the edge of the desert . The seasonal rain water was dammed with remarkable technical skill and year-around irrigation systems were developed.</UL>

<A NAME="al-rub"></A>
<P ALIGN="Justify"><LI><B>Ar-rub Al-Khali (the empty quarter)</B>
<UL><P ALIGN="Justify">The Empty Quarter forms part of the desert regions of Yemen. The commonest desert vegetation includes needle plants, such as Kuthib, Zeiza, Mawrer, etc. The seasonal wadis (Oasis) constitute a suitable habitat for animal-rearing and nomadic settlement. Through various historical periods, Ar-Rub Al-Khali was given a number of names, namely Al-Regrag sea, Al Safi Sea, Great Yemeni Desert, Ahkaf desert.</UL>

<P ALIGN="Justify">Climate zones range from tropical on the coastal strip and subtropical in the western and eastern mountains, to moderate in the central mountains and basins. Sana’a in the central highlands; is generally dry and temperatures rarely exceed 30C in summer , while they may fall below zero on winter nights. In Aden the mean daily temperature in summer is 36.6C.and in winter 28.6C. The summer monsoon brings rain that varies considerably from region to region . It permits rain-fed cultivation on the terraces which are part of a sophisticated water management system. In the south west (around Ibb), it rains from February to October and rainfall of up to 1,000 mm/year may be recorded . Other areas enjoy two rainy seasons, in March-April and July-August. Rainfall in Sana’a averages 250mm, decreasing towards the east to 50mm. Aden receives very little rainfall , on average 50mm per year.

<P ALIGN="Justify">The tectonic process which formed the mountains of Yemen and caused immense volcanic activity from the beginning of the neozoic age (some 70 million years ago) continues even today. The Arabian plate which separated from the African continer to form the Red Sea still moves eastward a few centimeters each year. Today, there is no volcanic activity, but the "fires of Yemen" are remembered in history. Hot springs testify to fact that the earth has not completely settled yet. The severest earthquake of this century hit the Dhamar region in 1982, taking 2502 lives and affecting more than 265,000 people in 1072 villages and hamlets. The earliest recorded earthquake was in 742 AD in Sheba land. 25 earthquakes are believed to have occurred since the 8th century . The last earthquake , which measured 4.5 on the Richter scale, occurred in the Udayn region west of Ibb in November 1991, and killed 26 people. In February, 1993, Aden suffered major floods which killed 12 people and caused extensive damage to property and the city’s aging drainage and sewerage systems.
