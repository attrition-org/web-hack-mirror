<P ALIGN="Justify">Salam aleikum-Peace be with you A heartfelt embrance is the natural expression of joy when greeting a close relative or friend in the Arab world . Arab heads of state demonstrate the brotherly ties between their nations by embracing and kissing one another’s cheeks. When two friends meet on the street, they often express exuberant joy that to outsiders may look rather effusive . 
<P ALIGN="Justify">The embracing and kissing is repeated again and again, accompanied by exclamations like Keyf Halak Ya akhi ( how are my brother) and antan bekhir (are you well?) it is not uncommon for people to stop their cars in the midst of dense traffic to greet a friend and start a conversation, until loud honking from all sides compels them to drive on. Formal words of greeting are Salam aleikum (peace be with you) . The answer is wa-aleikum-as-salam. Children say it respectfully to elders, who may return the greeting with a short keyfak (how are you) and stroke their head. Other forms of greeting are Sabah al-kheir (good morning) or Masa’a al-khier (Good evening) which are answered with sabah an-nur or masa an-nur. The handshake is commonly used, especially when meeting foreigners. Some traditionlists may refuse to shake hands with a foreign women. 
<P ALIGN="Justify">Yemeni women may be very reserved when meeting foreign men and might speak to them only from behined the veil.

<HR><IMG SRC="gif/culture/invitations.gif"><HR>

<P ALIGN="Justify">It is important to arrive on time-but do not expect to leave on time . Being invited to a Yemeni’s house for a meal is special event, and your host will do every thing to make it a memorable occasion. To produce a typically sumptuous Yemeni meal, the women of the house must work for hourse . If the host’s is a modern nuclear family , the wife will seek a sister’s or cousin’s help because alone she would be overwhelmed by the task. While the visitor is not expected to bring gifts, a present will be appreciated. 
<P ALIGN="Justify">Gift considred precious or local (baladi) honey, butterfat, coffee or coffee husks, raisins and almonds -commodities often brought along by relatives from the countryside when visiting their families in town. Given the fact that imported equivalents are not considered as valuable , a foreigner could bring a potted plant (newly fashionable) , some perfume (adored by every Arab) or a box of cookies or sweets (not only children’s favorites) . 
<P ALIGN="Justify">On the occasion of births or weddings, a gift may be given as well. However, it will not be opened in your presence , but put aside without much ado. If a Yemeni wants to show his appreciation to a foreigner , he often gives him traditional item such as a brass vase, an incense burner, a water pipe,a Jambia (dagger), or a hand-woven basket . The foreigners may bring in turn a souvenir from his own country when returning from a holiday.

<P ALIGN="Justify">Sitting comfortably in your host’s mafraj (sitting room in the upper floor), you may compliment him on everything you see: his house, the garden, his children. Every Yemeni is proud of his country and loves it dearly. He will be delighted to hear that you like it, too . Keyf al Yemen? (how is Yemen) is a question you will hear many times . Answers like al-Yemen tamam (Yemen is good) or Al-Yemen belad Jamilah jiddan (Yemen is a beautiful country) will be much appreciated .

<P ALIGN="Justify">A plastic cloth or some newspapers are spread on the floor of the dining area and the dishes of food are shared between the diners . In the house of a modern, wealthier family you may be seated at a table and eat from individual plates, but the feeling of closeness is stronger in the original way. The meal starts with bismillah (in the name of Allah) and is eaten quickly with one’s right hand and with great appettite . Bread is always baked fresh in the tannur oven and served hot. The bread is used as a kinds of boileds or roasted meats like mutton, beef and chicken .Fried fish, rice, vegetables and salads are ften served before the meat to quell the first hunger pangs. Fish is prepared in many special ways and some spicy dishes are like Indian dishes, Pork is strictly forbidden for Muslims. A typical Yemeni dish is hulbah and its variant seltah, a steaming sauce made of ground fenugreek, leek and spices, served in the same stone dish in which it is prepared.

<HR><IMG SRC="gif/culture/births.gif"><HR>

<P ALIGN="Justify">The three main events in a person’s life - Birth, Wedding, Death - are celebrated in special ways. After the birth of a child, the mother has a period of rest for 40 days, when all household chores are done by the other women of house. The mother receives female visitors every afternoon and sits on an elvated bed clad in specially beautiful clothes . A religious celebration, mawlid, is often held during this period, and the 40th day is celebrated with a great number of friends crowding the diwan (room for special festivities) . Boys are usually circumcised on the 7th day, a happy occasion for the father who slaughters a sheep and invites his friends . Female circumcision is not practiced except in certain parts of the Tihama. Birthday are not celebrated. 
<P ALIGN="Justify">Marriage is the next important event in person’s life . In villages, the boy’s mother begins by looking for a suitable wife for her son, and once a family has been identified , the marriage is negotiated by the father. Due to strict segregation between the sexes and the practice of veiling , men are unable to find their own brides . Only in big cities are young people left to choose their own mates. Early marriage is still common, but among the educated elite the trend is to marry in one’s twenties after completing one’s education. the marriage contract is concluded between the father of the bride and bridegroom in the presence of Al qadi (judge). The pride should pay Almahr (amount of money), the girl receives a substantial share in the form of gold, dresses, materials and other valuables . A typical wedding celebration lasts three days and often involves over 200 guests. Men and women celebrate separately in different houses . The nengather in the bridegroom’s house to share a big meal , chew qat and listen to an o’ud (lute) player and singer. In the evening they join together in the street which is decorated by many coloured lamps suspended between the houses . A musician playing the mizmar ( an oboe-like instrument) entertains the guests, and religious and tribal songs are sung. Jambia dances are performed to the rhythem of drums. The bride celebrates in her parents’ house or special wedding palace" together with a great number of female friends and relatives . 
<P ALIGN="Justify">On different days she wears the traditional wedding costume and a white Western wedding dress. A female singer and lutist may entertain the guests, or Western disco. Arabic belly-dance music may be played and the guests invited to dance . 
<P ALIGN="Justify">On the wedding night, the bride is brought by her father and other relatives to the groom’s house to meet her future husband , From the moment she croses the doorstep she belongs to the house of the husband . Burials commonly take place on the very day a person dies. The deceased is covered with a richly embroidered blanket . After a prayer in the mosque, he is carried by four men on a bier to the graveyard , accompanied by male relatives and friends singing religious songs . Grave stones with inscriptions are more commonly erected in the south, while a typical graveyard in the north is nothing more than a collection of large stones After the burial, the family gathers for a meal to share remembrance of the dear person who left them.
