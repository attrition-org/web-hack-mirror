This is a rant about Napster and the assholes responsible for fucking it up.
<p> 
<p> 
Theres been enough bitching and moaning about the bullshit going on with napster. Im so tired of our countries monuments to consumerism opposing one of the very ideas this country was founed on - freedom. Napster is one of - if not THE greatest things to be birthed into the internet in years. Do the idiots responsible for the ridiculous restrictions put on Napster think it will get them somewhere with their fans? If so we have a message for you.

We had a way to sample your music and make educated decisions on whether or not we wanted to buy your ridiculously priced CDs - now you can suck our collective dick. Your fans liked the options they had with Napster you fucking materialistic bastards. Quit whining about making 1 million bucks a year instead of 2 and pay attention to your fans.
