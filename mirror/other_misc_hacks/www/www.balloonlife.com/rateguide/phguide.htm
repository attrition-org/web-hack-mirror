</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
BALLOON LIFE is a 4-color monthly magazine dedicated to the sport of hot
air ballooning. Only photographs of the highest quality are considered.
Photos should be of sharp exposure, good contrast and with excellent color
saturation. The use of photos in the magazine is editorially driven; all
photos, including the cover, must relate directly to inside editorial.<BR>
<BR>
Submissions should be 35mm color transparencies. Color or black &amp; white
prints may also be acceptable. All photographs should be originals. (Duplicate
transparencies will be considered but should be so identified.) Copyright
must rest with photographer or written permission must be secured from third-party
owners. Captions and model releases are preferred.Unless specific written
assignment is made, all photos are accepted on a speculation basis only.
<B><I>Photographs will not be returned unless accompanied by a self-addressed,
stamped envelope. </I></B>The photographer generally will be notified within
two weeks to confirm receipt of submissions. Simultaneous submissions and
previously published work is okay. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Stock Needs:</B> BALLOON LIFE rarely buys stock photography. As mentioned
above, the magazine is editorially driven. Occasionally we are interested
in &quot;stock subjects&quot; such as winter flying, mountain flying, commercial
balloons, special shape balloons, etc. Photographers should query first
for information on these anticipated needs. Please include an indication
of the contents of your files. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Event Coverage:</B> BALLOON LIFE targets a variety of balloon events
for coverage each year and freelance photographs are often used with these
articles. Photo coverage should include not only balloons, but other shots
which help the reader to capture the true spirit of the event. For example,
celebrities, scenics (with and without balloons) faces in the crowd, related
events (arts &amp; crafts fairs, chili cook-offs, polo games), etc. Photographers
are welcome to query the magazine for interest if they will be attending
an upcoming balloon event.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Assignments:</B> Occasionally assignments are made to shoot either specific
events, flights, or subjects. In these cases, BALLOON LIFE will provide
the photographer with specific direction, contacts and other assistance.
Assignment rates are negotiable.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Rates:</B> BALLOON LIFE buys first North American serial rights. Payment
schedule is $50 for the cover and $15 for inside color or B&amp;W. Photos
are returned and payment is made upon publication. <BR>
