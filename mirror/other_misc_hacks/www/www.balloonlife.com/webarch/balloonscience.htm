<B>Introduction:</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This report is designed to answer a number of frequently
asked questions about ballooning, provide some additional resources for
information, ask some thought provoking questions, and otherwise supply
some ideas about how to make a science project out of aerostation.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Suggested books:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;Ballooning, The Complete Guide to Riding
the Winds&quot; by Dick Wirth, ISBN 0-934-51338-X published by Random House.
The book was originally published in 1980 in hardback. In 1990 it was reissued
with a soft cover and 16 pages were updated. Both versions are basically
the same, and the information is a little old. Still, the book is the best
general reference that you can use for explaining the various aspects of
ballooning. It is an excellent general introduction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;The Aeronauts&quot; by Donald Jackson, ISBN
0-8094-3268-8. This book is more a history book and is part of the Time/Life
&quot;Epic of Flight&quot; series on aviation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;The Eagle Aloft&quot; by Tom Crouch, ISBN
0-87474-346-X published by The Smithsonian Institution. This is a 200 year
history of the balloon in America. If you want US history of ballooning
this is the book.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;Hot Air Balloons&quot; by Christine Kalakuka
and Brent Stockwell, ISBN 1-56799-620-5, published by Friedman/Fairfax in
1998. This is a modern up to date coffee table style book on the sport of
ballooning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;The Pre-Astronauts&quot; by Craig Ryan, ISBN
1-55750-732-5, published by The Naval Institute Press.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
<B>Questions and Answers about Hot Air Balloons</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">What are hot air balloons made of?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The bag-or envelope, as it's more properly called-is
made of a reinforced fabric called rip-stop nylon (some balloons are made
of dacron). The material is very light weight, but is very strong. The fabric
is coated on the inside to prevent leaks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
How is it inflated?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">During the inflation process, ballooning becomes
a group sport. Since a balloon is quite unwieldy on the ground, especially
in gusty winds, it takes about four people to get the balloon inflated.
Of course, the more people there are, the more fun you can have. To start
off, the envelope is stretched out on the ground and attached to the basket,
which is lying on its side. A small gasoline-powered fan blows air into
the balloon. Then the burner is turned on, and the air in the balloon is
heated. The hot air rises, lifting the balloon upright.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
What are the baskets made of?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The baskets are made from rattan or wicker and
each one is individually woven by hand.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
How big are hot air balloons?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The typical sport balloons range in size from 65,000
to 105,000 cubic feet in volume and stand around 70 feet tall.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
How do you steer the thing?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Strictly speaking you don't. The balloon goes where
the wind takes it. However, the winds at varying altitudes may blow in different
directions and at different speeds, so the trick is to climb or descend
to an altitude where the wind is blowing in the direction you want to go.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
How fast does it go?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As fast as the wind. Or as slow. Since the balloon
has no forward propulsion system, its speed is determined entirely by the
speed of the wind. That's why balloon races are events of accuracy not speed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
When is the best time to fly a balloon?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Usually just after sunrise and one or two hours
before sunset. This is the time of day when winds are calmest and the air
most stable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
How high do balloons fly?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Most balloon flights occur between 500 and 1,000
feet above the ground. But balloons can fly at treetop level or go much
higher. The world record for altitude in a hot air balloon is 65,000 feet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
How long can it stay up?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It depends. Normally, the balloon carries enough
fuel to remain aloft for 2 hours, but factors like outside air temperature,
weight being carried in the basket, and weather determine the duration of
the flight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
What kind of fuel is used?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Propane, kept in pressurized tanks on the floor
of the basket. The balloon carries 30-40 gallons of liquid propane. It is
carried under pressure and passes to the burners through flexible hoses.
When the valves are opened, the propane atomizes and is ignited by a pilot
light in the burners. The flame may shoot out as much as ten or twenty feet,
making a loud &quot;whoosh.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
How do you get it back?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">With the help of friends who drive a van or pickup
truck. This chase crew follows the flight of the balloon (as well as the
existing roads allow) and should be on hand to make the recovery when the
balloon touches down.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
What is the difference between a gas balloon and a hot air balloon?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A gas balloon is completely enclosed and is filled
with helium or hydrogen. A hot air balloon gets its lift from heating the
air within it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
Do you need a license to pilot a balloon?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Yes. A Balloon Pilot Certificate is issued by the
Federal Aviation Administration. You must pass an FAA written examination,
obtain a prescribed number of hours in a balloon, make a solo flight and
a flight to altitude, pass a flight test and submit a medical statement.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Brief History of Balloon Flight</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The first recorded balloon flight occurred in France
in June 1783 when two brothers, Jacques Etienne and Joseph Michel Montgolfier,
sent a large, smoked-filled bag 35 feet into the air. Three months later,
a duck, rooster and sheep became the first passengers in a balloon, since
no one knew whether a human could survive the flight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
Finally on November 21, 1783, before a vast throng of on-lookers that included
the King and Queen of France, Marquis d'Arlandes and Pilatre de Rozier piloted
man's first aerial voyagemore than a century before the Wright brothers'
historic flight at Kitty Hawk!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
Ballooning became quite popular for over half a century in Europe. Ten days
after the first manned hot air flight, a French physicist named J.A.C. Charles
made the first manned flight in a hydrogen-filled balloon. Eighteenth century
farmers, frightened by these strange objects descending from the heavens,
attacked the balloon with pitchforks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
With the advent of powered aircraft, ballooning became a less practical
mode of flight, practiced by only a few enthusiasts. The modern day sport
of hot air ballooning evolved through research for the U.S. Navy in the
1960's and has enjoyed a remarkable comeback due to the development of a
durable, inexpensive nylon for the envelope in combination with an improved
and efficient propane burner system. Today there are more than 5,000 balloon
pilots in the U.S. alone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Suggestions for getting started on a science
project using ballooning as a theme:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">What are the basic principles of physics apply
to hot air ballooning?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Build a &quot;trash bag&quot; or &quot;tissue paper&quot;
hot air balloon to demonstrate the science of lighter-than-air flight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Demonstrate &quot;Boyle's Law of Gasses.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Discuss Archimede's Principle of Buoyancy Force.
The greater the difference of temperature between the air inside the envelope
(the balloon) and the air outside - the greater the lifting capacity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Discuss weights and balances.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mathematical calculations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Venturi Effect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Discuss the effect of weather on balloons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Effects of the jet stream in relation to the recent
around-the-world by balloon attempts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Since geometry is a really basic field of science,
go through the system of projections to develop the shape of a balloon.
Start with a simple sphere. Then do a sphere on cone. Then approximate the
&quot;Natural Shape&quot; balloon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">To do a simple natural shape, there are lots of
sources for computer programs such as the LTA Builders groups and the CD
ROM (Balloons! IBM compatiable, http://kumo.swcp.com/balloons/) by Ojo Magic.
Make a tailored balloon to the computer program and then make a plain cylinder
with the same gore length and excess material circumferentially. Inflate
them side by side to show they end up the same shape! (The plain cylinder
will have a lot of wrinkles, but the same silhouette.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">An analysis of the radius of curvature at any elevation
showing that it is directly related to the internal pressure at that point
and the vertical load there (total payload divided by the circumference
at that point) will likely blow away his comment that everyone knows how
they work, as most high school science teachers I have met would not know.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Try a &quot;Solar&quot; hot air balloon made of
black tissue paper, inflated by a very small fan (like from a computer ventilation
system) and buoyed up by infra red heat lamps. If it does not rise, that
may be all the better because then you can theorize on why it doesn't rise
and your electric toaster supported hot air balloon does. This shows that
a &quot;Scientific Experiment&quot; is a success if the results are properly
observed, especially when they are different from the hoped for results.
The scientist will be able to explain why one works and the other didn't
and propose modifications to make it work (Bigger balloon, lighter tissue
paper, and more radiant heat - maybe with parabolic reflectors so the lamps
can be farther away and so there is room for more of them.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Make a model balloon that is filled with plain
air, but is submerged in an aquarium. (Tissue paper won't work for that
one.) Measure the lift as compared to the bigger hot air one. Call that
unit of the project &quot;Eureka&quot;. Why? Who was Archimedes? What was
the difference between Archimedes and Montgolfier? What was the difference
between the Stratosphere Balloon and the Bathyscaph? Which one was invented
first and which one was an adaptation of the other?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Validate the balloon project as an important scientific
venue by citing Craig Ryan's book &quot;The Pre-Astronauts,&quot; The Naval
Institute Press, ISBN 1-55750-732-5.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Tape a couple of telephone interviews with college
physics professors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Make a video of an actual hot air balloon flight,
especially showing the inertia, momentum and heat loss reactions not easily
demonstrated indoors.</FONT></P>
