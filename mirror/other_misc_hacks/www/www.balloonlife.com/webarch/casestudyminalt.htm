<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>A Case Study in How the FAA and NTSB View Low Balloon Flying</H1>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>by Tom Hamilton</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Editor, Balloon Life</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR></P>

<P>Between June 1995 and May 1996 <I>Balloon Life </I>published five articles
that followed one case where a pilot was cited by the Federal Aviation Administration
for flying to low over a city and landing in an inappropriate place. The
case was heard by an Administrative Law Judge and then appealed by both
parties to the National Transportation Safety Board.</P>

<P>The links below are to the five stories. In the final story, &quot;Choose
Your Landing Site Carefully,&quot; the NTSB clearly lays out its feeling
about low flying and a balloon pilot's choice of a landing site.</P>

<P>This case study is presented to provide insight into the thinking by
the NTSB. Pilot's may wish to consider these thoughts in their own flight
planning, landing site selection, and to the thought process used by the
FAA Adminstrator and field representatives.</P>

<P>This article looks at the original case, Adminstrator vs. Prior, as heard
by the ALJ. The judge vacates most of the penalty sought by the FAA against
the defendant. <A HREF="/webarch/safealt.htm"><I>Minimum Safe Altitude Rewritten?</I>,

the initial hearing in Adminstrator vs. Prior mentioned above. <A HREF=

<P>Introduction to a petition made to the FAA in 1996 requesting that the
minimum altitude for balloons as contained in FAR 91.119 be lowered.<A

<P>Why the FAA denied a petition to lower the minimum safe altitudes in
1991. <A HREF="/webarch/petition.htm"><I>Petition Denied</I>, May 1996</A></P>

<P>The NTSB in its strongest wording to date reiterates its position on
minimum safe altitudes and inappropriate landing sites.<A HREF="/webarch/choose.htm"><I>Choose
