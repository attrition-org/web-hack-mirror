Balloon Life is the only monthly color magazine for the sport of hot air ballooning. Every month Balloon Life explores the fascinating life of ballooning. Our reporting is clear and concise, often going behind the scenes to bring you the insider's view of our sport.<p>

Lively features, accented by stunning color photography, bring you the passion that is ballooning, whether your interest is that of a pilot, crew member, observer or admirer. Personality profiles, record attempts and annual events spring to life in the pages of Balloon Life.<p>

In-depth Special Reports are a monthly trademark of Balloon Life. These reports are an indispensable tool for today's balloon enthusiast. Weather, the FAA, pilot skills, maintenance, and more are examined in detail by some of the top balloonists in the sport. But these reports focus on more than the merely technical. Ballooning's past, present and future is examined through subjects like Balloon museums, Civil War ballooning, Commercial operations, Around the World attempts and more.<p>
