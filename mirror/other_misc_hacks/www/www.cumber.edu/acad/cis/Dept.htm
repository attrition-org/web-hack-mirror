<h1 align="center">The Department of</h1>

<h1 align="center">Computer Information Systems</h1>

<p>A recent government and industrial study reports a great demand for men and women
skilled in the operating, processing, and analyzing systems in electronic data processing.
The working conditions are generally excellent, and starting salaries and fringe benefits
are generous. </p>

<p>&nbsp;Our Computer Information Systems program is not designed to teach you how to
build a computer, but rather how to cause one to do the work you want it to do. Your
training will include programming techniques and systems solution methods. </p>

<p>&nbsp;The faculty and staff of the Computer Information Systems Department are
dedicated to the goals and objectives of the college. The department endeavors to heighten
the students awareness of the diverse capabilities of the computer and its ability to be
used as a tool in realistic problem solving in everyday life. </p>

<p><b>Objectives:</b> 

<ul>
  <li>To provide courses leading to a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Information
    Systems.</li>
  <li>To prepare teachers of all disciplines to use the computer as a tool in classroom
    learning and classroom management at all grade levels.</li>
  <li>To provide a training of all disciplines for students who seek a career in Computer
    Information Systems and for those students preparing to enter a graduate program in the
    computing field.</li>
  <li>To broaden the general education programs of students by providing areas of training
    required in modern day life.</li>
</ul>
