    <p><small>We know that many families need help in paying college expenses. That's where
    financial aid comes in. Financial aid can close the gap between the cost of a college
    education and what you are expected to pay. College costs, which include tuition, room and
    board, books, transportation, and personal expenses, will vary from college to college.
    What you are expected to pay is determined by a number of factors, including your family's
    income and assets, taxes, medical and current living expenses, the number of dependents,
    and the number of children in college. Most schools use a standardized form to compute
    this amount. </small></p>
    <p><small>No matter who you are, part of the cost of your education at Cumberland College
    has already been paid for you. Gifts from foundations, alumni, and friends, support from
    the Kentucky Baptist Convention, endowment income, and sound fiscal policies allow us to
    keep our costs low, much lower than the &quot;market value&quot; of the education we
    offer. In fact, Cumberland is one of the most affordable private, four-year colleges in
    America. Around 85% of our students receive some type of financial aid.</small></p>
    <p><small>For the <strong>1999-2000</strong> school year, basic charges for a full-time
    student will be as follows:</small></p>
    <p><small>Tuition and Fees: $9,480<br>
    Room and Board: $4,076<br>
    Total: $13,556</small></p>
    <p><small>Cumberland College does not charge an additional tuition fee for students who
    are not residents of Kentucky. </small></p>
    <p><small>Financial aid is designed to make up the difference between the cost of your
    education and what you are expected to pay. Normally, financial aid comes in a package
    that combines different types of assistance: scholarships, grants, low-interest loans, or
    opportunities for campus employment. </small></p>
    <h3 align="center"><small>SCHOLARSHIPS</small></h3>
    <p><small>Students who meet special qualifications may receive financial aid in the form
