<p>LOVE - John 15:12-17</p>

<p>Childhood memories are priceless. Attending the candlelight Christmas Eve services at
my grandparents<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font> church is among my most
precious memories. As if it were yesterday I remember entering the vestibule, filled with
laughter and conversation. My grandfather<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>s
strong, gentle hands guided me along, and I was filled with love as he reacquainted me
with everyone we encountered.</p>

<p>As the service began we listened while the minister spoke. He read from the Bible
important words, but to me, words none the same. And then the music began. As we sang, the
room became alive. Old voices, young voices, good voices, and bad voices wondrously
intertwined together into a beautiful choir singing praises about the birth of the Christ
child.</p>

<p>As we took our candles and lit them one by one, the now darkened sanctuary took on a
new dimension. It was magnificent and magical with flickering candles and dancing shadows.
I sang loudly and proudly. As if with the Magi, I was there following the star to the
manger where the baby Jesus lay.</p>

<p>&quot;</font>Silent Night, Holy Night, wondrous star lend thy light. ...</p>

<p>Christ the Savior is born, Christ the Savior is born.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font></p>

<p>There was a hush to the room as we left. Couples holding hands, singles in groups,
families arm in arm, strangers now become friends. I had come filled with love of my
family, but in the span of an hour I was leaving brimming with the love of mankind in my
heart, for together we had shared in the spirit of Christmas, which is the birth of Jesus
Christ.</p>
