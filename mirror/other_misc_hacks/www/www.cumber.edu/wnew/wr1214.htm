<p>JOY - Hebrews 12:2</p>

<p>It is possible to assemble a jigsaw puzzle face down - well, at least hypothetically.
Someone, somewhere is probably doing that very thing right now.</p>

<p>Most Christians are aware that their lives can be as complicated as a jigsaw puzzle.
There is a lot to think about. There are many things that must get done, especially if you
are to have a successful life. At least that is what we are told.</p>

<p>We plan our days, weeks, months, and even years. We foresee problems and try to come up
with workable answers. It is part of our day-to-day life. And we become machine-like
bodies carrying busy brains through a complicated existence, putting the pieces together.</p>

<p>Then someone reminds us that we are to give attention to our spiritual lives, and we
envision the solution in another list of requirements that will demand more of our limited
resources.</p>

<p>Thankfully, especially around Christmas, we have moments of insight and revelation and
see how readily we have turned our perspective upside down. We realize that we haven<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>t looked at the cover of the puzzle box or even seen
the <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font>picture side<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font> of the pieces in quite a while.</p>

<p>I like simple solutions. Jesus came to bring a simple solution . . . a way to eternal
life. And while He was here, provided some helpful suggestions: things like <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font>God is spirit, so those who worship Him must
worship Him in spirit and truth<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font> (John
4:24). A reminder that we are to see ourselves first as spiritual beings <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">-</font> the <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font>not
upside-down<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font> view.</p>

<p>Picture side up. Picture side up. Picture side up. . .</p>
