<p>Dr. Robert O. Williams (pictured in the top painting) has collected crosses for most of
his adult life. As a chaplain in the Air Force he became aware of the special symbolism
the cross had for Christians and of the variety of forms that had been used to portray
this symbol. He began his collection with the small lapel cross he wore as part of his
uniform. After thirty years of collecting the Carl Williams Cross Museum now contains over
7,000 crosses and crucifixes. </p>

<p>Dr. Williams is a native of Henderson County, Kentucky. He received a Bachelor of Arts
degree from Georgetown College in 1948 and Bachelor of Divinity and Master of Religious
Education degrees from The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in 1951 and 1955
respectively. Dr. Williams served as pastor of churches in Illinois and Kentucky with his
longest pastorate (1963-1988) being at Clifton Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky. </p>

<p>For a period of time the Williams Cross Museum was located on Market Street in downtown
Louisville, Kentucky. In the spring of 1992 Dr. Williams donated his collection to
Cumberland College in Williamsburg, Kentucky. The collection is now housed on the second
floor of the Cumberland Museum which is located just off I-75 at Exit 11. The Museum is
joined to the Cumberland Inn and Conference Center. </p>

<p>Dr. Williams donated his important collection to Cumberland College in memory of his
son Carl (pictured in the bottom painting). Carl was a 1980 alumnus of Cumberland College
who following his graduation served as pastor of Beech Grove Baptist Church in Bullitt,
Kentucky. Carl died in 1981 although his memory lives on in his family and friends. The
Carl Williams Cross Museum celebrates the life and faith of Carl. </p>
