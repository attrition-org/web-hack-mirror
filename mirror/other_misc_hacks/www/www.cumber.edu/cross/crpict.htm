<p>The Carl Williams Cross Museum consists of over 7,000 crosses and crucifixes. These
examples of art and Christian symbolism have been collected from across North America,
South America, Africa, Asia and Europe. Dr. Robert O. Williams has purchased most of the
crosses himself during his own travels in North and South America but friends who have
appreciated and supported his efforts in building and displaying his collection have given
him crosses from Africa, Asia and Europe. The collection thus reflects a variety of
artistic styles. </p>

<p>Some of the crosses in the Carl Williams Cross Museum were specially made for Dr.
Williams. The cross pictured on the right was hand crafted by a prisoner in the LaGrange
Reformatory in LaGrange, Kentucky. At the foot of the cross lies a ball and chain with an
open shackle. This work of art beautifully captures the forgiveness available through
Christ. </p>

<p>While most of the crosses on display are the work of craftsmen's hands, some of the
crosses are simply products of nature. The variety of the collection underscores the
powerful symbolism of the cross throughout the world. Dr. Williams is fond of saying that
&quot;God gave us the Cross, the Cross gives us God.&quot; </p>

<p>Virtually every style of cross is represented in the collection.</p>
