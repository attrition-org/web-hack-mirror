Welcome to Cumberland College CyberChat</h2></center>
We are glad that you are joining us today. Please feel free to explore
our web site as well as our chat rooms presented in CyberChat.
<p>Here are helpful hints that you may want to keep in mind as you enter
CyberChat:
<br>1. The first page is a participant information page. This lets us know
a little about you. Please fill this out completely. *click submit*
<p>2. *Click here to enter Cyberchat* (this takes just a moment to load)
<p>3. You will now be at the log-in for CyberChat. Please enter your &quot;nick&quot;
(the name you will be known by in the chat rooms) as well as your E-mail
address. Go directly into the lobby (stated #lobby). From this point there
will be someone to help you initially, and you can also find other rooms
you may be interested in here. Just double-click on the room you want to
go into and it will take you there. *Note: There may be more rooms than
can be seen; be sure to scroll down the list to see what is available.
<p>4. To chat: type in the bottom line and press enter when you are ready
