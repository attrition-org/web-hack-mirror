    </div><p align="left"><font size="+3" color="#990000" face="Franklin Gothic Medium"><i>1999-2000
    Season Outlook</i></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Cumberland College finished with a
    23-11 record last season and reached the championship game of the Mid-South
    Tournament.&nbsp; Most would call it a successful season, but for the Indians it fell just
    a little short of expectations.&nbsp; The 23 wins fell two short of a team goal of winning
    25 games, which Cumberland College has done ten times under Coach Randy Vernon.&nbsp; The
    63-58 loss to Georgetown in the finals of the conference tournament blocked another
    goal.&nbsp; &quot;The bottom line for us is we want to get to the National
    Tournament,&quot; Vernon said.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Franklin Gothic Medium">There will be a lot of new faces on
    the Cumberland College roster this season, but the goals will remain much the same.&nbsp;
    Gone are starting guards, Tony Pietrowski and Dewayne Saulsberry.&nbsp; Pietrowski holds
    the school's assist record.&nbsp; Starting forwards Dan Emmons and Shawn Rhymer must also
    be replaced.&nbsp; Damien Troupe departs after missing most of last season with a knee
    injury.&nbsp; Those five seniors comprised most of the team's minutes, points, assists and
    rebounds.&nbsp; The hardest things to replace could be the experience and basketball
    knowledge they brought to the team.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Ivan Johnson and Frank Brillhart
    have the most experience of the six returning players.&nbsp; Brillhart (6'7&quot;, 225) is
    the team's only returning starter.&nbsp; He led the team in rebounding last year at over
    seven per game.&nbsp; Brillhart pulled down 20 rebounds in one game and reached double
    figures in rebounds several other times.&nbsp; &quot;The thing Frank can do best for us is
    rebound,&quot; Vernon said.&nbsp; &quot;Brillhart added some size and strength in the off
    season, which should help him battle with some of the bigger post players in the
    conference.&quot;</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Johnson (6'0&quot;, 205) played the
    role of sixth man last year.&nbsp; Johnson is both strong and athletic, which gives him a
    variety of ways to score offensively.&nbsp; Johnson is best in the open court.&nbsp;
    &quot;As the season went on he earned more and more minutes,&quot; Vernon said.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The other returning players from
    last season include guards Calvin Damper and Mark Vernon.&nbsp; Forwards John Mahal and
    Chris McGill return for their senior season.&nbsp; Each of the four saw limited playing
    time last season.&nbsp; Mark Vernon (6'1&quot;, 165) and Damper (6'2&quot;, 190) will add
    depth on the perimeter.&nbsp; Mahal (6'6&quot;, 210) and McGill (6'7&quot;, 200) are
    expected to battle for playing time with a talented group of newcomers.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The majority of the Indians' roster
    will come from a group of eight recruits.&nbsp; The class brings a lot of athletic ability
    and adds size to the roster.&nbsp; There is also a question mark when you add so many new
    players to the mix.&nbsp; &quot;I just know from past experience when we try to break in
    that many it takes a while,&quot; Vernon said.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Franklin Gothic Medium">One interesting battle to watch
    will be between freshmen J.P. Storm and Shannon Miller at the point guard.&nbsp; &quot;I
    like both of them.&nbsp; I think they're going to have a heck of a battle,&quot; Vernon
    said.&nbsp; Miller (6'0&quot;, 165) comes to Cumberland from Lawrence Central High School
    in Indianapolis, Indiana.&nbsp; He is a heady player who understands how to play the
    game.&nbsp; His athletic ability impressed both his coach and teammates during the
    pre-season.&nbsp; Storm (6'0&quot;, 175) scored over 1,500 points in his high school
    career at South Laurel, which ranks second in school history.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The only other freshman in the
    recruiting class is Marco Renz (6'8&quot;, 190) from Stuttgart, Germany.&nbsp; Renz has a
    lot of potential once he adjusts to changes he faces on and off the court in making the
    move from Germany.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Franklin Gothic Medium">From the junior college ranks comes
    Jerry Williams (6'5&quot;, 210).&nbsp; Williams is originally from Orlando, Florida.&nbsp;
    He comes to the Indians from junior college power San Jacinto (TX).&nbsp; The junior
    swingman could be the most athletic player the Indians have had in a number of
    years.&nbsp; He averaged 13 points and 7 rebounds per game at San Jacinto playing both
    inside and on the perimeter.&nbsp; &quot;His strength is in transition and getting to the
    basket,&quot; Vernon said.&nbsp; Williams will give the Indians a very athletic perimeter
    attack when combined with Johnson and one of the freshmen at point guard.&nbsp; That may
    lead the Indians to turn up the tempo on offense.&nbsp; &quot;I think this team is going
    to have to push it up the floor a little more than some of my teams,&quot; Vernon said.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Another junior college transfer is
    Anthony Simmons from Frank Phillips Junior College (TX).&nbsp; Simmons (6'6&quot;, 200)
    averaged 14 points and 7 rebounds as a two-year starter at Frank Phillips.&nbsp; Simmons
    is also strong and athletic and capable of running the floor.&nbsp; Jim Handlos
    (6'8&quot;, 195) played high school basketball at Wayne County (KY) but comes to the
    Indians from Allegheny Community College in Maryland.&nbsp; Handlos has good fundamentals
    and is capable of stepping out to shoot the perimeter.&nbsp; He has also developed a baby
    hook shot that is hard to defend.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Mario Hall comes to the Indians
    after red shirting last year at Hazard Community College.&nbsp; Hall (6'7&quot;, 215)
    played his high school basketball at Owensboro Apollo where he was one of the top-rated
    players in the Third Region as a senior.&nbsp; Peter Arigu (6'5&quot;, 200) from
    Nassarawa, Nigeria played last year at Bismark State Junior College (ND).&nbsp; The
    hard-working Arigu could play either forward position.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The Indians'
    schedule doesn't feature many changes this year.&nbsp; Along with the conference teams,
    there are the usual opponents like Pikeville, Transylvania and Brescia.&nbsp; Cumberland
    will be playing in the American Host Tournament in Ashland, Ohio December 29-30.&nbsp;
    They will open against Mount Vernon Nazarene and could face Ashland, probably a top-20
    team in NCAA Division II.</font> </p>
