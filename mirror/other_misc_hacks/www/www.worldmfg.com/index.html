that's right friends, it's time for me to rant again...<br>
and you know what that means, one way or another what i have to say is prolly gonna be appealing. see the thing is it seems many people are hip to my scheme, you know that whole information security thing. some of the mails i've recieved you wouldnt believe, all about people's concerns with information security. anyway damn i had no idea, i had anyone an everyone ranging from a little old lady on her imac (how you doin?) to some of the very conglomor4ts i spit shit on. probably one of the most interesting was one from one of the sites i tagged, thanking me for bringing his attention to his little problem and complimenting my views, hell he went on to say and i quote "shit, even if i could have traced ya down i wouldnt even have bothered." i mean touching really, i'm glad that i defaced your site you could see past it and listen to what was meant to be heard. of course the fact that when you load a page tagged by fux0r you don't have to worry about rants of "I OWN YOU" or any of that evil hax0r crap because it's not what we're about. we are trying to bring attention and maybe even help in the process by combining efficiency with maybe even a little bit of humor. hell we want admins whom we inform to be able to just look at a fux0r tag on their site and laugh, change their index, go have some stiff drinks and a lap dance as prescribed and then the next day work on helping themselves. because they know nothing got harmed, they just got that vote of yay0r in their favor for a new look at the current situations that caused it to happen. anyway this has inspired to us to try and start something whom anyone true is more than willing to help with. it will start with a webpage that will serve as a resource for information that should be there for the people. it will be the thing we will begin to link back to to serve as unified views in one place there for the judging. anyway me and the other very few current members of fux0r are taking the initiative of helping people out. applications of various uses will be created and freely distributed to serve as alternatives to the conglomor4t mouse-tr4p. not controlled by corpor4t standards and over the shoulder looking big brother to regulate them. we're thinking everything from super simple idiot proof win32 encryption
tools for the old lady down the street sending messages to her family across the country to *nix based self auditing tools for the very beginner to make sure they didnt overlook anything tooo obvious. i dunno, i plan on hopefully making all sorts of shit. point being we hope to atleast contribute a little bit, and <b>no</b>, if you're even thinking it, it won't be some stupid ploy to spread some internet shaking virus or something, but that's up to who-ever, i mean thats why they'll
be offered, simply as an alternative.. oblah di, oblah dah...

admin: nothing harmed in anyway, just bringing your attention to a flaw which
allowed me to deface your website, might as well have been me, because i dont
hurt anything. no grudges held, don't lose your buzz, all is well. if ya think
about it i'm sure you'll see this probably could have been prevented, but who 
knows...
anyway have a nice day, and remember fux0r luvs yew...
