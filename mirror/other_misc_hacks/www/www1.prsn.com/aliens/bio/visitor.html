Nana Visitor plays "Colonel Kira Nerys" on the television series "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine," a Bajoran female who is a former terrorist. She has been
fighting for Bajoran independence most of her life and is skeptical of the Federation's involvement on
Deep Space Nine. "Kira embodies the warrior archetype that all women to a lesser or greater degree
possess," Nana explains. "Her aggression is not without purpose, but is passionately connected to her
love of the culture, spirituality, and history of the people of Bajor. A mentally and physically fearless
fighter, she'll do anything for what she believes is for the good of Bajor."

A New York native, Nana was born and raised on the westside, in and around the theater district. The
daughter of theatrical parents, Nana's father was a Broadway choreographer, and her mother, a ballet
instructor. Nana herself began to study ballet in her mother's studio at age 7, and by the end of high
school, was tapping her way to Broadway.

Visitor appeared with Angela Lansbury in the touring production of "Gypsy," and later appeared in "42nd
Street." Her other stage credits include "My One and Only," "The Ladies Room" at the Tiffany Theater in
