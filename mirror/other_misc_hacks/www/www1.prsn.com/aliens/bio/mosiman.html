Accomplished actress and singer, Marnie Mosiman has quite an extensive list of 
credits in all entertainment mediums.

Born and raised in a musical environment in Minneapolis, Marnie attended public 
school as well as The Children's Theatre School. Singing was Marnie's 
introduction to the entertainment, and her resume intitially included many familiar musicals as she performed in Summer Stock across the country during her college years. Recently Marnie reprised her earlier musical experiences when she appeared in Sondheim's Sweeney Todd with Kelsey Grammer 
and Christine Baranski at the LA Music Center. Her work with other 
regional theatres across the country, including the Guthrie, A.C.T., Seattle 
Rep (where she met husband John de Lancie), the Empty Space, Intiman, and South Coast Rep has earned her an L.A. Critics Award (equivalent to N.Y.'s Tony Award) and five Drama-Logue awards.

Marnie's film credits include Hero, Exit to Eden, and Perfect Date; she has guest starred on such 
television shows as Frasier, Star Trek, Ali McBeal, Picket Fences, Beverly 
Hills 90210, The Bold and the Beautiful, Dallas, and the Young and the Restless. Marnie can also be heard as the voice of Jessica Rabbit in several animated shorts and at Disneyland, and as the old woman in the new feature, Princess Mononoke.

Marnie currently juggles her busy career with her role as wife and mother. John 
and Marnie have two boys (Keegan and Owen deLancie) and an Airedale, Zoë.
