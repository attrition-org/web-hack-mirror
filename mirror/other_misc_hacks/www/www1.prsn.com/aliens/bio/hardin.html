Jerry Hardin was born in Dallas, Texas and attended Southwestern University in Texas on a theatre scholarship. Upon completing his Bachelor of Arts degree, he was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London, England. While abroad he received a re-grant for a second year of studies, so in addition to his time at the Academy Hardi@n was able to see nearly all of Shakespeare's plays performed by the companies of The Old Vic, Bristol Rep, and Birmingham Rep. During this time there was a very vital "off-West-End" movement that was doing Restoration Comedies and Renaissance plays with well-known actors, An absolute feast of classics!

Upon his return to the U.S., Hardin was selected bv fellow-Texan Mary Martin to receive the Barter Award. This honor afforded him the opportunity to spend several years doing stock and touring one-night stands in plays from Shakespeare to Edward Albee. The Barter Theatre became the springboard for shows Off-Broadway, whole seasons with Arena Stage, The Alley, Stage West, Manitoba Theatre Center, The Globe, and many others. Hardin spent eleven years in regional theatre appearing almost daily on stage!

In 1971 the Hardin family moved to Los Angeles, California. Shortly thereafter, Hardin began a career in film and television. His work has included guest star appearances in many episodic television shows such as Star Trek - The Next Generation, The X-Files, Miami Vice, LA Law, Quantum Leap, Golden Girls, I'll Fly Away, Picket Fences, and a years' run as a series lead on Filthy Rich. Feature films brought new opportunities to work with such respected directors as Paul Mazursky in The Tempest, John Schlesinger in The Falcon and the Snowman, Warren Beatty in Reds, Richard Benjamin in Little Nikita, Woody Allen in Sleeper, Robert Redford in Milagro Beanfield War, and Sydney Pol!ack in Hardin's latest film The Firm.

The entire Hardin family is in the entertainment business: Hardin's wife, Diane - also a Barter Award Winner - teaches acting to young people and manages a group of young professionals; his daughter, Melora, is an actress with a long resume of film and television experience; and his son, Shawn, is a Film director with experience in documentaries, shorts, and features who was recently voted into the Director's Guild of America. <P>
