Although Dwight Schultz gained wide popularity with science fiction fans through his portrayal of the sweetly maladroit Lt. Reginald Barclay on "Star Trek: The Next Generation," in real life the actor is anything but that, as his achievements firmly establish. 
<P>

Schultz appears for Alien Voices in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World (for Simon & Schuster Audio) and "The First Men in the Moon."
<P>

Born William Dwight Schultz in Baltimore, Maryland, Dwight majored in Theatre Arts at Towson State University before heading to New York. His talents were recognized almost immediately. He was cast in the Chelsea Theatre Center production of Witkiewicz's "The Crazy Locomotive," co-starring opposite another newcomer, Glenn Close. A year later he got the lead in "The Water Engine" for producer Joseph Papp's Public Theatre. The off-Broadway production proved so popular that Papp moved it to the Plymouth Theatre, marking Dwight's Broadway debut. He reunited with Glenn Close in "Crucible of Blood," followed by "Night and Day,' in which his co-star was Maggie Smith. He won the coveted Drama-Logue Award for the revival of "Crucible of Blood." 
Long associated with the Williamstown Playhouse, Dwight appeared in 40 widely differing plays between 1978 and 1989, among them "Peer Gynt," "Camino Real," "Hay Fever" and " Night of the Iguana." 
<P>

During that time he also became a regular on Stephen J. Cannell's immensely popular television action series, "The A-Team," as Capt. H.M. 'Howling Mad' Murdock. 
<P>

"Murdock was basically every person I ever wanted to be," Schultz recalls. "He was every movie star and every fictional character I ever imagined." His sense of fun was contagious: "Do you know, we even had a fan club at Yale?" he reports. "We were a huge demographic success." Another happy benefit of this exposure was that, rather than be intimidated by legitimate theatre, his TV fans followed him to the stage. 
"Fans of 'The A-Team' would come to Williamstown," Dwight remembers proudly. "I'd go outside to say hello and there would be people in line from Kentucky and Colorado -- and they were there because they heard I was doing 'Peer Gynt'. It was a wonderful thing." 
<P>

Dwight's fans followed him into "the final frontier" in 1990 in "Star Trek: The Next Generation". As the insecure Lieutenant Barclay -- nicknamed "Broccoli" by intolerant crew members -- Schultz boldly went where no previous Starfleet graduate had gone. 
"It was a brilliant ploy on the part of the writers," he explains. "After years of nothing but perfect people on starships, Barclay was different. He was a brilliant engineer, but fallible." 
<P>

Among Dwight's feature film credits are "Fat Man and Little Boy" (as J. Robert Oppenheimer) with Paul Newman; "The Long Walk Home" with Sissy Spacek and Whoopi Goldberg; and "The Temp" with Timothy Hutton. He also made a cameo appearance in the 1996 blockbuster "Star Trek: First Contact" as -- you guessed it -- Broccoli, er, Barclay. 
<P>

Dwight Schultz is married to Wendy Fulton, a former actress who is now a family therapist.
