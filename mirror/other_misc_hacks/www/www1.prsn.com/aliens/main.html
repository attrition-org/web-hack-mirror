Alien Voices is a multi-media production company created by Leonard Nimoy and John de Lancie that is dedicated to quality dramatizations of classic science fiction. In 1996, these former "Star Trek" actors began their Alien Voices enterprise by writing, producing, and fully dramatizing state-of-the-art audio plays. By the spring of 1997, the first three Alien Voices audio productions of H.G. Wells': "<A HREF="catalog/timemachine.html"
	onMouseOver="window.status='About this product';return true"
	onMouseOut="window.status='';return true">The Time Machine</A>",  Jules Verne's: "<A HREF="catalog/journey.html"
	onMouseOver="window.status='About this product';return true"
	onMouseOut="window.status='';return true">Journey to the Center of the Earth</A>," and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "<A HREF="catalog/lostworld.html"
	onMouseOver="window.status='About this product';return true"
	onMouseOut="window.status='';return true">The Lost World</A>" were published by industry leader Simon & Schuster Audio. Since then, additional titles, "<A HREF="catalog/firstmen.html"
	onMouseOver="window.status='About this product';return true"
	onMouseOut="window.status='';return true">First Men in the Moon</A>" , "<A HREF="catalog/invisibleman.html"
	onMouseOver="window.status='About this product';return true"
	onMouseOut="window.status='';return true">The Invisible Man</A>" and "<A HREF="scripts/product.asp?productkey=9494"
	onMouseOver="window.status='About this product';return true"
	onMouseOut="window.status='';return true">Spock vs. Q</A>" have been added to the Alien Voices audio collection.

In addition to Simon & Schuster Audio, Alien Voices work has attracted such media    groups as the Sci-Fi Channel, National Public Radio (NPR), New Line Television,  Dramatic Publishing, Rhino Home Video, and most recently the popular Internet group, Real Networks.

For television, The Alien Voices company has written and produced   "<A HREF="catalog/firstmen.html"
	onMouseOver="window.status='About this product';return true"
	onMouseOut="window.status='';return true">First Men in the Moon</A>"; "<A HREF="catalog/lostworld.html"
	onMouseOver="window.status='About this product';return true"
	onMouseOut="window.status='';return true">The Lost World</A>", and "The Halloween Trilogy" (which included Kipling's "Mark of the Beast"; Wilde's "Canterville Ghost"; Poe's "Cask of Amontillado"). The productions aired on The Sci-Fi Channel and were highly praised as "Inspired  Television". Video productions are now available through the Alien Voices store.

In 1998, National Public Radio (NPR) fed 10 hours of Alien Voices' audio to their affiliates nationwide. The programming ran heavily during the Halloween and Thanksgiving holidays, and received a great deal of recognition.

Alien Voices' scripts are published by Dramatic Publishing for performance by theatre groups and schools.
