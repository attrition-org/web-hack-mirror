<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" COLOR="#00FF00" Size="-1">

 Alien Voices has designed a program taking the radio show concept and turning it into a visual, fun and creative school event. Imagine students on stage, in
 front of microphones, scripts in hand. Behind them, and all around them, fellow students are creating sound effects and music. Add a good dose of "imagination" from the
 audience and you can tell any story you want. 

<p>
<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" COLOR="#00FF00" Size="-1" cellspacing="2">  Alien Voices has chosen to bring this program to
 classrooms everywhere because it focuses on more than performance. It is a cross curriculum event that includes literature, history, problem solving, imagination, and teamwork. The productions require little rehearsal time, and are inexpensive to produce.

<br>
<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" COLOR="#00FF00" Size="-1">
Alien Voices is a company of highly trained, skilled professional actors that understand the theatre process. We have found a way to bring great classic English literature "back" through a relatively simple, low budget, and time efficient technique. We are dedicated to teaching this technique to amateurs, encouraging them to look at all aspects of the art. 
 

<p>
Eight Alien Voices' scripts were recently published by Dramatic Publishing. In addition, Alien Voices has also produced an instructional video demonstrating their production technique. The scripts and video are now available by contacting Dramatic Publishing at 815.338.7170 or by visiting their website at <A HREF="http://www.dramaticpublishing.com">dramaticpublishing.com</a>.  <p>
