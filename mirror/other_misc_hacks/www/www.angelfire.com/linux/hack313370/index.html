<center><text> So You are all prolly thinking oh this is lame what a stupid cracker. Yeah well look at what your doing, this takes more time than using msadc.pl and all your other crap. I actually have to start a program that takes longer time for your msadc skills and echo skills to echo "Im l33t">> index.htm. So dont be complaining about how lame this deface is. I know ill be seeing a bunch of "Fuckz:Rocket Team" So anyways.. why cant groups just get along? who really cares what they use. If you look at the majority of people no one even knows what linux is or what an exploit is, they just know how to log onto AOL and talk to people. But if you are talking to certain people and you don't know enough, then you are a lamer, and a waste of time. No one wants to teach you. They tell you to learn on your own and not to bother them. And all of them always say to go read, but guess what they really didnt learn that way, they learned the same way everyone else is trying to, by asking. So next time someone asks you to help them, no matter what it is if you know it, help them. Next,... why is everyone giving everyone else fuckz...? Theres no need for that just think if everyone was in it together, the internet would be owned. Think of all the power, and new things that would come out. It'd be great and hell for everyone else. So I tell you and ask you to accept others, no matter what they used to get on a box, they know more than the admin does seeing as the script kiddied his ass, so dont make fun of others cause you know more them. Why not e-mail them and teach them something new. So any ways thats enough of my lame ass :). So take in consideration what i have said, and e-mail me. You all must be jealous of my Angelfire 0day. Well guess what you can have it to, own any angelfire site, and a geocites one coming too. Just e-mail me. Also if you would like my new trojan, e-mail me it runs on port 666 so watch out. And you nix people that think you cant be infected by it guess again, you can be.</text></center>
