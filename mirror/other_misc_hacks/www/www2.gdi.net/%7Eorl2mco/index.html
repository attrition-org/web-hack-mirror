            <i>Since the Shafer Commission reported their findings to Congress 
            in 1972 advocating marijuana decriminalization, <b>over ten million 
            Americans have been arrested on marijuana charges.</b> Marijuana prohibition 
            is a failed public policy that is out of touch with today's social 
            reality and inflicts devastating harm on millions of citizens.</i></font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><i> 
            </i></font></font></p>
          <p align="left"> <font size="4"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">In 1972, 
            a blue-ribbon panel of experts appointed by President Richard Nixon 
            and led by former Pennsylvania Governor Raymond Shafer concluded that 
            marijuana prohibition posed significantly greater harm to the user 
            than the use of marijuana itself. The National Commission on Marijuana 
            and Drug Abuse recommended that state and federal laws be changed 
            to remove criminal penalties for possession of marihuana for personal 
            use and for the casual distribution of small amounts of marijuana. 
            That year, law enforcement arrested almost 300,000 Americans on marijuana 
            charges. <a href="crazy.foot.shtml#foot17"></a></font></font></p>
          <p align="left"> <font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
            1982 National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) report on marijuana reaffirmed 
            that criminal justice approaches were inappropriate and harmful. It 
            recommended not only that marijuana possession be decriminalized, 
            but that lawmakers give serious consideration to creating a system 
            of regulated distribution and sale. Law enforcement arrested over 
            450,000 Americans for violating marijuana laws that year. </font>
          <p align="left"> <font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
            May of this year, research findings from a comprehensive, long term 
            study performed by Kaiser Permanente concluded that no link existed 
            between regular marijuana smoking and mortality and emphasized that 
            marijuana prohibition posed the only significant health hazard to 
            the user. The report advocated that &quot;medical guidelines regarding 
            [marijuana's] prudent use ... be established, akin to the common-sense 
            guidelines that apply to alcohol use.&quot; In 1995, the most recent 
            year for which the federal government has arrest statistics, law enforcement 
            charged almost 600,000 Americans with marijuana violations. This figure 
            is the greatest number ever recorded since marijuana prohibition began; 
            it means that <cite>one marijuana smoker is arrested every 45 seconds 
            in America.</cite> </font>
          <p align="left"> <font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite 
            criticism that President Clinton is &quot;soft&quot; on drugs, annual 
            data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform Crime 
            Report demonstrate that Clinton administration officials are waging 
            a more intensive war on marijuana smokers than any other presidency 
            in history. Law enforcement arrested approximately 1.5 million Americans 
            on marijuana charges during the first three years of Clinton's administration 
            -- 84 percent of them for simple possession. The average number of 
            yearly marijuana arrests under Clinton (483,548) is 30 percent higher 
            than under the Bush administration (338,998), and last year's total 
            alone is more than double the 1991 total <nobr>(287,850). </nobr> 
            </font>
          <p align="left"> <font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marijuana 
            penalties vary nationwide, but most levy a heavy financial and social 
            impact for the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are arrested 
            each year. In 42 states, possession of any amount of marijuana is 
            punishable by incarceration and/or a significant fine. <a href="crazy.foot.shtml#foot23"></a> 
            For example, individuals arrested for simple marijuana possession 
            in Arizona may face eighteen months in jail and a $150,000 fine. Many 
            states also have laws automatically suspending the drivers' license 
            of an individual if they are convicted of any marijuana offense, even 
            if the offense was not driving related. </font>
          <p align="left"> <font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Penalties 
            for marijuana cultivation and/or sale also vary from state to state. 
            Ten states have maximum sentences of five years or less and eleven 
            states have a maximum penalty of thirty years or more. <a href="crazy.foot.shtml#foot25"></a> 
            Some states punish those who cultivate marijuana solely for personal 
            use as severely as large scale traffickers. For instance, medical 
            marijuana user William Foster of Oklahoma was sentenced to 93 years 
            in jail in January 1997 for growing 10 medium-sized marijuana plants 
            and 56 clones (cuttings from another plant planted in soil) in a 25-square-foot 
            underground shelter. Foster maintains that he grew marijuana to alleviate 
            the pain of rheumatoid arthritis. Unfortunately, Foster's plight is 
            not an isolated event; marijuana laws in six states permit marijuana 
            importers and traffickers to be sentenced to life in jail. </font>
          <p align="left"> <font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even 
            those who avoid state incarceration are subject to an array of punishments 
            that may include submitting to random drug tests, probation, paying 
            for mandatory drug counseling, loss of an occupational license, expensive 
            legal fees, lost wages due to absence from work, loss of child custody, 
            loss of federal benefits, and removal from public housing. In some 
            states, police will notify the employers of people who are arrested. 
            As a result, employees may lose their job. </font>
          <p align="left"> <font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal 
            laws prohibiting marijuana are also severe. Under federal law, possessing 
            one marijuana cigarette or less is punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 
            and one year in prison, the same penalty as for possessing small amounts 
            of heroin and cocaine. In one extreme case, attorney Edward Czuprynski 
            of Michigan served 14 months in federal prison for possession of 1.6 
            grams of marijuana before a panel of federal appellate judges reviewed 
            his case and demanded his immediate release. Cultivation of 100 marijuana 
            plants or more carries a mandatory prison term of five years. Large 
            scale marijuana cultivators and traffickers may be sentenced to death. 
            </font>
          <p align="left"> <font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, 
            Congress is proposing that the amount of marijuana necessary to trigger 
            the death penalty be substantially lowered. The &quot;Drug Importer 
            Death Penalty Act of 1997,&quot; introduced by admitted former marijuana 
            smoker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), would potentially sentence first offenders 
            convicted of bringing more than 50 grams (less than two ounces) of 
            marijuana across U.S. borders to life in prison without parole. Those 
            offenders convicted for a second time -- presumably the first offense 
            would have been convicted before H.R. 41's enactment -- would be sentenced 
            to death. Thirty-seven members of Congress are present cosponsors 
            of this bill. </font>
          <p align="left"> <font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal 
            laws also deny entitlements to marijuana smokers. Under legislation 
            introduced by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) and signed into law last year, 
            states may deny cash aid (e.g., welfare, etc.) and food stamps to 
            anyone convicted of felony drug charges. For marijuana smokers, this 
            includes most convictions for cultivation and sale, even for small 
            amounts and nonprofit transfers. Currently, a murderer, rapist, or 
            robber could receive federal funds and benefits, but not most individuals 
            convicted of cultivating a small amount of marijuana. </font>
          <p align="left"> <font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
            addition, under both state and federal law, mere investigation for 
            a marijuana offense can result in the forfeiture of property, including 
            cash, cars, boats, land, business equipment, and houses. Amazingly, 
            the owner does not have to be found guilty or even formally charged 
            with any crime for the seizure to occur. In 1993, Illinois Congressman 
            Henry Hyde (R) reported that 80 percent of the individuals whose assets 
            are seized by the federal government under drug forfeiture laws are 
            never charged with a crime. Law enforcement often targets suspected 
            marijuana offenders for the purpose of seizing their property, sometimes 
            with tragic results. For example, millionaire rancher Donald Scott 
            was shot and killed by law enforcement officials in 1992 at his Malibu 
            estate in a botched raid. Law enforcement failed to find any marijuana 
            plants growing on his property and later conceded that their primary 
            motivation for investigating Scott was to eventually seize his land. 
            </font>
          <p align="left"> <font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State 
            and federal marijuana laws also have a disparate racial impact on 
            ethnic minorities. While blacks and Hispanics make up only 20 percent 
            of the marijuana smokers in the U.S., they comprised 55 percent of 
            the marijuana offenders sentenced under federal law in 1995. State 
            arrest and incarceration rates paint a similar portrait. For example, 
            in Illinois, 57 percent of those sent to prison for marijuana in 1995 
            were black or Hispanic. In California, 49 percent of those arrested 
            for marijuana offenses in 1994 were black or Hispanic. And in New 
            York state, 71 percent of those arrested for misdemeanor marijuana 
            charges in 1995 were non-white. </font>
