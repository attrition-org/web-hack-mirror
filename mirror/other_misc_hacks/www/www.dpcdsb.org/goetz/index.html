I can't believe I go to this skool.<br>Actually, it's a pretty good skool.  And I have no friggin' clue why I'm actuallysaying this krap because no1 actually ever comes to this site, which makesthis even more pathetic and a waste of time.<br>Hey, where do I join up for the Computer Club?  I've beenwondering for a long time.  Gordon Graydon.com has the IBT programplus their own domain!  I didn't like the fact that they had theirown domain and we didn't, which is why I hacked them twice!  Mr.  Kurn, the Graydon web-site ADMIN and supposed computer literate or even whiz,had no idea what his site he put up was running on.  He justcommanded his little website group to whip up a lameassweb-page on Frontpage and left all the VTI Frontpage Extensions on there...  And then he used Media101 as his password,and when he was hacked the first time, he changed it to Mediaman!And I'll bet he paid $4000 for an A+ Certificate saying heknows how to use Frontpage and Windows 95/98, but what's the point if Microsoft has huge exploits in their products?Gee, I really do hope Mr.  Kurn learns, he should get Linuxfor Dummies and start reading.  Oh yea, back to my original question, where do I join up for this new eleet k-rad computer club of Goetz?With me on your side, we could hack down all the public school'snetworks, and even Xavier's!  Cause we really hate them hillibillies!And oh yea, last note, CONGRATS to the Junior Goetz football team, we came in second, that's a hell of alot better than everyone else cept' for Lorne PArk, and CONGRATSto them too.<br>While I'm on it, props to Jay and Robby on the team.<BR><hr color=red size=1><br><hr color=blue size=2><font size=5 color=blue>SHOUT OUTS\RESPECT:</font>(In no particular order)<br><font color=lime size=3>Woodstock (RedGrlsexy!),Baby_Peach, Flaming_Phoenix, v00d00, Nemesystm, RFG (Rain.Forest.Puppy), Attrition.org,Hackernews.com, YTCracker, Dukj, Fuqrag, sSh, Kaygee.com, L0pht, cDc, HackCanada.com, Kevin Poulsen, Kevin Mitnick,and everyone else.<br><hr color=blue size=2><br><CENTER><font color=red size=6>F R E E &nbsp;M I T N I C K !</FONT></body></html>
