First of all we have to say that we a neither pro-palestine or pro-israelian. We are totally neutral.<BR>
We don't like to see defacements from these groups, cause everbody stereotypes the enemy.<BR>
Maybe both party's made mistakes... we guess you did never think of this possiblity!<BR>
So...why don't you try to just find a compromise and live together somehow?
<H2>Can't we...can't we just live in peace?</H2>
