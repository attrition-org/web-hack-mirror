By Chief Edwards</p>

<hr>

<p>Welcome to the City of Trenton, Florida.&nbsp; We are located on State Road 26 about 30
miles west of Gainesville, Florida.&nbsp; Trenton has a population of Approximately 1,300
people.&nbsp; The county seat of Gilchrist County is located in Trenton as well as Trenton
High School.&nbsp; June and July is Watermelon Season (Gilchrist County's largest crop)
and we have a State Farmer's Market located in the City of Trenton on State Road 47.
&nbsp; Large truck loads of watermelon asnd cantaloupes leave Trenton, going all over
America.</p>

<p>The Trenton Police Department was started back up in 1988.&nbsp; The City used to
contract services from the Gilchrist County Sheriff's Office.&nbsp; In October, 1988 I was
hired as the only police officer on the Trenton Police Department.&nbsp; Eventually, we
started a Police Auxiliary, only taking employed people who had full Police Standards.
&nbsp; This way the Auxiliary Officer would&nbsp; have full arrest powers and could work
on patrol by himself.&nbsp; This was a non-paying job, but the City of Trenton pays for
the uniforms, insurance and helped the officers keep up their police standards.&nbsp; This
gives the City more police coverage and we fell it gives a new police officer good on the
job training so that eventually they can go to a larger agency and get a full-time paid
job as a Law Enforcement Officer.&nbsp; Currently the Trenton Police Department has three
full-time and three auxiliary officers on staff.&nbsp; One of our paid officers works
under a COPS FAST Grant</p>

<p>At this time, we enjoy a very low crime rate and a good, quite town, which I am
proud of.&nbsp; I am very happy to say that for the past 10 years the City has had no
unsolved murders, armed robberies or bank robberies.</p>

<p>I would like to thank all the past and present officers for a job very well done.
&nbsp; Also I would like to thank the Gilchrist County Sheriff's Office and Lancaster
Correctional Institute's K-9 unit for all their help.&nbsp; Working together, we can make
a difference.</p>

<p><strong><big>POLICE DOPPLER RADAR IN USE</big></strong></p>

MPH and 30 MPH.&nbsp; Oh State Road 26 the speed limits are 55 MPH,45 MPH, and 35 MPH.
&nbsp; The speed limits on other city streets are posted at 25 MPH.&nbsp; There is a 10
