Well - since I first threatened china till poisonb0x defaced a zillion sites the media has been real interested in this whole gay - whos gonna own whos country - thing. Looking at the statistics I think it would be safe to say that chinese hackers were just full of hot air - and cant back up their threats. what do you think? email me and let me know.
