Subject: Site mirror request

I wish to inquire on behalf of one our security employees about having his site mirrored.  I am the Tennessee Department of Revenue Webmaster and R&D Supervisor.  We have been doing security analysis on our Internet and intranet servers.  We would like the site below mirrored for training / presentation purposes, but not posted.  

The site belongs to John Carl Johnson and is at URL :

www.johnc.freeservers.com/statetnhacked.html   (the hacked site)

The target site is at URL:

www.state.tn.us 

Thank you,
