Subject: About the State of Tennessee Website

/.

Hola, You may have a letter from my soon to be former employers at the State 
of Tennessee asking you to mirror a website that I found some flaws in. 
This was my first government site, so I took some time wtih it. Thank you 
for not responding to them directly, they asked me several times by the 
end of the day why they hadn't heard from you.  I explained that the process 
of mirroring a site takes time and to be patient, you would be doing this 
as a favor, not as a request.  Please, go ahead and use this link to link 
to the defaced site.  If you wish, you can link it from your page, I don't 
care, just that they told me that their site was untouchable and they said 
no one could get at it, well, we all have heard those famous last words. 
 Nothing is impossible.  Thank you for your time and I hope to see you in 
LV in a few weeks.

the gov.      site:   http://www.state.tn.us			This is their page.

Thank you for the work that you do and you hold a special place in my links 
section.  NZ kicks ass, see you soon at 8.

Hasta
DMadHtr
