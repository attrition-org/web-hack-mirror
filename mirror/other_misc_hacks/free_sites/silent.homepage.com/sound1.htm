	<P><B>Introduction</B></P>
	<P>Music has played an important role in different cultures since time immemorial. It has profoundly affected human
	beings in their physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well being. But only in this century has music begun
	to attract scientific attention. The research at the University of California in Irvine has provided some information
	about the effect of Mozart on the spatial and mathematical intelligence of children. Recently, an article in the
	<I>Los Angeles Times</I> newspaper (11/9/98) reported neurobiological research to the effect that &quot;undeniably,
	there is a biology of music.&quot; Music is destined to play a more active role in the future of medicine. The
	following ideas illustrate how music affects our early development.</P>
	<P>The importance of prenatal music was born in my awareness over twenty years ago when I was expecting my youngest
	son. Through my communication with him telepathically and through his delay in arrival I was able to attend a music
	conference that was very important to me at that time. The doctor thought it would be dangerous for me to participate
	in something very active aside from the fact that he was due that week, and being the second child, he surely would
	arrive early if not on time. Well, our son was born the day after I attended this stimulating week of singing and
	gentle movement.</P>
	<P>Already at that time I observed that lullabies were relegated to the past: young mothers no longer knew this
	folk song tradition. Michel Odent, M.D., believes that women have a profound need to sing to their babies but that
	the medicalization of birth has upset this process. In the past, women all over the world have sung lullabies to
	their babies. These were very important because as we now know the fetus is having first language lessons in the
	womb. The inflections of the mother tongue are conveyed not only through speech but most importantly through song.
	The singing voice has a richer frequency range than speech. In fact, studies in other disciplines such as linguistics
	and musicology (e.g., David Whitwell, 1993) point out that there was a time when speech was song and therefore
	singing is the older of the two. Babies born of deaf mothers miss these important first lessons in language development.
	French pioneer Dr. Alfred Tomatis mentions being intrigued by the fact that song birds hatched by silent foster
	mothers can't sing. What the baby learns in utero are the intonational patterns of sound and the frequencies of
	a language in his/her particular culture. Frequency is the level of pitch measured in Hertz (Hz.) This range varies
	between 16 to 20,000 Hz. There is very little distortion of the mother's voice as heard by the fetus whereas other
	external voices sound more muffled, especially in the higher frequencies. According to Rubel (1984), the fetus
	is responsive first to lower frequencies and then to higher ones.</P>
	<P>Verny and others have noted that babies have a preference for stories, rhymes, and poems first heard in the
	womb. When the mother reads out loud, the sound is received by her baby in part via bone conduction. Dr. Henry
	Truby, Emeritus Professor of Pediatrics and Linguistics at the University of Miami, points out that after the sixth
	month, the fetus moves in rhythm to the mother's speech and that spectrographs of the first cry of an abortus at
	28 weeks could be matched with his mothers. The elements of music, namely tonal pitch, timbre, intensity and rhythm,
	are also elements used in speaking a language. For this reason, music prepares the ear, body and brain to listen
	to, integrate and produce language sounds. Music can thus be considered a pre-linguistic language which is nourishing
	and stimulating to the whole human being, affecting body, emotions, intellect, and developing an internal sense
	of beauty, sustaining and awakening the qualities in us that are wordless and otherwise inexpressible.</P>
	<P>The research of Polverini-Rey (1992) seems to indicate that prenates exposed to lullabies in utero were calmed
	by the stimulus. The famous British violinist Yehudi Menuhin believes that his own musical talent was partly due
	to the fact that his parents were always singing and playing music before he was born.</P>
	<P><B>The Sound Environment of the Womb</B></P>
	<P>The sound environment of the womb is very rich. There are various interpretations as to the noise level, ranging
	between 30 to 96 dB. (decibel being a measure of sound intensity or loudness). A whisper can register 30 dB., a
	normal conversation is about 60 dB. and rush hour traffic can average about 70 dB. On the other hand, shouted conversations
	and motorcycles reach about 100 dB. Rock music has been measured as 115 dB. and the pain threshold begins at 125
	dB. Yet, recent research with hydrophones have revealed that the womb is a &quot;relatively quiet place&quot; (Deliege
	and Sloboda, 1996), something comparable to what we experience in our environment between 50 and 60 dB.</P>
	<P>Uterine sounds form a &quot;sound carpet&quot; over which the mother's voice in particular appears very distinct
	and which the prenate gives special attention because it is so different from its own amniotic environment. These
	sounds are of major importance because they establishes the first patterns of communication and bonding. Some researchers
	have discovered that newborns become calmer and more self-regulated when exposed to intrauterine sound (Murooka
	et. al 1976; DeCasper 1983; Rossner 1979). The soothing sounds of the ocean and water are probably reminiscent
	of the fluid environment in which we began life. Tomatis suggests that the maternal heart beat, respiration and
	intestinal gurgling, all form the source for our collective attraction to the sound of surf and may have to do
	with our inborn sense of rhythm. Prenatal sounds form an important developmental component in prenatal life because
	they provide a foundation for later learning and behavior. With fetal sound stimulation the brain functions at
	a higher level of organization.</P>
	<P>The ear first appears in the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> week of gestation and it becomes functional by the 16<SUP>th</SUP>
	week. The fetus begins active listening by the 24<SUP>th</SUP> week. We know from ultrasound observations that
	the fetus hears and responds to a sound pulse starting about 16 weeks of age (Shahidullah &amp; Hepper, 1992);
	this is even before the ear construction is complete. The cochlear structures of the ear appear to function by
	the 20<SUP>th</SUP> week and mature synapses have been found between the 24<SUP>th</SUP> and 28<SUP>th</SUP> weeks
	(Pujol et al. 1991). For this reason most formal programs of prenatal stimulation are usually designed to begin
	during the third trimester. The sense of hearing is probably the <B>most </B>developed of all the senses before
	birth.</P>
	<P>Four-month-old fetuses can respond in very specific ways to sound; if exposed to loud music, and their heart
	beat will accelerate. A Japanese study of pregnant women living near the Osaka airport had smaller babies and an
	inflated incidence of prematurity-arguably related to the environment of incessant loud noise. Chronic noise can
	also be associated with birth defects (Szmeja et al. 1979). I recently received a report from a mother who was
	in her 7<SUP>th</SUP> month of pregnancy when she visited the zoo. In the lion's enclosure, the animals were in
	process of being fed. The roar of one lion would set off another lion and the sound was so intense she had to leave
	the scene as the fetus reacted with a strong kick and left her feeling ill. Many years later, when the child was
	7 years of age, it was found that he had a hearing deficiency in the lower-middle range. This child also reacts
	with fear when viewing TV programs of lions and related animals. There are numerous reports about mothers having
	to leave war movies and concerts because the auditory stimulus caused the fetus to become hyperactive.</P>
	<P>Alfred Tomatis notes that the ear is &quot;the Rome of the body&quot; because almost all cranial nerves lead
	to it and therefore it is considered our most primary sense organ. Embryonically, according to him, the skin is
	differentiated ear, and we listen with our whole body.</P>
	<P>In order to better understand the role of music in its elements of rhythm and melody, we must briefly clarify
	the two parts of the inner ear. These are the vestibular system and the cochlea. The vestibular system controls
	balance and body movements, including the integration of movements which make up the rhythm of music-making the
	vestibular system the more archaic. And according to Paul Madaule (1984)&quot;it is in fact because of the vestibular
	system that music seems to have an impact on the body.&quot; At around 4 &frac12; to 6 weeks gestational age the
	vestibular and the cochlear systems become differentiated, at 7 &frac12; the auditory ossicles start to grow, and
	at 4 &frac12; months the ear of the fetus is already adult-like in shape and size.</P>
	<P>The cochlear system enables the transformation of acoustic vibrations into nervous influx, thus allowing the
	perception of melodies which carry higher frequencies. Knowing this, one can have a better understanding of the
	intimate relationship and unity of rhythm and melody. George Gershwin expressed this nicely: &quot;Music sets up
	a certain vibration which unquestionably results in a physical reaction.&quot; With this in mind, we should choose
	for early music stimulation melodies and rhythms that are simple.</P>
	<P>Tomatis has a unique view of the function of the human ear going beyond what is traditionally assumed. He regards
	it as neither an instrument solely for hearing and listening, nor an organ for the maintenance of equilibrium and
	verticality. For him the ear is primarily a generator of energy for the brain, intended to give a cortical charge
	which is then distributed throughout the body &quot;with the view to toning up the whole system and imparting greater
	dynamism to the human being&quot; (Gilmor and Madaule, 1984, p. 6). Hence the importance of right sound stimulation
	which will lead to vocal expression, listening, and thinking. Sound, music and human development are intricately
	interwoven.</P>
	<P>Clearly, the vestibular system progresses rapidly as seen by the active movement of the fetus in utero. As early
	as the first trimester, regular exercise patterns have been observed with ultra-sound: rolling, flexing, turning,
	etc. (Van Dongen &amp; Goudie, 1980). The movements appear as graceful somersaults, flexing of the back and neck,
	turning the head, waving arms, kicking legs-- all self initiated and expressive in nature. When the baby moves
	in utero, the heartbeat accelerates. DeMause (1982) summarizes reactions of the second trimester as follows: &quot;The
	fetus now floats peacefully, kicks, turns, sighs, grabs its umbilicus, gets excited at sudden noises, calms down
	when the mother talks quietly, and gets rocked back to sleep as she walks about.&quot;</P>
	<P>The fetal heart is fully developed by the second trimester and its pulse rate oscillates between 120 to 160
	beats per minute. Some think the distinctive rhythm of the mother's heart beat in utero is the basis and our attraction
	to drumming, rock rhythms, and the African tribal beat. Salk (1960), Murooka (1976), and De Casper (1983) provided
	evidence that newborns learned and remembered their mother's heart beat in utero. Ashley Montagu (1962) suggested
	that the universal appeal of music and the soothing effect of rhythmical sounds may be related to the feeling of
	well being assumed to exist in utero in relation to the mother's heartbeat. Salk (1960) showed that newborns in
	hospitals listening to heartbeat sounds gained weight at a faster rate. Likewise, breathing was deeper and more
	regular among these babies. According to W. Ernest Freud &quot;rhythm itself provides a most reassuring 'cradle'
	because of its promise of repetition and continuity.&quot;</P>
	<P><B>Sound and Learning in Utero</B></P>
	<P>The powerful connection between sound/music and prenatal memory/learning have been revealed in formal experiments,
	parental observations, clinical records, and first person reports. Chamberlain (1998) using Howard Gardner's concept
	of multiple intelligences, has presented evidence for musical intelligence before birth. Peter Hepper (1991) discovered
	that prenates exposed to TV soap opera music during pregnancy responded with focused and rapt attention to this
	music after birth-evidence of long-term memory. On hearing the music after birth, these newborns had a significant
	decrease in heart rate and movements, and shifted into a more alert state. Likewise, Shetler (1989) reported that
	33% of fetal subjects in his study demonstrated contrasting reactions to tempo variations between faster and slower
	selections of music. This may be the earliest and most primitive musical response in utero.</P>
	<P>The pioneering New Zealand fetologist, William Liley, found that from at least 25 weeks on, the unborn child
	would jump in rhythm with the timpanist's contribution to an orchestral performance. The research of Michele Clements
	(1977) in a London maternity hospital found that four to five month fetuses were soothed by Vivaldi and Mozart
	but disturbed by loud passages of Beethoven, Brahms and Rock. Newborns have shown a preference for a melody their
	mother sang in utero rather than a new song sung by their mother (Satt, 1987). Babies during the third trimester
	in utero respond to vibroacoustic as well as air-coupled acoustic sounds, indicative of functional hearing. A study
	by Gelman et al. (1982) determined that a 2000 Hz. stimulus elicited a significant increase in fetal movements,
	a finding which supported the earlier study by Johnsson et al. (1964). From 26 weeks to term, fetuses have shown
	fetal heart accelerations in response to vibroacoustic stimuli. Consistent startle responses to vibroacoustic stimuli
	were also recorded during this period of development. Behavioral reactions included arm movements, leg extensions,
	and head aversions (Birnholz and Benacerraf, 1983). Yawning activity was observed after the conclusion of stimuli.
	Research by Luz et al. (1980 and 1985) has found that the normal fetus responds to external acoustic stimulation
	during labor in childbirth. These included startle responses to the onset of a brief stimulus.</P>
	<P>New evidence of cognitive development in the prenatal era is presented by William Sallenbach (1994) who made
	in-depth and systematic observations of his own daughter's behavior from weeks 32 to 34 in utero. (The full report
	of his findings is available on this website in Life Before Birth/Early Parenting) Until recently, most research
	on early learning processes has been in the area of habituation (Querleu et al., 1981), conditioning (Van de Carr,
	1988) or imprinting sequences (Salk, 1962). However, Sallenbach observed that in the last trimester of pregnancy,
	the prenate's learning state shows movement from abstraction and generalization to one of increased specificity
	and differentiation. During a bonding session using music, the prenate was observed moving her hands gently. In
	a special musical arrangement, where dissonance was included, the subject's reactions were more rhythmic with rolling
	movements. Similarly, in prenatal music classes, Sister Lorna Zemke has found that the fetus will respond rhythmically
	to rhythms tapped on the mother's belly.</P>
	<P>From what research is telling us, we may presume that prenates would prefer to hear lullabies sung by their
	mothers, or selected slow passages of Baroque music such as Vivaldi, Telemann, and Handel which have a tempo resembling
	our own heart beat at rest. Recent research has shown that four month old infants demonstrate an innate preference
	for music that is consonant rather than dissonant (Zentner and Kagan, 1998). However, this allows great latitude
	in the selection of music which babies and their mothers might like to hear. Our ultimate objective, of course
	is to help create not a musical genius but a person well integrated in his physical, emotional, intellectual and
	spiritual self.</P>
