<SUP>tm</SUP> Newsletter - Vol. 2 No. 6 </STRONG><IMG SRC="gold2t.gif" WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="95" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></H2>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="gline3.gif" WIDTH="511" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
<P><STRONG>Recently, we were asked as to how to quickly detect if a Silent Sounds <SUP>tm</SUP> tape or Compact
Discs were being infringed upon by a pirate media producer. We are taking this opportunity to pass along the answers
for general information. These testshave proven acceptable as evidence in both Federal and State courts of law.</STRONG>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="gline3.gif" WIDTH="511" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></H3>
<P><STRONG>While we are at it, let's test ALL of the so-called basic or fundamental subliminal and brainware types
of tapes:</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I. THE &quot;MASKED&quot; OR &quot;BURIED&quot; SUBLIMINAL SYSTEM (Becker, et al.)</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Recovery of the messages buried in this system cannot be accomplished by the scientific community. No
known technology exists that can recover a non- periodic signal that is being continuously adjusted to be completely
&quot;jammed&quot; and therefore buried 10 or more decibels below another, continuously active, random or non-periodic,
foreground &quot;noise&quot; signal. If you can do it, please give the Pentagon a quick collect call! They need
your technical knowledge badly. Prof. Becker's basic buried subliminal patent expired in 1973. Alpha-through- Theta
brain rhythm and other VLF non-pulse waveforms cannot be propagated directly though this system as patented because
the recording /playback heads, the audio tape, the record/playback amplifiers and the playback speakers/ earphones
will not pass the very low audio frequencies required.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>II. THE &quot;BEAT FREQUENCY&quot; SYSTEM (Masaki)</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>As you remember from high school physics, when two frequencies, A and B, are mixed together, four output
signals are produced: A, B, (A plus B) and (A minus B). If you tape record, say, 100 cps and 105 cps, four signals
would be produced (at the ear) during playback...100, 105, 205 and 5 cps (unfortunately, all at the same time!).
Or, if you simultaneously record two constantly varying signals that are always spaced, say, 5 cps apart, one of
the four outputs will always be a constant 5 cps signal. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, three other signals
are also heard, two of them massively louder than the other two.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The major problem in detecting and measuring this &quot;beat&quot; difference (or sum) frequency is
that the power of either of the two &quot;passive&quot; products is LESS THAN ONE FIVE MILLIONTHS of the power
of either of the two &quot;active&quot; signals (A and B)! Also, if you turn the volume up in an attempt to increase
the power of the minuscule &quot;beat&quot; frequency, and if A and/or B just happen to be audible tones, you will
soon notice that your eyeballs begin to bulge out!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>That fact notwithstanding, two U.S. Govt Regulatory Agencies will soon begin measuring the output of
these Alpha-through-Theta &quot;beat frequency&quot; tapes as follows: A high Q (Guenther Model 730) variable notch
filter, tuned to the frequency of interest (say, 5 cps) is inserted between the pickup transducer and the output
meter circuitry of a Peak/Averaging, LF/Vibration Level Meter (whose calibration is traceable to the U.S. Bureau
of Standards). The reading (in db) is then taken, on-axis, 36 inches in front of the speaker and the LF/Vibration
Level Meter is referenced to 0.0002 microbars. Regardless of whether the two tones, A and B, are fixed or variable,
the difference frequency is expected to remain nominally constant in the notch bandpass centered on the selected
portion of the Alpha-through-Theta zone.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>All AUDIBLE Alpha-through-Theta products which make use of the &quot;beat frequency&quot; phenomena
come under the omnibus U.S. Patent # 4,834,701, dated May 30, 1989, by Kazumi Masaki of Osaka, Japan (assigned
to Ken Haykashibara of Okayama, Japan). This patent expires in the year 2006. All INAUDIBLE or SILENT &quot;beat
frequency&quot; Alpha-through-Theta devices and tapes are protected under Claim 3 of the Silent Sounds (tm) U.S.
Patent #5,159,703. Therefore, if the word &quot;beat&quot; is used to describe the recording technique or the product,
you know exactly where to start looking to find the legal source of the tape technology.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>You are further aided in your search for the source of the tape by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
(PTO) Regulation which states that, &quot;A Patentee who makes or sells patented articles, or a person who does
so for or under the Patentee, is required to mark the articles with the word &quot;Patent&quot; and the number
of the patent.&quot;</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>III. THE &quot;ENVELOPE MODULATION&quot; SYSTEM (Barbara)</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>This system basically records music, ocean surf or what-have-you and then amplitude modulates or &quot;pumps&quot;
the music's amplitude envelope with a voice message or at an Alpha-through-Theta low frequency rate. Although the
ear cannot hear the voice or the low frequency modulation, the invention claims that the subconscious mind can
perceive it and that the brainwaves are therefore induced into the brain.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The existence and power of the resulting Alpha-through-Theta waves can theoretically be measured in
the same manner and with the same equipment as in System II above.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>All &quot;envelope modulated&quot; audio tapes and devices are protected under the omnibus U.S. Patent
# 4,141,344, dated Feb. 27, 1979, by Louis J. Barbara. This patent expires in 1998.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>IV. THE SILENT SOUND <SUP>tm</SUP> SYSTEM</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>As all of you licensees are well aware, the Silent Sounds <SUP>tm</SUP> system (U. S. Patent # 5,159,703
and three other Patents Pending) is, MEASURABLY, vastly superior to all other subliminal and brainwave devices
and tapes. An inaudible, high (or low) audio or ultrasonic carrier signal is modulated with the desired intelligence
(voice, command tones, EEG feedback waveforms, Alpha-through-Theta brainwaves or what-have-you). The modulation
technique and carrier frequency are uniquely selected to produce the strongest of all known subliminal signals
at the diaphragm of the ear. This is all accomplished in complete silence (if desired). Unlike any other known
system, the Alpha- through-Theta waveform (ANY waveform...an EEG waveform, for example) can directly frequency
modulate the silent carrier and produce a strong demodulated replica of the original EEG waveform at the diaphragm
of the ear. No other known system, including the audible &quot;beat frequency&quot; system, can make that statement.
The audible &quot;beat&quot; frequency output waveform is always of very low power and is always only a sinewave
(actual brainwaves are NOT sinewaves.).</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The SS signal can be easily detected, recorded or listened to as follows:</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>1. Simply play the suspected tape on your home stereo and, with the Equalizer set at flat (all frequency
settings at mid-position), observe the Equalizer's LCD or LED output indicators. If a strong signal appears at
the highest (or lowest) indicator position, even during periods of music silence, you have a tape that has, indeed,
possibly tested SS positive!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>2. Set the Equalizer's highest frequency control (usually marked 16 KHz) full on and all others full
off. Carefully listen for the voice message at the speaker output with a device such as Radio Shack's Stereo Amplified
Listener (Part No. 33-1093). If the pirate has recorded very low frequencies such as Alpha- through-Theta, you
can observe the amplitude undulations of the LCD's (if below approximately 8 cps). If the low frequency is higher
than that, connect an oscilloscope to the output and you can synchronize on and observe the low frequency output
for closer study.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>We have some rather extraordinary and sophisticated electronic instruments and test equipment here in
our laboratories, and in the labs of some of our licensees, which permits us to really take a signal apart, cycle
by cycle, for analysis. In future newsletters, we will be putting various commercial tape products under our microscope
and privately reporting our certified results and opinions to our licensees.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>As an example, for your information or for your obsolete technique-bashing use, the following tests
were performed under controlled conditions, in the acoustic laboratories of what is, without a doubt, the finest
engineering college in the world today. Ten tape samples were tested in each category and all demodulated output
readings are referenced to 0.0002 microbars. Only members of the university laboratory were involved in any way
with these tests.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>In closing this issue of the newsletter, let me extend my sincerest sympathies to the family of Norman
Cousins, who passed away in December at age 75. He was a close friend of ours and of this entire industry. He will
be sorely missed by all of us who worked with him or who had the pleasure of knowing him.</STRONG>
