Ultrasonic hearing has been found capable of supporting frequency discrimination and speech detection in normal
and older hearing-impaired and profoundly deaf human subjects. When speech signals are modulated into the ultrasonic
range, listening to words results in the clear perception of the speech stimuli and not a sense of high-frequency
vibration. These data indicate that ultrasonic hearing has potential as a communications channel in the rehabilitation
of hearing disorders as well as in many other applications.</H2>

<H3><STRONG>The upper range of human air conduction hearing is believed to be no higher than about 24,000 Hz (1);
nevertheless, there have been reports of humans hearing well into the ultrasonic range but only when the ultrasonic
stimuli are delivered by bone conduction (2-4). Furthermore, ultrasonic bone conduction hearing in humans has been
readily demonstrated in various conditions of auditory pathology, including sensorineural hearing loss and middle
ear disorders (2). Ultrasonic stimulation of the skull with frequencies up to 108 kHz induces a perception of sound
within the head without any sensation of cutaneous feeling (2-4), suggesting that these high frequencies are being
processed in a modality other than the vibratory-somatosensory system.</STRONG></H3>
<P><STRONG>In contrast to the excellent frequency discrimination found in the midsonic auditory range, ultrasonic
perception has been described as having poor frequency-resolving ability (3). This interpretation originates from
reports that the pitch elicited by ultrasonic stimulation is similar to the pitch of the highest air conduction
frequency detectable, that is 8 to 16 kHz (4). Because the perceived pitch of ultrasonic tones was associated with
the upper limit of conventional air conduction hearing, these investigators assumed that the perceived audible
sensation produced by ultrasonic stimuli consisted only of fixed pitch with monotonal quality. In addition, it
was assumed that ultrasonic detection was a by-product of some form of cochlear processing that activated sensorineural
elements within the classical auditory system (4) and, as such, offered little in the form of an additional communication
channel.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>We have tried to determine whether these early investigators might have overlooked the possibility that
ultrasonic frequency discrimination exists and that ultrasonic hearing may, as a consequence, be capable of serving
as a viable alternative communication channel, particularly for individuals with varying degrees of hearing loss.
To explore this possibility, we obtained audiometric and ultrasonic thresholds (4,000 to 90,000 Hz) from ten normal,
young adults (N1)(19 to 26 years of age) (5). Standard audiometric testing revealed that these subjects had normal
hearing (see Fig. 1A), and ultrasonic testing confirmed early reports that humans could perceive ultrasonic stimuli
at least as high as 90,000 Hz (see Fig. 1B). Thresholds for tonal detection in the ultrasonic range ranged from
82 to 112 dB of acceleration depending on the stimulus frequency. When these same subjects were presented with
a stimulus approximately 30 dB above threshold, they reported the tone as being loud and unpleasant.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>We next sought to determine the ability of humans to resolve frequency in the ultrasonic range, using
a paradigm in which ten additional normal, young adult subjects (N2)(23 to 25 years of age) were required to indicate
just noticeable differences (JNDs) in pitch to tonal stimuli of 6, 11, 2, 32, and 40 kHz (7). The subjects were
able to discriminate changes in frequency, although there was a steady increase in the JNDs from 2 to 40 kHz (Fig.
1C). In the auditory range the JNDs ranged from 0.4 to 1.0% of the stimulus frequency, whereas in the ultrasonic
range the JNDs were on the order of 10% of the stimulus frequency. These data reinforce the premise that pitch
discrimination does occur in the ultrasonic range but that frequency discrimination in the ultrasonic range differs
from that in the more conventional auditory range.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The confirmed presence of frequency discrimination raises the possibility that ultrasonic hearing may
support the more complex temporal and spectral discrimination necessary for rudimentary speech perception. In order
to determine ultrasonic speech recognition, eight additional normal, young adults (N3) (20 to 29 years of age)
served as listeners when words were completely modulated into the ultrasonic range. In translating the speech signals
into the ultrasonic range, we used an amplitude modulation, suppressed carrier (double side band modulation) technique
with carrier frequencies of 28 and 40 kHz. The carrier frequency was suppressed such that the audio speech signal
was carried on the two side bands. With modulation just below multiplication distortion, real-time spectral analysis
revealed no audio frequency contamination either when the vibrator was held near the ear and was not mass loaded
or when it was mass loaded by being placed on the mastoid region of the skull (8) (see also Fig. 2B). When the
vibrator was placed in contact with the skull, the signal was clearly perceived as speech. The temporal quality
was well preserved such that syllables could be clearly and accurately counted. In order to quantify speech recognition,
the same eight subjects were given an abbreviated version of the Word Intelligibility by Picture Identification
(WIPI) Test, a closed-set, picture identification task (9). Each word was presented in the ultrasonic range, and
the listeners were instructed to point to the correct one of six pictures. Speech stimuli were presented in blocks
of ten words using each carrier for an equal number of trials. Mean recognition scores of 83% correct (with a range
of 70 to 90%) were observed for both carrier frequencies. These results were well above the chance level of 16%.
One subject returned 2 months after testing and repeated her performance of 88% on another word test.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>We next sought to determine if individuals with impaired high frequency hearing could detect ultrasonic
speech. Ten older subjects (50 to 82 years of age) (N4) were given complete audiograms [as in (5)], including ultrasonic
testing, and these threshold data were compared to those previously generated in normal, young adults. At frequencies
between 1,000 and 10,000 Hz, all older subjects exhibited substantial hearing loss typical of age-related deafness
(Fig. 1A). However, both subject groups displayed similar ultrasonic thresholds regardless of age or hearing loss
in the conventional auditory range (Fig. 1B) These data confirm the ability of human subjects to detect sounds
in the ultrasonic range despite a significant hearing loss normally associated with aging (2). Furthermore, in
a subsequent experiment with five additional subjects with age-related hearing loss (55 to 75 years of age) (N5),
speech stimuli were amplitude-modulated onto a 28-kHz carrier frequency and presented in a single-word, oral-response
discrimination task (10). Mean accuracy was found to be 58% with a range of 45 to 70%. All of the subjects discriminated
words at a level considerably better than chance. The lower scores for the older group relative to the young group
were due to incorrect identification of a single consonant sound within the target word.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Encouraged by the observation that individuals with moderate sensorineural hearing loss were able to
accurately hear isolated words, we next sought to evaluate ultrasonic speech perception in nine subjects with acquired
sensorineural deafness having left corner audiograms with pured tone average hearing of 90+ dB [experiment performed
as in (5)]. All nine subjects detected ultrasonic tones with thresholds of approximately 100 to 130 dB, slightly
higher than those observed in normal, young adults (N3) (Fig. 1B). When the WIPI testing paradigm (9) was administered
to two of these deaf subjects who displayed oral communicative skills, accuracy levels of 20 to 30% were observed.
These scores were lower than those observed for the normal, young adults and may be due to the relative differences
in amplitude by which the WIPI was presented to the two groups. In the normal, young adults, the words were presented
approximately 10 to 15 dB above the respective threshold levels for this group. However, because the threshold
for the deaf subjects were higher than for the normal subjects were higher than for the normal subjects and approached
the power output limits of our equipment, the words were presented only slightly above the threshold levels for
these subjects. Confirmation of this hypothesis must await modification to our equipment, enabling us to increase
the power output.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>In an effort to make the speech material more intelligible, the lower side band was suppressed by 40
dB (8) and three deaf subjects were retested with the same word paradigm. These subjects reported that the upper
side band modulation sounded &quot;better,&quot; which was reflected in scores of 40% identification for each subject.
An analysis of the errors in speech recognition for the deaf subjects yielded the same proportional consonant confusion
profiles as those seen for the normal subjects. Seventy percent of the errors made by the normal subjects and 72%
of the errors made by the deaf subjects were similar consonant substitutions, suggesting that both groups used
the same speech recognition strategies while hearing words in the ultrasonic range.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>As previously observed (3,4), humans have ultrasonic hearing. The present results suggest that some
neural substrate is capable of encoding speech signals when these speech signals are modulated into the ultrasonic
frequencies. This is true in the normal hearing individual, the older listener with compromised auditory function,
as well as in the profoundly deaf person with no substantial auditory function.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Although the specific neural substrates for this ultrasonic processing remain to be elucidated, several
hypotheses can be considered. First, it is possible that ultrasonic frequencies are not transmitted by the middle
ear because of a poor impedance match) but are transmitted by the bone and then are coded like high-frequency,
air-conducted sounds at the base of the cochlea where the signal is then transmitted to the brain via the classical
auditory pathways (2, 4, 11). Although more data must be generated to fully evaluate this hypothesis, the ability
of the older hearing-impaired and the clinically deaf to detect ultrasonic sound and to perceive speech would argue
against such a hypothesis.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Alternatively, it is possible that an ultrasonic receptor resides within a known structure to which
we presently ascribe a different function. One possible candidate for such ultrasonic reception is the saccule,
an otolithic organ that responds to acceleration and gravity and may be responsible for transduction of sound after
destruction of the cochlea (12). Anatomically, it has been reported that saccular afferents in mammals innervate
the classical auditory system at the level of the cochlear nucleus, the first synapse in this pathway (13). In
addition, a saccular nerve branch has been reported to innervate the base (high-frequency portion) of the cochlea,
and a branch of the cochlear nerve has been reported to innervate the saccule, suggesting a reciprocal interdependence
between these two organs (14). The present results in hearing-impaired and profoundly deaf subjects strongly suggest
that bone-conducted, ultrasonic stimulation may provide an alternative therapeutic approach for the rehabilitation
of severe hearing loss.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>5. We administered tonal audiograms to ten young adults (N1) aged 19 to 26 with normal hearing and no
history of ear disease, using a vibratory system that results in bone conduction hearing. A Wilcoxon (Rockville,
MD) F3/F9 electromagnetic piezoelectric vibrator was applied to the mastoid region of the skull. Acceleration was
measured from built-in as well as attached sensors. We measured acceleration in decibels using a Quest (Okanawac,
WI) vibration meter references to 10-3 m/s2. An acceleration value of 10-3 m/s2 is 80 dB below one unit of gravity
(1g). W assessed signal purity using a Hewlett-Packard real-time special analyzer. See Fig. 2A for an example of
spectral analysis performed at 30 kHz.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>6. Subjects were administered an auditory pattern task in which they were required to detect rising
or falling audio tones by means of a convential (clinical) vibrator affixed to the skull (Radio Ear model 32B).
Tones were shifted from 2000 to 4000 Hz or from 4000 to 2000 Hz in 10-ms sweeps. Subjects were instructed to identify
shift direction as either rising or falling. Ultrasonic auditory patterns were delivered to the F9 piezoelectric
vibrator, and frequencies were shifted from either 25 to 32 kHz or from 32 to 25 kHz in 100-ms sweeps. Subjects
were again instructed to identify sweep direction. Signal purity was monitored by fast Fourier transfer analysis,
which revealed no energy 60 dB down from the peak frequencies. There was no energy above or below the frequency
range of 25 to 32 kHz.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>7. Continuous pure tones of 6, 11.2, 32, and 40 kHz were presented to the skull by the F3/F9 vibrator.
Tones were monitored in intensity by means of the Quest vibration meter with octave filtering, and tonal purity
was monitored with real-time fast Fourier analysis analysis. Tones were delivered at a comfortable listening level,
which varied in acceleration from 70 to 100 dB depending on the frequency administered. Subjects were instructed
to indicate a JND in pitch when the experimenter increased frequency rate over 5 s. A frequency counter was used
to measure the frequency that elicited a JND in pitch. An average of three trials was obtained per subject.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>8. Live voice speech (300 to 3000 Hz) was delivered through a microphone, amplified, and translated
into the ultrasonic range. The carrier frequencies used were 28 and 40 kHz. The double side band (DSB) carrier-suppressed
signal was filtered with a Kron-Hite model 3750 filter set in high-pass mode with a cutoff frequency of 20 kHz
and a slope of 24 dB per octave. This filtered signal was delivered through the Wilcoxon Research model PA7C power
amplifier and the model N9 matching network to the model F9 piezoelectric vibration generator on a model Z9 transducer
base. The accelerometer output of the transducer was used as input to the Quest Electronics measurement instrument,
and signal levels were determined. The accelerometer output was also sent to the Hewlett-Packard model 3561A dynamic
signal analyzer, allowing the spectral content of the ultrasonic, bone conduction speech signal to be analyzed
and monitored. A DSB signal is generated by the multiplication of two input signals, one modulating (audio) signal
and one carrier (high-frequency) signal, using a balanced modulator. An upper side band signal was generated by
phasing method such that both the audio and the carrier were shifted by 90 deg., fed into each of two balanced
modulators, and summed [F. G. Stremler, An Introduction to Communication Systems (Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA,
1982)].</STRONG></P>

the pictures in the appropriate matrix and make a verbal response. Ten words were delivered per trial, and the
number of correct responses was recorded so that the types of errors could be identified. Normal subjects were
asked to perform one trial for each of the carrier frequencies.</STRONG></P>

balanced words to five older (55 to 75 years of age) subjects using the F9 piezoelectric vibrator. A forced choice
paradigm was used such that only a totally correct word was counted and there was no partial credit for individual
phoneme recognition. 11. K. Obyama et al., Hear. Res. 17, 143 (1985); K Ohyama et al.., Acta Oto-Laryngol. Suppl.
