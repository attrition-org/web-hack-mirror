what is a Silent Sound?<IMG SRC="gold2t.gif" WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="95" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" ALIGN="ABSBOTTOM"></H1>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="gline3.gif" WIDTH="511" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">
<H3>Simply stated, the phrase Silent Sounds <SUP>(tm)</SUP> is the trademark of a patented group of technologies,
recently unclassified, that collectively have the ability to very effectively (and SILENTLY!)(and MEASUREABLY)
communicate with the human brain...in a language the brain clearly understands... be it voice, music, data trains,
mantras, frequency patterns, etc. The phenomena occurs in total silence and on clear, uncluttered channels of communication.
The basic techniques are similar to those used in FM radios, satellite links, computer modems, and soon, hearing
aids for the profoundly deaf! As you will soon appreciate, for example,on &quot;The Irrefutable Proof&quot; page,
it will be shown that the system permits people who have totally disfunctional middle and inner ears to now clearly
hear and understand another human being's voice! As you can imagine, the results are traumatic, as well as extremely
joyful!</H3>
<P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="gline3.gif" WIDTH="511" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"> <BR>
<BR>
The specially embedded silent communications are transmitted on those inaudible frequency channels located just
above and just below a human being's audible frequency range. This feature permits the Silent Sounds (tm) to be
recorded on such media as audio tapes, Compact Discs, motion picture sound tracks or propagated directly through
loudspeakers and earphones or over such systems as FM radios and TV sets. They are very effective, for example,
when transmitted over retail store announcement systems, continuously repeating the &quot;Don't Steal&quot; messages!</P>
<P>Very special and uniquely designed recording and monitoring systems are required to insure the system's effectiveness.
In actual applications, a great number of enhancements are required, such as... simultaneous FM/AM modulation,
specially tailored RF compression, carefully selected carrier frequencies and a very unique and patented &quot;audio
shaping&quot; enhancement circuit. The latter is necessary because the complex demodulation process [simultaneously
involving cutaneous (skin) sensing, Corti (inner ear) slope detection and neural network decoding] results collectively
in a very &quot;nonlinear&quot; (distorted) demodulated output to the brain. Without &quot;re-linearization and
audio shaping&quot;, for example, the word &quot;Hello&quot; sounds like &quot;Whulla&quot; to a profoundly deaf
person! And, to your cortex!</P>
<P>A great deal of research and testing were required to solve this problem. As an over -simplification, let us
say that, basically, we distorted the sound of &quot;Hello&quot; to sound like &quot;Whulla&quot; and......well,
what do you know!....the profoundly deaf person now hears the word clearly as &quot;Hello&quot;. Establishing the
necessary &quot;audio shaping&quot; circuits involved testing over one hundred adult, profoundly deaf people. All
of these adults had formerly possessed normal hearing and knew the the proper sounding of the word &quot;Hello&quot;.</P>
