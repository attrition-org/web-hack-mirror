On Tour <IMG SRC="pearl2rt.gif" WIDTH="70" HEIGHT="79" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"></H1>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="gline.gif" WIDTH="511" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"> <BR>
<IMG SRC="baez8.gif" WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="202" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" HSPACE="15" VSPACE="15">
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">If Joan Baez has a lower profile these days, it's probably because she's given up her firebrand
political activism, which dates back to the '60's civil rights marches and protests against the Vietnam War. She
now lets her singing, rather than her anger, be her guide.</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;I was never a screaming mainstream event anyway,&quot; Baez says, &quot;But I was a screaming
counter-cultural event.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">A calmer, more serene Baez -- who grew up in Belmont, Mass., and was a local coffeehouse queen
long before touring with the likes of Bob Dylan -- made a conscious decision to cut back her leftist politics a
few years ago.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;I felt I had to stop the activism for this period. There just wasn't enough energy for
it,&quot; says Baez. &quot;It was scary, but because it was scary, I knew it was the right thing to do.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Baez, who now lives in northern California, has instead devoted her nonmusical time to improving
her personal stability. Not everyone knew she had been hampered by phobias during her career, but she owns up to
them now.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="baez2.gif" WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="256" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" HSPACE="15" VSPACE="15">&quot;I've
done the inner work and have since dumped the phobias -- the fear of flying and the insomnia,&quot; she says during
a recent interview from the road. &quot;It's just gone.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">A New Age Baez credits yoga, breathing techniques, better diet <EM>and the use of relaxation
tapes for her turnaround.</EM><BR>
&quot;You can plant things into your psyche,&quot; she says, &quot;but not until you slow things down and listen.
<EM>For me, it's the power of suggestion. It's like autohypnosis. I now have tapes for just about everything. If
I'm feeling inadequate, I have a tape for that. If I feel I'm going to make a bunch of blunders, I have one for
that.</EM>&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Baez has become a great believer in visualization. She imagines scenes in her mind, then acts
them out. &quot;I heard the golfer Arnold Palmer did that. So I began to do it too. It's very exciting. For me,
if there's a song that has a high note in it, I first visualize the song and see my hand gestures and everything.
And it's almost as if I go on remote control when I do it for real.&quot;<BR>
<EM>Her new calmness has put her in a &quot;comfort zone&quot; on her latest tour.</EM></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;I'm feeling very joyous,&quot; she says. &quot;I don't even use a set list. I have a big
enough repertoire so that I can choose from it to suit the evening and the place.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Baez is touring to support an inspired live album. &quot;Ring Them Bells,&quot; recorded last
year at the Bottom Line club in New York City. It contains delightful duets with such artists as Mary Chapin Carpenter
(on &quot;Diamonds and Rust,&quot; Baez's biggest hit), Tish Hinojosa, Mary Black, Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle,
Dar Williams and the Indigo Girls (on Dylan's &quot;Don't Think Twice, It's All Right,&quot; which Baez and the
Indigos also did together at last summer's Newport Folk Festival).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The album has another Dylan cover song as well. It's the title track, &quot;Ring Them Bells,&quot;
with its poignant verse: &quot;Ring them bells for all of us that are left.&quot; Says Baez, who toured with Dylan
on the latter's &quot;Rolling Thunder Revue&quot; in the mid-70's: &quot;I don't see Bob much anymore, but I ran
into him twice at festivals in recent years. We had a friendly chat.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Her album even has a live version of the first song she ever wrote, &quot;Sir Galahad.&quot;
She adds: &quot;I didn't write that until I was 10 years into (performing). I always considered songwriting a secondary
gift for me, though I think I've written a few songs that will last. But my voice has been my primary gift.&quot;</P>
