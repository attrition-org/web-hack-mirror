<H2>HIGH TECH PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE ARRIVES IN THE MIDDLE EAST</H2>

<H2>DHAHRAN, SAUDI ARABIA (March 23)--Sources in Dhahran today revealed what might have been the true reason for
the seemingly illogical and apparently suicidal attack by Iraqi troops on the deserted city of Al-Khafji, located
just 12 miles south of the Kuwaiti border. The report indicates that the top priority objective of the Iraqi strike
across the border was a successful attempt to destroy a small, portable FM radio station that had been installed
on the roof of the tallest building in the town of Al-Khafji by the U. S. Defense Department's PsyOps Branch.</H2>
<P>
<H3>With the destruction of Saddam Hussein's military command and control system, communications with Iraqi troops
in Kuwait are now largely carried out in a very primitive manner by utilizing Iraq's commercial FM radio stations
located in the small Iraqi towns adjacent to Kuwait's western border. Military orders are encoded and then transmitted
by Baghdad's military FM radio station YIHS. These signals are received and re-broadcast, in turn, by designated
FM stations located between Baghdad and the Kuwaiti border until the programming arrives at the designated &quot;control&quot;
station of the day which then broadcasts directly to the troops in Kuwait on exactly 100.00 MHz (megahertz), which
is continuously monitored by all.</H3>
<P>In order to nullify this Iraqi military line of communications (LOC), the U. S. PsyOps organization attached
to the U. S. Central Command in Dhahran installed a portable FM broadcast transmitter, a gasoline-electric generator
and a continuous tape recording system on top of the tallest building in the deserted city of Al-Khafji. The station
transmitted on 100.00 MHz and its power output was adjusted to cover up the transmission of the Iraqi station operating
on exactly the same frequency.</P>
<P>The clandestine station programming consisted of patriotic and religious music and intentionally vague, confusing
and contradictory military orders and information to the Iraqi soldiers in the Kuwaiti Theater of Command (KTO).
The size and power of enemy forces was always intentionally exaggerated. Surrender was encouraged.</P>
<P>According to statements made by captured and deserting Iraqi soldiers, however, <EM>the most devastating and
demoralizing programming was the first know military use of the new, high tech, type of subliminal messages referred
to as ultra-high-frequency &quot;Silent Sounds&quot; or &quot;Silent Subliminals&quot;. (See Newsweek, July 30,
1990, Page 61.)</EM> Although completely silent to the human ear, the negative voice messages placed on the tapes
alongside the audible programming by PsyOps psychologists were clearly perceived by the subconscious minds of the
Iraqi soldiers and the silent messages completely demoralized them and instilled a perpetual feeling of fear and
hopelessness in their minds. It was necessary for the Iraqi tank commanders or another crew member to listen to
the FM station 24 hours each day for quickly changing deployment orders. They were being exposed to the &quot;Silent
Sounds&quot; during the same listening periods.</P>
<P>The same Dhahran source indicates that the Al-Khafji station has now been repaired and is now back in full operation.</P>

RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA (March 26)--Around Riyadh, the uninitiated called it the &quot;Black Hole.&quot; A large but
dingy basement storage room at the headquarters of the Royal Saudi Air Force has been turned over to the American
Air Force, and it was so secret that even officers with top security clearance couldn't get inside. Within the
space allotted him, Brig. Gen. Buster C. Glosson built a maze of small offices in order to plot the air war against
Iraq.</P>
<P>In one set of cubicles, officers pondered how to eliminate Saddam Hussein's nuclear weapons, his chemical and
biological plants, his missile-production factories. In a second, they concentrated on the Republican Guard, its
artillery and tanks dug in along Iraq's border with Kuwait. <EM>In the third, they planned and implemented an unbelievable
and highly classified PsyOps program utilizing &quot;silent sound&quot; techniques.</EM> In a fourth, they studied
targets of opportunity in Kuwait itself. From throughout the American military, Glosson recruited intelligence
officers to scout the enemy, logistics people to match weapons to objectives, &quot;fraggers&quot; to pick the
final targets. Everyone was sworn to secrecy; they worked with laptop computers on a special system that could
not be tapped into by anyone else, however high ranking, in the allied Central Command. Glosson ordered a large
sign hung on one wall, lettered by computer printout. It read: The Way Home Is Through Baghdad.</P>
<P>In places like Black Hole, the secret history of the war was played out during the seven anxious months that
began last August. The final victory sprang out of the details--and only now, in the afterglow of success, are
the details beginning to emerge. President Bush, his top military brass and his field commanders kept the war planning
so closely guarded that almost no one, even senior military officers, knows the full scope of what they accomplished.
With much the same skill that they displayed in establishing air superiority over the battlefield, they established
a different sort of supremacy over the media, hiding the risks they took, the mistakes they made and the successful
steps they took to overcome them.</P>
<P>In retrospect, the steady beat of coalition successes made the victory over Saddam Hussein look almost easy.
The untold history of the war, however, is a chronicle of tight spots and alarming surprises, of stratagems devised
to outwit a foe who was consistently given more credit for more strength and more determination than he ultimately
displayed. &quot;Special operations&quot; spies sneak into Iraq and Kuwait, darting around the desert in dune buggies
at night, helping to locate Scud batteries and other targets, even filching electronics from Iraqi antiaircraft
sites for study by coalition experts in Riyadh. The allied air command........<snip>......</P>
