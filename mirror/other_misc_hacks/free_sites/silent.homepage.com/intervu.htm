<P><B><STRONG>ABSTRACT: A first look at the new, and recently declassified, &quot;Silent Sound&quot; system for
producing silent Subliminal Audio Tapes and High Frequency/Ultrasonic Equipment and Tapes for the Profoundly Deaf
and Hearing-Impaired which has finally eliminated the deficiencies in the previously claimed subliminal recording
methods and their attendant advertising claims by now providing a technology with certifiable measurements and
actual hearing performance. The system features the new and unique (U. S. Patent #5,159,703) application of modern
modulation and demodulation techniques and frequencies and, in the hearing enhancement application, is additionally
capable of bypassing the outer and middle ear and successfully transmits directly via cartilage, calcification
and/or bone conduction to the neural networks of the brain. The new process is also being successfully applied
to the fields of music, the movies and to the new &quot;brainware&quot; products now coming into the market. Our
interest today concerns the new silent subliminal tape application.</STRONG></B></P>

<P><B><STRONG>BTR: Dr. Thompson, would you please explain to our venture capital subscribers the old subliminal
recording methods and the need for a recording method that is scientifically measurable and acceptable to the needs
of the subliminal tape users, to the medical professional and to government agencies.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>CT: Of course, Charles. But first, if I may, let me very briefly explain the subliminal science and
how it functions. In the interest of brevity, I will give you an abbreviated and simplified explanation:</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>All human beings are endowed with a conscious mind and a subconscious mind. The subconscious mind
tends to the vast number of automatic functions required by the body, such as heartbeat, breathing, body temperature,
blood pressure, health, sleep, etc. And it also performs many other very important functions, some known and some
not yet discovered, which make man quite different from all other animals.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>The subconscious mind remembers or stores, like a computer's memory, all of the facts, pictures,
observations, beliefs and algorithms that man or woman has experienced or has been taught during his or her life.
These facts not only provide this person with the memories of his past life experiences but also provides him with
the &quot;knowledge&quot; his conscious mind needs in order to make second to second decisions concerning that
person's present and future mental and physical actions. You know that two plus two is equal to four because you
were taught that in school. You know that you do not touch a hot stove because, early in life, your mother told
you not to or you discovered all by yourself that touching a hot stove is not a wise thing to do.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>During the early, and most formative, years of a person's life, it has been estimated that a child
receives approximately twenty negative &quot;rules&quot; for every positive one. &quot;Don't go out in the rain.&quot;
&quot;Stop making noise and go to sleep.&quot; &quot;Wipe the mud off your shoes.&quot; &quot;Be quiet.&quot; &quot;Do
not go outside&quot;. The same negative environment follows you through school and early job training. Most of
these &quot;rules&quot; combine in the subconscious mind to provide a person with a data bank that generally permits
him to make &quot;cautious&quot;, &quot;safe&quot; and therefore &quot;wise&quot; decisions throughout his or her
life. At times, however, the accumulated &quot;rules&quot; tell him that it is &quot;OK to smoke tobacco&quot;
or that &quot;he should not try something new because there is the possibility that he might fail&quot; or that
he &quot;doesn't have a very positive image of himself&quot;, etc. Decades of experience, psychological counseling,
hypnosis, etc., have shown that a person can reprogram his or her mind and thereby change his or her beliefs and
values.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>The difficult psychological trick, however, is to reprogram the subconscious mind in a manner that
does not allow the conscious mind to evaluate the new information (and therefore reject it because the new ideas
are not in agreement with the existing information that is stored in the subconscious mind). The subconscious mind
accepts new rules and facts without question and without judgment; the conscious mind, however, insists on making
judgments based on previously held ideas before it accepts new and conflicting facts and ideas.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>BTR: Then, the task of the subliminal message delivery mechanism is to somehow bypass the conscious
mind and, yet, present new information to the subconscious mind?</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>CT: Exactly. In 1969, an attempt was made to hide (from the conscious mind) subliminal messages on
an ordinary audio magnetic tape. The attempted method was simple; the voice or message was mixed with and buried
under a louder program such as music, sounds of nature or even other voices. The hope was that the human subconscious
mind might somehow be able to mentally peel away the louder sounds and hear the buried messages, without interference
from or rejection by the conscious mind. The practical motivation was that, if this could be made to work, the
successful method of bypassing the conscious mind was now at hand.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>BTR: Then, Dr. Thompson, that solved the problem? The buried message technique worked and a new and
successful subliminal tape industry was created?</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>CT: Well, indeed a new subliminal tape industry was created but the basic problem was not solved.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>BTR: What do you mean?</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>CT: Simply that the present buried or masked subliminal tape technique does not work and never has
worked as claimed. Intuitive logic tells you that it does not work and the scientific community can prove to you
that it could not possible work as presently implemented. The up front problem with the present buried or masked
subliminal tape technique is that it is impossible to detect the presence of the buried voice message, either with
the human mind or with the world's most sophisticated scientific instrumentation. Simply ask any accredited medical
school or the data transmission or communications department of any accredited university or college anywhere in
the world. Any suggested success with the buried voice technique is purely placeboic.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>We cannot extract the voice messages from the music. Neither can any other accredited university
research organization, to our knowledge. The National Institute of Health cannot make it work. It does not work
for the U.S. Department of Defense nor any of the military services. The American Psychological Association cannot
make it work. It does not work for the American Psychiatric Association. Nor does it work for the U.S. Army Psychological
Warfare Center. NASA has had no luck with it either. The Federal Trade Commission cannot make it work. Consumer's
Report Magazine will not even accept today's buried subliminal tapes for testing.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>BTR: Why doesn't it work?</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>CT: No human brain or scientific instrument has yet been able to provably recover, either consciously
or subconsciously, data that has been buried that far down under other &quot;noise&quot; or music. NASA and other
government and international organizations, for example, utilize billions of dollars worth of deep space radio
astronomy equipment and computer enhancement systems to detect and analyze very weak and complex signals from outer
space but they all have been unable to detect or recover messages buried under other sounds on today's subliminal
tapes. The military laboratories and contractors who work with sophisticated signal jamming, electronic countermeasures,
submarine sonar and clandestine surveillance systems can detect and computer enhance periodic waveforms such as
radar and sonar targets quite far down into &quot;noise&quot; but have never been able to detect or recover the
complex, non-periodic, voice messages or other forms of programming buried on today's subliminal tapes.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>Some of today's subliminal tape manufacturers make vague references to scientifically controlled,
&quot;positive proof&quot;, studies that have supposedly been performed in the academia, under repeatable, double
blind test conditions. Ask them for copies of the results of these studies as certified and accepted by accredited,
independent medical, academic or government institutions or professional associations. In all of our medical database
computer searches, even through the entire Library of Congress, we have yet to find a scientifically valid positive
study result. Better yet, mix your voice with a louder passage of music on your tape recorder and ask one of the
buried subliminal tape manufacturers to tell you the contents of the message you recorded on the tape. Don't hold
your breath waiting for an answer. With the new Silent Sounds technique, the &quot;hidden&quot; information can
be easily recovered utilizing very simple equipment.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>BTR: But what about the many favorable, and sometimes miraculous, &quot;testimonials&quot; that are
quoted in the manufacturers' catalogs?</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>CT: Miraculous results and favorable testimonials are often claimed and provided for most products
in today's space age marketplace. When a customer pays his good money for a product, he is not inclined to suggest
that he made a &quot;dumb&quot; buy or that he was &quot;taken&quot;. Our American free enterprise system of product
advertising permits a vast range of editorial freedoms of expression. What has been your personal experience with
product advertising claims of repeatable miracles?</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>Also, remember that one of the most powerful, and medically neglected, therapeutics in the world
is the placebo effect. The &quot;power of believing&quot; is a proven, self-fulfilling medication in itself.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>BTR: All right then, Dr. Thompson, how does this new Silent Sounds recording technique solve all
of these problems and produce a credible and functioning subliminal audio tape?</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>CT: The Silent Sounds system is the only system that we have seen and tested that uses straight forward,
scientific techniques to produce subliminal tapes whose effective outputs can be measured at the human ear. The
developers of this U.S. Patented system have combined a number of proven scientific principles to produce a very
unique and silent method for passing information to the subconscious mind while completely bypassing the conscious
mind.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>As the developers have point out, there is no black magic or voodooism involved. They and their licensees
have repeatedly and publicly challenged the users of all other subliminal tape systems to step forward and permit
the buying public and government regulatory agencies to witness fair and impartial voice signal strength comparisons
by accredited and independent experts of the challenger's choice. My understanding is that there have never been
no takers to this challenge.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>BTR: What basic scientific techniques are used to produce these new audio tapes that make them so
different from today's buried subliminal tapes?</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>CT: On the new Silent Sounds tapes, the voice or other programming is transmitted to the human ear
and to the brain's neural networks on a very high audio frequency or ultrasonic carrier signal which is recorded
on the upper frequency portion of the audio tape, just above the hearing range of most humans. In the hearing-impaired
application, the specially processed AM/FM modulated signal is transmitted directly from the electronic equipment.
In one application, frequency modulation is used to encode the voice signals on the carrier frequency. The FM demodulation
technique, known as slope detection, permits the natural frequency response characteristics of the human ear to
efficiently detect and demodulate the voice signals and strongly vibrate the diaphragm of the ear with these voice
signals. For profoundly deaf people, the demodulation takes place in the brain's neural network. The transmission
and demodulation techniques used here are almost exactly the same as those used by FM radio transmitters and receivers,
cellular telephones, computer modems, mobile radios and satellite and space communication systems. The major differences
are the careful selection of the actual frequencies of transmission.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>The amplitude or strength of the voice signals is recorded in such a manner that the voice cannot
be heard by the conscious mind but is strongly perceived by the subconscious mind. In the hearing-impaired application,
the FM (or AM) modulated signal is made strong enough to reach and excite, say, the hair cells of the inner ear
or is induced directly onto the neural networks of the brain. BTR: In view of the fact that the subliminal voice
signals are silent or ultrasonic, how does the scientific community know that they are present on the tape and
are radiating from the tape player speaker?</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>CT: The silent output signals can be measured with standard sound level meters of the type used by
acoustic engineers. They can also actually be heard by using the small mic/amplifier/earphone units called stereo
amplified listeners available, for example, from Radio Shack stores. These type devices closely duplicate the audio
frequency characteristics of the human ear. The strength of the silent output signals from a tape player speaker
or earphones will typically vary between 65 and 95 decibels depending upon the particular tape player or stereo
system in use. These sound level ranges are the inaudible equivalent to the sound level of a loud orchestra or
to the sound level of a Boeing 747 taking off from an airport runway. Converting the logarithmic scale of the decibel
readings to a linear scale, this is a voice signal strength equivalent of more that 10 million times that produced
at the human ear by the buried subliminal tapes available today. Ask today's buried tape manufacturers if they
disagree with these measurements and can show or calculate different measurement results using scientifically accepted
formulas and measurement techniques.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>BTR: How do you people in the medical research community know that these voice signals arrive at
the human brain?</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>CT: The effects can be immediately seen on electroencephalograms or EEG readings of the brain's activities.
Physiologically, the Silent Sounds voice vibrations are transmitted through the external auditory canal to the
diaphragm of the ear, through the middle and inner ears, to the auditory nerve. The cochlear nerve conducts these
auditory messages through intermediate level neurons in the medial geniculate and the inferior colliculus within
the thalamus. These second-level neurons then transmit to third-level neurons in the primary auditory cortex. Predictable
changes in the EEG readings on the cerebral cortex of the brain's left and right hemispheres are immediately seen.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>BTR: Dr. Thompson, please discuss some of the uses for this new Silent Sounds tape technology.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>CT: Well, one of the immediate and obvious applications for the new technology is as for the immediate
replacement and modernization of today's buried subliminal audio tape techniques. This conversion is taking place
now in the subliminal tape industry. Silent Sounds tapes are becoming available now in both the natural, silent
format and also combined with music and other sounds such as ocean waves. Both formats are equally effective as
the music and the silent voice occupy different portions of the tape's audio frequency range and therefore do not
interfere with or overlap each other. The voice signals are always transmitted on their own, clear channel. Look
for the words &quot;Silent Sounds (tm)&quot; on the tape package.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>The fact that the transmitted voice signals are silent also means that the tapes can now be used
anywhere and anytime, even all night while you sleep. Use them in your car or in your office or in an airplane.
You can play them while you watch TV or listen to the radio or music from your stereo. The silent technique is
also expected to revive the sleep learning industry. The government medical and military organizations have many
other immediate uses for this new technology.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>Musicians are now using the Silent Sounds technique to add silent channels to their recordings which
permits the addition of a &quot;fourth dimension&quot; to their arrangements. They typically add additional musical
instruments, chants, melody or harmony singing voices, etc. It is producing an entirely different type of music.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>Another major new use of the Silent Sounds technology is in the new &quot;brainware&quot; tapes that
are now appearing on the market. Major breakthroughs in our knowledge and understanding of the functioning of the
human mind have taken place in just the past five years. The new CAT and PET diagnostic machines, and now the nuclear
magnetic resonator, NMR, have permitted us to leapfrog ahead in our understanding of the importance of what we
had previously referred to as the placebo effect and also in our understanding of the causes and treatments of
mental illnesses and addictions. The new Silent Sounds technology permits us, for the first time, to transmit the
powerful very low frequency alpha, beta, delta and theta waves to the ear, using present day amplifiers, speakers
and ordinary audio cassette tapes. These Silent Sounds tapes now permit us to achieve, within minutes, what Zen
monks spend thirty or forty years to learn through meditation...hemispheric synchronization of the brain.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>The Silent Sounds technology has been implemented in all of the usual formats, such as audio cassette,
videocassette, Compact Disc, LaserDisc, digital tape recorder (DAT), FM, TV and direct.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>BTR: Well, thank you very much, Dr. Thompson. This has been a most interesting discussion. We appreciate
the time you have spent with us and the information that you have been willing to very kindly provide. Good luck
in your government organization's continuing and successful studies of this very interesting and new technology.</STRONG></B></P>
<P><B><STRONG>CT: It has been my pleasure, Charles, and you can expect to see the published results of research
organizations' studies and the expanding applications of this Silent Sounds technology, including government, medical
and international, in the very near future.</STRONG></B></P>
