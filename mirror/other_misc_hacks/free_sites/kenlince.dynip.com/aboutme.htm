<p align="center"><big><strong><em>ABOUT ME...</em></strong></big></p>

<p align="left"><strong><em>Currently, I am the Director Of Information Systems for NDC,

duties include all network administrative duties on a LAN/WAN which include, NT 4 Servers,
IBM AIX, MS Exchange, MS SQL, MS IIS, MS Terminal Server,Cisco and Ascend Routers and
several proprietary applications.&nbsp; In the past I have worked as a Systems Integrator,
Network Administrator, and even had a stint at consulting with a fortune 100 corporation.</em></strong></p>

<p align="left"><small>I was born in Alton, Illinois on December 31, 1970.&nbsp; My family
moved to Houston, TX when I was 7.&nbsp; My Dad got a teaching job there, so we packed up
and headed south. &nbsp; My Dad is now the Principal for Meyer Elementary School in
Rosenberg, TX.&nbsp; Here is the <a href="http://www.lcisd.org/schools/meyer/default.htm">link</a>
to his schools Homepage. &nbsp; My Mom and baby sister, Katie, live in Katy, TX and my Dad
and Stepmother, Lynne still live in Rosenberg, TX.&nbsp; My other sister Lori lives with
her Husband Kevin and their son Weston in Greatwood, TX.</small></p>

<p align="left"><small>I attended J.F. Dulles High School in Sugar Land, TX.&nbsp; After
graduating,&nbsp; I joined the Navy.&nbsp; While in the Navy, I worked on&nbsp; aircraft
avionics and electronics.&nbsp;&nbsp; While stationed at Miramar Naval Air Station in San
Diego, I got flight deck certified and Plane captain certfied on the E-2/C-2 aircraft. My
highest commendation was the Navy Achievement Medal, which i was awarded for assisting the
implementation of the HAZMAT (Hazardous Waste Materials Program) for my squadron
(VAW-112).&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got out of the Navy I moved back to Texas where I attended <a
href="http://www.ttu.edu">Texas Tech University</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; At Tech, I studied
Industrial Engineering my first 2 years, and then changed my major to MIS (Management of
Information Systems) while I still had my sanity :-)&nbsp; While attending Tech, I
explored my musical avenues a bit more and pretty much paid my way through school playing
in a Top 40 Country Band.&nbsp; The band,&nbsp; &quot;Laredo&quot;, went through many
evolutions - but the crew we had for the last year or so we were together was an absolute
blast.&nbsp; We played some great club gigs and had a big time.&nbsp; The best part about
it all was that I made some friends for life. &nbsp; While I lived in Lubbock, I also met
my Fiancée, Cathy.&nbsp;We met there while performing on the &quot;Cactus
Theatre&quot;.&nbsp; We have been together for about 3 years now.&nbsp; There are some
pictures of Her and I in the <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~kenlince/family.htm">family</a>
pics section.</small></p>

<p align="left"><small>Cathy and I moved to Nashville in September of 97 so that she could
pursue a career in music.&nbsp;Things go slowly here - but she definitely has what it
takes to make it big in this business.&nbsp; So, I'm just hanging out waiting till she
makes the big bucks so I can sit home and watch SportsCenter all day..... :-)</small></p>

<p align="left"><small>I hope you enjoy the site!&nbsp; I have posted a bunch of pictures
of Me and my family and some of my closest friends.&nbsp; I will continually update this
part of the site as I get new material - so Stay Tuned!!</small></p>
