Hi, my name is Mixter. I like to fame off of others' findings.
Here, on my security site, I will show you many examples of my arrogance.
I will include links to certain *exploit* code so my friends...
Wait, did I say friends? Ok, I'm sorry. I have no friends. Sorry guys. 
Since I have no friends and my code sucks, I guess I wont release anything.
But why do I keep punishing myself by posting lame advisories on Bugtraq?
The world may never know...

For my first example, I bring you targa.c.
Targa is a poorly written Denial of Service application which combines
the work of many others into one! Pretty elite eh? :)
This application contains portability problems, poor programming structure,
and even stack-based buffer overrun conditions in automatic data!

Next I show you my 31337 Bugtraq mailing list skills.
I like to comment on others' posts alot, it makes me feel special.
For instance, recently I responded to a post by Thomas Biege regarding to
a local denial-of-service attack in the syslog daemon.
My reply to the list must have made Mr. Biege feel low, but its all cool. :)
Here I turned a simple DoS attack into a kernel issue which in turn was
blown way out of hand and had nothing to do with syslogd.
I just wanted to show off my amount of DoS'ing skill.

Last but not least. I bring you Qualcomm's popper 3.0 exploit!
It seems that I like to "overhear" people on IRC talking about the latest
security vulnerabilities. So what do I do? GO GET EM!
I then write exploit code, advisory information, and POSSIBLY a fix.
Whats next? Well, I post it to Bugtraq and reap the fame!!!
