Here is a an audio tape programthat should be in every school media center! From George Washingtonto Bill Clinton, author Kathleen Krull goes beyond politics and photoops, revealing the complex and very real lives of the forty-oneAmerican presidents to date. Very entertaining, yet alwaysrespectful, Krull peeks into the lives behind the scenes, providinginsightful observations about our famous and infamous leaders,telling how their families, friends, and neighbors saw them. Asauthor Kathleen Krull points out, "We name schools and streets afterour presidents and put their heads on our money. We envision them aslarger-than-life leaders and boast that in America any child canaspire to be one. But what were the presidents really like as humanbeings?" For ages 10 and up. Two cassettes, 3 hours, $17.95. Krull isalso the author of <B>LIVES OF THE ARTISTS</B>, an audio tape programlasting two hours and covering such renowned artists as DaVinci,Michelangelo, Van Gogh, Matisse, Rembrandt, Dali, and Andy Warhol(twenty in all). Another two-hour audio tape program by Krull ,<B>LIVES OF THE WRITERS</B>, depicts the lives of such writers asCarl Sandburg, Louisa May Alcott, Mark Twain, Robert Louis Stevenson,and Shakespeare (twenty in all). <B>LIVES OF THE MUSICIANS</B> isstill another audio tape program in this series.

Jesse Hurlbut, D.D., read byRobert Whitfield. Hurlbut's Story of the Bible has its roots in theold custom of parents telling their children stories from the Bible.One of those parents who kept this custom particularly alive andmeaningful was Dr. Jess Lyman Hurlbut. Like many great works ofliterature, the stories that make up this book were told and retoldinnumerable times before being set down on paper. Hurlbut's Story ofthe Bible contains one hundred sixty-eight stories from the Bible,each one complete in itself, while together combining to form onenarrative. It is the complete Bible story, running from Genesis toRevelation, told in the language of today for both young and oldalike. This digitally-mastered set of thirteen one and one-half hourcassettes is simply outstanding. An excellent way to access themessage of the Bible as you drive in your car, work around the house(or garden), or relax on the porch in your rocking chair. Here aresome quotes from reviewers: "Beautiful in every way; should be inevery Christian home where there are children." (Daniel A. Poling)"The best attempt to retell the Bible story for the young of which Ihave any knowledge." (Robert E. Speer, The Board of Foreign Missionsof the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.)

It wasthat way during the years of Huey's ascendancy in Louisiana politics.No matter what Earl did, he couldn't match Huey. But Earl lived 25years longer than his brother and thus did some of the things thatHuey could not do. He was governor of Louisiana three times. At thetime of his death in 1960 he gave every indication that he wouldreturn for a fourth term. He was one of the great politicalcharacters of this century. "Brilliantly impressionistic.

Read by Walter Zimmerman. In the autumn of 59 A.D., a baldmiddle-aged man set out by ship along the coast of Asia Minor, boundfor Rome and a trial before the Emperor. His name was Paul, a Jew ofTarsus, a Roman by citizenship, a revolutioinary by choice. AuthorErnle Bradford brings to life the man we know as Saint Paul, the 13thapostle and great Christian missionary of the first century. Paul didnot come to his work easily, indeed was a leader of the opposition toChristianity. It took a miracle on the road to Damascus to convincehim that his true master was Jesus. An eloquent biography of a manwho changed history. History enthusiasts will marvel at thedescriptions of Mediterranean sailing vessels of the 1st century andthe precariousness with which sailors of that era put to sea. Endingup in the right harbor in the right port was a more difficult taskthan some may have thought. Too, the Roman ships may have had betterfacilities, the galley for example, than those in which Columbus putto sea some 1400 years later!

A great way to learn about thevoyages of Columbus. His first journey across thousands of miles ofunknown ocean, amid the mutinous grievances and tensions of his crew,was not only one of the most significant achievements of recordedhuman history, but was also a demonstration of Columbus's supremacyas mariner and navigator. For while he had faults and defects whichbrought turmoil to his personal life, "there was no flaw, no darkside to the most outstanding of all his qualities&emdash;hisseamanship." This is the story of Columbus the seaman, told by askilled historian, noted writer, and accomplished navigator who hasactually followed Columbus's original courses under sail. AdmiralMorison underwent in sailing vessels the same hazards of wind andsea. The result was the definitive biography, Admiral of the OceanSea (also available from BLACKSTONE AUDIOBOOKS), which was awarded aPulitzer Prize. (2159) Five 11/2-hour cassettes.
