Reeves<BR>This excellent Pelican book is a part of Pelican's governor's series,which includes The Governors of Alabama, The Governors ofMississippi, The Governors of Tennessee, and The Governors of Texas.This outstanding Louisiana volume presents concise biographicalsketches of each of Louisiana's governors, from Pierred le Moyne,Sieur d'Iberville of the seventeenth century to Mike Foster,Louisiana's present governor. It captions Louisiana's governmentsunder the French, then the Spanish, and finally the Americans.Perhaps one of the strengths of modern Louisiana is the diversity ofcultures reflected in the men who occupied the state's highestpolitical office.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#003300">The book is nicely divided intothe French period (1699-1769), the Spanish period (1766-1803), theTransfer period (1803), the Territorial period (1803-1812), andfinally the State period (1812-present). The sketches capture theamazing careers of Huey Pierce Long who reorganized the governmentalstructure of Louisiana and was a national champion for theredistribution of wealth and perhaps on his way to national politicalfame before he was assassinated; of his brother, Earl Kemp Long, whowas governor three times and certainly one of Louisiana's mostcolorful personalities; and of Jimmy Davis (James Houston Davis)composer of many songs, notably the well known, "You Are MySunshine," among numerous others.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#003300">This easy-to-use reference, andits companion volumes in the series, belong in every school andpublic library, at the least, and in many classrooms where inquiryinto the governorship is underway. 136 pp. 51Ž2 x 81Ž2;Illustrations-Bibliography-Index; SBN: 1-911116-471-0; Price:$18.95.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#003300"><IMG SRC="brpelicanla.gif" ALT="Louisiana Land and People" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=183 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=1 ALIGN=left></FONT><FONT SIZE="+4" COLOR="#003300">Louisiana<BR>The Land and Its People</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#003300"><BR>by Sue Eakin and Manie Culbertson<BR>This Pelican textbook and its accompanying Teacher's Resource Bookare the basic ingredients for a comprehensive study of the greatstate of Louisiana. The resource book is replete with lesson plans,activities, duplicating masters (including outstanding sketches,drawings, and graphics), and a set of superior color transparenciesfor enhancing the lessons. Many of the transparencies are colorfulmaps of Louisiana that will make understanding the State and the dataabout the State  much easier; even fun! The 560-page volume certainlymakes Louisiana culture come alive and provides a comprehensiveoverview of Louisiana history, from the first Indian inhabitantsthrough the Civil War and Reconstruction to modern times. Some 200photographs and illustrations, including 45 maps, complement the textand encourage the reader to delve further into the background ofLouisiana and its people.

Huber<BR>The carnival season in New Orleans starts just after Christmas andcontinues until Lent. Some ninety large-scale tableau balls and morethan fifty street parades highlight the celebration which culminateson Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday) with the elaborate pageant of Rex, thefinal parade in the plush series. In recent years, many of theparades which precede Rex have, themselves, achieved great acclaim,such as the Krewe of Bacchus, the Krewe of Endymion, and the Krewe ofZulu. If you can't be there, then this book brings to life thecolorful pageantry and the pulse and excitement of this annualextravaganza with more than 160 photographs and drawings. Included aswell are reproductions of the elaborate ball invitations, some datingfrom the nineteenth century, and portraits of early carnival kingsand queens. This pictorial history of Mardi Gras in New Orleans is anexcellent supplementary resource for use in any study about Louisianaand makes a coffee-table book of extraordinary interest!</FONT></P><P><A HREF="http://pelicanpub.com/"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000FF"><B>PelicanPublishing Company</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#003300">,P.O.

Behe<BR>Darwinian evolution refuted? If you are one of the many who havelived under the ideas about evolution proclaimed in Biology 101 andelsewhere, perhaps this book is for you. Behe's argument's arethorough and extremely well reasoned. They are the honest views of askilled scientist who has followed the science where it has led him.While it is necessarily complex reading in places, by and large, itis very readable and ultimately fascinating. Highly recommend forteachers and anyone else who is willing to follow the evidencewherever it leads, even if it means we've been teaching the wrongstuff in biology for a long, long time!</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000066">Michael Behe is not a creationist.He believes in the scientific method, and he does not look toreligious dogma for answers to these questions. But he arguespersuasively that biochemical machines must have been designed,either by God, or by some other higher intelligence. For decadesscience has been frustrated, trying to reconcile the astonishingdiscoveries of modern biochemistry to a nineteenth-century theorythat cannot accommodate them. With the publication of Darwin's BlackBox, it is time for scientists to allow themselves to considerexciting new possibilities, and for the rest of us to watchclosely.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000066">The field of biochemistry, begunwhen Watson and Crick discovered the double-helical shape of DNA, hasunlocked the secrets of the cell. There, biochemists haveunexpectedly discovered a world of Lilliputian complexity. As Beheengagingly demonstrates, using the examples of vision, bloodclotting,cellular transport, and more, the biochemical world comprises anarsenal of chemical machines, made up of finely calibrated,interdependent parts. For Darwinian evolution to be true, there musthave been a series of mutations, each of which produced its ownworking machine, that led to the complexity we can now see. The morecomplex and interdependent each machine's parts are shown to be, theharder it is to envision Darwin's gradualistic paths. Behe surveysthe professional science literature and shows that it is completelysilent on the subject, stymied by the elegance of the foundation oflife. Could it be that there is some greater force atwork?</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099"><B>Michael J. Behe</B> isProfessor of Biochemistry at Lehigh University.
