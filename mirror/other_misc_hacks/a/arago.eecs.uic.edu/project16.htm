    color="#346281" size="2" face="Arial">his project explores
    the area of multidirectional interferometry coupled with
    computational tomographic reconstruction. Interferometric tomography,
    can be developed into an important diagnostic tool in flow
    measurements. It can provide various advantages over
    conventional optical techniques including instantaneous
    gross-field capture, nonintrusiveness, high spatial
    resolution, and good detection accuracy. To make
    interferometric tomography practical and to realize its full
    potential in flow measurements, some intrinsic problems that
    appear in practice need to be further investigated; that is,
    instantaneous multidirectional projection recording and
    subsequent accurate data reduction in addition to reliable
    field reconstruction from a partial data set involving
    incomplete projection and restricted angular scanning. In the
    past, Dr. Cha has conducted an investigation of the various subprocesses
    in interferometric tomography. <br>

    proposal is to test and combine all of these subprocesses
    which consist of experimental, theoretical and computational
    techniques. This will allow us to determine the practical application
    feasibility of interferometric tomography. </font></p>
