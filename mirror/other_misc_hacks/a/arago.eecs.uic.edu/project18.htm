    color="#346281" size="2" face="Arial">he immediate goal of
    this project is to develop an understanding of the sensing
    mechanism in a novel ultrathin platinum film conductimetric
    immunosensor, using the model antigen/antibody pair Staphylococcal
    Enterotoxin B antibody/Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B. A unique
    feature of the proposed direct examination is the metal
    sensing electrode being used. It is an ultrathin platinum
    film which forms a discontinuous highly porous layer
    comprised of platinum islands separated by spaces of
    insulator. The dimensions of the metal islands in the film,
    as well as the inter-island spaces, are in the same
    dimensional range as that of antibodies which are immobilized
    on the surface.<br>
    </font><font color="#7B8D3D" size="5" face="ChiselD">T</font><font
    color="#346281" size="2" face="Arial">he protein is bound in
    these spaces so that a mosaic network of metal islands and
    protein is formed. When a binding event occurs a change in
    film conductivity is observed which is a direct transduction of
    the binding processes. The immunosensor comprises an
    ultrathin layer of platinum on an insulating substrate of
    silicon dioxide (or silicon nitride) coated on a silicon
    wafer. An antibody is covalently immobilized on the silicon
    dioxide surface.<br>
    </font><font color="#7B8D3D" size="5" face="ChiselD">C</font><font
    color="#346281" size="2" face="Arial">onnections are made to
    the sensor for conductivity measurements through platinum
    contact pads spaced 1.3 mm apart. The structure of the
    ultrathin metal film has been observed by transmission electron
    microscope(TEM), and atomic force microscope (AFM).<br>
    </font><font color="#7B8D3D" size="5" face="ChiselD">W</font><font
    color="#346281" size="2" face="Arial">e are investigating the
    factors that determine sensor performance, including
    sensitivity, specificity, and stability. We want to develop
    an understanding of the sensing mechanism in order to design improved
    sensors. The success of the sensor in responding to
    antibody-antigen binding depends on two factors: (1) the
    ultrathin platinum film structure, and (2) the immobilization
    of the antibody. In order to determine the role of the film
    morphology, a series of different island spacings and
    different noble metals on different substrates will be made.
    The film morphology can be controlled through deposition conditions,
    in order to tailor make the dimensions of the sensor for a
    given antibody size (Esfahani et al,92). Our initial work has
    been with polyclonal anti-staphylococcal enterotoxin B
    (anti-SEB) and we will continue to use this as a model
    system. Many techniques have been developed for
    immobilization of antibodies in liquid phase affinity
    chromatography. They typically result in approximately 20% of
    the immobilized antibodies being viable and active.
    Immobilization schemes that maintain a high degree of antibody
    activity and optimize the transduction of the binding event
    will be studied to develop sensors with high sensitivity and stability.
    To the best of our knowledge our group has reported the first
    work with an impedance based ultrathin metal film biosensor.</font></p>
