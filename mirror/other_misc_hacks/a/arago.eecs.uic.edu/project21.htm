    color="#346281" size="2" face="Arial">his project examines
    localized repair welding as an alternative way to prolong the
    life of these steam rotors rather than complete replacement
    of the unit. This project looks at process optimization of
    the weld process as well as service stability of the complete
    weldment when exposed to elevated temperatures. A new
    alternative filler metal was obtained that outperforms the
    rotor material. In addition modeling work is presently
    underway to predict the remaining life of the repaired unit
    and define parameters to restrict the service variables if
    needed.</font></p>

    color="#346281" size="2" face="Arial">ngineering ceramics are
    finding increasing applications in the development of highly
    efficient, light and compact units in the manufacturing of
    motors and turbines. Improved efficiencies imply high service
    temperatures, which ceramic materials are most likely to withstand.
    There is a need to develop ceramic/ceramic and ceramic/metal
    joints to perform at temperatures of about 800 <sup>o</sup>C
    and in corrosive environments. This investigation is
    methodically testing a number of filler metals in terms on interfacial
    reactions, bonding capability, mechanical properties and
    oxidation resistance. Non-oxide and oxide ceramics are being
    tested.</font></p>
