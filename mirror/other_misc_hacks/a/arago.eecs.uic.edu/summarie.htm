processing and fiber optic technology to precision manufacturing.
This hybrid technology has given us the capability to generate
three dimensional patterns and will create 0.5 cc and larger
objects consisting of metals, semiconductors, polymers, and
insulators with micron accuracy. The advantages offered are: the
miniaturization of existing analytical instruments, the
development of new instruments, and improved control of critical
process variables (down to a micron scale from a mm scale). Areas
of research include miniaturization of low and medium voltage
scanning electron microscopes, linear accelerators and
undulators, field emission electron sources, and
microelectromechanical devices. Miniature analytical instruments
can be brought to previously inaccessible samples. These
instruments will be easier to use since each critical component,
such as charged particle sources, lenses, deflectors, and
detectors will be permanently aligned to the optical axis.</font></p>

microsystems. Bulk silicon micromachining is currently used for
the manufacture of pressure sensors and microaccelerometers. It
is anticipated that the use of this technology will grow in
non-electronic applications, particularly in manufacturing.
Systematic characterization of the micromachining process is
being undertaken with single crystal silicon spheres for the
fabrication of 3-dimensional microstructures. Applications
include high aspect ratio structures for x-ray optics,
micropumps, microvalves and microfluidic devices.<br>
Current funded projects include investigation of an
immunobiosensor for the detection of a bacterial food toxin. This
sensor is based on impedance measurements, making it a less
expensive method than those currently available. Rapid progress
has been made recently in the development of a micropump for
small quantities of fluid (nL - L) with applications in
microdialysis. This use of fluidic devices has a broad impact in
applications ranging from controlled drug infusion, miniature
hydraulic components (light weight but powerful) to manipulation
of small objects such a biological cells. A study of the effects
of microfabrication on the biocompatibility properties of polymer
membranes has also been undertaken. Rapid thermal processing of
semiconductors is a technique for processing materials with a
reduced thermal budget. Current interests include the application
to novel sensor materials.<br>
Previous projects undertaken with industry support have included
silicon pressure sensors, embedded sensors for monitoring the
state of materials during manufacturing processes, glucose
sensors and biosensors.</font></p>

Microfabricated sensors can provide valuable information about
the state of a system. They are used for environmental,
diagnostic and manufacturing process monitoring. Information
retrieved from sensors can be used in a closed loop feedback
control system. We have developed specialized microsensors for
the meaurement of pressure, temperature and the measurement of
carbon monoxiede and other hazardous gases. Environmental
monitoring and self cleaning ovens are areas that incorporate our
sensor applications. In process control, we have developed
disposable microsensors that can be embedded within a polymer,
plastic, or composite material and can provide information about
the curing process. After curing, the sensors can provide
information about stresses or temperature within the material.
Specifically we have developed sensors for the measurement of
dielectric constant, strain, and temperature that can be embedded
in a variety of materials. Information provided by these
microsensors can be read out with wires or by telemetry. </font></p>
