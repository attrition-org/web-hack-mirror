<h3>Miniature Scanning Electron Microscope </h3>

<p>A new method has been developed for miniaturizing charged
particle instruments by precisely stacking silicon chips with
pyrex fibers. This technique will significantly reduce the size
of a SEM (scanning electron microscope) column and x-ray detector
to less than 2cc. These miniature SEMs will have all critical
components permanently aligned to the optical axis and the
fabrication methods can produce one to several dozen columns.
This small size will allow the SEM to be brought to the sample
instead of bringing a small piece of the sample to the SEM. A few
of the applications being explored are inspecting an orbiting
spacecraft's exterior for damage, monitoring thin film deposition
and etching, and locating the STM tip on a substrate. Stacking
combines this century's two highest precision technologies, fiber
optics and semiconductor processing and allows patterning on the
submicron scale in the x, y, and z directions. Fiber optic
technology can control a fiber's diameter to +0.1%/km and yields
500micron pyrex fibers with submicron accuracy. Semiconductor
processing has submicron capability across a 50-300mm wafer as
long as the desired vertical features are limited to 500microns.
Stacking extends the vertical range of semiconductor processing
by a factor of 100. All of the necessary components for a
miniature SEM can be fabricated on four silicon chips. The first
die will have a micromachined field emission source, the next
three die will accelerate, focus, and deflect the electron beam,
and the fourth die will also detect x-rays and back scattered
electrons. A second method of fabricating instruments by slicing
precision structures is being developed. In this method a silicon
wafer with a patterned SiO2 layer is bonded to a pyrex wafer and
is anisotropically etched. The etching creates v-grooves in silicon
islands on the pyrex wafer. A composite glass structure composed
of three types of glass (insoluble- metallizable, insoluble-insulating,
and soluble) is then bonded into the v- grooves. The glass
structure is cut with a dicing saw and the soluble glass removed.
Portions of the insoluble glass are then metallized creating the
following miniature horizontal electron optic devices: electrostatic
quadrupole, travelling wave tube, and a high voltage electron
microscope. X-ray optics A dicing saw has been used to cut
through 95% of the thickness of a silicon wafer. These sawn
wafers can be bent to a sub-meter radius to focus x-rays after
the wafers are etched to remove saw damage.</p>
