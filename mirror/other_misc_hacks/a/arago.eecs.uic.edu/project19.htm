    color="#346281" size="2" face="Arial">he objective of this
    project is to develop a miniature pump suitable for
    microdialysis sampling which is small, light weight, and low
    power. The desired micropump must have the following
    attributes. The dimensions must be small enough so that it
    fits snugly on the back of a rat (or a slightly larger
    animal). It must also be able to deliver liquid to the probe
    reproducibly even when the animal is moving. Chemical resistance
    to saline solutions, which are commonly employed as
    microdialysate perfusates is also important.<br>
    </font><font color="#7B8D3D" size="5" face="ChiselD">T</font><font
    color="#346281" size="2" face="Arial">he pump is a layered
    structure consisting of two silicon wafers bonded to a glass
    plate. The pump diaphragm is deflected to allow filling of the
    pump chamber. This pump also includes two passive check
    valves. The diaphragm is driven by an external source of
    compressed air.<br>
    </font><font color="#7B8D3D" size="5" face="ChiselD">T</font><font
    color="#346281" size="2" face="Arial">he ultimate goal of
    this project is to couple more sophisticated analysis systems
    to the miniaturized microdialysis sampling system. By coupling
    the sampling system to a capillary electrophoresis system with
    either electrochemical or laser-induced fluorescence
    detection, it will be possible to build a customized
    biosensor for any application.<br>
    </font><font color="#7B8D3D" size="5" face="ChiselD">P</font><font
    color="#346281" size="2" face="Arial">otential analytes of
    interest include drugs and their metabolites,
    neurotransmitters, amino acids and catecholamines. In order
    to be able to apply this instrumentation to a large number of
    analytes, it will be necessary to develop the associated
    chemistry which permits separation of components and/or selective
    derivatization to permit subsequent high sensitivity
    detection. </font></p>
