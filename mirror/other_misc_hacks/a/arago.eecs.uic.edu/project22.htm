    between glass surfaces are required for the assembly of
    microfluidic devices. Anodic bonds are formed when hydrated
    glasses are brought into close contact at elevated
    temperature with the passage of electrical current. Anodic
    bonds between etched glass and oxidized silicon surfaces
    permit the formation of closed channels from cavities
    produced by surface etching in photolithography.<br>

    color="#346281" size="2" face="Arial">he reliability of this
    bonding technique is low and the effects of material and
    process parameters on the bond strength are known only on an
    empirical and anecdotal basis. If microfluidic devices are to
    be manufactured on a large scale commercial basis, the anodic
    bonding process must be reliable and predictable. When the
    mechanism of the process is adequately understood, it can be
    optimized to design bonding procedures which can meet these
    criteria.<br>

    project is to develop a set of design rules for anodic
    bonding which can be used to predict the effects of glass chemistry,
    temperature, and applied voltage on the strength and
    reliability of anodic bonds. Planned Research includes:</font></p>

    color="#346281" size="2" face="Arial">ack of adequate bonding
    techniques limits the application of microfluidic devices in
    a number of applications. Anodic bonds can be expected to
    have superior strength, biocompatibility, and fatigue
    resistance in comparison to bonds based on organic adhesives
    or metal solders. Reliable anodic bonding techniques will
    permit the development of microfluidic devices which operate
    at higher pressures, with longer lifetimes and in more
    contamination sensitive environments than can be considered
    with current technology. Advances in anodic bonding will
    expand the microfluidic device market.</font></p>
