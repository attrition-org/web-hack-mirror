        Laboratory (MAL) is a research and development laboratory
        at the University of Illinois at Chicago. It is dedicated
        to the application of 'chip making' technology to improve
        manufacturing methods for electromechanical, mechanical,
        chemical, optical and multi-functional devices which are
        currently being produced with less efficient techniques.
        The Laboratory is located on the University of Illinois
        Chicago campus, just west of Chicago's Loop. The MAL
        staff consists of seven experienced researchers who are
        also faculty members in the University's Department of
        Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a full time
        technical liaison, a technical support staff, and
        associated faculty in other engineering disciplines. The
        laboratory consists of a three thousand square foot clean
        room subdivided into five bays and an equal device
        characterization area. Over two and a half million
        dollars of equipment is installed in the UIC clean rooms.
        Approximately one and a half million dollars of that
        amount has been used to acquire new equipment at the
        cutting edge of microfabrication technology. Unlike
        highly automated industrial production equipment,
        equipment within the Center is flexible and multipurpose
        in function. Cleanroom equipment has been carefully
        chosen to provide strong capability within the thrust
        areas of microsensors, microstructures, micropumps and
        optoelectronics. The clean room is divided into several
        bays to provide work space for various functions
        including metallization, lithography, wet etching and
        chemical vapor deposition (CVD).<br>
        </font><font color="#B39940" size="6" face="ChiselD">T</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial">he lithography bay is equipped with
        a GCA MANN Model 3600 Pattern Generator and GCA MANN
        Model 3696 Stepper fitted with a 10X reduction lens. The
        pattern generator and stepper provide in house mask
        fabrication which facilitates fast turn around when a
        design iteration is needed. Standard positive and
        negative photoresist lithography equipment are available
        in addition to spray development facilities. Two mask
        aligners are installed, a Kasper aligner and a Karl Suss
        MJB3 Infrared aligner for 'front to back' alignment of
        masks to silicon wafers. This special piece of equipment
        is especially useful when making sensors, membranes, and
        three dimensional structures.<br>

        size="2" face="Arial">he metallization capabilities of
        the laboratory are diverse. There are a total of four
        systems: a CVC sputtering station, a cryo-pumped S-gun
        sputtering station, an ion-pumped ultra high vacuum
        e-beam evaporator, and a diffusion pumped e-beam
        evaporator. The CVC sputtering system, has two three inch
        S-guns, two electron guns, two effusion cells, a heated
        substrate, and a filamentless ion gun. The e-beam
        evaporator and second sputtering system are used mainly
        for catalytic metals, an important component of sensor
        fabrication. The remaining thermal evaporator is used to
        deposit gold and aluminum contacts.<br>
        </font><font color="#B39940" size="6" face="ChiselD">T</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial">he oxidation and diffusion area
        consists of two, three-stack Thermco furnaces. The LPCVD
        area consists of a new four-stack furnace made by Process
        Technology configured for silicon nitride, LTO,
        polysilicon, and metal CVD. An important feature of the
        LPCVD system is that variable stoichiometry films may be
        produced for optical waveguides. The plasma enhanced CVD
        capabilities are provided by an ElectroTech 310
        deposition station under computer control, which can
        provide films of silicon nitride, silicon dioxide,
        silicon oxynitride, diamond like diamond structure carbon
        and silicon carbide. <br>
        </font><font color="#B39940" size="6" face="ChiselD">T</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial">he wet chemical etching facilities
        are comprehensive, consisting of an assortment of
        anisotropic, isotropic and electrochemical etching
        equipment for semiconductors, metals and dielectrics.
        Plasma etching includes reactive ion etching and sputter
        etching in an ElectroTech 340 under computer control with
        six mass flow controllers to provide a versatile array of
        gas compositions. A host of 'standard' etching recipes
        utilized regularly by the semiconductor industry and
        experimental recipes for non-standard materials will be
        employed.<br>

        size="2" face="Arial">he inspection and characterization
        bay contains Olympus optical microscopes, a BioRad FTIR
        microscope, a Tencor P1 surface profiler, Gaertner
        ellipsometer, a TopoMetrix Scanning Tunneling and Atomic
        Force Microscope, and a Metricon Prism coupler for the
        measurement of film thickness. The Tencor provides state
        of the art performance in large area surface topography
        measurements, with nanometer resolution over scans of
        several centimeters. This device is extremely valuable in
        characterizing the geometry of micromachined structures
        to an accuracy of about 100 Angstroms. The Materials
        Characterization Laboratory, directed by Professor
        Michael McNallan, includes sample preparation equipment,
        several optical microscopes, a Siemens D-5000 X-ray
        diffractometer, and several electron microscopes. Each
        electron microscopes actually includes two JEOL scanning
        electron microscopes (one T-200 and one T-300) both
        equipped with EDS spectroscopy attachments for elemental
        analysis, one JEOL 100CX scanning and transmission
        electron microscope, also equipped with an EDS system,
        and an Electroscan environmental scanning electron
        microscope which is capable of imaging samples at
        elevated temperatures and at pressures as high as 10
        Torr. <br>

        and Departmental computing facilities and PCs used to
        control individual experiments, the MAL also has a
        dedicated workstation lab with 4 PCs, a Windows NT
        server, a Unix server, and 8 UNIX workstations (Sun, HP
        and SGI). These facilities are used for mask design,
        device design, and finite element modelling.</font></td>
