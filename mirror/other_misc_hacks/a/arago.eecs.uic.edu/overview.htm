        under the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research
        Centers model. Microfluidics in the context of the center
        is defined as the study of miniature devices which can
        pump, mix, monitor or control small quantities of liquids
        or utilize liquids to perform work and motion. Integrated
        circuitry revolutionized the electronics industry. The
        vision of the Microfluidics Center is to similarly

        There are currently no convenient methods for
        interconnecting miniature fluidic devices. Available
        methods involve coupling small diameter tubes by hand
        which is labor intensive. We have an approach to
        connecting these devices using micro flanges and
        integrated packaging of the electronic and fluidic
        elements into one structure.<br>
        Integration of Microfluidic Devices with Sensors<br>
        In order to make microfluidic pumps and other useful
        devices, various parameters including flow velocity,
        pressure, and temperature must be measured. Several
        miniature microsensors are small enough to be integrated
        into microfluidic circuits, but there is also a need to
        develop other devices suitable for integration. In
        particular, flow sensors which can measure flow
        velocities in the 1 cm/min range need to be developed.<br>

        Interconnects<br>
        Separating the fluidic components in a different part of
        the circuit from the circuit's electronic components is
        necessary for a reliable integrated device. By placing
        the electronics on one side of the wafer and the fluidic
        circuit on the other, the seal between the fluidic
        element and the electronic sensor, actuator or drive
        circuit is less of an issue.<br>

        Devices<br>
        Circuit components including high density electronic
        power devices benefit from integrated fluidic cooling
        structures. The maximum power density achievable has been
        demonstrated in excess of 1KW/cm2 by Tuckerman et al..</font></p>

        The ability to distribute power from a single pressure
        generating pump to distributed actuators and the ability
        to scale the force into a useful range by the area of the
        actuator piston are the two key advantages of hydraulic
        actuators. Larger displacements than piezoelectric and
        electrostatic (comb drive) actuators can be realized.
        Components for microhydraulic systems include: pumps to
        impart energy and pressure to the fluid; tubes for
        delivering the fluid; valves to control the fluid flow;
        actuators to convert the fluid pressure to mechanical
        work; sensors to measure pressure, flow rate, actuator
        displacement, and temperature; and electronics which use
        the sensor input to control the pumps, valves and
        actuators. <br>

        A range of chemical analyses are needed to properly

        Many of these standard tests can be automated in
        miniature chemical analyzers. The development of
        miniature chemical sensors and biosensors has produced
        electronic devices for a range of analytes from glucose
        to specific proteins and hormones. By combining the
        analytic capability of a chemical separation technique
        with sensors we can further expand the range of analytes
        and systems that can be analyzed. The world-wide market
        for miniature diagnostic biosensors and analysis systems
        is expected to be $700M by the year 2000.</font></p>
