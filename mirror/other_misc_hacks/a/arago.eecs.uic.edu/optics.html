<h3>Luminescence in Silicon</h3>

<p>We have recently made several significant breakthroughs in the
development of all solid state silicon luminescent devices.
Several of our earlier attempts at current injection from
deposited electrodes resulted in light output that was sporadic,
and unreliable. Recent modifications have lead to more consistent
results with light output of the same spectral character as the
photoluminescence and over much broader areas of the devices. We
are presently investigating the effects of a number of different
process variations and device structure modifications to optimize the
electrically induced luminescence. We have recently succeeded in
producing porous layers of sufficiently good optical quality to
perform optical waveguide measurements. This has allowed the
measurement of the refractive index of the porous layer as a
function of polarization direction (parallel or perpendicular to
the wafer surface). These layers are now being incorporated into
micromachined silicon structures that optimize the coupling of optical
fibers to ridge waveguide structures involving the porous
material. This will allow the performance of more sophisticated
optical measurements such as absorption spectroscopy for light
travelling within the porous layer. The effects of optical or
electrical excitation will be studied to investigate the
possibility of optical gain in the luminescent silicon layer. We
have developed a novel low temperature method for depositing
indium doped tin oxide (ITO) onto porous silicon. Most deposition
methods require heating in the presence of oxygen to produce ITO
films of high transparency and low resistivity. This low
temperature method produces highly transparent highly conducting
contacts with good adhesion without the high temperature
annealing steps that are known to destroy the luminescent
behavior of porous silicon. The resulting n-type ITO on p-type porous
silicon diodes have been probed electrically using
current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C- V) measurements
as a function of temperature. </p>

<h3>Double-V groove ridge waveguides</h3>

<p>A novel waveguide geometry has been developed for fabricating
optical ridge waveguide structures on semiconductor substrates.
Unlike the usual method of depositing a film and patterning it by
etching to produce waveguides with transverse optical confinement
the DVRW structure is produced by anisotropically etching the substrate
to form two closely spaced grooves prior to depositing the
waveguiding film. A ridge waveguide is formed in the region
between the grooves without the need to directly etch the
waveguide material. There are three main advantages of this
method. A wide variety of waveguiding materials may be used
including those that may be difficult to etch or pattern. The
anisotropic etching of the substrate leads to grooves with
extremely smooth side walls. The orientation of the planes
exposed by anisotropic etching of 100 oriented silicon wafers is
such that 90o waveguide bends are easily fabricated. </p>

<h3>Polymeric Waveguides</h3>

<p>We have developed a method for the batch fabrication of
polymeric optical waveguides for use in multichip modules. </p>
