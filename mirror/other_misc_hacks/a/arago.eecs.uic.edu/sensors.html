<h3>Biosensors and Microsensors</h3>

<p>There is a wealth of microsensor technologies that can be
bought to bear on the problem of rising health care costs. A
multitude of parameters need to be measured to aide in medical
diagnosis, including chemical ion concentrations, protein
identification and virus detection, as well as pressure, flow and
temperature. A pertinent example is the screening of a blood bank
for HIV tainted blood. This technology is also very relevant to
food safety and pharmaceutical manufacturing. Microsensors also
play an increasingly important role in modern industry. Sensors
are used to close the feedback loop in many computer controlled
systems. In many cases, the sensor is the limiting feature in the
system because of the greater progress of computer technology in
recent years. Automobiles utilize a constantly increasing number
of sensors to allow monitoring and control of combustion,
crankshaft location, tire pressure, acceleration, etc. Microwave
ovens employ sensors to monitor organic vapors, temperature and
humidity. Clearly, advances in sensor technology are of great
benefit by adding value to industrial products. </p>

<h3>Novel Enzyme Biosensor</h3>

<p>One of the novel sensors currently being investigated at the
MAL is an ultra-thin metal film biosensor. The sensors are
fabricated by evaporation of a thin film of platinum onto an
oxidized silicon wafer. The sensor comprises an ultra-thin metal
film which allows for the immobilization of the biological
material in a thin layer adjacent to the metal islands. The
impedance is measured over a frequency range of 100 Hz to 1 MHz.
When the enzyme glucose oxidase is coated on the surface the
impedance is sensitive to the glucose level in solution. The
impedance decreased and the phase increased in response to
glucose solutions in the range 5 to 100 mM. The response time of
the sensor was less than 15 seconds. This type of measurement has
several advantages:</p>

<ul>
    <li>the biological film is coated in a thin layer adjacent to
        the electrode surface resulting in a rapid response time,</li>
    <li>measurements are made at a potential of just 10 mV,</li>
    <li>there is no reference electrode, and</li>
    <li>it is a generic response mechanism that can be used with
        antibodies, enzymes, and other proteins that undergo
        binding reactions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Manufacturing Process Monitoring</h3>

<p>The development of efficient and cost- effective manufacturing
techniques can be aided by built-in quality controls and a
knowledge of the status of the manufacturing systems in real
time. Sensors can be a vital link in obtaining the information
required. Recent developments in sensor technology have resulted
in a variety of microsensors, manufactured using the
sophisticated and economical techniques of microfabrication.
Microfabricated sensors have electrical outputs that can be
interfaced directly or via telemetry with computers and provide
information for process development and characterization, for
statistical process control, or to monitor every part. At the
MAL, we have developed embedded sensors for monitoring the cure
of polymeric materials, strains, and delaminations. The choice of
the particular sensor system to develop would be determined by
industrial need and the compatibility with the manufacturing
process. </p>
