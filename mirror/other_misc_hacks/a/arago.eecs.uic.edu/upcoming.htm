<blockquote>
  <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monolithic
  Microwave/Millimeter-wave Integrated Circuits (MMICs) have been widely used in
  communication and radar systems during the last two decades, due to their advantages over
  conventional waveguide technology. These advantages include small size and weight, low
  fabrication cost, improved reliability and reproducibility, and broad band operation. As a
  result of these characteristics, MMICs are very attractive to use in a variety of
  applications, such as satellite-to-earth communication links, wireless communication
  networks, system-on-a-chip architectures, anti-collision radars and remote sensing.
  However, the performance of high-frequency MMICs residing on a single substrate can be
  limited by factors such as increased dielectric loss, substrate moding, dispersion, and
  the non-availability of higher-frequency solid-state oscillator sources that are difficult
  to fabricate. Techniques that address these issues and circumvent the associated problems
  have been developed over the past 5 years. For passive structures, the implementation of
  micromachining as one of these techniques will be presented including examples of patch
  antennas with enhanced performance, high-Q filters, resonators and duplexers as well as
  packaging. For active structures, W-band GaAs monolithic multipliers and mixers based on
  Finite Ground Coplanar line technology will be shown. The presentation will also include
  future trends in the related areas.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">John
  Papapolymerou received the Diploma in Electrical Engineering from the National Technical
  University of Athens (N.T.U.A.), Greece, in 1993, and the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. degrees from
  the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1994 and 1999, respectively. Currently, he is an
  Assistant Professor at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the
  University of Arizona, Tucson. His research interests include micromachined and MEMS based
  RF/microwave circuits, wireless chip-to-chip interconnects, W-band monolithic
  transmit/receive modules and RF packaging.He received the Outstanding Graduate Student
  Instructional Assistant Award in 1997 by the American Society for Engineering Education
  (ASEE), University of Michigan chapter.</font></p>
