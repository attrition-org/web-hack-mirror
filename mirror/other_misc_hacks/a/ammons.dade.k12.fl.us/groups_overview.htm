These groups have been developed to help you child to be successful in school and at home.
There are many problems that our children face, but not enough interventions to help [them
cope with these problems. As a parent sometimes our children are reluctant to talk to us,
but maybe a school counselor may be able to get the youth to open their feelings up so
that they can begin to work on these issues.</p>
