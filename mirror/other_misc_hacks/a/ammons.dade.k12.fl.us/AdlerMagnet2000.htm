Dear Magnet Parents,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our recruitment effort is in full swing. The deadline for turning in
your magnet application is February 28, 2001. Please make sure you don't miss this
important deadline.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you probably know, Ammons Middle School is a full magnet school.
That means that every student coming into the school must make an application and
participate in the International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum. This curriculum is more
rigorous than the curriculum of most non-magnet schools and requires students to use
higher order thinking skills and work to their full potential. Also, all students must
take a foreign language (Spanish or French) as one of their electives.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to having the best teaching staff that I have ever worked
with during my 30 years in the M-DCPS system, the school is unparalleled in its use of
technology to enhance student performance. Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been
spent on hardware and software to make Ammons Middle the<br>
leading middle school in the county in the use of technology.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school is also extremely safe. We have one of the lowest
percentages of serious discipline problems of any middle school in Dade County. When you
walk into the school building you see happy staff members and happy children. The
happiness leads to success for our students.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that you will join us by calling or visiting the school at any
time so that we can show you why we are the BEST EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION IN DADE COUNTY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
