<strong><big><big>D.FY.IT Club (which stands for Drug Free Youth In Town).</big></big></strong><br>
<br>
The students of this club are willing to prove to everyone that they are taking a stand
against drugs. They prove this by taking a monthly drug test. I am proved to say that the
Ammons students that are in this club has not failed a drug test in two years. The club
has over 200 students, and we are looking to build on those numbers in the future.<br>
<br>
Drug test is a requirement to be in this club. The students must complete community
service hours. Here at Ammons we have went out into the community to help organizations.
We have went to <a href="dfyit2.htm">Camillus House</a>, <a href="dfyit1.htm">Farm Share</a>,
Community Partnership for Homeless, Inc and marched in the <a href="dfyti4.htm">Martin
Luther King Paraded</a> in West Perrine. We have more community service trips planed after
FCAT. See <a href="dfyit1.htm">pictures</a> to see some the students performing community
service.<br>
<br>
<strong><big><big>SADD (which means Students against Destructive Decisions)<br>
</big></big></strong><br>
The students that are in this club work on making better decision that affect their
personnel lives and social lives. Many of the students that are in the D.FY.IT club are in
the SADD club.<br>
<br>
This club, unlike D.FY.IT has the community come to them. We have had <a href="sadd2.htm">Bay
Point School</a> come discuss decision that got them in that special program, we had the <a href="sadd3.htm">Federal prison</a> send speakers to discuss bad discussion they have
made, and we are having the Playhouse present a play about school violence in February.
