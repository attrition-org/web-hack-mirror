<H1>Multimedia, Wireless Communications and System on Chip at IME</H1>
<P>IME offers system level design capabilities through its System on Chip (SoC) Department. Efforts over last several years were focused on areas of digital multimedia (video and audio processing) and wireless communications, where DSP was the core technology.</P>

<P>The System On Chip (SoC) group is working closely with the VLSI department on the backend design technology and APDS department for that packaging support to provide a total solution of electronics systems. Our vision is to strive to become a recognized center of expertise in the area of System on Chip designs. </P>
