<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">File Descriptor Limits</H1>

<P>
When using a large number of Virtual Hosts, Apache may run out of available
file descriptors (sometimes called <CITE>file handles</CITE> if each Virtual
Host specifies different log files.
The total number of file descriptors used by Apache is one for each distinct
error log file, one for every other log file directive, plus 10-20 for
internal use. Unix operating systems limit the number of file descriptors that
may be used by a process; the limit is typically 64, and may usually be
increased up to a large hard-limit.
<P>
Although Apache attempts to increase the limit as required, this
may not work if:
<OL>
<LI>Your system does not provide the setrlimit() system call.
<LI>The setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE) call does not function on your system
 (such as Solaris 2.3)
<LI>The number of file descriptors required exceeds the hard limit.
<LI>Your system imposes other limits on file descriptors, such as a limit
on stdio streams only using file descriptors below 256. (Solaris 2)
</OL>

In the event of problems you can:
<UL>
<LI>Reduce the number of log files; don't specify log files in the VirtualHost
sections, but only log to the main log files.
<LI>If you system falls into 1 or 2 (above), then increase the file descriptor
limit before starting Apache, using a script like
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
#!/bin/sh <BR>
ulimit -S -n 100 <BR>
exec httpd</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>
<P>
Please see the
<A HREF="../misc/descriptors.html">Descriptors and Apache</A>
document containing further details about file descriptor problems and how
they can be solved on your operating system.
