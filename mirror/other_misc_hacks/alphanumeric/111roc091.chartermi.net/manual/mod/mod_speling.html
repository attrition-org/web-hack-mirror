  <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Module mod_speling</H1>
  <P>
  This module is contained in the <CODE>mod_speling.c</CODE> file,
  and is <STRONG>not</STRONG> compiled in by default.
  It attempts to correct misspellings of
  URLs that users might have entered, by ignoring capitalization
  and by allowing up to one misspelling.<BR>
  This catches the majority of misspelled requests. An automatic
  "spelling corrected" redirection is returned if only one matching
  document was found, and a list of matches is returned if more than
  one document with a sufficiently similar name is found.
  </P>

  <H2>Summary</H2>
  <P>
  Requests to documents sometimes cannot be served by the core apache
  server because the request was misspelled or miscapitalized. This
  module addresses this problem by trying to find a matching document,
  even after all other modules gave up. It does its work by comparing
  each document name in the requested directory against the requested
  document name <STRONG>without regard to case</STRONG>, and allowing
  <STRONG>up to one misspelling</STRONG> (character insertion / omission
  / transposition or wrong character). A list is built with all document
  names which were matched using this strategy.
  </P>
  <P>
  If, after scanning the directory,
  <UL>
   <LI>no matching document was found, Apache will proceed as usual
       and return a "document not found" error.
   <LI>only one document is found that "almost" matches the request,
       then it is returned in the form of a redirection response.
   <LI>more than one document with a close match was found, then
       the list of the matches is returned to the client, and the client
       can select the correct candidate.
  </UL>
  </P>

  ><STRONG>Compatibility:</STRONG></A> CheckSpelling was available as a
  separately
  available module for Apache 1.1, but was limited to miscapitalizations.
  As of Apache 1.3, it is part of the Apache distribution.  Prior to
  Apache 1.3.2, the <SAMP>CheckSpelling</SAMP> directive was only available
  in the "server" and "virtual host" contexts.
  <P>
  This directive enables or disables the spelling module. When enabled,
  keep in mind that
  </P>
  <UL>
   <LI>the directory scan which is necessary for the spelling
       correction will have an impact on the server's performance
       when many spelling corrections have to be performed at the same time.
   </LI>
   <LI>the document trees should not contain sensitive files which could
       be matched inadvertently by a spelling "correction".
   </LI>
   <LI>the module is unable to correct misspelled user names
       (as in <CODE>http://my.host/~apahce/</CODE>), just file names or
       directory names.
   </LI>
   <LI>spelling corrections apply strictly to existing files, so a request for
       the <SAMP>&lt;Location /status&gt;</SAMP> may get incorrectly treated
       as the negotiated file "<SAMP>/stats.html</SAMP>".
