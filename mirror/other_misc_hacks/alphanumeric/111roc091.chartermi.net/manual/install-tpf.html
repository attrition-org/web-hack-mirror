This document outlines the steps needed to install Apache onto a TPF system.
</P>
<P>
You should first read
htdocs/manual/<A HREF="readme-tpf.html">readme-tpf.html</A>
for basic information on the port of Apache to TPF including required PUT level
and supported functions &amp; modules.

Releases of the Apache server are compressed into a "tarball" file and stored on the Apache web site.
You will need to choose a version and download the corresponding tarball to your PC.
Additionally the source code from the tarball will need to be copied onto an MVS OS/390 Open Edition machine 
(later referred to simply as "Open Edition") for compiling.
So here are all the details on how to get Apache and how to get it where it needs to be:
<ol>
   <li><A HREF="http://www.apache.org/dist/">Download</A>
       the gzipped Apache files (the "tarball") to your PC.
       The file name on the web site will be something like <i>apache_1.3.x.tar.gz</i>.
       <br><font color=red size=4>TIP: </font>Be sure to keep the <i>.tar.gz</i> extension
           when choosing the name of the PC file.
       <br><br>
   <li>Decompress the tarball on your PC using WinZip or some other PC decompression tool.
       <br><font color=red size=4>TIP: </font>If you are using WinZip verify that the
            <EM>"TAR File Smart CR/LF Conversion"</EM> option (under Options, Configuration) is NOT checked.<br>
            This is what you can expect if you use WinZip:
       <ul>
           <li>open the tarball with WinZip (this can usually be done simply by double-clicking
               on the downloaded tarball)
           <li>you will be told that the archive contains one file (such as <i>apache_1.3.x.tar</i>) -
               allow WinZip to decompress it to a temporary folder
           <li>extract the archived files onto your PC - 
               you'll be using files from the <tt>conf, htdocs,</tt> and <tt>icons</tt> directories later in the install phase
       </ul>
       <br>
   <li>FTP the tarball to your Open Edition machine using binary mode:
       <ul>
           <li>activate FTP in an MSDOS window: <tt><b>ftp <i>your.open.edition.machine.com</i></b></tt>
           <li>sign in
           <li>set mode to binary: <tt><b>binary</b></tt>
           <li>send the file to Open Edition:<br>
               <tt><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send <i>c:\downloaded_filename.tar.gz open_edition_filename.tar.gz</i></b></tt>
           <li>exit FTP: <tt><b>bye</b></tt>
       </ul>
       <br><font color=red size=4>TIP: </font>
        Open Edition and UNIX file names are case sensitive.  If you use an NFS client to transfer files
        from your PC to Open Edition (instead of using FTP as described above) verify that the NFS drive will transfer the
        file names with upper/lower case preserved.<br>
       <br>
   <li>Decompress the gzipped file on Open Edition: <tt><b>gunzip <i>open_edition_filename.tar.gz</i></b></tt>
       <br>Note that the <i>.tar.gz</i> file will be replaced by the gunzipped <i>.tar</i> archive file.
       <br><br>
   <li>Extract the archived files necessary for compiling Apache:  
       <ul>
           <li><tt><b>pax -rvkf <i>open_edition_filename.tar</i> -o from=ISO8859-1,to=IBM-1047 "*/src"</b></tt>
           <li>switch to the source code subdirectory of the newly extracted apache directory: <tt><b>cd <i>apache-1.3</i>/src</b></tt>
           <li>remove unnecessary subdirectories:
               <tt><b>rm -r os/bs2000 os/mpeix os/netware os/os2 os/os390 os/win32</b></tt>
       </ul>
</ol>
<br>
<H2 align=center><A NAME="compilation">Compilation</A></H2>
<P>
Apache supports the notion of "optional modules".  However,
the server has to know which modules are compiled into it.  In order for
those modules to be effective, it is necessary to generate a short bit of
code (modules.c) which simply has a list of them. If you are using the <tt>Configure</tt> utility
and <tt>make</tt>, modules.c and other necessary files will be created for you automatically.
</P>
<P>
The provided scripts assume a c89 compiler and have only been tested on an
Open Edition environment.  If you are using a platform other that
Open Edition you may need to modify src/os/tpf/TPFExport and src/Configure
to match your environment.
</P>
<font color=red size=4>TIP: </font>
Editing files on your PC prior to moving them to Open Edition may result
in the loss/addition of unprintable characters.  Files of concern include shell
scripts and src/Configuration.  The most common problems are with
tab characters and CR/LF characters.  Most editors will handle the CR/LF problem correctly
but none seem to handle tab characters.  If you need to edit files prior to moving them to Open Edition,
edit them in a UNIX editor such as vi or emacs.<br>
<P>
Note that Open Edition commands in this section are shown in
<TT><STRONG>bold</STRONG></TT>,
are case sensitive, and must be made from the "src" directory.
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Overlay src/Configuration with src/Configuration.tmpl:  
    <TT><STRONG>cp&nbsp;Configuration.tmpl&nbsp;Configuration</STRONG></TT>
    <BR><BR>
<LI>Edit src/Configuration.  It contains the list and settings
    of various "Rules" and an additional section at the bottom that determines
    which modules to compile:
    <BR><BR>
    <UL>
    <LI>Adjust the Rules and <TT>EXTRA_CFLAGS|LIBS|LDFLAGS|INCLUDES</TT>
        if you feel so inclined.
    <BR><BR>
    <LI>Comment out (by preceding the line with a "#") lines corresponding
        to those modules you DO&nbsp;NOT wish to include.
    <BR><BR>
    <LI>Uncomment (by removing the initial "#", if present) lines
        corresponding to those optional modules you wish
        to include or add new lines corresponding to any custom modules
        you have written.
        The htdocs/manual/<A HREF="readme-tpf.html">readme-tpf.html</A>
        document lists the modules that have been tested on TPF.
    </UL>
    <br>The modules placed in the Apache distribution are the ones that have been
    tested and are used regularly by various members of the Apache development
    group.  Additional modules contributed by members or third parties with specific
    needs or functions are available at
    <A 
HREF="http://www.apache.org/dist/contrib/modules/">http://www.apache.org/dist/contrib/modules/</A>.
    There are instructions on that page for linking these modules into the core Apache
    code.
    <BR><BR>
<LI>Set the TPF environment variables:
    <TT><STRONG>.&nbsp;os/tpf/TPFExport</STRONG></TT>
    <BR>
    (The initial period and blank on the command are required to ensure
    the environment variables exist beyond the scope of the shell script.)
    This script will set the environment variables required to compile the
    programs for TPF.  Verify that the export variables are valid for your
    installation, in particular, the system include file directories.  The
    system include files must reside on your Open Edition system in the
    appropriate file structure similar to /usr/include and /usr/include/sys.
    DO&nbsp;NOT modify the <TT>TPF=YES</TT> export variable.  If this is
    changed, the "Configure" script will not recognize TPF.
    <BR><BR>
<LI>Run the "Configure" script:
    <TT><STRONG>Configure</STRONG></TT>
    <BR>
    This generates modules.c, include/ap_config_auto.h, and necessary Makefiles:
      <PRE>
      Using config file: Configuration
      Creating Makefile
       + configured for TPF platform
       + setting C compiler to c89
       + setting C pre-processor to c89 -E
       + checking for system header files
       + adding selected modules
       + checking sizeof various data types
      Creating Makefile in support
      Creating Makefile in regex
      Creating Makefile in os/tpf
      Creating Makefile in ap
      Creating Makefile in main
      Creating Makefile in modules/standard
      $ _
      </PRE>
    If you want to maintain multiple configurations, you can
    say, <EM>e.g.</EM>,
    <BR>
    <TT><STRONG>Configure -file Configuration.ai</STRONG></TT>
    <BR>
      <PRE>
      Using config file: Configuration.ai
      Creating Makefile
       + configured for &lt;whatever&gt; platform
       + setting C compiler to &lt;whatever&gt;
      et cetera
      </PRE>
    If you receive an error such as "<TT>Configure 146: FSUM7351 not found</TT>"
    the most likely explanation is that one or more of the <tt>make</tt> related
    files were edited on a non-UNIX platform, corrupting the end-of-line marks.
    Verify that lines ending with "\" in the flagged file do&nbsp;not have trailing
    spaces.  Using the vi editor and the sample error above as an example...
    <BR><BR><PRE>
            pull up the flagged file:       <STRONG>vi&nbsp;Configure</STRONG>
            turn on punctuation:            <STRONG>:set&nbsp;list</STRONG>
            go to the line in question:     <STRONG>146G</STRONG>
               or find a line with a "\":   <STRONG>/\\</STRONG></PRE>
    The end of line should display as "<TT>\$</TT>".  If it is displayed as
    "<TT>\ $</TT>" (with a blank between \ and $) then you should revert to the
    distributed version of the file and make the site-specific
    changes again using a UNIX compatible editor such as vi or emacs.
    Then try the Configure command again.
    <BR><PRE>            close the file:                 <STRONG>:q  </STRONG>(or <STRONG>:quit!</STRONG>)</PRE>

<LI>Edit include/ap_config.h if you would like the scoreboard kept in shared
    memory instead of file or system heap.<br>
    The default behavior for Apache on all platforms <i>except</i> TPF is to use the
    file system for maintaining the scoreboard (which holds current Apache children status).
    The default behavior for Apache on TPF is to use system heap.  Available with
    PUT10 is the use of shared memory for the scoreboard in place of the file system.
    This reduces file activity for the parent Apache ECB and improves performance.
    To activate shared memory, uncomment or <em>add</em> the directive
    <tt><b>#define&nbsp;USE_SHMGET_SCOREBOARD</b></tt>
    and comment out or <em>remove</em> the directive <tt><b>#define USE_TPF_SCOREBOARD</b></tt>
    both of which are in the TPF section in ap_config.h.
    This change will only take effect after Apache is (re)compiled.
    <br><br>
    If you prefer to use the file system instead of system heap or shared memory, ensure that both
    <tt>USE_TPF_SCOREBOARD</tt> and <tt>USE_SHMGET_SCOREBOARD</tt> are commented out or removed.
    This change will only take effect after Apache is (re)compiled.

<A NAME="daemon"></A><br>&nbsp;<br>
<LI>Edit include/ap_config.h if you plan on using the ZINET DAEMON model instead of the NOLISTEN model.<br>
    The default behavior is to let Apache check the server status (active/inactive) with ZINET
    and shut itself down when appropriate.  The default behavior also includes checking Apache's activation number.
    Available with PUT11 (PJ25761) ZINET can perform these functions instead of Apache by using the DAEMON model.
    This model offers increased reliability and is preferred over the NOLISTEN model.
    If Apache goes down while running under the NOLISTEN model ZINET will not reactivate it nor alert the operator.
    To use the DAEMON model you must modify the default behavior of Apache by uncommenting or adding the directive
    <tt><b>#define&nbsp;USE_TPF_DAEMON</b></tt> within the TPF section in ap_config.h.
    This directive is also recommend when starting Apache from the command line (APAR PJ26515).
    This change will only take effect after Apache is (re)compiled.
    <br><br>


<LI>Now compile the programs: <TT><STRONG>make</STRONG></TT><BR>
    Besides compiling, <tt>make</tt> also runs main/gen_test_char.c and main/gen_uri_delims.c
    in order to create main/test_char.h and main/uri_delims.h respectively<BR><BR>
    If during compilation you get a warning about a missing 'regex.h', set
    <TT>WANTHSREGEX=yes</TT> in the src/Configuration file and start back at the
    <TT><STRONG>Configure</STRONG></TT> step.

<LI>Link the compiled object files into a DLL.
    Sample link JCL has been included as src/os/tpf/samples/linkdll.jcl.
    You will need to modify this JCL:
    <ul>
       <li>Change the IDs, data set names, and libraries for your particular site.
       <li>Add/remove <TT>mod_<EM>xxx</EM>.o</TT> files so they correspond to the
           <TT>mod_<EM>xxx</EM>.o</TT> lines in your src/Configuration file.
    </ul>
  <br><font color=red size=4>TIP: </font>
  Do NOT include gen_test_char.o or gen_uri_delims.o in the link JCL since these files are only
  used during the <tt>make</tt> step.
  <br><br>
<LI>Create a loadset.  Sample loadset JCL has been included as src/os/tpf/samples/loadset.jcl.
    You will need to modify this JCL for your particular site.
  <br><br>
<LI>Load (<tt>ZOLDR LOAD</tt>) and activate (<tt>ZOLDR ACT</tt>) the loadset on your test system.
  <br><br>
<LI>Ensure that the program name you are using for Apache has <tt>RESTRICT</tt> and <tt>KEY0</tt> authorization.
    <tt><b>zdpat <i>pppp</i>&nbsp;</b>(<b>c-c</b>)</tt> will display allocation information.
    You can use <tt><b>zapat&nbsp;<i>pppp</i>&nbsp;restrict&nbsp;key0&nbsp;</b>(<b>c-c</b>)</tt> to alter the
    authorization.
    Note that if the program name is unallocated, you must have the loadset for it activated or you will receive
    INVALID PROGRAM NAME from the <tt>zdpat/zapat</tt> entries.
   <br><br>
<LI>
  Apache requires a configuration file to initialize itself during activation.
  (Previously three configuration files were used.)
  Copy the distribution version, /conf/httpd.conf-dist, to /conf/httpd.conf and then
  edit the /conf/httpd.conf copy with your site specific information.
  <BR><BR>
  General documentation for Apache is located at
  <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/docs/">http://www.apache.org/docs/</A>
  and in the HTML pages included with the distribution (tarball) under the
  /htdocs/manual directory.
  <BR><BR>
<LI>On TPF activate ZCLAW and update INETD using ZINET entries, the common case:
    <BR><BR>
    <PRE>
    ZINET ADD S-TFTP PGM-CTFT PORT-69 PROTOCOL-UDP MODEL-NOWAIT

    ZINET ADD S-APACHE PGM-<EM>pppp</EM> MODEL-NOLISTEN
    or ZINET ADD S-APACHE PGM-<EM>pppp</EM> MODEL-DAEMON USER-root <A HREF="#daemon">(see notes above regarding the DAEMON model)</A></PRE>
  Please refer to <EM>IBM Transaction Processing Facility Transmission Control
  Protocol/Internet Protocol Version 4 Release 1</EM> for more information
  on ZCLAW, INETD, and TFTP.
  <BR><BR>
<LI>Prior to sending a request to your Apache server from a browser,
    TFTP the configuration file, log, icons and web pages to your TPF system.
    A typical directory structure for Apache is as follows:
<PRE>     /usr/local/apache/conf
     /usr/local/apache/logs
     /usr/local/apache/icons
     /usr/local/apache/htdocs</PRE>
    All gif, jpg, and zip files should be TFTP'd as binary; conf files and html pages should be TFTP'd as text.
    <br>The logs directory must exist in order to avoid an <CODE>fopen</CODE> error while running Apache.
    If you're running a PUT10 or higher version of TPF make the directory using the
    <tt><b>zfile mkdir /usr/local/apache/logs</b></tt> functional entry.
    If you're running TPF version PUT09 TFTP an empty file into the logs subdirectory to create it.  
    <br><br>
<LI>Start the server using the <tt><b>ZINET START S-APACHE</b></tt> command.
</OL>
<A NAME="visualage">&nbsp;</A>
<H2 align=center>Compiling with VisualAge TPF</H2>
<P>
  It is not required that <tt>make</tt> be used to compile Apache for TPF:
  Individual programs may be compiled using IBM's VisualAge TPF product.
  This is particularly useful when compiling selected programs for the Debug Tool.
