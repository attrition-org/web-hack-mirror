A proposal for a collaborative exobiology study has been submitted to Professor Antje Hofmeister and Scott Dawson for approval.  So far, we have two students for this study:  Eric Evans and Andrew LePhong.  Candidate extremophiles and Archea are:  iron, sulfur, halophilic and cyanobacteria.  Professor David Boone, University of Portland's Subsurface Microbial Culture Collection (SMCC-Western Division) will be sending us a culture of Bacillus infernus, first isolated from Columbia basalt several kilometers deep.  This species is the first strict anerobe found belong to the genus Bacillus.  Martian basalt may harbor like species of bacteria.  When the methodology has been finalized, we will commence.  Meanwhile, a literature search continues to see if other experiments were done. If you are interested in this project, see me.  We may be able to add one or two more students.

A new microbiology laboratory course is being offered as PMBC 112L, course code #71268 with Professor Antje Hofmesiter and Scott Dawson, Tuesdays 1-5 pm 208 GPB Laboratory for 2 units.  UCB has not have a course like this one for years.  You will learn to isolate, identify bacteria using basic microbiology techniques.  The class will isolate bacteria, even Archea and extremophiles and run experiments.  This class fits in beautifully with our Exobiology experiments to determine if they can survive under Martian conditions in soil simulants.  A paper could come out of this project for presentation at NASA next spring.  There will be one field trip on a Saturday for sample collection.  All students and interested persons are encouraged to enroll in this class if they want to be part of the Exobiology Project.  It is strongly recommended to learn the basic techniques.  You may email Professor Hofmeister :  ahofm@nature.berkeley.edu or Scott Dawson :  sdawson@nature.berkeley.edu.

The Triple Point of Water Experiment for Feasibility of Liquid Water on Mars will continue.

Providing that laboratory space and equipment availabity, interested students will be trained in basic microbiology techniques so that the exobiology experiments will proceed properly.  Training will consist of:

      Asepctio and pure culture techniques
      Media and reagent preparation and sterilization
      Use of the autoclave and fitration techniques
      Gram Stain and Acridine Orange Stain Methods
      Titering of bacterial suspensions and Plate Count Method
      Inoculation of samples and subculturing
      Microscopy
      Biohazard handling and safety

      These are the minimal requirements to do the experiments.  In fact, this training could qualify you as a microbiology laboratory assistant.

      After training, we will use available extremophile cultures under Level I (biohazard minimal).

Lanny Rudner is a research assistant for Dr. Bernard Halloran at the University of Califonria, San Francisco Veterans Administration Hospital.  Lanny is working on an experiment which will fly on the Space Shuttle during the Spring of 2002.  He and Dr. Halloran are studying the role of age in the response of bone to spaceflight.  The flight experiment will study bone loss in young vs. old rats using a novel bone labeling technique (an osmotic mini-pump implanted in the rats will time-release the bone label).

Diana Chai and Lanny Rudner have recently been accepted to the NASA Reduced Gravity Student Flight Opportunities Program.  They will conduct an experiment on NASA's KC-135 "Vomit Comet" at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, during February 2001.  Their experiment will test a novel enhancement to microgravity treadmill running (the "Vomit Comet" is an airplane that flies in parabolic trajectories and which can create up to 30 seconds of "zero-g" time for researchers and astronauts to conduct experiments and train).  After the flight, the team will conduct their Outreach Plan.  They will present their work to the Berkeley/Oakland community by making presentations to faculty and students at UC Berkeley, making presentations in local schools, inviting local students into their lab for hands-on activities, and presenting at the Lawrence Hall of Science.  Information about these events will be posted after the February flight.  The following address, from the Student Flight Opportunities webpage, will show you a list of the schools and projects accepted for the February flights:  http://www.tsgc.utexas.edu/floatn/2000/august2000/teams.html)

There were over 200 papers presented by scientists from Russia, Germany, England, France, Italy and a few from UC Berkeley at the Lunar and Planetary Institute's "Concepts and Approaches for the Exploration of Mars, July 18-20th.  The theme appears to be Water follows Life and various instrumentations to search for biomarkers.  I presented a paper on the Conceptual Model of a Robotics Laboratory to Search for Life in Martian subsurface water and I had only ten minutes to make my point.  Pertinent to my our project, some new microscopy techniques appear.  
They are Atomic Force Microscopy, Confocal Microscopy and Scanning Probe Microscopy.  The European Space Agency (ESA) Beagle II presented their experiments.  David Des Marais from the Ames Resarch Center told me that NASA was shy about using robotics because of the Viking inconclusive experimental results, but it is gradually returning to the idea of favoring robotics.

 I will present the same paper at the Mars Society Convention at Toronto, Canada August 11th.  Professor Kuznetz will present our Triple Point of Water experimental results on August 10th.  Hopefully, our presentations will generate interest for grant funding for our projects.

NASA reported today that the Mars Global Surveyer has found liquid water on Mars.  Just where we said we would be...rightr in the deep canyons  where the  temperatures  rise up above zero degrees C.
Now we will have a good chance of finding some form of life there, most probably bacteria, but there may be higher forms of Protista, too.  Watch for more announcements by NASA.  I hope to present a paper on my conceptual model of the robotics laboratory to search for life on Mars at Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) at Houston July 17-19.  I have listed all in the Geology section as co-authors since you may be working on this project this fall.  We will need engineering, computer science majors as well as biology people on this project. I am studying several models of microscopy for this laboratory. Stay tune for more news.  Have a nice summer!

Our students gave it their best shot at the HEDS-UP convention despite the fact they 
the fact that they arrived late and did the rehearsals til four in the morning just hour before their presentation.

A BBQ is planned for May 21st, Sunday after the finals to get together to eat, discuss next semster's plans and ideas for for projects. So come and be be prepared with your ideas.

The time:  1:00 to 5:00 pm  Sunday May 21ar.

Place:  David Gan's BBQ  pit at 1637 Franklin Street, near Cedar in Berkeley, just one block west of the North Berkeley BART station.  You could take BART, get off of the North Berkeley Station, walk westward to Franklin Street.  Maps will be distributed at the last class on Monday.  Please let me know if you are a vegetarian.  I plan to have Shish Kabob, soft drinks, cookies, chips etc.

If it rains, it will be a buffet indoors.

The latest Martian weather data on surface temperature and pressure may be found on the following Web Sites:

    http://nova.stanford.edu/projects/mgs/late.html

    http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/

    We will use the data to plot the temperatures/pressure on our general Mars map, then identify possible subsurface ancient water sites such as Hebe chasma and the Gusev crater.  
    We hope to resolve the controversy if liquid water is feasible on the Martian surface from permafrost and wet soil.    

    Dr. Robert Quinn has been contacted for the Triple Point of Water experiment to be done on campus.
