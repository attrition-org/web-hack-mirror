<title>encrypt0 was here!</title>

This webpage was compromised by encrypt0! Oh, and I can only hack NT huh? I defaced this plainly
because I felt like it. What can I say, I was bored. However, for once I had a reason to deface!
Wow! That's a first for me. So any way, here is the reason. This BBS was all about beating me in
a cybewar. Well, look who won, huh? I think that this anti-encrypt0 group fell quickly and to none
other than myself, encrypt0. So for that I have changed your admin password, defaced index.html, 
deleted your posts, and changed the admin contact. So, I guess that will teach you to mess with me.
I did not want to hit the hosting service, yourbbs.com because actually it is a cool site allowing free
BBSes. Keep it up guys! So, back to this defacement. I feel that I have learned so much at such a
young age, from not knowing how to use unicode to defacing Apache/1.3.11 (Unix) mod_perl/1.24 on FreeBSD.
within a few months. With the exception of this hack, I don't destroy or want to make havoc for
a sysadmin. I just want to stretch my abilities to as far as they can go. 

Shouts: Antifarmer, WOH, SoldierX, DataCha0s, Sneed, D-Force, InX, RuBiX, cowhead2000, M.D.C., phRoZen, b|tsPsEc, and nameless others.

Fuck offs(descriptions on why they suck, too.):

Kebab Kru: You little fucks, you insult me on your defacements. Saying shit behind my back isn't
a wise thing to do morons. Aren't you so 31337 for defacing NT! Dumb shits. And if you wanna talk to
these fags, try irc.dumbfuckers.net #fagclan, at least they probably hang out in there.

Daprez: Hey you little bitch! You ask me to deface for your group in exchange of "toolz". haha!
You can go to hell! You come on IRC in the channel where I hang out with my friends and just insult
us for no reason, although you are the dumb pile of bull crap. This moron likes to make an ass out
of himself at: irc.dal.net #crewace.

All the people who ever insulted me and/or said I couldn't hack or didn't help me:<- Look who's
laughing now you bastards! haha! Now when you come crawling back to me for help, i am just gonna
say,"Fuck you!" and see how you like it. For anyone who has disses me for defacing NT, look at this?
Apache/1.3.11 (Unix) mod_perl/1.24 on FreeBSD. hmm... I don't quite see "NT" in there, do you? 
And for anyone who couldn't take a minute or two out of their time to lend me a hand, Fuck you, too.
