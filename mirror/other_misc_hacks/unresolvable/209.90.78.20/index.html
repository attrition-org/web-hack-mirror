The bombing is ridiculous! The Ethnic Albanians and the Serbians have been
fighting in a civil war for hundreds of years. Both sides have been killing each other for generations...it hasnt been a one sides holocaust, this one has been two sided!

Why did those kids kill the other kids? Did it ever dawn on anyone that
years of tormenting could of had some kind of impact? I am not saying that,
that was an excuse, but it sure played a huge part in their animosity toward
their school. Maybe if we all learned more TOLERANCE for people, that would
of never happened, and those 15 people would still be alive today.  Furthermore, societies tendancy to blame this stuff on the media, music, and video games is crazy.  Guns DONT shoot themselves and bombs dont build themselves.  Parents have to start looking at the way they raise their children.  Instead of going after the individuals who express their beliefs and the companies who write computer games, how about they go to the root of the problem, PARENTAL GUIDANCE! And to all those richy rich parents who ignore their kids... SHAME ON YOU! The kid who made the bombs had the equipment all over his floor... pay attn to ur kids!
