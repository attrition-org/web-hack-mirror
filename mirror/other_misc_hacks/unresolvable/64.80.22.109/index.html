Kashmir this. Pakistan this. Free this. Notice this. Hack a website, that'll get something done. Point out how some skinny
little middle eastern admin didn't know to secure his box against one of your ./hack's - becuase if you do, the leaders of
every big nation will rush to the rescue, and your little 'hacking group' will be heroes. Somewhere in Kashmir, a hybrid
breed of cow will be named after your famed hacker group alias. <p>
Far be it from me to start trouble with any elite group of middle easter hackers, or god forbid a brazilian band of
keyboard warriors, but if you're going to ./wuftp, ./statd or (I know you're all above using using iis exploits
right?) anything along those lines, just be honest and put "I defaced this website in an effort to better promote my
hacking reputation and to impress my bud's on IRC". The people who traffic attrition daily deserve at least that much
honesty.<p>
<br>"Why pick JESNA to deface?"
<br>
for one, it's fitting to the rant.. second.. anything dealing with the word 'jew' is always funny.
<br><br>
Now, don't be all offened.. pr0phet likes jews :>

This is where the shouts go right? - sm0ked crew (krad), #innersanctum, The-Rev (you kickass), sh|v3r (gettin good kid!), 
highvolts, opt1k, nawk,
gotter, node, zeeon, Connah, and my elite hunnie awlib.

admin: nothing was harmed on your computer just mv index2.html index.html and you'll be set, sorry to use your site for
this rant ;>
