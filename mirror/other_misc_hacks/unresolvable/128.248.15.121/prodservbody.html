<p>Whether it is a fully developed audio, video or multimedia production or
simply specific production elements custom produced to fit your needs, our
staff are specialists at creating eyecatching and informative professional
communications. Video images can illustrate, demonstrate, illuminate,
document, promote and transcend time and distance. The initial cost of a
videotape often saves money over time. These savings may come in the form
of reduced travel expenses, reduced presentation time, or by accomplishing
program objectives that were previously unattainable without video.

<p>A videotape or a live satellite broadcast can be sent anywhere in the
world.  Laboratory experiments, research results, surgical techniques, and
classroom lectures can be captured on tape and preserved for use over and
over...anytime.  Video can enhance your communications with a medium that
people are familiar with, and can be engaging as well as entertaining.

<p>Audio production services are offered primarily in support of video and
multimedia projects. This includes narration recording, use of our
licensed professional music library for soundtracks, and remote audio
recording for program enhancement and audio special effects. Additional
services include remote audio documentation of professional meetings and
custom audio recording sessions in our professional studio.

<p>All consultations are free of charge. To inquire about our production
services, call Joseph Faust at (312) 996-7912.
