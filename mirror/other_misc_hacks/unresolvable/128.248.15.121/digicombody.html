<p>Digital communications are expanding the reach of educators to learners
in nonsynchronous distance learning formats.  These include web-based
courses, CD-ROMs, two-way compressed video transmission, and digital
satellite broadcasts.  We provide faculty support for adapting traditional
lecture presentations and visual content to a variety of live and
pre-recorded transmission formats.  Whether it's via satellite, the web, a
CD or a hybrid application of digital and analog technology, we can assist
you in developing your material and maximizing your confidence and
effectiveness.

<p>All  consultations are free of charge. For more information, contact
Joseph Faust at (312)  996-7912.
