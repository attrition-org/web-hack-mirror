<p>Satellite communication services include uplinks and downlinks. Uplink
services are original broadcasts to a statewide or nationwide audience.
Past clients include the VA Hospitals, The Illinois Geriatric Education
Council, the NAACP and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.  Programs originate in
our studios and are beamed to a ground station via our microwave link to
the John Hancock Building. 

<p>Downlink services are simply receiving someone else's progam via
satellite and distributing it to an on-campus location.  From our studio
control room we can distribute satellite programming to both Campus
Unions, the Eye and Ear Infirmary and via the network video server and
videoconferencing systems in the <a
href="http://www.uic.edu/depts/accc/" target="_top">Academic Computing and
Communications Center</a>.  We have a satellite viewing room that will
hold up to 25 people that is available free of charge during regular
business hours.

<p>We can provide viewing of PBS Adult Learning Service events.  Check out PBS's<a
href="http://www.pbs.org/als/programs/live/index.html"
target="bodybody">schedule</a> and give us
a call to schedule a downlink of any program that suits your interests.

<p>All consultations are free of charge. To inquire about our satellite
communication services, call Joseph Faust at (312) 996-7912.
