<p align="center"><font face="Courier New" color="#FF8000"><small>He spent fifteen years
getting loaded,<br>
Fifteen years 'till his liver exploded<br>
Now what's bob gonna do now that he can't drink?<br>
The doctor said, &quot;what were you thinkin' 'bout?&quot;<br>
Bob said, &quot;That's just the point,<br>
I wasn't thinkin' 'bout nothing<br>
Now i gotta do something else<br>
To pass the time.&quot;<br>
Had someone shave his head got a new identity<br>
Sixty-two holed air conditioned boots<br>
And a girl who rides a scooter<br>
To take him out of town<br>
They would get away riding around,<br>
As the trucks drive by<br>
You could here the motherfuckers go...<br>
A couple of lines, an extra thermos of Joe<br>
He'll be kickin' in heads at the punk rock show<br>
Bob's the kinda guy who knows just what<br>
Bob's the kinda guy who knows just what to do<br>
When the doctor tells him to<br>
&quot;Quit your drinkin', now's the time.&quot;<br>
Will he ever walk the line<br>
To all my friends, I feel just great<br>
But will he ever walk the line<br>
Kickin' ass, bustin' heads red suspenders<br>
Once a day he shaves his head<br>
But will he ever walk the line?<br>
Will he ever walk the line?<br>
Will he ever walk the line?<br>
Will he ever walk the line?</small></font></p>
