Hi :) I kind of feel like everyone is waiting for what Mafi has to say about all this...asking me questions on irc etc.. So my only public statement I have to make is this. Most ppl in general do not like rejection.
Anyone with even the smallest amount of common sense can see what is going on here so why should I explain? I just have to comment on the defacing statement he made however..You think defacement is lame but uhm how many 
defacements did you do?? lol Everything you say is a lie or contradiction. Everyone knows this..hell you lie from one statement to the next. Do you honestly think I am the only one who notices this?  I could be immature
and post logs to prove certain points of my arguements, like the nice love poems and you asking for me to get back with you..*Please marry me* etc etc I could go on and on and use this opportunity to slam you with the truth 
but why bother?! You reacted in the same manner any insecure little boy reacts to rejection.
skrilla aka unistd of dal.net, you need a reality check. 


I would also like to thank the people that mean the most to me online and off, you know who you are.
