<h1>Welcome to TheGolems <br>BigSmart Chat Room</h1><p>

<b>To effectively use this chat room, you need to post the time you will 
be here (invite others to meet you in the room). This program uses JAVA so 
there is no wait for a page to refresh. You can also set the "ignore" feature
to exclude those you do not want to talk to, or you can open a new window to 
chat with someone if you want a private chat session. You can also activate
chat, return to a message board (by minimizing the screen) and when someone posts you can contact them 
via the message board and ask them to meet you in the chat room. You can also maximize the 
screen. There are several options. Check them out. But, essentially, this is  
basicly a simple and fast chat room. There are 
NO registration requirements and you may use anonymous nicknames. Enjoy the chat room and 
use it whenever you want..  TheGolem</b></font>
