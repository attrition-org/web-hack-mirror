<H1>MESSAGE BOARD REGISTRATION</H1>
<p>
<HR>
<p>

Fill out <B>all the fields</b> in this form.  Realizing that some of you
for whatever reasons prefer to remain anonymous, you may use a pseudonym
when posting to the message boards; but, if you choose to do so, you MUST
register that information. If you are going to use your correct name, you
DO NOT need to register. And, one registration covers all the boards..
This is the only time you will have to register as long as you use the
same username. If you change your username, you MUST register again.

Requiring registration is not an estoppel to posting, nor a form of
censorship. Registration, pure and simply enables greater security for
this server and discourages intentional and malicious conduct. 

Your username will be checked against the username you use to post and
will be confirmed. If not validated your post will be deleted. And, if you
enter misleading or false information here, you will be toast. If you
violate this privilege you may be blocked from posting to the boards and
continuing to do so will be considered spamming the boards, which is
itself a violation of the AUP (Approved Use Plan) for this server.
 
PRIVACY: The information you provide will be encrypted and will not be
available to anyone but me and will not be used for any other purpose than
to keep non-registered users off the board.  If you share a password, the
information will not match what is in the server logs and violators will
be deleted and blocked.

Before you post, be sure to read the <a
href="../boards/Policy.html"><b>Posting Policy</b></a> here
and stay on-topic and in compliance with the rest.

When you choose a username, USE ONE word. Make your pseudonym unique so
others will associate all your remarks with your nom de plume. Two word
usernames will not work. If you choose to use two words, hyphenate the
words, i.e. "red-feather", "motor-mouth", etc. Remember your unique
username because it will not be registered to anyone else and you will
need to type it each time you post.

When you complete this form, you will be returned to the message board
directory. Have fun and enjoy the boards.
