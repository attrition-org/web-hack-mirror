<p><font face="comic sans ms" color=yellow size=5>How much tobacco does
your cigarette contain?</font><P>

            This isn't a trick question. </font>

<font face="fantasy" color=pink size=3>
Many American brands contain very little tobacco.<bR> Many contain
          a lot of _reconstituted_ tobacco.

What is RECONSTITUTED TOBACCO?<P>
<FONT COLOR=WHITE SIZE=3>

It is a material made from waste and scrap.<BR> It is <CITE>NOT</CITE> 
leaf tobacco. <BR>
It is <CITE>alpha-cellulose</CITE>.<p>
<BR> ALPHA-CELLULOSE IS WASTE<br>
<font color=yellow>It is forest
industry waste.<BR>
It is municipal waste.<BR>
And, it is anything that is used to form
alpha-cellulose.<p>

AND IT ISN'T VERY GOOD FOR YOU.

Alpha-cellulose is pure cellulose which is treated by all those chemicals
the tobacco industry puts into their cigarettes to make them
 smokeable. That's why they
add solvents, because the density of cellulose is very dense and difficult
to get flavoring agents into - so the cigarette manufacturers add solvents
(benzene, phosgene, cyclohexane), flavoring agents, dyes, aromatics and
other chemicals <FONT COLOR=RED>(about 400 in all)</FONT> to penetrate the
cellulose fibers. <p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER><FONT FACE="helvetica" color=violet size=4>
That is what you have been inhaling with Standard Brands.</font>
<p></center>
But, whatever you choose to do, why not give Native-Americans your 
business (they need it) and help yourself also because you will be 
buying them for LESS? 

<blockquote> <blockquote><P> You really shouldn't be
smoking at all. Smoking is a very dangerous health risk. It is a personal
choice if we smoke but to promote a product which is a known risk to
others is no longer just a matter of clear choice. It becomes an ethical
and moral issue because you may be responsible for someone's life and
profit from it. 

</blockquote>  I'm only telling you there are
alternatives for those who feel they must smoke and it isn't the cigarette
clubs. and doing so won't net me a dime, but it might prevent some fool
from joining a doomed to failure MLM cigarette club. Several MLM schemes
have been tried and the only ones to make any money were the top sponsors
and the owners. There are MLMs that do work. One is getting paid to surf
and it is the latest internet trend. Check it out. Go to: <a
href="../index.html">TheGolemsPlace</a> and follow the links from
"Special Announcements" posted to that page. You'll find an analysis of
these programs with recommendations and which programs to avoid. Read it
before you join any MLM.

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>BE SMART! IF YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE YOUR CIGARETTES,
DON'T ORDER FROM CLUBS, ORDER THEM CHEAPER BY ORDERING THEM DIRECT FROM
NATIVE-AMERICANS:<P>

<font face="arial" size=2 color=blue>Be advised, your state may require
that you pay tax and you may be limited to the number of cigarettes you
can legally purchase or have in your possession. Check your state laws
before you order cigarettes. Be further advised, that cigarettes are 
harmful to your health and the Surgeon General warns that cigarettes
cause cancer, heart disease and create other health problems.
