When you were linked to this page, if you got here from an old
listing in a search engine or on someone else's site, you probably did so
because it said cigarettes were ONLY $11.95. They were $10.95 before the
price went up.
<p>
In mid-February there was another price increase, this time to $14.95.
The excuse was: <cite>"ALL</CITE> cigarette prices
are going up" but nobody got those cigarettes at $14.95 and many
didn't get their cigarettes at $11.95 either.

"New Marketing Concepts," the company that ran this scheme, 
closed it's doors and kept on debiting members
of the club for cigarettes which were never shipped. Then a new
company, called Native-Blend took over where they left off and they
took about 300 orders before disappearing and that was after everyone's
credit cards got debited through a bar, called the "Hide-Away" in 
Phoenix, Arizona. Now, there are three more clubs (or maybe even more)
who are selling a multi-level marketing plan to deliver cigarettes 
and make it's members very comfortable. Most MLMs don't deliver on their 
promises and most can't even sustain themselves for very long but one
thing is for sure; those at the top make out like bandits. The owners
of these companies have not been prosecuted and may never be. The money
and the companies are gone and there is always someone, somewhere, and
especially on the InterNUT to take their place. 

<p>
By the way, you can buy cigarettes directly from Native-Americans on the
internet (without the MLM) and get them for as low as $8.95 a carton. Look around.
The Winnebagos sell them. The Senecas sell them. And anywhere there is
a Native-American smoke shop they sell cheaper cigarettes for a lot less
than buying them through an MLM club with their membership fees and ultimate failures. <p>

The truth is they all taste like generics. Every once in awhile I get coupons in the mail
and save big time on my cigarettes. I do smoke and probably won't stop. I know they're bad for me, 
but my excuse is a pain condition and besides I like to smoke and you can't live forever anyway.
I wouldn't smoke a generic. If I had to, I'd probably quit. To be honest, my favorite cigarettes
are the same ones I started with when I was old enough to smoke and that is a Lucky Strike without 
filters. Now I buy them and I also buy Marboros. If you appreciate the taste of a good cigarette, 
your probably won't like any of these so-called "native" cigarettes (unless you like smoking hay
or stink weed?)</b></font></td></tr></table><P>
