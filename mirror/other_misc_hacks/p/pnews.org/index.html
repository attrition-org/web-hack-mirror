   Life is great! Don't miss any of it. Create your own time. Enjoy every
   moment. Life is a precious gift. Feel deeply. Enjoy simply. Celebrate
   life. Think freely. Take risks. Fight back. Oppose racism and
   injustice. Also welcome love. Be who you really are because life is
   too short to do otherwise. Be stronger than your condition. Be kind.
   Be supportive. Walk in somebody elses shoes. Do unto others as you
   would have others do unto you. Above all, seek justice. Experience
   Compassion! And, be all you can. And, don't let the bastards grind you
   down. There are a lot of BUBBAS in the world. Just ignore them.
   They're not worth your time. Everything is possible. Just do it! -
   And, carry a big stick, just in case somebody tries to mess with you.
   Honor your parents, they probably did the best they could.</strong>

powered by GNU/Linux, Perl, PHP, and an Apache server. Many web pages are driven by
server side includes (SSI) or other scripting languages for efficiency and
speed. All directory pages and articles are XHTML or being converted from HTML
