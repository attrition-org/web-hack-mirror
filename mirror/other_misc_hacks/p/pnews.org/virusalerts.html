<LI>APStrojan.qa is a trojan that was discovered on January 18, 2000.
It has been reported by users of the America Online Internet service, and for this
reason researchers think the virus was initially spread via email sent to AOL users. The subject line of this
email reads "hey you", and it carries an attachment widely reported to have the name "MINE.EXE."
Once inside a system, the trojan writes four files to the local system and marks them as hidden. These
files then infect various programs and files within the system rendering them inoperable. 
<P><LI>W32/ExploreZip.worm.pak, aka Minizip, is a new, compressed variant of the original W32/ExploreZip.worm. It as a high-risk threat, approaching outbreak levels! It reproduces itself by sending replies to incoming email messages, with itself as an attachment called "zipped_files.exe". 
It includes a payload: it will search the user's mapped drives and overwrite all files of types .c, .cpp, .asm, .doc, .xls, .ppt. to zero Kb. 
<font color=red>IMPORTANT</font> If you receive an email with the message "I received your email and I shall send you a reply ASAP. Till then, take a look at the attached zipped docs.", DELETE IT IMMEDIATELY! <P>
<LI>W32/Mypics.worm - This worm uses mass email for distribution, if executed. It appears to use code similar to W97M/Melissa virus to distribute itself using MS Outlook to the first 50 email recipients, however emails created by this worm do not contain 
a subject line, only the message body of "Here's some pictures for you !" and the email message also has the attached file "Pics4You.exe" with a size of 34,304 bytes.<p> 
<li>There's a new, worldwide virus scare out there called "BubbleBoy."
BubbleBoy is a worm program that hides in email, and is especially
problematic for users of Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express. DO NOT
OPEN any email with "The BubbleBoy incident, picture and sounds" in the
subject line. Delete it immediately. <P><li>W97M/Prilissa is a new Melissa variant, discovered 11/17/99. 
There has been a serious outbreak in Europe, and it is expected to travel quickly. 
W97M/Prilissa infects Word 97 files. It propagates itself by creating an MS Outlook email with the subject line "Message From <Word 97 username>" and the message text "This document is very Important and you've GOT to read this !!!". It sends this message, with an attached copy of the infected Word 97 file, to the first 50 entries in any address book it finds. It does this only once. 
W97M/Prilissa includes a destructive payload! If the date is December 25 of any year, it will modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that the next time the computer is booted, the hard drive will be formatted, causing a loss of all data. <p>
<LI>Back Orifice can take over your computer, but it must either be installed on your computer by someone else, or you have opened an attachment. Never open attachments you receive in your mail. Protect yourself. Go to the Anti-Virus Center. I highly recommend the new 
Norton Security 2000 software. You also get a personal firewall with this software and anti-virus software which will detect and rid you of these malicious viruses. <P>
<li>W32/FunLove.4099 is a parasitic Win32 PE file infector that works on both Win9x and WinNT 4.0. It infects .EXE, .SCR and .OCX files. </OL><P>Scan for these viruses. Update your virus scanning software, and remind your friends to do the same.<P>
