Im getting kind of tired of everyone talking about the kids shooting people up and trying to place blame on so and so, and figure out what everyone could have done to prevent it.
Because the shitty fact of the matter is - some kids are just fucked up. No matter what kind of guidance they receive - theyre fucked up.
