<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Okay to start off, #oneball , www.locusts.org members flat out sucks. You are a bunch of DoS freaks, Fighting gimps , Publicity whores, and Script Kiddies.  99% of you dont even know C, trying to cover up for all your script kiddies in the crew who use named, imapd and mountd exploits all day. Even if you redeface this, you still are nothings. Also untill any of you can code something in C, you are still nothings.Oh and we all fear your sniffing and web page haxxoring skills...It takes real talent to make a cheesy html file.I'm sure we'll see one about this too, cause your egos are at 10 and your skills are at 0.   
          </font></p>


<p align="center"><font size="5">Kiddy &quot;Hacker&quot; GAME OVER. THE SO CALLED #oneball HACKERS AND THE BULLSHIT MEDIA STORIES HAVE BEEN EXPOSED. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080" size="4">This will
probably come off as Abu Sayaff Boys having a big ego but, take it as you
may.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#808080" size="4">Things in quotes

Abu Sayaff Boys' comments are in </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">white</font><font

<p align="center"><font color="#808080" size="3">&quot;A not so clean, poorly lit room and a phone line is all hacker Eyestrain needs.
 &quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Today's so
called hacker... does nothing more then sit for hours trying the
same exploit over and over on many different servers and yes
after a while you will get in.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080" size="3">&quot;Eyestrain is a far cry from the black-garbed, straggly haired hacker that has become a pop culture clichE. His short, black hair is gelled carefully in place and his fashion sense is more eager-intern than Neuromancer.
&quot; </font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Being a socially deprived person, he sure has a sense of vanity. Cheeks as rocky as Mars' surface. Eyes reflecting the gleam of gay porn on his oh-so-slick 19" monitor. A hand covering a face dripping with shame.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080" size="3">&quot;The Philippines has a vast underworld of hackers,
 rooting through the Internet's depths while typical Web users surf the surface. But most of them, like Eyestrain, 
aren't so much malicious as stifled. They have skills, some creative flair and a streak of cybercourage. &quot; </font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Negative. Eyestrain is malicious, he doesn't have skill, he doesnt have
&quot;creative flair&quot; and last, fags don't have a streak of cybercourage (whatever the fuq that means.).</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080">&quotBorn to a poor family in Lucena City in the southern Philippines, Eyestrain first tapped a keyboard when he was 12. His school had just received its first computer, and it was love at first byte.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">He ate a hard disk at age 12?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080">&quot;The classes were disappointing: Eyestrain found that he knew more than his teachers. "They exempted me from classes and got me to help administer the computers," he recalls. &quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">He got to administer computers?Lemme guess, Windows 95?</font></p>


<p align="center"><font color="#808080">&quot;Instead of returning to his backward hometown, however, Eyestrain stayed in Manila and became a cyberthief. By hacking into several e-commerce websites, he has built up a database of hundreds of credit card numbers.  &quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">We have a kid here without
a life. Probably not too many friends at school etc... he goes to
school for 6 hours a day just trying to stay awake during class
because he stayed up late the night before. School is over...
he goes home and start &quot;hacking.&quot; He opens his list
of  sites and begin trying to statd each of them.<br><BR>
statd starnet.net.ph<br>
Exploit failed.<br>
statd i-next.net<br>
Exploit failed.<br>
statd primenet.com.ph<br>
Root Access Gained.<br><BR>
This isn't an actual log of what statd looks like... but you
basically get the point. Any retard could go through 200 servers
and yes eventually one will be statd able. Talk about being a hacker.</font></p>


<p align="center"><font color="#808080">&quot;Eyestrain's friend Hiiro, a more stereotypical geek with Coke-bottle spectacles and a microchip key-chain dangling from his belt, doesn't dabble in credit cards and says he has 'knocked some sense' into his pal. .&quot;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Is this the hacker culture fashion cliche you're talking about?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080">&quot;<B>TIME:</B> What's a packet sniffer?<BR> 
<B>Hiiro:</B> It's a program similar to the one used to catch Kevin Mitnick (one of America's most notorious hackers). It senses when a server is sending passwords and user names to access another server, and it harvests the information and gives it to us. The way the network is set up, once you're in, you're in. 

&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Now we have 2 kids sit and statd'ing hundreds of servers.
Shit that's kinda smart actually doing all the
retarded work with another dumb cockit  and then once they statd'd a server
they would install sniffers! A sniffer! that's might elite lets
tell the world we've hacked them and are watching everything they
do.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080">&quot;Eyestrain -- he doesn't want his real name used –- is a cyber-thief. The 21-year-old is part of a virulent breed of computer hackers in the Philippines, totaling about 1,000 strong, with real grievances, a blurry sense of right and wrong and a knack for stealing passwords and software. Eyestrain alone has hundreds of credit card numbers in his date base.  &quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">God damn that's a lot of
statding eh?Hahaha.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080">&quot<B>Hiiro:</B> About 80% of the ISPs here are insecure. If someone gets hacked into, the ISPs just tell the victims to change their password. Now that doesn't make any sense, or solve the problem. As long as the ISPs server is insecure, we can still easily access the new password. &quot </font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Hiiro has access to 80% of the ISPs!?!? <BR>O my god! That means they
had to type statd a lot of times. Jesus Christ that's a lot of
type.....</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">THE MEDIA SHOULD
BE ASHAMED FOR PRINTING THEIR HYPED EYESTRAIN AND HIIRO HACKER BULLSHIT. YOU
GUYS WERE REALLY DIGGING FOR SOME GOOD OL HACKER STORIES WEREN'T
YOU?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="4">Thank you to
time asia magazine for that enlightening article.</font></p>
