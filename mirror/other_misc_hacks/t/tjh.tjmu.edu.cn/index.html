<b><font size="6">Dear School,

<p><font face="Arial Black"><h1>Bah humbug..you warp the minds of adolesense into thinking the same way

and not letting the vibrant minds of todays youth prospir and create thought generated on its own ideas.

When the student corrects the teacher the student gets detention and scorned by the teacher, but when the

teacher corrects the student they are doing thier job. Take the power back, next time a teacher says

something wrong, speak out and tell them the correct answer. Rise about thinking in the box and elevate

yourself to the next level.</h1></font>
