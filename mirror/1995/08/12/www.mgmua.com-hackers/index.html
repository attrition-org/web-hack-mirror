The <B>premiere</B> hacker conference. <P> <HR> 
<P><B> THEY'VE LIED ABOUT US... ARRESTED US...

<P> This is going to be a lame, cheesy, promotional site for
a movie. 
<P> Nothing more, we're not out to become experts in hacking or
forward your hacks to the FBI. 
<P> We're just looking for interesting scenarios to help us make money 
off of other people.

Hackers, the new <pffft> action adventure movie from those idiots in
Hollywood, takes you inside a world where there's no plot or creative
thought, there's only boring rehashed ideas.  Dade is a half-wit actor
who's trying to fit into his new role.  When a seriously righteous hacker
uncovers MGM's plot to steal millions of dollars, Dade and his fellow
"throwbacks of thespianism,"  Kate, Phreak, Cereal Killer and Lord Nikon,
must face off against hordes of hackers, call in the FBI, and ponder a
sinister UNIX patch called a "trojan."  Before it's over, Dade discovers
his agent isn't taking his calls anymore, becomes the victim of a
conspiracy, and falls in debt.  All with the aid of his VISA card.  Want
the number?<p>

What Kool-Aid was to Jonestown...What the 6502 is to the Cellular 
Telephone Industry...Hackers is to every Cyberpunk movie ever 
made.  Check out the site and see for yourself. <p>
