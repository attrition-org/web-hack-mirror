This is a mirror of Curador's first <a href="/mirror/curador/curador02012000/">page</a>. 
At that time, the only thing on it was the credit
cards from "Shopping Thailand."

There has been rumors floating around, (propagated by none
other than the Reuters News Agency), that Curador managed
to get Bill Gates' credit card information and posted it
on one of his/their sites. This <a href="/mirror/curador/curador02022000">mirror</a>
should put those unfounded rumors to rest. Besides, look at the
pattern of the numbers in the credit card number - 1357? then 2468?
Plus, Bill Gates is "William H Gates Jr." William F Gates is 
his foundation that his father, William H Gates Sr. oversees.
and C'mon. You actually think Microsoft would make Bill Gates' 
phone extension "1" ??
*sigh*

This is the <a href="/mirror/curador/curador02042000/">third mirror</a>. 
Notice that he's added more credit cards and content.

This is the last and final <a href="/mirror/curador/curador03172000/">iteration</a> of
Curador's Web site. Note the amount of credit cards, explanation
of the exploit he allegedly used and a few more rants. This is
a completely different format than the other 2.

NOTE: Yes, we *did* take out the credit cards. We're not THAT stupid ;)
