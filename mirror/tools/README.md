## [ATTRITION Mirror Tools](http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/)

### AGET
'*aget*' is a utility designed by attrition.org staff to mirror web
page defacements. this is an evolving utility that goes several steps
beyond simple mirrors.

for all features, you must have Nmap and Jwhois installed!

(Staff note: This started out as a simple wrapper to wget with a few 
other commands and quickly escalated. Notifying administrators
and CERT type groups proved to be a challenge and headache. Just
trying to do the right thing was not easy. Notice the 
"shared.lists.defaced@cert.org" address for example; that was set up
for our alerts so they could ignore them. We [wrote a blog](https://attrition.org/security/rant/z/jericho.007.html) about
this circus.)
