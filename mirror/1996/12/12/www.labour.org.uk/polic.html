<TITLE>Policy? What policy?</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BACKGROUND="rose.gif">
In the run-up to the coming election, all the political parties,
not just Labour, will be publishing their manifestoes, setting
out how they intend to run the country if they get into power.
Issues like unemployment, crime, taxation and Britain in Europe
will be addressed, with each party claiming that their policy
is what the people want and denouncing what the other parties
have published as being the opposite of what the electorate
wants.
<p>
The simple fact is that the parties will attempt to construct
a manifesto which will garner them the most votes come Election
Day. Labour's proposals for a Windfall Tax on the utilities, and
giving the Lottery franchise to a non-profit organisation are two
examples of minor pieces of policy which are designed to appeal
directly to the man in the street - a kind of a policy soundbite
that candidates can wave at voters like one would entice a dog
with a bone.
<p>
But the fact is, there are much bigger issues which need to be
addressed, such as our country's economic and social problems, which
are a thousand times more important than whether the National Lottery
is run for profit or not.
<p>
As we approach the 21st century, Britain is in crisis. Whether we
like to admit it or not, our country faces immense problems, both
social and economic. Socially, we are on a downward spiral - since
World War II, our population has been continually on the increase,
and Britain is now overpopulated. There simply aren't enough jobs
to go around, and so unemployment is on the increase and, with it,
we see the symptoms of a sick society - crime, drugs and vandalism
are rampant and on the increase.
<p>
Economically, we also face huge problems. Britain joined the Common
Market in order to facilitate trade with our European neighbours,
but now we suddenly find that we're part of a European Union, with
our fellow members attempting to force us to accept federal rule from
Brussels, and a single European currency which would end London's
importance as the world's financial centre. We see France and Germany
dictating to us what we can and cannot do. We see the European Courts
instructing our Government to pay out compensation to the families of
terrorists shot dead while in the process of carrying out a bombing
campaign. We see Germany attempting what it tried in 1914 and again in
1939 - the takeover of Europe, except this time it's doing it through
economic instead of military means. We see French police threatening to
use CS gas on British lorry driver who blockade the roads, whilst standing
idly by while French lorry drivers bring the entire country to a halt.
<p>
For Pete's sake, let's stop letting Brussels dictate what we can and can't
do. We have a veto - we should use it, instead of allowing Germany to
destroy our economy through their puppets in Brussels. Britain's citizens
have the right to self-determination. It's a right guaranteed under the
United Nations. Let's make sure that we keep that right and that we don't
hand control of our economy and, thus our country, to others.
<p>
Issues like a Windfall Tax and who runs the Lottery are minor issues - totally
insignificant in the overall picture. Whoever wins the next election will
most likely, lead Britain into the next millenium. We'd like to see how they
plan do deal with the long-term as well as the short-term problems. And the
fact is, that, if the next government is going to solve the long-term problems,
it's going to have to take drastic and unpopular steps in the short-term. The
problem is, of course, that moves like raising taxes aren't election-winners. But surely
the people of Britain are intelligent enough to see that short-term sacrifices
and hardship are necessary for long-term gain. We aren't children, but we do
want our children to grow up in a better world, and if that means that we have
to make sacifices and pay a few extra pence in the pound in order to help the
Government stabilise the economy, reduce unemployment, fix the NHS and provide
better education for our children, then I think that the majority of the electorate
will be prepared to accept those short-term hardships, in order to ensure that,
down the road, Britain will be a straonger nation and a better place to live.
<p>
The Government is meant to work <i>for</i> the people - <b>All</B> the people;
not just Labour voters or Conservative voters. The various political parties
need to stop being so polarised, and start working together. We are sick and
tired of watching front benchers on both sides of the House trading snide
insults and innuendo with their counterparts on the other side. Instead, why
can't we see a little cooperation? Compromise is a word that doesn't seem to
appear in the political dictionary. What's to stop a Government from
drafting bills and forming Governmental policy in consultation and with
input from the Opposition? That way, we might see some better balanced
legislation and policy that reflects the views of the <i>entire</i> country, instead
of just the majority.
<p>
We are approaching a point at which Parliamentary reform will become a
necessity. It is no longer necessary to elect representatives to vote on
our behalf in the Parliament - the advent of the information superhighway
will mean that every citizen could vote on legislation from their own home.
Kind of like having a series of referendums, voted on electronically. The
question is, will the politicians be willing to give up their positions of
power and hand over that power to make decisions to the electorate. We've
seen how reluctant the current Government is to allow a referendum on Europe.
But don't be fooled either by the Referendum Party which is effectively James
Goldsmith's own private political party, funded directly from his own coffers,
and espousing his own Anglo-French views. If the Referendum Party attains it's
goals, the first person to benefit will be Goldsmith himself. His business
interests would be greatly served by full integration with Europe. The real
question is, would Britain's?
<p>
Our basic message to Labour and the other political parties is this: In the
run-up to the upcoming election, let's see some inelligent and responsible
policies put forward, not just short-term pacifiers like tax-cuts which will
have to be paid for somewhere down the road. If sacrifices have to be made in
order to make this country a better place for us all, then let us know. Inform
us. Tell us the pros and cons of various policies. We don't want to see attacks
on other parties' policies - we want to see reasonable, balanced and informative
debate, not blatant attacks. Too many politicians seem to think that saying
something makes it true. From now on, if a politician says that such-and-such
a party's policies are wrong, we want to hear him back up that assertion with
reasonable argument; and "That's not what the people want!" isn't a reasonable
argument, by the way - what the people want will become clear when the votes
are counted. And, hopefully, when they are counted, the Government which results
will be a better and more responsible one than any previous government, whether
Tory or Labour.
