I did not hack this site in order to cause trouble for 
anyone (except maybe Kriegsman Inc.). I fully understand the responsiblities of a system 
administrator and understand it is a thankless job. This is in no way the administrator's fault 
(or whoever is in control of security at <EM>ShopTheNet</EM>). I tried to do this as 
carefully as I could, in order not to cause any problems for the site administrator(s).  Anyway, 
this was done in the name of animal rights. 
<P>
Today's consumer is completely oblivious to what goes on in order for their product to arrive at the mall for them to buy. 
It is time that the consumer be aware of what goes on in many of today's big industries. Most importantly, the food industries.
For instance, dairy cows are injected with a chemical called BGH that is very harmful to both humans and the cows. This chemical
gives the cows bladder infections. This makes the cows bleed and guess what? It goes straight in to your bowl of cereal. Little does
the consumer know, nor care. The same kind of thing goes on behind the back of fur wearers. The chemicals that are used to
process and produce the fur are extremely bad for our earth. Not only that, but millions of animals are slaughtered for fur and
leather coats. I did this in order to wake up the blind consumers of today. Know the facts.
