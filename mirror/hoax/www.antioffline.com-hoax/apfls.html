<b>Updated</b>: All of the pages have been fixed. So how was this achieved in such a short amount
of time you ask? Sure I'll tell you. What happened from the get was, I redirected output into
another file (original &gt;&gt; replica) which recopied an entire page 3 times through 3 different
sed commands I piped, which is why some pages had three instances of shit, some had two because not
all pages had all three instances I originally wanted replaced... Anyways, after debating on how
was the quickest way to change shit back without doing them all by hand, what I did was, search for
the pages which needed the three instances changed. Then I simply wc -l page divided it by three
then once I obtained that number, it was a piece of cake to automate... <b>for i in `grep
$INSTANCE` ; do echo $i &gt;&gt; CHANGEME</b> then I read all of those filenames and simply
corrected this with sed once again. <b>sed -n '1,469p' FUCKEDFILENAME &gt; /tmp/FIXEDFILENAME</b>
(469 where the numbers of lines in the files once divided by three). If you think thats bad, just
to be a bastard (since I was obviously pissed), I decided to send one of our local (l)users on
AntiOffline stdout output of those 1,000+ files via combos of write/mail/mesg which means he's not
a happy camper. (ever try to cat filename.tar.bz2 | mesg $USER ...) How immature... SysAdmin
101... No more lessons... Anyways back to the news... Stupid news that is, its been updated with
outrageous shit for the day.

I have read volumes about the Cuban Missile Crisis, but nothing about the Cuban Submarine
Crisis. For good reason. That story has never been told.  It is buried in the vaults of the
National Security Agency. I know. I was there, and intimately involved. I have waited almost forty
years to tell this story.  It is long overdue. I believe that the general public has a right to
know and understand what really transpired between President Kennedy and Soviet Premier
Khrushchev: why Kennedy made the decisions that he did during that conflict, and why Khrushchev
backed down. It had a lot more to do with submarines and potential long-range missiles than it had
to do with medium-range ground-based missiles located in Cuba. Never before revealed to the
American public, the Soviet submarine force played a key (if not the major) role in the Cuban
Missile Crisis.</i>

Russia's Banana Party has backed the use of bananas during sex. The change in policy came after
party members decided the fruit could not transmit Aids. Party officials decided to adopt the
change in policy after a heated debate over the practice. African peoples have a long tradition of
ritually deflowering virgins using bananas, the party's state session in Vologda heard. This is
great news for a Russian coffinmaker who was rushed into hospital after his circular saw got caught
up in his trousers. He cut it into 6 pieces (ouch)

Should Jenna Bush, the 19-year-old daughter of the president, be in jail? Or at least be
arrested? That's a conclusion to be drawn from a recent report in the National Enquirer that
asserts she smokes marijuana. After all, some 600,000 Americans are arrested every year for
marijuana possession -- including about 13,000 teenage girls. Some would say, of course, that Jenna
Bush shouldn't be hassled for allegedly smoking pot, but then maybe nobody else should either.

useful, and for those that don't, and have some time to spare, there are links for newbies, all the

Seals are being saved by Viagra because the pill has replaced the animal's penis as an oriental
sex aid. Powdered male seal genitalia was the preferred remedy for a flagging
sex life among billions of men in Asia. Now more and more are turning to Viagra and the trend has
resulted in decreasing culls of seals, according to research. The number of seals taken in the
world has fallen dramatically. (We thought it was funny)

How Joe Desch, based in Dayton, beat the Nazi code and helped win the war<br><br><i>
Debbie Anderson knew in the summer of 1986 that time was running out for her 79-year-old
father. After a series of small strokes and then a broken hip, Joe Desch, a man of iron
independence, was forced to recuperate in a Kettering nursing home. There he took with him the
painful secret he had kept coiled inside for most of his life. "He seemed still to be fighting
battles that should have been settled years ago," Anderson said. "There were little things that
would set him off on tirades." Anderson knew only that her father's pain and anger were tied to the
World War II codebreaking research he had done at Dayton's National Cash Register Co. the work that
had driven him to a nervous breakdown, but which he had never been able to talk about, not even to
explain the Congressional Medal for Merit he had received for his war service.</i><br><br>

Rep. Bob Goodlatte does not want you to go to the linked article. The conservative Virginia
Republican, who is co-chairman of the Congressional Internet Caucus, hopes to punish the
publication or redistribution of columns such as this with a $15,000 fine and up to one year
in federal prison.  Why? Because the article includes a short Perl program that could be used to
spam -- and it seems certain to be banned under a bill that Goodlatte has recently introduced. 
<i>Personally we couldn't care if spammers went to jail however, jailing someone for posting their

Someone has taken the time to delve deep into the coding of the NSA's version of Linux and offer a
summation of it all. The article is short, not so to the point, but its rather nice to see anyone
digging into the code at all. Personally we wonder why the NSA and Big Brother released this
version of Linux provided every other week they claim how bad <i>hackers</i> all over the world are
making it hard for them (Big Brother) to keep tabs on them. Shit they even claim Osama bin Laden
has higher technology then they (NSA) do. So why unleash a product (which anyone can
download) which can help their enemies? I guess thats the "Enemy of the State" side of my brain
writing.

Scientists all over the world weren't prepared to assess any of the damages caused by the Russian

the casualties of the Mir space station, what the censors will not show. The article is not for the
