	This server has been hacked by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in
	retaliation for the millions of hackers who visit this infested security
	website in efforts to circumvent Internet security, making our jobs more
	difficult.

	No longer will government tolerate the actions of malicious hackers in this
	world, as we will begin to fight fire with fire until the entire country is
	under our command, and the annihilation of computer programmers, and those
	responsible for introducing security incidents are brought to justice.

	No longer will you read news from sites like these as we begin taking back
	by force, what hackers have taken using exploits by the likenesses of gurus
	such as @stake, RFP, Core-SDI, PacketNinja.net, Dragos, and those responsible
	for the creation of the "HoneyNet Project."

	Owned by Big Brother.
