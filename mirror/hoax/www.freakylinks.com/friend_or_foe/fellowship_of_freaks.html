<B>Peruse a listing of some of the finer sites I've found on the World Wide Weird.   Some are relevant to Freaky Links and some aren't, but all are worth a look see.  And most of them have real pretty pictures to look at.</B><p>

<a href="http://www.psyhigh.com" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Psychic High</B></font></a><BR>
So I got sent this link and I thought it was amusing and as a joke I told the guy I would link to it if he would name one of his campus buildings after me.  Well what-do-ya-know, he went and did it.  Take a gander at the only high school devoted to those with a little "something extra" up there in the frontal lobe.<p>

<a href="http://no-such.net/WORK" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>No Such Net</B></font></a><BR>
I got this link e-mailed to me and I gotta say it kept me entranced for minutes (which considering my attention span is a pretty marvelous thing.)  It's a free form abstract sorta thing so don't go in expecting to learn something.
Instead just keep pushing the buttons and see where you end up.<p>

<a href="http://www.iwannabefamous.com/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>I Wanna Be Famous</B></font></a><BR>
Ever want those 15 minutes that Andy Warhol said you deserved?  Aim your browser on over to this site and make it big!  Or you can just do what I did and chuckle at the people who think that fame would solve all their problems.<p>

<a href="http://www.bored.com/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Bored</B></font></a><BR>
Their slogan is "when you have nothing better to do" and since that's the story of my life, how could I say no?  It's a link clearinghouse that clicks thru to some of the weirder sights on the net so it might behoove you to go on over
there and check 'em out.  They were kind enough to put me on their list (course I'm under "dumb") Oh well, any publicity is good publicity.<p>

<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~cyclonepub/sonsmarv.html" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>The Sons of Lee Marvin</B></font></a><BR>
Read about this secret society that counts Tom Waits and Jim
Jarmusch as members!<p>

<a href="http://www.flightdata.com/ht_lawnchairman.html" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>The Lawn Chair Pilot</B></font></a><BR>
The incredible true story of Larry Walters who strapped 45 helium weather balloons to a lawn chair, got into it and then launched himself to 16,000 feet where he was finally spotted by pilots of a commercial passenger jet.  The best
part of the site is the real audio recordings of him trying to explain to Federal authorities that he's in a lawn chair floating above their airport!<p>

<a href="http://www.milkyelephant.com/indexme.html" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>MilkyElephant.com</B></font></a><BR>
Some of the most outlandish cartoon animation you ever did see! (There's the southern hick in me coming out)  You could spend hours on this page just uncovering what goes on in the mind of chief animator Mumbleboy.  Worth a look!<p>

<a href="http://www.occultresearch.com/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Occultresearch.com</B></font></a><BR>
My brother Adam's website that was started in 1994 and has been inactive since his death in 1997.  Adam was interested in mysticism and primitive magic but took a much more serious look at it. (He had a bachelor of arts degree in both psychology and parapsychology and a masters in anthropology.)  Some of the wording gets too geeky for me but it's a great place to start if you looking to get into the more scientific angle of paranormalism.  I've preserved it in the state it was left.<p>

<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Atlantis/7890/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Monster Freaks</B></font></a><BR>
Here's what things looked before Lan came down and showed me what the letters HTML really stood for.  This was my first attempt at a freaky website and I've preserved it so future historians can look upon my intial efforts and shake their heads in disbelief.<p>

<a href="http://www.forteantimes.com/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Fortean Times</B></font></a><BR>
The granddaddy of them all. The magazine this site is based from was named for Charles Fort who lived from 1874 to 1932. Fort's biggest accomplishment was compiling news stories of the odd and strange that were scattered all over the world and throughout history books into a series of books.  Fortean Times was first published in 1973 to continue his research and is an amazing database of the strange.  If you like my site I urge you to get a subscription to this United Kingdom based magazine.<p>

<a href="http://www.5sigma.com/joseph/inan/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Joseph's Inanimate Objects</B></font></a><BR>
Joseph is a guy with lots of firearms, a bag full of groceries and a video camera.  Ever wonder what a bottle of red cherry soda looks like when it's hit with a 9mm hollow point?  Here's the place to find out.<p>

<a href="http://www.eddiebreen.com/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>The Eddie Breen Experience</B></font></a><BR>
Eddie is not your ordinary folk artist. He uses such paranormal themes of fire people, aliens, flying Jesus formations and other oddities to make his statements on canvas.  Much of his work is Piggyback Art in which he takes a existing painting found at a thrift store or yard sale and reinvents it by adding his own take on the subject.  If you ever thought folk art was all about badly painted calico cats check out Eddie and he'll change your mind.<p>

<a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/index.html" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Roadside America</B></font></a><BR>
The place to find unique attractions in these 50, nifty, United States.  Everyone should know about the amazing beer drinking goat of Lajitas TX, where the Museum of Death is located at and what animal spit up the world's largest hairball (it was a hog and the 2 1/2 pound curio is on display in Mt. Angel, Oregon.  Take a hypertour and see the sights without ever leaving the comfort of your doublewide.<p>

<a href="http://www.discovery.com/cams/rat/ratmain.html" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>The Naked Mole Rat Cam</B></font></a><BR>
I get a lot of e-mails that complain that my web cams are a bit boring (is it my fault that the skunk ape ain't dancing the hootchie koo in front of the lens?) Here's a web-cam that will appease everyone craving for action. And what action it is, naked mole rats scurrying left, naked mole rats scurrying right, naked mole rats sleeping with the naked mole rat legs sticking straight up in the air.  Action! Action! Action!<p>

<a href="http://www.flyvision.org/sitelite/Houston/GhostWatcher/index.html" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>June Houston's GhostWatcher</B></font></a><BR>
Another web-cam page that overlaps the paranormal with the artistic.  June's an artist living in NYC with a ghost problem in her home so she has placed a dozen or so cameras in her house and invites visitors to watch the images and report what they see.  The compilation of reports makes for interesting reading and the site blurs the line between reality and art.<p>

<a href="http://urbanlegends.about.com" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Urban Legends and Folklore</B></font></a><BR>
A great source to track down the truth behind those ugly e-mail chain letters about Bill Gates paying you to test his e-mail tracking program (it ain't so)  Urban Legends use to be oft told tales about alligators in the sewers but with the popularity of the web and e-mail, these tales have taken on a new twist. This site gets to the bottom of what's true and what's not plus is updated frequently.  Next time someone e-mails you with the recipe to the Neiman Marcus cookie, e-mail them back with this web site address.<p>

<a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>The Smoking Gun</B></font></a><BR>
Uses the Freedom of Information act for great entertainment effect.  Official crime reports, court documents and government paperwork are all shown here to expose what "they" don't want you to see. Current stories up when I visited was the rap sheet for a Pokemon related arrest, Parker Stevenson's court files on why Kristie Alley should pay him child support and the death certificate of Andy Kaufman.<p>

<a href="http://www.improb.com/index.shtml" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>The Annals of Improbable Research</B></font></a><BR>
The site describes itself as a scientific humor magazine and it fits the bill.  Current reports expose "the win a date with a Nobel laureate" contest, review the first opera based on cloning research and awards a prize to the first car anti-theft device that incorporates a flame-thrower.  Basically it's Mad magazine as written by Isaac Newton.<p>

<a href="http://www.the-void.dk/incident/intro.html" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>The Incident</B></font></a><BR>
I got this e-mailed to me by a Freakylinks reader named Adam who used verbs such as "creepy", "vague" and "bizarre" when he described it.  Does it live up to those words of praise?  Well let's just say it gives a whole new spin on the "Oswald didn't act alone" theory.  Check it out.<p><BR>
