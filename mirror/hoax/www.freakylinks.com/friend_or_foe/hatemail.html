<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>YOUR A PHYSCO PERSON</B></font><p>
I DONT BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU SAY. ITS A BUNCH OF BULL CRAP.
YOUR A PHYSCO PERSON, AND I THINK, I SAID I THINK THAT YOU
NEED SOME SERIOUS MENTAL HELP. IM SORRY IF THIS MAY SOUND A
LITTLE CRUEL BUT YOUR AN IDIOTIC PERSON WHO LIES AND BY
GUESSING , YOUR AN UGLY COMPUTER GEEK. IT WOULD BE NICE IF
YOU WROTE BACK TO ME, BUT THEN AGAIN YOUR MGHT BE TOOOO
GEEKEY WORKING ON YOUR WEBSITE. BUT HEY, IF YOU WRITE
BACK...... I GUESS UR NOT AS BIG A GEEK I THINK YOU ARE.<p>

TAKE CARE<BR><BR><BR>



<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>FreakyLinks has some major problems.</B></font><p>
Derek<br>
FreakyLinks has some major problems.<br>
The first being  that your putting this hype into scaring us
and all that is on this site is just plain tabloid magazine
bulls**t.  If you say your going to scare me then actually
try to.  Don't just put silly s**t on here.  The other big
problem was with those pictures, they  sucked.<p>
                                                                          
HardCore Freak<BR><BR><BR>



<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>your s***ty site</B></font><p>
What the f*** is this? You call this an informative site? freakylinks is 
nothing but another Cutsey-Wutsey piece of s***....Everything from your very 
dumb content, very unoriginal and uninspiring, to your blatent attept to 
profit with the f***ing freak store. You even ripped off Spring-Heel Jack!! 
Now stupid people who actual find your site to be "new" will associate 
Spring-Heel Jack with this dumbass site!! I wish I could meet you in person 
so I could pummel you in the F***ING FACE over and over. You make 
metaphysical experiences and phenomenon seem like pretend just so you can 
appeal to the masses and not the thin cross-section that is interested in 
actual instances of paranormal events.<BR><BR><BR>


<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>A Classic One</B></font><p>
your site is all a hoax and your linx to who@who.ky is a
joke and a waste of time. what really pisses me off is that
i wasted so much time reading into your s***ty site and
actually believing that you had some cool stuff. believe me
this is the last time i waste my time on something crammed
with nothing but cheap gimmeckry (sp?) . if you want to own
a dog and pony show at least have class. like pt barnum said
a sucker is born every minute. i sure feel like a sucker
just for being curious about your site.<BR><BR><BR>



<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>your site sucks</B></font><p>

Derek,
your site sucks yuo reaterd
i cvant even spell and im too mature for yoy crappy site
so you can bite me<BR><BR><BR>



<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>you are what is wrong...</B></font><p>
... with serious scientific efforts to investigate the parnormal. I have a PhD in parapsychology from University of California at Irvine, and I have been investigating serious documented cases for the last 15 years. I have interviewed hundreds of eyewitnesses and spoken to law officials from all over the country. I know better than anyone how devastating it is to the field every time yet another one of them turns out to be a fraud or just simple ignorance.<p>
The Internet makes what you do here even more dangerous - you publish findings with no systematic fact checking or verification and you encourage people to fuel this fire with wild speculation!  Anyone could find this and think it was a serious, instead of a pile of conspiracy babble and ignorant redneck drivel (yes, they can sometimes sound the same - the difference is the facts behind the words).<p>
If you do seriously care about investigating the paranormal, I urge you to take down this damaging web site. If you want to contribute to the field, consider supporting established organizations that can actually accomplish something of value.<BR><BR><BR>

<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Fish Fall in Ogre Cam</B></font><p>

Hi there,<p>

I was watching the <a href="freakopedia/tails_of_the_crypto/ogre.html"><B>ogre cam</B></a> one day when I was surprised to see a huge rain of fish start! I captured the image and here's a copy. What do you think the odds are?<p>

 . . . .And if you believe that then I have some land in the everglades to see you.<p>

This picture that I made in 20 minutes with photoshop just goes to prove that you can't trust anything you see or read on here.  Anything and everything you post can be made up by anyone with half a brain and a computer. Yes, that includes you.<p>

I'd go off on a rant but you seem to be the master of that, huh Derek? Guess you will just keep on deluding all these people with your lies.<p>

Bet you don't even have the guts enough to print this.<p>

Signed,<BR>
A non-fan<BR><BR><BR>

<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Weekly World News</B></font><p>

Sigh,<p>

More of the same ol believe anything b***s*** that one finds everywhere on the web these days...<p>

Whatever happened to rationality?  Whither, the scientific method.  Your whole approach seems to be "Hey, it's KEWL...who cares about objective truth?"<p>

You realize that there are people unbalanced enough to shape their lives around some of this stuff...All people like you do is feed their psychosis.  The Heaven's Gate thing and others like it can be laid squarely at the feet of people like you!<BR><BR><BR>


<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>My Daddy Told Me</B></font><p>

My daddy once told me; "If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a
duck...then it must be a duck"...<p>

Well, in your case, you sure as hell seem like a f***in' communist
d***head, and I bet you and your friends have a real fun time spreading b***s*** rumors and raping babies in your feces smeared geek house. I hope that A real man gets elected into Washington, and passes a law that keeps putrid dungeon masters like you and all your butt buddies from spreading your vile b***s*** around this fine country of ours.<p>

I hope you know that there's a whole lot of folks that feel this way in these parts....<p>

-You will burn in hell....<BR><BR><BR>
