<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Hey there from Lakeport, FL!</B></font><p>
<img src="friend_or_foe/loveskunk.jpg" width=164 height=240 border=0 align="left" hspace="10">
Derek,<p>
I would first like to tell you that I love your site, and even though its practically my back yard, I watch the ogre cam for about 6 hours a night. (a little more on the weekend, that is if I don't have to get up early to go fishin.) Well I thought I would send you of picture of myself, and something that is well a little top secret.<p>
My daddy gave that thing in my hand and he swears that it is the head of the skunk ape. Anyways, I don't know, and I'm scared to tell anybody. I mean if Jim Smith at the fish camp where the webcam is located at ever found out that my paw shot the skunk ape, I'm not sure if he would make any money on his tours and I doubt Mable would be able to sell any more of the "I saw skunkie!" t-shirts. I figured If I am going to expose it though, It might as well be a Freakylinks exclusive. Well I'll let ya go, I am sure you have more important things to read than this.<BR><BR><BR>


<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>About Your Site</B></font><p>
Dear Derek,<p>
I usually don't write strangers and let them know how I feel, but I felt really compelled by a lot of personal reasons to do just that. I have been "lurking" as they say, on your freaky links site for a many months now, and I am continually amazed at the vast amount of information that you have amassed, and the honest (and entertaining) way you disseminate (sp?) it to the internet public.<p>
I will continue to be informed and entertained by you as long as (god willing) you can keep the site going.<BR><BR><BR>


<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>another fan letter</B></font><p>
I know you must get these all of the time -- I lurk on the <a href="friend_or_foe/discuss/discuss.cgi"><B>Freakylinks boards</B></a>, so I know how enthusiastic your "fans" are -- but I wanted to write and say thanks for the site. It's really great! I took a few classes in folklore back at Western Kentucky University (one of the only places where you can get a degree in folklore, actually), and I'm still fascinated by urban legends, and even more fascinated by the people that believe in them. Wish your site had been around 15 years ago -- I could have used some of its material for class!<p>
Thanks again -- you are a bright young man, and I think you will go far.<BR><BR><BR>


<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>A child again</B></font><p>
Freakylinks has become so important to me that I had to write and thank you and tell you how your/ our site has changed my life.  For the better. Seriously.<p>
The internet is where I spend most of my "free" time because my indulgence in it relies only on my daughters and my work's schedule.  Where it can go and what it can satisfy (horny internet wingding) I was over with by Prodigy service in 93'.  The Internet can be whatever it can be for a single person, and reliably it has a part of my life for Entertainment for almost a decade now, (since I was a wee teen lolita without two children and hooked on a guy that romantically wanted to name our children Shiffobra and Payola Mafia
back at the old school).  The Internet was a distraction for me.  But now it's something different with places like yours to visit.  It RELIEVES me to see other people who are consummed with superstition, oddity, and conspiracy.  It makes me feel ALIVE to see other people who use science, reason, and experience to reach out to other people and expose their questioning selves.  To walk away without answer but still have been brave enough to participate in the unknowing.  Besides the guys that want t-shirts of MonsterFreaks and spring heeled jack, there are some of us that get something else and appreciate the gift.<p>
I want to acknowledge that Freakylinks lets me be a child
again and reclaim amazement, as it does for many people for a million reasons.  It lets me know every day that We are not in Control, and more people around me than I am aware of know this. <BR><BR><BR>


<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Luv</B></font><p>
Derek,<p>
Your site is the best thing since the alien autopsy!! Love it.<BR><BR><BR>


<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Love the site</B></font><p>
Hey Derek,<p>
Congratulations on the awesome site.  It really captures the spirit of Charles Fort and all that he lived and died for.   You just don't find this kind of enthused, open-minded inquiry on the net.  Everyone seems to have his own agenda.  Thanks for giving me and others a place I can go to keep up with the latest phenoms.  Keep it up!<BR><BR><BR>


<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Saludos desde el soleado Mexico</B></font><p>
<img src="friend_or_foe/masked_wrestler.jpg" width="320" height="218" border="0" align="right" hspace="10">
Hola Derek,<br>
Saludos desde el soleado Mexico.  Todos aqu&iacute; en la federacion de
lucha libre esperamos con ansias cada nueva entrada a tu 'website'.  S&oacute;lo espero que puedas hacer m&aacute;s segmentos acerca de todas las cosas interesantes que tenemos aqu&iacute; tus vecinos del sur.  Sab&iacute;as que Mexico tiene uno de los m&aacute;s altos porcentajes de visiones de platillos voladores en todo el mundo? Si tienes la oportunidad de visitarnos te alojaremos en la casa de mi abuela.  Te prometo que ella no va a sufrir de combusti&oacute;n espont&aacute;nea. (ja ja)<p>
Tu amigo<br>

<font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>From a fan...</B></font><p>
I just thought I would let you know that I am not much for all this computer
junk but I really like your website!  May I suggest a section on religious
miracles and  visions?  I've looked in vain, also, for a truly skeptical
voice in relation to science and technology (to quote the new Steely Dan CD,
"Call Your Doctor, Call Your Shrink, Western Science She Strictly
Rinky-dink..."  Maybe your website can fill a need in that regard.<p>
A word of caution, though...although not truly dangerous, there are those
who think that they are.  Try not to too obviously tread on their toes.
Look what happened to Jean Robin...<p>
By the way, I live in Nevada City California up in
the beautiful Gold Country of the Sierra Foothills, and I am a member of the
Naqshibandi Sufi Order.  Our Master, Maulana Shaykh Nazim, is really the
stuff.  Check out our award winning web-sites at <a href="http://naqshbandi.org/"><b>naqshbandi.org</b></a>.<p>
All of my best!<p>

Not the Mad Arab, I assure you<p>
Allthough, I did visit H. P. Lovecraft's grave...Strange story, that...<BR><BR><BR>
