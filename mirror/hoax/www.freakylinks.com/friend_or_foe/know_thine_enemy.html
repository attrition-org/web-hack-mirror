Did you know that Santa Claus is a demon?  Did you know that stuffed animals should be burned to prevent demonic influence?  Did you know that when electronics misfunction it's because of demons?  Learn all this and more at Demon Busters!  Plus as an added bonus they've got a rockin' score!<p>

<a href="http://www.timecube.com/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Timecube</B></font></a><BR>
I'm sure the owner of this website is trying to make some kind of statement I'm just not sure what it is.  In the faithful fashion of most conspiracy web sites this one is all one long page and it's just chock full of stuff hidden
from the public until now. (or at least that's what the author says) Enter at your own risk, this one gave me a headache.<p>

<a href="http://www.who.ky/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Who is Who?</B></font></a><BR>
No, it's not an AC/DC tribute page but something a little more sinister. I won't go into details about what you find on here but keep playing with it and something interesting will happen.  In fact the more you play with it the more interesting it gets.  WARNING:  When I say interesting I mean it in a very dark way, Don't go here if you are looking for fluffy bunny quicktimes and recipes on making cookies.  Whoever (pun intended) has this website seems to be a little on the paranoid side (and is intent on making you paranoid as well)<p>

<a href="http://www.freakylinks.com/friend_or_foe/jerzeyboyz.html" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>The Jerzey Boyz</B></font></a><BR>
Sometime over the weekend of February 25-27th 2000,  Freakylinks was hacked and our hub page replaced with a new one.  The damage was repaired quickly but as Jim Jones liked to say (or at least I saw this on a plaque above Powers Booth's head when he played Jim in the tv-movie) "Those that forget the past are doomed to repeat it."  With that in mind here's a link to what the hacked page looked like on that fateful weekend.<p>

<a href="http://www.acquire-gm.com/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Acquire-GM.com</B></font></a><BR>
I don't know much about these guys other than what the front page says. (which is the only page you can go to on the website.  If you e-mail them you get a nice letter back asking about what you have.  I think that anyone who collects paranormal trinkets should be willing to share the wealth with others But that doesn't seem to be the case with this company.  I don't like it. Not one little bit.<p>

<a href="http://www.funone.com/funone/eggs/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Egg Party</B></font></a><BR>
I hate eggs. I hate bad computer music.  I hate bad animation. I hate cute.  I hate bad puns.  I really hate badly animated cute eggs dancing to bad computer music with bad puns to explain them.  There's a level in Hell where sinful web surfers are forced to watch this page for all eternity.<p>

<a href="http://www.blairwitch.com/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>The Blair Witch Project</B></font></a><BR>
I hated this movie. The camera work made me physically ill and the climax was about as frightening as finding out the milk had curdled in the fridge.  I also hated how the filmmakers tried to blur the line between reality and fantasy.  The last thing paranormal investigators need is hundreds of drunk frat guys trying to find the Blair Witch out in the woods.  The success of this intertwining of fact and fiction only means that we'll be blessed with tons more of this type of crap in the future. It makes me shudder.<p>

<a href="http://www.imaginationinternet.com/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>The American Computer Company</B></font></a><BR>
Would you buy a computer from a company that believes the transistor was reversed engineered from a crashed UFO?  In 1998 this company announced they were close to unveiling a computer with a 90 GB hard drive that used alien "trans-capacitor technology" with no moving parts.  The Men in Black must have paid them a visit since then because the patent application has since been withdrawn. Go to the website and learn the secret government conspiracy that is hampering the advancement of computer geeks all over the world.<p>

<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~alexycchiu2/index.htm" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Alex Chiu</B></font></a><BR>
Here's the homepage of the world's smartest man since Edison and Einstein (he compares himself with them on the first page) Alex must be a busy boy since he's already invented teleportation and immortality and is working on devices to cure the handicap.  He also answers that pesky question of "What is God?"  Too bad his grammar skills aren't on par with the rest of his thinking.<p>

<a href="http://www.jimjacobson.com/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Jim Jacobson's home page</B></font></a><BR>
Quite possibly the worst web page ever designed.  Jim has stuffed every bell and whistle onto a web-site that serves no meaningful purpose other than to make your computers arteries clog down with information cholesterol.  Jim works in psychiatry at a hospital and that alone is enough to scare the hell out of me.<p>

<a href="http://www.tldm.org/" target="outside"><font size=3 color="#CCFF99"><B>Virgin Mary's End-Times Prophecies</B></font></a><BR>
One day Veronica Leuken began having visitations from Jesus and the Virgin Mary who would speak through her about the evils of communism and homosexuality. Veronica was also told to warn everyone that a giant "Ball of Redemption" was
hurtling through space and destined to destroy the earth. Her website chronicles these visions and reveals intricate details of what only she could see.  Ever wonder what kind of shoes Jesus wears?  It's revealed here!<p>
