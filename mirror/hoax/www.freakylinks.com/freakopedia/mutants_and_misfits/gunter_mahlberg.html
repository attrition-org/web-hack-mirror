<br><font size="5"><b>The Evil Gunter Mahlberg</b></font><p>

I've had <a href="http://www.acquire-gm.com/" target="outside"><b>acquire-gm.com</b></a> listed on my "<a href="friend_or_foe/know_thine_enemy.html"><b>know thine enemy</b></a>" page for quite some time.  I put them there just because I thought that collecting paranormal phenomenon without sharing your findings with the public was the wrong thing to do.  I had no idea I was just seeing the tip of the iceberg. Lemme explain....<p>

Before I left for my California trip I got this e-mail:<p>

<blockquote>
Yo, Derek ...<p>

Jersey Boyz ain't shit, man. Buncha wannabe script kiddies. You got dudez on
your side too, brotha. We watching your back and keeping an eye on your
enemies. Want the inside deal on that punk ass acquire-gm.com you have listed on your enemy page? We've had our hooks in his server, real subtle like. Doesn't suspect a thing. We got two months of his email sitting in a zip file ready to send you if you want it. He's
more AND less than you think.<p>

Sp01lr & T-Jazz<p>

------------------------------------------------------------
</blockquote><p>

I replied thanking them for the offer but I didn't think it was that easy to get into his server.  They promptly e-mailed me back.<p>

<blockquote>
Derek--<p>

Doubt us if want, man, but you still gonna blow when you see this shit. It
only took a few days with an IP sniffer to catch a login. Wasn't the root,
but good enough to get us in. Then it was easy to get to root password
(gotta luv those Linux machines). Not much in the web directories, no real
dirt to speak of. Just a punky little server, but not like an ISP deal with
a whole buncha crap on one machine. Freak likes his privacy.<p>

Poked through the undelivered email and they were talking some crazy shit.
So we patched the SMTP and POP servers to make copies of everything going
thru to the root mailbox -- we were seeing EVERYTHING, dude!<p>

Maybe they are just sickos, but Gunther and his crew ain't no boyscouts.
Talking all kinds of smack, might have really waxed some folks to add to his
"collection"! Check out these emails we lifted. You tell US if this shit
looks legit.<p>

Looks like he's got something cooking soon, and we figure you are the only
person wack enough to check it out. Just make sure to give us our props for
the hack, dude.<p>

L8r - Sp01lr & T-Jazz
</blockquote><p>

So at this point I was faced with an ethical dilemma.  "Sp01lr and T-Jazz" (why can't hackers ever have normal names like "Bob" or "Tom"?) had sent me a huge pile of e-mails that they had illegally obtained.  I thought long and hard about deleting it without a second glance but something made me want to look.  I thought about it, thought about it some more and then finally made up my mind to be an accomplice and I started reading them....<p>

I was amazed at what I found out.<p>

Acquire-gm.com has to be the biggest obtainer of paranormal phenomenon in the U.S. if not the entire world.  The casual ease described in the e-mails on how they throw money around makes me envious.  Trust me boys and girls, if I had this kind of money I wouldn't be driving to California in a company truck with Jason.<p>

But wealth and determination is just the half of it.  The real news is the way the company goes about getting items.  They are ruthless with a capital R.  Reading through these e-mails took me into a world where the end justifies the means.  For Acquire-Gm.com (and it's owner Gunter Mahlberg) nothing stands in the way of possessing any item that is deemed worthy of "the collection."<p>

I've documented several of the more damning e-mails below but before you read them you need to know the men behind the madness.  Reading between the lines there seems to be three major participants in Acquire-GM.com<p>

Gunter Mahlberg He's the headcheese, CEO and the GM in Acquire-GM.com.  It's evident in these e-mails that Gunter is a well-placed and wealthy man, able to sponsor several worldwide "expeditions" at once.  I would have thought that such a man would have more of a public record but I've only been able to discover a few facts about him.  According to a US Department of State he was born somewhere in Germany (or at least that is the country he initially applied for a passport to the United States from) I believe he owns a private jet and maintains offices in Los Angeles, New York, London, and Berlin.  I don't know where his home is but judging from the information in the e-mails it must be one hell of a swank place.  One interesting fact is that he's reported to be a midget. (his height is listed as 4 feet 2 inches on his visa) Historically midgets have been considered a part of the paranormal pantheon and this may explain why Gunter is interested in collecting this stuff.  It does not explain why he goes about it in such a ruthless manner.<p>

Daniel McArthur - He appears to be Gunter's right hand man and the one who owns the inquire@acquire-gm.com's e-mail address.  He travels extensively for Gunter and seems to be a whipping boy for Gunter's rage when something goes wrong.<p>

Carmichael - I'm not sure if it's his first or last name and I think I don't want to meet him face to face to find out.  He seems to be the one that gets called when something goes wrong and at one point Daniel McArthur even calls him "Mr. Fixit"  (And I don't think that's because he's a good car mechanic.)<p>

There's some other shady individuals involved as well but these three seem to be the top animals on the food chain, with Gunter being the top dog of all.<p>


But what makes Gunter Mahlberg tick?  The e-mails reveal a man who is accustomed to getting what he wants.  Here are some of the highlights:<p>

On a staff members recommendation that one object isn't worth "the trouble" being made by the current owner, Gunter writes:<p>

<blockquote>
"I do not care one whit about any problems, real or imagined.  It is only trouble if I say it is.  You will proceed with securing the validity of that book and then you will bring it to me.  If the current owner does not want to cooperate then you are authorized to find other avenues that lead to me possessing the tome.  Do not disappoint me."
</blockquote><p>

On finding out that a map he purchased is a fake.<p>

<blockquote>
"Damn her!  I'll have her f***ing head mounted on a wall as a trophy... Daniel you are an ass not to have found this out before hand.  Have Carmichael call me as soon as possible to discuss with me what sort of options I have.  I'll be damned if I'm going to be made the fool of by some old crone living in the Whitfield countryside."
</blockquote><p>

On his business policy<p>

<blockquote>
"I've said this before and I will pound it into your head again; There is nothing that should stand in our way.  When I decide on a course of action it should be carried thru with the urgent most expediency.  While I realize that problems will arise, they only become my problems when you do not handle them. And let me be perfectly clear:  If you can not handle them then I will find someone else who can."
</blockquote><p>

Certainly these e-mails paint a picture of a man who has no moral or ethical standards that get in the way of obtaining any item he desires.  But other e-mails raise the question of possible criminal misconduct.<p>

From May 4th:<p>

<blockquote>
"I do not foresee a problem with customs in Haiti. Carmichael has that well under control and can fill you in with the specifics. I expect it to be in my hands no later than the 18th."
</blockquote><p>

From July 2nd in an e-mail sent to Gunter from Daniel McArthur<p>

<blockquote>
"A bigger issue is getting it out of Tasmania.  This is no 3rd world shit-hole and that coupled with the problems of caring for such a wild animal is making delivery a little more difficult than we anticipated.  Any chance of OKing Carmichael to come down and help out with any possible problems?  Otherwise delivery may be delayed."
</blockquote><p>

From July 17th  again from Daniel McArthur<p>

<blockquote>
"I know it's down here somewhere.  I've already found evidence that it was not destroyed in the museum fire and was sold to a man named Keppler in 1904.  He displayed in at his home in Franklin Tennessee until at least the 1930's.  Unless it hopped across state and back into that Indian's grave I'm betting it's still floating around here somewhere. I have a few more leads and plenty of cash left so I'll let you know the moment something rears it's head."
</blockquote><p>

This last one was most interesting to me since it mentions an Indian grave and possession of Native American relics has been a federal crime under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act since 1990 That's right boys and girls, a FEDERAL CRIME.<p>

With all this information now I was really interested in putting a face to this Gunter Mahlberg.  Luckily one of the later e-mails had mentioned that he was doing research at the downtown Los Angeles public library.  So, I took it upon myself to hang out at the place for a couple of days and see if I could find a wealthy, mean looking midget to take a picture of.  I wasn't disappointed.<p>

</center><p>

So here's the man behind the myth and now you know the whole story. Below is a large selection of the e-mails I was sent.  I no longer feel that it was wrong of me to look at them since by doing so I've uncovered what I think is a shady business whose motives are questionable at best.  Buying paranormal items for yourself is one thing, but when you go about it in the aggressive style that Acquire-gm.com does then you have crossed the line.<p>

If any of you have been contacted by Acquire-gm.com I urge you to stay away from them.  They're definitely up to no good and you might soon find yourself on the wrong end of bad business deal.<p>

Mikhail has found the totem and is making arrangements for packing.  Because of the weight he recommends that it go by ship to a harbor and then be picked up by truck and taken to your home.  That raises the question of customs.  I've been dealing strictly with the air carrier and didn't think of having to use a ship company.  Any recommendations?<p>

Here's the latest info:<p>

As you know Marcus has found the wreckage.  The submersible finally became available for use on the 1st and it's been confirmed that the markings on the wreckage match the ones that Lt. Charles Taylor had on his aircraft.<p>

The next problem is going to be getting the wreckage up out of the water.  At that depth Marcus has his doubts on how much can be recovered.  I've told him that if he needed to bring in more of people it was fine but that they should be hired from the islands and not from the US.  I'm keeping in touch with him and will let you know when he has more information.<p>

I've also got work started on the "hanger" at your home as per our phone conversation.<p>

Have someone qualified from the New York office take a look. If it shows promise proceed with an offer of no more than 1,000.  If they don't bite then insist on an analysis.  If it can pass that then you can go higher. Have it shipped to Jerome at the Academy of Sciences and see what he says.  Pay him the usual rate<br>

I'm in Corinna.  Tomorrow morning I will start looking for guides and a place to set up.  Mikhail will be here the day after tomorrow.  This place is incredibly wild and untamed!<p>

Jacqueline took a look at the "Fairy book" and thought that it was worth your interest.  The seller balked at your offer of 1000 and countered with a sum of 10,000.  For that amount I told Jacqueline to have it examined beforehand.  But the seller has refused to part with it for the length of time needed for a proper laboratory analysis and insists that any examination be done at her home.  This is possible but it will shut down that department for at least a week while they move equipment and manpower to Chicago.  At this point and time I thought you might want to rethink your offer or just call the whole thing off.  Maybe if we back off then the seller will come down from her high horse. It's seems to be becoming more trouble than it's worth.<p>

Mikhail should have his guides picked out by the end of the week.  I'll be leaving around then as soon as it looks like everything is in order.

Better News:  I spoke with Mikhail last night and he thinks he's on to something.  One of his guides came back with some spoor and a foot cast that match the 1930's descriptions.  Mikhail is going out with a bigger expedition in the next day or so.<p>

I've also heard nothing but good things about Marcus' replacement, Andrew.  Our person on the crew says that efforts are now ready to resume at a higher level than ever. They're eager to begin the real operation once again as soon as you give them the go ahead.  Can you believe they actually found some artifacts at the site of that wreck?

The book is now at your home.  Carmichael, our Mr. Fixit, finished early and brought the book to us on Monday.  Early dating tests place it at the late 1600's.  We've found mention of a "fairy bible" in several of your earlier manuscripts that may be a reference to this work.  A sample of the paper and ink has been taken to Jerome at the Academy for further study but I thought you would want to see the article now, even though it hasn't been completed legitimized.<br>

Now for the bad news:  The Devonshire map is a complete fraud.  Whoever did it, and I find it hard to believe that a 74 year old woman could have done this by herself, did a superb forgery job.  Jacqueline believes that they even went to the trouble of concocting ink based on an ancient recipe and that is what threw the lab initially.  The paper weave however has been ruled out as being from the correct time period.  J. now is certain that is a modern paper most likely from China or North Korea.<p>

I'm no longer in New York but instead flew into Knoxville on the redeye.  I'm renting a vehicle to take me to Franklin Tennessee after I check out a few facts here.<p>

I know it's down here somewhere.  I've already found evidence that it was not destroyed in the museum fire and was sold to a man named Keppler in 1904.  He displayed in at his home in Franklin Tennessee until at least the 1930's.  Unless it hopped across state and back into that Indian's grave I'm betting it's still floating around here somewhere. I have a few more leads and plenty of cash left so I'll let you know the moment something rears its head.<p>

Interesting that you have found yourself drawn to Tennessee. I uncovered a small bit of evidence while researching that the item did indeed survive the Medical School fire of 1866.  I did not tell you because I wanted to see if you could find corroborating evidence of the same.  This is however the first time that I have heard mention of Keppler.<p>

I am taking a short vacation from business and will be in Los Angeles for a short time.  I have heard that the rare book division of their downtown library has some new tomes and I am interested in seeing if any relate to our search.<p>

Keep me informed.  This one has been on my list for quite some time<br>
