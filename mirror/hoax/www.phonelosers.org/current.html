<p><hr width=10%><strong>September 2, 1999:</strong> General matenience throughout the site today.  Fixed a ton of dead links and fixed many of the broken ad banners.

<p><hr width=10%><strong>August 3, 1998:</strong> Did a bunch of work on the <a href=fonedirs.html">PLA Phone Directory</a>. Added a few more state sites, deleted a few others.

<p><hr width=10%><strong>July 2, 1998:</strong> Yesterday I got a new monitor and I noticed that phonelosers.org looks really stupid when you have a screen bigger than 640 x 480. This is fixed now but will still work with a smaller screen. NOW I just need to make it look good in Lynx and my life will be complete.

<p><hr width=10%><strong>June 26, 1998:</strong> Stopped logging the updates for awhile, hope nobody noticed. Today I completely redid the source code of the main page, shaving off about 20% of the html. Hopefully this will make things load a little faster. Also changed the layout around a bit and added a few minor things.

<p><hr width=10%><strong>March 17, 1998:</strong> What in the hell happened to our site? I've been getting a lot of e-mail about the new design and all I can say is to be patient. The web discussion boards will be back soon as well as the chat room and all the other crap you like. I will post updates here as they happen so keep your eyes peeled.

<p><hr width=10%><strong>January 22, 1998:</strong> The owner of phonelosers.org did a little moving around this week so the site has been down alot and we apologize for this. Today was the last phase of the transition and hopefully there will be no more down time than usual. All of the CGI scripts are screwed up today but I'll probably fix those sometime tomorrow morning. So don't try to post anything on the web board, it won't work!

<p><hr width=10%><strong>December 14th, 1997:</strong> Went through all the links on the <a href="plasites.htm">PLA Sites</a> page and weeded out the non-working ones and added about two more. Reorganized the <a href="pi.htm">PI page</a>.

<p><hr width=10%><strong>December 6th, 1997:</strong> Did some major renovations on the "<a href="insane.htm">Insane Links</a>" today. I was cleaning out my personal bookmarks from Netscape and decided to just dump it all in there so the links have nearly doubled. Check 'em out. Also, once again, the <a href="FruitWare/">web board</a> has been heavily modified and we've added about 5 new discussion groups. You can also <a href="fruitbbs.htm">download</a> a copy of the web board to use on your own page. Created an automated return links page that will list all of the URLs that people click on to access our main page. You can view this list by clicking <a href="return_links.htm">here</a>.

<p><hr width=10%><strong>November 14th, 1997:</strong> Finished up the new web discussion board. <a href="wwwboard/subs.htm">GO THERE.</a>

<p><hr width=10%><strong>November 8th, 1997:</strong> Major modifications to the web board. It's now alot easier to read and no so junky looking.

<p><hr width=10%><strong>November 1st, 1997:</strong> Added the cheesey clothesline imagemap on the main page. Fixed yet even more dead links. Added a "Crazy Phone Stories" in an attempt to clean up the "Weird Phone Stories" page. Managed to get the rotating banners to finally work so you'll notice they pop up on almost every page now. Annoying, eh?<p>

<hr width=10%><strong>October 25th, 1997:</strong> Finished up the sound clips page - removed all those useless tables, deleted the links to the old WAV files (which are no longer stored on phonelosers.org) and made sure that ALL of the sound links work now. Also, I added about four new <a href="sound.htm">sound clips</a> - two of them are from the new PLA tape so go take a listen now. Also fixed the problems with the <a href="photos.htm">video clips</a> so you can now download and play them if streaming is too slow for you. Converted the Nekidamy.AVI into a Real Video file. Finished the <a href="fonedirs.htm">1997 Fall Phone Director0y</a>.<p>

<hr width=10%><strong>October 20th, 1997:</strong> Fixed yet even more broken links around the site. Added the above KEEE.COM ad since it's my current favorite net radio station. Go check it out. Also, for all the latest new information concerning my personal life and the PLA in general, go read the <a href="http://www.bouldernews.com:80/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?Ramsey">Boulder News Forum posts</a>. Great source of current info.<p>

<hr width=10%><strong>October 18th, 1997:</strong> Again, the web discussion board and the guestbook are both working. A slight mistake on our part took out all the CGI scripts on the page. I've added alot of new links all over the pages and a free disk ordering script on the free disk page.<p>
