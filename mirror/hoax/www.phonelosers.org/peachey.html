There are currnetly five issues of Pink Fluffy Phreaking Bunnies (formerly known as Peachey Incorporated) which outline more or less what happened with a girl named peachey who happened into #rock one day. These are previously un-released files that only a few select people had been before. Enjoy!<p>

<ul>
<li><a href=zips/peach001.txt>Peachey Incorporated Issue #1</a> The introductory issue with a <a href=zips/peach.jpg>picture</a> of Peachey.
<li><a href=zips/peach002.txt>Peachey Incorporated Issue #2</a>
<li><a href=zips/peach003.txt>Peachey Incorporated Issue #3</a> The 3rd issue zip included <a href=zips/peachmap.jpg>The Peachey Atlas JPG</a>which included a map to peachey's house along with her picture and some scenic pictures from her little resort town.
<li><a href=zips/peach004.txt>Peachey Incorporated Issue #4</a>
<li><a href=zips/peach005.txt>Peachey Incorporated Issue #5</a>
<li><a href=zips/peach006.txt>Peachey Incorporated Issue #6</a> This one carries only one log of Peachey talking with bmbr. The rest is a big dump of all my e-mail folders and other stuff nobody cares about. Released on June 4, 1999.
<LI><a href=zips/peach007.txt>Pink Fluffy Phreaking Bunnies Issue #7</a> Logs, logs and more logs.  Some are peachey and some aren't.  There's also a list of every phone number going into the OCI building in Dallas, TX.

Since I've put these logs up, many people have asked me where is peachey today. Well, she's still on IRC. Shortly before we started leaving her alone, she began hanging out in #new2mirc2, #new2mirc and #mirc4fun. Her nick is currently peachangl but I've noticed since I've put these up that she's not online that often anymore. This leads me to believe that she's changed her nick because of people reading the logs, then finding her. I can't remember her ISP's name, but her identd says "peach" so if you /who *peach* then you may find her. Her name description was always "."  (a period)<p>
