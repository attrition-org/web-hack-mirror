<center><h2>STATE SITE WEBMASTERS:</h2></center><p>

First of all, I think I should thank everyone who's created a PLA state (or other country) page. Not only have you helped support PLA, but it's really helped bring a small portion of the h/p world together. I think if we can all work together, we can make this whole state idea a lot bigger. That's where this page comes in.<p>

Currently phonelosers.org is getting about 2,000 hits per day, but it doesn't seem that many of these hits are resulting in clicks on the state pages and it seems that no matter what I do, people just don't visit the States page all that much. We need to get together and brainstorm some ideas, think of ways to make the state sites better and get more clicks heading your way. I'd like to get at least half of those clicks going to the state sites instead. I've set up a discussion forum for state site webmasters so hopefully we can throw some ideas around. Go to the very bottom of this page to get some menu options for the discussion room, etc.<p>

You may have also noticed that I'm revamping the way the state sites are listed. I've put them in database format so they can sort sorted differently, searched, etc. Eventually I'll get a password system in there so you can make changes to your listings without asking me to do it. If you'd like to change anything on your current listing or add your e-mail address, send me some <a href="mailto:bueno@midwest.net">e-mail</a> and I'll get it changed immediately.<p>

<center><h2>PROMOTING YOUR STATE SITE:</h2></center>

We can only do so much on this end to promote your state site. The real work has to be done by you to promote your site around the area you live in. This will get the locals interested in you and soon they'll be watching your every move and eventually you'll be arrested. This is your first step to becoming a cool hacker guy, because everyone will think you're just like Kevin Mitnick!! These are some basic ideas we've either personally tried or have had suggested by other state sites. Many of these were contributed by MMX Killa. If you have any other ideas, let us know..<p>

<ul><LI>Public Access Computers: Internet computers are popping up all over the place now, especially in public libraries. Run into the library and demand to use the internet computers. Once seated, start modifying their bookmarks. Not only should you insert several of your own pages into the links, you should use your elite knowledge of Netscape and IE to modify the toolbar selections and make them point to your site.<p>

<LI>Now that that's done, create a bunch of new shortcuts all over the system pointing to your URL. (Make sure you include the .html on the end.) Give them all flashy interesting names to ensure people will stumble upon them and click them. After you're done with one library computer, go to the next one. Then find more libraries. Then head over to the cyber cafes and then do the same with computers at places like CompUSA, Babbages, etc. Those computers actually GO HOME with people.<p>

<LI>Go to every search engine imaginable and search for keywords that would describe your city. Find and bookmark just about every commercial & personal page that has anything to do with your city. The best are those touristy pages that offer fun things to do in town and usually contain pages of local links. E-mail the webmasters of every page you find and ask to please be added to their links page. E-mail the people who have regular homepages and tell them how much you enjoyed their page and ask to be added to the links section. Then keep pestering the hell out of them all until they get you added.<p>

<LI>Ask the local print shop to print up 1,000 bumper stickers with a catchy phrase and your URL on it. Then in the middle of the night, sneak over to the police station and completely cover all of their off-duty patrol cars with the stickers. Your URL will get plenty of attention then!<p>


<li>Whenever you go to a major public event, hand out flyers to random people standing around, or waiting on a line (like a ticket, concession, bathroom, or payphone line).<p>

<li>Put up flyers at payphones - the one place you'll ALWAYS find a phreak!<p>

<li>Find a place where there's a "Take one" box, such as a real estate listing.  Pull them all out and burn them, because they're of no use now, and replace them with flyers for your site!<p>

<li>Whenever you see someone about to use a payphone, slam down the switch hook, and say "It's okay, I'm from the PLA, I'll take care of this call for you."  Place their call (and <em>pay</em> for it), and say, "There you go sir/ma'am".  Then hand them a business card with your URL displayed on it.<p>

<li>Slip half-page flyers in all of the 2600s at a local bookstore. Slip half-page flyers under people's windsheilds. Slip half-page flyers through the cracks under every closed door that you find, anywhere. Slip half-page flyers into every mailbox on a given street. Slip half-page flyers into every passerby's pocket as you're walking. Slip half-page flyers into a napkin dispenser, so that anyone who wants a napkin pulls out a half page ad for your page.  Hehehe, think of the fun.<p>

<hr><center><h2>STOP THE COMPETITION!</h2></center>

This is getting rediculous - becoming a PLA State Site should not be done in competition with OTHER state sites. The idea is to meet locals, share information, network and learn new things together. There are several states out there that think they are in direct competition with the other state sites in their area code. It shouldn't be like this, you guys should be linking each other.<p>

This is just my thoughts on it, you can do whatever you want but personally I think it's really stupid to rip on each other constantly. Below is an e-mail I got from one state site owner who attempted to contact a fellow "local" who also ran a state site. From this you can probably understand what I'm talking about. Obviously I removed the names and state information to avoid further conflicts.<p>

Sup, this is [censored], I'm the creater of the new PLA[censored], I'm not currently affiliated with the other PLA[censored].  I'm sendin you all some e-mail, cause I want you to check out [my] page. I'd like you to link it from your site, just as I have yours. It'd be cool  to meet with you all on irc sometime too, just to talk.  It seems kind of ridiculous not to get to know the other pla's of [censored], we all represent the same state so, if it's alright, let me know when we can meet.<p>

You don't really want to know what i think...cause it won't make you happy. First of all i think of you guys as just another bunch of losers trying to follow in our footsteps.  The other Pla[censored] sucked ass, so i don't know how much better you guys can be.  You do know that you can never in your wildest dreams be as good as us.  Do you know how pathetic that PLA[censored] is...they take people they we wouldn't even take into our group.  Oh yea...so info on your page...make sure all your fucking links work before you put it up and tell people to go to it...cause it is annoying as all fucking hell getting the 404 error message.<p>

Also...when you send fucking 4 or 5 of the same e-mail to a person they tend to get a bit annoyed.  So i just want you to know....don't fuck with us.   The PLA[censored] is the only real PLA State site and this motherfucking state isn't big enough for all of us.  <p>
