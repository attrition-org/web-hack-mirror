<center><h2><em>Why Start Your Own PLA Page?</h2></em></center>
<strong><font color="ffff00">

People are always complaining that there is no H/P scene in their hometown and that they are the only ones who would ever be interested in learning about phone companies. But who knows, maybe some guy just a few blocks away from you is saying the exact same thing. By setting up a PLA page for your home town, you stand a better chance of meeting other people with similar interests and learning about the phone company together, rather than by yourself or not at all.<p>

The original intent of inviting others to create their own PLA pages was to learn about the H/P scene in other specific areas of the world. So far the results haven't been too bad and a few people have even managed to meet other H/Pers within a few miles of them by creating a page.<p>

<strong><font color="ffff00">

Easy, you just set up the page somewhere and <a href="state_add.html">send us the URL</a>. We will most likely link any PLA page as long as it's really a PLA page and not just a coolio H/P page that you've added the words PLA to.<p>

To make your page useful, you should include information that would benefit other aspiring phreaks such as pay phone numbers, toneloc scans, scanner frequencies, telco test lines, etc. You can host the page anywhere you want, even on geocities or tripod. <p>

<center><h2><em>Guidelines For Starting Your Own PLA Page:</h2></em></center>
<strong>

<font color="ffff00">
<ul>
<LI>The page MUST state that it's a PLA page and have detailed useful information about your city such as scanner frequencies, toneloc scans, pay phone numbers, telco test lines, fun stuff to do there, etc. Try to be original.

<LI>You may make links directly to this site, even everything on this site if you want, but you must also try to put some original content on the page. Local H/P happenings, organizations, local anarchy, anything. Just <em>try to be original.</em>

<LI>Before making your own PLA page, visit some of the other PLA pages first just to get an idea of what you can do.

<LI>The above guidelines are what I'd like to see in the PLA pages, but I'm not going to make any attempts to enforce them. You can do whatever you want with your site and it's unlikely that I'll refuse to link anyone's. Any other questions can be directed to <a href="mailto:bueno@midwest.net">me</a>.

<LI>There is now a section on the bottom of the sites page for ftp PLA storage. If you don't have the time to create your own original web page, just upload all the PLA graphics, issues and/or sound files and I'll link you.

<LI>To look at all the current PLA sites, click <a href="state_list.htm">here.</a>

This is an issue that I can never seem to get through to anyone so maybe writing this here will help clear some things up. PLA is not a group. By making a PLA State Page you are not joining a group. The "PLA Hackers Group" or whatever you want to call it does not exist! State sites are created for one purpose - to help you meet other people like you.<p>

I see alot of people attacking each other because one will say they're a part of the PLA group, etc. This doesn't bother me and I don't care what the state sites call themselves. Saying that you're the Phone Losers of Tahoe is fine with me and claiming that you're the Iowa PLA Phreaker's Union is great. Even writing your own independent issues of PLA-Pennsylvania is okay with us. Do whatever you want! Call yourselves whatever you want! We honestly do not care.<p>

We really appreciate all the people who've taken the time to put up PLA state pages and this little rant isn't intended as a flame towards any of you. The state pages have really helped our growth, helped us get noticed in the search engines, helped promote our stupid little projects and helped all the other state sites to promote their own projects & groups. Just remember that PLA was never any kind of organization, it's just an old magazine that isn't printed anymore. Dammit! :)<p>
