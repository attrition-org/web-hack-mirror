So many people own these really nice scanner set-ups with 20 foot antennas in their back yards and $700 worth of equipment and they seem to think all this is good for is listening to the police activity on the weekends. Hopefully this page will teach you otherwise and you'll become a total scanner junkie and just sit and scan all day. It's a nice life - I know. If you'd like to read letters from other people who have visited this page, click <a href="scannerletters.htm">here.</a><p>

Below is a listing of the basic 10 & 25 channel (non-900 MHz) phones. There is a frequency for both the base and the handset of the phone but you should only need to program in the base since that picks up both sides. If you program in the handset, usually you'll only hear one side of the conversation <em>but</em> sometimes when they're finished with their call, you can still hear what's going on inside their house. The sound quality of this sucks, though. Channels 1 through 25 are the 25 channel phone freqs (of course) and channels 16 through 25 are the 10 channel freqs. If you only have a ten channel scanner then program in the base sides of 16 through 25.<p>

<center><h2>THE LAW</h2></center>
As soon as I get around to doing a little research, I'll try to give you a vauge idea of what the regulations are concerning all types of scanning. For now, though, I'll just post my favorite law - "An individual may not have a scanner in their possesion while in the act of committing a crime." Yeah, like you're really going to pay attention to this law if you're busy breaking another one. If you have any comments or actually know something, please e-mail me.<p>


<center><h2>CAUSING MAJOR TROUBLE WITH YOUR SCANNER</h2></center>

<LI>After your neighbor's place a pizza order and the pizza parlor has already called back to verifiy the order, call the pizza parlor back and make major changes to their order. Add a few dozen cans of coke, twisty bread and lots of sub sandwhiches. Then listen to the confusion when the customer gets their order and calls the pizza parlor back to yell at them.

<LI>Listen to the taxicab dispatcher and when they read off an address they're going to, call all the other competing cabs in the area and send them to the same address. Taxi companies have a problem with other taxis listening in to their frequencies and picking up their customers before <em>they</em> can so when they all meet at this address, they'll each assume that's what the other did and if you're lucky, a fist fight will errupt.

<LI>If your scanner is handheld, plug some headphones into it and take it with
you on beige boxing expeditions.  If someone calls the cops, you will know about it
and can leave before they show up.  Of course, if a cop is just patrolling
and sees you clipping into a telco can, you are screwed anyway. (Submitted by Brian)<p>

<LI>This is my favorite form of CHEAP entertainment with my scanner. I have one of those cool Radio Shack amplified all weather speakers in my car and I go to the drive through at the fast food restaurant. When the person in front of me places his order, I turn it on and his order is blasted all over the parking lot.  The manager comes out to check what is wrong..It is LOTS of fun! Also, when I place my order i hold the speaker next to the Order microphone and it confuses the clerk taking the order!  They ask me to repeat it, etc. This usually gets the attention of the store manager and he comes and inspects the equipment. I also take my handheld scanner into the dining room and connect to the external speaker and get weird looks from the customers and manager. (submitted by Sorrenti - daves@csnet.net)<p>

<LI>I was listening to my scanner one day, and I started hearing this dial tone, so I whipped out the ole recorder. This guy was dialing his VMB number, and then the VMB asked for his name, so he dialed his name in (the name was probably numbers), and then it asked for his security code or something like that, and he dialed in about 5 digits, and then his VMB said he had no messages. Now, if this happens to you when scanning, you can record the tones and decode them to know what numbers they exactly are. Now that is a another way of "hacking" or getiing into someone's VMB machine. (submitted by American Anarchist)<p>

<center><h2>THIS IS COOL! WHERE DO I BUY A SCANNER?</h2></center>
Soon I'll have resources listed here to buy a cellular & 900 MHz capable scanners. You may think that cellular listening is the most important thing you'll need, but really any basic cheap scanner will pick up all the cordless phone frequencies and fast food drive-thrus. So don't spend a million dollars buying a scanner, just one that has an adequate amount of memory presets to store all your fun channels. I reccommend at least 50 channels, preferably more. Both Wal-Mart and Sears now have decent Uniden scanners you can buy for under $200. Also check out the links below:<p>
