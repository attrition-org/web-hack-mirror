I mean, click on "<a href="viewpla.html">I understand</a>" to willingly absolve y'all of any guilt by association, and you pull that cheap java script trick.... not nice.. even if it's bogus to rattle the paranoid.<p>

Irritated me sufficiently I couldn't ignore the busted links and wandered off before I could see if you were merely recycling old issues of Phrack.<p>

Hey, how's it goin? I was just at the "back issusues" part of your site, and I clicked the disclaimer agreement. "Oh, shit! He's got me name, phone number and password now! He's got to be fucking joking. Quick, quick, hit no! Oh, no. This sucks hard.  god damn. I gotta change my password, and quick. Oh, shit! my ISP's site is down. Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck. Whew, okay, calm down. Take your valium and call the ISP. God Damn! They're not open sundays! Jesus. Alright, call *Name Witheld*. He'll know whether it's real or not. Shit. his phones busy. I'm really screwed now." I think you get the idea. I eventually got through to *Name Witheld* and he calmed me down an told me it wasn't real. Now I feel like a dumbass. Oh well.<p>

Subject: What just happened here?!?!?!?<p>

Upon entering your "<a href="viewpla.html">View Pla Issues</a>" section something came up and said it
took my password, address, etc., after i aggreed not to hold pla responsible
for the material in the issues.
I have contributed to PLA's phone book in the past, under this name and "B
CLOS SUX."  Now, why am I getting bothered with this?  I am not a Hacker, or
computer genius as such- I am a Phone Loser.  My whole lifes objective is to
make peoples lives miserable over the phone and I'm just here to trade info
and stories on pranks, ok?<p>

Thanx,<br>

Subject: Whats up with that?<p>

Someone submitted my name and number to the loser list.
I have nothing against PLA, and the calls aren't that anoying, in fact
there quite fun to recive. I like to yell and swear and make the other
person feel like shit. If you could be so kind as to take my name off
the list. I have only had 3 ppl call me and thats not enough to keep me
in the list.<p>

Hello, <br>
I recently visited PLA, very insightful, not ! My friend who is a hacker
told me it ruled, that it was better than Cheese on toast, Bullshit, I
don't mean to be rude but I have had the internet for about 3 years now,
and I may have no life because I'm sucked in to the incessant well of my
PC, but your site just doesn't cut it. It lacked 3 or more major things,
a style, not a classy style necessarily, but not any style. It lacked
distinction and uniqueness, and it lacked direction, get a grip on
reality.  <p>

Yours Sincerely Carly Jones<p>

RDCP:<br>
My name is DiGiV3RsE. I've been a phreaking and known of the PLA for quite awhile. I live in Waco, yes it sux, yes we prank the people in the Branch Davidian, and charge all our long distance calls to them. I am writing the Phone Losers of America Phone book. It consists of phone # 's of buisnesses, Pay phones, & a Loser list. I want it too be hugh so the members of PLA will NEVER be bored. It will be published, and printed. I've already tooken the liberty of taking #'s out of your Bored Article. If you have any more that you wwould want to be in the Phone book let me know. They will be $8.50 a peice or 15 for $80. If you would like one write me and send check/money order to:<p>

DiGiVeRsE Technology<br>
7527 Rock Creek Rd.<br>
Waco, TX 76708<p>

P.S. Let everyone know about them please!<p>


<font color=ff0000>So you want to make money by using the PLA name, using numbers out of PLA issues and charge ME for it? And to top it off you'd like me to advertise for you so you can make lots of money? Okay! The check is in the mail!<p>

Just a few things, PLA isn't a group - it's an old e-zine that isn't published anymore. I store the back issues on my web site with other interesting things. There are no "members" as you call them. Also on the web site is PLA's Quarterly Phone Directory which is a phonebook released 2-4 times a year which offers all of the numbers for free so if you actually convince someone to pay for your list of phone numbers then you're one hell of a salesman. And thirdly, people usually don't take kindly to others stealing their hard work and trying to make money off of it so next time you do it, try doing it behind their back.</font><p>

First, you have alot of room to talk considering YOU are providing tapes for
$7 of you prank calling people. Making money off their INCONVIENENCE! WhoA!
Thats alot more noble than putting out a PUBLISHED BOOK.
Second, the publishing/printing cost are EXACTLY $8.50, I AM MAKING NO CASH!
ZERO! The only reason I offer the 10 for $80 deal is because I can come up
with the difference. I am trying to offer a pocket phonebook of #'s that
people often prank call/phreak/hack/etc.
I am just trying to help the scene considering it's dumbasses that live in
Corpus Christi that our ruining the scene, So I'll take out YOUR 'SHIT'. Sorry
for your inconvienence.<p>

                                      DiGiV3RsE<p>

<font color=ff0000>Oh, please don't cry, it'll be okay. Making a directory is fine with me and using all of the numbers out of the latest PLA directory is cool too, but next time ask before you use a copyrighted name in work that you plan to sell, whether you're making a profit or not. And who are these dumbasses in Corpus? Me & Colleen haven't lived anywhere near Texas for over three years now. Get with it, kid.</font><p>
