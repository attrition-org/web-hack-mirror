The Phone Losers of America currently offers two different types of lists. The first one is a discussion list in which you can participate in an ongoing conversation about phones, computers and just about anything else of interest. The other is an update list which sends you an e-mail every month or two with the latest news & updates with anything PLAish. Click the icon of your choice:<p>
