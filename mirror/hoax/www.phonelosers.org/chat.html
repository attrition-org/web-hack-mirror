<p>This chat room requires Java support. You can also join the chat without java using any IRC client, connecting to <a href="irc://irc.webmaster.com">irc.webmaster.com</a>, and joining the #wraithtech channel. If there is nobody in this room you might wanna to try a few other PLA-recommended chat rooms:<p>

<br><br>On any efnet server:
<li>#pla - An unofficial support channel for PLA.
<LI>#deaf - STB's old channel. They still ban you if they think you're "with" PLA.

<br><br>On any dalnet server:
<LI>#pla
<LI>#phonelosers
<LI>#teens4jesus - This is a great place to come and start making references to Jesus being a homosexual. A lot of times there's either no ops or all the ops are idling so you can last a long time here. Try using the nicks "Jesus" or "God" and you'll get auto-kicked.
<LI>#quiltchat - Join this channel and type "PLA" and you'll get kickbanned really fast. Apparently these people don't appreciate PLA's humor.<p>
