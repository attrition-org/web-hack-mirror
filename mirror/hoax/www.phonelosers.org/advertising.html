<strong>

Advertising on phonelosers.org will guarantee you better exposure on your web site. Our rates are much cheaper that you'll find on just about any web site and you'll get more exposure since we rotate our ads on about 80% of our pages instead of just the main page. <p>

<ul>
<LI> Commercial ads cost $20 per month.
<LI> Non-profit ads cost $10 per month.
<LI> Ad banners must have a size of 250 x 60.
<LI> On certain occasions (ie: we REALLY like your site) we will provide the advertising for free. This usually occurs when I find a site on my own, not when you e-mail me, begging for free advertising. So don't ask.
<LI> Normally we expect you to come up with your own banner and send it to us. However if we're in a good mood, we will make one for you.
<LI> If you have any other questions, email <a href="mailto:rbcp@phonelosers.org">rbcp@phoneloser.org</a>.
</ul>
