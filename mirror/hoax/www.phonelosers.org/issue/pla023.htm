<h1>Big Useless List of 10xxx Codes</h1>

I decided to prove to all of you once and for all that I really don't have a
life...So here it is...Starting on a weekend night when I COULD have been out
abusing illigal substances, I began to dial all of the 1,000 long distance
codes, one by one and here's a list of all the codes just to prove it.<p>

All of these codes work from Corpus Cristi, Texas but if you're reading this
from another state, you'll notice that some of the codes don't work and there's
some that aren't listed here. Sorry, but I just didn't have the time to take
airplanes around the U.S. and try out the codes everywhere.<p>

To use a long distance code, dial 10xxx-1-AREA CODE-NUMBER. To speak with an
operator, dial 10xxx-0. To identify what a certain code is, dial 10xxx-1-700-
555-4141 and it'll usually tell you what carrier owns it. That 700 number is
a free call, by the way. If you want to use your stolen calling card with one
of these codes, dial 10xxx-0-AREA CODE-NUMBER and follow the instructions.
Some of these people won't let you place a call unless you have an account on
their system.<p>

Most of these companies know exactly where you're calling from and what your
phone number is but a few can't tell so you can use them as extenders. My
favorite to play with is 109870. It's just like 1-800-COLLECT but it's a little
less advanced AND it's in Spanish. It really confuses whoever you call.<p>
