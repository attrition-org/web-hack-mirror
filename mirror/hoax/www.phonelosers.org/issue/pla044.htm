 HIM: So you got your pictures back or not?
 HER: Well, we got the proofs from Sears when we had them
      taken but I don't have the money to purchase them yet.
 HIM: Bummer.
 HER: I was thinking of just taking the proofs down to the
      copy shop and having color copies made & getting them
      blown up and stuff.
 HIM: Well, you can't do that because there's a copyright
      on the proofs and I doubt the copy shop would do that
      for you.
 HER: Oh, like they'd care. It's self-service so they won't
      even know.
 HIM: Heh.
 HER: I don't know if they'd come out very good if we enlarged
      them that way, though.   ...Hold on, I got another call...
 HIM: Alright.
 HER: <click> Hello?
  ME: Yes, this is Steve from the Copy Super Center downtown.
 HER: Yes?
  ME: Well, I'll be blunt with you. We know all about your
      dishonest ploy involving the copyright infringement of your
      photographs from Sears. This is just a friendly warning,
      but you'd better stay the hell out of our store and take
      your illegal activities elseware.
 HER: Who is this?
  ME: I told you, I'm Steve from the Copy Center here in town.
      We'll have the feds staking out the store front so don't
      even think about trying to make copies of your kids'
      photographs here. *click*
 HER: *click* Oh my god, are you there, Shane?
 HIM: Yeah, I'm here.
 HER: Shit, you're not gonna believe this...

<center><h3>Setting Up Your Own 900 Number For Fun and Profit</h3></center>

Everyone knows that you can make big bucks by purchasing a 900 number. You've
read the ads - "Stop making your boss rich, be your own boss! Make thousands
of dollars a week owning your own 900 number!" What these ads don't tell you
is that before you can get anyone to call your 900 number, you have to spend
an ungodly amount of cash advertising in the backs of magazines before you'll
ever make any money. So unless you can afford big bucks in the first place,
you're not going to make anything. Until now.<p>

<h4><em>Find A 900 Service:</em></h4>
One of the most difficult parts is actually finding a decent 900 provider.
You should look for one that requires very little or no deposit. Most of the
services work like this:<p>


1. You send the 900 provider a small fee (hopefully under $50) or with some,
    no fee at all. You also send them your name, address and other important
    information.<p>
2. The 900 service will provide you with either your own personal 900 number
    or they will give you a pin code to be used on THEIR 900 number.<p>
3. Each time someone calls your 900 number or uses your pin number, you will
    get a small amount of the profits. (Like maybe $1.00 a minute from their
    $2.99 a minute cost.)<p>
4. About a month or two later, you'll recieve a check from them for your
    portion of the profits.<p>

That's how most of them work that'd you'd want to deal with. Of course, you
could bypass a 900 provider altogether and just invest about $2000 and set up
your own, but I've never had that much extra money lying around to blow.<p>

To find a 900 provider, do a web search on "own your 900 number make big
money" or something similar. Also look in the backs of magazines, such as
Entrepreneur and Rolling Stone. They usually have the ones where you invest
about $100 to get your own pin number. One service I know of that doesn't
charge anything to start up is Web 900. Their phone number is 1-800-362-6728
and their URL is <a href="http://onlinew.com/logicom">
http://onlinew.com/logicom.</a> They let you set an amount to
be charged for each call. (ie, someone calls your 900 number and gets billed
$25.) There's also BBS 900 which does the same thing.<p>

<h4><em>Okay, I'm Ready to Start Accepting Calls:</em></h4>

You've got your 900 number set up and now you just need to get some people to
call it. Here are a few tricks that will make you the richest kid in your
neighborhood.<p>

 <LI> Call the 900 number with your own phone. Sure, the phone company will shut
   off your line and your credit will be ruined, but in two months you'll get
   a check big enough to pay at least 1/3 of it off. (Okay, that's not very
   realistic, but it WILL work.)
 <LI> Go to a neighbor's house every night and beige box into their lines to
   call your own 900 number. Or better yet, a large business that won't
   notice the 900 charges on their bill for awhile.
 <LI> Find a phone number that nobody ever calls, such as a gas station's
   credit card line. If you can't seem to find one in your area, then call
   the billing office and order a phone line for an empty house. Make sure
   you get call forwarding for this line. Then beige box into the line or
   use remote access call forwarding to forward all the calls to your 900
   number.<p>

   IMPORTANT NOTE: Some people think this is a great way to set up a 900
   line that you can call day and night and never be charged for the call.
   Sometimes this is true, but most times it isn't. When you dial the local
   number you've forwarded to a 900, sometimes the ANI passes through from
   your line to the forwarded number, to the 900 service. Sometimes this
   doesn't happen. It all depends on how the 900 company is set up. One of
   three things can happen when you call a local number forwarded to a 900
   line:<p>
           <pre>
        1. ANI will pass through and charge YOU for calling the
           900 number, whether you have a 900 block on your phone
           or not. (Having a block and getting charged for 900
           calls really confuses the phone company.)
        2. ANI will pass through and both you AND the place you've
           forwarded the call from will be charged for the call.
           This is really weird and you have to wonder who's
           collecting the money on that double billing.
        3. ANI will not go through and you won't get billed for
           the 900 call - the forwarded number will.
                </pre>                    <p>
   Unfortunately, the only way really to find out which of these happens is
   to try it out and watch your phone bill next month to see if the charges
   appear. To be really safe, don't call the forwarded number from your
   house. Ever. The same thing happens with some 800 numbers so don't think
   this is a risk-free diverter either.<p>

   One really interesting thing is that you can go to a Bell pay phone and
   call your forwarded number, be connected to the 900 number and the Bell
   pay phone will start getting charged for 900 calls if #1 or #2 happens.
   This will alert the phone company that something REALLY odd is going on
   and the phone company will usually (not having anywhere else to turn to)
   call the 900 service provider and ask them what the hell is going on.
   This raises suspicions to your 900 account, the 900 people call you and
   ask if you know what's going on. This is all un-wanted attention so if
   you're doing this to make money, don't use a Bell pay phone.
 <LI> Place an ad in your local newspaper and say whatever you have to to get
   people to call your local forwarded number. Try to aim the ad mostly at
   teenagers and kids so they'll call the number, think, "Hey, neat, a chat
   line!" and they'll tell their friends about it and so on. Example ad:
   "New FREE chatline available! Usually it would cost you $2.99 a minute
   but this month only, you can experience the fun for FREE through our
   local free number! Call 258-0357 and enter pin #2539 today!"
 <LI> Print up a bunch of flyers with your local number on it and post them
   everywhere. In your school, in your church, on community bulletin boards,
   throw them at police cars. Just whatever you do, don't let anyone see
   you doing this or you'll have an angry mob of townspeople at your door
   when the phone bills arrive.
 <LI> Log onto a BBS in your area and get an account under a false name. Make
   sure you use *67 when calling the BBS since alot of sysops use Caller ID.
   Spam all the message groups with ads of your local phone number.
 <LI> Set up a "local" 900 number in every area code across the United States.
   Then place ads in all the newspapers where you've set up the numbers.
 <LI> Tap into the lines of CoCots and try dialing the 900 number directly
   from those. Most of them have 900 blocks but there's always a few.
 <LI> Find a well-hidden green telco box, bring your phone and sit there and
   dial your 900 number all night.<p>

<h4><em>Payment:</em></h4>

After you've done all you can to generate traffic to your 900 line, sit back
and wait for the payments to start arriving. The few 900 services that I've
experimented with will wait two months before sending you a pay check. This is
to ensure that nobody disputes the 900 charges on their line and they pay you
for it and have to deduct the charges from your next check. <p>

Charge-backs will happen but there's always gonna be alot of people that just
don't notice the extra charges on their bill or they won't alert the 900
service in time. Some 900 services advertise "no chargebacks!" but those are
usually the ones that ask for about $99 to get hooked up so I've never messed
with them.<p>

Most 900 services will send a monthly paycheck to the address you claim to
live at. Since if you're good at this, this could be considered big-time fraud
so maybe you might wanna remain anonymous. Get a PO Box (see PLA043) and use
a voicemail as a contact number for the 900 company. Then again, if any
questions arise as to why so much fraud happens involving your 900 number,
you can just say you don't have a clue.<p>

<center><h3>STOP PAYING FOR 2600!</h3></center>

Awhile ago I tried to rock the boat in usenet's alt.2600 by posting a message
encouraging everyone to cancel their subscriptions to 2600 Magazine and
instead look at the issues on my web site where I'd pirated all of the back
issues. This web site, of course, does not exist. I only wanted to see a
discussion in alt.2600 that didn't have to do with getting the latest cracks
for the latest games.<p>

I expected a huge flame war to erupt, millions of posts, threatening e-mail,
calls to Emmanuel, feds to email me thank you notes. I wanted hackers to take
over hotmail.com where I'd set up my 2600 e-mail address, trace my connection,
hack my ISP, shut off my phones, destroy my life, maybe even get a free
Phrack t-shirt in the mail from Erikb for evening out the competition but all
I got in response were about 20 posts burried in the avalanche of "NEW WAREZ
MAILING LIST" posts. And most of the e-mail I got was positive, asking me when
the site would be up or people wanting to know the URL. <p>

When stating my depression of how little response I got, el_jefe suggested I
e-mail emmanuel and tell him he sucks and I want to be sued RIGHT NOW. But I
never got around to that. So anyway, here are all the posts from my thread and
all of the e-mail I got on hotmail. Maybe once people in alt.2600 read THIS,
they'll ruin my life so I won't be so bored. Coming next issue - the resulting
messages from my post in alt.christian, "STOP PAYING FOR THE HOLY BIBLE!!!"<p>

issue 2600 ever wrote since they began. I'm up to 1989 so the page
should be available very soon. Every detail to every issue will be
included such as pictures, covers and even hyperlinks to other cool
pages in each issue! Stop paying The Man and visit our page instead!
I'll post the URL in a few dayz...       <p>

Yo, i don't think my last message posted so i'll say it again. I'm
starting a new web page that has every issue of 2600 printed on it,
word for word including all the pictures as well as hyperlinks to
other cool sitez. Stop paying the rediculous subscription fees to The
Man and get them from my site for free. Ive compiled 1984-1989 so far
so my page should be up very soon. Any comments/suggestions can be
sent to me at pepman74@hotmail.com      <p>

I'm glad to see that you don't worry about pesky little details like
copyright law.  For some reason, netizens have become a little touchy
about that of late.  They seem to object to having their intellectual
property stolen.<p>

But you go right ahead.  You may just wind up paying 2600's
rediculous (SIC) legal fees.<p>

This will be an interesting situation. Does Emmanuel really believe in
freedom of information? If he does, he won't mind since this person is
taking a lot of time and energy to put them up. Hell, he may want copies
of everything for 2600.com ...               <p>

It's cool what your doing, but if everyone stopped paying them, then
they'll go out of business and then you won't be able to update your
web site.                                   <p>

         tried once again to spark a little interest, this time
         with a little (but not much) more success.]</h5></center>

I've gotten a lot of good e-mail and a lot of negative e-mail
concerning my new 2600 page. You lamers can shut the fuck up and do
something creative yourselves instead of telling me I'm stupid.<p>

For those who are worthy - my 2600 site is almost up. Im nearing
completetion and almost have all of the 2600 issues turned in to html
form and up on my page and I have also put the cover on the beginning
of each page and done a much better job than emmanuel's lame-ass scans
on his page. Until i am completely finished, i will not be able to
give out the address so be patent. I am almost finished!!!!<p>

Hmmm...I'm not sure I'd call them ridiculous.  (Or "rediculous", for that
matter.)  They're quite reasonable, considering the size, quality and
unusual nature of the publication.  <p>

It's great that you're doing this, but, everybody -- please -- don't let
this keep you from purchasing it.  If you don't buy _2600_, how do you
suppose it'll continue to support the hacking community?<p>

Information wants to be $1.99.<p>

I completely agree.....2600 provides a service that is very
helpful to cookbook collectors...they can't continue to produce
quality material and support meetings if they are being pirated

i'd just like to add something... i'm only 15, my parents will be a tad
suspicious when they see a computer/phone fraud magazine arriving every
month in the mail.  I'd gladly pay the fee, but me ordering the magazine
in hardcopy is not possible. I'd love to be able to somehow pay for the
electronic version, but that wouldn't be possible either.  Hey, phrack is
free, why can't 2600 be?<p>

<hr>

1) Goldstein has to live off of what he  gets from 2600<br>
2) Phrack is electronic, 2600 is published                 <p>

2600 is not about How to do fraud nor does it support it, It is for
all Knowledge Seekers with that burning desire to know how things work
not to know how to be a thief or to destroy things. Smoke that in your
pipe little Kid; being an idiot will not get you fame or respect have,
a desire to learn new things and then you will get the respect for
what knowledge you know and how you use it to express your talents.<p>

I think it's a good idea what you are doing and I am anxious to see your
page but I don't think it is a good idea for you to incourage others to
stop paying for the hard copy. If every one where to do so it would seise
to exist and soon make you new page just a bunch of outdated articles.<p>

If I recall previous issues of 2600... they consider copying to
be the best form of flattery... don't know what they currently
say, I don't have an issue handy.<p>

You can obviously get all the info in 2600 from the net, before
they put it into magazine form... but if your time is of any
value their summary is great... also... you can't read the web on
the can or the bus...<p>

Not to mention all the people 2600 reaches that isn't on the net
yet!<p>

I also notice in the original post, that the location of this
information was not given... leading to speculation that someone
is just trying to stir the pot!<p>

If you even try to put up the magazine online, you are going to have
serious problems on your hands. That isn't a threat. It's just a fact.
If you aren't willing to spend the $2-$4 four times a year for a damn
good zine then you have bigger problems. Don't be so fucking
disrespectful and pathetic. Show some support for the scene, not
adversity.<p>

Earlier this week, I recieved my monthly phone bill.  Of course, at the time
I was in West Virginia and my phone is in California so I now think that Bell
has men in trenchcoats shadowing me.  But inside the envelope, there was a
PacBell newsletter along with the ugly brown reply envelope that I used to
store my stolen "C&P W.Va" telephone pole plaque in. The newsletter was
evidently aimed at telling those people too stupid to read PLA issues how to
mess with people's phone service.  Oh, they didn't just come out and say it of
course,  but they hinted at it. I'll type up the entire thing below since I
have _no_ life.<p>

By the way, I just found out that this will not work if you don't live in Pac
Bell's territory.  I know that sounds obvious but I mean you can't find use
the 800 number from out of Pac Bell territory. I tried calling Bell Atlantic
and seeing if they had a similar service and they said no. I don't know about
any other RBOCs. Also, RBCP said it didn't work in USWest and they didn't have
one. Anyway, here's the little promotional thing, word for word:<p>


Ordering Services The Easy Way<p>
        If you're in a hurry and you want  to check your phone bill  balance
or order a Custom Calling service -- like Call Waiting -- it's easy to do so.
Just call QuickService(sm)  at 1-800-241-3000 (toll free),  With a touch tone
phone, our automated ordering system allows residential and small business

        QuickService allows you to order or change a variety of phone

You'll be asked to enter your area code and phone number and a security pass-
word to protect your privacy.  Your password can be your Pacific Bell Calling
Card PIN, your Pay-By-Phone PIN, or the last three numbers of your account
code, shown at the top of your Pacific Bell bill. If you call QuickService
during business hours, and afterward decide you want to speak to a represent-
ative,  you can press "00" and your call will be transferred to the next
available attendant.      <p>


<center>---[end of promotional advertisement]---</center>

Obviously, to use this service to your own ends, you will need someone's PIN
or account code. The easiest way is to call them up and do something like
this:<p>

<pre>
(GB = Greg Burri, 408-439-0206 / ME = pneyz)
  GB: Hello?
  ME: Hi. This is Chris Tomikson with the Bell Atlantic
      Phone Fraud Department, are you Brian Pedersen?
  GB: Yes.
  ME: We have detected some strange activity coming from
      your calling card.
  GB: I haven't used mine in a long time.
  ME: Then you weren't the one who made 3 calls to a waste
      management facility in Espoo, Finland?
  GB: What?! No. I know nothing about those.
  ME: I see. And did you use it to call the San Quentin
      Federal Penitentairy on the 4th, for 3.2 hours?
  GB: Never.
  ME: OK, we've been having a lot of problems like this.
      Have you locked your Telephone Network Interface box?
  GB: My what?
  ME: Never mind. Listen, we can have all those charges
      removed from your bill.
  GB: Thank you. Thank you very much.
  ME: I just need some way to make sure it's really you *little
      laugh to make them think it's just routine*.
  GB: Sure, what do you need?
  ME: Uh, how about the last 3 digits of your account number?
  GB: Umn, I don't know it.
  ME: Do you have a phone bill?
  GB: Yea.
  ME: OK, look up at the top. There's a number. Read the last
      3 digits.
  GB: Sure, they're 613.
  ME: Thank you. If there are any more charges on there that
      aren't yours, call the business office and tell them.
      Have a nice day and thank you for using Pacific Bell.

      </pre>

It's always best to wait until late in the conversation before asking for the
code.  This is because they will be more suspicious of you when you first
call. Also, I threw in the bit about the TNI to get them off guard. Technical
jargon and acronyms are always good to toss around to get them confused and
make them think only a TelCo employee would know them. Some good ones to use
are Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC), ACTS (Automated Coin Toll System),
TNI (Telephone Network Interface) and some Cellular terms like ESN.<p>

Sometimes though, the people will totally believe you and start asking how
they can keep this from happening and what might have caused it.  I normally
just trot out the old things like "cordless phone interception" (the guy
decided to throw away his cordless phone, heh) and "un-locked TNI box".  You
can also tell them that some hacker named Roy is doing this all over town.<p>

I tried calling there and ordering 3-Way Calling and for some reason, it gave
me an operator and when I added 3-Way, there _was_ a $5 installation fee. This
means that if you hit "0" to get an operator, you can make it so the person
you're harassing will get billed for the installation (normally, QuickService
doesn't charge for installation). Of course, I then cancelled it and re-
ordered it on QS.<p>

Since this is an 800 number, they can and will trace you. So if you're
screwing someone over, you might want to think about using a local payphone.
You can also use a payphone, order stuff to your line, and then complain that
someone else did it. It works.<p>

If anyone has any information about other RBOC's offering stuff like this,
send me email at pneyz@armory.com. Oh yeah, RBCP said that Ameritech (I think)
had a service like this that you could call in and enter a number and get
their phone bill but he implied that it has been discontinued.<p>

<center><h3>Making People Accept Collect Calls</h3></center>
<center><h4>by Jolly Spamhead & Ghost~Face~Killer</h4></center>

Hey, ever wanna harass a person long distance and don't want to pay for it?
Well, collect call them... What, they won't accept your call? Oh well, they're
gonna have to from now on with this new 313370 trick. <p>

Requirements to do this- First you need Three Way, because you need a friend
on the other line to do this trick and have it work right. With both of you
on the fone, one of you must click over and dial OCI (1-800-288-2880) as men-
tioned in previous PLA philez, Then click back over so you, your friend, and
OCI are all on the same line. Your friend just stays quiet for now. Give them
the run around like so...<p>

<pre>
   OCI Oci, This is Monica how may I help you?
 G~F~K Hi, i'd like to make a person to person collect call.
Monica Yes, can I have the number on the phone your dialing
         from?
 G~F~K Uh...yeah 206-265-7932
Monica Ok, can I have the number your dialing to?
 G~F~K Sure it's 860-568-1814 (or the # of the person your
         harassing)
Monica Whats your name sir?
 G~F~K My name is Fisher Priceman.
Monica Ok, whats the name of the person your trying to reach?
 G~F~K Uh Justin Daigle. (or any random name)
Monica Ok please hold and thank you for using OCI
</pre>

As soon as the lamuh picks up have your friend pop in and say I accept the
call. Like so...<p>

 <pre>
 *CLICK*
Justin He...
  Spam Hello?     <-- (Your Friend)
Monica Hello this is the OCI operator I Ha...
  Spam Yeah yeah, Whatever I accept.
Monica Thank you for using OCI. (Click)
Justin -Confused- Uh Hello?
</pre>

And there you have it, The Lamuh does'nt have time to Know whats going until
the operator is already gone and the call is already put through. Then it's up
to you what happens next, Have Phun. Hope you enjoy this, me and dave got this
to work 100% so far!<p>

Dazen Goes A Little Fruity in the Head:<p>

Dazen is one of the lamer people that hangs out 24 hours a day in #rock. Don't
believe me? Stop reading for a second, log on to IRC and look. He's on, isn't
he? He's always on. Well, one day he left for a second so I took over his nick
and ended up talking to a couple of girls he was trying to netsex. I began
raving in #rock that rbcp had shut off my phone and sent the cops to our
house. (Which, of course, is made up.) Here are the results:<p>

<pre>
(Bella_) Thank you Hank.. I appreciate you not yelling at me :)
(dazen) np
(Bella_) yes :)
(dazen) you're nuts
(dazen) can i do you?
(Bella_) So, did you get in trouble with the police there?
(dazen) yeah, they searched our whole house for drugs
        because of rbcp
(Bella_) I am?
(dazen) you are what?
(Bella_) Or did you type that in the wrong window? :P
(dazen) could be
(dazen) i'm all confused
(Bella_) uh... no
(Bella_) But I have a sister you could do *snicker*  j/k hhe
(Bella_) What did he do that made them do that????
(Bella_) hmm... either one of us is lagged.. or you're REALLY
         messed up tonight :) hehe
(Bella_) Then again, just the fact that you even asked if
         you could do me tells me you're pretty messed up :P
(dazen) well, i'm pissed and my mind isn't working right i
        don't think
(Bella_) Maybe you should go and sleep some of it off? :)
(dazen) no, because if my defenses are down, he'll do
        something else and i don't wanna be woke up by the
        police again.
(dazen) having a gun to your head really fucks you up
(Bella_) Why did he do it????  I just can't understand why
         someone would do something like that :/
(dazen) i don't know, cause i kicked his girlie one time
        when she came in the channel
(Bella_) oh.. hrm... it's hard to keep friends when chicks
         come into the picture :/
(dazen) hehe yeah no kidding
(dazen) she's a stupid cunt anyways
(dazen) he switched my long distance carrier too, i found out
(dazen) proably because that's the only thing he knows how to do
(Bella_) My husband had to kind of let go of one of his
         friends cause he kept calling me a *hole* hehehehe
(Bella_) oh gawd.. he's causing lots of trouble, huh?? :(
(dazen) yeah
(dazen) can i call you a hole?
(Bella_) uh.. no
(Bella_) Well, after one visit there, perhaps the police will know
         he's just being buckety and not come out anymore??? :)
(dazen) i hope not
(dazen) i'm feeling better now, thanks
(Bella_) Most police will know he's just trying to cause trouble
         and if he keeps calling them, they'll find out who he is
         and he'll be in trouble :)
(dazen) yeah, they kept asking me all these questions about
        PLA and stuff
(Bella_) hmm.. well, police can't do anything about the PLA
         anyway... so don't worry about it :)
(dazen) fuck off
(Bella_) who me?
(Bella_) What the hell are you talking about???
(dazen) i know what you just did
(Bella_) uhm.... I don't know what you're talking about.. mind
         telling me?
(dazen) yes i do
(Bella_) Hank... WHAT are you talking about??? I haven't
         done anything but sit here and talk to you :/
(Bella_) Yes you do what?
(Bella_) You're not making any sense tonight Hank :(
(dazen) forget it. i just hope you're happy now
(dazen) i'm going to go end my problems right now
</pre>

<center><h5>[After that, I logged off of IRC as Dazen,
then back in as myself. Here's what was said in #rock.]</h5></center>

<pre>
(Bella_) apok.. if you're here..... PLEASE msg me??????????????
(Apok0lyps) belles: what?
(Bella_) Are you at home with z3ns??
(Apok0lyps) yeah
(Bella_) Is he ok?
(JuNiE) z3n, okay? hmm
(Bella_) Junie.. I'm worried about him.. :(
(rbcp) what's wrong with dazen?
(vel0city) who are we worried about?
(jammie) dazen
(vel0city) why
(Bella_) I'm serious
(Bella_) apok.. could you PLEASE go and check on him??? please????
(Apok0lyps) belles: he's fine
(JuNiE) whats with dazen?
(Bella_) Why is he freaking out on me like that then????
(Apok0lyps) belles: I do't know
(Bella_) Can you tell me what he's doing right now apok?? Cause he
         said something really spooky to me before he left :(
(Apok0lyps) belles: sleeping
(Bella_) *whew*... good
(Bella_) He scared me half to death there apok... :/
(rbcp) how did he scare you?
(rbcp) i hope dazen gets hit by a bus
</pre>

<center><h5>[Then, the next day I was minding my own business (as Dazen, of
         course) and Bella_/Belles starts msging me again.]</h5></center>

<pre>
(Belles) Ok, wanna tell me what you were talking about
         that I allegedly did last night???
(dazen) You know!
(Belles) Hank.. I have NO idea what you were talking about
         last night :/
(dazen) Guess then
(Belles) I wouldn't know where to begin... other than
         returning a kick that you gave me :)
(dazen) Fuck off then
(Belles) All I know is that you kicked me and called me
         a bitch because you were too lagged to see me say
         hello.. and it went downhill from there *sigh*
(Belles) Oh, ok.. I see how it is.. I send you something...
         you get pissed off for no reason and that's the end
         of it, right??
(Belles) Ok, I'll leave... hope you have a good life Hank.. bye..
(dazen) Whatever bitch
(Belles) look Hank, don't even bother messaging me back, ok?
         If you want to get all upset about something and not even
         tell me what you're upset about, then I can't be held
         responsible for it... ok??  Let's just leave it at that
         unless you'd like to tell me what you're so upset about,
         because I honestly have NO idea :/
(dazen) Just FUCK OFF already
</pre>

<center><h5>[Later that day, Dazen left IRC again so Colleen took over his
         nick and a girl named skinflowr starting msging her. Part of
         the log was lost, but here's what we recovered.]</h5></center>

<pre>
(skinflowr) =)
(dazen) Fuck you bitch
(skinflowr) z3ns?
(skinflowr) please talk to me.
(skinflowr) z3ns i know you are not away
(skinflowr) i will not go away. i want to talk to you.
(skinflowr) you're probly posting everything i write.
            i don't care.
(skinflowr) i don't know what you heard but i wish you would
            talk to me. you must hate me. i'm so fucking stupid.
            i don't know what to say...well i do, but you ..will

hey, don't really know you, but i read pla and i know dhate was into the pla,
so i thought this might be a way to find him.  see, about, hell, about a year
or less ago dhate was on his way to my house in seattle, washington, before
he was to meet up with you guys in illinois or whereever.  anyways, he made
it as far as his mother's house after he stole his grandma's car and after
him and zak called up and harass my mother (i never thanked them for that) i
lost contact with dhate.  if you know anything, drop me a note, as it's kinda

A very simple way to get a new 300mhz, 21" monitor, 128mg of ram is to go to
best buy with a friend, carry all the goods around, go to pay for your $5000
new computer, before paying have friend sound fire alarm (by opening up one
of those doors), you run out screeming fire (with computer on hand) into your
car and drive of.<p>

Thanks for the file on taking over fred myers intercom system. I used to live
in the seattle area and fred myer is like a big thing there, and this trick
also works on Home Depot intercom systems. As you know home depot is the
largest chain of hardware stores in america now. It is kind of funny to stand
in line to pay for lumber and someone says over a loud speaker, "price check
on the variety pack of black and decker tampons--industrial strength." <p>

The A,B,C,D and E channels are also used for baby monitors which can sometimes
let you listen in on a whole section of the house if the parents are stupid
enough to leave it turned on all day.<p>

The 900 MHz Cordless Phones are getting more common as they become cheaper
and you can hear them from further away, but they periodically switch channels
in the middle of conversations and it's hard to find the same conversation
again once it's switched. If your scanner has 900 MHz capability, try scanning
in the 902.000 - 928.000 range.]</h5></center>

                                <hr>

I've got a story for you.  Within walking distance from my house (about
half a mile) is an IL Bell (now known as Ameritech) shit whats it called
(now this story is real credible eh?) well a repair station, where they
park all of their trucks.<p>

After months of driving by it drooling, a friend of mine decided it was
time to scale the fence and see what was inside the huge dumpster, and
try to see if some of the trucks were unlocked.<p>

The dumpster was bogus.  It was filled to the TOP of it with broken
asphalt, roofing, all sorts of weird shit we didn't expect to see.  So
we quickly moved over to the storage shed, which was locked.  So we
didn't get in.  There wasn't any windows and it was one of those "Grampa
Ed built it himself with no hands" type of shed that was made of rusty
sheet metal that made horrendous noise whenever touched.  So we left it
alone.  Right by it, but too large to steal (or get into our car
actually) was a phone booth laying on its side, with no phone.  It
woulda been cool to have.<p>

Since the parking lot was huge, we decided to split up.  It was about
2am on a Sunday night.  The parking lot was lit, but not brightly.
So all the trucks but two were locked, of what I found, and I got the
hard hat, a really cool rechargable drill, tools galore, some lady's ID
badge with magnetic tape on the back that we were too chicken to try to
get into the building with (talk about jail time eh?  That's like
admitting we broke into the trucks), grey phone boxes like on the back
of someones house (lots of 'em in one of the trucks), a conviently
placed cardboard box to throw a lot of this stuff in, a big leather belt
loaded with tools, one of those cool screwdriver type things that Elwood
uses in the Blues Brothers to rip open the panel in the elevator, those
big phone wiring panels for PBX's, a voltage tester, two testsets (one
cool and brand new, one old and beat up), a cool adaptor that I should
duplicate, it was to convert aligator clip testsets to an RJ11 plug.
WAy cool and way useful.<p>

My friend found an IL BELL jumpsuit that reeked of gasoline.  That was
his score, and after he stuffed that into his car, I started handing
armfulls of this stuff for him to return to the car, and eventually just
started chucking the non-shock sensitive equipment over the fence.<p>

We left.  We thought about dropping the stuff off at one of our houses
since if we ever got pulled over with all of this, that wouldn't be
cool, but we went for donuts instead (no, no cops) and I convinced him
to go back for more.<p>

He kept the car running and I went to the Great Big IL Van in the
parking lot.  It had tinted windows, and locked doors.  I wanted to get
in.  I kicked the back door (the trunk I suppose) and it opened.  Wow,
so I climb in and theres a LAPTOP and CELLULAR MODEM and A DESK WITH
LOTS OF COOL PAPERWORK AND ETC.  Were I a complete geek I would have
been orgasmic, but instead i just had a stiffy.  So I am gathering all
of this and making my way to the exit when... about three IL BELL trucks
started to pull up.  <p>

And my friends car wasn't anywhere to be seen.<p>

I had NOWHERE to hide.  I could have hid behind various bell trucks but
you could see under them due to the lighting that was periodically
placed around.  I saw two of those green "power" boxes that you see in
yards on occasion and tore towards them (with the laptop).  They offered
about 50% cover depending on what direction anyone could be coming, but
I was always exposed in some manner.  If anyone came down the major
street (that the trucks always do) or came into the lot along the side
street that was connected to the major street to get in and park, I
would have to expose myself to the other respective street.  So I did a
lot of moving.  <p>

The guys stayed a long time and did lots of talking.  I didnt have a 2
way radio at the time and if I did I wouldnt have used it, as I would
have undoubtedly been heard.  (this made for a good adrenaline high for
the duration of this adventure).  Eventually i just had to make a break
for it and slid the laptop near the fence by some bushes and scaled the
thing and booked off.  <p>

I eventually found my friend circling the area, and neither of us could
believe that these guys were out at 3:30am on a sunday.  around 5am we
went back and I retrieved the laptop. <p>

THere was a lot of interesting stuff on it, but the cellular modem was
lost in the escape and I was no way in hell going to dial any of those
numbers from my phone.  That same friend stole a worldport 9600 bps
modem from where he worked at the time, and that didn't work because
there wasn't enough voltage coming from the laptop. or something.  thats
what we deduced from the worldport manual... We had planned to call the
numbers from the back of a laundromat we had staked out a few weeks
before and determined to be safe for call making activity.  So that
didnt happen, and there was no power outlets anywhere to be found in the
back of the laundromat, so I couldnt just bring an external modem and
plug in.  So I never called any of these numbers, and I eventually sold
the lap top to some guy that never paid me in full and moved to a far
away state so I could harass him.  Im over it now, but im sure all the
data on the laptop was erased so he could install windows or something.<p>


I haven't done anything "cool" with phones/bell crap in a few years, but
that adventure had be burned out for a while.  I'd done some diving
since but nothing good ever turned up.  <p>

And I've NEVER seen any locks on garbage of bell places, just on the
garbage of computer places (which are also good places to trash at).<p>

<center><h5>[A few of the Bell buildings I've trashed at have their
         dumpsters locked by wrapping a chain around the top, over
         the lids. What they don't seem to realize is that plastic
         is flexible and you just have to step on top of the dumpster's
         lid to get inside. Cool story!]</h5></center>

Perhaps you already know, but about a week ago I read in a Swedish newspaper
about "Demon Phreaker" beeing busted for playing in 407 area in USA. I can't
find that article but it said something like: <p>

XX year old guy from Gothenburg, Sweden (I think it was Gothenburg, and i
dont rememer his age) was busted today, 9701 something for via a "telecom
switch" call for free to the 407 area in USA and connect various 911 lines
to each other and so. Also, they mentioned that he calls himself "Demon
Phreaker" and also said that he had acted cocky when he was in court. I
like that part with beeing cocky. :-) I will try to find that article and
translate it into english, it was a quite SMALL article so.. Hopefully I
can find it!<p>

Anyways, the PLA sure is fun reading, please keep the good work up, when
I get my FTP site up and running, PLA will for sure have a dir there.<p>

         Demon Phreaker from my Defcon Voice Bridge days. He's the one

When you get a PO box at Mail Boxes Etc. (PLA043) do they actually keep the
I.D. you give them? Do they write down all the info on the I.D.? Or do they
want it to see how old you are or just make sure you exist?<p>

<center><h5>[They definately won't keep the ID. It's possible they might
         want to photocopy it since most post offices have a copy machine
         around, although that's never happened to me. Most places just
         want to write down the information on your ID such as your
         birthdate and address and sometimes, the DL number.]</h5></center>

Another thing I remember you having a file on getting free disks through
AOL and you said to order them one by one to save you some trouble tell them
that your with a small computer business and you need to order around 250
disks. To make it seem more realistic order 75 Macintosh kits 75 DOS kits and
100 Windows kits. <p>

I have a number of some really idiotic people that I'd like to submit for the
numbers file.. 607-785-8736. These people live in a trailer park... maybe that
says enough about them haha..  My friends and I can kill hours bothering these
morons. I first started fucking with them when they submitted a complaint to
the resturant where I worked at the time that went something like this: "we
ate our dinner, then came home, we had diareeha (sp?) for two weeks then we
took a laxative, before we went there we did not have no diareeha!"  Hahha..
We're allways telling them we're gonna tow their fucking house away with a
Dodge Ram Pickup while they're sleeping hahaha..<p>

A year or two ago, I got a hold of a large, yellow, handset with a thumb
joystick, 6 or 8 line screen, and built in 1200 bps modem.  I hadn't the
slightest idea what it was for, I imagined COSMOS or something like that.
After perusing the local BBS's, they suggested a number to call with it,
and believe it or not, the battery went dead just as it was connecting.
So I let it charge for a day or so (it didn't take the typical 9 volt the
red handsets would take.  After all, it wasnt a typical handset)<p>

When I called the number back, I got a lady that said "Bueno!" and then
I hung up.  I called back again and got the same thing.<p>

I tried calling various BBS's with it, just to see what it would do, but
the screen wouldn't give me anything.  <p>

When not connected anywhere, there was a menu with a series of items,
like test line, call mainframe, and call various numbers that you had
stored.  there were no numbers stored in this unit at all.  Adding them
was easily enough done, you would hold the keypad number for so many
seconds as there was a letter (so B would be holding down the 2 button
for 2 seconds) and then at the end you'd be prompted for the name and
address.  It was somewhat similar to a Sharp Wizard organizer when it
came to storing numbers, although very much limited.  <p>

There was a switch on the right hand side that had three selections:
Phone, monitor (phone with mute, I assume.  Thats how it acted anyway),
and Modem. I determined the speed of the modem by calling my own modem
with it. Have you seen/heard anything like this?  If not, I'll see about
scanning a picture of it and sending it to you.<p>

I was looking through PLA 039 and I saw something about a telco guy plugging
a laptop into a pay phone at subway, I believe it was an Itronix T5000 EFP.
I was able to "borrow" one of those from a GTE guy who was working
by my house.  <p>

i saw in one of your more recent issues your article on getting a new id.
i liked it, however it wasn't immesnly practical for the person in serious
need of a permanant id.  the ones you create through your method are not
quite stable until you get a large amount of id's and cards to substantiate
your id.  <that is if you are using someone else's name>  one of our <tacd>
members happens to be very knowledgable in the area and i thought you may
be interested in his article.  zyd's good, we know is name, the name he
currently uses, however not even we know the name he was born with.  check
out www.tacd.com, there is a link off the main page to zyd's paper tripping
article.  he gives some good info and additionally gives a few refernces.
just thought you may be interested.<p>

         up some ideas I'd never thought of. However, my methods of
         creating IDs are more stable than you think. I lived under a
         false name, held two jobs, got a check cashing card and apartment
         in Indianapolis all from a photocopy of a fake driver's license
         and social security card and stayed there for over eight months.
         Then I did the same in Celina, Ohio for three months, then Oregon
         for almost a year. So as long as you don't wanna drive anywhere
         (I personally hate cars), it's good ID to have.]</h5></center>

First I just want to say that you have to be one of my favorite zine
writers. You are hillarious :).  Second, in your article about beige
boxing in Celina, you mention a specially cut allen wrench to open
payphones.  I was wondering if you have any text, pictures or anything
on how you can make one.<p>

Thanks a lot,<br>
ninja1@mitec.net <p>

<center><h5>[The allen wrench is just a normal looking allen wrench that has
         a deep groove cut into each end (making it appear as if it were
         hollow) so that it will fit the "screws" holding together most
         pay phone stands. To see what I'm talking about, look at the
         bottom panel of just about any pay phone. I've yet to find any
         of these wrenches in any hardware store.]</h5></center>

I was sexually asualted by a man with a hard hat, and a lineman handset. The
public has a right to know about this. I was innocently riding my bike down
the street...while wearing a PLA shirt, and throwing flyers advertising PLA,
when a big gray truck pulled up alongside of me. A man with a orange hard hat
with a bell etched in it, and a orange fone with clips on it and lots of
buttons walked towards me and asked me who i was.<p>

<pre>
 me: hello there sir
guy: hello sonny. i see yer with that group PLA huh?
 me: oh yeah! wanna see my official membership card?
guy: no i wanna see yer undie pants!
 me: oh no!my underwear? why you want to see them
guy: this is a strip search..i am searching for long
     objects (i strip down to my undies)
     (bell guy feels me)
 me: why are you feeling my weiner?
guy: its a routine test son
 me: get the hell out of here you flaming faggot!
guy: hey..it gets kinda boring with 1,000,000 pranks
     a day ya know!
 me: PLA will get you for this! (he jumps on me and
     trys to anally rape me)
</pre>

This is when i hit the fag with a baseball bat 20 times. His ears are bleeding
and he is dying, i spit in his face and walk away. This is how i beat up a
bell guy trying to rape me!<p>

hey i got a question i've been redboxing for about a year now, and the
only patfones i can box off of are the ones in my high school, they look
just like regular nynex payfones but the operator always comes on and
tells me that she isn't showing that i put in any quarters in the fone
but she never accuses me of using a redbox or anything.<p>

Bill<p>

<center><h5>[Some phones are just impossible to red box from. I had similar
         problems in Indianapolis where only about 50% of the phones in
         the city would work. I tried everything, but the other Bell
         phones just wouldn't work, unless I bypassed the pay phone
         altogether. In most cases it's because the mouthpiece is
         muted and it can't hear your red box until money is deposited
         and the call has connected. If you want to put in your first
         $3.00 of real money, you can usually use red box tones after
         that.]</h5></center>

After reading PLA 43, I've been inspired to start a lovely collection of
other peoples' birth certificates.  I'm using the chronicled newspapers at
the state library on microfiche to find out middle names and mothers
maiden names in the births column, so my lovely boss Dave-o the
De-vo(lved.) is first on my list (cos he's 18, and he can buy cool stuff.
And I could get him into trouble.), followed closely by Jimmy Jammy Jokey
Jerky Jamey (he's just a dickhead.) .  He's getting a lovely dead rose from
us for Valentines day.  Aren't we nice.  <p>

Regarding the liscence plate idea with 7-11 clerks, you might find it
effective to, instead of SPENDING MONEY to get a fake plate made, to instead
acquire the clerk's plates (or even the manager's).  Your swiss army knife is
your friend.  On top of it all, the loser has to get another set of plates.<p>

I was wondering how easy it is to get caught using faxback numbers? I've
been using the two hour long one for about two weeks. I always call from a
pay phone, a couple of times a day. But I have heard that the person I am
using it on has called the police, and the phone company. I have been in
trouble with the law for phone harrassment, and I don't want it to happen
again. Any feedback you can give me would be greatly appreciated.<p>

Oh, and by the way, if you know any PLA members who would like to help me
harrass someone, his name is Gary Stone,(everyone calls him stoney)
Lafayette IN, 47905, phone# 317-474-5423. <p>

Demon<p>

<center><h5>[Being in your situation, I wouldn't take any risks. Use a pay
         phone. All of the fax-backs I've listed use an 800 number which
         means that the company you're using does have your number,
         along with everyone else who's called them.<p>

         First, the person you're harassing would have to figure out
         that it's a fax-machine calling them day and night. Then they'd
         have to figure out what company it was, which wouldn't be that
         hard since the company name and number will show up on a caller
         ID box. THEN they have to figure out the company's voice number
         and arrange for them to check and see what number is dialing
         in to send them faxes.<p>

         I've tried this myself with several companies, pretending to be
         a victim of fax-harassment and didn't get anywhere with them.
         Of course, I didn't try to get the phone company or police to
         help me. So the risk is there, but it's rather slim, especially
         if your target is retarded. The only way to be 100% safe is to
         use a pay phone.]</h5></center>
