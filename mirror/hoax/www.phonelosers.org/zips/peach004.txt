Once again, nothing but an issue of logs. The #rock goons have calmed down a
little bit on peachey mainly because she suposedly has an appointment with
the FBI about us this week. Of course this isn't confirmed but we'll let you
know which #rock goons start going to prison first. Be sure to check out the
shaedow logs. Peachey turns into a real badass and makes us remember why we
started annoying her in the first place.

Peachey has been doing everything she can lately to avoid us on IRC but she
always makes the same stupid mistakes and we end up finding her. Mainly, no
matter what nick she uses, she always jumps into #peachey for a second to see
if it's taken over which is always is and that's when the fun starts. This
week she's used such creative nicks as peachey, peachey-, cornstarc, sad and
beetle. She also keeps changing her identd which doesn't do much for her.
Remember, we can be contacted at WelovePeachey@hotmail.com so submit your
peachey logs today!

Peachey goes to #2600 for help:
------------------------------
Darklight is an IRC friend of peachey's so we were impersonating him and she
just assumed it was really him without doing a /whois.

  <peachey> hi
<darklight> they took over?
  <peachey> yes
<darklight> dumbasses
  <peachey> yes  i`m sorry
<darklight> about what?
<darklight> hold on... doorbell
  <peachey> the one i got the name and telephone number says he works for 
            the dod and he will come to my house and murder me
<darklight> but does he really??????
  <peachey> i really think he does?? Because he was able to get ALL my 
            family info   even my real name  who he dosent realize is me
  <peachey> they now me as ashley
  <peachey> my new unlisted numbers and address  old and new
<darklight> but i thought they were hackers? 
<darklight> jesus
<darklight> i have to go do something so i'll be back in a few. hope your 
            still there.
  <peachey> k
<darklight> someone still has #peachey. a guy named ping-mask
  <peachey> yes
<darklight> is he one of them? he won't op me
  <peachey> he makes all kind s of trouble 
  <peachey> i guess i`ll just have to give up the net
  <peachey> yes
<darklight> i guess so. but i will be sad. :(
  <peachey> he is one of them  where is he?
<darklight> in #peachey
<darklight> and a guy named s_p just came in
  <peachey> thanks dont be sad
  <peachey> where?
  <peachey> oh yea
<darklight> in #peachey
  <peachey> stay away from them 
<darklight> darn. hold on, i'm being yelled at again. hehe
  <peachey> please come back now
  <peachey> ok play the game dark  you will be the next victim
<darklight> what??
<darklight> i said someone was at the door again
  <peachey> i thought you were with them
<darklight> me???
  <peachey> no meaning yelling with them at them
<darklight> no, my next dorr neighbor kept coming over and i had to leave 
            the keyboard for a second
  <peachey> k
<darklight> hey, i got an idea for you.
  <peachey> what 
<darklight> there is a channel called #2600 and they are hackers but they 
           are NICE hackers
  <peachey> ok
<darklight> so maybe if you go in there and tell them what's going on, they 
            will help you
  <peachey> really?
  <peachey> but are they kids too?
<darklight> they're mostly in their 20's but some are kids
<darklight> but most hackers are good not like them
  <peachey> dark come out of that channel now hurry
<darklight> so it's worth a shot
<darklight> ok
<darklight> it could work. the people in #2600 are a very organized group 
            and they know their stuff and they seem nice. i've been going
            in there the last copple days to see what they're about
  <peachey> you are awesome darklight
  <peachey> they dont notice me?
<darklight> hmmmm.

        [peachey enters #2600 and starts saying dumb things. Then I go to
         #rock and #peachey and tell everyone to come in under fake nicks
         and watch the fun. But they stupidly go in under their real names
         and peachey is too afraid to say anything. I will post part of
         the #2600 log below.]

  <peachey> one of the bad guys just came in
<darklight> none of them are very talkative. #hack is another channel but
            we can't try that tonight because it's invite only.
<darklight> darn
  <peachey> xtort
  <peachey> fat tony too
<darklight> who are they??
<darklight> hey, have you tried hanging out on dal.net? they don't put up 
            with this kind of stuff.
  <peachey> no i dont know how to get there?
<darklight> me neither. i'll ask around
  <peachey> hee heeheeh  
  <peachey> i`m talking to shock from the channel :)  
<darklight> what's he saying?
<darklight> does he know them??
  <peachey> he was lisening telling him to tell all
<darklight> telling you to tell all?
  <peachey> well yea
<darklight> hmmm. this isn't working at all
<darklight> well, if nothing this is an interesting channel tonight
  <peachey> i havent been watching
  <peachey> i1ve been talking to shock>
<darklight> oh
  <peachey> now he`s asking about me??? gesus wants to know my age even?? i 
            dont want to say cause i`m not sure its a good idea?/ at least
            they aren`t looking for me heehehhehh 
<darklight> yeah no kidding.
  <peachey> ha well not that different!!!
<darklight> :)
<darklight> this sucks. the PLA is taking over #2600 now. they're pissing 
            off everyone in there
<darklight> hey, you still there?
  <peachey> yes  wanna help talk to him//
<darklight> guess what? i'm rbcp. look at my /whois you stupid bitch.
<darklight> buhahaha.
<darklight> and you actually thought #2600 could help. i just wanted to see 
            you look like a fool.
<darklight> neener neener neener
<darklight> hey ashley, you there?
  <peachey> i have a bad headache
<darklight> how come?
  <peachey> yes i`m cursed 
<darklight> cursed??
<darklight> i think i can help you for real though
  <peachey> yes i cant straighten this out
<darklight> #peachey can't join channel (it's full)
<darklight> weird
<darklight> you should just move.
<darklight> change your name, start a new life
  <peachey> sure
<darklight> seriously. they couldn't find you then
<darklight> or you could get a new internet provider. there's about 7 
            others to choose from in the boston area.
  <peachey> your more clever than i thought
<darklight> concentric isn't all that great to tell the truth.
  <peachey> i like it though  they always help me
<darklight> yeah, but they're a huge national provider. a local provider 
            will help you much more and will have faster connections
<darklight> i speak from experience. 
  <peachey> who are you?
  <peachey> ok then you see?  i didnt do anything
<darklight> who am i?
  <peachey> yes
<darklight> i'm just giving you advice. i'm trying to be nice. a friend.
  <peachey> ok
<darklight> it's like i always try to help you and give you great advice 
            and then you insult me or threaten me or call me a liar. and
            that really hurts.
  <peachey> cause you confuse me all the time :(
<darklight> well, you have to expect that when you call me a liar. it hurts 
            me.
  <peachey> well ive always told you that i was sorry  that i even would 
            consider being friends..
<darklight> yeah, but then you go right back to calling me dirty names.
  <peachey> i know your over my league  im not trying to compete with you 
            for smarts..
<darklight> i didn't say you were
  <peachey> ok
  <peachey> you always misunderstand me ;(
  <peachey> i dont mean to be fresh  but you hurt me too much
<darklight> all i know is that when your dog died i was there for you.
  <peachey> please dont mention my dog any more ok / please um i told you 
            it makes me sad to joke about him okay  
<darklight> i'm not joking!!
<darklight> okay, acutally i am. when i heard your dog died, i pissed in my 
            pants laughing so hard.
  <peachey> ok
<darklight> stained them beyond repair, ashley!

#2600 log of peachey asking for help:
------------------------------------
I've edited out most of the non-peachey related stuff here. For the most part
this log sucks and not much happens but it's slightly entertaining.

*** peachey (mirc@cnc129048.concentric.net) has joined #2600
<peachey> hi  my name is peachey :)
<peachey> i`m having an awful time with pLA
<peachey> does anyone know them?
*** grapey (irc1@sl26.chrysalis.org) has joined #2600
<grapey> hi!!!!!!!!!
<peachey> Hello 
<grapey> has anyone heard of the PLA?
<grapey> they're really neet guys@!

It goes downhill from there. Mostly peachey is talking privately with shock`
from #2600 who is supposedly helping her.

Peachey warns Colleen again:
---------------------------
Once again, rbcp impersonating Colleen Card.
<peachey> yes
<peachey> can you help?
<colleen> what did he do?
<peachey> hes been calling all night
<peachey> on the phone..
<colleen> he has?? there's no way he can't call for free and our long
          distance got shut off because of him
<peachey> colleen i think he screamed at the baby>>>>
<colleen> well what did he say?
<peachey> do you leave the baby alone with him and his friends??
<colleen> yes all the time. he's nice
<peachey> colleen i heard him scream at the Baby like a maniac
<colleen> he wouldn't do something like that
<peachey> you trust them alone with baby?
<colleen> of course. he's the father.
<peachey> i heard her cry then heard him scream!!!!! at her
<colleen> rbcp is very nice and would never scream at emily.
<colleen> maybe someone else called you.
<peachey> colleen were you home all night?
<colleen> no i work on the weekends.
<peachey> awhhhhhhh gee wish you would listen to me
<colleen> i'm listening
<peachey> are you tatally alone? on this
<colleen> i think it was someone else who called you. rbcp wouldn't do
          that. did he SAY he was rbcp?
<colleen> yes, it's just me and rbcp. my family's all on the west coast
<peachey> hummmmm  well watch for it
<peachey> i heard the baby in the background
<peachey> and his friends sound drunk
<colleen> rbcp is a really nice guy. i mean, he never even hits me when
          emily is in the room.
<colleen> el_jefe has a baby too. i bet it was him
<peachey> he hits you??? you let him??
<colleen> well only when i'm bad so it's okay. i mean, i deserve it you know.
<colleen> hello?
<peachey> gee
<peachey> i dont know what to say

        [Peachey gets a whole new attitude during this part that almost
         makes me like her.]

<colleen> like one time i made him a TV dinner after he'd worked a full 4
          hour shift and he said i was skimping out on my duties so i was
          black and blue for a week after that. i just had to learn to do
          my job and it's okay now.
<peachey> well i csn understand that..he`s a man  agood one at that! and 
          deserves to be taken well cared for 
<colleen> that's true.
<peachey> god men like rbcp are hard to find...
<peachey> at least you won`t make ANY mistakes around him!
<colleen> i know. other men i've dated i could never trust to stay faithful 
          but rbcp is great!
<colleen> that's true and if i do, i'll learn my lesson real quick.
<peachey> oh sure   he sounds like he will ALWAYS be faithful to you!!!
<peachey> but arnt you tempeted to kinda  ummmmm  flirt with his cute 
          buddies?????
<colleen> well, el_jefe's a real stud and we've fooled around a time or two 
          but other than that, rbcp really does it for me.
<peachey> does he know that
<colleen> well, no. if he did he would get out the sissors again. so it's 
          just my little secret.
<peachey> can i have your phone ??? i want to tell you a secret
<colleen> okay, it's 419-586-2345

<peachey> cross country
<colleen> go to colorado
<colleen> i hear it's nice this time of year
<peachey> looking at schools
<peachey> i might look at tuffs right here in boston too
<colleen> they have a really nice university in colorado
<peachey> smith  and bc
<colleen> you'd feel right at home there
<peachey> co state
<colleen> yeah, you'd be only miles from el_jefe
<peachey> where are you again?? ohio?
<colleen> you could go bash in his teeth
<colleen> ohio
<colleen> oHIo
<colleen> OhiO
<colleen> oHio
<colleen> ohIo
<peachey> k
<peachey> mmmmmmmmmmm well actually since i have his phone number he  has 
          tamed down
<colleen> i thought he's been calling you all day
<colleen> him and rbcp and apok and netmask
<peachey> sort of like putting the saddle on the f horse  :)
<colleen> on their 5 way calling
<peachey> noooooooo not apko  i dont think
<colleen> yes, he was on with me and rbcp and el_jefe. we laughed.
<peachey> mostly your hubby tek tsk tsk xxx..and net mask cant remember?
<colleen> no, i'm actually rbcp right now. colleen is at work. and it was 
          me, apok, eljefe and netmask.
<colleen> get it right.
<peachey> im tired
<colleen> why?
<colleen> not sleeping good lately?
<peachey> apok? no cant believe that?
<peachey> nope i couldnt sleep at all last night   
<colleen> why can't you believe that? apok called me, then he put el_jefe 
          on 3-way, then eljefe called netmask and I called you.
<peachey> he just seemed more mature than to do that? i didnt think he 
          could stoop to your levels
<colleen> and the blueprints most definately are on order. takes 3-4 weeks 
          to get to colorado and costs us $35. they're public record.
<colleen> no, apok is a motherfucker just like us.
<colleen> you should ask him what he did to his x-wife. it's funny.
