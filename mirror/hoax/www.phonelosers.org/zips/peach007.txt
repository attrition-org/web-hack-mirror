|  The publishers of this newsletter do not encourage anyone to kill people. |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

As you can see from our new header that in a recent board meeting the
publishers of Peachey Incorporated decided to change their name to something
more appealing to the younger generation of elite computer hackers so we are
now known as the Pink Fluffy Phreaking Bunnies.

What does this mean to you? Well the main change you'll notice is that our new
official colors are pink and baby blue so you'll be able to recognize other
fans of PFPB walking around on the street. If you happen to notice a guy
wearing a pink bandanna or someone in baby blue leotards just walk up to them
and go, "Yo, are you down with the Pink Fluffy Phreaking Bunnies" and you're
sure to get a response.

Why did we change our name? Mainly because basing an e-zine on the some girl
on IRC we used to torment doesn't make much since if you're still publishing
but you haven't heard from that girl in months now. She's still on efnet as
peachangl and her other assorted nicks but I don't think anyone even msgs her
anymore and to tell the truth I'm totally bored with her. Having said that
here are approximately 12 megs of peachey logs for your enjoyment!

            you start saying mean things about my wife and daughter. You're
            really sick and need to be put away.
<peachangl> I hope you mess with the wrong person someday and they come and
            take you to jail. You have no business on the internet doing this
            to innocent people.
<PeAC|aNGL> you are a wrong person for me to be talking to :)   sometimes i
            like feeling sleazy and cheap

<peachangl> or view the image by itself and reload that
<Peac|angl> if it were me I would kick you so hard in the ba**s you wouldn't
            beable to ever hit me again :)))
<peachangl> she did that once and i had to break her toes. it wouldn't have
            done her any good anyway because i don't have any balls
<Peac|angl> hurmmmm

At this point RBCP turns on the live webcam and snaps a picture of himself
apparently hitting Colleen over the head with a 2x4. A little later they
snap another of him punching her in the face and another of him hitting her
on the head with the keyboard. These pictures are archived on

<peachaway> hey
     <rbcp> call me
<peachaway> why so you can tape me
     <rbcp> call me this evening, colleen will be at school and we'll be
            alllll alone! *wink* *wink*
<peachaway> ha
<peachaway> sure
<peachaway> you know what
     <rbcp> i give up
<peachaway> aldous your friend?
     <rbcp> hehe, yeah. the log was hilarious
<peachaway> he is not a good friend of yours
     <rbcp> me and him have known each other for years. he comes over once
            a month to go to the 2600 meetings with me
<peachaway> he gave me your info
     <rbcp> no, sfds did. and it doesn't matter who gave it to you because
            it's listed info. you went through a ton of trouble when all
            you had to do was dial information and ask for it.
<peachaway> not true
<peachaway> sfds didnt give me your address aldous did..why would i lie
            about that?
     <rbcp> <|Peach> maybe if he feels that people know where he lives he
            will stop
     <rbcp> buhahahaha
     <rbcp> i heard that you're rather ticked off at him now.
<peachaway> but it dosent mean sfds gave me the info your "friend" is
            really your worst enemy  he just uses you
<peachaway> he knew he f up so he gave you the logs cause he fears you
     <rbcp> <|Peach> but you see he has my number so if i do anything he
            will do something worse to me :((( babaaaaa i don't know what
            to do :((((
<peachaway> i was lying
     <rbcp> hehe. yeah aldous is my worst enemy. he's a person that i
            just can't trust
     <rbcp> no you weren't
<peachaway> so get him to feel bad
     <rbcp> babaaaaaa!
     <rbcp> why do you even talk to me? put me on ignore and you'll feel
            better.
<peachaway> i don't know?
<peachaway> i guess i want to get revenge
     <rbcp> peachey, that is not going to happen. There is absolutely
            NOTHING you could do to me that would phase me.
<peachaway> did aldous tell you i kicked and banned him from his own channel?
<peachaway> i loved it soooooooooooooo much I feel sooooooooooooooooooo
            darn f good about it too :))))))))))
     <rbcp> Your best bet would be to quit talking to me. Put me on ignore
            if I bother you so much. You need to learn the difference between
            IRC Life and Real Life. You act like a little kid or something.

   <Peachy> just im kinda down right now :( sensitive ya know?
   <Peachy> i cry easy sometimes
<peachangl> because you always act depressed because of how you're treated
            on irc so if IRC wasn't there then maybe you'd be happier. I
            don't hate you but you're always screwing with me and threatening
            me and stuff so what do you expect me to do?
   <Peachy> but i bet you know that
   <Peachy> i dont always threaten you? i tried to be nice
<peachangl> bullshit, you're just pissed because i have the same nick as you.
            and i'm not the only one who messes with you.
   <Peachy> actually ive tried real hard
   <Peachy> well dont mess with me :(
<peachangl> you always start it
   <Peachy> no i dont?
<peachangl> If you don't like me talking to you then put my domain on your
            ignore list. That's all it would take.
   <Peachy> i quit always first
   <Peachy> show me how and i will
<peachangl> don't be an idiot, it's point and click. you know how.
   <Peachy> no i dont!
   <Peachy> i have you on ignore but not the domain?
<peachangl> ask someone in new2mirc or mirc4fun. just about any 12 year
            old could tell you.
   <Peachy> no
   <Peachy> i hate u
<peachangl> then you will continue you deal with me. you're extrememly stupid
   <Peachy> i want to be with my friends
<peachangl> you're either really stupid or you actually enjoy it when i
            talk to you
   <Peachy> not you
   <Peachy> dont u understand that?
<peachangl> no i don't. you get all depressed when i talk to you so what's
            the point? Ban my domain and you won't have to deal with me ever
            ever again. That's all it takes. I've been telling you this for
            a fucking year now.
   <Peachy> k

|        MLAC Listing of the OCI Building in Dallas, Texas - by RBCP         |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
I was recently walking down the street, feeling depressed and having nothing
to do when out of nowhere a 10 page report carried by the wind blows along
and slaps me in the face. As I'm pulling it away, I notice that it happens to
be a Southwestern Bell list of every phone number going into a building in
Dallas, Texas which of course is where OCI's silly operators are
headquartered. What luck! So for your reading pleasure, here is a list of
every phone number going into the OCI building, conveniently sorted by cable
and pair.

Keep in mind that OCI aren't the only occupants in that building so there
might be a little bit of extra fluff in this list but since they're the
biggest presence there they have the most lines.  The coolest number by far
has to be the elevator phone number.  You can call in and talk to whoever is
in the elevator. Woo hoo!
