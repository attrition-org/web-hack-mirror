So this is issue two. There's absolutely nothing in here but IRC logs and if
you've been to the Peachey Fan Club Page (members.tripod.com/~amandapeachey)
then you're not going to find anything new in this issue. Issue three, however
will definately have the latest and greatest in peachey's history with new IRC
logs (of course), telephone transcripts and possibly interviews with the local
Marblehead newspapers and/or police department.

One slight update from the previous issue - after finding out it was useless
to change her phone number, Peachey & Family changed it back into the original
number which is 617-639-0224. Apparently they think they're going to sue the
phone company for handing out unlisted numbers when it was actually Spanish
Prince who got the number from one of her stupid friends. We can now be
emailed at WeLovePeachey@hotmail.com for submissions or comments. Look for
issue three, hopefully sometime this week!

 <phelon> last time i checked, rbcp's number was 419-586-2345 and his name 
          is Roy something
<peachey> why does eljefe always say he is roy?
 <phelon> he's making fun of rbcp probably.

 <phelon> is that picture from the 2600 meeting really you? by the way, i 
          just called that 612 number and it's busy.
 <phelon> at the 770 number some lady answered.

 <phelon> red
 <phelon> if it is, you're cute.
<peachey> it could be me then :(
<peachey> thanks
 <phelon> kinda curly red hair? long?
<peachey> yup :( i wish i were dead
 <phelon> geez, they had it blown up to about 1 foot by 2 feet and there 
          were about 6 of them on all the trees with your phone number
          printed below them
<peachey> why are you torturing me????????? i told you i cant handle this
 <phelon> what? I didn't do it! I'm just telling you about it
<peachey> what did you mean about the three phone lines??????
 <phelon> i was on the phone with at&t's assignment center just seeing how
          many phone lines went into your house. i'm bored
<peachey> how can you do that???how do you do it? thats not legal?
 <phelon> i can do anything. :) i can get unlisted numbers too
<peachey> how??? you dont have any info at all on me
 <phelon> i have your phone number and when i give them that, they tell me the
          name on the account and how many lines go into the house and the
          numbers of all the other lines. don't worry, i didn't ask for them
<peachey> i don`t know what to do i`m really terrified and i thought 
          that that was private secure info? i`m calling the police
 <phelon> i wasn't trying to freak you out. i just mess with the at&t 
          office when i'm bored. that's all. sheeze, calm down a little.
<peachey> please i`m so frieghted  this is no joke to me
<peachey> well they are not suppose to tell that info
 <phelon> i wasn't joking, i was simply plowing through your account 
          information and romping freely.
 <phelon> they think i work for nynex.
<peachey> how???????????????????????????????????
 <phelon> cause that's what i told them and i gave them a nynex 
          employee code. it's easy.
<peachey> can anyone else do that?
<peachey> so i better kill myself cause if thats the case i am doomed  
          i cant sleep as it is
 <phelon> anyone who takes the time to learn, i'm sure they could. it's 
          not really that hard, they just have bad security.
<peachey> i`m so scared and upset ...can you make them leave me alone?
 <phelon> i don't control these people. they're like the biggest cyber-gang 
          in that area. there's not much influencing them. especially a
          little nobody like me
<peachey> i wish there was someone i could trust.
<peachey> you could make them stop  you belong to that awful group
 <phelon> do not
 <phelon> have you been to rbcp's irc logs page yet? there's about 12 chat 
          logs of you on irc.
<peachey> should or can i call the telephne co and tell them about giving 
          info out?
 <phelon> won't do any good. if they stop, then their employees can't get 
          info either.
<peachey> are they very bad??? ummm my web s arent working
 <phelon> turn off the images on your netscape. that should make it not crash.
<peachey> but you dont have the names or address to confirm
 <phelon> confirm what?
<peachey> please tell me about the info on a private number?
<peachey> why did you leave me?
 <phelon> click on netscape options, then uncheck the auto-load images thing
 <phelon> i couldn't see that channel. my irc is messed up
<peachey> will i be upset if i see the logs??????
 <phelon> i dunno. depends on how sensitive you are. 
<peachey> i cant look:( i am very sensitive :(
 <phelon> hehe. they're not that bad. just chat logs and all of your personal 
          information and your pic and a pic of a dead dog or something
<peachey> what personal info?
 <phelon> i dunno. havent been there in a few days. they had all your 
          relatives listed, i think and a picture of your pic on a tree.
<peachey> relatives?//?? who?????
 <phelon> i don't know. i haven't visited in like a week now
<peachey> whats the url?
 <phelon> www.bright.net/~bac/pla/irc.htm
 <phelon> are you still there?
<peachey> it still freezes
 <phelon> oh well. it's really funny. has pictures of dead dogs lying all over
          the road  and morphed pictures of you and your family and tons of
          chat logs that make you look really stupid. this chat log will be
          added to it in the morning
<peachey> you should be very proud
 <phelon> why's that?
 <phelon> well?
 <phelon> you know this would all end if you'd just give me netsex tonight
 <phelon> so start netsexing right now

	[The next day...]

<peachey> good that makes me happy to hear :)
 <phelon> after all we've been through
<peachey> yes shut up
<phelon> let me ask you a question - why do you continue to hang out on irc?
         you can't go into any channels without being hassled (and this IS
         your own fault no matter what you'd like to believe) and everyone
         just pisses you off. it seems you'd realize that staying off irc is
         a good idea. everyone just laughs at you
<peachey> thanks... i needed that... thanks...
<peachey> ***
<peachey> i`m so depressed
 <phelon> i'm serious. it's pointless. why are you here???

	[I just her channel, #peachey, and she kicks me out.]

<peachey> and stay out you moron
 <phelon> was that supposted to make me sad?
 <phelon> :(
