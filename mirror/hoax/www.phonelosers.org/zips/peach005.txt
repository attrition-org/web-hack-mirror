So, uh, I guess me and peachey are the best of friends now. Or are we?
Let's fast-forward to 1998. It's been awhile and these previous four
issues of Peachey Inc. were kept to ourselves for over a year but now
that they've been released we may as well go on with the story. I hadn't
heard about or talked to peachey for almost a year and then suddenly she
started messaging me again. And of course I started messing with her and
archiving everything.




Session Start: Fri Oct 09 17:05:43 1998

In the following log peachey thinks she's talking to Colleen Card,
but really Colleen is just sitting next to me and laughing at it all.

Session Start: Thu Nov 12 20:56:56 1998
<PeachAngl> hello
<PeachAngl> colleen?
<PeachAngl> hello how are you and the baby?
     <rbcp> hehe, fine. she's not a baby anymore though. :)
     <rbcp> she's 2 1/2 now
<PeachAngl> wowoow great  she is very pretty :)
     <rbcp> thanks!
     <rbcp> wow, we haven't talked in over 6 months now. what have you
            been up to? we moved to illinois a few months ago
<PeachAngl> thats nice wow do u like it?
     <rbcp> well, there's more to do here since we're not in the
            boonies anymore so it's better
<PeachAngl> is rbcp home?
     <rbcp> upstairs playing stickers with emily
<PeachAngl> can u get him for me :)
     <rbcp> get him?
<PeachAngl> and colleen will u please ask him to help me
     <rbcp> help you? what's happened? i heard they virused your
            computer or something.
<PeachAngl> yes el-jefe deleted my entire computer :((
<PeachAngl> it was so mean  nobody should ever have to go threw that

Apparently a few evil hacker types from the 303 area managed to
convince peachey that installing Back Orifice on her computer
would be a good thing.

     <rbcp> jeez i'm sorry. they just deleted the hard drive right?
     <rbcp> our friend a few miles away - they virused his computer
            and he had to buy a new hard drive
<PeachAngl> yes mine is still not right and i lost everyones things :(
     <rbcp> i still don't understand how they do that kind of stuff.
            i don't even like rbcp talking to el_jefe anymore because
            i'm afraid el_jefe will end up getting us in trouble again
<PeachAngl> oh he will el-jefe has pissed off lots of people lately
<PeachAngl> i mean to do a thing like that to someone is beyond mean,
            funny etc no joke at all
     <rbcp> were you able to recover the data?
     <rbcp> we have like 5 gigs of stuff on our computer, i can't
            imagine what we'd do if we lost most of it.
<PeachAngl> no i will never recover data that was placed there for safe
            keeping :(  i feel so sick and ashammed about it
     <rbcp> well did you get ANY of it back? you should just be able to
            run the recover command and it would find most of it.
<PeachAngl> no i had to completely have the hd reformated
     <rbcp> what size of hard drive? you can probably still recover most
            of it. when you format a drive, it doesn't actually erase
            the data, it just removed the references to it. so the data
            is STILL on your hard drive, you just have to recover it. :)
<PeachAngl> couldnt it was so messed had someone for $125 an hour do it
     <rbcp> darn. well i'm really sorry that had to happen. i wish i had
            el_jefe's phone number and i'd call him up and yell about it.
<PeachAngl> me too  is his name andy?
<PeachAngl> anyway i want to talk to rbcp very badly
     <rbcp> el_jefe's? i think his name is Roy, we actually never knew
            him that well. Want me to go get rbcp?
<PeachAngl> yes i want to ask him to please please remove the logs he has
            of me on his page  its causing me alot of grief still  please
            its just not fair anymoreand rpcp keeps it there  please
            please ask him to remove it

She's referring to these Peachey Inc. issues, of course.

Session Start: Fri Nov 13 22:40:38 1998
<PeachAngl> hi
     <rbcp> this is colleen again. alex took down those peachey logs.
            sorry about him
<PeachAngl> did he get an e-mail form someone named simi-lost?
     <rbcp> lemme check..
<PeachAngl> k
<PeachAngl> check the logs too
     <rbcp> it doesn't look like it but he might have deleted it.
     <rbcp> what am i checking for?
<PeachAngl> well i am lookin at the site now..it's still there...i
            just don't think he would really like it if ppl did that
            to him..so why does he do it to others?
     <rbcp> try reloading the screen, it's gone.
<PeachAngl> i ust want to know why it is still tere after he said it
            was there.
<PeachAngl> i did..i did a refresh...let me clear my cache and look
            again..just a sec
<PeachAngl> colleen how is emily?
<PeachAngl> well..i dumped my cache and the page still loads...that
            means it is still up.

Several minutes later...

-> (-el_jefe-) hey, i'm going to be mean to peachey in a second okay?
     <rbcp> well??? :)
     <rbcp> wow, i'm on your notify list, i feel so honored.
<PeachAngl> just because i wanted to be able to talk to you about
            that page.
     <rbcp> okay, try it now. reload, i fixed it myself
<PeachAngl> ok sec

At this point I was sick of her begging me every day to take down those
logs, so I changed the page she was reloading to have nothing up there
but a huge picture of her along with a few insulting comments underneath.
This didn't set well with her since she was under the impression that we
were all cyber-buddies now.

     <rbcp> x0x0x0x0x
<PeachAngl> well isn't that special?...i really have no idea why you
            want to do something like this
     <rbcp> what?
     <rbcp> what do you mean?
     <rbcp> i took down the logs
<PeachAngl> put up a page calling me a dumb whore?..how would you like
            it if someone started to slander you on the web?
     <rbcp> oh shit, a hacker hacked my irc page! i swear i didn't
            do that
<PeachAngl> oh yeh right...that just changed in what..5 mins?
     <rbcp> those hackers are FAST!
     <rbcp> i mean, look how quickly they formatted your drive!
     <rbcp> hey, i'll send you a file that will let you change the
            page yourself. okay?
<PeachAngl> you know ...you are really a muscle flexer behind
            your cheesey 486 screen..but you prob wouldn't like to
            meet me in real life..
     <rbcp> er, what?
     <rbcp> let me reboot, maybe that will get those hackers out
            of my computer!
<PeachAngl> that isn't on your computer
<PeachAngl> that is on a server
     <rbcp> oh my god! i bet the guy who hosts phonelosers.org is
            being hacked! i better go call him right now!
<PeachAngl> ya really think i may not be as smart as you think..but
            i have had someone working with me teaching me all this..
            i am learning fast too...don't try and jack me around
     <rbcp> wow, you sure are smart! what should i do?? what
            should i do??
     <rbcp> maybe if i'm smart as you, i won't run a program that a
            hacker gives me. oh wait, never mind.
<PeachAngl> hhhmm..maybe ya should make your next 2600 meeting in
            december...my friend would really like to try and work
            things out with you...he is willing to sit down and talk
            about things like a man
<PeachAngl> well that was then..this is now
<PeachAngl> or does it bother you that there would be no screen
            between the both of you?
     <rbcp> yeah, a week can really make a difference
     <rbcp> the next 2600 meeting IS in december
<PeachAngl> at the galleria...he says he has shopped there amny times
     <rbcp> send him my pic, i'm there every month will to talk
            to anybody
<PeachAngl> hard to do that when you all deleted it for me

            face or on your ass!
     <rbcp> yeah, i was sending him psychic vibes, egging him on

<peachangl> depressed. el_jefe calling me all day and all night
    <Micki> Your son?
<peachangl> no, some punk in colorado. i don't know if i mentioned
            him to you before but he has been bothering me for
            years now
    <Micki> Shit, no! That's all you need. Calling you on the
            phone? Bob must be having kittens.
<peachangl> hehe yep. it's pretty sad but he understands
<peachangl> how have you been
    <Micki> Thank god for that then. What's new? Kids home? Plans
            for holidays? I never really get a chance to talk anymore.
<peachangl> We're going to downtown Boston for a nighttime christmas
            caroling with the homeless people on 4th street. Other
            than that not doing anything  special
    <Micki> Better, don't have to type the name all the time.
    <Micki> Aw Bev, that sounds like fun....I'll meet you, we can go
            together (I wish)
<peachangl> yer just lazy
    <Micki> I would love to be in Boston, snowed today I heard.
<peachangl> oh yeah, nothing but snow. and zero temperatures
<peachangl> it's miserable outside but i'm glad winter is finally here
    <Micki> Same here, went to see "You've got Mail" tonight - nice
            movie, and took 20 minutes to get into the bloody car.
<peachangl> locks iced over?
    <Micki> Icy and very cold. Not quite, but almost....
    <Micki> The tops of the doors freeze.
-> (-el_jefe-) peachey's real name is beverly
<peachangl> ah
    <Micki> Plans for Xmas?
<peachangl> man i'm tired. was kept up all last night with phone calls
    <Micki> Why doesn't he stop calling?
<peachangl> nope no plans, just gonna hang out with Zac and stuff
<peachangl> i don't know, i never did anything to him. he virused
            my computer last month and thinks it's hilarious
    <Micki> Ah, that's what happened to the puter, little shit...
            ....What about Zeb?
<peachangl> Both of 'em, going to their house
<peachangl> that's about it
-> (-logicbox-) holy shit!@ This lady KNOWS peachey@#@
    <Micki> How's the furries?
<peachangl> they died
    <Micki> WHAT???

At this point I feel the conversation is going nowhere so I start being
really idiotic at Micki. I have no idea what "furries" are supposed to
be but I do a pretty good job at faking it.

<peachangl> You didn't hear?
    <Micki> NO! Bev, that's awful......
    <Micki> What happened?
<peachangl> I brought my big foot down on top of 'em and SQUISH! It
            was a mess to clean up
    <Micki> Peachy, tell me, not all of them?
<peachangl> well, one survived
    <Micki> Peach, how could you step on three at the same time?
<peachangl> and i fucked that one up the ass.
<peachangl> It was smelly. i liked it
<peachangl> hello?
    <Micki> WHO THE HELL IS THIS ANYWAY????????????????????????????
<peachangl> el_jefe
<peachangl> who are you?
<peachangl> By the way, thanks for confirming her name is Beverly. I
            always wondered if Zac and Zeb were really related to her.
DCC session closed


The next day Micki is sitting in #broadway so me and el_jefe hop in
there to see if we can stir up any trouble. I'm still using the nick
peachangl.

<peachangl> don't talk to me
    <nickh> geez
    <nickh> okay.    bye.


Peachey finally decides that the only way to combat the problem of
me stealing her nick is to steal MY nick. That will teach me a thing
or two. Unfortunately for her the only time I'm ever on IRC anymore
is when I'm idling as her just to see what people say to me so her
plan fails.

     <rbcp> who?
<peachangl> I would tell you but I'm a little ticked off
            that you stole my nick
     <rbcp> whats the nick?
     <rbcp> you stole mine :(
<peachangl> oh try to blame it on ME now
     <rbcp> what?

<peachangl> i don't use f as a nick
     <rbcp> this rbcp i am going to keep it forever
<peachangl> oh. okay.
<peachangl> you can have it, that nick is overrated anyway.
            I like peachangl better.
<peachangl> It fits my personality better
     <rbcp> please why cant we just be friends now?
     <rbcp> i havent bother you
     <rbcp> right
<peachangl> i don't even know you, you're the one bothering me.
            I was sitting here innocently talking to my friends
            and you starting msging me
     <rbcp> your hopeless and i truly despise you
<peachangl> This guy wants to call me, is it okay to give him my
            home phone number?
     <rbcp> i you do you will die
<peachangl> if you despise me you should leave me the hell alone
     <rbcp> please please have a heart!!!!!!
     <rbcp> i want to taLK to  colleen please
<peachangl> No Eric that's bullshit. If she doesn't want to get
            beaten then she can divorce my ass.
<peachangl> oh, wrong window. sorry
<peachangl> you're the one bothering ME. I'm just sitting here!
     <rbcp> what?
<peachangl> leave me alone!
     <rbcp> can i talk to colleen?
     <rbcp> not you
<peachangl> This is colleen. i was just pretending to be rbcp
<peachangl> haha, funny joke. :)
<peachangl> do you really want my phone number?
     <rbcp> yes
<peachangl> go to http://www.phonelosers.org/sound.html and
            listen to all the sound clips. My phone number is
            mentioned in several of the newer ones
<peachangl> so is my name
     <rbcp> no i dont like to see the trash you put in there
     <rbcp> just give it to me and ill call
<peachangl> then call information. Two of our phone numbers are
            published. I'm not trying to protect my number but
            why should i give it to you? Just do about 2 minutes
            of detective work and you'll get my number. Use your
            head.
     <rbcp> no never mind :( the last time you sent me there i saw
            those pictures :(( i don't want to see stuff like that
<peachangl> don't go there then, dial 1-618-555-1212 and get our
            number. It will take you less than a minute and you can
            call us all you want.
     <rbcp> they need a city
     <rbcp> and a name
<peachangl> you have my name. and my city is clearly stated about
            50 times on my homepage
<peachangl> look at http://www.phonelosers.org/rbcp to learn all
            about my city
     <rbcp> why can't you just tell me?
<peachangl> because you're being lazy. If you want something you
            can't expect everyone to hand it over to you. Like I
            said, do just a minute or two of research and you'll
            have my number.
     <rbcp> you must have a reason not to give it to me :(
     <rbcp> i told you i trusted you thje last time and u lied
     <rbcp> im afraid to look
     <rbcp> just give it
<peachangl> Just leave me alone. I'm not bothering you and if you don't
            want to take the time to get my number yourself then you
            don't need to have it.
     <rbcp> :( can i just have my nick back then
<peachangl> I might consider that but since you've been threatening
            my friends and telling them that you're going to send
            someone to my house to "take care of me" I don't really
            think I owe you anything.
     <rbcp> ok i won't say that ever again
     <rbcp> friends :)
     <rbcp> and ill give you yours back
<peachangl> i don't want mine back. And you can't just threaten
            peoples' lives and expect them to be nice to you
     <rbcp> i didn't threaten you? i just said i wanted to visit
     <rbcp> keep it stick it
     <rbcp> i don't care
<peachangl> fuck off
<peachangl> and i hope you call me, i have a few things to say to you

She never called and never tried the easiest way to get our phone number
which would have been to dial information and ask for it. Instead she
spent the evening threatening this sfds guy until he handed over our
number but he didn't give her the address yet so she decided to try one
of the tricks from the PLA page. This is really bizzare - peachey calls
my house (the number comes in anonymous) and she pretends to be with
AT&T Collections.

I have absolutely no idea that it's peachey but she goes on and on about
how I owe money to AT&T and that I need to get this taken care of or it'll
go against my credit. Then she wants to "confirm" my address and when I
tell her to go ahead and I'll confirm if she's right or wrong, she says
that AT&T isn't allowed to give out that kind of information over the phone.

Then I start telling her that I don't believe she's AT&T and she keeps
insisting she is so I tell her to let me call her back at her desk and
she begins stuttering. Then I start being really rude and obnoxious and
eventually she hangs up. This whole time I had no idea that it was her but
about 10 minutes later I think, "Gee, that had to be peachey."

<PeachAngl> no really i did not
     <rbcp> you called and committed a federal offense by
            impersonating an AT&T rep.
<PeachAngl> because you said you got A phone call i thought you
            were refering to a single one
<PeachAngl> your golden retriever looks depressed :(
<PeachAngl> look will you stop the bull with me
<PeachAngl> turn around and smile in you cam
     <rbcp> I recognize your voice very well and if you'll read
            the part of my homepage where it talks about my desk, you'll
            notice that it mentions how i record all incoming and outgoing
            phone calls to my number. I have the whole thing on tape. I'll
            turn it into a realaudio file later and let everyone hear how
            you stuttered through the whole conversation.
     <rbcp> it's funny as hell, you should call me more often
<PeachAngl> whatever if you do that i will never talk to you again
<PeachAngl> which u would like right
<PeachAngl> anyway i will deny it
     <rbcp> i don't care if you talk to me. and if it's not really you then
            you have nothing to worry about. but we both know that you
            called me 30 minutes ago.
<PeachAngl> it dosent sound like me anyway
<PeachAngl> i will deny it totally cause you are a liar and everyone knows it
     <rbcp> i don't care if you deny it, everyone who hears it is going to
            laugh their asses off. it's just another chapter in the peachey book.
     <rbcp> Watch the page for Peachey Incorporated #6! :)
<PeachAngl> please
     <rbcp> please what? I thought it really wasn't you
<PeachAngl> please dont do this
<PeachAngl> i really want to talk to you off the record
     <rbcp> That was the funniest call I've gotten all year, someone who calls
            ME pretending to be AT&T, stutters at all my retorts and tries to
            get my home address which is listed in the phone book in the
            first place.
<PeachAngl> i want to tell you something but cant
     <rbcp> don't tell me then
<PeachAngl> :(
<PeachAngl> how can you be so cruel?
<PeachAngl> this is entrapment
     <rbcp> So what is "all this info" you have on me? My name and phone
            number? Believe me, if you want to compare info and can find out
            stuff about you that even YOU don't know. So go ahead and keep
            feeding me my info, this should be enjoyable.
<PeachAngl> i believe you
     <rbcp> won't it be funny when i have a sound clip on PLA's sound clip
            page of peachey pranking ME? Buhaha, this rules.

<PeachAngl> btw i really do not understand you at all
     <rbcp> You shouldn't be involving me in your federal offenses if
            you don't want to get hurt
<PeachAngl> why you want me to hurt like this? you ruined my time on
            this net

     <rbcp> oooo, give it to me sexy!
     <rbcp> i want it!
<PeachAngl> uh huh
<PeachAngl> do u know Gwonk?
     <rbcp> Yeah, i had sex with him this weekend
<PeachAngl> hes says you better not put that phone caLL in to the web
<PeachAngl> i don't think he has sex with other males
     <rbcp> you shouldn't have called if you didn't want that to happen
     <rbcp> it will happen as soon as i get a little spare time
<PeachAngl> no
     <rbcp> yup
     <rbcp> i'm sure of it
<PeachAngl> just end it here
     <rbcp> what do you care anyway, you told me you didn't make the call
<PeachAngl> :(
<PeachAngl> but you are going to say i did
     <rbcp> that's because you did.
<PeachAngl> but why cant you be like my brother and be nice to me?
     <rbcp> It's not my fault if you did something as stupid as that. But
            if you look at my sound clips page you'll see that I always post
            humorous incoming phone calls to my house. Look at all the
            telemarketing calls on http://www.phonelosers.org/sound.html and
            you'll see what i mean. This is just another one of those.
     <rbcp> your brother thinks you're a whore
<PeachAngl> no
<PeachAngl> cause i am not
<PeachAngl> please why can't we be friends now?
     <rbcp> what is with you? You always do this - first you threaten me then
            you ask me to please do something for you. Life just doesn't work
            that way. You've been threatening to "get me" for like a year now
            so why is it so surprising that I'm mean to you on IRC?
<PeachAngl> no i have been very good  Ypu started with me this time and i
            goof up :(
     <rbcp> No I was innocently sitting there yesterday with your nick and
            you start threatening me.
<PeachAngl> but i know now it was a bad mistake
<PeachAngl> forgive me this time?
     <rbcp> There you go again, asking me for something immediately after
            you threaten me. Stupid stupid stupid.
     <rbcp> Why don't you ever leave the house anyway? You're sitting there on
            IRC 24 hours a day
<PeachAngl> when did i threaten you? hey
<PeachAngl> i am a prisoner
     <rbcp> how are you a prisoner?
<PeachAngl> long story
<PeachAngl> maybe i work at home :) like you
     <rbcp> doubt it
     <rbcp> i hope you don't do phone work because you were the most
            un-official sounding person I've ever talked with. I didn't even
            realize it was you until minutes after we hung up but you sounded
            fake from the beginning. You need to find a new act.
<PeachAngl> but then it was good if you didnt know who it was?
     <rbcp> I didn't have any idea who you were but it was obvious that you
            were not from AT&T.
     <rbcp> I'm not even a paranoid person but my first thought was, "This
            person is trying to get my address from me."
