With all the recent IRC hype over the ultra-popular, one & only badass
herself, peachey, we've decided to release this semi-monthly 'zine to keep
others updated on the current happenings in the peachey saga.  Things are
really heating up lately and I expect some really interesting things to
happen in her life (as well as ours if she gets the feds involved) in the
near future.

For the first issue, I'm just going to list a bunch of old, yet entertaining
peachey logs & some basic information about her. This issue will be short but
the next Peachey Inc. will be out very soon because I have alot more logs to
put in. If you have something to submit, contact a PLAer on efnet's #rock. By
next issue we should have an e-mail address.

                Just Who The Hell Is This Peachey Character?                
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴켸
Peachey is an ordinary girl from Boston, Massachusetts who one day decided to
come into efnet's #rock and talk about rock music. This was her first mistake.
As most people either know or find out the hard way, #rock was taken over a
few years ago by a bunch of Phone Losers of America goons. #rock regulars
began to insult her and msged her constantly for days after that. They also
began to follow her all over IRC into every channel she went into, harassing
the people & saying mean things about peachey until both them & peachey were
kick-banned. If one person got kicked, though, another #rock goon would take
their place and talk about peachey until she was either kicked or would leave
in embarassment.

Finally someone chatted with her enough to convince her that they were a
friend and peachey was dumb enough to give them her home phone number. Almost
immediately her life was ruined. Mainly el_jefe, who has no life and a ton of
spare time on his hands spent alot of time calling her and roying her to
death. She claimed that he was calling at all hours of the day and night and
that her parents were getting mad and yelling at her for getting calls so
late. She said she couldn't take the phone off the hook or turn off the ringer
because her dad was a doctor and they needed the phone for emergencies.

This went on for way over a month and everytime we called, peachey would
appear on IRC and beg everyone to quit. Since that didn't seem to work, she'd
resort to threatening random people out of #rock, saying she was going to "get
them!" This didn't settle well with the people in #rock. Everyone began msging
her, pretending to be her friend or just plain harassing her and sometimes
logging the fun. More and more people began to call her at home and peachey
finally found a channel she could hang out in without being bothered  too
much - #depression.

Finally peachey (or her parents?) broke down and changed their phone number
around the middle of May 1997. Since we didn't have any other information on
her other than her real first name, which was Ashley, finding her new number
was sort of difficult. Then one day Spanish Prince went on IRC and changed
his nick to "peachey" to see if he'd get msged. Apparently one of peachey's
legitimate friends thought that he was the real peachey and fired up a
conversation with "her."

In the end, Spanish Prince asked, "You have my new number, right?" and the
friend replied, "Yes, 1081." which gave us her new unlisted phone number!
During this time, RBCP was going crazy nuts trying to find her information in
any way he could. Mostly he called up local pizza joints and video stores,
looking to see if she had an account listed under her old phone number.
Finally he found one at Videoscope (617-631-4898) listed under the names
Beverly, Zac & Zeb Edwards at 16 Cornell.

After getting the name Zac & Zeb, he tried a few net phone books and came up
with Zac & Zeb Edwards, 288 Pleasant St, Marblehead, MA, 617-631-8454. For
now, that's all the info we're going to print. Next issue we'll have verified
everything (hopefully) and gotten the rest of their numbers from FACS. Check
the ZIP for the elite peachey pic which should be enclosed.

Below are a bunch of IRC logs involving peachey and various other people. This
first one is between RBCP and peachey. At the time, RBCP was impersonating
Dazen so he's using that nick throughout most of the log.

         of the conversation. Below is part of a log where I convinced
         her that I was really Dazen who apparently she's good friends
         with now or something.]

I simply MUST call Bangladesh on your bill:
------------------------------------------
This one is rather weird. I'm assuming that "peachster" is actually Logic Box.
The log I had of this was really screwed up.

peachster: HI HI HI
peachster: what's up?
  peachey: hi who are you?
peachster: a person who wants to bring el_jefe down just as much as you do
peachster: down with el_jefe!
  peachey: what # do you go to?
peachster: I sometimes spy on him and his evil PLA friends in #rock
peachster: they are evil I tell you!
peachster: they talk about you sometimes
  peachey: wow Hi there
peachster: hi
  peachey: how come your mad at him?
  peachey: gee i know that..
peachster: he called me almost nonstop for about two weeks straight
  peachey: why do you type so slow?
  peachey: what do they say?

           and get even madder at me??/ so sorry
  peachey: no i have a close up of him
peachster: I won't tell anyone
peachster: hello? can you give me his number?

  peachey: but he is so scary looking too
peachster: yeah, I know
  peachey: i bet his mom thinks he is a cutie though
peachster: how did you get his number?
  peachey: my dad had it traced
peachster: really?
peachster: cool
  peachey: yup
peachster: is your dad a cop?
  peachey: nope
  peachey: but has friends
peachster: do you think they can help us get rid of el_jefe?

           been looking for it
  peachey: but i told dad he was not going to call during the night anymore
           so he`s giving him one more chance
  peachey: but i can`t tell eljefe this cause he wont listen to me?

  peachey: i think she is a bi sexual?

  peachey: dont know?
peachster: ok, how bout if I tell you his real name, and you give me
           his number?

           give me the area code and prefix of his phone number, then I tell
           you his last name, then you tell me the suffix of his phone number

           last name, then you tell me the suffix
  peachey: 303
peachster: and the prefix?
  peachey: last name?
peachster: you have to give me the prefix first, then I give you the
           last name, then you give me the suffix
  peachey: phone brb
peachster: ok
  peachey: hi
peachster: hello

Here's a log of Shaedow & Peachey. This one is really cool, especially since
peachey is so grateful towards him that she dcc's him her picture and offers

Once again, Peachey thinks she has a friend:
-------------------------------------------
This one is rather confusing. I'm not sure exactly who's log it is but it's
funny as hell.

 -> [dazen] there?
 -> [dazen] wake up fuxor
   [jer0me] what's she saying?
-> [jer0me] loggin, sec
   [jer0me] cool
-> [jer0me] does she know what state you are in?
   [jer0me] colorado, cause she has fr0gg'd info, other than that, no
    [srain] could you check your dimcom mail for my pgp message?
 -> [srain] got it.. take me a while to decrypt it tho. pgp is on the laptop
    [srain] cool.  it is just account infoz.
 -> [srain] for local?
    [srain] sek.org
 -> [srain] if so, vox me real quick and I can do it faster
    [srain] w3rd.
-> [jer0me] she thinks yo live in aurora...
   [jer0me] yeah, she has all fr0gg's info, she's totally convinced
            that' who I am
-> [jer0me] hahaha
-> [jer0me] haha.. evanston ct
   [jer0me] hehehehehe
-> [jer0me] should i verify tht is your address?
-> [jer0me] or make her wonder..
   [jer0me] yessir!
   [jer0me] verify
-> [jer0me] she is asking where your family is
   [jer0me] mexico
   [jer0me] say I reall am black :)
-> [jer0me] haha. some nigga from mexico
   [jer0me] el_nigger :)
->[peachey] jer0me is off irc now.
  [peachey] k
  [peachey] so tell me what his number is?tell me do you know it?
->[peachey] see, you are so mean and untrusting towards me, but you say we
            can be friends?
->[peachey] i know how to get ahold of him. i know his home line and his
            pager number. i have his cell number written down somewhere i
            think (if he still has it)
  [peachey] thats not being mean?
->[peachey] whats not being mean?
->[peachey] I am trying to be nice and help you.
  [peachey] cant you see how horrible he is? cant you see it?
->[peachey] he is only like that to you though. Since he is nice to everyone
            else I have to think that maybe you did something that caused
            this. He is usually a nice guy.
  [peachey] how can you help?
 -> [srain] right..
->[peachey] Tell him to quit.
->[peachey] Like I said, he listens to me. But you seem to mean and
            untrusting towards me.
  [peachey] he wont listen to anybody
->[peachey] who knows him?
->[peachey] i'm sorry you feel that way, but your lack of trust towards me is
            annoying.
  [peachey] everyone of them say they will help and they just lie
->[peachey] oh.. i see. I am just like everyone else. Ok.
  [peachey] i want to trust you so much honest
->[peachey] nevermind. be on your own.
  [peachey] please
  [peachey] please dont leave me
->[peachey] why? so you can be mean to me?
  [peachey] see your mean too
->[peachey] i can go to my girlfriend if I want abuse.
  [peachey] i am nice honest
  [peachey] what do you want me to do tell me
->[peachey] trust me when I say I will try to help. I can't guarantee
            anything, but I can try.
  [peachey] k
->[peachey] do you have caller ID? how often does he call?
  [peachey] yes
->[peachey] does it every say anything on the CID machine?
  [peachey] sometimes all threw the night
  [peachey] the police are tracing his calls
->[peachey] what does he say? and do you ever leave the phone off the hook?
->[peachey] police can't help. he knows as much about phone systems as I do.
  [peachey] but he puts my number in the sex places too
  [peachey] and other ppl have called
->[peachey] who else?
  [peachey] like rbcp
->[peachey] what does he say, and how do you react?
->[peachey] (this is all important)
  [peachey] hes royyyyyyyyyy
  [peachey] and swears at my family
->[peachey] ok.. how do you respond to him? how do they?
  [peachey] who has the whois that says rad in it?
->[peachey] what?
->[peachey] I don't know what you mean..
  [peachey] he just called and woke up everbody
->[peachey] when, just now?
  [peachey] yes
  [peachey] just now
->[peachey] i will get him to quit in a few minutes.
  [peachey] woke up everybody
->[peachey] what did he say, and what did you say?
  [peachey] i said nothing
  [peachey] he called my brother moron or soething and woke him up
  [peachey] everyone is yelling at me
->[peachey] tell them you can't help it, and that you are trying to get him
            to stop
  [peachey] but this has been for over 2 months
->[peachey] that long?!
->[peachey] last i heard about lasted a little over 3 years
->[peachey] i am about to talk to him. I will do everything i can to have
            him not do anything else for the rest of the night.
  [peachey] i cant sleep anymore
  [peachey] my brother goes to work at 4 am and he just woke him up
->[peachey] try to get some rest.. i will try to take care of it.
->[peachey] I feel sorry for you....
  [peachey] i didnt get it on time

->[peachey] ok.. i gotta take off for a bit, but will be talking to him. i
            will try to find out whats up
->[peachey] take care
  [peachey] i probably deserve this he gets me so upset and i lose my temper
  [peachey] k
->[peachey] there?
  [peachey] yes
->[peachey] he won't bother you for the rest of the night
  [peachey] why what did he say?
->[peachey] i told him it was really uncool and that you seemed a decent
            person. told him to lay off and let you get some rest.. as a
            favor to me. he said ok
  [peachey] thank you..
->[peachey] no prob
->[peachey] if he bothers you, let me know. i will kick his ass.
  [peachey] really?
->[peachey] hmm.. well, from here on for the rest of the night he shouldn't
            bother you.
->[peachey] sorry, it was the quickest I could meet with him.
  [peachey] in person?
->[peachey] yup
->[peachey] just had him meet me down the road at Denny's
->[peachey] meetings like that are always best in person. it lets them know
            you are serious.
->[el_jefe] haha.. this is getting good.
  [peachey] can you make him stop for ever?
  [el_jefe] peachey?
->[peachey] I dunno. I can try though
->[el_jefe] yup
  [peachey] whats wrong with him?
->[peachey] I dunno. he thinks the whole thing is funny or something.
->[peachey] that costs a lot of money (at least, if you want it to be
            effective)
->[el_jefe] hahhaa.. she is talking about hiring someone to show up at your
            house!
  [el_jefe] i hope i get my ass kicked
  [peachey] worth it  i cant sleep because of him
->[peachey] i know what you mean.. but that is a serious step.
  [peachey] well he must stop
->[peachey] i know. like i said, doing what I can.
->[peachey] he is on right now
  [peachey] i know you are great..believe me i appreciate you very much
->[el_jefe] remember, no harassing..
->[el_jefe] she is really really trusting me
  [el_jefe] no prob, it's worth it :)
->[el_jefe] hehe.. i told her you were on.. so she will see no harassment and
            trust more. muhahaha
  [el_jefe] poor peachey :)
->[peachey] he harassing you right now?
  [el_jefe] when I'm the king of evil, you can be my second in command
  [peachey] yes
->[el_jefe] hehe.. i am your publicity rep/social manager
->[el_jefe] she says you are harssing her right now...
  [peachey] oh mayb its one of his followers
  [el_jefe] i'm not
  [peachey] sorry
->[peachey] it shouldn't be him..
  [peachey] wait
  [el_jefe] haven't said a word to her
->[el_jefe] oh maybe its one of his followers
  [el_jefe] maybe she means when i calledfrom the payphone at albertsons
->[el_jefe] nope... talking right now
->[peachey] he insists it isn't him.

  [el_jefe] hahahah, 10k of her
  [el_jefe] you rule
->[el_jefe]-) :)

RBCP makes a noble move to help Peachey:
---------------------------------------
"Phelon" is actually RBCP here on a day that RBCP felt like impersonating him
to cause trouble. He was actually really going to help her out with her
problems but she screwed it up.

<peachey> never call me again
 <phelon> i won't, but i need you to know that i love you
 <phelon> hello?
 <phelon> listen, i want to help you bring down el_jefe and the PLA
<peachey> you called me and i`m in lots of trouble now
<peachey> please never call me again
 <phelon> seriuosly, if you want to call me i'd gladly give you my number
 <phelon> you type too slow. forget it
 <phelon> peachey, are you there? if you are, please respond, i have 
          something to say to you. (and it's not mean)
<peachey> yes
 <phelon> okay, listen - first of all, i'm not phelon, i'm RBCP. 
          (look at the whois stuff)
<peachey> what?
 <phelon> secondly, i was going to tell you this stuff at first but you were
          mean so i was mean back at you
<peachey> whats your point?
 <phelon> I've never called you at home except for that cellular call i just
          did. The trace is not going to help and you won't catch el_jefe. I
          promise you this. I'm trying to help you here
 <phelon> el_jefe knows how to cover his tracks. the FBI couldn't even trace
          him. if you want some advice, CHANGE YOUR NICK. change it to
          peachey- or something
<peachey> you mean that was you? 
 <phelon> when you get a call at home - HANG UP. don't say one word to them.
          don't try to outsmart the caller. don't listen to what they have to
          say, just hang up. i assure you they'll get bored if you do this.
<peachey> well eljefe has stopped calling me
<peachey> hey you called
 <phelon> okay, well i seriously don't know who's calling you. i know that
          el_jefe was but whoever still is, is smart enough to cover their
          tracks so i doubt a trace will get anywhere. i'm all for bugging
          people on IRC but i think they're taking it too far
 <phelon> my web page is a compilation of humorous things on IRC. Sorry, but
          this whole thing I find humorous. :) Just change your nick and you
          won't show up on their (and my) notify.
<peachey> why are you still saying your phelon? and why did you act 
          like that on the phone
 <phelon> I hate phelon so I'm stealing his nick. i did the same thing to
          dazen last month. i'll probably keep phelon's nick for weeks. but I
          am RBCP, just look at the bright.net domain name
 <phelon> and just to assure you, i won't print this private log since it's
          mostly me giving you advice. i just think the whole thing is outta
          hand since you didn't really do anything except threaten to "get us"
<peachey> but why  did you call me? if i change the nick you still called me
<peachey> why did you call me tonight? and make my whole family upset?
 <phelon> i know i called you just now. that's the first time i ever called
          you. el_jefe spit out the number, my cell phone was here and one
          thing led to another. I pranked you. I'm just trying to tell you how
          you can avoid all this. I've fucked with alot of people before but
          they were usually more deserving than you. They're just messing
          with you because you're fun to mess with.
<peachey> thats not fair
<peachey> thanks'
 <phelon> life isn't fair. i'm a really good friend of el_jefe's and we mess
          with people alot. I'm just being nice now and telling you how to
          put a stop to it. just quit responding to them.
 <phelon> and a nick change will do you lots of good. Just a peachey- 
          or something to throw them off a little.
<peachey> but please help me
<peachey> ok
<peachey> but the phone is being traced...i didnt want to do it 
          ...i told eljefe that but you called too many times
<peachey> why did you act like that on the phone?
 <phelon> believe me, the phone company and police will assure you they're
          doing everything they can but they can't help too much. especially
          if it's el_jefe - you will NOT catch him.
 <phelon> you really should read all the PLA issues. it's good information
          and you'll realize how useless "phone traps" really are. and you'll
          read stories of other people who have gone through what you've gone
          through. i acted like that tonight because i was pranking you.
          sorry, but it was fun.
<peachey> are you planning to do itagain? it`s not fun..i`m in lots of trouble
<peachey> did you switch nicks with phelon?
 <phelon> he's taken mine to try and get to me. little does he know
          that i don't care
<peachey> but you have the same whois?
<peachey> please tell me you will never call me again
<peachey> i dont want to be enimies?
<peachey> eljefe has not called  ....so it`s just you doing it.....
 <phelon> I'M not doing it. I'm messing with you on IRC, that's all. i won't
          prank you again, though but as far as everyone else goes, i can't
          influence them either way. i'm not trying to make friends with you,
          i just think you should learn how to handle it
<peachey> why ?
<peachey> why were you mean to the operator?
 <phelon> we don't have the same  /whois. i'm bright.net and he's umn.edu.
<peachey> oh ic
 <phelon> Peachey - I PRANKED YOU. I did it for fun. That's the first and
          last time. I'm just letting you know how to take care of them. I
          don't even know who all is involved besides el_jefe. Just ignore
          them. Put them on ignore (/ignore el_jefe), don't listen or talk to
          them on the phone and change your nick. that's all it takes.
<peachey> but he calls on the phone? i can handle theirc most times but i
          have no control with the phone  thats why i`m in trouble
<peachey> eljefe is your friend?
 <phelon> yes, best friends. (sort of)
<peachey> i`m afraid to sleep now  
<peachey> please never call me again...i`ll call you if you eant
<peachey> want
<peachey> tell me why you were like that to the operator? 
<peachey> and dosent it cost you$$$$ to call from ohio?
<peachey> whos number did you give me?
 <phelon> because i was pranking you. Don't be afraid to sleep, nobody is
          going to come to your house. el_jefe is a little punk and has alot
          of free time on his hands. just take the phone off the hook if you
          have to and instruct your parents not to talk to anyone who calls
          like that. even a cellular operator because i listened to the whole
          dialouge. just hang up. and no, it doesn't cost me a dime to call
          anywhere in the world. I'm a phone loser. :) read the texts. (My
          PLAT&T long distance plan rules)
<peachey> my netscape freezes i cant read the web page..
<peachey> i cant take the phone off the hook!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 <phelon> hmmm. can you ftp?
<peachey> we use the phone for emergency calls.........i told you that
 <phelon> you should talk to concentric about that.
<peachey> what is ftp?
 <phelon> well, if you can't take the phone off the hook, don't talk to them
          when they call. don't say anything. the only reason they're calling
          is to hear you get all upset at them. and whatever you do, don't
          threaten to "get them." we really like that.
<peachey> please tell me why you scared me?
<peachey> like saying things about killing my dog
 <phelon> because i was pranking you. i'm MEAN. i'm a jerk and i like it.
<peachey> i just dont understand why you wanted to hurt me?
 <phelon> i don't want to hurt you and i didn't imply that i would hurt you. 
          i don't feel sorry for you and i'm not trying to be your friend.
          i'm just trying to help a little. dern it. how old are you? 
<peachey> not old enough to handle you
 <phelon> hehe
 <phelon> you're friends with quinus, aren't you? i know he stopped hanging 
          out in #rock because they wouldn't quit on you
*** rbcp (phelon@x212-43.stu.umn.edu) invites you to join #rock
<peachey> i did everything you told me to do the last time and you said you 
          would stop..
<peachey> quinbus dosent talk to me anymore
<peachey> he is a nice person 
 <phelon> yep, me and him are good friends. he actually took his #rock page 
          down because of you
<peachey> well i`m so sorry about that  he is so cool and regret losing 
          him.. but he dodnt belive me that el and i quess you were still
          calling me
<peachey> he is too nice yo be friends in rock he has class.
 <phelon> Other than tonight, I've never called you. Ever.I'm rbcp!remember???
<peachey> yeah sure
 <phelon> listen it really pisses me off that i'm going to this much trouble 
          to try and help you and you're calling me a liar now.
<peachey> did you call earlier today? like 5?
<peachey> nooo
<peachey> sorry please i`m sorry

<peachey> please dont get mad
<peachey> it scares me
 <phelon> i know you're paranoid from all this. but believe me - i've never 
          called you except for an hour ago
<peachey> can you give me your tel #? and eljefe?
<peachey> ok
 <phelon> no, because el_jefe is my friend and i wouldn't do that to a 
          friend. i was going to give you mine earlier but since we've had
          this chat there's not much need to now
<peachey> did you give it to me before?
 <phelon> no, i made up the last four digits.
<peachey> 419 586 that?
<peachey> why?
<peachey> i wont harrass you!
<peachey> i will call you tom
<peachey> give me a time
 <phelon> i'm not worried about you harassing me but since we've talked 
          there's no need for you to have my number now.
<peachey> yes 
<peachey> i want it i`d feel safer if i had it
 <phelon> well, too bad.
<peachey> you are mean
 <phelon> i'm mean?
<peachey> you have MY #
 <phelon> actually, i don't have your number. i punched it into the cellular 
          from the computer screen without writing it down. quit acting like
          a 5 year old
<peachey> give me yours? or el? i wont use it without your permission
 <phelon> peachey, fuck off. i've tried to be nice and i thought you'd really
          appreciate this but i guess not. go to my page and get my phone
          number if you want it so bad
<peachey> my netscape freezez
 <phelon> too bad then. fix it
<peachey> you really do hate me
 <phelon> you know, you're really stupid. i just spent an hour talking to you,
          trying to help you out and now you're giving me shit. i could've
          been a good allie of yours - someone to come to for help when
          el_jefe gives you shit but now you're just pumping me for his info.
          that's really fucking stupid on your part. good luck, you won't
          catch these people.
 <phelon> now i know why they're doing this to you.
<peachey> thanks
<peachey> thanks
<peachey> i`m sorry..please don`t be mad again.. i appreciate what you did. 
          i just don`t know who to trust.everyone has lied to me before

          help. have a nice life.

Peachey begs RBCP to kill all of the internet service in Ohio:
-------------------------------------------------------------
This one takes place after peachey kicks rbcp from #peachey and rbcp says to
unban him or else.

<peachey> your unbanned
   <rbcp> you're swell
<peachey> well i unbanned you so we are cool... now leave me alone
   <rbcp> but you're swell, peachey. go look at my irc page
   <rbcp> swell swell swell
<peachey> please dont do things like that
   <rbcp> but peachey, you don't understand. you're SWELL!
<peachey> hey i unbanned you? why are you being mean?
   <rbcp> I'm not being mean, i think you're SWELL!
<peachey> you wouldnt be hurting me if you thought that
   <rbcp> god dammit, i'm not hurting you. i'm just trying to 
          compliment you by saying that you're swell!
   <rbcp> i saw your picture today and i think i'm going to 
          link it from my irc page
<peachey> whats that mean?
   <rbcp> it means that everyone who goes to my irc page and looks 
          at the irc logs of you can also see your picture.
<peachey> please dont show me or the logs please
<peachey> if you do i`ll never ever speak to you again ever!!!
   <rbcp> well, the logs are already up there and if you know 
          anything about HTML, you know that once something goes into a 
          web server, it's there forever so i can't take them away now
   <rbcp> i'm sorry
<peachey> i hate you!! Thats just not fair  I Hate you!!!!!
   <rbcp> no wait, i'm not trying to be mean. i'll take down the 
          links that go to the irc page but i can't take down the actual 
          page. it's impossible without burning down the bright.net building
   <rbcp> i was thinking it'd be cool to get some really dumb irc logs of
          el_jefe and put them up along with that picture of him you sent me.
<peachey> please thats so cruel to do what you did
   <rbcp> what do you mean, what I did?
   <rbcp> i think it's cruel what YOU did. Colleen wouldn't speak to me 
          for weeks after you talked to her.
<peachey> to use our private logs? and my picture
<peachey> i never talked to colleen?
   <rbcp> yes you did and now she's STILL pissed at me
<peachey> what do you THINK i said?
   <rbcp> but listen, i can forgive you for that. i was thinking that maybe
          me and you could get el_jefe to say some really dumb stuff and
          i could log it and we could put it up and make him look stupid
   <rbcp> and i could put his picture up on the page too
<peachey> can you take me out of the web thing?
   <rbcp> i can't but i could put a bunch of el_jefe stuff on top of your
          logs and then people probably wouldn't notice the logs of you.
<peachey> why cant you delete?
<peachey> please
   <rbcp> i can't delete anything because if I do it will wipe out my whole
          account. bright.net is a little messed up. i wouldn't be surprised
          if deleting your page didn't crash their whole Ohio system.
   <rbcp> you should get el_jefe to say something dumb for my new
          irc logs page!
<peachey> no sa
   <rbcp> no sa?
<peachey> you can delete if you really want to?
   <rbcp> well, yeah, but then i'd crash all of the internet service 
          in Ohio. It'd take them weeks to get it all up again.
<peachey> so?
   <rbcp> SO?? SO???? This is millions of people who'd lose their internet
          if i deleted the IRC page. that's MEAN.
<peachey> no it`s not  iwant you to delete it maybe then they
          will fix the thing!
   <rbcp> well, i think it's horrible that you want to deprive all those
          people out of internet service just for your own greedy self? How
          would you like it if suddenly you couldn't access your concentric
          account? no more ircing? How would YOU like it? Huh???
<peachey> sorry i`m just very upset..
   <rbcp> i'm picking up my cell phone, peachey...
<peachey> please!!!!!!! dont!!!!!!!!!!!! please stop!
   <rbcp> what? i'm just calling my mother..
<peachey> i hate you ummmmmmmm 
<peachey> arhhhhh
<peachey> i`m so afraid that someone will call i am doomed
   <rbcp> back to this colleen thing  - what did you say to her 
          to make her never speak to me again
<peachey> nothing? sorry i dont remember?
   <rbcp> well, when i came home she hit me over the head with some lunchmeat
          and said it was because of a little conversation
          she had with peachey.
<peachey> HUMM ? I DON`T KNOW?
   <rbcp> i bet you don't
   <rbcp> well thanks for ruining a pretty good relationship. she 
          tried to run over me with her bike yesterday
<peachey> i`m sorry,,, maybe someone used my nick?? eljefe does 
          stuff like that all the time
   <rbcp> have you ever tried netsex?
<peachey> NO?)
   <rbcp> well, i was thinking that maybe me and you could have
          netsex tonight
<peachey> noooo thanks   i dont want colleen to be mad at me....
          shes my friend now :)
   <rbcp> well, i think netsex is the least you could do for me 
          since she won't talk to me anymore because of you. don't worry, 
          she's not home right now anyway
<peachey> nope friends don`t netsex with friends boyfriends!!!!
   <rbcp> well, okay, i'll give you a choice: netsex me right now 
          or i'll start calling your house all night until colleen gets home
<peachey> i guess i should have nerver talked to you
   <rbcp> come on, just 10 minutes of netsex is long enough for me...or
          should i run out to the car and fetch my cell phone?
<peachey> please dont do this it`s late and i`m upset  have a heart please
   <rbcp> then start netsexing me, darn it
<peachey> no
   <rbcp> please?
* rbcp runs out to get his cell phone...
<peachey> no thanks   hey eljefe likes to
<peachey> ummmmm we are waiting for a call please don`t  thats 
          the truth i swear
<peachey> i have to go bye
   <rbcp> okay, seriously, i gotta go now. i'm going to go turn this little
          chat into a new page for my peachey collection for everyone to see
   <rbcp> i'll talk to you when i'm done
