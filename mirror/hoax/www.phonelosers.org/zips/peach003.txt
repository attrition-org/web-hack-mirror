Welcome to the third issue of Peachey Incorporated! Not a whole lot has
developed since the last couple of issues. Peachey has finally started coming
back on IRC on a regular basis. Somehow she managed to find someone who gave
her el_jefe's real home phone number and when the #rock goons found out about
this, they really let her have it. By now she's wishing she'd never gotten it
and refuses to tell anyone who gave it to her. Details are in the #phoneloser
log in this issue.

Darkhour (a regular from #rock) was nice enough to make a peachey.irc script.
It doesn't actually do anything useful but blurt out dumb peachey quotes but
it's funny. Also, check out peachmap.jpg which should be included in this
issue's archive and shows pictures of peachey's town and a map to her house!

As a regular feature in each issue of Peachey Inc, we will dedicate a section
to peachey's personal information, updated from the last issue to reflect
changes if any apply. Nobody has really done any research lately so we don't
have alot of information but here's the little that we do have:

Peachey lives at 16 Cornell in Marblehead, MA which is a suburb-like town of
Boston, MA. She lives with her brother, mom & dad. Their main phone number is
617-639-0224. They also have at least one other line which we haven't got yet
because the MLAC offices are really fierce there. On their video account at
Videoscope, they list Beverly, Zac & Zeb Edwards. We believe peachey's real
name is Ashley and she's 27 years old but haven't really bothered to verify
any of this info.

Listed with directory assistance is Zac & Zeb Edwards, 288 Pleasant St,
Marblehead, MA, 617-631-8454. This residence is very close by peachey's house.
(see map) The Marblehead MLAC number is 617-662-3550 if anyone wants to give
it a try. They insist that I give them a tech ID number.

If you see peachey, warn her not to rent any videos! An unnamed person called
the video store, explaining they were Chris Tomkinson of the Boston Police
Department and that if any of the Edwards family came in to rent videos, to
remain calm and call the police immediately. The video store clerk made a
notation on their account and promised to keep her eye out for them. hehe.

They are bad honest:
-------------------
Note: sad is peachey, just trying to trick us into thinking she's not on IRC.

   <sad> why do you call yourself Roy? are you roy?
<Maq702> Yeah, I'm Roy.  Why?
   <sad> is that eljefes name? are you also in rock?
<Maq702> It's my name, and it's also el_jefe's name.  Just a coincidence.
   <sad> thanks you  what is eljefe name? it`s not roy
<Maq702> His first name is Roy, I donno his last. He talked to me when 
         I first came into #rock, cause he saw my name and noticed it's the 
         same as his.
   <sad> be carful in rock they are bad people
<Maq702> They are?  They seem nice...  I just came in the other day cause a
         friend of mine said that write a wagazine he likes.   They say they
         don't do it anymore, but oh well.  We just talk about computers and
         stuff.  Why do you say they're bad?
   <sad> they harrass me
<Maq702> They do?  How?
<Maq702> How can they harass you on IRC?
   <sad> too numerous to mention  are you male?
<Maq702> Yeah...   are you?
   <sad> no  if you can find out what eljefe name is  but do not under any
         circumstances tell him you talk to me!!
<Maq702> Ok...     I won't.  I haven't talked to him except that first night.
<Maq702> You're a girl and they harass you?  That's messed up...
<Maq702> Did you do something to them?
   <sad> please try for me...they call me at my home all hours swear threaten
         me etc it`s a nightmare please dont tell them you talking to me
<Maq702> Geez, really?  How did they get your phone number?
   <sad> no i didn`t do anything to make them this mad at me :(
<Maq702> I won't say anything for now...  if they're really doing this to
         you I'm not gonna talk to them any more.
   <sad> they tricked me in \to giving it
<Maq702> But I hope you're not telling stories about them...
<Maq702> You aren't, are you?
   <sad> they have my unlisted phone number. i got it changed and they got
         the new one..they are phone losers of america
<Maq702> Geez...  like PLA?  That's the name of the magazine my friend said
         these guys wrote or are writing or whatever.
   <sad> they are bad honest  be carful
<Maq702> I didn't know what it stood for, I never read it...  my friend 
         doesn't have a computer anymore, but he said to check out #rock.
<Maq702> I will....  crap.  Are you sure you didn't do anything to them?
         I mean, they really seem nice...
   <sad> get out while you can  and never ever give your telephone number
<Maq702> How did they get your new phone number? (if it's unlisted)
<Maq702> Crap...  I already gave my number to one guy!
   <sad> they tricked me :(
<Maq702> Damn.
<Maq702> I mean, c'mon...    There has to be some reason why they call you
         at home! You didn't like swear at them or insult them or anything?
   <sad> they are harrassing me big time
<Maq702> How'd they get your new number?
   <sad> i dont know?
<Maq702> Are they like hackers or something?
   <sad> yes
<Maq702> Geez.  Can't you call the cops? If they're harassing you...
   <sad> they cant catch them
<Maq702> Sure they can!  They can trace the calls or something...
   <sad> they have been traced...dosen`t work they are using cellular
         and phone booths
<Maq702> That sucks.  Can't you change the number again?  And like be 
         really careful with it?
   <sad> i did they have access to all the phones somehow even unlisted
<Maq702> Geez.  Are you sure you didn't do anything to them?  I mean, 
         they wouldn't harass you for no reason?!
   <sad> NO
<Maq702> Why would they spent so much time bugging you then?
* session ends. guess she logged off.

         dad fired and or arrested.  He's lose his job and his 
         medical license.
<el_jefe> you remember everything the person said but you don't 
          remember who said it
<pabell> if your going to throw them away why the fuck log it?
<Sc0rp> peachey: LISTEN DO U WANT YOUR DAD TO LOOSE HIS JOB?
<Maq702> Is that worth it to you, to have your whole family's 
         life destroyed?
<peachey> yes
<pinguino> youre an insensitive bitch then
<Sc0rp> I would hate for your dad to loose his job
<Sc0rp> that would prob NOT be cool
<peachey> no i dont remember the nick  why can t you understand it?
<pabell> LIAR
<el_jefe> you thought your life was hell before, that's 
          nothing. It was just a game til now.
<el_jefe> liar
<peachey> why?
<el_jefe> you expect us to believe you remember everything the 
          person said, but not who it was?
<el_jefe> bullshit
<Sc0rp> peacheY: How bout I have a investigation started on your dad?
<YAM_NINJA> would jog cuntie's memory
<Sc0rp> U think he would like that?
<Maq702> You think some phone calls were annoying?!?   That is 
         nothing compard to what's coming now!
<pinguino> peachey, ever thought about college? haha. not gonna happen now.
<el_jefe> your life, your parents lives, your friends lives (if 
          you have any left)
<el_jefe> all over with
<Sc0rp> your poor daddy is gonna be collecting state aid
<S_P> my brother keeps bothering me about what college to go to
<Sc0rp> no more puter for u
<el_jefe> unless you start talking
<S_P> (he's doing that right now)
<YAM_NINJA> (what he said).
<Maq702> Hmm, let's see...    just slip a quarter gram of cocaine in
         your dad's car, phone in an anonymous tip to the police...
<Sc0rp> maq: no u forget 
<Sc0rp> maq: I can have a investigation started on ANYONE
<Sc0rp> power is nice
<Maq702> Boom...    arrested.  Loss of medical license for drug 
         use.  Fired and ignored by his friends.
<Sc0rp> even if there was nothing there
<Sc0rp> he still would be seen as a bad person
<Sc0rp> stigmatizing him forever
<pinguino> wait. if peacheys so old why does she still live 
           with her parents?!!?
<rbcp> she's retarded that's why
* S_P 's dad is a doctor
<Sc0rp> WAIT
<Maq702> All of a sudden you have to move cuz the bank 
         forecloses on your house.  Parents start fighting over money 
         every day until they ultimately divorce.
<Sc0rp> I remember now
<el_jefe> i suggest you answer the question
<Sc0rp> your dad was molesting some kid
<el_jefe> peachey

        [rbcp joins #peachey and gets kicked.]

   <rbcp> that's fine. we'll see who does the kicking tonight


-------------------
This is actually rbcp and not Colleen.

<ColleenC> they let you in #rock?
 <peachey> are you okay??? rbcpsaid he beat you  :(
 <peachey> can you leave him??
 <peachey> bring the baby and come to boston
 <peachey> and dont tell him
<ColleenC> hehe. he doesn't beat me
<ColleenC> did he say he did?
 <peachey> yes he did:(   i have been very upset about it all day
<ColleenC> oh! well he didn't do anything like that. rbcp is a very
           non-violent person. i could kick his ass. hehe.
 <peachey> well kick it  he said horrible things about what he did to you
<ColleenC> hmmmm. are you sure it was rbcp? he promised me he wouldn't do 
           anything like that to you anymore.
 <peachey> it was him all the time calling me at night early am threateining 
           me it was him  :)  i am sorry to tell you this
<ColleenC> no no no, rbcp would never do anything like that to you. he has 
           no way to call for free. i've taken away his red box and calling
           cards. it's impossible
 <peachey> colleen if youever have a problem   you cancome to me with the 
           baby  honest  you are a very sweet girl and do not deserve his
           double personality  please becarfu;
 <peachey> colleen it was him :(  he said it today  he verified things to me 
           that ONLY he would know  iM positive
<ColleenC> hmmm. he just left for work. i'll have to have a talk with him. 
           but he doesn't hit me, he's a very nice person. everyone likes
           him here.
 <peachey> well i`m telling you honestly  it was him that was calling me  he 
           proved it to me...just becarful  it`s not a joke please colleen
           just be carful
<ColleenC> okay well thank you. but really he's a very nice person and I 
           don't think he would do something awful like that.
<ColleenC> well, there was that one time he punched my teeth in. but other 
           than that...
 <peachey> what?????????????????????????????????
 <peachey> colleen????????????????????? do you know what your saying?
 <peachey> you are kidding?
<ColleenC> no, i wouldn't kid about something like that.
<ColleenC> he's a nice guy but when he drinks too much kool-aid he gets a 
           little hyperactive. this was just one of those times
 <peachey> colleen you are too nice for him  dont be offended i dont want 
           your marriage upset  but you shoul leave him immediately  go
           home to your mom
<ColleenC> ack, no way. my mom is a meaney. alex is really nice he just 
           gets a little obsessed over dumb things.
<ColleenC> like once i didn't fold his underwear like he wanted me too so 
           he shredded all my underwear into little peices and threw them
           in the street. but this was early in our marriage so it was
           understandable.
 <peachey> no no   no  thats not true  no man scares woman ever?
 <peachey> colleen look i wont 
 <peachey> and i do not mean to upset you  please just listen to me  if he 
           hits you or threatens you   take emily and leave without him
           knowing and go to the shelter..or call me okay?  at least you
           have a place to go  okay?? you dont have to be abused by him 
<ColleenC> i'm not abused though! he's really nice when he's sober which is 
           most of the weekdays.
 <peachey> he f drinks liquor too???????????? god
 <peachey> colleen :(
 <peachey> arnt you scared?
<ColleenC> well, it's not so bad. he's really nice and the only real problem
           with the liquor is that he buys so much of it that i never have
           money for emily's food. but i don't mind his drinking.
 <peachey> god this is obsurb... sorry but i hste him
 <peachey> brb door bell
<ColleenC> but he's NICE. you'd like him if you met him in person. he's cool

        [As usual, I'm posting our private chat for everyone
         to see in #rock]

<ColleenC> i don't care if you do. go ahead and ignore me. you can't ignore 
           my phone calls.
 <peachey> nope
 <peachey> hey i just want you to be a little kinder towards me
<ColleenC> then don't try to threaten and insult me. see, that's why you're 
           in the situation that you're in.

          you should know - apok0lyps and el_jefe and a bunch of other
          people have already set up flights to boston for next week. so i'd
