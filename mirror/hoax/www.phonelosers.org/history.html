<center><h1>WHAT IS THE PLA?</h1></center>
<center><h6>Last updated on September 5th, 1998</h6></center>

PLA stands for Phone Losers of America. If you hadn't figured that out yet then you are a very slow person. PLA was originally an electronic magazine created back in late 1994 and dealing with the usual underground topics of phone phreaking, a little computer hacking, getting stuff for free and learning things that you're not supposed to. We also specialized in making everything humorous and fun to read since at the time that was very hard to come by in the H/P world.<p>

The magazine is no longer published and never will be again. The editor, RBCP, decided he was tired of writing it and wanted to pursue other things such as a life. (Sell out) We've also released two prank phone call tapes which are sold on our page along with other miscellaneous PLA t-shirts & caps, hoping to get filthy rich someday but actually only barely breaking even.<p>

Despite the .ORG extension in our domain, PLA has never been any kind of an organization or a group. It was only a zine, nothing more, and still we are bombarded with e-mail from people, asking us how they can join the PLA, even go so far as to list references and skillz they possess. Dont do this - PLA is not a group. (There that should reduce my e-mail by .01%)<p>

Now we just maintain the site as a hobby, promoting our stupid little projects and providing entertainment to hapless web surfers. We've also been encouraging people to make their own PLA web sites which list local contact information for H/P scenes and help phreaks to meet other phreaks in their area.

<center><h3>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PLA</h3></center>


This is just sort of a history of the PLA. You know, where it's been and where it'll never go, that kind of thing. Contrary to popular belief, I am not the founder of the PLA - Zak (el_jefe) is. In September & October of 1994 I started getting really bored so I would take my laptop computer to the Portland, Oregon airport every day and do alot of bbsing all morning while Colleen Card was at school. Zak, posting alot of nonsense everywhere, as usual, wrote somewhere, "Well, I'm going to start a really cool hacker group and I'm going to call us the Phone Losers of America." <p>

A few months later, around November 28th, I left Colleen and moved to Austin, Texas to get an apartment and a job and go to HoHoCon. (I bet I was the only one there that actually <em>moved</em> to Austin just to attend HoHoCon.) I had some extra money and I was bored so I went to a printshop on Third Street and had them print up 1000 business cards that said, "Phone Losers of America" on them. When Zak arrived in Austin, we had a lot of fun handing these cards to complete strangers, throwing them around restaurants, licking them and slapping them on storefront windows in downtown and leaving them sitting everywhere around the Ramada Inn during HoHoCon.<p>

After HoHoCon, I didn't have anything better to do so I decided that since I hadn't visited my parents in about two years, I'd book a flight to Illinois and go see them. I stayed there a <em>month</em> and just about went insane out of boredom. During that time I took alot of my old text files that I'd written back in high school and put new Phone Losers headers and footers on them and released them all as PLA files and uploaded them to a few bbses. This is where PLA001 through PLA013 all came from.<p>

Just a day or two after that, the whole Dino Allsman incident happened and the next day I wrote PLA014 which details all the Dino events. Finally, I left Illinois and took an Amtrack back to Austin. I ended up spending the next night in Austin's airport and since I'd slept in Austin's airport for many days in the previous month, the security lady said if I fell asleep in the airport that night, she'd throw me out. So I whipped out the laptop to stay awake and that's when PLA015 (the one about beige boxing) was written.<p>

The next day I took a smelly Greyhound Bus to Corpus Christi, Texas, got an apartment and started running a bbs called Whombat Communications. This is where the rest of the PLA issues 016 - 034 were written. By issue 021, Colleen Card had moved to Corpus Christi with me and we ended up meeting Nova Storm/Monster Magnet, H00ters and Calimar. Everyone in that town who didn't know us seemed to fear the PLA and the local internet provider hired an investigator on us and told everyone he met that it would be his personal mission to bring us down. What a weirdo.<p>

During our last 6 months there, I really got into bbsing and started calling BBSes all over the world, uploading PLA issues everywhere and begging the sysops to create a directory for my stuff. After living there for almost a year, we decided Corpus sucked so we took a vacation to Illinois and stayed for a week. Zak & Company were nice enough to rent out a hotel room and throw a party for us. I shudder at the memory of meeting Nekid Amy in person. (Important Note: Cheap motel Bible pages do <em>not</em> make good rolling papers.<p>

While spending our week in Illinois, the Belleville News Democrat did two front page stories on the PLA and one editorial. After the first front page story came out, I copied it and released PLA035. The day we left Illinois, the police and Madison County authorities came with my arrest warrant. After finding they'd missed me, they went to the St. Louis airport hoping to find me there. Hehe, suckers.<p>

We flew to Portland, Oregon and got a ride down to Albany, Oregon to live. Big mistake. Albany is like a Jeff Foxworthy theme park. Big shiney belt buckles, monster trucks and CB Radios prevail. Some of our roommates passed their weekends by taking their monster truck to a mud pit and driving around with the other trucks. They also liked to play CB tag where you drive around town and figure out where the guy who's "it" is broadcasting from.<p>

When we arrived there I set up the Whombat Communications BBS again and released PLA036 just so I could advertise the BBS. About a month later, I got an account on a local internet provider called blitzinfo.com, set up a web page called Whombat Communications and took the BBS down forever.<p>

About this time, Zak and Apok0lyps had pooled their money to start a new business in Granite City, Illinois called RoyCo. They rented out a building and started selling computer systems and eventually set up an internet provider called spiff.net. Since blitzinfo.com was only up about 10 hours a day (a bunch of idiot teenagers ran it) I moved Whombat Communications to spiff.net and creatively named it the Phone Losers of America Web Page.<p>

Months later Zak, Apok0lyps and Dazen moved to Corpus Christi, Texas, shutting down RoyCo and leaving spiff.net in the hands of a guy who doesn't know much about computers. Eventually he terminated my account and I moved the PLA web page to peak.org where it currently resided for over a year. During our stay in Albany, we released PLA037 - PLA041.<p>

We lasted in Albany for over a year, then packed up the car, rented a U-Haul and drove to Celina, Ohio making a short pitstop in Illinois as usual. Most of PLA042 was written during our stop in Illinois and the rest of it was relased in Celina along with PLA043 through PLA046. Issue 46 marked the end of the 'zine forever and a deep sense of loss settled over the entire
country.  Unemployment is high, T.V. ratings are down, stocks are plummeting and the phone company executives are much much happier.<p>

And that's the history. Not much, but sure beats reading a Dr. Suess book, eh? I will soon get to updating the indepth looks below but don't hold your breath.<p>

<center><h2>An Indepth Look at Each Issue</h2></center>

<b>PLA001 </b>How to hack a WWIV bbs. During my sophomore year in high school, Chris Tomkinson (yes, <i>Chris Tomkinson</i>) taught me a trick that someone else had taught him to get into a WWIV bbs's DOS prompt. (And there were about 20-30 WWIV bbses to choose from in that area. Man, 618 sucked.) Anyway, it involved extrapolating the COMMAND.COM file, causing an error and giving you a DOS prompt. We stayed up a few nights in a row, getting into kid's computers and nosing around. After awhile, we couldn't resist and we started changing things around on their bbses, such as their logon screens (Welcome to the 618 Gay Support BBS!), downloading their USER.DAT files (giving us everyone's passwords) and adding news subs for people to post on. After a few months it got really out of hand and people were wanting to lynch us. (Security leak, everyone figured out that it was us.) A few months after that, I started getting mail from all these people begging me to teach them how to hack WWIV bbses. Sick of it, I wrote this file just to annoy them.<p>

<b>PLA002 </b>How To Build A Red Box. I'd been red boxing for about a year, using a portable tape recorder. One night some friends took me to some guy's house in Belleville, IL and this guy was impressed to see that red boxing still worked. He showed me an issue of 2600 that had the article on how to turn a tone dialer into a red box and asked me if I could build one for him. I did, and so I copied the 2600 article into PLA002. Over the years, I've added new techniques as I've learned about them<p>

<b>PLA003 </b>Getting Revenge. Originally, the name of the person being tortured in this file was Darin McCall, someone me & Chris Tomkinson used to pick on for being lame. By the time this became a PLA file, Chris had pissed me off so I redid the whole thing using Chris's name.<p>

<b>PLA004 - PLA006 </b>These three files were written in the 24 hour computer lab at IUPUI, the local college in Indianapolis, Indiana. I usually spent every night there because I  was homeless and it was cold outside.<p>

<b>PLA007 </b>Numbers to Call When You're Bored. This originally was titled FUNNUMBS.TXT. I uploaded it to Ripco BBS, accidentally lost my copy and forgot I wrote it. Almost a year later, I logged on to Ripco and saw it there, downloaded it, updated it and turned it into a PLA file. Since numbers change all the time and new ones turn up, I created the PLA Phone Directory, which is the same thing only bigger and released quarterly.</p>

<b>PLA008 </b>Ruining The Life Of A 7-Eleven Employee. Most of this was actually written while working at a 7-Eleven in Portland, Oregon. Having nothing better to do at night (hell, I'm not going to do any actual <i>work!</i>), I would bring my laptop and one night started compiling a list of things customers did to piss me off. Then I started adding things that they <i>could </i>do. Then I just started making things up. (You'll see the pattern there.) <p>

<b>PLA009 </b>The Jim Bayless Playwrite. Colleen Card wrote this around October 1994 for a school project. The whole thing was acted out in front of a class by her and some classmates.<p>

<b>PLA010 </b>Scanner Frequencies. I was trying to compile a list of scanner frequencies and in hopes that maybe someone would mail me some more interesting ones, I published this. It didn't work, dammit.<p>

<b>PLA011 </b>Phone Losers Fone Call Transcripts. Most of these transcripts are transcribed directly from cassette tape and the others are done from memory. <p>

<b>PLA012 </b>Converting Your 2400 Baud Modem To 14.4. After successfully pulling off this scam twice at a local Wal-Mart, I had to brag about it to everyone so I wrote this file.<p>

<b>PLA013 </b>Fone Tricks & Petty Scams. This is another one written in the IUPUI computer lab over a period of a few weeks. I was trying to compile a big phreak guide out of all the cool texts files I could find and I wrote this section as a part of the guide. Later I scraped the whole idea but kept this file and turned it into this PLA file a few years later.<p>

<b>PLA014 </b>Cordless Phone Hell. This all happened while visiting my parents. Every word of it is true. The day after the whole event happened and I was sure that Dino wasn't going to come over and blow my head off with his 12 guage, I wrote this file from the tapes I had recorded, from memory and with Zak's help over the phone.<p>

<b>PLA015 </b>Taking Beige Boxing To The Ultimate Limit. I wrote this one in the Austin, Texas airport one night when I couldn't sleep. (I lived there for a few days after visiting my parents.) Of course nothing in the story is true other than the fact that I really did live in Celina, Ohio for a few months.<p>

<b>PLA016 </b>Deaf Fones, Phone Books & Phone Bills. I kept bugging the hell out of Zak to write something for PLA. After weeks of pestering him, he finally e-mailed this issue to me and told me to leave him the hell alone.<p>

<b>PLA017 </b>Letters From The Phone Company. I was going through all my papers and found a shitload of phone company letters addressed to me, mostly demanding their money. At the time it seemed funny so I typed 'em all out and released them. All of them are real except for the one obvious one.<p>

<b>PLA018 </b>Kevin Mitnick Articles. I'd been a big Mitnick fan since I read Cyberpunk so I started collecting all the newpaper articles and text files I could find on him. <p>

<b>PLA019 </b>Fun With Call Forwarding. This was rewritten in Corpus Christi. It's an old file of mine (written in high school, I think) that I found so I updated it and released it.<p>

<b>PLA020 </b>Alternatives To CN/A. This is another old file I wrote during high school.<p>

<b>PLA021 </b>I started getting really annoyed with e-mail asking me how they could join the PLA so I wrote out this bogus application form in hopes of sending the message, "Hello? It's a text file, not a club?" Unfortunately, that didn't work and I still get e-mail like that.<p>

<b>PLA022 </b>BBS Back Doors & Flaws. This one was written by Pestilence, my first actual contributor. The only problem with it is that he kept mixing all the facts with jokes so I have no idea what's real and what's bullshit.<p>

<b>PLA023 </b>Long Distance Access Codes. This file has got to be the most useless one yet, but I spent so long scanning out all those access codes that I couldn't just let it sit around in a file forever. <p>

<b>PLA024 </b>Dabbling in Credit Card Fraud. I happened to be writing this file and finishing it up right around the time I got busted for credit card fraud in Corpus Christi. After I was released and awaiting trial, I thought that maybe it wouldn't be such a good idea to publish something like this and I erased the whole thing. Then, a month later, all charges against me were dropped so I figured what the hell and re-wrote it. Don't you love this country? <p>

<b>PLA025 </b>Taking Over Fred Meyers From The Comfort of Your Own Home. This was written from the experience of taking over the Fred Meyers paging systems all over Portland, Oregon. I decided to wait to release it until I moved outta Portland.<p>

<b>PLA026 </b>Detailed Information On Various Phone Offices Around The Universe. This one shouldn't have been released but I accidentally made it available for download on my bbs, so I finished it up and sent it out.<p>

<b>PLA027 </b>Nursery Rhymes For Baby Phreaks & Other Perverts. Colleen Card wrote all of these while she was living in Oregon and I was in Corpus Christi, Texas on a crappy IBM typewritter and mailed them to me to turn them into a PLA file.<p>

<b>PLA028 </b>Ordering Telephone Calling Cards. This was written in response to some guy on a local bbs asking me how to order calling cards for people.<p>

<center><h2>WEB SITE HISTORY</h2></center>

<strong>www.blitzinfo.com</strong> This was PLA's original official home. Unfortunately for us, blitzinfo was run by a bunch of teens in Albany, Oregon and was only connected to the net 50% of the day. Eventually they went out of business and shut down without warning which sucked because we'd just finished begging people all over the place to add our page to their links.<p>

<strong>www.spiff.net</strong> Originally spiff.net was run by el_jefe & some friends and they were nice enough to give me a free account for my page since blitzinfo had gone down. This only lasted a few month, though, because they turned over the ISP to some guy when they left town for Texas. He didn't like me at all and his first order of business was to remove my account without warning.<p>

<strong>www.peak.org</strong> So far, peak has been our longest lasting home. We moved the page here immediately after spiff.net closed our account and remained for about 9 months. Even after we moved to Ohio, we kept the page on peak for a few more months.<p>

<strong>www.bright.net</strong> Thinking it would be more cost-efficient to just host the site on our own local account, we moved it to bright.net only to find out a few days later that bright.net had an extremely slow web server. We were flooded with complaints that the page was taking too long to load so we moved it back over to peak.org<p>

<strong>www.cocksoldier.com</strong> The page moved to cocksoldier when Netmask saw me in #TACD talking about moving my page & offered to host it for me.<p>
