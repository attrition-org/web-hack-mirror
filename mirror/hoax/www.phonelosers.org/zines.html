Having problems finding anything good to read since PLA quit publishing? Well then this is just the page for you - a listing of other 'zines that you might be interested in reading. Hope you find something you like!<p>



<strong><a href="http://surf.to/damage_inc">Damage, Inc.</strong></a> They're really cool, I swear!<p><hr>

<strong><a href="http://www.openix.com/~mutter/">root zine</a></strong> A paper zine, dealing with the usual topics of computer security and telephone fun. Very nicely organized and put together by a very small staff. Definately worth the $2 per issue. Subscriptions can be sent to root zine, PO Box 1178, Maplewood, NJ, 07040.<p>

<strong><a href="bnf.html">Boulder News Frenzy</a></strong> This is an old, no longer printed e-zine detailing the events around the Boulder News Forum and Jonbenet Ramsey from a couple years ago when the PLA apparently invaded their forums. This zine is also listed at <a href="http://www.meer.net/~johnl/e-zine-list/zines/boulder-news-frenzy.html">John Meer's e-zine list</a>.<p><hr>

<strong>FLaK</strong> A gang of professional hard-core phreaks who aren't afraid to try anything. No, that's not what FLaK is, but I sure got your attention, didn't I? FLaK is stupid and you won't really learn too much from it, but guaranteed you'll laugh yourself to death.<p>
<hr>

<strong>Prohibited Data Processing</strong> This one's hard to describe. Either you'll love it or you won't. There's some really good, really weird stories in here, mostly somehow related to the underground. It's just funny, okay?<p>
