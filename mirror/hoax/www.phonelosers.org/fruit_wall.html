Please be responsible when posting messages to the main phonelosers.org page. All IPs are logged. HTML scripting will not be recognized. Be creative, write something cool - we get several thousand hits per day so your message does count! Occasionally I skim through the log and pick out cool/funny quotes to rotate randomly in the title bar of phonelosers.org so try to think up something cool and it might become a permanent part of the site. Do not post the personal information of yourself or others, we've had to ban the use of numbers in this form since we are liable when somebody posts access codes on our page.
