<p>In <a href="viewpla.html">PLA007</a>, we published a phone directory of interesting telephone numbers to call that were guaranteed to pass the time on a boring day. After awhile, many of these numbers were outdated and disconnected so several updates of this issue were released. In the summer of 1995, PLA decided to begin releasing quarterly phone directories, which would be updated as much as possible.<p>

We haven't exactly kept up with the quarterly plan, but today there are six phone directories, each one bigger than the previous. These directories are perfect to print up and take on beige boxing expeditions or just to flip through and call random numbers for the sheer hell of it. You'll find pay phones around the world, interesting voice mail boxes and answering machines, phone company newslines and more Roys than you can shake a stick at.<p><br>

<br>
Phone numbers are always being accepted for this directory. Most wanted are pay phones, fax-back services and phone company test lines. E-Mail your submissions to <a href="mailto:linear@phreaker.net">linear@phreaker.net</a>. As most of you know from reading the latest phone directory, the directory is now being maintained by the <a href=http://www.phonelosers.net>United Phone Losers</a>. If you're submitting something for the loser list, it will be ignored unless you also submit something useful, such as a couple pay phone numbers. <p>
