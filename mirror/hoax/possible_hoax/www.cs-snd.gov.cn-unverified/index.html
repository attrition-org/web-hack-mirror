  Hi boys and girls, it's your buddy Hex again. I'd like to start off today's little extravaganza with a message to a few of you <b>[hackers]</b>. You guys are complete fucking morons. Who declares a war against the Federal Bureau of Investigation? Your lame ideas are that because hackers got raided we're going to hack government servers and cripple the world.

<P>  Most of the FBI couldn't give less of a fuck about you and is probably annoyed that they even had to waste time raiding those lame shits who were dumb enough to get caught. You stupid queers who say this is a war of skill and the FBI can't win are just as dumb too. 
<P>  There is no war and who cares if you can root a unix operating system that a webpage runs off, wow I bet that really impresses your boyfriends. I bet some of you down's syndrome rejects actually think if you deface pages the FBI will give in, in some way. If you want to hack, deface, whatever then just do it, just don't be a bunch of lame fucking fags about it.
<P>
 Thank you. :-)</P>
