::Dv8 stands up::<BR>
Hi, My name is Dv8 and I'm addicted to crack-cocaine...oh wait, wrong place.<BR>
Hi, welcome to the official web-site of Los Angeles California. Where we take<BR>
great pride in our air that you can see with the naked eye and our police<BR>
officers who are not afraid to show defensless racial minorities who is boss.<BR>
::Dv8 sits back down::<BR>
<BR><BR>
<B><U>In Current News:</U><BR>
Today there were another bunch of earthquakes but we don't<BR>
really care anymore because they don't pay us enough to.<BR>
<BR>
Some famous celebrities were caught talking to each other<BR>
about laundry.<BR>
<BR>
There were some riots.<BR>
<BR>
Our police officers abused some racial minorities.<BR>
(We have this down to an art form)</B>
<BR><BR>
<B><U>
Now for some more serious news:</U><BR></B>
First off I would like to alert you to the news that<BR>
the senate's website (www.senate.gov) has been hacked<BR>
not once, but twice within the past few weeks, along<BR>
with the whitehouse's website (www.whitehouse.gov) a<BR>
few feeks ago. Now most of this was not told to the<BR>
general public because well...it's just not good publicity.<BR>
Alot of things have been happening on the internet lately<BR>
and about 90% of the public is completely oblivious to it.<BR>
People need to become more involved in the internet or it<BR>
is going to eat them alive. :*(<BR>
<BR>
Another thing that has been bothering me lately is a little<BR>
project called "Echelon". This project being put together by the<BR>
C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies around the world is<BR>
beginning to remind me of "1984" daily. This project is a super<BR>
intelligence "taskforce" (you could say). Fortunately people<BR>
are looking into the constitutionality of this project. But<BR>
nothing can help us better than a simple letter to a congressman<BR>
asking about what "Echelon" is, how it's going to affect you and even<BR>
asking that it be shut down right in it's tracks. Everything affects<BR>
you in the end, you must take action.<BR>
<BR>
Well, I guess owning L.A. was fun in it's own way, but who really *shrug*.<BR>
<BR>
