								A *very* inaccurate record was printed on page 178 concerning
								the case of a computer hacker named Kevin Mitnick. In fact, we
								think this single paragraph may have set a record of its own for
								the amount of mistruths in such a short space!<BR>
								<BR>
								Please read the following reproduction of the piece in question
								along with the many corrections we hope to have included in a
								future edition of the book. Please send <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@guinnessrecords.com">email</A> to voice your opinion on this issue.<BR>

								(Corrections are in brackets and coloured <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">red</FONT>.)<BR>
								<BR>
								MOST NOTORIOUS HACKER CASE<BR>
								<BR>
								<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">[Obviously this category isn't a real &quot;world record&quot; as it's completely
								subjective and open to bias. It would be like labelling somebody
								the World's Biggest Idiot when there are so many contenders, each
								with their own unique attributes. Records in this book should
								be based on cold, hard numbers and indisputable facts, not sheer
								conjecture. We sincerely regret that anything so sensationalist
								ever made it into these pages.]</FONT><BR>
								<BR>
								Hacker Kevin Mitnick is alleged to have broken into several major
								organizations' computer systems, including those of Sun Microsystems,
								Motorola, and the Pentagon. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">[Upon further research it can be revealed that there is no evidence
								anywhere to suggest that Mr. Mitnick ever had anything to do with
								Pentagon computers.]</FONT> Mitnick was arrested on September 16, 1996 <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">[Actually, that was the date he was INDICTED. Mr Mitnick was ARRESTED
								on February 15, 1995, more than four years ago! And at the time
								of this writing, he had still not been given the opportunity to
								defend himself. We would like to say that this is some sort of
								record for the United States justice system but, regrettably,
								this kind of thing happens far too often.]</FONT> after an FBI computer expert <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">[Here we can't be certain whether or not this is a factual misstatement
								since there is widespread belief that <A HREF="mailto:tsutomu@sdsc.edu">Tsutomu Shimomura</A> (the alleged superhacker who helped track down Mr. Mitnick along
								with New York Times writer <A HREF="mailto:markoff@nyt.com">John Markoff</A> and quickly went on to make a fortune writing a book called &quot;Takedown&quot;
								and later getting movie rights to the film which will be released
								in 1999 despite widespread condemnation) was actually hired by
								the government for a variety of nefarious purposes. According
								to <A HREF="mailto:postmaster@fbi.gov">Louis Freeh</A>, director of the FBI, Mr. Shimomura was an employee. According
								to Mr. Shimomura, he was not. This is the sort of thing you as
								an individual must decide on your own.]</FONT> tracked him down. He has since been charged with software theft,
								wire fraud, the interception of wire communications <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">[Whoops, here we go again. In actuality, Mr. Mitnick has never
								been charged with any such thing. But, as an interesting aside,
								if you read the Shimomura/Markoff book, you will see that they
								did exactly this in their attempt to capture Mr. Mitnick.]</FONT> and computer vandalism <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">[This one came from outer space - Mr. Mitnick has never been accused
								of anything remotely resembling vandalism. His major offense is
								alleged to be copying software (for the sake of curiosity; Mr.
								Mitnick has never been accused of trying to profit from this or
								cause harm in any way to the companies involved). Because the
								places where he copied the software from say it's worth $80 million,
								he is being treated as if he stole something worth that amount
								of money. The companies will not say how they arrived at this
								incredible figure nor do many people seem to believe that the
								software has any value whatsoever to anyone not involved in its
								development.]</FONT> Mitnick, the first hacker ever to have appeared on an FBI wanted
								poster, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">[Actually, Mr. Mitnick appeared on a wanted poster but it wasn't
								an FBI poster. He also wasn't the first hacker to show up on such
								a poster. But compared to all of the other mistruths, this one
								is hardly worth mentioning.]</FONT> faces up to 12 years in prison if he is found guilty. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">[Again, there is no basis in reality for this statement either.
								Mr. Mitnick has already been imprisoned for more than four years
								before his case has even been heard. The United States government
								has made it abundantly clear that they intend to keep him imprisoned
								for as long as they possibly can in order to send a message to
								all of the other hackers in the country. If anything, this kind
								of treatment has made the spirit of rebellion among hackers even
								stronger and has served to unite the community. When Mr. Mitnick
								does finally get his trial, he could be imprisoned for much much
								longer or he could finally be released. What it boils down to
								is that we just don't know.]</FONT><BR>

								We apologize for all of the space that was taken up by this narrative.
								However, we felt it was important for you to know the facts. Now,
								you have a choice. See the Guinness site or visit the official
								Kevin Mitnick site and learn as many facts as you can. Thanks
								for reading.<BR>
