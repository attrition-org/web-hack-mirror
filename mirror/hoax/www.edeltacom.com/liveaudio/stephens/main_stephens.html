<P>A native of Gadsden, Alabama, Carl Stephens got the bug for broadcasting at a very early age. At age 10, he was announcing one inning of every Gadsden (the old Southeastern League) baseball game. Then, on his 16th birthday, he went to work for WJBY Radio in Gadsden and worked until he entered college at the University of Alabama.

<P>Stephens graduated in 1957 and began work at WSFA-TV in Montgomery the day after his college graduation. During his career in television, he served as a "booth announcer", host of a popular children's program entitled "Cartoon Carl" for four years (1957-61), anchored the 10 p.m. newscast (1961-62), served as Sports Director (1963-75) and was host/producer for Auburn head coach Ralph "Shug" Jordan's television show for 13 seasons. It was on this program that the popular phrase "you're so right, Carl" originated. Coach Jordan would always use that phrase in responding to the opening statement on the program. 

<P>
<img src=jordan_stephens02.jpg align=left border=1 width=200 alt="Ralph 'Shug' Jordan and Carl Stephens">

<P>He was named Operations Director in 1975 and then moved to the Cosmos Broadcasting station in Columbia, SC (WIS-TV) as Program Director for two years, returning to WSFA-TV as Program/Promotion Manager in 1978. He retired from the position of Operations/Program Manager at WSFA-TV in March 1998 after serving 42 years with Cosmos Broadcasting.    

<P>Now in the 24th season as the Public Address Announcer for all Auburn home football games (1973-75; 1979-present), Stephens also has served as the PA announcer for home basketball games the past ten years as well as selected baseball games. Regarded as one of the best public address announcers in the nation, he has served as the PA announcer for all seven of the Southeastern Conference Championship football games and has also served in that role for the past seven SEC Basketball Tournaments.

<P>Stephens and his wife, Mary, have been married for 36 years and reside in Montgomery. They have two grown children.
