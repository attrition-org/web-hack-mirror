<P> Entering his first season as head coach and 17th season at Auburn, former Tiger star Steve Renfroe looks to continue the winning tradition he helped establish inder legendary head coach Hal Baird.
<P>  As an assistant coach, Renfroe was responsible for Auburn's hitters and coordinates the Tiger offense from the third base coaches' box.  Under his tutelage, Auburn has led the Southeastern Conference in hitting in five of the last six seasons (1993, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998).  The Tigers have posted the top two batting averages in school history in the last two seasons with a .341 average in 1997 and a .340 mark in 1998.
    <P>In fact, eight of the top 10 team batting averages in Auburn history have come since Renfroe joined the Tiger coaching staff in 1983.
<P>    In addition to batting average, Renfroe's 1997 and 1998 Tigers set 12 single-season hitting records.  Last season, Auburn belted a record 87 home runs while posting a .539 slugging percentage.
<P>    Renfroe has worked with some great hitters during his time as Auburn's batting instructor.  Two-time American League Most Valuable Player Frank Thomas (1987-89) still owns numerous Auburn single-season and career hitting marks.
<P>    Other former Renfroe pupils include Jay Waggoner (1992-95), who is the SEC all-time hits leader with 341 and Josh Etheredge (1995-98) who set Auburn career records in home runs (59) and RBI (269).
<P>    Renfroe also coordinates Auburn's recruiting efforts, which has earned national acclaim on several occasions.
<P>    A native of Lilburn, Ga., Renfroe was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in 1976 and the California Angels in 1979.  After completing his career with Auburn in 1980, Renfroe signed with the Chicago Cubs as a free agent and played for a division winner at Geneva, N.Y.  He finished his professional career in the New York Yankees organization.
<P>    Renfroe remains in the Top 10 in numerous Auburn career lists,  including stolen bases and extra-base hits. He set a Southeastern Conference freshman record and Auburn school record by hitting safely in 23-consecutive games in 1977 and was selected as an SEC All-Western Division outfielder as a senior in 1980.
<P>    Renfroe played for coach Paul Nix from 1977 to 1980, and graduated from Auburn in 1982 with a degree in Marketing Distribution Education.
<P>    In 1984, Renfroe served as an assistant coach for Athletes in Action, a Christian baseball team made up of collegiate all-stars. Athletes in Action, while based in Wichita, Kansas, traveled overseas and competed with teams from Taiwan, Korea and Japan, as well as teams from the Kansas Jayhawk League.
<P>    Renfroe, 41, is married to the former Pam Coleman.  The couple has three daughters, Katie, 5, Laura Grace, 3 and Anne Rebekah 1 year.
