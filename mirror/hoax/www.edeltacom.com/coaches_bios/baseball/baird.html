<P>After 16 seasons as the skipper of the program, Hal Baird left an indelible mark on Auburn baseball.  His coaching resume is dotted with awards and honors bestowed on him and his team during his tenure on the Plains.
<p>In the last nineties alone, Baird guided the Tigers to two Regional titles, a SEC Western Division Championship, and a SEC Tournament Championship.  He has won over 70 percent of his games during the span from 1994-2000.
<p>On February 13, 2000, Baird claimed his 600th victory at Auburn as the Tigers defeated Furman 10-4.
<p>In 1998, Baird became the winningest coach in Auburn history while leading the Tigers to a 46-18 record and their fifth appearance in the NCAA Regionals in the last six seasons.  Auburn also won its first SEC Tournament Championship since 1989, defeating Arkansas 7-5 in the title game.

<p>All of this followed one of the most successful seasons in Auburn history.  The 1997 season marked the second time that the Tigers won 50 games, finishing with a 50-17 mark while advancing to the College World Series for the second time in four seasons.
<p>But one cannot review Auburn's recent baseball renaissance without remarking on the stability that Baird brought to the program since 1985.  He has led Auburn to nine NCAA regionals, and Auburn is one of only three SEC schools who can claim a .500-or-better conference record in 10 of the last 12 years.  The Tigers are also the 21st-winningest program in the decade of the 1990's, winning 65.5 percent of their games.
<p>In addition, the Tigers won at least 30 games in each of Baird's 16 seasons.  A Baird-coached college baseball team has never suffered a losing season in 16 years at Auburn and five at East Carolina.
<p>In Baird's 16 years at Auburn, the Tigers have finished in the upper division of the SEC standings virtually every year.  In 1989, the Tigers failed to finish the regular season among the top five teams, but went on to win the conference tournament and advance to NCAA regional competition.

<h4>Hal Baird’s Most Memorable Moments, Accomplishments, and Seasons at Auburn......</h4>
<P>Hal Baird took time to reflect upon some of his most memorable moments, accomplishments and seasons during his tenure on the Plains.
<P><B>1985 -</B>"Having the priviledge to coach Bo Jackson and laying the foundation of the program."
<BR><B>1986-</B> "We made the SEC Tournament for the first time in six years.  It was great to have the players that had been here finally experience post-season play."
<BR><B>1987-</B> "We had current Major Leaguers’ Frank Thomas and Greg Olson on the team together.  We made the NCAA Tournament for the first time in nine years."
<BR><B>1988-</B> "The thing that sticks out in my mind is that the 1988 team was one of our best teams and we were beset by mononucleous in the last week of the season and our top five players went out.  I don’t know if that’s a highlight or low-light."
<BR><B>1990 -</B> "The main thing I remember was that we had a terrific group of position players but our top four pitchers all came down with season-ending injuries.  I have never seen or heard that happening before."
<BR><B>1993-</B> "We beat Arizona in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.  John Powell struck out 15 batters and threw a two-hitter against the top-ranked offense in the country."
<BR><B>1994-</B>"In consecutive days, we defeated top-ranked Clemson in Clemson and Notre Dame to advance to the College World Series"
<BR><B>1995-</B>"Clinching the SEC West Title with a ninth inning come-from-behind win against LSU in Baton Rouge"
<BR><B>1997-</B>"There were two memorable moments in 1997.  The first was David Ross’ ninth inning home run against Florida State in Tallahassee that put us into the regional finals.  The next was the following day and the Tim Hudson-J.D. Drew match-up.  We defeated Florida State for my 500th career victory at Auburn and we advanced to the College World Series."
<BR><B>1998-</B>"In the first round of the SEC Tournament,  we defeated Alabama in front of 15,000 fans at the Met in Hoover.  We later went on to win the conference tournament title with a victory over Arkansas."
<BR><B>1999-</B> Hosting an NCAA Regional for the first time in 20 years.  To make the event even more memorable was winning the regional in Auburn in front of our fans."
<P>"While there are too many memories and accomplishments to completely list on papter, some of the other things I am proud of are coaching 47 All-SEC players, seven Major Leaguers and seven All-Americans."
<P>"Another accomplishment that can’t go unnoticed is that over 80 percent of the student-athletes that have played baseball at Auburn during the past 15 years have received their degree."
<P>"Assisting in the planning and overseeing the construction of Hitchcock Field at Plainsman Park, which is now one of the finest and most beautiful collegiate facilities in the country."

<p>But it was 1994 that may be looked back upon in the years to come as the "breakthrough" season.  It will be remembered as the year Baird first escorted one of his teams to Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Neb., where Baird himself played for the Triple-A Omaha Royals from 1974-76.
<p>It was a year which recognized Baird's solid work, as he was named South Region Coach of the Year by the American Baseball Coaches' Association.
<p>And it was a year which saw Auburn finish in the nation's top 10 for the first time in 18 seasons.
<p>Baird was named head coach at Auburn in 1985 and immediately turned things around. The Tigers had suffered through three-straight, 10th-place conference finishes and one eighth-place mark in the previous four years.
<p>But Auburn showed improvement with a 30-22 record in his first season and, in 1986, advanced to the SEC Tournament for the first time in six years, finishing third in the league standings.
<p>Baird continued to work his magic in 1987 as he led the Tigers to a 42-18 record, a 18-9 conference mark and a third-place finish in the SEC.  Both the overall and conference wins set new Auburn records for a single season.  The Tigers were rewarded that year with an invitation to the NCAA Regionals, their first in nine years.
<p>In 1988, the Tigers were once again impressive, sporting a 39-16 record and a fourth-place conference finish with a 16-10 league mark. The NCAA was not impressed, however, and Auburn missed out on the 48-team event.
<p>The 1995 team not only won 40, but it did so quicker than any team in SEC history, taking just 45 games to reach that magical accomplishment.  Auburn won the SEC Western Division en route to finishing with a school best record of 50-13.  And, for the first time in school history, the 1995 Tigers were the No. 1 seed at an NCAA Regional and spent part of the season as the top-ranked team in the country.
<p>That came on the heels of taking Auburn to the 1994 NCAA College World Series, the Tigers' first in 18 years.
<p>In his 16 years at Auburn, Baird has coached 46 players who have gone on to play professional baseball.  He has coached three first-round draft picks: pitcher Gregg Olson, drafted in 1988 by the Baltimore Orioles;  first baseman Frank Thomas, selected by the Chicago White Sox in 1989;  and pitcher Chris Bootcheck, drafted in 2000 by the Anaheim Angels.  Olson was an All-America selection in 1987 and 1988, Thomas in 1989, and Bootcheck in 2000.

<P><img src=../../graphics/coaches/baseball/baird07.jpg width=144 height=111 border=1 align=right alt="Hal Baird">
<p>Baird also coached the NCAA's all-time strikeout leader at Auburn, John Powell, who finished his career in 1994 in Omaha with 602 strikeouts and Tim Hudson, who won the 1997 Smith Award, signifying collegiate baseball's top player.
<p>Following a stellar collegiate career as a pitcher at first Ferrum College and then East Carolina, Baird spent seven years in professional baseball with the Kansas City and Cleveland organizations.
<p>As a charter member of the Royals Academy, Baird joined such notables as Frank White and U.L. Washington in helping to break new ground in pro baseball.
<p>Baird posted a career record of 25-16 with a 3.11 ERA from 1971-76.  His 2.97 ERA at Omaha in 1975 was fourth-best in the American Association that year.  In 1976, his final season of pro ball, he had a 2.21 ERA in a career-best 50 appearances.  He was named to all-star teams in both the Gulf Coast League (1971) and the Southern League (1973).
<p>After his pro career, he returned to college baseball where he quickly earned the reputation as a bright and successful coach.
<p>Baird began his coaching career as an assistant at his alma mater, East Carolina, where he worked closely with the pitching staff.  In 1980, he was named East Carolina's head coach and for the next five seasons compiled an overall record of 145-66 (.687).
<p>During his five-year head coaching tenure at East Carolina, Baird's teams made three appearances in the NCAA Tournament and won the Eastern College Athletic Conference championship twice.
<p>In addition to his winning percentage as a coach, his pitching staffs were of national caliber.  In 1981, the Pirate staff led the nation with a 2.78 ERA.  In his eight years with the Pirate program, East Carolina's pitching staffs were ranked in the nation's top 20 five times.
<p>Baird was rewarded for his work at his alma mater in October 1994, when he was inducted into the East Carolina Athletics Hall of Fame.
<p> Baird is married to his high school sweetheart, the former Janie Megee of Corpus Christi, Texas.

<P>"Hal is a great coach - an excellent pitching coach.  While I was there I learned a lot  of things that helped move me on to the next level.  Playing at Auburn for three years was my equivelant of playing three years in the minor leagues.  I received that kind of experience and teaching while I was at Auburn.
