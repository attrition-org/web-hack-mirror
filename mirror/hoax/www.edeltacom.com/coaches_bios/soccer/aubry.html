<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After a successful 
          playing career at Northwestern University, Erin Aubry joined the Auburn 
          soccer staff on August 4, 1999. </font>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A native of Perrysburg, 
          Ohio, Aubry was a midfielder for a successful Northwestern program that 
          made two NCAA Tournament appearances including a Sweet Sixteen showing 
          during her career. Aubry's career was shortened however, as she was 
          forced to sit out the 1994 and 1997 seasons with injuries. </font>

        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a junior in 1996, 
          Aubry started in 14 games and was named most improved player for a Wildcat 
          squad that made an appearance in the NCAA Tournament. Following a medical 
          redshirt in 1997, Aubry was a co-captain on an NU team that was 16-5-1 
          and lost to eventual NCAA Champion Florida, 1-0, in the quarterfinals 
          of the NCAA Tournament. Aubry was earned the coach's award for outstanding 
          leadership upon completion of the 1998 season. </font>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During her career 
          at Northwestern, Aubry played in 55 games, starting in 31 and recorded 
          eight goals, including two game-winning goals. She finished her career 
          with 25 points. </font>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aubry has also developed 
          a great amount of coaching experience at the club level and in the Olympic 
          Development Program. This past year she was the head coach of the Greater 
          Toledo (Ohio) Futbol Club Under 17 team. During the 1996 and 1998 summers, 
          Aubry was also a coach in training for the Region II ODP in DeKalb, 
          Ill. Her club coaching also includes stints as the head coach of the 
          Toledo Blaze Under 16 team, and assistant coach of the U-16, U-12, and 
          U-11 girls teams for the Greater Toledo Futbol Club. She also earned 
          her coaching national diploma from the National Soccer Coaches Association 
          of America in January 1999. </font>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After serving as 
          a camp coach for the three prior summers, this summer Aubry was the 
          camp director for the Northwestern University Youth Girls Soccer Camp 
          that had nearly 300 campers in two weeks. </font>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aubry graduated 
          from Northwestern in December 1998 from the School of Speech with a 
          bachelors degree in communication studies with a concentration in history. 
          </font>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aubry was an excellent 
          high school player as she was a two-time first-team National Soccer 
          Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) All-American. At Perrysbury High 
          School, she was a first team all-state selection as a junior and senior 
          and participated in the 1993 Ohio All-Star Game. In 1990, she was a 
          member of the Region IV Olympic Development Program team. </font>
