<P>Joe Ciampi has never had a losing season.  Not in 20 seasons at Auburn or two at West Point.  Even in nine years as a high school basketball coach, Ciampi always posted winning records.  To say that the man is used to winning would be a major understatement.
<P>The 1998-99 season has proven to be another of Ciampi's amazing coaching efforts.  With no seniors, five juniors, and 11 underclassmen, Ciampi has taken nearly the same squad, that one year ago was 16-11 overall and 4-8 in the SEC, and directed it to a 19-8 record overall, a 8-6 showing in the Southeastern Conference, and an appearance in the NCAA Tournament.  
<P>This season's 19-8 mark entering the NCAA Tournament is Ciampi's fourth-best regular

<BR>season record in the 1990's, and the 8-6 SEC mark is Auburn's best since 1992-93.
<P>The last full season prior to the millennium has also been one of personal milestones for Ciampi.  On Jan. 14, Auburn strolled into Gainesville, Fla. and upset the 18th-ranked Gators and former longtime Ciampi assistant Carol Ross, 76-71, to give its' coach his 500th career victory.  In reaching the 500 career victory plateau, Ciampi became just the 10th women's coach to notch 500 wins at the division I level.
<P>In 1997, Ciampi added yet another accomplishment to his already lengthy coaching resume by guiding Auburn to its fourth SEC Tournament title, which may have been the biggest Cinderella stories ever experienced in the SEC.  Consider the list of firsts that the head coach and his Tigers accomplished by capturing the championship.  As the ninth seed, they became the lowest seed ever to win the tournament.  AU was only the third team to advance to the finals after playing on the first day.  And, Auburn beat three top ten teams, Georgia, Tennessee, and Florida to win the title. 
<P>The championship was Ciampi's seventh at Auburn.  The Tigers also captured SEC Tournament titles in 1981, 1987 and 1990.  Auburn was crowned SEC Regular Season Champions in 1987, 1988 and 1989.
<P>Then there's the NCAA Tournament.  The Tigers have made 14 appearances in the prolific competition, capturing the Mideast Regional championship three times en route to the Final Four.  Auburn  advanced to the national championship game three-straight times, doing so in 1988, 1989, and 1990.
<P>In 20 years at the helm of the program, Ciampi has won over three-quarters of his games at the Plains, compiling a 467-149 (.758) record.  His overall record of 506-159 (.761) rates him as the 10th-winningest active division I coach in winning percentage and ninth among active division I coaches in wins.
<P>Ciampi, the most successful women's coach in Auburn history, was named National Coach of the Year in 1987, 1989 and 1993, and SEC Coach of the Year in 1985, 1988 and 1989.
<P>In 1996, he won his 400th game at Auburn when the Tigers beat UAB, 80-39.  In 1994, Ciampi notched his 400th overall win, becoming only the second male coach ever to accomplish such a feat.
<P>Ciampi arrived on the Plains in 1979 after serving two seasons as head coach of the U.S. Military Academy.  A Tiger program that had gone 17-36 over the previous two seasons was about to do an about face.
<P>In his first season at the helm, Ciampi directed his troops to a 17-13 record and the tone for success had been set.  Since then, the Tigers have eclipsed the 20-victory plateau in 14 of 19 seasons.  They've won 25 or more games eight times and posted a record of 95-7 over a three-year span from 1986-1989 -- the nation's best mark during that time.
<P>Added to the team accomplishments are individual honors.  Ciampi has coached four players to Kodak All-American honors.  Carolyn Jones made SEC history in 1991 by becoming the first player to earn Player-of-the-Year honors twice.  That prestigious honor has also been won by Vickie Orr  in 1988 and Lauretta Freeman in 1993.
<P>In addition, Auburn players have gained 36 All-SEC honors and four other players have held spots on All-SEC freshman squads.    
<P>This season, Conswella Sparrow and Tasha Hamilton were first-team All-SEC selections.
<P>Auburn players have also won 16 SEC All-Tournament honors and four SEC Tournament Most Valuable Player awards.  Tara Williams and Tiffany Krantz were 1997 all-tournament selections while Laticia Morris was named the most valuable player.
<P>Auburn has made its mark in the classroom also.  The Tigers have earned Academic All-SEC acclaim on 25 different occasions, including a record five this season.  Lynn Stevenson, a Tiger from 1986-1991, is the only player in conference history to be named to the academic honor roll four-straight seasons.
<P>The list of accomplishments of Auburn players doesn't end once their eligibility is completed.  Three former players have won Olympic medals, led by Ruthie Bolton who scored 15 points and grabbed five steals in leading Team USA to a win over Brazil in the 1996 gold medal game.  Vicki Orr and Carolyn Jones won bronze medals as members of the 1992 USA Olympic Team.
<P>In 1996, seven Ciampi-coached players were drafted by the American Basketball League.  It was the third highest total chosen by the new professional league.  Four players, Lauretta Freeman, Linda Godby, Carolyn Jones, and Laticia Morris played for the ABL during the 1997-98 season.
<P>Former Auburn players are also represented in the WNBA.  Ruthie Bolton and Chantel Tremitiere both play for the Sacramento Monarchs while Tara Williams was on the Phoenix Mercury team in 1998.
<P>A native of Glen Lyon, Pa., and a 1968 graduate of Mansfield University in Mansfield, Pa., Ciampi coached nine years on the high school level before entering the collegiate ranks.  After four years at Nanticoke Area (Pa.) High School and a record of 82-19, Ciampi moved to New York to head the program at Marlboro Central.  He spent five years there, compiling a mark of 73-23.  Overall, his high school coaching tally comes to  a formidable 156-42.
<P>Ciampi and his wife, the former Laureen Nagy of Morrisville, Pa., reside in Auburn.  They have four daughters, Lisa, Dawne, Kelli and Meghan.  Lisa played for her father from 1988-91, lettering all four seasons, and is a Auburn graduate along with Dawne.
