<P>When Tommy Tuberville accepted the job as Auburn's head football coach his first priority was to name the assistants that would make up his staff. After debating on several individuals for the defensive coordinator position, Tuberville decided the best man to run the Tigers defense was John Lovett, the former defensive backs at Ole Miss.

 <P>Lovett, 47, brings a long, 23 year coaching career with him to Auburn. As a graduate of C.W. Post College, Lovett earned his B.A. degree and earned three letters as a linebacker while playing football there. The next year while earning his Masters degree from the University of Denver, Lovett also performed various tasks for the school from graduate assistant to assistant junior varsity basketball coach. 
 
<P>Two years later, in 1976, he took his first football coaching job as defensive coordinator at St. Joseph's Regional High School in Montvale, New Jersey. After spending two seasons there, Lovett joined the collegiate ranks in 1978 as defensive coordinator and assistant at Union College in Schenectady, New York, where he spent five years (1978-82) before moving on to coach linebackers at Brown University in 1983.

<P>Lovett left Brown after one season to join the New York Jets in 1984 as a defensive intern coach. While with the Jets, Lovett worked with the secondary, ran scout teams, and helped with special teams. His off the field duties included help in developing and operating the NFL club's computer system.

<P>Lovett returned to the college ranks in 1985 as defensive coordinator and secondary coach at the University of Maine. During his four-year stay at Maine (1985-88), the Bears produced four straight winning seasons.

<P>Lovett moved on to take the job as defensive coordinator at the University of Cincinnati in 1989, a position he held through the 1992 season, before taking the job as secondary coach at the University of Nevada Las-Vegas in 1993.

<P>Lovett left UNLV to return to the University of Maine to regain the task of defensive coordinator in 1994. His stay at Maine this time was again brief as he joined Tommy Tuberville and his staff at Ole Miss later that season. There he spent four years (1994-98) as the Rebels defensive backs coach before being named as Auburn's new defensive coordinator this year.

 <P>Lovett is married to the former Carol O'Connor of Dover Foxcroft, Maine.
