<P>As the final month of a turbulent 1998 football season came to a close, Auburn Athletic Director David Housel was diligently in search of someone to smooth the choppy waters and reunite an Auburn football family in disrepair.
<P> Before the Thanksgiving leftovers could be served the next day, Housel had his man. On Nov. 28, 1998 Tommy Tuberville was named the 25th head football coach in Auburn history.
<P> Tuberville comes to Auburn from the University of Mississippi, where he guided the Rebels to a 25-20 record over the last four years. He replaces Bill Oliver who stepped in as Auburn's interim head coach after the resignation of Terry Bowden at mid-season.
<P> "Needless to say, we are excited to be in Auburn and plan on being here a long, long time," Tuberville said. "This is the kind of program I've spent my entire career dreaming about coaching in. 
<P> "Auburn is the kind of place where you can win championships and we plan on doing just that," he said.
<P> "We've been involved in some good programs along the way, but we plan on Auburn being the last stop. Auburn is the place to raise our boys and fulfill our dreams," Tuberville said. "I've already been touched by the Auburn spirit, the warmth and hospitality shown to us in just a short time affirms what I believed when I accepted this position. We plan on this being our last stop."
<P> "You can't be around the Southeastern Conference over the last several years and not be impressed with the job Tommy Tuberville has done at Ole Miss," Housel said. "At a time when most expected the Ole Miss program to be down due to scholarship sanctions, he not only kept the program competitive, he won.
<P> "Tommy is one of the most sought after young coaches in America," Housel said. "We are extremely happy he is coming here to build on our tradition and establish Auburn as a football power into the next century."
<P> Inheriting an Ole Miss program plagued by NCAA sanctions and probation, Tuberville guided the Rebels to a winning record in his first season in 1995, despite having just 61 players on scholarship. He did not have a full compliment of scholarship players to work with in any of his four years at Ole Miss.
<P> By the time he had three recruiting classes under his belt, Tuberville led Ole Miss to an 8-4 mark and a victory in the inaugural Motor City Bowl in 1997. His efforts earned him Associated Press SEC Coach of the Year Honors and American Football Quarterly magazine selected him as runner-up for its Schutt Sports Coach of the Year honor.
<P> Prior to becoming head coach at Ole Miss, Tuberville worked with two of the most successful college football programs in the nation. In 1994, he served as defensive coordinator and linebackers coach at Texas A&M. Prior to that he was a member of the University of Miami staff for eight seasons, taking over as defensive coordinator in 1993.
<P> In his one season at Texas A&M, the Aggie defense finished fourth nationally in scoring defense (13.1 ppg), fifth in total defense (265.5 ypg) and sixth in rushing defense (92.4 ypg). The Aggies posted a 10-0-1 record and a No. 8 national ranking in 1994.
<P> While serving on the staffs of Jimmy Johnson and Dennis Erickson at Miami, Tuberville was a defensive coach on teams which won three national championships, posted an 87-9 record and played in nine consecutive New Year's Day bowls.
<P> As defensive coordinator for the Hurricanes in 1993, Tuberville directed a Miami defense which was ranked No. 3 nationally in scoring defense (12.6 ppg) and No. 5 nationally in pass defense (91.15 ypg).
<P> Tuberville began his collegiate coaching career at Arkansas State in 1980, coaching various segments of the Indians' defense over the next five seasons. During a five-year stay at Arkansas State, Tuberville coached defensive backs, noseguards and linebackers. During his final year at ASU, the Indians advanced to the second round of the NCAA Division 1-AA playoffs.
<P> He began his coaching career at Hermitage (Ark.) High School where he spent two years as an assistant and two as a head coach. After three straight four-win seasons, Tuberville guided HHS to a 7-3 mark in 1979 before moving to Arkansas State.
<P> A 1976 graduate of Southern Arkansas University, Tuberville was a three-year letterman at free safety and a two-year member of the golf team at SAU. He is a 1972 graduate of Harmony Grove High School in Camden, Ark.
<P> Tuberville is married to the former Suzanne Fette of Guilford, Ind. They are the parents of two sons, Thomas Tucker (4) and Troy Allen (2).
