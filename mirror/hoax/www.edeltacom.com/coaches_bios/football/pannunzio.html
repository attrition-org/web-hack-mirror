<P>Joe Pannunzio, 40, one of Tommy Tuberville's assistants at Ole Miss, joins the Auburn staff to take on the duties of working with the Tigers tight ends and special teams.

 <P>Pannunzio, who spent the previous four seasons with Tommy Tuberville at Ole Miss, is a native of Pueblo, Colorado. He attended Southern Colorado from 1978-82 where he played quarterback and graduated with a Bachelors degree in Physical Education. While at Southern, he served as captain of the 1981 squad, which finished the season ranked No. 9 in NAIA Division I.
 
<P>He began his coaching career, in 1982, at his alma mater as an assistant coach. His stay at Southern was brief, starting in January and leaving in August to take the offensive coordinator job at Mesa College. During his three year stay at Mesa, Pannunzio coached three ALL- Americans, seven All- Confernce selections, and a quarterback who set a national record for consecutive passes without an interception (231).

<P>Pannunzio left Mesa after the 1984 season to take a graduate assistant position at the University of Kansas. The following year, in 1986, he became a full time assistant coach with the Jayhawks, working with wide receivers, tight ends, and special teams. He stayed at Kansas through the 1987 season before leaving to return to Mesa in 1988. Pannunzio left Mesa after 1989 to take an assistants job at Texas Christian University. There he coached All- America tight end Kelly Blackwell, who broke the NCAA record for career catches by a tight end.

<P>After a brief, 2-year stay with the Horned Frogs, Pannunzio took the tight ends and special teams job at the University of Minnesota where he stayed from 1992-94. During the 1992 season, Minnesota led the Big Ten Conference in kickoff returns and had the nation's No. 2 kick returner.

<P>Pannunzio's next stop came in 1994 when he joined Tommy Tuberville at Ole Miss. There he coached All-America tight end Kris Mangum and his special teams unit ranked third best in the SEC and 19th in the nation.

<P> He and his wife Rita are the parents of two daughters, Angela and Nico, and one son, Mario.
