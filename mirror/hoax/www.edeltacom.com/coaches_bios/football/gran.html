<P>Eddie Gran, the former running backs coach at Ole Miss, comes over with new head coach Tommy Tuberville to take on the task of getting the Tigers running game back on track.

 <P>Gran is a native of Escondido, California who after graduating from Orange Glen High School in 1983, went to California Lutheran University where he played four years (1984-87) and earned four letters as a wide receiver. He graduated from there in 1987 with a B.S. degree in Business Administration. 
 
<P>Gran's first coaching opportunity came at his alma mater where he coached wide receivers during the 1987 and 1988 seasons. In 1989 Gran took the job as running backs coach at Southeast Missouri State but left prior to the 1989 season to take a graduate assistant position at East Carolina, where he worked with defensive backs.

<P>After working one season at East Carolina, Gran moved on to take a graduate assistant job at the University of Miami in 1990. There he met and worked with now new Auburn head coach Tommy Tuberville. In 1991 Gran moved over to the offensive side of the ball to work with the Miami quarterback's, which included Heisman Trophy winner Gino Torretta.

<P>During his two years at Miami, the Hurricanes went 10-2 during the 1990 campaign and 12-0 in 1991 winning the National Championship. After Gran left Miami, he went on to coach wide receivers in 1992 and 1993 at Cincinnati and at Idaho St. in 1994 before joining Tuberville at Ole miss later that year.

<P>While at Ole Miss, Gran coached John Avery, who was a 1997 first round pick of the Miami Dolphins. He also coached Dou Innocent who now plays for the Kansas City Chiefs. Gran would coach at Ole Miss for four years (1994-98) prior to joining Tommy Tuberville and the Auburn staff in 1999.

<P>Gran is married to the former Rosemary Scaife of Elaine, Arkansas. They have two daughters, Hannah and Dillan Rivers.
