Auburn Athletic Director David Housel and Head Swimming
Coach David Marsh announced the hiring of new Head Diving Coach Jeff Shaffer.  Shaffer replaces former
diving coach Rick Theobald who left in May to pursue other interests.  Shaffer comes to Auburn after a 
four-year stint at the University of Southern California.
<P>"We are extremely excited to welcome Jeff and his family to Auburn.  With his successes in the past,
he brings to Auburn a tremendous amount of experience," said Marsh.  "He has consistently coached divers
to finals at NCAA competitions as well as at the national levels.  His expertise and ability to recruit will only
contribute to Auburn's goal of being a top program year in and year out."        
<P>The three-time PAC-10 Diving Coach of the Year helped guide USC's Women's team to the
national title in 1997 and was also named the United States Olympic Committee National Diving
Coach of the Year in 1997 and 1998.  In six years of coaching Division I, Shaffer has coached one
national champion, two silver medalists and five bronze medalists as well as eight individuals to 21
All-America honors and eight honorable mention honors.
<P>"USC has been good to me and my family, but this is such a great opportunity and that is what makes
this move so attractive," said Shaffer.  "I really look forward to making a contribution to Coach Marsh, his
talented staff and the Auburn program.  It will take a year or two to get where we want to be with the diving
program but it will be a great challenge."
<P>Prior to USC he coached at LSU for two years where he coached four All-Americans, including a 1-2
finish in the women's 1994 NCAA platform competition.
<P>    Shaffer also served as the USA Coach at the 1998 Goodwill Games and the 1994 Goodwill Games
in St. Petersburg, Russia.  
<P>At the club level, Shaffer, 41, has coached eight world individual champions, two senior national
champions, 37 junior national champions and three team junior national championships during his 18-year
tenure.
<P>A 1980 graduate of Wisconsin, Shaffer and his wife Jenny have two daughters, Amy and Kelly and a
son, Jeffery, Jr.
