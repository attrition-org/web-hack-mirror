<P>
Commitment, pride, passion and winning, the ingredients head coach David Marsh thrives upon in achieving success.  Marsh, 39, has restablished the Auburn swimming program into one of the top programs in the country.  His men’s program garners a national title, four Southeastern Conference titles and five top ten NCAA finishes, while his women’s program has six runner-up SEC finishes and have finished in the top ten nationally for the past two years.
<P>Since becoming the head coach of his alma mater in 1990, the women’s and men’s teams at the university have been successful in both the pool and the classroom.  Marsh took a diminished program and revitalized it with confidence, support, character and success.  After winning the 1997 National Championship, Marsh was truly moved by the accomplishments of his athletes and felt that it was a victory for the hundreds of former Auburn swimmers and divers who had gone through the program.
<P>Marsh was also a factor in convincing the NCAA to grant Auburn University the chance to host the 1998 Men’s Swimming and Diving Championships.  The Tigers hosted a stellar event as well as grabbing the runner-up position for the second time under Marsh’s tenure.
<P>At the 1998 SEC Championships in Gainesville, Fla., the women’s 200 medley relay team set the American record with a time of 1:38.56.  Katie Ryan, Brook Monroe, Mimi Bowen and Katie Taylor opened many eyes in the swimming world as they went down in Auburn history as the first American Record holders ever for the women’s program.  
<P>During his reign at Auburn, Marsh’s teams have earned 515 All-America honors by 75 swimmers, along with 35 NCAA individual titles and 88 SEC individual titles.  Internationally, 13 Auburn individuals have won a medal in 34 events.  The competitions range from the World University Games, the Goodwill Games, the World Championships, the Pan-American Games, the Pan-Pacific Games and the Olympics.  Among these elite individuals are Olympic Gold medalist’s Scott Tucker and John Hargis and most recently Bill Pilczuk, the World Champion in the 50 free.

<P>Since ’91, the Plains have been home to five Olympians.  In addition to Tucker and Hargis, Yoav Bruck and Eithan Urbach competed for Israel and Nick Shackell competed for Great Britain.  Other medalist in international competition include Scott Jett (Auburn, ‘94) and Kurt Jachimowski (Auburn, ‘96) and current AU swimmers Bowen, Taylor and Brock Newman.  
<P>From age group coaching to Olympic coaching, Marsh has experienced success at all levels.  In his first year as head coach at Auburn the Tiger men finished 20th at NCAA’s and 6th at SEC’s while the women finished 30th in the NCAA’s and 5th in the SEC’s.  The following year the men moved up five places to 15th while the women soared up into the top ten with an 8th place finish.  The two teams have continued to move forward and are now considered among the top programs in the nation.  In 1997, Marsh and his staff and team brought to the Plains the most coveted prize at the collegiate level, the program’s first-ever national title.    
<P>A five-time All-American backstroker at Auburn, he was the 1980 SEC backstroke champion and was ranked sixth in the world at the time.  After earning a degree in Business Administration from Auburn in 1981, Marsh remained at Auburn as an assistant coach.  In 1985 he left to accept the head coach position of the Dynamo Swim Club in Atlanta, Ga.  Three years later Marsh then moved west to coach the Las Vegas Gold Swim Team.  During Marsh’s tenure in Vegas, he led ten swimmers, including former teammate Ambrose "Rowdy" Gaines, to the 1988 Olympic Trials and Melvin Stewart to his first american record in the 200 fly.
<P>Under Marsh, Auburn swimmers have excelled at the national and international levels of competition and most importantly, in the classroom.  According to Marsh, success in the pool is success out of the pool.  In eight seasons, 106 swimmers (55 men, 51 women) have been chosen to the SEC Academic Honor Roll and 15 Academic All-Americans.
<P>A native of Miami, Florida, he was recently inducted into the ODK Honorary Society and was also given a plaque on the "Tiger Trail" of Auburn.  Marsh is married to the former Kristin Burke who was a swimmer at California-Berkeley.  She earned her masters degree in English Education at Auburn in March of 1995.  The couple has two children, Aaron and Alyssa.
