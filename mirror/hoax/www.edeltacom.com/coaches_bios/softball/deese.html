<P>As she enters her third season as head coach of Auburn Softball, Tina Deese looks to continue building a solid foundation for the future of the program.  Deese came to Auburn after eight years at Huntingdon College  in Montgomery, Ala. 
<P>Entering her eleventh year as a head coach, Deese was responsible for building the program at Huntingdon  from the ground up and into a national NAIA power.  In Deese’s first year, she led Huntingdon to a 26-10 mark. Huntingdon amassed an overall record of 286-123 in Deese’s eight years at the helm, including third place finishes in the National NAIA tournament in 1992 and 1994. She was named the 1992 District 27 Coach of the Year.
<P>In addition to her duties as softball coach, Deese also handled volleyball head coaching duties and served as the director of recreation and intramurals while at Huntingdon.
<P>Prior to her arrival at Huntingdon, Deese served as a pitching coach at her alma mater, Florida State from 1985-86.
<P>Deese brings to Auburn a wealth of experience not only as a coach,

but also as a player. Deese began her playing career in 1982 as a member of Golden West College’s (California) Varsity Softball team. She helped lead the team to the California State Championship in 1983 and was named the California State Championship Most Valuable Player.
<P>Her accomplishments at Golden West led her east to Florida State University where she once again was greeted with immediate success.

She was also named to the All-Southeast Region First Team—a feat she duplicated her second season with the Lady Seminoles.
<P>Away from her work at Huntingdon, Deese spent her summers as a camp counselor and pitching instructor at the Joanne Graf  Softball Camp in Tallahassee, Fla.
<P>Deese received a Bachelor of Science degree in Leisure Services and Studies from Florida State in 1986.
