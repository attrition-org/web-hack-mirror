<P>Auburn coach Mike Griffin has made a name for himself as well as for Auburn men's golf over his 15-year coaching career at Auburn.  He has done so by leading the Tigers to 10-straight NCAA postseason appearances and seven  of the last 10 NCAA championships.  He has developed Auburn golf into one of the top golf programs in the country.</font>
<P>Griffin began his competitive golf career while in college.  Griffin won the 1968 and 1969 Alabama Collegiate Conference Championships as well as 30 other amateur tournaments while playing at Troy State University in Troy, Ala.
<P>A four-year letterman at Troy, Griffin became one of the Trojans' all-time greats. After graduating in 1970 with a bachelor's degree in Education, he traveled the mini-tour circuit.
<P>Griffin returned to Troy in 1974 as the head golf coach.  At Troy, Griffin led the Trojans to a .717 winning percentage while amassing 1,644 wins.  In 11 seasons, his teams won the Gulf South Conference seven times and never finished lower than second.  The Trojans also appeared in the Division II Championships, finishing lower than fourth only once.
<P>He was named Gulf South Conference Coach of the Year nine times, and 23 of his golfers earned All-America honors a total of 32 times.  Griffin also led the Trojans to three national championships, including back-to-back titles in 1976 and 1977.
<P>After moving to Auburn, Griffin's first two Tiger teams traveled to the NCAA Championship, finishing 18th in 1985 and 22nd in 1986.  For his accomplishments in leading the 1985 team to two tournament victories and the NCAA Championship, Griffin was named District III South Coach of the Year.
<P>Auburn's 1988 squad broke a two-year tournament winless streak by capturing the inaugural Billy Hitchcock Intercollegiate.  The win was doubly sweet for Griffin.  His second goal upon coming to Auburn was to establish a tournament featuring the nation's top teams.  The reality of the Hitchcock has taken Auburn golf to a new level.  Griffin's drive for success has taken the Hitchcock to national prominence.
<P>In 1990, Griffin led a the Tigers to a fifth-place finish at the Southeastern Conference Championship and to the NCAA East Regional.  In one of the greatest personal performances in Auburn history, Jimmy Green won individual honors while leading Auburn to its first regional title.  The NCAA Championship saw the Tigers finish 25th.
<P>Griffin's team had its best postseason finish in 1994.  Auburn tied for second at the SEC Championship with Tennessee.  The Tigers hosted the NCAA East Regional at Grand National's par-72 Lakes Course in Opelika, Ala.,  and  finished tied for ninth and advanced to the NCAA Championship.
<P>Auburn finished tied for seventh in the NCAA Championship behind senior Will Blackmon, a Ben Hogan Award winner.
<P>In his 24-year career, Griffin has defeated 3,333 teams, a record as impressive as any in golf.  His commitment to the team goes beyond the golf course.
<P>Griffin has coached nine Academic All-SEC selections during his tenure to promote not only excellence on the golf course, but also in the classroom.  Griffin has helped to maintain a balance between academics and athletics.  
<P>In adding to his numerous honors, Griffin was named the 1993-94 and 1994-95 NCAA Coach of the Year for Region III South. He was also named the 1995 SEC Coach of the Year, while coaching the 1995 SEC Player of the Year and All-America selection Iain Steel.  
<P>Griffin also helped lead All-American Chip Spratlin to Auburn's only individual NCAA Championship.  Griffin coached 1996 All-SEC selection Jay Hobby to the 1996 Billy Hitchcock individual title and the Tigers to the team championship.
<P>In the spring of 1997, Griffin led Auburn to its third-straight Billy Hitchcock Intercollegiate championship as Jason Dufner became the second Auburn player to win the individual title in as many years. 
<P>Griffin was named 1997 SEC Co-Coach of the Year after leading the Tigers to a second-place conference finish.  Griffin led Auburn to the NCAA East Regional championship, the team's fifth tournament championship of the 1996-97 season, setting a new school record.
<P>During the 1997-98 season Griffin led the Tigers to a 145-54-4 record and recorded nine top-five finishes including a third place finish at the NCAA East Regional.  The Tigers concluded the 1997-98 season with a 10th place finish at the NCAA Championship, the second highest finish in school history.
<P>In his 15 years at Auburn, Griffin has led the Tigers to 20 tournament titles. He also has coached a total of 12 tournament champions that have captured a total of 24 individual titles.  
<P>Griffin was also influential in Auburn landing the 2000 NCAA Championship for the first time ever.  The Championship will be held at Opelika's Grand National Lake Course.
<P>Mike Griffin has taken Auburn golf to new levels of prominence and continues to raise the level of excellence as he leads Auburn Golf into the 21st century.
