<P>Jamie Green enters his second season as Auburn's assistant men's golf coach.  Before arriving at Auburn last season, Green had coaching stints as both Dartmouth's assistant men's coach and Tulane's assistant women's coach seasonally last year where he worked directly with the teams in competition and at practices and handled budgeting responsibilities.</font>
<P>Since arriving on the Plains in 1997, Green has assisted head coach Mike Griffin in conducting intrasquad qualifiers, helped considerably in the recruiting realm and helped with daily administrative responsibilities.
<P>"Coach Green did a great job for us last year.  ," Griffin said. "He brings us many years of experience and a good background that will help our players.  He is going to help us  even more this year.  We are fortunate enough to have Coach Green with us this season especially since we have such a young golf team so he will be even more of an asset this season."  Green also served as the head assistant golf professional at Hanover Country Club at Dartmouth College from 1994 to 1997.  He taught at several Nike junior golf camps from 1994 to 1997 and has held positions as an assistant golf professional at numerous country clubs, including PGA National Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.
<P>Green earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1993 where he worked in the sports information office.  Green was a three-year letterman on the Ohio Wesleyan men's golf team and participated in the 1992 NCAA Division III Championship Tournament.
<P>"Last season, I  gained alot of valuable experience," Green said.   "This season with the young team we have, I will be able to work more with our players, and I will be alot more active in preparing our golf team."</TD></TR>
