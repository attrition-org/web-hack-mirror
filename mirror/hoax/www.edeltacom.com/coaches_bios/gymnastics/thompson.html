<P>Jeff Thompson joins the Auburn coaching family after serving as assistant coach at LSU from 1994-1999 under Sara "D-D" Breaux.                     
<P>During Thompson's five-year stint in Baton Rouge the Tigers made four trips to the NCAA Championships.
<P>In the past five years, LSU earned 35 Academic All-American honors and 35 spots on the Southeastern Conference Academic Honor Roll, setting the conference record with 11 in 1998.
<P>After the 1998 season, LSU was ranked second in the nation among Division I gymnastics programs according to team grade point average, which was better than 3.50.
<P>Before LSU, Thompson coached at the Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy where he coached five U.S. National Team members and two Olympic Gold Medal Gymnasts. Jaycie Phelps and Amanda Borden were both members of the 1996 Olympic Gymnastics team, which won the gold.  Thompson acted as the Junior Olympic Program Director at Cincinnati from 1993-94.
<P>A native of Highland Heights, Ky., Thompson stayed in his home state for college as he attended the University of Kentucky.  As a 1985 graduate Thompson received his bachelor's degree in physical education and his master's degree in biomechanics.
<P><img src=../../graphics/coaches/gymnastics/thompson03.jpg width=144 border=1 align=right>
<P>With knowledge and experience in biomechanics, Thompson has the capability to understand the methods of performing gymnastic skills to perfection and has thus been considered an expert in his profession.
<P>The first stop in Thompson's coaching career occurred at his alma mater, Kentucky, where he served as a graduate assistant coach for four years (1986-89).  Following that, Thompson traveled to the University of Wisconsin for two years as an assistant coach, before Wisconsin dropped five varsity sports including gymnastics.  Thompson also spent two years at the University of Illinois as an assistant coach.
<P>With extraordinary technical, motivational, and recruiting skills Thompson has been nationally recognized as one of the best assistant coaches in the nation and was named the Central Region Assistant Coach of the Year in 1995 after his first season at LSU.
<P>Thompson has also served as a Promotions Director at the Wisconsin United Athletic Club, a Graduate Teaching Assistant at the University of Kentucky, and  the Gymnastics Director of the National Youth Sports Program in 1986.
<P>Thompson has worked with many nationally renowned gymnastics camps.  In 1993 Thompson worked at the USA National Team Training Camp in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He was also involved with the University of Alabama Gymnastics Camp in 1995, 97, 98, as well as the University of Georgia Gymnastics camp in 1997 and 1998.
<P>Thompson is married to former LSU gymnast Rachelle Fruge, who was a three time All-American during her time as a Tiger and was the SEC All-Around Champion in 1991.  The couple has two children, Parker Allen (4), and Griffin Fruge (2).
