<P>
When Auburn Head Coach Ralph Spry was faced with hiring a new field events coach, he was able to attracted one of the highest regarded field events coaches in Jerry Clay-ton.  Clayton begins his first season on the Plains after spending the past three seasons at the University of Florida as the Gators’ field events coach.  Clayton's background and experiences will allow Auburn field events to make greater strides towards national prominents. </font>
<P>At Florida, Clayton coached three athletes to five All-America honors in 1998 and during his three-year stint in Gainesville, Clayton-coached athletes earned 10 All-America accolades.  Clayton has also directed three Southeastern Conference individual champions in the high jump and long jump.
    <P>Prior to his arrival at Florida, Clayton spent five seasons as the head men and women’s coach at Southwest Texas State from 1990-94.  At Southwest Texas State, Clayton led the Bobcat programs to a combined four Southland Conference Championships and guided the men's team to a school-best seventh place finish at the 1990 NCAA Outdoor Championships.
<P>Before joining Southwest Texas State, Clayton was an assistant men’s track and field coach for nine seasons (1980-89) at his alma mater, the University of Illinois.  During his tenure at Illinois, he guided the Fighting Illini to seven Big 10 track and field titles and three top-10 national finishes, including a runner-up showing at the 1988 NCAA Indoor Championships.
<P>In 16 years of collegiate coaching, Clayton has produced six NCAA individual champions, 13 international team competitors and 14 U.S. Olympic Trials qualifiers.  The Rushville, Ill., native, has also coached 36 NCAA All-Americans and 78 individual conference champions.
<P>Clayton-coached athletes were also represented at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, as three competed in the Games, while six total participated in the U.S. Olympic Trials.  One of Clayton’s pupils, Charles Austin, captured the gold medal in the high jump at the ’96 Olympics.
<P>Clayton coached athletes have included NCAA champions Dean Starkey (pole vault), Drew Fucci (decathlon), Mike Lehmann (shot put) and Austin (long jump).  He has also tutored three-time NCAA pole vault runner-up Lane Lohr and All-American javelin thrower and 1996 Olympian, Edgar Baumann.
<P>A 1980 graduate of the University of Illinois with a B.S. in physical education, Clayton was a two-time NCAA qualifier in the shot put as a member of the Illinois track and field team.
<P>Clayton and his wife, Becky, a former three-time All-American long jumper at Illinois, have two children. Zachery, 11, and Nicholas, nine.
