While Layne Anderson may be serving his second year as the cross country and assistant track and field coach at Auburn University, he is no stranger to the Plains. Anderson spent five years at Auburn pursuing his Doctorate degree and getting acquainted with the coaching profession. He returned last sesaon to Auburn after spending the 1996-97 seasonas an assistant coach at Texas Tech University.</font>
<P>In his first year at Auburn, Anderson-coached 800-meter runner Aaron Richberg ran to All-America honors, both indoor and outdoor, and set a new school record in the 800 meters.  Lindsey Rogers and Margaret Smith each established new freshman distance marks last season under Anderson's guidance.
<P>Anderson came to Auburn in 1991 after receiving his Masters of Education from The Citadel. He spent one year there as a volunteer graduate assistant for the track and field team. His duties at The Citadel introduced him to the day by day administrative duties of a coach as well as the recruitment of student athletes.
<P>Upon arriving at Auburn in 1991, Anderson worked as a graduate teaching assistant and provided physiological consultation for the Tiger cross country and swimming teams. He provided nutritional advice and performed physiological tests on these as well as other Auburn athletes. Anderson continued in this capacity until he left Auburn for Texas Tech in 1996.
<P>In 1995, Anderson began serving as a graduate assistant for Auburn's men's track and field and cross country team. His primary responsibilities were to develop training and mechanics programs for middle distance and sprint athletes.
<P>Through the year of 1995-1996 Anderson assisted in coaching 1996 Olympians Samual Matete of Zambia, a silver medalist in the 400-meter hurdles, and Tommy Asinga, a two-time Olympian from Suriname. He supervised their daily workouts and implemented several strategies for their strength, conditioning, and future workouts.
<P>In 1996 Anderson left Auburn to accept an assistant coaching position with Texas Tech's men's track and field team. His duties there were expanded as he was responsible for the training of the cross country team, the middle distance, and distance runners as well as the hurdlers and vaulters. 
<P>In Anderson's tenure at Tech, six athletes earned nine All-American awards and one GTE All-District award.
<P>An accomplished distance runner himself, Anderson has won at all levels of competition. While he was a high school student in Germany, Anderson placed fourth at the Junior National Championships. As a student at The Citadel, he set ten school records, was a three-time Southern Conference champion, and a four time All-Southern Conference academic selection.
