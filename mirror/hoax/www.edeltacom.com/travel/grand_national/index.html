      <td>Golf Digest calls the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail "the best thing 
        ever done for public golf," and Grand National's 54 holes are the crown 
        jewels of the Trail. <br>
        <br>
        The Links Course was named by Golf Digest as the 2nd best new public course 
        in America in 1993. The Lake Course was named by Golf Digest as the 4th 
        best new public course in America in 1993. The entire complex at Grand 
        National was listed by Golf Digest's Places To Play as three of the nation's 
        40 Super Valuecourses. Grand National, by all reports, was the single 
        greatest site for a golf complex Robert Trent Jones, Sr. had ever seen. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Built on 600-acre Lake Saughahatchee, 32 of the 54 holes drape along its 
        filigreed shores. The cornerstone of the complex is the Links Course, 
        which is without a single weakness. The par-four 18th is, without a doubt, 
        the strongest finishing hole on the Trail. The drive must carry a corner 
        of the Lake, while the approach is played to a shallow pedestal green 
        shored up by boulders. <br>
        <br>
        With 12 holes hugging the shore, Grand National's Lake Course is every 
        bit as scenic as the Links. Not only is the quartes of par threes on the 
        Lake Course as good as any in the nation, the 230-yard, island green 15th 
        may be the single prettiest hold on the Trail. The Short Course at Grand 
        National is a thing of beauty, with more than half the holes touching 
        the lake. This 18-hole course of one-shoters might be the finest anywhere 
        on the planet, according to some golf writers. <br>
        <br>
        The LPGA Tournament of Champions was played at Grand National on October 
        5th-11th. The $750,000 purse event brought the champions of the tour like 
        Nancy Lopez, Laura Davies, Annika Sorenstam and Karrie Webb to the Opelika-Auburn 
        area. The tournament benefitted Breast Cancer Research through donations 
        to the Susan G. Komen Funds. <br>
