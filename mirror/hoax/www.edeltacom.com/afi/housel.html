                Since David Housel was named Auburn's 13th Athletic Director on 
                April 1, 1994, progress has been the one constant at Auburn. </p>
              <p> A $4.2 million facelift to Plainsman Park made Auburn's baseball 
                facility one of the most beautiful college parks in America. The 
                3,186 seat stadium offers the brick backdrop of Wrigley Field, 
                the dark green chainback seats of Camden Yard and the Green Monster 
                of Fenway Park. </p>
              <p> The $1.4 million Jonathan B. Lovelace Athletic Museum and Hall 
                of Honor opened in April of 1996. The interactive, state of the 
                art museum features all Auburn sports and heroes such as Ralph 
                "Shug" Jordan, Heisman Trophy winners Pat Sullivan and Bo Jackson, 
                Charles Barkley, Frank Thomas, Vicki Orr and Harvey Glance. It 
                is designed to honor Auburn's past, define the present and inspire 
                the future. </p>
              <p> The final phase of Auburn's Student Services Center in Sewell 
                Hall has been completed providing Auburn student-athletes with 
                one of the finest resource centers in the nation. Academic support 
                services have been upgraded and a career counseling program added. 
              </p>
              <p> Women's softball became Auburn's 20th varsity sport this year. 
                Plans are underway for a new softball field and a major renovation 
                of Beard-Eaves-Memorial Coliseum to enhance Auburn's basketball 
                and gymnastics programs. </p>
              <p> Auburn's first major marketing and promotion efforts have resulted 
                in record attendance at men's basketball games, and Auburn has 
                been selected to host the NCAA men's golf championship in the 
                year 2000. </p>
              <p> In his two years as Athletic Director, Auburn has won two SEC 
                championships and appeared in post-season competition numerous 
                times. Auburn's program ranked in Top 20 in 1995-96 for overall 
                competitive accomplishment and 16 of Auburn's 19 teams were in 
                postseason competition. </p>
              <p> Housel steadfastly refuses to take credit for any of the progress 
                made during his first two years as Director. "Auburn deserves 
                the credit," he says. "Auburn and Auburn people. None of the things 
                that have happened could have happened without a dedicated staff, 
                a committed group of student-athletes and the loyalty and support 
                of Auburn people down through the years. </p>
              <p> "As Coach Jordan said, it's not the bricks and mortar that make 
                Auburn special. It's Auburn people who make Auburn special and 
                we are seeing that in their support of our program and the young 
                men and women who wear Auburn Orange and Blue." </p>
              <p> Whatever else might be said of David Housel, it must be said 
                that he is an Auburn man. First, last and always, he is an Auburn 
                man. He has dedicated the greater part of his life to the betterment 
                of Auburn. With the exception of a nine-month stint as news editor 
                of The Huntsville News in 1969-70, Housel has been at Auburn for 
                31 years. And in those nine months in Huntsville, he never gave 
                up his post office box in Auburn. </p>
              <p> Housel's first job at Auburn was in the athletic ticket office, 
                where he served as an administrative assistant to Bill Beckwith, 
                himself an Auburn legend. While working in the ticket office, 
                Housel continued his association with athletic director Jeff Beard 
                and Ralph "Shug" Jordan, the head football coach, two Auburn legends 
                and mentors of Housel's "Auburn Man" philosophy. </p>
              <p> When Housel was named athletic director, Beard, retired and 
                living in the Gold Hill community near Auburn, was the first person 
                he visited. The second was Evelyn Jordan, Coach Jordan's widow. 
              </p>
              <p> Housel served as an instructor in Journalism and as Advisor 
                to The Auburn Plainsman from 1972-80 and rejoined the athletic 
                department in 1980 as an Assistant Director of Sports Information. 
                He became Sports Information Director in 1981 when Pat Dye was 
                named Athletic Director, named Assistant Athletic Director in 
                1985 and Director of Athletics in 1994. </p>
              <p> Asked to describe his personal philosophy as Athletic Director, 
                Housel said, "Cliff Hare said it best, 'Athletics make men strong, 
                study makes men wise, and character makes men great.'" </p>
              <p> The 50-year-old Housel has been a member of the NCAA Public 
                Relations and Communications Committees and served as chair of 
                the Communications Committee in 1994. He is a past president of 
                the Southeastern Conference Sports Information Directors and he 
                worked 18 straight NCAA Division I men's Basketball Championships, 
                from 1977 through 1994. He served as a member of the Final Four 
                Media Coordination Committee from 1983 through 1994. </p>
              <p> An award-winning free lance writer, Housel is the author of 
                two books, "Saturdays to Remember" and "From the Desk of David 
                Housel : A Collection of Auburn Stories." A member of Phi Gamma 
                Delta, Omicron Delta Kappa and Sigma Delta Chi, he is also an 
                honorary member of the University Singers and the Auburn Football 
                Lettermen Club. He received the Alabama Chapter of the National 
                Football Foundation's "Contribution to Amateur Football" award 
                in 1984. </p>
              <p> A man for many seasons, Housel's varied interests include a 
                love of Broadway and the theater. He made his Broadway debut July 
                10, 1992, at the Eugene O'Neill Theater in the Cameron Mackintosh 
                production of "Five Guys Named Moe." </p>
              <p> He serves on the NCAA's District III Postgraduate Scholarship 
                Committee and as Chair of the Dean's Council for Auburn's College 
                of Liberal Arts. </p>
              <p> He is married to the former Susan McIntosh, a third grade teacher 
                at Wrights Mill Road Elementary School in Auburn. </p>
