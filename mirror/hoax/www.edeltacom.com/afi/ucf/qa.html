<B>How do you feel about the team's performance in the fall season?</B><br>
<I>"We are not where we were hoping to be. We have a lot of experienced players in the line-up and we were hoping we could come in and hit the ground running. We improved after the first three tournaments, but at the Jerry Pate Intercollegiate, I really felt like we took a step backwards. Luckily, our best performance of the year came in our last outing at the Gary Koch Invitational. That was a very important tournament for us because of all the teams in our district that participated in it. We finished second, and beat all the teams in our district except for one team who is ranked higher than us."</I>
<p>
<B>How are you going to prepare for the spring season?</B><br>
<I>"We are going to do a lot of physical conditioning as a team and we are going to do a lot of individual golf skills work. During the off season is when you get better if you really want to work hard. During the fall season we find out who can play, and in the off-season we find out who wants to play. If the guys that can play are also the guys that want to play, then we are going to have a great team in the spring. But, sometimes not all those who can play want to make the sacrifices that it takes to get better. We are hoping though, that all the guys are going to want to work hard in preparation for the spring."</I>
<p>
<B>What are your goals for the spring season?</B><br>
<I>"This fall we were able to get on the leader board in two out of five events. One of our goals is to be on the leader board in every event we play this spring, and I think we can do that. We would also like to be able to win a few tournaments, as well as defend our Billy Hitchcock title. Every year we want to be able to contend for the SEC Championship, and since we are hosting this year's NCAA Championships, we would love to bring that title home to Auburn as well. I do not know how we will perform in the spring, but I do know that we will be prepared."

<B>What do you learn from your players?</B><br>
<I>"Each player that comes through here brings a wealth of knowledge with him. Probably the most important thing that I learn from them, is about the time one forms an opinion on a generation, you find a young man that will fool you. I think that players today are just as intent on success, and just as gung ho about the game as my generation was, and maybe even further back than that. I have learned not to form a blanket opinion about youngsters."</I>
<p>
<B>What is your favorite course to play on?</B><br>
<I>"That would have to be Augusta National. I can not think of any course that is better than Augusta. I have never been more nervous about teeing off in my life as I was at the number one tee there. I was able to get the club back, but I was not able to swing at the ball!"</I>
<p>
<B>Have you ever hit any hole-in-ones?</B><br>
<I>"Five actually. Two at my home course at the Pine View Country Club. The first was at hole number six, and the next playing with the same group, I hit another one at hole number four. I hit one during a mini-tour professional tournament at Qualye Hollow Country Club in Zeferville, Fla. As a coach at Troy State, I hit two as I was qualifying with my team. One at number four at the Fort Rucker Golf Course and the other at the third hole of the Troy State Country Club. But, most importantly, I hit a double eagle at the number one hole at the former Rolling Hills Country Club in Montgomery."</I>
<p>
<B>What golfer has had the most influence on your life?</B><br>
<I>"My Dad. I would never have taken up the game if it had not been for him. I will always be grateful that he took time out of his schedule to let me follow him around the golf course. I started going with him when I was just a little kid. Not all fathers would have taken the time to do that, but he got the golf hooks in me early. Where I am from in North Clark County, there were only two golf courses in the entire county back then. It was not a very popular sport around there. I grew up in the heart of fishing and hunting country. On the professional level, if you followed golf in my day, you followed Arnold Palmer. I have had the privilege of meeting him several times, and there is no one else like him. I think he has more integrity and charisma than any other athlete, and is a great role model for youngsters today."</I>
