<P>Auburn plays its final non-conference game, hosting the University of Central Florida. The game will mark the 86th observance of Homecoming at Auburn and the 72nd Homecoming football game. 
<p><B>Homecoming on the Plains</B>
<p>Homecoming at Auburn began in June 1913, when Dr. Charles Thach, president of what was then Alabama Polytechnic Institute, issued a proclamation calling for "the observance of a Homecoming for all those loyal sons who, as former Auburn students, have passed through her portals and received her honors."
<p>Homecoming festivities were held in connection with the spring commencement exercises until 1924. Auburn beat Clemson, 13-0, in Auburn's first Homecoming game. The game was played on old Drake Field, which is now the parking lot for Haley Center.
<p>Until the first section of Jordan-Hare Stadium was completed in 1939, Auburn sometimes observed Homecoming in Montgomery or Columbus, Ga., since adequate campus facilities were not available. Auburn did not have Homecoming games in 1930 and 1938. There was no football team in 1943 because of WWII.
<p>Auburn is 59-8-5 at Homecoming. Mississippi State (16 times) has been the most common Homecoming guest.

At halftime of today's game, the Homecoming Queen will be crowned on the east side of the field. A pool of over 50 applicants went through two rounds of interviews and cuts before the five finalists were announced.
The queen was elected by a vote of the Auburn student body on Thursday, Nov. 4 and the winner's name has been kept in anonymity until the announcement.
<p>
Among the five finalists are: Katie Day (chemical engineering, Marietta, GA), Jenny Evans (microbiology, Auburn, AL), Lindsey McCraney (animal and dairy pre-veterinary medicine, Atlanta, GA), Amy Priest (finance, Anchorage, AK), and Selwyn Stewart (nutrition dietetics, Quitman, LA).
<p>All applicants must be an undergraduate with senior status and maintain a grade point average of 2.5 or better. Each applicant was also nominated by a member of one of the 300 campus organizations.
<p>This year's Director's of Homecoming are Stacy Haisten and Sarah Krist, with Holly Skievaski serving as Director of Elections.
<p><B>Auburn Homecoming Notables</B>
<p>This marks the second consecutive year that Auburn will play UCF on Homecoming ... Auburn has won seven straight Homecoming contests ... The Tigers' average margin of victory in those seven games is +18.7 (34.7-16.0) ... Auburn is 22-2-1 in its last 25 Homecoming games ... UCF joins Mississippi State ('55, '56) and Northeast Louisiana ('95, '96) as the only opponents to play Auburn in back-to-back Homecoming games in the last 50 years. 
<p><B>Tuberville in Homecoming Games</B>
<p>Tommy Tuberville is 3-1 as a head coach in Homecoming games. While at Ole Miss, Tuberville defeated Vanderbilt in 1995 (21-10) and 1997 (15-3) and Arkansas State in 1998 (30-17). His lone Homecoming loss was a 39-7 defeat to LSU in 1996.
<p><B>Remembering UCF</B>
<p>Last year's Homecoming game with UCF was a nail biter. Wide receiver Karsten Bailey scored on a 58-yard pass play from Gabe Gross with 57 seconds left to lead Auburn to a 10-6 win.
The Golden Knights appeared to be headed to victory late in the game. With possession of the ball at the Auburn 29-yard line with 1:43 remaining, UCF quarterback Daunte Culpepper fumbled the snap. Tiger defensive end Whit Smith recovered the ball, setting up the Tigers' game-winning score. 
<p><B>Tuberville Versus Non-Conference Opponents</B>
<p>Tommy Tuberville is 15-0 (2-0 at Auburn) as a head coach versus non-conference opponents. Tuberville won all 13 non-conference games at Ole Miss, including a 34-31 win over Marshall in the 1997 Motor City Bowl.
<p><B>Out of Conference</B>
<p>Auburn has won 24 of the last 25 regular-season, non-conference games dating back to 1991. Auburn is 2-0 against non-SEC teams this season, with wins over Appalachian State and Idaho.
<p><B>Auburn vs. Independents</B>
<p>Auburn has an all-time record of 17-2-1 against teams without a current conference affiliation. The Tigers have a 15-0-1 mark at home against independents. UCF is an independent.
<p><B>Heath Hauls in Career Day</B>
<p>Sophomore fullback Heath Evans had a career day against Arkansas, with 68 yards on 15 carries and one touchdown--all in the second half.
His 68 yards were one yard shy of his career total entering the game. In 12 previous games in an Auburn uniform, Evans had 69 yards on 30 attempts.
Evan's rushing touchdown in the fourth quarter was Auburn's first rushing touchdown since Clifton Robinson's rushing touchdown in the LSU game.
<p><B>President Lincoln</B>
<p>Junior linebacker Alex Lincoln had a career day last Saturday at Arkansas. Lincoln recorded a career-high and team season-high 15 tackles (9 T, 6 A). He also had one tackle for loss.
With a team-leading 73 tackles, Lincoln has posted 46 stops (12 per game) over the last four contests. His 15 against the Razorbacks come on the heals of a 12-tackle effort against Florida.
Lincoln has totalled double-digit tackles against LSU (11), Tennessee (10), Florida (12), and Arkansas (15).
