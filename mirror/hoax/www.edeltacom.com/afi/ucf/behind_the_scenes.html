<P>His day begins with the rising of the sun. It is filled with film watching, meetings, and practice. Many late nights you can find the Mt. Vernon, Wash., native, alone in his office with only the sounds of the VCR tape heads in the background, busy playing again and again the defensive formations of the Tigers' next opponent. And as the day ends close to the arrival of the next, so goes the life of Auburn Offensive Coordinator Noel Mazzone. 
<P>Unlike most of his peers, Mazzone did not aspire to be a football coach. He graduated from the University of New Mexico in 1980 with a degree in architecture and dreams of commercial design. 
After the completion of a stellar college career, the former quarterback and All-Western Athletic Conference selection became a graduate assistant for his alma mater while working towards a master's degree. But, one phone call changed the path his life would take. 
<P>In 1981, at the conclusion of his first year as a high school assistant at Boulder High School, Mazzone received a phone call from his former Raton High School coach, Rick Johnson. 
"Rick called and asked if I wanted to join him at Colorado State. It was an offer I could not refuse."
Thus began Noel Mazzone's collegiate coaching career.
<P>After five seasons (1982-86) as the Rams quarterbacks and receivers coach, Mazzone, wanted by TCU to implement a stronger passing game, became the quarterback coach for the Horned Frogs. 
While at the Fort Worth, Texas school, Coach Mazzone met future Auburn coaches Hugh Nall, Greg Knox, and Joe Pannunzio. In 1992, after five years with Texas Christian, Mazzone joined the staff at the University of Minnesota as the quarterback coach.
<P>At the end of the Golden Gophers 1994 campaign, then Texas A&M defensive coordinator Tommy Tuberville inquired of Coach Mazzone's possible interest in a job at Ole Miss. 
He didn't have to think twice. 
<P>The move to Oxford gave Mazzone his first coordinator job, and from 1995-98, Mazzone was reunited with Nall, Pannunzio, and Knox as the Rebels offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. And the rest, as they say, is history.
<P>While his job description includes numerous hours in the office and on the practice field, Mazzone spends any free time he has with his family.
<P>While in school at New Mexico, Mazzone met his wife, Patricia, in Gunison, Colo., where both of their parents had recently moved. Ironically, when they met, neither knew that each was enrolled at UNM.
A father of three, Taylor, 11, Grayson, eight, and Alexandra, six, cherishes any time he can spend with the trio.
"We do typical family stuff, like fishing and golfing."
<P>Though Taylor is already following in his father's footsteps, Mazzone would not mind if his boys did not play the game that has meant so much to their father. 
<P>According to Mazzone, "the kids can play any sport or do anything that they want, as long as they remain active."
A year has passed since the Mazzones moved to Auburn. And while the family of five has not quite settled into their new home, the "Loveliest Village on the Plains" has left a shining impression upon them.
<P>"The Auburn fans have really impressed me the most. Their intensity, and dedication to this university and the football program is unsurpassed."
