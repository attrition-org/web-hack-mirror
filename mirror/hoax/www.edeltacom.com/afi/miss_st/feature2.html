<P>When a student-athlete enters the world of collegiate sports, the dreams are endless, the expectations are high and the possibilities are always there. In the beginning it seems as if the time and years will last forever, and there will always be next year to achieve the goals that weren't quite made the year before.
<P>For the 1999-2000 senior swim class, the time is closing for nine senior leaders. It was during their career at Auburn that the program was elevated to new heights.  Countless hours in the pool and in the classroom just to represent Auburn they best way they knew how, was, and is the continuing focus of Auburn swimmers and divers.    
<P>"The biggest thing I have learned from being an Auburn swimmer is how to discipline myself," All-American Cathy Sursi said. "It was not like we had a lot of free time and you had to decide what your priorities were.
<P>"The thing I have gained most from being here at Auburn is the friendships, discipline and time management," All-American Annemieke McReynolds said. "I also learned what sacrifice means. It was tough, but it pays off in the end."
It is easy to want to be better and to discipline yourself when you have support.  
<P>"I have always had a feeling of belonging here at Auburn. I am in denial right now that this is my last year," Rada Owen said.  "We are one huge family and the way we mesh together is unbelievable. There is such comradery here, like nothing I have ever experienced. I have friends at other schools who envy what we have here."
<P>Carter Hull can vouch for being one of those other swimmers from another school who witnessed the chemistry at Auburn. Hull, a Charlotte, N.C. native, transferred to Auburn from Alabama after his sophomore year. 
<P>"The biggest reason I wanted to transfer to Auburn was I noticed how they were so team oriented. I would talk to Aaron (Ciarla) and he would talk about the closeness at Auburn and how he won a national championship his freshman year," Hull said.
<P>Another senior, Tim Russell knows that feeling. Russell was on the verge of quitting following his sophomore year, but then he realized what being apart of a close team meant to him.
<P>"My time here has gone by really fast and it has meant a lot to me. Fortunately, David (Marsh) let me come back and the reason I did want to come back was because of the team," Russell said.     
<P>Some say they can feel the eyes upon them when the team walks in at championship meets. Many can sense the unity within the team. One answer that repeated itself over and over was how close the team was and how it was a family.
<P>"Since I have been here at Auburn my sense of family has grown and I come from a strong family. We are like one big unit and I think that is what helps us win," three-time SEC 100-fly champion Mimi Bowen said. "I would advise the underclassmen to keep their love for Auburn. Always have that desire to improve Auburn."
<P>"Being at Auburn has been such a great experience, especially team-wise," All-American Katie Ryan said.  "I never imagined my career would have turned out like it did. I learned what it was like to have goals."
<P>Together, the Auburn swimming and diving teams do everything from rafting trips to international meets. It is not often that you would see one swimmer without another.  
<P>"We have a lot of fun together, but hard work pays off and it is a good thing. I hope that our senior class can be a standard that the others will look upon," NCAA 50 free champion Aaron Ciarla said. 
<P>The goal of Auburn teachers and coaches is to turn out the best people possible. It can go unsaid that these student-athletes appreciate the efforts and want to give back in whatever way possible.
<P>"I learned what is really important is maintaining friendships and family relations. Being at Auburn has helped me figure out who I am and learn what my limits are," Mobile native, Matt Busbee said. "After I leave Auburn I want to represent what an AU person is by my character and my actions.
