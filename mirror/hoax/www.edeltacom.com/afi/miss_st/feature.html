<P>During the season, an Auburn football player has very little free time. Beginning bright and early in the morning and concluding well after dark, his day is filled with activity. Class, practice, weights, treatments, meetings, and homework - just a few things that a player endures day-to-day during the season. 
<P>Junior linebacker Alex Lincoln took time out to give a behind the scenes look at the "day in the life" of an Auburn football player. Lincoln charts his day, on the Wednesday prior to the Tennessee game. 
<P>8:00 am - Time to wake up and get ready for another day on the Plains.
<P>8:12 am - There's no time for breakfast this morning, so I hop in the shower.
<P>9:05 am - After getting dressed, I make a short call to mom to check-in and say hi before heading to class.
<P>9:30 am - Arrive at Haley Center for Health Administration and Regulation with Professor McEldowney.
<P>11:00 am - When finished discussing how to change the HMO and health insurance world as we know it, I walk to Foy Union with friends Erin and Star for an hour break with a Powerade and some chips.     
<P>12:10 pm - Stroll down the concourse, back to Haley Center for Spanish 102.
<P>12:20 pm - Brook, my Spanish GTA, cancels class. A little change in the routine! So I decide to head home for some rest and a little ESPN.
<P>1:55 pm - Time for a lite lunch at Burger King-- A double whopper combo, chicken sandwich, and a cheeseburger.
<P>2:19 pm - Arrive at the Athletic Complex to dress and get taped.
<P>3:15 pm - Kick-off team meeting with Coach Pannunzio where we discuss how Tennessee could possibly block us down field, and how to keep the Vols from making any large returns.
<P>3:30 pm - Meet with Coach Whitt and fellow linebackers to watch game film, discuss existing defensive plan and any changes we might make.
<P>4:20 pm - On the practice field for stretching with Coach Yoxall, our strength and conditioning coach.
<P>6:30 pm - Wednesday practice days are the last real work day of the week. Coach Tuberville, his staff, and my teammates spend the two and a half  hours implementing this week's game plan. It was a good, solid practice.
<P>6:52 pm - The quizzing media await upstairs as the media relations office is the last stop of the day. Six members of the state's media want to know how the Tiger defense will handle Tee Martin. Sunday through Thursday, the media are there to find out the latest news of the Auburn football team.
<P>8:10 pm - Dinner Time! Usually eat out with a group, tonight Outback is the choice. We split a couple of appetizers. For my entree - ribeye.
<P>9:00 pm - Time to attend the weekly meeting of Fellowship of Christian Athletes in the Athletic Complex auditorium.
<P>9:55 pm - Finally home again. Time to hangout with my roommates - brother Tracy and Zack, a friend of mine from home. Another friend of ours, Stephanie, comes over to visit. It's always nice to get to spend time with my friends because my schedule doesn't allow for a whole lot of social time.
<P>10:22 pm - Tracy and Zack are enthralled with Play Station. I don't play because I get too frustrated and would wind-up throwing the controller across the room. Homework is calling my name, I have to be prepared for health finance and Spanish tomorrow.
<P>11:18 pm - Try to be in bed by 11, but I didn't quite make it tonight. Slip in a metrix shake for a late night snack, before I hit the pillow.
<P>11:30 pm - Lights out. Hope to get a good night's rest as I'll be up again early tomorrow for another hectic day.
