<P>Auburn hosts the 14th-ranked Mississippi State Bulldogs in its second SEC home game of the 1999 season. The game is being televised regionally by Jefferson Pilot.
<P><B>Tigers' Fourth-Longest Rivalry</B>
<BR>Prior to this season, Auburn and Mississippi State have met 73 times, with the Tigers holding a 51-20-2 advantage. The series between the schools is the fourth longest in Auburn's history. Only Georgia (102), Georgia Tech (90), and Florida (75) have played the Tigers more times.  
Auburn has also defeated the Bulldogs more than any other school it has played.  Auburn's 51 wins over Mississippi State is three more than its 48 wins over Georgia, and four more than its 47 wins over Georgia Tech.
<P><B>Tigers' SEC Games Equals TV Time</B>
<BR>This marks Auburn's fourth consecutive SEC game this season to be televised.  Dating back to the 1995 season, 30 of the Tigers last 32 conference games have been nationally or regionally televised.
<P><B>Tommy Versus the Bulldogs</B>
<BR>Auburn head coach Tommy Tuberville owns a 2-2 all-time mark versus Mississippi State. Tuberville has had success in odd years, defeating the Bulldogs in 1995, and 1997.
In those four games, Tuberville's teams have held Mississippi State to 17.3 points per game.
<P><B>Crayton Goes Crazy</B>
<BR>Junior cornerback Rodney Crayton had his best day in a Tiger uniform against Tennessee, coming up with a career-high 14 tackles, including a tackle for loss and a pass broken up.  
Crayton nearly had an interception in the fourth quarter, but it was ruled a trap.
After an injury-plagued career prior to this season, Crayton is having a career-type year in 1999. Crayton currently is third on the team in tackles with 35. His 14 tackles against Tennessee were just four shy of his total output in 16 games during the 1996 and 1998 seasons.
The Dadeville, Ala., native also has broken up a team-best eight passes and has two interceptions and two tackles for loss.
Crayton missed the entire 1997 and part of the 1998 seasons with knee injuries.  As a freshman in 1996, Crayton missed four games with an ankle injury.
<P><B>Fields Named to Good Works Team</B>
<BR>Senior linebacker Haven Fields has been named to the American Football Coaches Association Good Works Team for 1999.  The team honors those student-athletes who show exceptional dedication to community service and to the betterment of the communities in which they live.
A Miami, Fla., native, Fields has participated in several community service related activities in the Auburn area. He frequently speaks at area elementary schools about the importance of education and the dangers of drugs and alcohol.
He also has been active in the Cultural Enrichment and Education Program. The program includes talking to high school students about the important topics in their lives. Fields has also served as a camp counselor at youth retreats in the state and is a speaker at the Auburn University Freshman Orientation Program.
Nominees had to be involved and committed to working with a charitable organization, service group or other community service activities. Candidates had to display sincere concern and reliability, and also have made a favorable impression on the organizations that they were involved. 
<P><B>Safe Haven</B>
<BR>Leading the Tigers in tackles with 45 stops, senior Haven Fields is just seven tackles shy of equalling last season's tackle performance in 11 games.  
He has led the team in tackles in three games this season and has had at least nine tackles in four games.  
His eight tackles for loss also lead the team and are three more than his total in the previous three years combined. They also equal the team high of eight tackles for loss recorded by Leonardo Carson last year.
<P><B>Pick Parade</B>
<BR>The Auburn defense has already collected 12 interceptions this year and are on pace to collect 26, which would be the second-most in school history. The school record for interceptions in a season is 34 during the 1969 season.  
The most interceptions a team in the 1990's has had is 22 by the 1994 and 1996 teams.
<P><B>Auburn-Mississippi St. Series Notes</B>
<BR>Saturday's meeting between the two schools will mark the 54th consecutive year that the two schools have played each other.  Since 1943, Auburn owns a 34-17-2 advantage over the Bulldogs ... Auburn  has never lost to Mississippi State in two consecutive meetings on the Plains ... Auburn holds a 5-4 advantage in the 1990's ... The two teams have split four games in Auburn during the 1990's ... The winner in four of the last five games has scored 38 points or more ... Auburn and Mississippi State were the SEC Western Division representatives at the SEC Championship game the last two years ... Just eight games in the last 30 years have been decided by seven points or less ... The winner in the last six contests has won by 14 points or more É Only Virginia (1998) and Miss.

<P><B>Interception Streak</B>
