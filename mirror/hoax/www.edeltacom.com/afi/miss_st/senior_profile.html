<P>As tourists packed beach chairs and coolers into their station wagons and headed to the miracle mile of white sand beaches of Sarasota, Fla., a pair of brothers prepared to play their first little league game in the city that they called home.
<P>Looking almost identical, with the same size, same weight, and same facial features, Kenny and Eric Kelly used the panhandle of Florida as their own personal playground. Avid little league players as school children, the pair were only separated by 11 months, causing much confusion among their elders about who was who.
<P>For the record, Eric was the older brother, but both shared the same grade in school. In their formative years, the two were always together and decided at the same time, 11th grade, that they wanted to give football a try, again. By now, the Kelly family had moved to Panama City and the brothers both went out for the Bay High School team.
<P>Fast forward five years and the pair are still playing football, although they are separated by nearly 550 miles. Kenny is the starter at Auburn's whip position, a position that combines his size and speed. Eric, an inch shorter and 10 pounds lighter and a year behind Kenny in school thanks to a redshirt season, plays cornerback for Kentucky.
<P>"I would like for us to play against each other in college," Eric said. "Growing up, we were inseparable, but we went our separate ways for college."
<P>Kenny and Eric's paths, that were woven so tightly together in their first 18 years, unraveled after high school. Kenny chose to go to junior college at East Central Mississippi where he was an All-America selection as a sophomore linebacker. His love of the position was one of the reasons he chose to come to Auburn.
<P>"I knew Takeo Spikes and Ricky Neal were leaving," Kelly said. "I thought I had a chance to come in and play early. Also, Auburn was close to my home in Panama City and I wanted to play football in the SEC."
<P>As Kelly strapped on his shoulder pads and laced up his cleats for his first Auburn practices, he found himself reporting to a new position in the secondary. Packing just over 200 pounds on a 6'0" frame, Kelly's size was considered to be too small for the inside linebacker position. 
<P>But midway through the season, Auburn needed a pass rusher and Kelly fit the bill with 4.5 speed coming off the corner. He ended up playing in all 11 games last season, starting one as a hybrid linebacker. 
<P>This season, he has been a permanent fixture at whip, which is a combination of linebacker and safety. He is fourth on the team with 28 tackles and he has also collected two interceptions and one sack for the Tigers. In just two seasons, he is quickly making a name for himself.
<P>As his name has started to become more well-known, some of the same old identity issues resurfaced. But now, he had to fight a completely different battle, one where he shared the same name with another popular college athlete, quarterback Kenny Kelly of the University of Miami.
<P>"It's weird to hear your own name on television when they aren't talking about you," Kenny said. "One time, somebody thought it was me when they heard the stats for Miami, but most of the people who know me think it is funny."
<P>As for the other Kelly brother, Eric has started at cornerback for Kentucky for the last two seasons. Both brothers would like to play in the NFL, which would give them a chance to be together once again.
<P>"One day if the opportunity presents itself, I would like to be able to play together again," Eric said.
<P>For now, both brothers will concentrate on their remainders of their college careers. But each remembers and relishes the days of little league games played in the hot, humid air on a sandy lot in Sarasota.
