<P>It's a hot summer afternoon and all of a sudden the entire athletic complex starts to shake. It's not an earthquake, but the Auburn football players working out in the newly renovated weight room. As hundreds of pounds of weights fall to the floor of the weight room, the people in the offices above and below try to continue to work as everything around them rattles.
<P>This weight dropping regimen was one of the new tools in Auburn's summer conditioning program run by Head Strength and Conditioning Coach Kevin Yoxall and Conditioning Coach Phillip Lolley. Together, they ensure that the Auburn players will be ready to play four quarters of football and achieve success on the field.

<P>Changes made to Auburn's conditioning program are evident as soon as you walk through the doors of the weight room. The facility is now more functional and suited to help the athletes be the best in their respective areas.
<P>"All the equipment is virtually brand new," Yoxall said. "We are able to get more athletes in now to work out at a quick and even pace. The major thing is that the room is very functional."
Another change to the weight room that was not planned by either Yoxall or Lolley was the removal of the lists of the top players in different strength areas. The back wall that had the lists of top players on it fell down while no one was around.
<P>"The records were nice for motivation and to look at," Yoxall said. "But how do these lists really help the football players? The real test will be when the players actually perform in a game."
Neither Yoxall or Lolley feel that they have made drastic impacts on the program yet. Only time will tell what kind of difference they have made.
<P>"I am only a small part of a big puzzle," Lolley said. "My job is to assist Coach Yoxall in any way possible and elevate problems."
<P>"I don't think I've had as big an impact as people say," Yoxall said. "It takes two to four years to have an impact and instill a certain work ethic."
<P>The Auburn players have a different opinion, though, on the strides made by Yoxall and Lolley. They have been working harder than ever.
<P>"The players respect Coach Yoxall and Coach Lolley," senior Quinton Reese said. "They push us just like a teammate would. No matter how you feel you have to go as hard as possible."

<P>Auburn's off-season conditioning has focused on speed and power. Workouts consist of Olympic-style exercises such as power-lifting that help the players to become physically dominating. The results of Auburn's conditioning will be seen once they step out onto the field.
<P>Yoxall competed in power-lifting on the side but did not intend to be a strength and conditioning coach. He graduated with a degree in Special Education from East Texas State University in 1983. Later he accepted a graduate assistant coaching job at Texas Christian University in order to work on his master's degree in Special Education.
<P>Instead the doors opened for him into coaching. After he left TCU in 1992, Yoxall went to Minnesota, then UCLA before arriving at Auburn this past January.
<P>Lolley's path through the profession is the opposite of Yoxall's, as he has always focused on athletics and coaching. He played sports throughout his life and wanted to continue working with people, so he got into coaching. A native of Butler, Alabama, Lolley graduated with a degree in Health, Physical Education, and Recreation from Livingston University in 1981 and then began his coaching career at South Choctaw Academy. At one time Lolley was the youngest football head coach in the state of Alabama. He too came to Auburn this past January after serving as head coach at North Jackson High School for 11 years.
<P>So if you happen to be in the athletic complex and the building starts to shake, don't worry. Rest assured, Coach Yoxall and Coach Lolley are helping the Auburn football players to achieve success through their conditioning program.
