<P>It has been a long and winding road for the college football career of Auburn senior Jack Schwieger. His resume at Auburn is brief-seven games, six catches, and 76 yards.
<P>After transferring to the Plains in February of 1998, the Chicago, Ill., native's first season at Auburn may not have been as lovely as he had expected. Not only did the team struggle to a 3-8 record, but just seven games into his career as a Tiger, he broke his arm against Louisiana Tech.
<P>"Breaking my arm was probably the roughest part of my life. As a football player you want to be on the field," Schwieger said. "If your arm is broken in half or even if you have no arms you still want to be on the field playing. I was just dying watching the Alabama game on the sideline."
<P>With the first snap today Schwieger will have put everything from last year completely behind him and will be focused on this season and achieving the goals that he set for himself and the team.
<P>"As an individual I would love to get back into the starting position," said the 23 year-old Schwieger. "As a team I am looking for us to do a lot better, and if the individual accomplishments come that's great, but I would rather have the team goals reached."
<P>Schwieger has already earned the respect from his coaches and is looked at to be a leader for the upcoming season.
<P>"First off he is a great kid, and he helps out the whole team. He is an older player who brings leadership to us and is a great receiver down the field," said tight ends coach Joe Pannunzio. "He is like the rest of these kids out here, he paid a price in the off-season and is looking to get this program back to where it belongs and that is ranked in the top 10 or top 15 every season."
<P>The beginning and the middle of the football road for Schwieger are not easy to follow, however he has had some interesting stops along the way. His career started in 1993 at Illinois State where he played for one season. Following his stop in Bloomington, Ill. he took a two-year hiatus to fulfill a Mormon mission in Australia then played at Snow Junior College in Utah for a year.

<P>"The trip put a lot of things into perspective for my life," said Schwieger. "As a high school kid football is everything. Then you go away on your mission, you see things, you learn a whole lot about life and a whole lot about yourself."
<P>Even though he was away from the grueling life of a college football player, Schwieger could not escape from thoughts about the game.
<P>"I thought about football a whole lot while I was gone," said Schwieger. "They were building a team while I was over there so I got the opportunity to help coach a few guys. Most of them had no idea what football was, all they had done was watch it on TV. I got to help them with fundamentals and the basics so it kept me in the game while I was gone."
<P>After the year in Utah the road stopped in Auburn for Schwieger. And if everything goes as plans, the road will end here for a good amount of time.
<P>"I fell in love with Auburn as soon as I came here. I am definitely going to go to graduate school and I will be doing it at Auburn," said the health promotions major.
