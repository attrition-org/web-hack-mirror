<P>Today will mark the beginning of the Tommy Tuberville era at Auburn. Named Auburn's 25th head coach last November, Tuberville and his staff have looked forward to this day for nine months. And today is here.
<P>Tuberville knows a thing or two about success.
<P>He has been part of three national championships as an assistant at Miami and even more impressive is the work he did at Ole Miss. Inheriting a plagued program in Oxford stricken by NCAA sanctions and probation, Tuberville posted a winning record in four seasons, guiding the Rebels to two bowl games. Due to the NCAA sanctions. Ole Miss never had a full complement of scholarships during his tenure.
<P>In season openers as a head coach, Tuberville is 3-1. Tuberville will look to follow suit of his predecessors in their first game at Auburn. Since World War II, six of the seven Auburn coaches won their first game including Carl Voyles, Earl Brown, Shug Jordan, Pat Dye, Terry Bowden, and Bill Oliver. In all, Auburn's 24 previous coaches have compiled a 15-8-1 mark in their first game as Auburn's leader.
<P>&nbsp;
<P><B>New "Old" Look</B>
<P>One subtle change made by Tuberville this season is the move back to the traditional uniforms of seasons past. Gone from the uniforms is the orange drop shadows that were added two years ago. Also gone is the Tiger Eyes logo that was present on the pants last season.
The traditional block lettering that was used in the endzones of Jordan-Hare Stadium were removed last season and replaced with the script Auburn Tigers logo. Out with the new and in with the old, as the block Auburn and Tigers lettering will return to the endzones of Jordan-Hare this season.
<P>&nbsp;<P><B>Searels Sounds Familiar</B>
<P>A familiar face will be patrolling the sidelines today for Appalachian State. Former Auburn All-American Stacy Searels is currently in his sixth year as the offensive line coach for the Mountaineers. A native of Trion, Ga., Searels was an offensive lineman at Auburn from 1984-87 and was a first-team All-America as a senior. That season, Searels was also named the Lineman of the Year by the Atlanta Touchdown Club.
Following a three-year stint in the NFL and one year in the WLAF, Searels began his coaching career on the Plains as a graduate assistant offensive line and special teams coach in the early 1990's. Searels earned his undergraduate and graduate degree from Auburn, and his wife Patricia, is also an Auburn graduate and previously worked as an academic advisor in the athletic department.
<P>&nbsp;<P><B>1989 SEC Champs Recognized</B>
<P>Prior to today's game, the 1989 Southeastern Conference champion Auburn Tiger football team will be recognized. Under Pat Dye's leadership, Auburn won its fourth consecutive SEC Championship while posting a 10-2 record including a 6-1 mark in the conference and a 31-14 win over Ohio State in the Hall of Fame Bowl.
<P>Despite the SEC title, bowl victory and No. 6 finish in the national rankings, it was the second-to-last game of the season that will be etched in the memories of Tiger fans forever. On Dec. 2, 1989, Auburn hosted Alabama in Jordan-Hare Stadium for the first time in the two school's historic rivalry. The Tide came into the game with a 10-0 record and a No. 2 ranking. Before a Jordan-Hare Stadium record crowd of 85,319, the Tigers ended Alabama's national title hopes with a monumental 30-20 victory.
<P>Among those present today from the 1989 team include: Pedro Cherry, Darrel Crawford, Stacy Danley, Dale Overton, Quentin Riggins, Frankie Stankunas, Shayne Wasden, and Stan White.
