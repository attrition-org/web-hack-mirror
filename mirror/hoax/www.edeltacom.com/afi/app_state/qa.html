<P><B>What are your overall thoughts on the upcoming volleyball season?</B>
<BR><I>"In my six years at Auburn as an assistant and as head coach, I am most excited about this team because athletically this is probably the most talented squad I have seen here. This team has a lot of potential and is one of the deepest we've had since I've been at Auburn. We are in a situation where we have people in practice everyday and competition for positions will be challenged. I feel this year we have a good opportunity to get into the NCAA Tournament with this team."</I>

<P><B>What are your thoughts on the schedule?</B>
<BR><I>"On the high end this is one of the toughest schedules Auburn has ever played. We will get a lot of exposure to some tough teams. Our non-conference schedule will give us a good measure early in the season where we stand. We are somewhat an experienced team, but we have a lot of newcomers. There is a good corps of starters returning but six out of 14 on our roster have never competed for Auburn University. Three of those newcomers have been here training with us but they have yet to play in a game situation. During our early season we will see how well the newcomers gel with the competitive environment of the returners. As for our SEC schedule, I believe each team will start off at least where they were last year and I think the Western Division will make some strides and be more competitive. In the past the East has been the dominant division but I believe the West has gotten stronger and is closing the gap between the variety of strengths."</I>




<P><B>On number of home games this season:</B>
<BR><I>"Last year we were on the road five straight weekends so hopefully this year's schedule will be a little more friendly to us. Including our tournament we are hosting, we will have 15 home matches this year. We will have an opportunity to travel a little and see good competition, but we will also host some good teams here on our home turf. We will also host three preseason ranked teams in Cal-State Santa Barbara, Florida, and Arkansas."</I>

<BR><I>"Vail, Colorado."</I>

<P><B>What are your plans for celebrating New Year's Eve 1999? </B>
<BR><I>"Originally, I was going on a Millennium Cruise but I am having trouble finding availability so I may end up snowboarding in Vail."</I>

<P><B>What was your most memorable moment of your first year as head coach? </B>
<BR><I>"Beating a Top 25 program on their home court."</I>

<P><B>If you could choose three golfers to play with on a team, who would you choose? </B>
<BR><I>"Gene Sarazin because he is from my hometown, Jack Nicklaus because he is Jack Nicklaus and Layne Savoie because he is an Auburn alum and he knows how to straighten my swing."</I>

<P><B>Which Superhero best personifies you? </B>
<BR><I>"Hong Kong Phooey because he always got the job done even though sometimes he didn't know he did."</I>

<P><B>If a movie was made about you, who would play you? </B>
<BR><I>"Either David Spade or Dana Carvey because they can make a joke out of any situation."</I>

<P><B>If you could have any job regardless of money, fame or location, what would it be? </B>
<BR><I>"I would have two. In the summer I would be a golf coach at the University of The Virgin Islands and in the winter I would be the Director of Winter Operations at Vail."</I>
