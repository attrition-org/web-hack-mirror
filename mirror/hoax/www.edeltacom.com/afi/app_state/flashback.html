<P>Emotions were running high for the Auburn Tigers as they entered the 1990 Hall of Fame Bowl in Tampa, Fla., against Ohio State.
<P>The Tigers came into the game with a 9-2 mark, their third-consecutive SEC Championship and had just recorded a solid 30-20 victory over arch-rival Alabama in the teams' first meeting at Jordan-Hare Stadium.
<P>Auburn's high emotions led the ninth-ranked squad to a sluggish start against the underdog Buckeyes, ranked 21st in the nation.
<P>Ohio State scored on its second possession to take a first quarter lead of 7-0 on a one-yard touchdown off left tackle by tailback Carlos Snow. Auburn added a 19-yard field goal by placekicker Win Lyle to cut the deficit to 7-3.
<P>The Big 10 power increased its lead to 11 early in the second quarter when split end Brian Stablein caught a nine-yard touchdown pass from Buckeye quarterback Greg Frey, to make it 14-3.
<P>On the Tigers insuing possession, tailback Stacy Danley took a vicious hit compliments of Buckeye strong safety Zack Dumas. The hit on Danley occurred with 13:48 remaining in the second quarter on an attempted swing pass from Auburn quarterback Reggie Slack to Danley.
<P>"My best friend (Slack) hung me out to dry," Danley said. "Dumas had a 10-yard head start and just unloaded on me. What made it look worse than it really was, was that it blindsided me and caught me off guard."




<P>Though some players called the hit on Danley a turning point, the nerves of Slack still showed as he threw a pair of interceptions on the next two Tiger possessions.
<P>"We were playing flat at the time, and we needed something to wake us up and get us in the game," Danley added. "You always hear about taking one for the team, and I guess that is what I did. But you don't want to take too many hits like that." The Tigers avoided further damage as they held the Buckeyes to a pair of punts following the Slack interceptions. Needing another spark before the half ended, Auburn received one when Shayne Wasden returned a punt 34 yards to Ohio State's 33-yard line giving the Tigers 48 seconds to score.

<P>"I've been put in those situations, and I've been able to come up with a big play," Wasden said of his Hall of Fame Bowl punt return.
<P>The Tigers did not waste the nice field position, as Slack regained his composure and used 37 seconds to lead the Tigers into the endzone. The senior quarterback threw an 11-yard scoring strike to Greg Taylor as the clock ticked down in the half. Taylor's touchdown cut the Buckeye lead to four at the half, 14-10.
<P>Auburn kept the momentum from their late first-half touchdown drive as they scored on its first three possessions of the second half.
<P>Slack hooked up with Taylor for the second time to start the second-half scoring and give the Tigers the lead for good at 17-14. Slack capped off a 16-play, 80-yard drive on Auburn's next possession with a five-yard scramble up the middle to give the Tigers a 14-point cushion.
<P>The Tigers ended the Hall of Fame Bowl scoring with Slack's third touchdown pass of the game, a two-yard pass to Herbert Casey giving the SEC Champions a 31-14 lead.  Defensively, the Tigers rebounded from a slow first-half start, to shut the Buckeyes out of the scoring column in the second half and hold the Buckeyes to a total of 66 yards rushing for the game.
<P>Slack's three touchdown, 141-yard aerial attack and one rushing touchdown earned him the game's MVP honors, as he completed 16-of-22 passes. Danley gained 89 rushing yards on 20 carries to lead the Tigers rushing attack. Inside linebacker Quentin Riggins recorded a team-high nine tackles and had one interception.
