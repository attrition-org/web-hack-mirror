<P>The contrast was startling.<P>
Propped up in bed was a child of about nine years old. His diminutive frame was hardly recognizable in the sheets that covered him. He donned a hat to hide his balding head, but underneath a large grin was forming at the corners of his mouth.
Next to his bed stood three football players. The trio, including two offensive linemen, looked huge in the small room and even bigger next to the small child.
"Are you an Auburn football fan?" asked one of the giants as he hovered over the bed.<P>
"Heck no, I'm an Alabama fan," the child said with a large smile that lit up his small face.<P>
Ah, the defiance of youth. Even in this hospital, a kid full of bravado can laugh after telling someone five times his size that he will never, ever root for him.
The football players also laughed. After all, the answer hadn't really mattered. What did matter, was that the four were able to share and enjoy the time together. And hopefully, the child was able to forget for a moment why he was here in this place, far away from playgrounds, bicycles, swimming pools and other favorite summer past times. That is why the football players had come, to help these kids laugh and forget.<P>
Cole Cubelic, Auburn's senior center, arranged the trip and had recruited fellow offensive linemen Mike Pucillo and Kendall Simmons along with defensive back Rodney Crayton and linebacker Alex Lincoln to join him. On a Wednesday in the middle of summer, the players had left Auburn and journeyed to Children's Hospital in Birmingham.<P>
Days off are rare, even in the off-season. Between classes, lifting weights, conditioning, summer jobs and other responsibilities, a free day is sacred, something that is anticipated with the same fervor as Christmas is for small children. But on this off-day, the five players gave up their golf games, fishing trips and extra sleep to go to Birmingham and visit children.<P>
Many other players wanted to go, but commitments would not allow the trip. Cole has become one of Auburn's top spokesmen and has spoken to hundreds of school children on all types of subjects from staying in school to drug awareness. Likewise, Kendall, Mike, Rodney and Alex have participated in many community service activities, not for the publicity, but because they know they can make a difference.<P>
So on a hot, humid, summer day, the players made the two-hour trip to visit children, many who have cheered and jeered while watching them play on television from their hospital rooms.<P>
The response at Children's Hospital was enormous. Originally the staff at the hospital who arrange visits thought that they could put the players in a small activity room and have some of the children come to them. But, after a quick poll, the staff realized that almost every child, even the Alabama fans, wanted to visit with the players.<P>
Armed with only a few media guides and note cards to autograph, the players made their rounds down the hallways. In each room, the players visited with all types of kids, suffering from all types of diseases and ailments. And each time, both groups were rewarded with smiles and laughter.<P>
In the end, I don't know who got more out of the visit, the children or the players. Both groups were touched. The staff at Children's Hospital described the visit as a boat and its wake - at first, you may just notice a ripple, but soon a large wave is formed and the visit and memories carry throughout the week and months as the children continue to fight their private battles.<P>
The players also understand how to fight battles- on and off the field. Cole, Kendall and Rodney have all returned from career-threatening injuries. Mike lost his mother a month before the visit and has battled back from injury. Alex has gone from walk-on to leading tackler in two years.  Each brought and gained a different perspective from the visit.<P>
I also made the trip, and it had a profound impact on me. I have answered a lot of difficult questions and had to deal with some tough situations in my time as Media Relations Director. Somehow, none of that seemed to matter as I watched our players interact with these kids. <P>
That's why the visit was important - for perspective, for enjoyment, for laughter, for understanding, for hope. And it also gave a small child a chance to feel large, brave and bold for telling a mammoth Auburn football player, "heck no, I'm an Alabama fan." But, maybe not as much of one anymore.
