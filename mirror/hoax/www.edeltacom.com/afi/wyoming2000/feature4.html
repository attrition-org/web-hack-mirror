<P>In its 60th season as home to the Auburn Tigers, Jordan-Hare Stadium has made a few innovative changes. As the 2000 Auburn football team heads down Tiger Walk this fall, they will walk towards one of the finest game-day locker rooms in college football.<P>
During the off-season, the home and visitor's locker room were rebuilt in Jordan-Hare Stadium at a cost of $1.5 million.<P>
"We are excited about our new dressing room areas," head coach Tommy Tuberville said. "The new locker room really gives our players something to be proud of. It's first class and is state-of-the-art. They are really going to have a comfortable setting before a football game."<P>
Auburn's locker room, located in the south end zone, increased from 1,300 square feet to 3,232 square feet. The room encases oak lockers in a spacious carpeted area. The signature piece of the locker room is an AU logo centered on the carpet with a large AU logo hanging directly overhead. <P>
"It's very nice," junior fullback Heath Evans said. "The new locker room creates pride and gives us something to look forward to."<P>
Senior center Cole Cubelic, who will be playing his last season in Jordan-Hare Stadium, admires the new locker room. "I really love it. I think it's wonderful, especially compared to how it looked before," Cubelic said. "My favorite part of the new locker room are the lockers. I know these renovations will help out a lot during recruiting."<P>
The room has four televisions that are connected to the stadium's CCTV closed circuit system that will enable the Tigers to watch the pre-game festivities. The locker room also consists of a training room, media room and a photographer's dark room. In the past, post-game press conferences took place in a trailer underneath the stadium. Now the media will be able to utilize a new media room that is connected to the locker room.<P>
The visitor's locker room has also been upgraded. Their area, located in the north end zone, will contain a new dressing room, coach's locker room, media room and training room. The visiting team will enter onto the field from the northeast corner of the end zone this year.<P>
"I've been here on the other side as a visiting head coach," Tuberville said. "I know that these new facilities will give them an opportunity to be a little more relaxed before a game."<P>
As "Eye of the Tiger" begins to blare from Jordan-Hare's sound system, the Tigers will run out from a newly constructed tunnel underneath the south end zone, instead of entering from the southwest side of the stands as in years past.
"I think that it will really set off the pre-game festivities. We wanted to get the band and cheerleaders involved before the team runs out," Tuberville said. "I've been involved with teams running out the middle of the stadium before games. I think that all of the fans will get involved and be in a setting where everyone can get excited."<P>
Kendall Simmons, a junior offensive guard, also feels that the entrance onto the field this season is going to be a thrilling experience. <P>
"It's going to be very exciting to run from the middle of the stadium," Simmons said. "This is a great addition to the other notable changes that have been made to Jordan-Hare. It's really going to be exciting for all of the fans in the stadium."
In addition to the new locker rooms, a new recruiting lounge is also being built. These new renovations are an important part of Auburn's future and shows the Tigers are always progressing towards improvement. The new developments also add a sense of excitement and eagerness to the 2000 Auburn football season. Coaches, players, recruits, and fans will all be impressed by the innovative changes made to Jordan-Hare Stadium.
