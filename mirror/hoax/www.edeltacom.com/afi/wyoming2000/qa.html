<P><B>What are your goals for the season?</B><br>
<I>"We have a lot of talented individuals and if they make the decision to be a team and everybody has the same common goal, they will be very competitive and could vie for the conference title. When Auburn volleyball walks on the court, they need to know that they are great volleyball players. Once they have that belief, they could be dangerous. I have been fortunate enough to have been a part of teams that have been very successful in their conference. The one thing that is common with all of those teams is that for the majority of the teams on their schedule, they know they are going to beat them, those opponents know that they are going to get beat and the opponents know that the team knows they are going to beat them. That
gives you an edge."</I>
<P>
<B>What is your philosophy of coaching?</B><br>
<I>"My philosophy is all about time. There are only two things within society that have term limits: being president and being an intercollegiate athlete. I know our athletes this year are going to get 28 competition dates to play. Multiply that by four, that is 112 dates. That is all you get, so you don"t want to cheat yourself or the program. It is my responsibility to make sure you get the most out of it. From start to finish, you need to get your money"s worth. On paper I do work in the administration but in reality, I represent the players. I have to do what is in the best interest for the team."</I><P>

<B>What will be your style of play?</B><img src=Rnshlr2.jpg alt="Kevin Renshler" border=2 align=right><br>
<I>"I like the run-and-gun type of volleyball. It is not going to be slow, it will be very quick. We are going to put the ball to the
floor as quick and often as possible."</I>
<P>
<B>What type of student-athlete do you recruit?</B><br>
<I>"I like to recruit the type of student-athlete who will fit best with the type of team we have both as a person, a student and an athlete. I look for someone who can communicate to their teammates and who won"t be a social problem and I also look at their style of play."</I><P>

<B>Why did you become a volleyball coach?</B><br>
<I>"Why coach? To make a difference, that is the bottom line. When I look back at my life, a lot of people who have influenced me to be who I am now have been coaches. I have been fortunate enough to be associated with some great coaches and it doesn"t matter what sport it is. There is nothing like the feeling of giving something back to somebody else or making a difference so that they can have a better life down the road. There are times when a coach and athlete don"t see eye to eye but there is that mutual respect that connects you and that is special. Why volleyball? I guess I was at the right place at the right time when someone found me and said - you ought to try and learn how to play this game. "I did and I liked it, my sisters were good at it and I would get in such a zone with the sport and I have been in it ever since."</I>
<P>
<B>Why did you choose to come to Auburn?</B><br>
<I>"I was given the opportunity to come to an institution with both outstanding academics and athletics. Auburn strives to achieve and maintain balance both on and off the court and that is very important. The administration here has a goal for the volleyball program and that is to eventually be one of the premier programs in the nation."</I>
