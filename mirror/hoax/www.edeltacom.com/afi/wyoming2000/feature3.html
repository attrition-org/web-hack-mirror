<P>For the past two years as Auburn fans have poured into Jordan-Hare Stadium to watch the Tigers, they have been reminded of the many great players and coaches that have left lasting impressions on Auburn University, Auburn fans, and Auburn people. These icons have provided a visual history of Auburn football as their photographs have been placed next to the scoreboard in Jordan-Hare Stadium.<P>
These Auburn heroes include coaches Jack Meagher, Shug Jordan, and Pat Dye, and players Terry Beasley, Pat Dye, Bo Jackson, Tracy Rocker and Pat Sullivan. While there have been many other Auburn heroes to step foot on the Auburn campus, these individuals represent all that embodies Auburn football.<P>
With the assistance of Auburn's corporate partners, Coca-Cola, Alabama Power, HealthSouth, Colonial Bank, Russell Athletic, and Great Southern Wood, Jordan-Hare Stadium added the large 15-foot by 11-foot photographs of these icons prior to the 1998 season.<P>
The idea to create a visual history of Auburn football and honor these Auburn legends was led by Athletic Director David Housel, Associate Athletic Director for Marketing Alan Thomas, and Infiniti Sports who manufactured the displays.
"When we discussed the idea and followed through with it, we felt that it was important to give a visual history of Auburn football,"  Thomas said. "We also saw this as a great way to honor each of these individuals and leave Auburn fans with a constant reminder of the program's past."<P>
Coach Jack Meagher came to Auburn in 1934 and coached for nine seasons on the Plains leading the program to its first two bowl games in 1936 and 1937. Meagher's 1936 team played in the Bacardi Bowl that was contested in Havana, Cuba, and is the first and only bowl game to ever by played outside the United States. Meagher is fourth among all Auburn coaches in victories, but it was his vision to create what is now Jordan-Hare Stadium that will be his most lasting impression. His players still meet annually to maintain the bonds that were formed under coach Meagher. <P>
Auburn's winningest coach, Shug Jordan captured 176 victories in his 25-year tenure from 1951 to 1975. Jordan resurrected Auburn football making it a national power in the early 1950's. A true gentleman in victory or defeat, Jordan's name will forever live on in Auburn lore as in 1973, Cliff Hare Stadium became Jordan-Hare Stadium, making it the first stadium in the country to be named for an active coach. The embodiment of an Auburn Man, Jordan's success was the foundation on which the modern football program was built.<P>
During the Jordan Era came Auburn's greatest duo, quarterback Pat Sullivan and wide receiver Terry Beasley. In 1971, Sullivan became the first Auburn player to be awarded the coveted Heisman Trophy, named after former Auburn Coach John Heisman. "Sullivan-to-Beasley" revolutionized the Auburn program from three yards and a cloud of dust to an aerial attack never seen before on the Plains.<P>
The 1980's dawned a new era in Auburn football as Coach Pat Dye resurrected the program leading it to four SEC Championships, including three consecutive. Dye won 99 games in his 12-year reign, winning eight or more games in nine straight years. Auburn's athletics director from 1981 to 1992, Dye was also instrumental in moving the Auburn-Alabama game from Birmingham's Legion Field to Jordan-Hare Stadium in 1989.<P>
Dye also coached the greatest player to don an Auburn uniform and helmet. A statuesque tailback, Vincent "Bo" Jackson is the most recognizable player in school history. A three-sport athlete, Jackson won the 1985 Heisman Trophy and holds nearly every Auburn rushing record. Lettering in football, baseball, and track at Auburn, Jackson was the greatest athlete of his day and was recently named the college athlete of the millennium.<P>
Pat Dye also coached one of Auburn's greatest defensive players. The late 1980's marked the arrival of Tracy Rocker, a defensive tackle that engraved his name in Southeastern Conference history in 1988 when he became the first player in the conference to win both the Outland Trophy and Lombardi Award in the same year. Rocker was the anchor of some of Auburn's greatest defensive teams.<P>
Each of these individuals, during their time helped Auburn football rise to another level. Beginning with Jack Meagher and continuing to present day, each continued to build of the foundations and success set each that proceeded them. These men are just a select few of the numerous legends to have played football for Auburn University. While the names are too many to mention, each is honored by the icons enshrined above the south end zone of Jordan-Hare Stadium. The names of Meagher, Jordan, Dye, Sullivan, Beasley, Jackson, and Rocker will forever embody what Auburn football represents.
