                Despite reductions in state funds that may never be restored, 
                Auburn University continues to make significant progress on many 
                fronts and is achieving unprecedented national recognition. But 
                the long-term success of Auburn and education in general in Alabama 
                is in jeopardy because the state is not positioned to deal with 
                adequate support for all levels of education as we approach the 
                next century. </p>
              <p> Alabama has expanded its system of higher education beyond its 
                ability or willingness to adequately fund. With an outdated and 
                inadequate tax structure and with a K-12 educational system that 
                is in dire need of massive increases in funding, there are unlikely 
                to be sufficient funds to permit Alabama colleges and universities 
                to remain competitive with their peer institutions in other states. 
              </p>
              <p> Clearly, we have some real problems in Alabama and at Auburn 
                that are not going to disappear in the foreseeable future. There 
                are no easy solutions, but we cannot give up because this issue 
                is too important to this state and to its young people who want 
                a quality education. And it is too important to the economic well-being 
                of Alabama. </p>
              <p> We must preserve those qualities that have made Auburn the university 
                that it is and take those steps that are needed to enhance its 
                reputation and capabilities. </p>
              <p> We need to understand and accept the political and economic 
                realities we cannot change, but be determined to take more firm 
                control over our own destiny. We need to play to our strengths 
                and use the resources we have to make use more efficient and effective. 
              </p>
              <p> On the plus side, Auburn has an excellent reputation, especially 
                for the strength and quality of our undergraduate programs. We 
                attract very good students. There are few public institutions 
                in this country that can match the average ACT and SAT scores 
                of our students. This is particularly noteworthy, given the relatively 
                modest admission standards that we impose. </p>
              <p> Auburn's reputation is shaped not by what we say about ourselves 
                but what others say about us. Publications like <i>U.S. News and 
                World Report</i>, <i>Money magazine</i>, and <i>101 Best Values 
                in Colleges and Universities</i>, represent independent assessments 
                of our relative standing compared to other institutions. The U.S. 
                News and World Report last year ranked only two Southeastern Conference-member 
                schools - Vanderbilt and Florida - ahead of Auburn in terms of 
                academic quality. </p>
              <p> I am impressed with our faculty's dedication and its devotion 
                to our students. The quality of students that we produce in each 
                major is a reflection of the care and quality teaching provided 
                by our faculty. </p>
              <p> We have a distinguished and devoted alumni. Few universities 
                the size of Auburn have produced so many outstanding leaders in 
                so many fields. There is no alumni group anywhere that is more 
                interested in or supportive of a university. The success of Campaign 
                Auburn is a good example of that. </p>
              <p> Lastly, we have an intangible factor that few other universities 
                possess. We call it the Auburn Spirit. It is real. It infects 
                students who attend this institution and influences the kind of 
                students we attract. It has a major impact on our alumni and their 
                interest in and support of the institution. It infects anyone 
                who is a part of the Auburn Family. This spirit produces in anyone 
                who is touched by it a desire to preserve those values that make 
                Auburn unique; fosters an attitude that says in spite of any obstacles 
                we face, we will survive and succeed; and creates a bond that 
                holds us together. It creates in each of us a feeling that we 
                are a part of something that is bigger than ourselves and that 
                is worth preserving and passing on to future generations. Few 
                other universities possess such an intangible asset. </p>
              <p> How can we use our assets to insure a brighter future for Auburn? 
                Here is the sort of strategy that I would propose. </p>
              <p> First, the Auburn that I envision in the future is one that 
                builds upon an already strong undergraduate program to position 
                it as one of the very best at a major public university. It is 
                one that produces graduates who are well trained in their chosen 
                disciplines and are in strong demand by employers, but who have 
                also been broadly educated in those areas that distinguish an 
                educated person. It is a program that graduates a high percentage 
                of the students who are admitted. We should strive for a six-year 
                graduation rate of 75 percent. If we can achieve this goal, this 
                would place Auburn behind only two other public universities in 
                the South - the University of Virginia and the University of North 
                Carolina. </p>
              <p> To achieve our goals, it is important that we manage our undergraduate 
                enrollment more carefully, increase our admission standards at 
                the undergraduate level, maintain an honors program that challenges 
                the most highly academically qualified and motivated students 
                and provide student development programs and leadership opportunities. 
              </p>
              <p> I envision a university that has a few programs of national 
                or international stature. When one studies the history of universities, 
                it is apparent that most institutions that achieve national stature 
                do so in a few areas where they become clearly recognized as leaders. 
                That sort of strategy has tended to be successful even during 
                times when resources were growing rapidly. </p>
              <p> Auburn can be all of those things, but it wonÍt be easy. But 
                it will only happen when we work together and when we are willing 
                to make the hard choices that will provide the resources needed 
                to support those efforts. Auburn may become a smaller but more 
                significant university with fewer students, faculty, staff and 
                administrators. </p>
              <p> But those hard choices may also give us the ability to have 
                a more effective and lasting impact on those individuals who are 
                educated and those clients who are served by Auburn University.
