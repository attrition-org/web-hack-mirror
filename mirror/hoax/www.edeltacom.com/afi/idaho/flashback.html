<P>Two of Auburn's most staunch supporters and contributors to the 1949 football team had just witnessed one of the school's biggest upsets in the 58-year history of the program.
<P>Dressed in a $200 overcoat and a top hat, one of the two fans was overcome with emotion and entered the lockerroom, according to Auburn quarterback Travis Tidwell.
<P>"I was in the shower and all of a sudden this man gets in the shower with me," Tidwell said. "He was fully clothed in his overcoat and top hat with cigar in hand. There were tears streaming down his face and he just wanted to congratulate me."
<P>The rivalry between Auburn and Alabama in 1949 was nothing like the intense rivalry it is today, but the game still held plenty of meaning to both squads.
<P>It was a cold afternoon on Dec. 3, 1949, when the 25-point underdog team from the Plains traveled to Birmingham's Legion Field to face the Crimson Tide.
<P>The rivalry had renewed one year earlier after a 40-year hiatus and Alabama defeated Auburn by a count of 55-0 in the 1948 contest.
Entering the game with just one victory on the season, the Tigers knew they would have their hands full with the Tide, but felt good about their chances for a victory.

<P>The Crimson Tide's main concern in the game was to put a stop to the Tiger passing attack led by the talented Tidwell. As the game progressed, Tidwell's impact didn't come through the air as he only attempted one pass during the game. It was Tidwell's legs, not his arm, that proved to be the difference maker. 
<P>"I was a passing quarterback," Tidwell said. "I turned a lot of plays that were supposed to be passing plays into scrambling plays. Being able to scramble had a lot to do with controlling the ball."
<P>The game remained scoreless through the first period, but the game's turning point came on an 84-yard quick kick by right halfback Jim McGowen.
<P>"I lined up under center and the snap went directly through my legs to McGowen," Tidwell said. "McGowen kicked the ball and it barely rolled over the goal line for a touchback. But the field position change was the key because we were in bad shape."
<P>With the Tide backed up against their goal line, the Tigers struck first as Johnny Wallis intercepted a pass and ran it back 18 yards giving Auburn a 7-0 advantage. The Tide would answer right before halftime tying the score at seven apiece. 
<P>Tied at seven, the Tigers marched 71 yards for the go-ahead touchdown early in the fourth quarter as left halfback Davis drove through the offensive line for the score. The extra point was good and the Tigers took a 14-7 lead. 
<P>The Tide took the ball back, but turned it over on downs with the clock ticking away. Auburn held the ball for five plays, then had to punt. A 21-yard punt by McGowen led to good field position for Alabama on its own 47-yard line. 
<P>Alabama capitalized on the field position with a six-play scoring drive to make the score 14-13 with the extra point to come. Alabama's place kicker, also their quarterback, lined up for the kick and watched his effort sail wide right.
<P>An expected on-side kick attempt failed and Tidwell ran out the clock with three more plays as the Tigers completed one of the greatest victories in Auburn history.
<P>"It was one of the biggest upsets in the history of Auburn," Tidwell said. "We went into the game as underdogs, but we were the ones who played like champions."
<P>The 1949 Tigers left the field that day with the memories of their four previous losses and three ties on the season behind them. Instead, they took the memories from the upset that made their season a success with them. 
<P>"We left the field to the Auburn fans chanting '14 is more than 13'," Tidwell said. "It was a tremendous feeling for everyone."
