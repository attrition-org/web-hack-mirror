<P>
Karen Richter begins her first season as head coach of the Auburn soccer program after serving as head coach at Central Florida for the past six years. A former standout goalkeeper at her alma mater, Richter led the Golden Knights to five Trans America Athletic Conference titles and a trip to the 1998 NCAA Tournament. As a senior in 1990, she was recognized as the NCAA Goalkeeper of the Year. Richter joined the AU staff on April 1, 1999.

<P><B>What attracted you to Auburn?</B>
<BR><I>It was a tough decision because I was at Central Florida for 12 years as a player and coach and I always said it would take a perfect situation for me to leave my alma mater. Auburn presented the absolute perfect career opportunity. I love the facilities, the people are great, and I saw a program with a lot of potential. The commitment that Auburn makes to its athletic program gives us an unlimited potential for success.</I>

<P><B>What style of play can Auburn fans expect from a Karen Richter coached team?</B>
<BR><I>Fans can expect a possession style with an exciting attack. A big part of our style of play is being able to possess the ball. We like to attack in a variety of ways, which is very important. Sometimes we will attack from the flank, up the middle, or from our front runners. That makes it an exciting game and it makes it difficult to defend. 
</I>
<P><B>What are your expectations from this year's team?</B>
<BR><I>I expect a lot of potential for growth. I was able to work with the team for about three weeks in the spring and in just that short period of time the effort and the development of the players was very exciting for us to see. We saw a lot of improvement. The player's attitudes are phenomenal, they've been working hard this summer with a tough conditioning and weight program, and thus I expect a lot of improvement. I expect improvement with this team from game to game and that's our goal.
</I>
<P><B>What goals have you set for this program?</B>
<BR><I>Our immediate goal this season is to make the SEC Tournament. It is obtainable, but it will be a difficult task because the SEC is extremely competitive in women's soccer. Once we accomplish that goal, we want to be successful within the SEC and position ourselves to be in the top half of the conference. By being competitive in the conference, it would make us competitive on the national level.</I>

<P><B>How would you evaluate women's soccer in the SEC?</B>
<BR><I>I think that the conference as a whole is the premier conference in the country. Last year the SEC tied with the Big Ten for most teams in the NCAA Tournament and we produced the national champion in Florida. So, I think it is the premier conference nationally. Obviously, the Atlantic Coast Conference has the tradition, but I believe the SEC is the future. That's exciting to be a part of because every conference game we play will be challenging, exciting and a high level of competition.
</I>
<P><B>What effects will the United States Women's World Cup victory this summer have on girl's and women's soccer?</B>
<BR><I>The U.S. Women's World Cup victory has given women's soccer a big boost nationally. In particular, it has increased the sport's credibility and exposure through the national media. The numbers to watch the games in person and on television were overwhelming and far exceeded what was expected. In general, the World Cup will have, and has had, a positive effect on youth soccer and young girls. It has given them role models and something to shoot for just like boys do. Also, more girls will be interested in playing soccer, which in part will have a trickle-down effect on high schools and colleges in the future.

<P><B>What is your favorite sport other than soccer?</B> <BR><I>"Basketball."</I>

<P><B>Something that most people don't know about you?</B><BR> <I>"I was an honor student in college."</I>

<P><B>Thing you enjoy to do most away from work?</B><BR> <I>"Jet ski and wake boarding."</I>

<P><B>What do you enjoy most about Auburn?</B><BR><I> "The people in the athletic department and community. They are all very friendly and supportive."</I>

<P><B>How did you get involved in soccer?</B><BR> <I>"When I was eight years old we moved to Chicago. The first thing my mother did was to sign me up for youth soccer. I thought that it was the craziest sport because you used your feet and not your hands. I also didn't want to run because the field was so big. That's why I chose to be a goalkeeper-  so I could use my hands and so that I didn't have to run so much."</I>
