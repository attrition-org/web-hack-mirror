<P>Some people know him as "Dirty," some may know him as "Little Man" or "Little Ant," but one thing people know about Antwoine Nolan is that he is a fierce football player and a fierce talker.
<P>"I got the name 'Dirty' because that is just the style of football that I play," Nolan said. "I am the guy on the bottom of the pile throwing sand in your eyes. However, I am the first guy to shake your hand after the game and say good game no matter who wins."
Antwoine got the nickname in high school while playing at East Coweta where he was named one of the top 50 players in Georgia by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1995. He also ran track, played basketball and baseball in high school. 
<P>Nolan still recalls his high school days and uses four of his friends from high school as motivation every time he steps on the field.
"There was a group of us called the 'Five Dirty Dogs' in high school and just Karsten Bailey (former Auburn wide receiver) and I made it to college football," said Nolan. "We have to carry on the spirit of the Dogs. I talk to the other guys on the phone, and they say that they live through me and Karsten, and that just gives me inspiration to go out every day."
<P>With that motivation on his side, Nolan has started 25 consecutive games entering this week. As a junior, he was tied for second on the team last season with four broken up passes and led the team in 1997 with 12 broken-up passes. Last year against Central Florida, Nolan recorded a career-high 14 tackles, including one for a loss. On the year he posted 48 tackles increasing his total for his career to 126.
<P>Nolan pulled down his one interception last season against Louisiana Tech, and with his recent move to safety he is looking for more.
<P>"I am looking to get about seven interceptions this year," said Nolan. "I would also like to get around 100 tackles. I love contact, so the move to safety will get me down with the big boys and give me a chance to make some more plays which is more fun and right up my alley."
<P>The move to safety cost Nolan his starting position, which he has held since he was a freshman where he played cornerback. Defensive Coordinator John Lovett moved Nolan to safety near the end of two-a-day practices.
<P>"It's a move that I thought would happen earlier than it did," said Nolan. "To be a starter for three years and then to move to third team as a senior is going to be difficult. Yet, I am willing to do whatever I need to in order to make this team better, if I need to play linebacker I will."
<P><P>With the move to safety, Nolan sees some possibility of it helping his bid for a professional football career.
"The NFL likes to see players who are versatile and who are not afraid to learn new positions, so if this can also help me down the road, I am all for it," said Nolan. "I hope to be playing football 10 years down the road, but if not, I would like to run my own business."
<P>In the opening game against Appalachian State last week Nolan saw action at both safety and cornerback. Even though he did not get the starting nod in the game last Saturday, his presence was known both before, during and after the game.
<P>"I tried to look at it as positive as I could," said Nolan. "I kept talking and trying to keep the guys who were in the game up. We were a little sluggish, but you are going to be because it was the first game of the season. We came out fired up and we rebounded from the mistakes we made and got a win."
<P>Playing two positions during the game against Appalachian State was a difficult task for the Newnan, Ga., native, but Nolan knows with more practice and more snaps during games the dual role will become easier. 
<P>"It was a lot different playing at both positions. During the game it was hard trying to adjust to a new assignment before every snap," said Nolan. "It will get better as the season goes on, as will the whole team. I have been playing cornerback for three years so it was a little easier, but I like playing safety better."
<P>Nolan has gained a reputation as one of Auburn's most vocal players.
<P>"I don't really like all that trash talking out there," said Lovett. "But as long as he can back up what he is saying I will not stop him."
<P>Nolan also uses his mouth as a motivator for the younger players and to relieve some tension in the air. After practice, Nolan can sometimes be seen with a bullhorn yelling at the top of his lungs trying to get smiles on the faces of the players.
<P>"I love to motivate people and if I have to use reverse psychology on them I will," said Nolan. "I have a couple of players on the team that get most of my yelling. I like to pick on Roderick Hood and Michael Owens. I am just trying to make them tough and maybe even turn them into me." 
<P>Nolan's actions on the field are considered crazy, and when he gets off the field he might be considered crazy as well. The senior is the proud owner of two python snakes, "Ghostface Killer" and "Little Dirty." They seem to fit Nolan's personality, but he has not always been a fan of snakes and neither was his former roommate and former Tiger free safety Brad Ware.
<P>"I was terrified of snakes in high school, but Cole Cubelic put one on me my freshman year and they were not as bad as I thought," said Nolan. "Now with Brad (Ware), he would never let me go to sleep because when I first got Ghostface, 'Ghostface' got to Brad a couple of times. So one night around three in the morning, I put 'Ghostface' around his neck to pay him back. I have never had any problems from him since then."
<P>With the snakes put aside for the Saturday showdowns Nolan has set some goals that he would like to see the Tigers accomplish throughout the season.
<P>"The thing I would most like to see is for us to come together as a team this season. It seemed sometimes last season we began to be selfish and not work as a team to achieve our overall team goals," said Nolan.
<P>After three years on the Plains, the communications major has played with many great players and has experienced many exhilarating experiences. Nolan was a member of the 1997 SEC West Championship team and has taken two trips to bowl games.
<P>"Just to have been on the field with some of the great players in Auburn Football history is something I will remember," said Nolan. "Players like Karsten Bailey, Dameyune Craig, and Takeo Spikes have made my experience here memorable. The most memorable play that I have is in 1996 when I got an interception against Alabama."
