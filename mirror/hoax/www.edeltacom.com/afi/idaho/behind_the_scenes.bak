<P>He's going to need an IV! We're going to have to get an X-ray to determine how bad of a break it is! Hurry up and bring me some bandages!"
<P>This isn't the scene of doctors talking at a hospital, but instead it's the athletic trainers working with the players on the Auburn football team.
<P>The athletic trainers do a little bit of everything for the student athletes at Auburn. Their main job is prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of injuries to student athletes. Also they are responsible for taking care of the athlete's entire body; physically and mentally.
<P>Auburn's football trainers are guided by head trainer, Arnold Gamber, and Director of Sports Medicine, Mike Roberts. Beneath them are three football graduate assistants; Bryan Matson, Carrie Rubertino, and Dan Stockman. This group, along with several undergraduate trainers, work day and night to ensure the welfare and health of the Auburn football team.
<P>"The first priority of a trainer is the medical status of an athlete," Gamber said. "Along with that, we also have to be a counselor, nutritionist, or whatever the athlete needs. We deal with anything from a cracked toenail to a nose hair."
<P>It is not an easy road to become an athletic trainer. You must either receive a degree from an accredited institution or do an internship consisting of 1,500 hours. Then you have to take the National Athletic Trainers Association Board of Certification test to become certified.

<P>Many times, trainers themselves start out as athletes who were injured and became interested in the field of sports medicine after going through treatment and rehabilitation. "I had a knee injury while playing football and was rehabed by an athletic trainer," Matson said.
<P>The life of an athletic trainer is not an easy one, as long hours are the rule, not the exception.
<P>In the mornings before practice the trainers must be at the training room about an hour and 45 minutes before the players, which is generally around 4 a.m. Everything in the training room and on the field must be set up, such as having enough water for the players and making sure there is nothing hazardous on the field. All the players must come to the training room before they even step foot on the field, get taped and whatever else they may need.
<P>During practice the trainers must make sure that the players stay hydrated, monitor the players and treat any injuries that occur. After practice they go back to the training room and treat the players that come in. Then they must do paper work on all the student athletes who were seen in the training room. 
<P>Later in the afternoon, they go through the entire process again and at the end of the day, which may be into the wee hours of the night, they all come together to talk about the day's events. Finally, they get to go home and rest before they do the same thing again the next day. 
<P>Of course, once two-a-days are over things get a little less hectic, but they still are up early every morning before the sun rises to open up the training room for any athletes that may need treatment. Then they stay into the night way after the sun has set until the last player has received whatever they may need.
<P>There is also a lot of pressure and stress involved with being a trainer; especially during the games when injuries occur. "Last year one of our running backs went down," Stockman said. "I was the first person on the scene for a possible spine injury. It was a false alarm, but it was a real intense and a pressure filled situation."
<P>"There is a lot of stress involved with returning the players to the playing field as soon as possible without compromising the players' own well being," Rubertino added.
<P>Of course the benefits of being an athletic trainer are numerous. To see an athlete who was injured get immediate treatment, follow through with rehab and then return to play is an indescribable experience for most trainers.  
<P>With Auburn's athletic training staff the football players are in good hands, as they will do whatever it takes to prevent, care for, and rehabilitate any injuries a football player may incur.
