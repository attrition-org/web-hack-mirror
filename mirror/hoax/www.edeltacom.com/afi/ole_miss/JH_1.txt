Today in Jordan-Hare

by Kirk Sampson

Auburn hosts Ole Miss today in the Tigers' SEC home opener.  It marks the fifth time in the 1990's that Ole Miss has served as AU's conference home opener.  Auburn is 16-3-1 in its last 20 conference home openers. 
Shooting for 
Win #600
The Tigers are aiming for the 600th win in school history this weekend.  Auburn enters the Ole Miss game with an all-time record of 599-355-47.   Auburn is tied with Washington for 16th among Division I schools in wins.  
The Huskies, who entered this season with 599 wins are 0-2 this season and host Colorado Saturday. 
Looking for 
Another Milestone
The Tigers will look to win their 400th game played in the state of Alabama against Ole Miss.  Auburn holds a 399-159-19 (.709) record in games played in the state of Alabama. 
Tuberville Off to Personal Best Start
The 3-0 start is head coach Tommy Tuberville's best start in five years as a head coach.  Twice while he was at Ole Miss, in 1996 and 1997, he began the season with a 2-0 mark.
Leard Silences 
Death Valley
Quarterback Ben Leard continued his resurgence as the Tigers signal caller against LSU.  Against the Tigers, Leard threw for a career-high 304 yards and three touchdowns.  His 84-yard scoring strike to freshman Ronney Daniels in the second quarter was Leard's longest touchdown pass of his career.
Leard became just the fifth Auburn quarterback to throw for more than 300 yards in a game and the first since Dameyune Craig in 1997 to accomplish the feat.  His 304 yards ranks him 23rd on the AU single game list.

Defense Stops the Run
The Auburn defense has been stingy when it comes to the run, allowing just 70.7 yards per game.  In its last two games, the Tigers have held Idaho and LSU to under 200 yards below their average.
Idaho entered their game with Auburn averaging 271 rushing yards and were held to 59, while LSU came into last Saturday's game averaging 270 yards and were limited to just 26 yards on the ground.
LSU's Rondell Mealey, who averaged 138 yards in his first two games, only mustered 23 yards on 12 carries against the Tigers.
Big Plays
The Auburn offensive scheme under the direction of coordinator Noel Mazzone has seen its fair share of big plays.  Auburn has had a total of 16 completions of 20 yards or more, including seven of 30 yards or more.  Ben Leard has accounted for 14 of the completions over 20 yards.  Twice the Tigers have had rushing plays over 20 yards.
Daniels Finds Paydirt
Freshman receiver Ronney Daniels has four touchdowns in his first three career games after scoring a pair of touchdowns against Appalachian State and LSU.  The last AU receiver with four TD's in three games was Tyrone Goodson in 1996 versus LSU, South Carolina and Miss. St.
Point Production
Through three games in 1999, Auburn has 93 points and has scored in 11 of 12 quarters including a string of 10 consecutive.  Last season it took the Tigers seven games before scoring 93 points.
63 and Counting
Ben Leard has attempted 63 consecutive passes without an interception dating back to the 1998 Florida game.  The school record for most consecutive pass attempts without an interception is 89 set by Randy Campbell during the 1982 season.
Linebackers Making Noise
 Starting linebackers Haven Fields and Alex Lincoln have put up impressive numbers this season.  Fields and Lincoln lead Auburn in tackles with 28 and 25, respectively.  The pair combined for 21 stops against LSU and 18 tackles against Idaho.  Of the team's 16 tackles for loss, the Fields and Lincoln duo have combined for nine.
Fields had one of the most dominating performances of a Tiger defensive player in recent memory with five tackles for losses against LSU.
Averaging nine tackles a game this season, Fields averaged 2.4 tackles per contest in his first three years at Auburn.  Lincoln, meanwhile, is a former walk-on who transferred to the Plains after two years at Mississippi College.
Dynamite Duval
Redshirt freshman punter Damon Duval will be remembered for his touchdown score on a fake field goal against LSU.  What should not go overlooked was his superb kicking effort.  Duval connected on both of his field goal attempts (23 and 44 yards) and was perfect on four PAT's.  
The Chattanooga, Tenn., native also had his best punting effort of the season.  Duval, who averaged 37.8 yards against Appalachian State and 42.9 yards versus Idaho, had five kicks for a 45.6 average in Saturday's win.  Duval boomed a 56 yard punt for no return early in the fourth quarter.
Quick Out of the Blocks
Auburn has outscored their opponents 37-0 in the first quarter and has allowed just five first downs and 72 total yards in three games.
In the last two victories over Idaho and LSU, Auburn has allowed only one first down and held the two squads to a minus 15 yards of total offense in the first period.  
The Auburn offense has scored on six out of 12 possessions in the first quarter, while the three opponents are scoreless on 12 first quarter possessions.
