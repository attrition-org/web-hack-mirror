Up Close withlayneandersonHow did you become involved in running? “My dad was a sprinter in college and continued to run when he was in the military.  Like most boys, I wanted to emulate my dad, so that’s why I started running.  I kept running and once I got into high school, running was the sport I knew I could be most competitive in.”Where is your favorite place to run in Auburn? “Probably on the track.  I’m the type of person who likes to put the spikes on and get on the track and run hard.  That is where you run fast.  That’s where you really do things performance-wise that give you the confidence before running a race.”What do you enjoy doing besides coaching? “I enjoy sports and really like to attend other Auburn sporting events.  I like them all, but I like watching the swim team the most.  It has a lot of similarities to running.  The training is similar, the amount of hours and the physical exertion that is involved.  While there is some technique and strategy involved, it is primarily strictly about training.What is something that most people don’t know about you? “I’ve lived in Korea, Panama, Italy and Germany.  I spent a great deal of my adolescent life living outside of the United States.”
