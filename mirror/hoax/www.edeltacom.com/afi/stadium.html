                Arguably the nation's finest combination of size, beauty and mystique, 
                Jordan-Hare Stadium is in its 58th season as home of the Auburn 
                Tigers. </p>
              <p> Long considered one of the most attractive stadiums college 
                football has to offer, and currently the seventh-largest on-campus 
                facility in the country, Jordan-Hare Stadium has seen Auburn win 
                over 82 percent of its home games since opening in 1939. Its size 
                is illustrated by its rank among Alabama's largest cities. On 
                game day, Jordan-Hare and its 85,214 occupants constitute the 
                fifth-largest city in Alabama. </p>
              <p> The facility's beauty is highlighted by the massive landscaping 
                on display in each of the four corners inside the stadium. </p>
              <p> And Jordan-Hare's mystique was noted this past summer by national 
                college football writer Ivan Maisel of <i>New York Newsday</i>, 
                who ranked Auburn's home as the second-loudest stadium in all 
                of college football. </p>
              <p> Named for Ralph "Shug" Jordan, Auburn's all-time winningest 
                coach with 176 victories, and Clifford Leroy Hare, a member of 
                Auburn's first football team and a longtime chairman of the Faculty 
                Athletic Committee, the stadium was first opened and dedicated 
                as Auburn Stadium at the AU-Florida game Nov. 30, 1939, with a 
                capacity of 7,440. </p>
              <p> In 1951, Jordan became coach and the stadium that was to bear 
                his name began a period of rapid growth brought about by the success 
                of his football teams. Fourteen thousand seats were added in 1955, 
                bringing the stadium capacity to 34,500. The south end zone stands 
                were constructed in 1960, and the stadium became a complete bowl 
                10 years later with an increased capacity of 61,261. </p>
              <p> Named Jordan-Hare Stadium in 1973, it became the first stadium 
                in the country to be named for an active coach. Jordan-Hare Stadium 
                was enlarged for the fourth time to seat 72,169 fans in 1980 with 
                the opening of the west upper deck, scholarship donor level and 
                press box. </p>
              <p> Construction of the east upper deck was completed July 1, 1987. 
                The $15.5 million project added more than 10,000 seats and provided 
                additional seating for scholarship donors. The stadium expansion 
                also included 71 executive suites along the club level, a recruiting 
                lounge and a reception room for Auburn's football lettermen. </p>
              <p> Since the expansion, 4.9 million fans have come to Jordan-Hare 
                Stadium to watch the Tigers. And Auburn has responded, posting 
                a 74-10-3 (.868) home record since 1983. </p>
