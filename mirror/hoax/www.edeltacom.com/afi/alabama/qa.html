<B>What do you feel is the best part of coaching?</B><BR>
<I>As a graduate of Auburn University, I am glad to coach here and mix in together the Auburn tradition with the best golf facilities in the country. I really enjoy having a chance to coach these excellent student-athletes.</I>

<P><B>What are your goals for the 1999-2000 season?</B>
<BR><I>Since we are underway thus far, we have achieved some of our goals. We have had some individual winners in the fall tournaments. We have also placed well as a team. We just want to try to continue to prepare for each event, one by one. We do not want to try and get ahead of ourselves. We will focus on each tournament and keep the players prepared in academics and
their everyday lives. It is very important for each of our players to be well rounded.
</I>
<P><B>Who is the leader of the team this year?</B>
<BR><I>We look for leadership in all of our players. Our seniors, Kami Smith and Audrey Fisher, have a lot of experience. We will lean on them throughout the season. We've had two sophomores and two freshmen that have consistently been in the lineup the whole fall season. We expect everybody on our team to step up as a leader.</I>

<P><B>What has been your greatest achievement as the Auburn women's golf head
coach?</B>
<BR><I>Winning the SEC Championship in 1996 was a big achievement for us. I also feel that it is a great achievement to see your first recruiting class compete together. We have made it to the NCAA Championships all four years with our first recruiting class. It is a huge honor to see your recruits come to Auburn, get the job done and graduate. They will move on to achieve bigger and greater things after they graduate from Auburn.</I>

</TABLE>
<P><B>What assets would you like prospective recruits to possess?</B>
<BR><I>We look for players with character. As much as we travel, we have to find players with the total package. I want to put student-athletes together that have a strong will to do well in the classroom, are well-rounded, and who are very competitive on the golf course. Competitiveness is the main key to a successful player.
</I>
<P><B>What are the strengths of the 1999-2000 Auburn women's golf team?</B>
<BR><I>The strength of our team this year is our youth. We have a lot to look forward to in years to come. Our main strength is that we are physically strong, exciting and explosive.</I>

<P><B>How will your team stay focused during the break between the fall and spring seasons?</B>
<BR><I>We have an excellent workout program for the off-season. This program will help the players stay physically fit and focused on the season ahead of us. Our players are ready to make a mark in the spring season. They are very anxious and are looking forward to the spring season.</I>

<p><h3>Up Close With Kim Evans</h3><P>
<B>What sport at Auburn University do you enjoy watching the most?</B>
<BR><I>"Basketball is a very exciting sport. They both performed well last year and I know that both programs will continue with their success this season.  I really enjoy watching the women's and men's basketball teams."</I>

<P><B>If you were stranded on a deserted island and could only listen to one song, what song would it be?</B>
<BR><I>"Anything by Jimmy Buffett."</I>

<P><B>If you could be any character out of a book, who would you be? </B>
<BR><I>"I would be Nancy Drew. I think that detective stories and books about forensic policemen investigating murders are interesting."</I>
