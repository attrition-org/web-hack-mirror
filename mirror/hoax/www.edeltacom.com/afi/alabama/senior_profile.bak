<P>As a college walk-on you learn a lot of things. You learn that it takes hard work, desire to continue a career, and the understanding that life is not always fair. Auburn's Brandon White knows these things well. 
<P>White, a senior from Birmingham, has worked hard to earn a scholarship and a shot at playing time. Playing wing back at Hewitt-Trussville High School in Birmingham, White was not given the opportunity to put up gaudy receiving statistics to lure recruiters.  
<P>"At Hewitt, I played in a big time rushing offense. I played wing back and only caught a couple of passes. I ran the ball some, but after high school I didn't have any scholarship offers," White said. 
White decided to come to Auburn, and wasn't ready to give up football.  
<P>"I came to Auburn because I could get in-state tuition and I wanted to continue to play football, so I walked on," White said.  
<P>White spent three seasons working hard on the scout team trying to earn the attention of the coaching staff and a scholarship.  
<P>"I think playing as a walk-on, it teaches you that life is not always fair," White said.  "I have seen a lot of guys come through here and work hard and never get a scholarship. It is hard for some of the scholarship guys to understand what it is the walk-ons go through."
<P>"Having talked to my friends (and former Tigers) Karsten Bailey, and Tyrone Goodson about their efforts to earn spots in the pros, they said they now can relate to what I have gone through. They see that you just have to work hard and move your way up the ladder. No one is going to give you anything," White said.
<P>White was fortunate enough to earn a scholarship prior to this season and now feels that he has been recognized for his hard work. 
<P>"I felt that I had earned my scholarship and it was nice to be recognized for my efforts," White said.  
<P>This season White has worked hard to get playing time and help the offense any way he can. Although the Tigers have not won as many games as he would have liked his senior year, White still has goals for the season's remaining three games.  
<P>
"I would like to see this team persevere," White said. "I feel like winning, just like losing, is contagious. You get used to it and you allow it to happen and you find yourself making errors both mentally and physically. I would like to see us overcome that. And I still think this team can accomplish some great things in the course of the next three games."  
<P>Although White has not seen as much playing time as he would like he has continued to work hard and enjoy his football experience.  
<P>"The Tiger Walks are great, to see how many people are involved in what you are doing is exciting," White said. "Having watched games from the stands I realize how many people would love to play on that field in front of 85,000 people and see the games from the sidelines. I realize how fortunate I am."
<P>Upon finishing his playing days later this fall, White will continue to work hard to fulfill another goal, attending Law School.  White, who is a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll, will take the LSAT in December and would like to attend the University of Colorado. Looking back at his four-and-a-half years at Auburn, White says he would do it all over again. 
<P>"I would do it all over again, I have no regrets and I have learned a lot from my playing experiences," White said. "I have learned that even if you work hard you don't always win. Football teaches you how to handle failure as well as success."
