<P>When Dr. James E. Martin steps onto the field on Saturday, the former Auburn basketball and track star and later President of Auburn University will be receiving an award he was bestowing upon others ten years ago.
<P>"I'm sure I'll feel a little bit different," Martin said.
<P>Martin, who was President from 1984 to 1992, has been chosen as the 19th annual Walter Gilbert Award winner for former Auburn athletes who have succeeded in their chosen profession.
<P>"Obviously, I'm honored and flattered to have been selected," Martin said. "It's the highest award a former athlete can receive, and when you think about the past winners, it's truly an honor."
<P>Martin, who came to Auburn in 1950 under a four-year athletic scholarship for basketball and track, received a B.S. degree in agricultural administration in 1954. While at Auburn, Martin roomed with another future Walter Gilbert Award winner - William A. Fickling, who won the award in 1985. Martin presented Fickling with the award at the ceremonies.
<P>Following his graduation from Auburn, Martin entered graduate school at North Carolina State and received his M.S. in agricultural economics there in 1956.
<P>After two years of service as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army, Martin found himself back in the classroom, this time as a doctoral candidate at Iowa State, where he received his doctorate in agricultural economics in 1962.
<P>In 1968, Martin became Dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Virginia Polytechnic Institute after a two-year stint as Head of the Department of Agricultural Economics there. He held the Dean's position until 1975.
In 1980, Martin became President of the University of Arkansas after six months as Interim President. While at Arkansas, Martin initiated the University of Arkansas Press, established the Razorback Scholarship Fund Inc., to help support the Fayetteville intercollegiate athletic program, and reorganized and computerized the University of Arkansas Foundation alumni listing which resulted in increased assets by some 300 percent. He also initiated higher admission standards for the Fayetteville campus.
<P>Martin found himself back at his alma mater, the "loveliest village on the Plains," in 1984 as the 14th President of Auburn University. From 1984 to 1992, Martin left an indelible mark on the state's largest university that will benefit students and Alabamians for decades to come.
<P>Several milestones were reached during Martin's tenure as President. Most notable was the enrollment of 20,000 students for the first time in school history as well as the graduation of 4,000 students in one year for the first time. During his tenure, Martin presented over 33 thousand degrees, accounting for almost a quarter of all degrees conferred during Auburn's history.
<P>While at Auburn, Martin served on the Board of Directors of the Auburn University Foundation, the Alabama Shakespeare Festival Theatre Finance Authority, the Business Council of Alabama, the Southern Regional Education Board, as well as President and Vice-President of the Southeastern Conference. In 1986, he received the National 4-H Distinguished Alumni Award.
<P>These days, Martin resides in Decatur with his wife, Ann. Though retired, Martin still stays busy writing computer software, a hobby of his for years. He and his wife have three children - Michael, 40, William, 38, and Jill Richmond, 36. The Martins also have five grandchildren.
<P>And while all this keeps him busy, Martin tries to find time to visit Auburn now and then.
<P>"We thoroughly enjoyed our years in Auburn," Martin said. "It's a delightful place to be, and we miss it."
