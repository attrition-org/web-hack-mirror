<P>Growing up off the coast of South Carolina as a little boy, Rusty Williams never had a father to run along the beach with or play tag football in the backyard. Williams hopes that he will have the chance to do these things with his own son, though, as he grows up in his father's hometown of Moncks Corner, S.C. 
<P>Williams was never able to follow in his own father's footsteps, since his father passed away from cancer in the pancreas a few months before he was born. He hopes to be able to be the father to his son, Brandon, that he never had while growing up. 
<P>Even though Williams left all his family in Moncks Corner, S.C., to play football at Auburn, he still feels very close to his family. Brandon resides with his mother and grandmother, but the four-year-old comes to Auburn with Williams' mother all the time to see his father. And, the elder Williams sees Brandon whenever he goes home.
Williams left South Carolina and came to Auburn to follow his lifelong dream of playing running back, as well as follow other South Carolina players at Auburn such as Stephen Davis. He hopes that one day his son will follow in his footsteps and play running back as well.
<P>"I am teaching him how to play sports," Williams said. "I would love for him to one day play football, in particular running back like me."
<P>In addition to playing running back, Williams has seen action at a wide range of other positions. In high school, he played wide receiver, free safety, corner back, kicker, and running back. 
<P>At Auburn he started his career at tailback and proceeded to move around to various other positions. Last year he played four different positions - tailback, wide receiver, free safety, and fullback. In this, his senior year, Williams has come full circle and is back to where he started - at running back. 
<P>"I didn't mind playing different positions," Williams said. "I am happy though to be back at running back. That's the way I started my career and that's the way I will end it."
<P>One of the reasons Williams came to Auburn was to play running back and he also liked the way Auburn did things. 
<P>Although he was recruited by many schools in the state of South Carolina, Williams didn't want to play in his home state. He was also recruited by several schools, such as Notre Dame and Penn State, but chose Auburn because it was not too far away from his home, family and son Brandon.
<P>After graduation this spring with a degree in economics, Williams plans to try and get a job closer to home, so he can spend more time with Brandon and do things with him that he never had the opportunity to do with his father. 
<P>"I want to be a business man and do real estate work," Williams said. "My dream is to sell large houses in Atlanta or Charlotte and one day actually own a mansion off the coast of Maine, like the mansions that I hope to sell."
<P>In the meantime until he graduates, Williams just enjoys hanging out with his friends and watching football on television. Unlike most of the players on the team, he does not enjoy playing cards and dislikes PlayStation. He does try to amuse others, though, with his comic acts, as he claims to be an excellent comedian. 
<P>So as Williams' days of being an Auburn running back come to a close, he can hope that one day his son, who looks just like his father does, will have the opportunity to play football, too.
