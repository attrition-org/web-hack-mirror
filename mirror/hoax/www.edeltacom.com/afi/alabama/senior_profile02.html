<P>It would seem unlikely that someone who did not step foot on the competitive playing field until his junior year in high school would walk-on the Auburn football team and eventually become a starter for the highly respected Auburn defense. But like the cliche goes, nothing is impossible, and senior free safety Adlai Trone has undoubtedly proved that you can make the unlikely a reality.
<P>Like most young boys, the Birmingham, Ala., native played Pop Warner football. Trone fondly remembers his time as a wide receiver and cornerback for the Central Park Wolverines. 
<P>"We were real good. Our colors were blue and orange and we had the helmet just like Michigan," Trone said. "Those were the days. It was so much fun and I had really great hands."
<P>Though he enjoyed his time as a youth player, Trone did not play again until he joined the Hewitt-Trussville High School team the year before his graduation. 
<P>In preparation for his first high school season before his junior year, Trone joined the wrestling team to improve his mental and physical shape.
<P>"I didn't know all the moves that the good wrestlers knew, but I was pretty good for my weight category," Trone said. "I did body slam a couple of folks."
<P>Because of his late start compared to other high school players, Trone was not highly recruited for collegiate football. So, when he arrived on the Plains in the fall of 1996, Trone walked on as a member of the scout team.
After three years of service at defensive back and special teams, Trone earned a scholarship at the beginning of this season and started his first game for the Tigers as a free safety against Appalachian State.
<P>He has had nothing short of an impressive senior season, recording 47 tackles and breaking up five passes through the first 10 games of the season. After a career game against Tennessee, where he tallied eight tackles, grabbed an interception and recovered a fumble, Trone posted a career-high ten tackles against Arkansas three weeks ago. 
<P>Energy and enthusiasm is something Trone does not lack. It is part of his repertoire that has brought him from a walk-on to starter. As a child Trone was the same way. He didn't spend much time watching television. Instead, he played away many afternoons outdoors.
<P>"I couldn't sit down. I had a lot of energy," Trone said. "I used to like to ride a bike, run around, whatever I had to do."
<P>That same energy drives Trone in his off the field experiences as well.
<P>Trone just completed a year of service as President of his fraternity, Alpha Kappa Si. And while he enjoyed the time in office, Trone is happy just helping the new fraternity brothers now.
<P>"I was honored to serve as president and it was a great experience, but I am glad it is over," Trone said. "Now, I try to spend time with the new guys in the fraternity, trying to show them the do's and don'ts of fraternity life. They are still a little wet-
behind-the-ears."
<P>As the end of his playing days approaches, Trone is already well prepared for the future. Trone recently received his undergraduate degree from Auburn in economics and will enter the Master's of Business Administration program at Auburn in the winter quarter. As for post-graduate plans, Trone hopes to try his hand at Division I coaching.
<P>No matter what path life lays for him, Trone only desires to be happy and to live life to the fullest. With the drive, heart, and determination that he has shown in his four years at Auburn, there should be no doubt that he will fulfill his wishes.
