<P>Whether he is stocking milk cartons in the dairy department at Winn Dixie, working late hours at West-Point Stevens, a textile plant, or making a precise snap back to holder Sammy Manno or punter Damon Duval, senior Gabe Sanders is making the most out of his busy schedule.
<P>Sanders, a senior from Opp, Ala., is the Tigers starting deep snapper and has worked his way from obscurity to a starting role. At one time he was working three jobs, going to school as a full time student, supporting a wife, and playing football as a walk-on for Auburn.
<P>"It's really not that bad working and playing football," Sanders said. "It sounds a whole lot worse than it really is. My wife and I like to have nice things and if that is what it takes to be successful we'll do it. It's hard to be married when you're young. My wife works, but she can't pay all the bills, so I have to help out."
<P>The tables have turned for Sanders, sort of. He now only works two jobs and recently received a scholarship for all his hard work and dedication.
<P>"That was sort of a rush of emotions (receiving a scholarship)," Sanders said. "I would never have expected it because we had already played a couple of ball games this year. It was the Thursday before the LSU game when I found out. It was more of an accomplishment to me than financial help. When you know someone is on scholarship you look at them different, like they are on the next level."
<P>Sanders still holds down two jobs, working in the mornings at Winn Dixie and in the evenings after practice at West-Point Stevens. After going to work for Winn Dixie in the morning, Sanders goes to class until it is time for practice. He handles his duties on the field, then goes to work at night, before finally going home to see his wife, Joy.
<P>"We really only see each other at night and that's about it. It's hard," Sanders said. "She knows it's just temporary, though. She had never come to a college football game before she met me, and when she came to a game she just fell in love with Auburn. This is something that I have always dreamed about, so I think that makes it fun for her too. It takes a lot out of her. She sacrifices a lot for what I do, she knows it will be just us in a couple more weeks."
<P>Sanders worked his way into the starting position this season under the new coaching staff after being an emotional leader for the team the past few years. Auburn fans can usually find Sanders encouraging the crowd for support when he's not snapping.
<P>"I don't have the ability to go out there and play every down. I had to learn a skill like snapping," Sanders said. "If that's my little part, getting the crowd up and getting them behind all my buddies out there on the field - that is something I take pride in. You can never underestimate the power of a cheer."
<P>The love for a school can do many things to a person, and Sanders is a perfect example. He loves to put on the Auburn uniform and there is nothing that will pull him away from it.
<P>"If I had to choose between work and football I would choose to play football," Sanders said. "I can find a way to survive, I will never get this opportunity again to play for Auburn. The chance to play in that stadium (Jordan-Hare) is just an incredible feeling. I would rather have sat the bench here for five years and not ever play, than go to a smaller school and just play."
<P>Despite numerous commitments - his wife, his jobs, his education, and the Auburn football team, Sanders can look back years from now and realize that his time on the Plains was special.
