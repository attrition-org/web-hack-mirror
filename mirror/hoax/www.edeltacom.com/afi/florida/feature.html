<P>The Auburn Motor Home Club has been a part of the Auburn football experience for 21 seasons. The club is comprised of 30 motor homes and the families of its owners. The clubs organizers limited the number of members to help make organization easier, and keep the best interest of Auburn in mind.
<P>"The purpose of the club is to serve the best interest of Auburn University, and represent it well," long-time member George Lawson said. "We are happy to have it and we want people who visit Auburn to leave feeling the way we do about Auburn."
<P>The club currently has a waiting list for future members. Although the club limits it's number of members, it does not limit those who enjoy in their experience.
<P>"We invite guests from other schools to join us. In addition students, coaches, and faculty of the University join us regularly," Lawson added. 
<P>The Auburn Motor Home Club is also a favorite of Auburn Athletic Director David Housel. 
<P>"The Auburn Motor Home Club represents some of Auburn's most supportive fans," Housel said. "I have brought people from the NCAA, Nebraska, Notre Dame and numerous other schools to visit with the club and enjoy their game day breakfast. Their breakfast is to South Auburn what Toomer's lemonade is to North Auburn."
<P>One of the advantages of the club is meeting people from around the country who share the motor home experience. 
<P>"We enjoy it whether we are in Auburn or on the road," Ramon Lowry said. "We have learned the best places to park over the years and the people look forward to our arrival, just as we enjoy it when they come to Auburn."
<P>Club members also enjoy some of the best places to eat around the Southeastern Conference. Each Friday before games, at home or on the road, the club goes to dinner as a group. Some of the clubs' favorite spots are Taylor's Catfish in Oxford, Mike Anderson's Restaurant in Baton Rouge, Calhoun's on the River in Knoxville, and Mississippi State's cafeteria. 
<P>"It's great, the people get to know us wherever we go and are always so friendly," Lawson said. "One morning in Starkville, Miss., we went to the cafeteria for some of their wonderful omelettes. When we got there they weren't open and we were all disappointed. As I was peering in the window the manager recognized us and invited us all in for breakfast."
<P>The Motor Home Club holds meetings in the summer and has its big meeting following the annual A-Day game. It's at this meeting that the club elects officers which will be responsible for coordinating the clubs' travel plans and activities for the coming season. 
<P>The Auburn Motor Home Club is also dedicated to making Auburn a better place for its alumni and student's. Most all of the clubs' members donate money to the university on a yearly basis. 
<P>In addition, the club presents the remainder of its dues to David Housel at one of its game day breakfasts. 
"They have been so generous in their donations to the Athletic Department," Housel said. "We have used the funds to establish many initiatives in our athletic department."
<P>It is safe to say that the Auburn Motor Home Club is an important part of the Auburn game day experience. It is comprised of people who take pride in making Auburn a favorite place for people to visit.
