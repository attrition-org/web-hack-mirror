<P>The strive for perfection in the sport of gymnastics is the dream of all gymnasts when they first enter the gym, and only few are able to accomplish the feat of scoring a perfect 10. For senior gymnast Sarah Wentworth, the dream is getting, oh, so close. 
<P>"Of course, it is a goal for me," Wentworth said. "I have been working hard on some new moves and new dismounts all summer trying to get stronger. The skills will give me a higher start value plus the skills look better to the judges than the one's I did last year."
<P>With better skills and more practice, Wentworth will surpass what she accomplished last season. She led the team on all events except the vault, and set team records on the bars (9.950) and in the all-around (39.425). Wentworth's dream for perfection almost came true during last year's campaign. She scored a 9.900 or better 13 times on the bars, beam and floor, with some routines just a step away from glory.
<P>"It was a little frustrating last season, I would finish a routine and would think this would be the one, and then get a low score," the Neosho, Missouri native said. "Then when I had a routine where I didn't think I did that well they would score me high, so I try not to think about it. I just go out and do my set and let the judges decide what I score."
Only one gymnast in Auburn history has scored a ten. Becky Erwin did it on the floor in 1993.

<P>"It would be nice to become a part of Auburn history. I know what people expect of me and I really just want to go out and do whatever I can to help the team," Wentworth said. 
<P>Along with the hope of scoring a ten Wentworth would also like to see the team reach new heights. Last year the Tigers advanced to the NCAA Regionals for the first time since 1996, and finished 24th in the nation. 
<P>"I would like to see us improve on our consistency early in the season," Wentworth said. "If the judges see us early on and see that we are good they are more likely to give out higher scores later in the year. This is going to be an awesome season and I can't wait."
<P>As one of only two seniors that will see action this season, and the only member of the team that has made a trip to the NCAA Finals, Wentworth will be looked upon for leadership.
<P>"Nationals was a learning experience for myself last year," the pre-vet major said. "It helped me to see how the teams worked together and it gave me some insight that I can hopefully pass along to my teammates so that we can reach the Finals."
<P>Reaching the NCAA Finals just might be something that is in Auburn's grasp this year or in the near future. The Tigers are off to a fresh start, with an almost new coaching staff and the anticipation of a brand new practice facility that began construction yesterday. 
<P>"We have started working on routines much earlier this season than in the past," the All-SEC gymnast said. "The new staff has come in and started working us hard and are helping us put in new harder skills."
