<P>Auburn plays its third top 20 team in a row, hosting the seventh-ranked Florida Gators at Jordan-Hare Stadium.  The game is being televised by ESPN.
<P><B>High Rankings</B>
<BR>The Auburn-Florida game marks the 25th time in the series that one of the teams comes into the contest ranked in the top 10. The first matchup featuring a top ten team was Auburn's 1957 national championship season when the Tigers, ranked fourth, defeated 19th-ranked Florida 13-0. Since 1983, one of the teams has been ranked in the top 11 in 14 of 16 games.
<P><B>Tigers' Third-Longest Rivalry</B>
<BR>Prior to this season, Auburn and Florida had met 75 times, with the Tigers holding a 40-33-2 record. The series between the schools is the third longest in Auburn's history. Only Georgia (102) and Georgia Tech (90), have played the Tigers more times. 
<P><B>Auburn-Florida Series Notes</B>
<BR>Saturday's meeting between Auburn and Florida will mark the 54th consecutive year that the two schools have played each other. Since 1945, Auburn owns a 28-25-1 record ... Auburn leads the series 23-7-1 in games played in Auburn ... Florida leads the series 7-2 in the 1990s ... The winner in the last nine meetings has scored at least 24 points ... Nine games in the last 20 seasons have been decided by seven points or less ... Florida's current four-game winning streak in the series ties its longest, equalling the four consecutive games it won from 1973-76.
<P><B>Three Consecutive Ranked Foes</B>
<BR>For just the fifth time in the history of the program and the first time since 1987, Auburn will play three consecutive ranked teams during the regular season. The Tigers faced seventh-ranked Tennessee, 14th-ranked Mississippi State and will take on seventh-ranked Florida Saturday.
Auburn played three consecutive ranked teams in five other regular seasons:  1987 (#19 Florida, #4 Florida State, #8 Georgia), 1983 (#5 Florida, #7 Maryland, #4 Georgia), 1972 (#4 Tennessee, #18 Ole Miss, #8 LSU), 1968 (#9 Miami, #20 Florida, #5 Tennessee) and 1953 (#15 Ole Miss, #13 Miss. State and #6 Georgia Tech).
<P><B>Brumbaugh, Carson Enjoy Gators</B>
<BR>Senior defensive linemen Jimmy Brumbaugh and Leonardo Carson have had big performances during their careers against Florida.
Last season, Carson had 11 tackles, including one for loss at Gainesville. As a junior he recorded seven stops.
Prior to missing last season's Florida game with an injury, Brumbaugh had 11 tackles and one for loss in the 1997 meeting with the Gators. He also made nine and six stops, respectively, in the 1995 and 1996 meetings between the two schools.
Brumbaugh has averaged eight tackles per game against Florida, while Carson has notched six a game versus the Gators.
<P><B>Daniels Dazzles</B>
<BR>Wide receiver Ronney Daniels had another outstanding performance in the Tigers' loss to Mississippi State. Daniels had four catches for 113 yards, including an amazing 64-yard touchdown catch. 
As he eluded would-be tacklers on his way to the endzone against the Bulldogs, Daniels lost his left shoe at the 25-yard line.
Daniels now has two 100-yard receiving games this season. He had 120 yards at LSU. 
Daniels is only the second true freshman in Auburn history to total two 100-yard receving games. Freddy Weygand also accomplished the feat in 1984.
He is also the first Auburn receiver to collect two or more 100-yard receiving games in a season since Karsten Bailey had two last season.
<P><B>Three Dot Daniels Notes</B>
<BR>With five touchdowns this season, Daniels became the first true freshman to register five or more touchdowns since current Tiger Markeith Cooper had five as a true freshman in 1996 ... With two 100-yard receiving games, he is the 12th Tiger in school history to accomplish the feat ... His 22.2 yards per reception, is currently fourth on the all-time single-season list ... With an average of 77.7 receiving yards per game, he is on pace to have 854 receiving yards this season ... That total would represent the fourth best single-season total in school history, and would place him 19th on the all-time receiving yards list ... Daniels 120 receiving yards against LSU were the most by an Auburn receiver since Clifton Robinson had 130 against LSU last season.
<P><B>Duval Connects</B>
<BR>Freshman placekicker Damon Duval hit three consecutive field goals against Mississippi State, becoming the Tigers' first kicker with three field goals in a game since Rob Bironas had three against Tennessee in 1998.
His eight punts for a 47.9 yard average against the Bulldogs was a personal best in an Auburn uniform and his 67-yard punt in the first half was the longest by an AU punter since Terry Daniel's 71-yarder against Florida in 1993.
<P><B>Auburn Noteables</B>
<BR>Auburn is allowing just one interception per 24.9 pass attempts this season, compared to one interception per 15.4 attempts last season after six games ... After six games this year, Auburn has 12 turnovers compared to 28 giveaways through six games last year ... Auburn has not lost a fumble in two consecutive games ... The Auburn defense has held four of its six opponents to less than 60 yards rushing.
