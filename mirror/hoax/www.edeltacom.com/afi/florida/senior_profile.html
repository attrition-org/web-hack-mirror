<P>On Saturday afternoons in the fall, the sun beats down and casts a shadow across the playing field of Jordan-Hare Stadium. For over 100 years, young men have shed blood, sweat and tears making memories for not only themselves, but also for the thousands of Auburn faithful who live out their dreams of glory on the field with them. 
<P>Many men have laced up their cleats and tramped down the ramp into Jordan-Hare Stadium to the roar of the crowd and the beat of the drum. And there have been numerous with the heart and determination of senior Dave Beasley.
<P>Born Thomas David Beasley, he grew up in Brentwood, Tenn., and his parents Chip and Carolyn Beasley did their best to raise him to be an honorable and hard working man. 
<P>"My parents have probably had the most influence on my life," Beasley said. "They brought me up in the church, and that is the most important thing in my life." 
<P>Beasley said the thing he admired most about his parents was that they allowed him to make a lot of his own decisions, especially since he has been in college. 
<P>"They taught me to be accountable for my mistakes and learn from them," Beasley added.
<P>While playing football at Brentwood High School, Beasley was named to the All-Region and All-County teams, as well as serving as team captain. 
<P>"I was not anything special and I did not get any special treatment because I was captain of the team," the senior tight end said. "I was just a regular guy having fun and hanging out with my friends."
<P>Although Beasley seems humble about his high school playing days, he was offered scholarships to play football at a few Division II and Division III schools. 
<P>"I wanted to go to a big school," Beasley said. "I narrowed it down between Tennessee and Auburn. A lot of my friends were going to Tennessee and I wanted to branch out and meet new people and be open to new experiences, so I chose to come to Auburn. School came first, but I really missed playing football and I decided to walk-on at Auburn. It is a decision I will never regret."
<P>In 1996, against Fresno State, Beasley stepped onto the grass of Jordan-Hare for the first time. He was playing on the kickoff team and ran down the field as hard as he could to make the play. 
<P>"I was able to get a tackle and it worked out well because I was rewarded the next week with a little more playing time," Beasley said.
This fall, Beasley was awarded a scholarship for his hard work and determination. 
<P>"When I walked on, I came in with the attitude that things would be tough. I was never expecting to get a scholarship. I was here to play football."  
<P>Beasley does not consider himself an outspoken person.
<P>"I really do not feel like I have the right to really get on someone about anything." 
<P>What Beasley does do speaks volumes more than any amount of yelling or prodding could ever do. 
<P>"If you have a couple of guys who are working hard in the off season and lifting weights and doing their best and not complaining, I feel the guys will take notice." 
<P>In this, Beasley's final season to wear the Auburn uniform, he says he has have no regrets about his time at Auburn.
<P>"I just thank God for giving me the opportunity and allowing me to even get to play a little bit," Beasley said. "It has been an experience that I would not trade for the world." 
<P>Dave Beasley is not the first, nor will he be the last young man to close a chapter of his life here on the Plains. 
As the roar of the crowd dies down behind him and he looks at his faded jersey hanging in the locker, is it really Beasley who should be honored that he was afforded the opportunity to play for Auburn? Or should the Auburn faithful feel honored that a young man like Thomas David Beasley played for them?
