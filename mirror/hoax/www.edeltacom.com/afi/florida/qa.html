<P><h3>Eric Shore:  Men's Tennis Coach</h3>
<P>
<B>What did the team learn last year that they can bring to this year?</B>
<BR><I>"Obviously, they gained a lot of match experience. We had four freshmen playing in the top six and just competing in the SEC with nine ranked teams will make you grow up pretty quick. I think that will benefit us this year, plus, we have a couple of guys that are healthy again that were not last year. Both had to play hurt and having them back is going to make a big difference this year, we hope."</I>

<P><B>Who are the players to watch for?</B>
<BR><I>"We've got Steve Huss back from last year who was redshirted with an injury. Steve played No. 2 singles for us the past two years on two teams that advanced to the quarterfinals and round of sixteen at the NCAA Championships. He brings a lot of experience back in both singles and doubles. He played No. 1 doubles and was an All-American along with being an NCAA Tournament player in singles. He is going to help us a great deal."</I>

<P><B>Who will be the leader of the team this year?</B>
<BR><I>"I think Huss will be our leader. He is one of only two seniors on the team. A couple of weeks ago, he and Tiago won the National Clay Courts. That is the first national championship ever for Auburn in tennis. That's a big win for us and that just sets a tone for the year, we hope."</I>

<P><B>What is your favorite thing about coaching here at Auburn?</B>
<BR><I>"That's a tough question. I just like working with the guys along with coaching and competing in the SEC Ð the best conference in the country. Some people don't understand how competitive it is. Everybody says its tough in every sport in the SEC, but if people really and truly look at men's tennis, it  is one of the toughest. We've got nine teams in the top 25. I don't know another sport that can say that. When you finish seventh or eighth in the conference, you're a top 25 team."

<P><B>How does it feel coming off your first NCAA appearance?  </B>
<BR><I>"I thought it was a great accomplishment for the program last year. It was certainly something that was a bit unexpected. We thought we had a shot after a couple of good wins early in the season, but being in such a strong conference, you never know how many they are going to take. For us to get in speaks volumes about the strength of the conference and all that goes into selecting the teams, but we were very pleased about getting in. We lost in the first round and we need to do better and improve upon that this year."</I>

<P><B>Talk about the strength of the Southeastern Conference.</B>
<BR><I>"The SEC is without a doubt the toughest in the country. Eleven out of the twelve teams in the conference made the NCAA tournament last year, which is unprecedented in any sport. That speaks volumes of the power and strength of our conference. If you are in the middle of the pack in this conference, you are going to be finishing in the top 20 in the country and that is something a lot of people don't realize."</I>

<P><B>What are things you tell your recruits when they are looking at Auburn?</B>
<BR><I>I think first of all, academically, Auburn is one of the better institutions in the country. When we get them on the campus they see what a beautiful campus we have. It has a tremendous academic and athletic reputation not only in the Southeastern part of the United States, but within the country. The competition is going to be there from an athletic standpoint and the competition is also going to be there from an academic standpoint. Auburn University offers them the best of both worlds. Auburn really sells itself."</I>
