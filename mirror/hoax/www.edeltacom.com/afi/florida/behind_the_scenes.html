<P>Auburn's defensive tackles coach Don Dunn has already won a national championship, not on the football field, but surprisingly for his cooking.
<P>"I don't golf or hunt during my free time," Dunn said. "I go outside and cook out on my barbecue grill."
<P>In 1997, Dunn along with defensive ends coach Terry Price, assistant to the head coach Andy Lutz, director of football operations Eldon Hawley and Ole Miss strength coach Benjy Pierce teamed up as the "Pig Skins" in the annual "Memphis in May" barbecue cook-off. Coined the "Pig Skins" to coincide with the football term and the pork and skins of cooking, the quintet supplied the contest with a vinegar-based barbecue sauce that won best in show.
<P>After coaching high school for four years in Tennessee, Dunn got into coaching at the junior college level in North Carolina.  Dunn returned to Tennessee three years later to serve as a graduate assistant at the University of Tennessee.
<P>Following his assistantship in Knoxville, Dunn moved across the country to the western United States where he coached at Montana State, Pacific, and Nevada-Reno and dealt with what he was not accustomed to in the South.
"You just have to adapt to the weather out there," Dunn said. "I was at the coldest game of my life and it was at least 15 degrees below zero and only the coaches' wives were left in the stands watching the game."
<P>Dunn eventually came back across the country to the hot and humid south when he went to coach for Tommy Tuberville at Ole Miss.
<P>"I prefer the warmer weather of the South," Dunn said. "It doesn't get any better than Auburn."
As Dunn talks about his journey to Auburn, he feels lucky to be here. 
<P>"I have enjoyed every place I've coached at," Dunn said. "But there is something about Auburn. It is a great community and university with great schools and great people. It's a good place for my family."
<P>His family also reaps the benefits of his off the field talents. Whenever he has a chance, Dunn tries to do the cooking at his house and you'll hear no complaints from his family.
<P>"Our son loves it when Don cooks," wife Dona Dunn said. "He's a better cook than I am. It has become a hobby for him and it helps him relax. He even cleans up when he gets done so I love it when he's home."
<P>Dunn's on the field talents can be seen in the way he relates to his players. As Dunn thinks back to his own playing career he recalls that, as a player, you are always worried about the present and what is at hand, rather than focusing on the long-term picture. Dunn hopes he can show his players that what matters is not just "the moment," but what you learn "after the fact."
<P>As for Dunn's off the field talents, he credits much of his cooking success to his grill named "Big Bertha." "Bertha" was created by Lutz's dad, Don, from farm equipment. He made two grills out of a tank and kept one for himself and gave the other to Dunn, whose grill was getting worn out. The grill has since traveled to Nevada, Mississippi, and is now resting comfortably in Dunn's backyard in Auburn. 
<P>"Whenever we are serious about cooking, we don't mess around with those smaller grills. We fire up 'Bertha,'" Dunn said.
<P>The coaches still get together in Dunn's backyard whenever they have a free moment and do quite a bit of cooking. Each one secretly claims to be the best cook. Although to make their award-winning sauce, just like in football, each one had their own duty and had to work together as a team.
<P>During the "Memphis in May" cook-off there was near disaster at the competition. Believing they were out of the competition, the group consumed all of the sauce. When informed by the judges that they advanced to the finals, the "Pig Skins" in two-minute drill fashion, came through in the clutch to create the winning sauce. 
<P>Whether he's winning on or off the field, Dunn's philosophy remains the same. You can enjoy the moment, but you have to savor the taste.
