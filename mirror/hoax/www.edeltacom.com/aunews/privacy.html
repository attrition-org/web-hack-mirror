 This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for Auburn Network On-Line which will tell you:
<p>
<ol>
<li> What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personal information is collected from you through the web site
<li> The organization collecting the information 
<li> How the information is used 
<li> With whom the information may be shared 
<li> What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information? 
<li> How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 
</ol> 
<p>
 If you feel that Auburn Network On-Line is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should contact <a href=mailto:bharris@aunetwork.com>privacy@aunetwork.com</a>.
<p>
 Personal information we collect from you 
<p>
In order to experience our multimedia content (with a few exceptions), a user must first complete the registration form.  During registration a user is required to give basic information. Here’s a rundown of what information we collect and why we collect it:
<p>
Email address: you have the right to know that someone (hopefully you) registered on Auburn Network On-Line with your email address. If it wasn’t you, then we want you to know about it, and we can’t do that without knowing your email address.
<p>
Zip code: our viewers want to see relevant advertising while they’re experiencing our content, and we use your zip code to enable that feature. Also, knowing non-personal information about where you live allows us to know what kind of local and regional events you’d like to see, without violating your privacy.
<p>
Password: we believe that our users should be in charge of their accounts. Passwords enable you to control who in your family watches our events. 
<p>
Are you 13 or older?: recent laws do not allow Internet companies to collect personal information from those younger than 13 years of age. If you’re less than 13, you can have an approving adult or guardian register for you.
<p>
 It is optional for the user to provide any other personal information (such as name and street address), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.
<p>
 <B>Registration</B> 
<p>
The information discussed above is involved with registering you to experience our content.
<p>
IF YOU DON’T REALLY WANT A REGISTRATION: You’ve changed your mind about our Internet entertainment, you can de-activate your membership by going to this address
<p>
<a href=http://www.liveonthenet.com/tickets/editacct.cgi target=top>http://www.liveonthenet.com/tickets/editacct.cgi</a>
<p>
and log into the system and proceed to deactivate your account there.
<p>
VIEWING OUR MULTIMEDIA CONTENT: When you registered, you entered a password to access all our events.  If you have misplaced your password you may go to this address to retrieve it:
<p>
<a href=http://www.liveonthenet.com/0/findticket/ target=top>http://www.liveonthenet.com/0/findticket/</a>
<p>
Your information is stored in a database on our server and no one else is allowed to use it or look at it. By giving us this information, you are allowing it to be used ONLY in the following three ways:
<p>
<ol>
<li> To display advertising to you that you want to see<br>
<li> To create a “cookie” on your computer (see below)<br>
<li>To allow you to edit your information (see below)
</ol>
 <p>
<B> Cookies </B>
<p>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on your computer (not ours).  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information.  If you set your browser to allow cookies, you’ll save time by going directly to events without signing in every time you wish to view content on our site (your cookie is the way that our computers “remember” that you’ve already been verified to view events). If you don’t allow cookies on your computer, you may still use our site, but you’ll have to sign in every time you wish to view multimedia content. 
<p>
 <B>Editing your information </B>
<p>
As mentioned above, we store your registration information on our server. No one else has access to it. One of the reasons for storing this information is to allow you to change it at any time. This feature will allow you to update your email address (if you happen to change it), or update your zip code.
<p>
To change your password or any of your user information, use the procedure below:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Go to this URL: <a href=http://www.liveonthenet.com/tickets/editacct.cgi target=top>http://www.liveonthenet.com/tickets/editacct.cgi</a><br>
<li> Enter in your registration email address and password to login<br>
<li> Once entered correctly, your account information will be displayed and you will be able to edit any of this information or disable your Auburn Network On-Line/LiveOnTheNet.com account
</ol>
<p>
 <B>Sharing </B>
<p>
We will share only aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This data is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. For instance, a record label might want to know the zip code of the majority of the viewers watching a particular event.
<p>
 <B>Links </B>
<p>
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Auburn Network On-Line and LiveOntheNet.com are not and cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage our viewers to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Auburn Network On-Line and LiveOnTheNet.com.
<p>
 <B>Surveys & Contests </B>
<p>
From time-to-time our site sponsors surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary.  Information asked for these contests may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of Auburn Network On-Line.
<p>
 <B>Security </B>
<p>
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.
<p>
All of our users’ information is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, in a locked room.
<p>
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href=mailto:bharris@aunetwork.com>privacy@aunetwork.com</a>.
<p>
<B> Correction/Updating Personal Information: </B>
<p>
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us.  This can usually be done at
:<p>
<a href=http://www.liveonthenet.com/tickets/editacct.cgi target=top>http://www.liveonthenet.com/tickets/editacct.cgi</a>
<p>
 different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.
