<p><b>March 26, 2000</b></p>


<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  Auburn junior second baseman Dominic Rich hit a two-out double down the right field line scoring runners on first and second, as the eight-ranked Tigers defeated No. 12 Georgia, 9-8, in 10 innings. Auburn improved to 26-6 and 6-3 in the Southeastern Conference, while Georgia fell to 16-10 overall and 5-4
in the SEC.
<p>
        Rich's game-winning hit was set up by designated hitter Chris Beaird and shortstop Jonathan Schuerholz' two-out walks. With a full count, Schuerholz fouled off three pitches before drawing a free pass off Bulldog pitcher Jeffery Carswell. Rich ripped Carswell's first offering into right field, scoring pinch runner Lynn Shoop and Schuerholz.
<p>
        Trailing 7-3 in the seventh, Auburn rallied scoring four runs to tie the contest. The inning was highlighted by right fielder Hayden Gliemmo's two-run triple to the right field corner scoring Brett Burnham and Todd Faulkner. Gliemmo scored to tie the game when Beaird singled with the Georgia infield in. Gabe Gross led off the inning, reaching on an error and scoring on a Faulkner double.
<p>
        The win was Auburn's 12th straight over Georgia dating back to 1997 and its second consecutive conference sweep in as many weeks. Auburn won three at Arkansas last weekend.
<p>
        Georgia took an 8-7 lead in the 10th inning when Andy Noufield scored on Brian Rainwater's single to left field. Rainwater led the Bulldogs, going 3-for-3 on the day with three walks and two runs.
<p>
        Faulkner led the Auburn bats, going 3-for-3 with four RBI and a first-inning three-run home run. It was Faulkner's team leading 13th homer of the season. Gabe Gross was 2-for-4 with two runs, and finished the series 8-for-12 with four doubles, a home run and 11 RBI.
<p>
        Colter Bean (6-1) picked up the win in four innings of relief. Bean gave up one run and six hits, while striking out two. The victory was Bean's sixth of the season, establishing a single-season best for the senior.

<p>Carswell (1-2) was credited with the loss for
the Bulldogs.  Carswell allowed two runs on one hit while walking three in 1.1 innings.
<p>
        Auburn will travel to Montgomery's Paterson Field on Tuesday for a non-conference game with Troy State at 6 pm. LSU will come to Auburn next weekend for a three-game set, beginning Friday at 7:30 pm at Plainsman Park. Airtime on the Auburn Network for the LSU game is 7:15 pm.
