<p><b>KNOXVILLE, TN</b>-  Gabe Gross' double to right-center field in
the 10th inning scoring Mailon Kent from first base proved to be the
game winner as Auburn defeated Tennessee, 4-3, in the series opener
Friday evening.  The 11th-ranked Tigers improved to 32-10 overall and
9-7 in the SEC, while the Vols dropped to 32-12 and 6-8 in the
conference.
<p>
        After Dominic Rich led off the 10th inning grounding out to
first, Kent singled, setting up Gross' game winning hit.  Auburn is a
perfect 3-0 in extra-inning games this season.
<p>
        Reliever Colter Bean (7-1) went four innings for the victory,
allowing just one hit while striking out six.  Tennessee had a pinch hit
double with two outs in the bottom of the 10th from Brandon Hopkins, but
teammate Justin Parker ended the game on a ground out to first base.
<p>
        Auburn jumped on the scoreboard early, taking a 3-0 lead by the
third inning.  Mailon Kent hit his seventh home run of the season, with
one out in the first inning.  Kent's home run increased his hitting
streak to a career-best 18 games.
<p>
        Todd Faulkner scored the Tigers' second run of the inning on
Hayden Gliemmo's two-out single to right field.  Faulkner reached on a
fielder's choice and advanced to second on Brett Burnham's walk.
<p>
        Faulkner gave Auburn its third run of the game on a solo home
run to right-center field, his 17th of the season.  He also extended his
hitting streak to a career-best 14 games. 
<p>
        Tennessee scored two runs in the bottom of the third on Stevie
Daniels' triple down the right field line.  Jef Baumtrog and Chris Burke
each scored on the play.  The Vols picked up another run in the fourth
inning on Ryan Moffett's RBI single, scoring Justin Parker from third
base.
<p>
        Jamie Bennett (7-2) was credited with the loss for the Vols,
going the entire 10 innings, allowing four runs on eight hits, while
striking out nine.  Auburn starter Levale Speigner went a career-best
six innings, allowing 11 hits and three runs.   
<p>
        Auburn and Tennessee will play the second game of their
three-game set on Saturday beginning at 4 p.m. CT at Lindsey Nelson
Stadium. Airtime on the Auburn Network set for 3:45 pm. You can listen to Auburn Baseball live by tuning in to your local <a href=../../../affiliate/main_affiliate.html>Auburn Network affiliate</a> or by visiting our <a href=../../../liveaudio/main_liveaudio.html>Live Audio</a> section.
