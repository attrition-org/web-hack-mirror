<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  LSU's Mike Fontenot and Wally Pontiff each hit home runs in the sixth inning to rally the 11th-ranked Fighting Tigers to a 12-10 victory over sixth-ranked Auburn, today. LSU improved to 21-10 overall and 7-4 in the SEC, while Auburn dropped to 28-8 overall and 7-5 in the conference.
<p>Trailing 8-6 entering the sixth, LSU posted six runs on seven hits. Fontenot hit a one-out solo homer cutting the Auburn lead to one. With two outs, Brad Hawpe singled and scored when Blair Barbier followed with a double to left-center field, tying the game at eight apiece.
<p>LSU took the lead for good when Pontiff followed Barbier with a home run to right field. The home run was Pontiff's second in as many innings, after leading off the fifith with a solo shot to right field.
<p>Auburn freshman Brett Burnham hit a no-out grand slam home run in the bottom of the fifith inning, to give the Tigers a short-lived 8-6 lead. The home run was Burnham's first of his career.
<p>Auburn scored two more runs in the sixth, cutting the LSU advantage to 12-10, but could not score in the ramaining three innings as LSU reliever Shane Youman allowed just one Auburn batter to reach base.
<p>Reliever Heath McMuray (1-1) was credited with the win for the Fighting Tigers, allowing six runs on seven hits in 2.2 innings of relief.
<p>Brandon Mayfield (4-1) picked up his first loss on the season for Auburn. The senior gave six runs on seven hits including three home runs in 2.1 innings of work.
<p>LSU received three hits from Hawpe, Jeff Lipari, and Ray Wright. Wright added four RBI, with Pontiff chipping in three. Catcher Brad Cresse increased his career-best hitting-streak to 23 games with a single in the third.
<p>Auburn's top five in the batting order: Dominic Rich, Mailon Kent, Gabe Gross, Todd Faulkner, and Burnham each had two hits. Burnham had four RBI, while Kent added three runs and two RBI.
<p>Auburn returns to action Tuesday at Plainsman Park with a non-conference game against Mercer at 6 pm in Plainsman Park. The Tigers will resume SEC play next weekend at Ole Miss.
