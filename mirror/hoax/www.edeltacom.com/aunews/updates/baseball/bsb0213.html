<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  Behind a seven run second inning, the 11th ranked Auburn Tigers defeated Furman, 10-4, giving Auburn head coach Hal Baird his 600th career victory at Auburn.  With the three-game sweep of the Paladins, the
Tigers improved to 7-0, while Furman dropped to 2-5 overall.  

<P>"We had a big inning in the second which helped," Baird said. "Hayden (Gliemmo) threw very well and we had some good plays defensively.  We didn't only make the routine plays, but we made great plays as well."

<P>Baird, who will retire at the conclusion of the 2000 season has compiled a 600-308 mark in 16 seasons on the Plains.
        
<P>"That's a nice milestone and I feel very good about it," Baird said.

<P>Following a run in the top of the second by the Paladins, Auburn responded with seven runs in the bottom of the inning.  With one out, junior 1B Todd Faulkner hit a solo home run to right field, his third of the season and second in as many days.  Four runs and seven batters later, sophomore OF Gabe Gross hit his third homer of the season, a two-run homer over the right center field wall.

<P>Freshman IF Jonathan Schuerholz's single in the seventh inning scored Faulkner and IF Chris Beaird, giving the Tigers a 10-2 lead.  Furman scored two in the top of the eighth to complete the scoring.
 
<P>The Tigers' 51 runs in the three-game series with Furman are the most runs scored by an Auburn team in a three-game series.  In 1994, Auburn scored 44 runs against Georgia in a three-game set.

<P>Gliemmo (2-0), who won his second consecutive start, pitched six innings, allowing just three hits and one run, while striking out five Furman batters.  Furman's Corey Etheridge (0-2) was credited with the loss, allowing eight hits and seven runs over six innings.

<P>Auburn had 10 hits to Furman's eight, while the Paladin's committed seven errors.  

<P>Auburn will entertain Mercer on Tuesday, February 15 at 3 p.m. at Plainsman Park.  Following a home game against UAB at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, the Tigers will travel to New Orleans to play in the three-day Winn Dixie
Classic in the Louisiana Superdome, Feb. 18-20.
