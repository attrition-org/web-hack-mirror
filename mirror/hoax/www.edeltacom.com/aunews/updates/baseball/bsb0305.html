<p><b>AUBURN</b>- Todd Faulkner hit two home runs and drove in six runs and pitcher Chris Bootcheck struck out 11 batters as the Auburn baseball team swept UNC Charlotte, with a 16-1 victory today.  Auburn improved to 18-3 overall, while UNCC fell to 11-3.
<P>"Our kids played extremely well today," head coach Hal Baird said.  "We had solid play up and down the lineup and Todd (Faulkner) had a career day.  Chris (Bootcheck) was getting ahead in the count and had all of his pitches working."
<P>     After allowing a lead off single, Bootcheck (3-0) proceeded to strike out eight consecutive 49ers.  In seven innings of work, the junior allowed four hits and one earned run.  His 11 strikeouts were a season high.
<P>     The Auburn bats were clicking, as they posted multiple-runs in five of the first six innings.  Faulkner hit his eighth home run of the season in the fifth inning, a two-run shot to left field.  In the sixth, Faulkner followed with a towering three-run homer over the left field monster, his fifth long ball in as many games.
<P>     Faulkner finished the day 5-for-5 with five runs scored and six RBI.  It also marked the third time in his career that he has recorded multiple home run games.  The five hits, five runs, and two home runs all marked single-game career highs for the first baseman.  The five runs also tied a school record held by several individuals.
<P>     Auburn also received a 3-for-4 performance from left fielder Gabe Gross, and two hits apiece from center fielder Mailon Kent and designated hitter Heath Higgins.  Higgins had a career high four RBI.
<P>     Mike Taylor (2-1) was credited with the loss for UNCC.  He allowed six hits, six runs, while walking one in 2.2 innings pitched.  Brian Bowman had two hits for the 49ers.
<P>     Auburn will host Davidson Tuesday at Plainsman Park beginning at 3 p.m. CT.  The Tigers will open Southeastern Conference play this weekend when they host South Carolina, Friday through Sunday.  Friday's contest will begin at 6:30 p.m. in Plainsman Park.
