<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  The 12th-ranked Auburn baseball team got back to business with a 14-7 win over Troy State. The Tigers avenge a 12-5 loss to the Trojans last season in Auburn.  Auburn improves to 15-3 overall, while Troy State fell to 7-6 overall. 

<p>Auburn got off to an early start scoring five runs in the first inning including three from Todd Faulkner's homerun over the green monster. Bobby Huddleston tripled in Gabe Gross for an RBI, then went on to score on a wild pitch by the Trojans. 
<p>Troy State came back with two runs in the second inning. The Tigers answered with an unearned run to score Faulkner in the bottom half on the inning to keep Auburn ahead 6-2.  
<p>The Trojans scored two runs over the next two innings to cut Auburn's lead to 6-4. 
<p>Auburn picked up another run in the fourth inning off a Dominic Rich double to right field to score Jonathan Schuerholz.
<p>The Tigers scored four more runs in the fifth inning. Mailon Kent's 2 RBI double to right center helped put the game out of reach and push the score to 11-4 over the Trojans.
<p>Troy State made one last charge scoring three runs in the seventh inning to cut the lead to 11-7, but Auburn matched those runs with three runs of their own over the seventh and eighth innings to win 14-7.

<p>Auburn first-baseman Todd Faulkner continued to bring power to the plate in leading the Tigers with 3 RBI on 1-for-4 hitting including his sixth homerun of the season. Centerfielder Mailon Kent went 2-for-4 with two doubles and 3 RBI, while shortstop Dominic Rich added 2 RBI on 3-for-5 hitting including a double and two stolen bases. Catcher Bobby Huddleston picked up two hits to extended his hitting streak to a career-best nine games.
<p>Auburn junior Chris Bootcheck started the game, pitching 4.0 innings, giving up two earned runs on nine hits, five strikeouts, and two walks. Brandon Mayfield replaced Bootcheck in the fifth inning to pitch 3.0 innings, giving up three earned runs on two hits, four strikeouts, and two walks. Mayfield picked up the win and improved to 3-0 on the season. Colter Bean came on to pitch the remaining 2.0 innings. Bean gave up no runs on three hits and one strikeout. 

<p>Auburn will host UNC Charlotte in a double header on Saturday. The first game is set to start at 1:00 pm at Plainsman Park.
