<p><b>April 23, 2000</b></p>


<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  Eighth-ranked Auburn overcame two, four-run deficits to
defeat Vanderbilt, 10-8, at Plainsman Park, today.  Gabe Gross was
4-for-4 with four runs, two RBI, and a solo home run and reliever Colter
Bean picked up his eighth win of the season for the Tigers.  Auburn
improved to 36-11 overall and 13-8 in the Southeastern Conference while
Vanderbilt dropped to 19-24 and 5-15 in the conference.
<p>
        For the third consecutive game, the Commordores jumped on the
Tigers early, scoring three runs in the first and two in the second to
take a 5-1 advantage.  After Auburn scored two in the third, Vanderbilt
regained a four-run advantage with two runs in the fourth.
<p>
        Auburn tied the game in the fifth with four runs on four hits. 
Mailon Kent was called out on strikes to lead off the inning and was
ejected for questioning the call.  Auburn followed Kent's ejection with
back-to-back home runs by Gross and Todd Faulkner, to cut the deficit to
7-5.
<p>
        Jonathan Schuerholz' single four batters later, scoring Brett
Burnham and Hayden Gliemmo tied the game at seven.  Burhnam followed
Faulkner's homer with a single and Gliemmo reached on a walk.
<p>
        Vanderbilt recaptured the lead in the sixth as Ulises Cabrera
singled and scored on Ashley Freeman's double to deep centerfield.
<p>
        Dominic Rich led off the Auburn sixth with a walk.  After Rich
stole second with one out, Gross doubled down the right field line,
scoring Rich to tie the game at eight.  Gross advanced to third on
Faulkner's lineout to centerfield and scored when Vanderbilt pitcher
Damon Yee was called for a balk. Gross was attempting to steal home when
Yee was called for the balk.
<p>
        Kent extended his hitting streak to 23 games with a first inning
single.  His streak ties current assistant head coach Steve Renfroe for
the third best hitting streak in school history.  Renfroe had a 23-game
streak in 1977.
<p>
        Faulkner also extended his career-best hitting streak to 19
games with a single in the third inning. He also set an Auburn
single-season record for extra-base hits with his home run.  Faulkner
now has 42 extra-base hits this season.
<p>
        In his third consecutive appearance of the weekend, Bean (8-1)
went 3.1 innings in relief, allowing just two hits and no runs.
<p>
        Yee (5-4) was credited with the loss for the Commordores.  The
Commodores' starter went 7.2 innings allowing 11 hits, 10 runs, nine
earned runs, while walking six and striking out three.
<p>
        Auburn returns to action next weekend when the Tigers travel to
Gainesville, Fla., for a three-game series with the Florida Gators. 
Friday's game at Perry Field will begin at 6 pm CT. Airtime on the Auburn Network set for 5:45 pm. You can listen to Auburn Baseball live in our <a href=../../../liveaudio/main_liveaudio.html>Live Audio</a> section.
