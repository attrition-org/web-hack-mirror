<p><b>July 20, 2000</b></p>


<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  Chris Finwood, who served as an assistant baseball coach
at Virginia Commonwealth University for the last six seasons, has been
named an assistant coach at Auburn University, head coach Steve Renfroe
announced Thursday.  Finwood will be responsible for the Tigers'
defensive efforts while assisting with recruiting.

<P>        An associate head coach at VCU since 1999, Finwood helped guide
the Rams to 219-139 mark in his six seasons.  During his tenure, VCU
claimed Colonial Athletic Association regular season titles in 1997 and
1998, while making consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament in 1998 and
1999.  Finwood assisted the program to consecutive back-to-back 40 win
seasons in 1998 and 1999, including a school-record 46 wins in 1998. 

    <P>    "We are thrilled to have Chris Finwood as part of the Auburn
baseball program,"  Renfroe said.  "We have competed against his teams
in the past and know how good of a coach he is.  Chris is an excellent
infielder coach, a great recruiter and his reputation in the
professional and collegiate baseball ranks is outstanding.  I believe
one of the top coaches in the country has joined our staff."

        <P>A 1988 graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, Finwood was
the head coach of his alma mater from 1990-94.  In 1993, Finwood guided
the Keydets to a school-record 20 wins and an appearance in the Southern
Conference tournament championship game.  Prior to his tenure as head
coach at VMI, Finwood was an assistant at Radford University (1989) and
VMI (1988-89).

<P>        As a player at VMI from 1985-88, Finwood was named to the
Southern Conference all-Northern division team three times as a
shortstop.  A .300 career hitter for the Keydets, Finwood hit .399 as a
senior, the sixth-best mark in school history.    Finwood is also second
in career hits and runs scored at VMI.
