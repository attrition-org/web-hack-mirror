<p><b>March 16, 2000</b></p>


<p><b>KNOXVILLE, Tenn.</b>-  No. 11 Auburn scored seven runs in the third
inning and held on for a 7-6 win over No. 23 Tennessee, to sweep the
three-game series. The win was Auburn's eighth in a row over Tennessee
and the Tigers second consecutive sweep over the Vols.  Auburn improved
to 34-10 overall and 11-7 in the SEC, while the Tennessee dropped to
32-14 and 6-10 in the conference.
<p>
        Auburn jumped on the Vols early, scoring seven runs in the third
inning.  Gabe Gross' no-outs, two-run home run gave the Tigers a 3-0
lead.  Gross' homer was his 11th of the season.  Todd Faulkner singled
and Brett Burnham walked before Hayden Gliemmo singled scoring Faulkner
from second.  
<p>
        Catcher Donnie Streeter's single to score Burnham and Gliemmo
touched home plate on a ground out by John Tyler.  Streeter scored the
Tigers seventh run of the inning from third base on a passed ball.
<p>
        Tennessee responded with two runs in the bottom of the third and
the Vols scored three more in the fourth behind Chri Burke's three-run
homer to left field. The Vols cut the Auburn advantage to 7-6, on Ryan
Case's RBI single with two outs in the fifth scoring Kris Bennett from
second base.
<p>
        Auburn LHP Hayden Gliemmo (3-1) picked up the win, going 4.0
innings, allowing five hits and five runs.  It was just Gliemmo's second
outing after suffering a sprained elbow in mid-February.
<p>
        Brandon Mayfield threw three innings in relief allowing just
three hits and no runs while striking out three.  Mayfield turned the
ball over to Colter Bean in the ninth after allowing a lead-off single
to Brandon Hopkins.  Bean retired the next three batters for his second
save in a many days.  Bean also won Friday evening's contest.
<p>
        The sweep was the Tigers third in conference play this season
and second SEC sweep on the road as they improved to 7-2 on the road in
the SEC.  Auburn swept Arkansas in Fayetteville earlier in the season.
The Tiger also swept Georgia in Auburn.
 <p>
        The Vols' Joe Bertolino (4-2) was credited with the loss,
allowing six runs, four earned, on seven hits.
<p>
        Kent and Faulkner each extended their career-best hitting
streaks to 20 and 16 games, respectively.  Streeter had a career-best
three hits on the day.  Rich also added two hits for the Tigers. 
<p>
        Auburn returns home next weekend, April 21-23, when they host
Vanderbilt for a three-game series.  Friday evening's game at Plainsman
Park begins at 6:30 pm CT.  Airtime on the Auburn Network is 6:15 pm and you can listen to the game live in our <a href=../../../liveaudio/main_liveaudio.html>Live Audio</a> section.
