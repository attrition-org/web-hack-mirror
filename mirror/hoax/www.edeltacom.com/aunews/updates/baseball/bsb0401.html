<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  Auburn pitcher Chris Bootcheck threw a complete-game allowing five hits and one run as the sixth-ranked Tigers defeated 11th-ranked LSU, 7-1, today. It was Bootcheck's third career complete game and first this season. Auburn improved to 28-7 overall and 7-4 in the Southeastern Conference, while LSU fell to 20-10 overall and 6-4 in the conference.
<p>Bootcheck (7-0) allowed just three hits through eight innings and did not allow a base runner past first base until the eighth inning. The win was the junior's third in a row in as many starts.
<p>Bootcheck's shut out was broken up with two outs in the ninth inning when LSU's Brad Cresse's flair double dropped into right field, scoring Ryan Theriot from second base. Cresse's hit improved his career-best hitting streak to 23 games.
<p>The one run scored by LSU was the fewest scored by the Fighting Tigers since losing 7-1 to Mississippi State in 1999.
<p>Auburn got on the scoreboard in the first inning with three runs on four hits. Dominic Rich led off with a double and scored two batters later on Gabe Gross' single. Todd Faulkner followed with a double, scoring Gross, and Faulkner scored on Brett Burnham's RBI single.
<p>LSU's Trey Hodges (2-1) was credited with the loss. Hodges went 3.2 innings, allowing six hits, five runs and five earned runs.
<p>Gross, Faulkner, Hayden Gliemmo, and Jonathan Schuerholz each had two hits for the Tigers. Mailon Kent extended his season-best hitting streak to 11 games with a single in the seventh. Catcher Donnie Streeter also had three sacrifice bunts on the day for Auburn.
<p>The two teams will play the final game of their three-game set tomorrow at Hitchcock Field in Plainsman Park at 1:30 pm. Airtime on the Auburn Network set for 1:15 pm.
