<p><b>GAINESVILLE, FL</b>- Bobby Huddleston's two-run double down the left-field line in the 10th inning led Auburn to an 11-8 win over Florida this evening. The victory was Auburn's fifth in as many tries in extra innings this season. The eigth-ranked Tigers improved to 37-12 overall and 14-9 in the Southeastern Conference, while Florida fell to 32-18-1 overall and 13-9-1 in the conference.
<P>Auburn scored three runs in the 10th, as Brett Burnham and Hayden Gliemmo each reach base on Gator errors. Huddleston followed with the game-winning double and scored three batters later on Dominic Rich's RBI single.
<P>The Tigers led 8-4 in the eigth inning before the Gators rallied for four runs in the inning to tie the game at eight apiece. Florida's inning was highlighted by pinch hitter Matt Gross' three-run home run that tied the game.
<P>Florida jumped out to a three run lead in the first inning behind cleanup hitter Tim Olson's three-run home run to right-center field, however Auburn took a 6-3 lead with a six-run sixth inning. The inning broke an eight-inning scoreless string for the Tigers that dated back to Friday evening's game.
<P>Mailon Kent provided the big hit in the inning, with a grand slam to left field. It was Kent's second grand slam of the season, and improved his hitting streak to 25-games, third best in school history. Kent's hit was the fifth of sixth consecutive hits by Auburn in the inning.
<P>Brett Burnham led off the sixth inning with a double and advanced to third on Hayden Gliemmo's ground out. Bobby Huddleston singled scoring  Burnham, and Chris Beaird, Jonathan Schuerholz and Dominic Rich each singled before Kent's grand slam.
<P>Auburn had timely hitting from its freshman, as the Tiger rookies tallied nine of the teams's 15 hits. Jonathan Schuerholz tied a career high with four hits, while Huddleston added three and Burnham two. Huddleston also added three RBI on the evening. Dominic Rich had three hits and two RBI.
<P>Reliever Brandon Mayfield (6-1) was credited with the win, allowing one hit and one run in 3.0 innings of work. Florida's Jay Belflower (4-3) was credited with the loss. Belflower allowed three hits and three runs, all unearned in 1.2 innings of relief.
