<p><b>April 4, 2000</b></p>


<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  Tenth-ranked Auburn scored 14 runs in the first inning
and starting pitcher Kevin Knorst was one strike away from a no-hitter
as the Tigers defeated Mercer, 19-2, by the mercy rule tonight.  Auburn
improved to 29-7 overall, while Mercer fell to 11-20.
<p>
        Knorst threw 5.2 innings of perfect ball and 6.2 innings of
hitless ball before Mercer designated hitter Brandon Blair hit a
two-strike home run in the seventh inning, breaking up Knorst's
no-hitter.  Blair's homer scored Greg Schmidt who walked earlier in the
inning.
<p>
        Auburn sent 21 batters to the plate in the first inning, as 14
crossed the plate behind seven runs and seven walks and one Mercer
error.   Catcher Donnie Streeter's three-run home run to left field
highlighted the inning for the Tigers.  The home run was Streeter's
first at Auburn.
<p>
        The 14 runs in the inning were the most posted in an inning by
Auburn this season and the most runs in an inning since scoring 14 in
the fifth inning against Morehead State on February 8, 1997. 
<p>
        Todd Faulkner led the Auburn offensive output, going 3-for-4
with five RBI and three runs, while Streeter added a career-high five
RBI.  Freshmen Brett Burnham, Chris Beaird, and Jonathan Schuerholz each
added two hits.
<p>
        Mailon Kent improved his season-best hitting streak to 13 games,
while Gabe Gross extended his hitting streak to 12 games.
<p>
        Knorst's complete game was the second in less than a week by
Auburn pitching.  Chris Bootcheck threw a five-hit complete game versus
LSU last Saturday.
<p>
        Mercer's Mike Navaroli (1-5) was credited with the loss after
lasting just 1/3 of an inning, allowing three hits, eight runs, four
earned runs, while walking four.
    <p>    
        Auburn resumes Southeastern Conference action this weekend when
it travels to Oxford, Miss., for a three-game set this weekend with Ole
Miss.  Friday's game at Oxford-University Stadium will begin at 6:30
pm CT with airtime on the Auburn Network set for 6:15 pm. You can listen to Auburn Baseball live by tuning in to your local <a href=../../../affiliate/main_affiliate.html>Auburn Network affiliate</a> or by visiting our <a href=../../../liveaudio/main_liveaudio.html>Live Audio</a> section.
