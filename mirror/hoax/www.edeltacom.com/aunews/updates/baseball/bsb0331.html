<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  Behind catcher Brad Cresse's 5-for-5 and two home run outing, 11th-ranked LSU defeated sixth-ranked Auburn, 18-11, this evening. LSU improved to 20-9 overall and 6-3 in the Southeastern Conference, while Auburn dropped to 27-7 overall and 6-4 in the SEC.
<p>Auburn opened the game scoring four runs in the bottom of the first, behind catcher Bobby Huddleston's two-out three-run double. LSU responded however with six in the second and three in the third. Cresse gave LSU an 11-4 lead with a two-run home run to center field. The SEC's leading hitter, Cresse improved his career-best hitting streak to 22 games.
<p>Auburn scored five runs in the bottom of the fifth, behind three walks, two hits and one LSU error, cutting the LSU advantage to 11-9. Tigers' third baseman Brett Burnham tripled to left-center field scoring two Auburn runners.
<p>LSU answered, scoring runs in the next four innings, including three in the seventh and two in the ninth. Cresse hit his second two-run home run in the eight inning to right center field. In all, the Tigers scored in six of the nine innings.
<p>LSU reliever Hunter Gomez (4-0) picked up the win for the Tigers. Gomez threw 5.0 innings, allowing six hits, four runs, while walking two and striking out four.
