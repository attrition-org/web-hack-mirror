<p><b>May 6, 2000</b></p>


<p><b>TUSCALOOSA, AL</b>- Auburn's Jonathan Schuerholz belted a grand
slam in the eighth inning to lead the Tigers to a come-from-behind, 6-3,
win over Alabama at Sewell-Thomas Stadium, Saturday afternoon.  With the win, Auburn
improved to 38-14 overall and 15-11 in SEC play while Alabama fell to
34-18 and 14-12 in league play.
<p>
        Auburn trailed 3-2 in the eighth before Brett Burnham, Donnie
Streeter and Hayden Gliemmo drew walks from Alabama reliever Lance
Cormier to load the bases.  After Cormier was replaced by right-hander
Bryce Heath, Scheurholz drove an 0-1 pitch over the right field wall for
his second homer and grand slam of the season.
<p>
        "Heroes come in all shapes and sizes and Jonathan Schuerholz had
his share of big at-bats," head coach Hal Baird said.  "I'm proud of
this team.  This is a hard place to win and it was a big victory for
us."
 <p>
        Alabama grabbed a 2-0 lead early in the game, scoring one run in
the second and third innings.  Ben King hit a solo home run to lead off
the second inning, and the Tide added another run in the third courtesy
of a sacrifice fly by Sam Bozanich that scored Darren Wood.      
<p>
         Auburn tied the game at two in the fifth inning when Todd
Faulkner hit a two-out, two-run home run to right-center field. 
Faulkner drove home Mailon Kent who reached two batters earlier on a
single to left field. Faulkner's homer was his 20th of the season, tying
him for third on the Auburn single-season list.
<p>
        The Tide regained the lead in the seventh after Brent Boyd
tripled and scored on a single by Kelley Gulledge to give Alabama a 3-2
lead heading into the eighth.
<p>
        Auburn reliever Colter Bean (9-3) was credited with the win
after pitching the final 2.1 innings and allowing three hits.  Starter
Chris Bootcheck gave up three runs and three hits and struck out three
in 6.2 innings of work.
   <p>     
        Cormier (5-5) was charged with the loss after allowing three
runs in 0.2 innings of work.
<p>
	The Tigers and Tide will wrap up the series tomorrow, beginning at 1:00 pm CT, at Sewell-Thomas Stadium. Airtime on the Auburn Network set for 12:45 pm. You can listen to Auburn Baseball live in our <a href=../../../liveaudio/main_liveaudio.html>Live Audio</a> section.
