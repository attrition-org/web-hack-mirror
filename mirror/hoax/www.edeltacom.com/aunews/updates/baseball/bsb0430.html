<p><b>GAINESVILLE, FL</b>- Florida's Tim Olson hit a two-run home run in
the eighth inning off Auburn reliever Colter Bean, for the game-winning
hit as the Gators rallied to defeat Auburn, 7-6, at McKethan Stadium,
today. Florida improved to 33-18-1 overall and 14-9-1 in the
Southeastern Conference, while Auburn dropped to 37-13 overall and 14-10
in the SEC.
<p>
        Olson's eighth inning heroics dashed Auburn's hopes for victory
after 
the Tigers overcame a five-run deficit to take a 6-5 lead in the
seventh inning.  Freshman Brett Burnham's three-run home run in the
Auburn seventh gave the Tigers their first lead of the game.
<p>
        Florida led off the game with three consecutive hits, scoring
one run in the inning. Pete Nystrom's solo home run in the second gave
the Gators a two-run advantage.
     <p>   
        The Gators increased their lead to 5-0 in the fifth on Matt
Siegel's three-run home run to right field.  Tony Sacarras led off the
inning reaching when hit by Tiger starter Levale Speigner. Aaron
Sobieraj singled before Siegel homered with two outs, three batters
later.
       <p> 
        Auburn's six-run, seventh started with a lead off single by
catcher Donnie Streeter.  A one-out walk by Jonathan Schuerholz and a
single by Dominic Rich left the bases loaded for Mailon Kent.  Kent
walked, scoring Streeter and Gabe Gross reached on a fielder's choice,
scoring Schuerholz. Todd Faulkner's two-out single scored Rich, and
Burnham followed with his second home run of the season. 
<p>
        Jay Belflower (5-3) was credited with the win for the Gators,
throwing 1.1 innings of scoreless ball.  Bean (8-3) was the loser for
Auburn after allowing two hits on two runs in 1.1 innings. Auburn
starter Levale Speigner went a career-high 6.2 innings for the Tigers. 
<p>
        Todd Faulkner and Dominic Rich each had two hits for Auburn,
while Burnham added three RBI.  Mailon Kent's 25-game hitting streak was
snapped today, as the junior went 0-for-3.
<p>
        Auburn returns to action next weekend, May 5-7, when it travels
to Tuscaloosa, Ala., for a three-game series with Alabama.  Friday
evening's game between the Tigers and Crimson Tide begins at 7 p.m. CT.
