<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  The 12th-ranked Auburn baseball team chalked up two more victories by defeating UNC-Charlotte 12-3 in the first game and 7-1 in the second game of Saturday's doubleheader with the 49ers. The Tigers' bats were hot throughout both games and the pitching was outstanding. Auburn improved to 17-3 overall, while UNC-Charlotte dropped their first two games of the season and fell to 11-2 overall. 

<p>Auburn shortstop Dominic Rich had a huge day, going 8-for-10 for 6 RBI, including two doubles, two triples, and a stolen base. Centerfielder Mailon Kent went 2-for-6 for four RBI and two stolen bases.

<p>First baseman Todd Faulkner moved into a tie for fifth all-time in homeruns with his solo shot to left field in the fifth inning of the first game. This was his seventh of the season and 33rd career homerun. 

<p>Auburn freshman Brent Speigner started the first game, pitching 5.2 innings, giving up one earned run on eight hits, four strikeouts, and one walk. Brent picked up the win and improved to 4-1 on the season. Levale Speigner came in and picked up his first career save, pitching 3.1 innings, giving up no runs on four hits and three strikeouts. 

<p>In the second game, Auburn's Colter Bean got his first career start. He carried a no-hitter into the seventh inning before a lone hit broke it up. Colter struck out six 49ers to pick up his third win of the season. 

<p>First pitch for the last game of the series with UNC-Charlotte is set for 1:30 pm at Plainsman Park. Junior Chris Bootcheck (2-0) will get the start for Auburn.
