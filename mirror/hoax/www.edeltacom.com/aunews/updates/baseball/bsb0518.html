<p><b>HOOVER, Ala.</b>-  Top-ranked South Carolina scored nine runs in the final three innings to break a 2-2 tie and post an 11-4 win over Auburn at the 2000 SEC Baseball Tournament at the Hoover Met. The loss eliminated Auburn from the tournament and dropped the Tigers to 40-18 overall. South Carolina improved to 51-7 overall. 

<P>South Carolina's Brennan Dees hit a two-run single which broke a 2-2 tie as the Gamecocks scored three runs in the sixth inning for a 5-2 lead. After John McHenry led off with a walk, Nate Janowicz followed with a single and Drew Meyer was hit by pitcher Chris Bootcheck. After Dees' single, Brandon Pack hit a sacrifice fly scoring Meyer from third.

<P>After Chris Plummer's solo home run in the eighth for the Gamecocks, Auburn cut the lead to 6-4 in the bottom of the inning on Todd Faulkner's single to center field scoring Chris Beaird and Jonathan Schuerholz. Beaird and Schuerholz led off the eighth with consecutive singles and Gabe Gross walked the bases loaded before Faulkner's two-out hit.

<P>Auburn could get no closer however, as the Gamecocks added five runs in the ninth to pull away for the 11-4 win. The inning began with the first four USC batters reaching base courtesy of two walks and two singles. Trey Dyson's single scored two runs and he later scored on a wild pitch. Chris Plummer drove in a run with a sacrifice fly and Drew Meyer's fielder's choice scored South Carolin's fifth run of the inning.

<P>"It's hard to outhit someone and lose," Auburn head coach Hal Baird said. "South Carolina is a very accomplished and confident team and they play expecting to win.

<P>Peter Bauer(12-1) earned the win for the Gamecocks allowing four runs on seven hits in 7.2 innings. Scott Barber was credited with his 13th save of the season after allowing just one hit while pitching the final 1.1 innings.
