<p><b>GAINESVILLE, FL</b>- Florida scored four runs in the eighth
innings on just one hit and Auburn had a season-low five hits, as the
Gators defeated the Tigers, 5-3, tonight. Florida improved to 31-18-1
overall and 13-8-1 in the Southeastern Conference, while Auburn dropped
to 36-12 and 13-9 in the SEC.
<p>
        Auburn broke a scoreless game in the fourth with three runs on
three hits.   Mailon Kent led off the inning with a single, extending
his career-best hitting streak to 24 games.  Kent's streak is the third
best in Auburn history.  
<p>
        After Gabe Gross walked, Todd Faulkner advanced the runners on a
ground out to the pitcher.  Brett Burnham's sacrifice fly to centerfield
scored Kent from third.  Gliemmo scored Gross on a double to left-center
field, and scored on Bobby Huddleston's single to left.
<p>
        Florida scored an unearned run in the seventh, cutting the
Auburn advantage to 3-1.  Ryan Raburn singled and advanced to second on
an error by Jonathan Schuerholz.  Raburn scored on Kevin Estrada's
single.
<p>
        The Gators sent 10 batters to the plate in the eighth, scoring
four unearned runs on one hit.  The Tigers came unraveled, committing
two errors in the innings, while reliever Colter Bean surrendered four
walks.  All of the Gators runs in the inning came with two outs.  Pinch
hitter Matt Goss' two-run single, scoring Tim Olson and Peter Nystrom
gave Florida a 4-3 lead, proving to be the game winner.
<p>
        Colter Bean (8-2) was credited with the loss for Auburn,
allowing one hit, four runs, while walking four in 1.0 innings of work.
<p>
        Mike Smalley threw a complete-game five hitter for Florida in a
winning effort.  Smalley improved to 4-6 on the season.
       <p>  
        Tiger starter Hayden Gliemmo was outstanding, going 6.0 innings,
while allowing just two hits and no runs. The six innings tied a
season-high for Gliemmo, who went six innings against Furman on February
13.
<p>
        The Tigers and Gators play the second game of their three-game
series tomorrow, beginning at 6 pm CT, at Perry Field in McKethan
Stadium. Airtime on the Auburn Network set for 5:45 pm. You can listen to Auburn Baseball live in our <a href=../../../liveaudio/main_liveaudio.html>Live Audio</a> section.
