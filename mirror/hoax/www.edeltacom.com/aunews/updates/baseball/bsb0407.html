<p><b>OXFORD, Miss.</b>-  Ole Miss pitcher Jeff McAvoy held Auburn to a conference-low three runs as the Rebels defeated the 10th-ranked Tigers, 8-3, tonight at Swayze Field. Ole Miss improved to 20-13 overall and a 6-6 mark in the Southeastern Conference, while Auburn fell to 29-9 and 7-6 in SEC play.
<p>Auburn took a 1-0 lead in the third inning when Dominic Rich hit a lead off home run, his sixth of the seaon.
<p>Ole Miss took the lead for good in the sixth, scoring three runs on three hits. The big play in the inning came with two-outs as Auburn pitcher Levale Speigner threw away Lance Jones' chopper back to the plate into right field, scoring Carl Laferty from second and Jude Voltz from first.
<p>Following a Gabe Gross solo homer in the fifth, the Rebels scored two runs in the bottom of the inning, and one in the sixth with two outs.
<p>Auburn picked up its third solo home run of the evening when Mailon Kent hit his sixth home run of the season in the seventh. Ole Miss added two, tow-out insurance runs in the eighth for the final score.
<p>Freshman Levale Speigner (0-2) was credited with the loss after throwing a season high 5.2 innings, allowing seven hits and six runs. Ole Miss' Jeff McAvoy (6-2) earned the victory, allowing just three runs on 11 Auburn hits over 6.1 innings. McAvoy also struck out nine Tiger batters.
