<p><b>AUBURN</b>- Auburn scored seven runs in the last three innings to come away with a 9-5 win over Mississippi State in coach Hal Baird's final regular-season game at Plainsman Park.   Auburn improved to 40-16 and 17-13 in the SEC, finishing third in the Western Division.  MSU dropped to 38-15 and 17-10 in the league.
<P>     Baird, who will retire at the conclusion of the 2000 season after 16 years at Auburn, was recognized in a pre-game ceremony.  Auburn received a strong pitching performance from Hayden Gliemmo and the Tiger offense collected 12 hits, including a home run by Todd Faulkner, his 22nd of the season, which set a school record.
<P>     Gliemmo (4-1) picked up the win after allowing just five hits and one run while striking out a season-high seven batters in 6.0 innings of work.  Freshman Brent Speigner earned his first career save after pitching three innings and giving up two runs and three hits.
<P>     Auburn grabbed a 2-0 lead in the third inning on three consecutive hits.  Gabe Gross led off the inning with a double and was followed by a RBI double from Todd Faulkner.  Faulkner scored on Brett Burnham's single to centerfield.
<P>     The Tigers scored four runs in the sixth to take a 6-0 advantage on three consecutive walks followed by three straight singles.  Auburn's seven through nine batters each walked setting up singles from Dominic Rich, Mailon Kent and Gabe Gross.
<P>     Mississippi State cut the Auburn lead to 6-4 in the with three in the seventh and one in the eighth.  The Bulldogs' Jon Knott led off the seventh with a solo home run to leftfield off Gliemmo.  Following a pitching change, Tiger reliever Kevin Knorst walked Ty Martin and gave up a double to Jamie Rock.  Martin scored on a fielding error by Dominic Rich and Rock scored on a wild pitch by Brent Speigner. MSU added a run in the eighth courtesy of a RBI single from Rock.
<P>     Auburn answered with three runs in the eighth.  Gross drove in Mailon Kent with a single and Faulkner followed with a two-run home run off the scoreboard.  The homer, his 22nd, broke the single season record of 21 held by Frank Thomas in 1987 and Josh Etheredge in 1998.
<P>     The Bulldogs scored one more run in the ninth when lead-off hitter Matthew Maniscalco belted a home run over the right center field wall.   MSU pitcher Jeff Hunter (6-2) was charged with the loss after giving up two runs and six hits and striking out two in 4.1 innings of work.
<P>     Auburn will travel to Hoover, Ala., this coming week for the Southeastern Conference Tournament, May 17-21, at Hoover Metropolitan Stadium.  The Tigers will play on Wednesday, May 17 at 5 pm against fourth-seeded Florida. Airtime on the Auburn Network set for 4:45 pm.
