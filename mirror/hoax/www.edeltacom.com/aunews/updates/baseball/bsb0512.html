<p><b>AUBURN</b>- Auburn freshman Levale Speigner threw a career-best
eight innings, allowing four hits and two earned runs and won his first
career SEC game as the 14th-ranked Tigers defeated seventh-ranked
Mississippi State, 6-3, tonight.  The Tigers improved to 39-15 overall
and 16-12 in the Southeastern Conference, while the Bulldogs dropped to
37-14 and 16-9 in the SEC.
<p>
        Speigner (2-2) retired the first 11 batters he faced before
allowing four consecutive hits and three Bulldog runs with two outs in
the fourth inning.  Mississippi State's Jamie Rock's single scored Jon
Knott and Ty Martin, giving the Bulldogs a 3-2 lead.
   <p>             
        Auburn tied the game in the fifth when Hayden Gliemmo's two-out
single scored Gabe Gross from third base.  Glimmo knocked in the winning
run in the seventh on a sacrifice fly to centerfield scoring Todd
Faulkner from third. Faulkner doubled to lead off the inning, for his
25th double of the season, tying a school record held by Tony Haney.
<p>
        Speigner retired the last 13 batters he faced following the
Bulldog's three-run fourth.  Auburn added two runs insurance runs in the
eighth inning and Colter Bean recorded the final three outs for his
fifth save of the season.
<p>
        Auburn grabbed a 2-0 lead in the second inning after scoring a
run in the first and second innings.  The Tigers scored in the first
when Mailon Kent scored from third base on Todd Faulkner's single to
center field.  John Tyler gave Auburn a two-run advantage when he hit
his first home run of the season, over the left-center field fence.
<p>
        Chris Young (4-1) was credited with the loss for the Bulldogs,
allowing three runs on five hits in two innings of relief.
<p>
        The second game of the three-game series will begin tomorrow at
3:15 pm CT at Plainsman Park.  The game will be televised live by Fox
Sports Net South. Airtime on the Auburn Network set for 3:00 pm. You can listen to Auburn Baseball live in our <a href=../../../liveaudio/main_liveaudio.html>Live Audio</a> section.
