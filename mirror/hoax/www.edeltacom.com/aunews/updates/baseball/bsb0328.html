<p><b>MONTGOMERY, AL</b>-  Todd Faulkner's three-run home run in the top of the eighth inning led sixth-ranked Auburn to an 11-8 victory over Troy State, here tonight. The win was Auburn's eighth in a row, and improved the Tigers record to 27-6 on the season.  Troy State fell to 13-18 overall.
<P>Trailing 8-7 entering the eighth, second baseman Dominic Rich started the rally with a two-out single. After stealing second base, Rich advanced to third on a wild pitch by the Trojan's Mickey O'Quinn.  Rich tied the game on a past ball by catcher Brandon Davis.  Auburn's John Tyler had struck out on the play and advanced to first on the past ball, keeping the inning alive.  Gabe Gross then walked, setting up Faulkner's 14th home run of the season.
<P>Auburn jumped to a 7-3 lead early in the contest, behind three runs in the first and third, and a single run in the fourth on Rich's fifth home run of the season to left-center field.
<P>Tiger reliever Kyle Hudlow had his best outing of the season while picking up the victory.  Hudlow (2-0) threw 3.2 innings of hitless ball, while walking one and striking out a career-high six batters.  Auburn starter Kevin Knorst went 5.1 innings, striking out a career-high eight batters, allowing six runs on six hits.
<P>Faulkner led Auburn offensive attack, going 4-for-5 with two runs, two doubles and four RBI. Rich added three hits, two stolen bases, and three runs, while Gross and Chris Beaird added two hits apiece.
<P>O'Quinn (2-1) was credited with the loss for Troy State.  O'Quinn allowed two hits and two unearned runs in 1.2 innings of work.  Colin Holder had two hits for the Trojans, while Davis and Marek Driver added two RBI.
<p>Auburn plays host to the LSU Tigers for a three-game series this weekend. Friday's first pitch is set for 7:30 pm with airtime on the Auburn Network set for 7:15 pm.
