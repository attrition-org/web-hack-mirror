<p><b>April 8, 2000</b></p>


<p><b>OXFORD, Miss.</b>-  Auburn scored two runs in the first inning and
five in the second inning en route to a 16-8 win over Ole Miss today at
Swayze Field. Todd Faulkner and Gabe Gross each homered for the Tigers,
and pitcher Chris Bootcheck went seven innings for the victory.  The
Tigers improved to 30-9 overall and 8-6 in SEC play, while Ole Miss fell
to 20-14 and 6-7 in conference play.
<p>
        Auburn set the tone in the first inning as Gross singled with
two outs and was followed by Faulkner, who hit his 15th home run of the
season to right field.  
<p>
        Dominic Rich singled with the bases loaded in the second,
scoring Heath Higgins and John Tyler, giving Auburn a 4-0 advantage. 
The Tigers scored two more runs on bases loaded walks by Gross and
Faulkner. Brett Burnham's sacrifice fly scored Mailon Kent to conclude
the second inning scoring for Auburn.
<p>
        The Tigers added three runs in the fifth and sixth innings, as
Gross hit his 10th home run of the season down the right field line in
the sixth, taking a 16-3 lead.
<p>
        Ole Miss added five runs in the ninth off Auburn relievers Sean
Jones and Jacob Sumners.
<p>
        Bootcheck won his fourth consecutive game in the conference and
improved to 8-0 overall.  Bootcheck allowed five hits and three runs,
while striking out five in seven innings.  Ole Miss starter Brett Young
(2-1) was credited with the loss.  Young allowed six hits, seven runs,
including five earned runs in 1.1 innings of work.

        Gross finished the day with his second consecutive four-hit
performance.  Through two games in the series, Gross is 8-for-11 in the
series with two home runs, two doubles, and four runs.  Faulkner also
had four hits on the day, with a season-high six RBI, and three runs.

        The 30th win by Auburn marked the 16th consecutive time that the
Tigers have won 30 or more games in a season.  Auburn's 16 runs on the
day was the 21st time this season in 39 games the Tiger offense has
