<P><B>August 20, 2000</B></P>


<P><B>AUBURN</B>-  The Tigers returned to the practice field Sunday
afternoon for a two-hour
workout in full gear after taking Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning
off. Head coach
Tommy Tuberville was pleased with the Tigers' effort, but noted some
rustiness on offense after
the time off.

<P>     "We looked kind of sluggish after the day off," Tuberville said.
"The offense looked like
they were running in slow motion. We've got a lot of guys that have to
make a tremendous
amount of improvement in a week's time. But, we'll get there."

    <P> Tuberville cited the play of the defense after the practice, which
concentrated mostly on
team work.
     
<P>     "Defensively, we're playing a lot better than I would have thought
at this point,"
Tuberville said. "We're playing some young guys and they have made some
plays. We've got a
lot of team work to get done in the next few days and we'll keep going
against each other. We're
not going to go against the scout team until we get a little bit
better. Overall, the effort was good,
the concentration just wasn't there today."

    <P> The Tigers will have a brief walk-thru at 9:30 a.m. and practice
at 4:45 p.m. Monday
before taking Tuesday off for the first day of classes. 

<P>     All Auburn football practices will be held behind the Auburn
Athletic Complex and are
open to the public.
