<!--STORY-->
<tr><td>
<P><B>August 15, 1999</B></P>


<P><B>AUBURN</B>-  Auburn went through a pair of two-hour practice sessions
in shells on the intramural fields Tuesday.  The afternoon workout was
spent concentrating on position drills for the first half of practice,
while spending the remainder of the afternoon working on team drills.

      <P>  Head Coach Tommy Tuberville indicated after a lapse of
concentration during Monday's workouts, that the team had a better focus
during Tuesday's drills.

<P>        "We had a good day of practice,"  Tuberville said.  "We lost a
little bit of concentration yesterday, but I thought we got it back
today.  We are getting good senior leadership.  I'm really pleased with
the running backs and how they are holding onto the ball and learning
their assignments.  They were struggling for a while, but those guys
have really improved."  

    <P>    The Tigers received good news on Tuesday regarding senior
linebacker Alex Lincoln.  A Mobile native, Lincoln injured his left knee
during Monday morning's practice. Lincoln was evaluated Tuesday morning
by Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham.  It was determined that Lincoln had
sprained his left knee capsule.

   <P>     "Alex Lincoln was not operated on and the doctors said that he
should be ready to go in two or three days.  That's great news in that
area,"  Tuberville said.

       <P> Auburn also saw the first action from junior college transfer
Ronaldo Attimy.  A junior cornerback from Spring Valley, NY, and
Northeastern Oklahoma A&M, Attimy arrived in Auburn Tuesday morning and
practiced for the first time in the afternoon.
 
       <P> The Tigers will hold practice tomorrow at 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. on
the intramural fields. All practice sessions until August 20 will be
held on the intramural fields and are open to the public.

      <P>  Auburn hosts Fan Day Saturday from 1-3 p.m. at Beard-Eaves
Memorial Coliseum.  Admission is free.
