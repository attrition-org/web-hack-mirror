<P><B>August 21, 2000</B></P>


<P><B>AUBURN</B>- Auburn went through two workouts on Monday with a
walk-through session in shirts and shorts during the morning and a
two-hour practice in full pads in the afternoon on the practice fields. 
Monday's afternoon practice was spent working on individual work and
special teams during the beginning portion, with the end of practice
dedicated to team drills. 

     <P>   Head Coach Tommy Tuberville was happy by the squads' work during
Monday's two sessions.

      <P>  "This was probably one of our better practices,"  Tuberville
said.  "Our concentration was better and the weather was cool.  We did a
lot of team work, adding our nickel defenses and short yardage defenses.
 We worked a lot on play action with both our offense and defense.   We
are still doing a lot of individual drills getting a last look at guys
before we make the cut on who's got an opportunity to play this first
week."

     <P>   Tuberville talked about Tuesday's day off and the upcoming
preparation for Auburn's season opener with Wyoming on Aug. 31, in
Jordan-Hare Stadium.  

      <P>  "We are going to give the players 48 hours off to try to get
some guys who are hurt healthy,"  Tuberville said.  "We've got a lot of
work to do.  We will start game planning with scout teams (Wednesday). 
We will also cut back on the contact to get everyone healthy and get the
game plan down and get ready to go."

    <P>    In other news Tuesday, defensive tackle Roderick Chambers had
his left knee scoped by Dr. Lawrence Lemak in Birmingham.  It was
determined that Chambers had a torn medial meniscus.  A senior from
Eufaula, Chambers injured his knee during Sunday afternoon's practice.

   <P>     After taking Tuesday off, the Tigers will return to practice on
Wednesday at 3:30 p.m. on the practice fields.  The fall semester at
Auburn University will begin with classes tomorrow.
