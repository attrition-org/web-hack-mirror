Ole Miss defeated Auburn 24-17 in overtime last year for its first win since 1992 ... This is the 11th consecutive year that the two schools have faced each other ... All 11 of those meetings have come in the month of September ... Four of the last 11 games have been decided by 10 points or less ... The largest margin of victory in the series is 41 points when the Tigers defeated the Rebels, 41-0, in 1985 ... Auburn is 20-7-1 all-time in the state of Mississippi ... The Rebels have been shutout by the Tigers three times since 1970 ... Rob Pate picked off his first career pass in the 1998 Ole Miss game in Oxford ...

<h3>Mississippi Tigers</h3>
<P>    Five players on the Auburn roster call the state of Mississippi home.  They include senior OT Kendall Simmons (Ripley), junior OT Jeremy Toungett (Olive Branch), sophomore TE Lorenzo Diamond, redshirt freshman QB Allen Tillman (Newton), and freshman QB Jason Campbell (Taylorsville).
<h3>New Faces</h3>
<P>    A total of 62 players saw action in the Tigers’ season opening victory over Wyoming, including 26 first-timers.  Of those players that played in their first game at Auburn, there were five junior college transfers, one sophomore, 11 redshirt freshmen, and nine true freshmen.
<P>    Seven of those 26 had their first start in an Auburn uniform, including six on defense.  Starting in their first college game included:  Rudi Johnson (TB), Whit Smith (LE), DeMarco McNeil (LT), Josh Weldon (RT), Reggie Torbor (RE), Mark Brown (LB), and Rashaud Walker (ROV).
<P>    Thirty-two of the 62 that played against the Cowboys were underclassmen.
<h3>Rudi Steps on the Scene</h3>
<P>    Junior college transfer Rudi Johnson made a big splash in his first game at Auburn, rushing for 174 yards on 27 carries with three touchdowns against Wyoming.  His 174-yard performance was the most yards ever by an Auburn player in his Auburn debut.  It also ranked as the 28th most yards all-time in a single-game.
   <P> His 174 yards were the most by an Auburn player since Stephen Davis ran for 186 yards (32 carries) against Georgia in 1994.  Johnson gained more rushing yards (174) against Wyoming than the Tigers had gained as a team in each of the last 18 games dating back to the 1998 Tennessee game when Auburn rushed for 181 yards.
   <P> Johnson became the first Auburn runningback to rush for 100 yards since 1998 when Demontray Carter rushed for 102 yards against Alabama.
   <P> His three TD’s also marked the first time an Auburn runningback scored three touchdowns in a game since Stephen Davis had four against UTC in 1995.  Johnson’s 70-yard fourth quarter touchdown run is tied for the 27th longest run in school history.
   <P> Johnson is the 22nd player in school history to rush for 150 or more yards in a game.  Bo Jackson and James Brooks each ran for 150+ yards in a game eight times during their college careers.
   <P> For his efforts, the Auburn coaching staff named Johnson the offensive player of the game.
<h3>Leard Spreads the Wealth</h3>
<P>    QB Ben Leard spread the wealth against Wyoming, completing passes to eight differant receivers.
<P>    Freshmen WR Jeris McIntyre and TE Robert Johnson each caught their first career passes.  Johnson’s catch of 15 yards in the first quarter was also his first career touchdown.
<P>    Since the arrival of offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone, Auburn has completed passes to seven or more players in seven of 12 games.
<h3>The Run Stops Here</h3>
<P>    Auburn held Wyoming to just 29 yards rushing in 26 attempts in last Thursday’s opener.  Since Tommy Tuberville has been at Auburn, seven of the Tigers’ 12 opponents have been held under 100 yards rushing.  Four of those teams have been held under 50 yards rushing.
