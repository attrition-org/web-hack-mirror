<p><b>AUBURN</b>- Auburn spent two and a half hours working in shells on
Wednesday in preparation for Saturday's game versus LSU in Jordan-Hare
Stadium.  The 24th-ranked Tigers labored through hot conditions, working
on special teams, individual drills, and implementing more of the game
plan for LSU. 

    <p>    Head Coach Tommy Tuberville noted that Auburn still has more
progress to do prior to Saturday's game.

      <p>  "It wasn't a great practice.  It was hot and I thought we lost
our concentration early,  Tuberville said.  "We made some progress
putting our game plan in. Basically, we are trying to keep people
healthy.  We still have had some flu symptoms on a few guys the last
couple of days.  We are just trying to get everybody to know what's
going on and get everyone in the right spots."  

   <p>     Tuvberville stressed the importance of the Tigers' mental
preparation for their SEC home opener.

     <p>   "Hopefully we will get mentally ready because the toughest thing
for us to do is get over this small success we've had,  Tuberville said.
 "We need to understand that we still have a long way to go.  We still
have a lot of work to do."

    <p>    Auburn and LSU enter the game with a perfect 2-0 record, marking
the eighth time in the series that both teams have been undefeated. 
Most recently, the two schools were undefeated prior to the 1996, 1997,
and 1999 meetings.

      <p>  The game will also match up two of the top offensive teams in
the conference.  LSU is first in the SEC offensively averaging 488.5
yards per game, while the Tigers are tied for fourth in the conference
with 432.0 yards a contest.

      <p>  Kickoff Saturday between Auburn and LSU will be at 6:35 p.m. CT
in Jordan-Hare Stadium.  The game will be televised live nationally by
ESPN.
