<p><b>August 10, 2000</b></p>


<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  The entire Auburn team participated in their first workouts as the Tigers began
two-a-days with a pair of practices on the intramural fields Thursday.  Auburn went through a
two-hour practice in the morning session but had a shorter afternoon workout due to a lightning
delay.

    <P>    "We had a good morning practice," head coach Tommy Tuberville said.  "The weather didn't
cooperate in the afternoon practice.  We got some things done.  But, we didn't have an opportunity
to get anything done consistently this afternoon because we had to cut back all of our periods."

<P>        Tuberville said the focus during two-a-days will be learning which will include  shorter
practice sessions and more film work.

        <P> "I want to try to be off the field every night by 7 p.m., so we can have time to eat
dinner and watch film," Tuberville said.  "I really think that watching film with the young players
is going to enable us to get better a lot more quickly.  Doing things on the field just to do them,
is not going to help us.  We're going to spend more time in the film room and less time on the
field for the next 10 days."

    <P>    Overall, Tuberville was pleased with his team's attitude after the first day.  The Tigers
will practice twice on Friday and Saturday and once on Sunday.

<P>        "Overall, we have gotten off to a good start," Tuberville said.  "The enthusiasm has been
good and everybody is ready to go.  We just need to get a break with the weather."

      <P>  Auburn's first day in pads is slated for Saturday.  Practices until August 21 will be held
at the intramural fields and are open to the public.
