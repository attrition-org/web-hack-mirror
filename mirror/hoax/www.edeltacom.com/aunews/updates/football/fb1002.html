<p><b>KNOXVILLE, TN</b>-  Tennessee free safety Deon Grant intercepted three passes including one on the first play from scrimmage that went for a touchdown as the Volunteers defeated Auburn 24-0 in Neyland Stadium Saturday night.  Tennessee improved to 3-1 on the season and 1-1 in SEC play.  Auburn fell to 3-2 and 1-2 in the league.
<p>
	Auburn's offense never could get un-tracked thanks to the Tennessee defense, four turnovers and seven penalties for 69 yards.   Auburn's offense was held to 222 total yards, while Tennessee used a balanced attack with 181 rushing yards and 220 yards through the air.  The Volunteers dominated every offensive category including time of possession holding on to the football almost seven minutes longer than Auburn.
<p>
	After taking a 7-0 lead on Deon Grant's 19-yard interception return for a touchdown on the first play from scrimmage, both teams went scoreless until the :19 second mark of the first half.  Alex Walls gave the Vols a 10-0 lead on a 22-yard field goal.  Tennessee backup tailback Travis Henry scored the other two touchdowns on a 1-yard run midway through the third quarter and a 34-yard run late in the fourth.
<p>
	Auburn redshirt freshman quarterback Jeff Klein completed 15-of-29 for 147 yards and four interceptions.  The Tiger defense kept the pressure on Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin forcing three interceptions as Martin through for 220 yards completing 16-of-27.
<p>
	Tennessee tailbacks Travis Henry and Jamal Lewis ran 84 and 64 yards respectively.  Auburn was led by Clifton Robinson who rushed 65 yards on 20 carries.  
<p>
	The Vols' Cedrick Wilson led all receivers with six catches for 112 yards.  Ronney Daniels led the way for Auburn with four catches for 61 yards.  Reggie Worthy also caught the ball four times for 33 yards.  
<p>
	Auburn returns home next weekend to play Mississippi State.  The game is set for an 11:30 a.m. CT kick-off with airtime on the Auburn Network at 9:30 a.m. CT.
