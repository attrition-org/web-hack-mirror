<p><b>November 6, 1999</b></p>  


<p><b>AUBURN</B>-  Auburn scored 21 fourth quarter points in a span of two-and-a-half minutes including a 16-yard touchdown pass from Jeff Klein to Reggie Worthy to give them the lead for good in a 28-10 win over the University of Central Florida.  The win breaks a five game losing streak for the Tigers who improve to 4-5 on the season.  Central Florida falls to 3-6.

<P>Auburn scored on its opening drive moving 73 yards on nine plays capped off by a 20-yard touchdown pass from Klein to Travaris Robinson to give the Tigers a 7-0 lead.  Auburn would not score again until its flurry of points in the final period. 

<P>UCF tied the game with 8:10 remaining in the second quarter on an 83-yard touchdown pass from Vic Penn to Charles Lee.  Both Penn and Lee had big days for the Golden Knights.  Penn threw for 374 yards on 29-52 passing including one touchdown and two interceptions.  Lee had 11 grabs for 203 yards and a touchdown.  

	<P>In the second half UCF took the lead on a 39-yard field goal by Javier Beorlegui.  The Tigers had their chances to tie the game as Damon Duval missed on a 42-yard and a 39-yard field goal in the third and fourth quarters.

<P>Auburn's drive to give them the lead came after taking the ball on their own 30 with 10:39 left in the game.  The Tigers drove the ball over the next 6:38 with wide receiver Ronney Daniels leading Auburn with several clutch receptions.  On the day Daniels caught 10 passes for 143 yards.  

	<P>UCF failed to convert on fourth down on its next possession and turned the back over to Auburn on the Golden Knights eight-yard line.  It was from there that tailback Heath Evans took it in to give Auburn a 21-10 advantage.  The eight-yard run was part of another career day for the sophomore from West Palm Beach, Florida.  Evans ran the ball 24 times for 81 yards and a TD.

<P>The Tigers finished the scoring when Alex Lincoln intercepted a Vic Penn pass and ran it in from 20-yards out.  It was Lincoln's first career interception and gave Auburn the 28-10 margin of victory.  

	<P>Jeff Klein, subbing for the injured Ben Leard, completed 19-of-31 for 270 yards for two touchdowns and two interceptions.  Auburn racked up 368 yards of total offense compared to 347 for UCF.  The Tigers defense shut down the Golden Knights rushing attack holding UCF to minus-27 yards on the ground.  Auburn had 98 yards rushing in the game.  Auburn's defense also collected eight sacks for minus-53 yards.

<P>Auburn travels to Athens, Georgia next Saturday for the 103rd renewal of the Deep South's oldest rivalry.  Kickoff is set for 5 p.m. CT with airtime on the Auburn Network at 3 p.m. CT.
