<p><b>August 11, 2000</b></p>


<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  Auburn went through its second day of two-a-days with a pair of two-hour workouts
on the intramural fields Friday.  The Tigers spent the majority of the sessions working with their
position coaches with some of the practice dedicated to limited team work.

        <P>Head Coach Tommy Tuberville noted that although the team got in two uninterrupted
practices, the team lacked focus at times.

    <P>    "We had a decent day.  But, we lacked a lot of concentration," Tuberville said. "We had a
lot of enthusiasm and we're working hard.  The players are looking forward to getting into pads
tomorrow." 

<P>        Several players caught Tuberville's eye in the second day of practice including sophomore
kicker Damon Duval and freshman tight end Robert Johnson.

        <P>"I thought we got a lot of good work done with the kicking game today," Tuberville said.
"We spent about 45 minutes on it before practice and then had some kicking after practice.  Damon
Duval really kicked well.  Phillip Yost looked a little nervous today which is to be expected for a
freshman.  

    <P>    "Our receivers are catching the ball a lot better.  I am really pleased with Robert
Johnson's progress at tight end.  

<P>        "Defensively, the defensive line has made more improvement than we would have expected by
this time.  They're learning a lot right now.  They're working hard and putting a lot into it."

       <P> Auburn will practice in full gear for the first time during Saturday's morning session
which begins at 7 a.m.  The Tigers will also work out at 5 p.m. on the intramural fields.

   <P>     Auburn's practices on the intramural fields are open to the public.
