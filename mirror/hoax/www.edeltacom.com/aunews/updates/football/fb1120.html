<!--STORY-->
<tr><td>
<p><b>November 20, 1999</b></p>


<p><b>AUBURN</B>- <p>
<UL><LI>Ronney Daniels' 21-yard reception in the first quarter put him over 1,000 receiving yards on the season.  Daniels is the second Auburn receiver to accomplish the feat.  Terry Beasley had 1,051 yards in 1970.
<LI>Ben Leard had a 170.78 passing efficiency in the 1999 season, the best mark of any Tiger quarterback in school history.
<LI>Redshirt freshman tight end Lorenzo Diamond's seven-yard touchdown reception in the second quarter is the first of his career.
<LI>Ronney Daniels' six-yard reception at the 6:53 mark of the second quarter, established him as Auburn's all-time single-season receiving yards leader.  Daniels broke the 29-year-old record of 1,050 yards set by Terry Beasley in 1970.  He finished the season with 1,068 yards receiving.
<LI>Senior Markeith Cooper's 15-yard TD reception in the second quarter was his third receiving touchdown of the season and his second in the last two games.
<LI>Larry Casher's second quarter interception was his fifth of the season and first since the Florida game.  As a team, it was Auburn's first interception since the Central Florida game.
<LI>Marcus Washington's second quarter sack was his team-leading seventh of the season.
<LI>With two touchdown passes, quarterback Ben Leard is just the third Tiger quarterback in school history to throw for two TD's in the Auburn-Alabama game.  Loran Carter (1968) and Patrick Nix (1995) each threw for a pair of touchdowns.
<LI>Ronney Daniels' 56 catches on the season is second-best on Auburn's single-season receptions list, moving just ahead of Terry Beasley's 55 in 1971.  Willie Gosha (1995) and Frank Sanders (1994) share the single-season record with 58 each.
<LI>With 158 pass attempts without an interception (including two attempts in 1998), Ben Leard is fourth on the SEC all-time list for pass attempts without an interception.  The record of 200 was set by Ole Miss' Stewart Patridge in 1997.  Leard went the whole season without throwing an interception until his final pass attempt.
<LI>Heath Evans set a career-high with 83 rushing yards vs. Alabama.
<LI>Ben Leard completed 26 passes against Alabama, the most ever by a Tiger quarterback against the Crimson Tide.
<LI>It is the first time since the 1980 and 1981 seasons that Auburn has had back-to-back losing seasons.  In Pat Dye's first season at Auburn in 1981, the Crimson Tide defeated the Tigers 28-17…the same score as tonight's game in Tommy Tuberville's first Alabama game as the Tigers' head coach.

<h3>QUOTING AUBURN HEAD COACH TOMMY TUBERVILLE --- THE ALABAMA GAME</h3>
<P>"We didn’t play very well the second half obviously.  The difference in that football game was one guy, Shaun Alexander.  It was a one man show.  We couldn’t tackle him.  We couldn’t make any plays and couldn’t get the ball back.  I am proud of our players.  They didn’t quit.  We struggled in the kicking game.  It lost us games all year long.  It is frustrating to get in a game like this and know you have a chance and not get what you need to do out of the kicking game.  Next year, we are going to have a kicker.  I am proud of our team.  Both teams came to play, but we came up short."
<P><B>(On the play Alabama recorded a safety)</B><BR>        "We were going to run a play action with maximum protection, but somebody didn’t get the block.  A guy made a mistake and we didn’t make a play."
<P><B>(On the Auburn special teams play)</B><BR>        "We missed the field goal and we went from getting three points to no points.  I thought he would make it, but it didn’t happen."
<P><B>        (On the onside kick)</B><BR>        We were just trying to win the game.  We almost got the ball.  Who knows?  You have to take the three points and get out of the eight point range and give you a chance to win."
<P><B>        (On the Alabama defense)</B><BR>        "We were making plays.  Their defensive front kept coming and our offensive line got tired in the fourth.  When we got behind, we had to try to get the ball down the field further.
<P><B>        (On the Auburn-Alabama game) </B><BR>        "It is fun for the players, fun for the fans and fun for the coaches.  We just got beat by #37.
<P><B>        (On Tyler Watts)</B><BR>        "Where has he been all year?  Looks like the team works better with him out there.  It is good to have two quarterbacks."
<P><B>        (On Alabama in the second half)</B><BR>        "Defensively, they came out and started to run the football.  Instead of trying to throw it, they began to run the ball and get it to #37.  We gave our guys an opportunity to win the game.  It just didn’t work out."
<h3>QUOTING AUBURN PLAYERS --- THE ALABAMA GAME</h3>
<h4>Ben Leard, QB</h4>
<P>"I feel like I let down a lot of people, especially the seniors and the fans.  Crucial mistakes lost the ballgame.  We couldn’t get out of holes.  There were a lot of mistakes on my part."
<P><B>       (On the safety) </B><BR>        "It was a play action pass.  I couldn’t really see.  I didn’t want to throw it in the air.  I just decided to give away two points instead of more.  I just didn’t think."
<P><B>        (On the missed Auburn field goal) </B><BR>        "I figured we could make the field goal.  We would have been up 17-6.  That is the way this game is...whoever makes the fewer mistakes.  There was a lot of opportunities that we missed.  You can’t put all of the blame on Damon (Duval).  If anything, put the blame on me for giving up the safety."
<P><B>        (On Alabama)</B><BR>        "They got the momentum.  They started blitzing a little more.  They just started playing well and executing on defense.  They played great foootball in the fourth quarter.  They kept Ronney (Daniels) from making big plays, but someone else should have stepped up and made big plays."
<P><B>        (On the momentum switch)</B><BR>        "After the touchdown when they scored after the safety, you could feel the momentum switch.  We got the ball back and went three and out.  We just couldn’t bounce back from it."
<P><B>        (On your feelings)</B><BR>        "It is frustrating, disappointing.  This year has been something...I feel like I have let a lot of people down by being hurt so much and being out of games a lot.  At the same time, if I hadn’t gone through the tough times last year, I wouldn’t have been able to do what I did this year.  This team went through twice as much.  We lost five games in a row...almost lost to Idaho.  This team has a lot of character.  The seniors have led us and they have showed us that we have potential to have a great future.  They let us see the light at the end of the tunnel. You can’t say enough about their leadership."
<h4>Marcus Washington, DL</h4>
<P><B>        (On Shaun Alexander)</B><BR>        "He is a great running back and is probably the best back we have faced all year.  We were trying to get as many guys to tackle him as possible.  He was able to find some holes.  Their offensive line blocked well for him."
<P><B>        (On Tyler Watts)</B><BR>        "He was a big momentum boost for them.  He came in and played real well tonight.  He came in and gave them a lot of momentum.  Once they got the momentum, it was easy to stay up.  The crowd got into it."
<P><B>        (On walking off the field for the last time)</B><BR>        "It hurts a lot.  We really...this is the first time Alabama has ever won down here.  It will probably stay with us the rest of our life."
<h4>Heath Evans, RB</h4>
<P>"They had our number in certain areas tonight.  The safety hurt us.  We had come out and pounded the ball down their throats all night and there was no excuse that we couldn’t do it again.  The game is about execution, and they made less mistakes than we did and that was the difference."
<h4>Jimmy Brumbaugh, DT</h4>
<P>"We came out in the first half and played hard, but we weren’t able to finish the game.  The game turned because we couldn’t stop them when we had to."

<h3>ALABAMA POST-GAME NOTES<BR>The Auburn Game (November 20, 1999</h3>
<UL><LI>Alabama's 28-17 win over Auburn is the Crimson Tide's first-ever win at Jordan-Hare Stadium.  The Crimson Tide was 0-4 at Auburn prior to tonight's game, losing in 1989 (30-20), 1993 (22-15), 1995 (31-17) and 1997 (18-17).
<LI>The Crimson Tide has won two straight games over Auburn for the first time since winning three in-a-row from 1990-92.  In addition, Alabama has won seven of the last 10 games against Auburn during the decade of the 1990s.
<LI>This is the first win by the visiting team since Alabama's 13-6 over the Tigers at Legion Field in 1991.  Auburn was the designated home team in that game.  It was the Tigers final ever game at Birmingham's historic stadium.
<LI>Alabama's 28-17 win over Auburn is the same score the Tide beat the Tigers in 1981 to give Coach Paul "Bear" Bryant his 315th career coaching win on Nov. 28, 1981.  The win moved Bryant past Amos Alonzo Stagg as college football's all-time winningest coach.
<LI>Alabama has scored 58 points in its last two wins over Auburn giving the Tide the most points in back-to-back wins over Auburn since 1980-81.  Bama beat Auburn 34-18 in 1980 and 28-17 in 1981 as the Tide combined for 62 points in back-to-back wins over the Tigers.
<LI>Alabama's win over Auburn clinches the Crimson Tide's fifth Southeastern Conference Western Division championship since the inception of divisional plays in 1992.  Alabama has won SEC Western Division titles in 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996 and 1999.  Alabama will meet Florida for the 1999 SEC Championship on Saturday, Dec. 4 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.  This will be the fifth meeting between Alabama and Florida in SEC Championship game play.  In addition, the 1999 SEC Championship game makes the first time the two participants will meet in a rematch.  Alabama defeated Florida 40-39 in overtime in Gainesville on Oct. 2, 1999.  Shaun Alexander scored four TDs in the win over the Gators, including a 25-yard run in overtime for the game-winner.
<LI>Shaun Alexander's five-yard touchdown run with 7:02 left in the game makes him the all-time rushing leading in Alabama history.  Alexander moved past Bobby Humphrey (1985-88), who ran for 3,420 yards for the Crimson Tide.
<LI>In addition, the five-yard touchdown run is Alexander's 22nd TD of the season setting the single-season SEC record.  He broke the old record of 21 TDs set by Georgia's Garrison Hearst in 1992.  Alexander tied Hearst's mark with a four-yard touchdown run with 11:55 left in the game was his 21st touchdown of the 1999 season.  Alexander is one of only four SEC players with 20+ TDs in one season.
<LI>In addition, Alexander ran the ball 33 times for 182 yards, giving him his fifth career 100-yard rushing game.  Alexander is now tied with Bobby Humphrey (1995-88) for most career 100-yard games at Alabama. He added three receptions for one yard.
<LI>With one game to play in the regular season, Alexander has 697 career rushing attempts for 3,368 yards and 40 touchdowns for the Crimson Tide.
<LI>Sophomore receiver Freddie Milons became the Crimson Tide's single-season reception leader with his 62nd catch of the season.  Milons 12-yard reception in the second quarter broke the previous record of 63 receptions by David Palmer in 1993.  Palmer caught 63 passes for a school-record 1,000 yards. At the conclusion of tonight's game, Milons has 66 catches for 734 yards.  Milons is just the eighth player in school history with 700 receiving yards in a season.
<LI>Milons had six catches for 54 yards against Auburn, with four receptions going for 10 or more yards.  He added two punt returns for 27yards and one kickoff return for 30 yards, giving him 111 all-purpose yards against the Tigers.
<LI>Alabama defensive end Kindal Moorehead recorded his second career safety when he sacked Auburn's Ben Leard in the end zone with 54 seconds left in the third quarter.  Moorehead's safety came after Alabama failed on a fourth-down conversion at the Tigers two-yard line.  The safety cut the lead to 14-8.
<LI>The safety was the first by Alabama since recording two safeties in a win over Vanderbilt last year at Legion Field.  Moorehead sacked Vandy QB Greg Zolman for one safety and Zolman was called for intentional grounding in the end zone, resulting in the second safety.
<LI>Reggie Myles recorded his fifth interception of the season with 45 seconds left in the game to seal Alabama's 28-17 win over the Tigers.  Myles leads the Alabama team with five interceptions this season.
<LI>Myles interception was the Crimson Tide's 10th interception in the last four games.

<h3>QUOTING ALABAMA HEAD COACH MIKE DUBOSE</h3>
<P><B>ON BEATING AUBURN</B><BR>"It was a tremendous win.  This football team has come so far.  I am so unbelievably happy for them.  I really don't know how to express it in words."
<P><B>ON AUBURN'S GAME PLAN</B><BR>"I think Tommy Tuberville had as good a game plan as we have seen all year.  They really gave us some problems with some of the things they did offensively.  I didn't think we were flat in the first half.  I felt like Auburn did such a good job with their game plan offensively and defensively that they had us scratching our heads at times.  We were lucky we didn't go into halftime down more than we were."
<P><B>ON WINNING THE SEC WEST</B><BR>"We have accomplished some of our goals, but we haven't accomplished all of them.  We put ourselves in a position to go to Atlanta, and now we have a challenge in a great Florida team."
<P><B>ON THE HEISMAN RACE</B><BR>"I don't know what the Heisman race is, but there can't be a better football player in this country than Shaun Alexander."
<h3>QUOTING ALABAMA PLAYERS</h3>
<h4>GERALD DIXON---CORNER BACK</h4>
<P>"We came in knowing we could win this ball game.  I think we just started out a little sluggish.  It seemed to me that we were beating ourselves in the first half.  At halftime we talked about staying focused in the second half and everyone doing their jobs.
<P>"Auburn has a great team.  This was a big win for us.  It helped us achieve one of our goals of winning the SEC West."
<h4>CHRIS SAMUELS---OFFENSIVE TACKLE</h4>
<P>"I am so proud of this team.  This win was special for me because it was my last game against Auburn, and beating them on the Plains is just awesome.  In the second half we were able to control the line of scrimmage.  At halftime coach told us that we were getting beat off of the ball, and that just inspired us.  Our offensive line really took control in the second half.
<P>"Tyler came in and did a good job, but mostly we were just running the ball.  We dominated their defensive line and we knew that is what we needed to do in the second half to win the game."
<h4>TYLER WATTS---QUARTERBACK</h4>
<P>"Coach told me at halftime that he had decided to put me in.  It was sudden excitement and fear all in one.  It was great to get the opportunity to play.  They told me just to stay with my reads and let the guys around me make the plays.  It takes a lot of pressure off of me being able to give the ball to Shaun.  It was just a tremendous experience.  It is something ever kid dreams of and I am just happy I got the opportunity."
