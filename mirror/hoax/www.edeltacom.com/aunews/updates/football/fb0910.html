<p><b>September 10, 2000</b></p>


<p><B>AUBURN</B>-  The Tigers returned to the practice field Sunday, a day after notching their first Southeastern
Conference victory of the season with a 35-27 win over Ole Miss Saturday night in Oxford. 
<p>
        Auburn practiced for an hour and a half behind the Athletic Complex, working on team drills and conditioning.
Offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone said the Tigers spent the practice working on mental preparation for Saturday's upcoming
game against LSU.
<p>
        "We worked on some of the mistakes from last night's game and tried to get some of the soreness out," Mazzone said.
"We wanted to get our minds off of Ole Miss and focused on LSU. We want to enjoy that win, but it's time to get ready for
next week's game."
<p>
        Mazzone also noted the offensive line's play as the Tigers tallied 261 yards rushing against the Rebels. 
<p>
        "I think they are really coming together. The thing that I saw last night that really impressed me was that we had
the same energy and enthusiasm in the fourth quarter that we did in the first quarter," Mazzone said. "They are really
starting to have a lot of confidence in themselves and what we are trying to accomplish."
<p>
        The Tigers will enter next Saturday's match-up ranked 24th in the nation in both the Associated Press and USA
Today/Coaches' Poll. It is the first time since the opening game of the 1998 season Auburn has been ranked in the top 25.
<p>
        Auburn and LSU will kickoff at 6:30 p.m. CT Saturday in a game nationally televised by ESPN.
