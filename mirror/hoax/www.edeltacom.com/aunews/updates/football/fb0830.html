<P><B>August 31, 2000</B></P>


<P><B>AUBURN</B>-  The Auburn Tigers open the 2000 football season Thursday against the Wyoming Cowboys.  Airtime on the Auburn Network is 5:00 pm.  

<P><h3> 85,612</font></h3>
        <P> Jordan-Hare Stadium’s
          new capacity this year is 85,612 after seating 85,214 since renovations
          to the stadium in 1987. </font>
        <P> The increase comes
          during off-season construction of new home and visitors’ locker rooms
          and a tunnel in the middle of the south end zone. While seats were removed
          with the addition of the tunnel in the south end zone, seats were added
          near the old tunnel in the southwest corner and an additional row of
          seat were added to the top of the north end zone. </font>
        <P> With a capacity
          of 85,612, Jordan-Hare Stadium now becomes the sixth largest on-campus
          facility, surpassing Stanford’s 85,500-seat Stanford Stadium in Palo
          Alto, Calif. </font>
        <h3> New Locker Rooms</font></h3>
        <P>  During the off-season,
          new home and visitors’ locker rooms were constructed in Jordan-Hare
          Stadium. </font>
        <P> At a cost of $1.5
          million, Auburn’s locker room increased in size from 1,300 square feet
          to 3,223 square feet. The new facility, also includes a media room,
          photographers dark room, training room and equipment room. </font>
        <P> The signature piece
          to the locker room is an AU logo centered in the carpet with a large
          AU logo hanging directly overhead. </font>
        <P> A visible change
          to fans will be the addition of a tunnel centered in the south end zone.
          Instead of entering and exiting the stadium from the southwest corner
          of Jordan-Hare Stadium as was done in years past, the Tigers will now
          use the new entrance to enter and leave the stadium. </font>
        <P> Currently under
          construction, the second phase of the locker room project will include
          a recruiting lounge and a coaches locker room. </font>
        <P> The previous locker
          room facilities were originally built in 1963, then renovated in 1970.
          </font>
        <P> Visiting teams will
          also have a new locker room facility this season. Previously housed
          in the south end zone, the visiting locker rooms are now in the north
          end zone, complete with a coaches’ locker room, training room and media
          room. Opposing teams will now enter the field from the northeast corner
          of Jordan-Hare Stadium. </font>
        <h3> Auburn in Openers</font></h3>
        <P>  Auburn has an 83-22-2
          record in season-opening games. Auburn has won 12 of its last 14 season
          openers. The Tigers defeated Appalachian State, 22-15, in last season's
          opener. </font>
        <P>  Auburn has won
          14 of the last 15 season openers played in Jordan-Hare Stadium dating
          back to 1976. Overall, the Tigers are 40-4-1 when kicking off the season
          at home. </font>
        <h3> Tuberville in Openers</font></h3>
        <P>  Tommy Tuberville
          is 4-1 in season openers, including a 1-0 mark in openers at Auburn.
          In his first game as head coach at Auburn last season, Tuberville's
          team defeated Appalachian State, 22-15, at Jordan-Hare Stadium. In fact,
          Tuberville has won four consecutive season openers dating back to 1996,
          including three at Ole Miss and one at Auburn. </font>
        <h3> Non-Conference
          Action</font></h3>
        <P>  Auburn has won
          25 of the last 26 regular-season non-conference games dating back to
          1991. Auburn has won five consecutive non-conference games dating back
          to the 1998 season. All five of those wins came in the confines of Jordan-Hare
          Stadium. In 1999, the Tigers were 3-0 against non-SEC teams, with wins
          over Appalachian State, Idaho, and Central Florida. </font>
        <h3> Tuberville Vs.
          Non-Conference Opponents</font></h3>
        <P>  Tommy Tuberville
          is 16-0 as a head coach versus non-conference opponents. Tuberville
          won all 13 non-conference games at Ole Miss and all three in his first
          season on the Plains. </font>
        <h3> Versus The Mountain
          West</font></h3>
        <P>  This is Auburn's
          first game against a Mountain West Conference opponent. In his five
          prior seasons as a head coach, Tommy Tuberville has not faced a Mountain
          West foe. </font>
        <h3> Dye Donned Cowboy
          Colors</font></h3>
        <P>  Former Auburn coach
          Pat Dye was Wyoming's head coach in 1980 prior to his 12-year career
          as head coach of the Tigers. Dye posted a 6-5 mark during his brief
          stint in Laramie. </font>
        <h3> Mazzone’s Faced
          ‘Em</font></h3>
        <P>  Auburn offensive
          coordinator Noel Mazzone has coached on two teams that have faced Wyoming.
          As a graduate assistant in 1980 at New Mexico, the Lobos lost to Pat
          Dye's Wyoming squad, 24-21. As an assistant at Colorado State from 1982-86,
          Mazzone coached against the Cowboys in four consecutive years. </font>
        <h3> Auburn on Thursday
          Nights</font></h3>
        <P>  The Wyoming game
          marks Auburn's third Thursday evening game in the last four years. Auburn
          opened the 1997 season with a 28-17 win at Virginia. The Tigers and
          Cavaliers began the 1998 campaign with a Thursday night game., falling
          to Virginia, 19-0. </font>
        <P>  In 1994, Auburn
          defeated Kentucky, 41-14, on a Thursday night game in Jordan-Hare Stadium
          and the Tigers and Ole Miss Rebels opened the 1993 season on Thursday
          night in Auburn. Auburn won the contest, 16-12. </font>
        <P>  ESPN was slated
          to televise the Tigers 1995 game against Mississippi State, however
          Hurricane Opal ripped through Lee County on the Wednesday before the
          game, causing the contest to be moved to Saturday due to massive power
          failures throughout the region. </font>
        <h3> Auburn in August</font></h3>
        <P>  The August 31st
          opener is the fourth game in Auburn's history that has been played during
          the month of August. The Tigers are 2-1 in August, with victories in
          Jordan-Hare Stadium over UAB (29-0) in 1996 and Georgia Southern (32-17)
          in 1991. Auburn's lone August loss was to Miami, 20-18, in the 1984
          Kickoff Classic in East Rutherford, N.J. </font>
        <P>  This is Auburn's
          second earliest beginning to a season. The 1984 Kickoff Classic was
          played on August 28, with Auburn's 1991 and 1996 August games also being
          contested on August 31st. </font>
        <h3> History Lesson
          101</font></h3>
        <P>  Auburn’s opener
          with Wyoming marks the second time in school history that the Tigers
          have played a school nicknamed the Cowboys. Auburn defeated the Hardin-Simmons
          Cowboys, 35-12, on Oct. 3, 1959, in the Tigers’ home opener in then
          Cliff Hare Stadium. </font>
        <P>  What was also so
          significant about the Hardin-Simmons game in 1959? It marked the birth
          of Aubie, Auburn’s popular mascot. Aubie’s existence began as a cartoon
          charater that appeared on the game progam that day in 1959. Birmingham
          Post-Herald artist Phil Neel created the cartoon Tiger who continued
          to adorn Auburn program covers for 18 years. </font>
        <h3> He’s Got His Degree</font></h3>
        <P>  Starting quarterback
          Ben Leard graduated Aug. 14 with a degree in Mass Communications. Leard
          spent this past summer interning with the Auburn Network and the Hughston
          Clinic. </font>
        <P>  Leard is now concentrating
          on a master’s degree, majoring in higer education administration with
          a minor in sports administration. </font>
        <h3> Prime Time</font></h3>
        <P>  Sophomore wide
          receiver Ronney Daniels stole the spotlight as a freshman while playing
          on ESPN and ESPN2. In five televised games on the two all-sports networks,
          Daniels had 27 catches for 596 yards and six touchdowns for an average
          of 5.4 catches and 119.2 yards per contest. </font>
        <P>  Quarterback Ben
          Leard posted big numbers as well on the two networks last season in
          three games against LSU, Georgia, and Alabama. Leard was 66-of-94 (70.2%)
          for 957 yards with nine touchdowns and one interception. </font>
        <h3> Semesters Are Here</font></h3>
        <P>  Besides the new-look
          locker rooms in Jordan-Hare Stadium this season, another new look will
          be the increased Auburn student attendance for its early season home
          games. For the first time in over 50 years, Auburn University has switched
          to the semester system instead of the quarter system used in previous
          years. The fall semester at Auburn began on Tuesday, August 22. </font>
        <h3> Dillard Connection</font></h3>
        <P>  Since former coach
          Pat Dye signed TB Otis Mounds from Dillard High School in Ft. Lauderdale,
          Fla., in 1990, Auburn has had a pipeline of players from the south Florida
          school. </font>
        <P>  This season, Dillard
          products DB Junior Rosegreen and WR Joe Walkins are freshmen on Auburn’s
          team. Rosegreen and Walkins are two of nine recent AU players to have
          hailed from Dillard. </font>
        <P>  Dillard alums that
          played at Auburn include Mounds, WR Frank Sanders, RB James Bostic,
          DB Calvin Jackson, DB Brian Robinson, DL Charles Dorsey and DL James
          Roscoe. </font>
        <P>  Bostic, Sanders,
          Jackson, Robinson and Mounds all played at Auburn during the Tigers’
          perfect 11-0 season in 1993. </font>
        <P>  Bostic and Sanders
          both became All-Americans at Auburn and today continue professional
          careers in the NFL. </font>
        <h3> Pre-Season All-SEC</font></h3>
        <P>  Auburn wide receiver
          Ronney Daniels and defensive back Larry Casher were named to the 2000
          Preseason All-SEC team. The team was chosen by media members at the
          SEC Media Days in July. </font>
        <P>  Quarterback Ben
          Leard and punter Damon Duval were tabbed to the second team. </font>
        <P>  A sophomore, Daniels
          set Auburn’s single-season record with 1,068 receiving yards in 1999.
          The Lake Wales, Fla., native was a freshman All-American and the SEC
          Freshman of the Year. </font>
        <P>  A senior from Prichard,
          Ala., Casher was an Associated Press All-SEC pick last season after
          notching 41 tackles. </font>
        <P>  Leard set four
          Auburn single-season records as a junior last season. He threw for 1,423
          yards and 12 touchdowns despite missing four games due to injuries.
          </font>
        <P>  Duval, a sophomore
          from Chattanooga, Tenn., was second in the SEC and 18th nationally in
          punting as a freshman. </font>
        <h3> On the Tube</font></h3>
        <P>  Three of Auburn’s
          games will be nationally televised by ESPN and ESPN2. The Tigers Sept.
          9 game at Ole Miss will be televised by ESPN2 and the LSU game on Sept.
          16 will be aired by ESPN. </font>
        <P>  Auburn has appeared
          on ESPN 41 times in the last 16 seasons. ESPN has televised at least
          two of the Tigers games in each of the last six seasons with the Auburn-Alabama
          game appearing on ESPN the last five consecutive years. </font>
        <P>  ESPN2 meanwhile
          has televised five Tiger games since 1996, with Auburn holding a 5-0
          record in those contests. </font>
        <P>  The Tigers are
          22-18-2 all-time on ESPN. </font>
        <P>  Auburn has had
          10 consecutive SEC and 17 of its last 18 conference games televised
          live by either CBS, ESPN, ESPN2, Fox Sports South or Jefferson Pilot.
          </font>
