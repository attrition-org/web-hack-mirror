<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  Ole Miss quarterback Romaro Miller hit Corey Peterson on a 23-yard touchdown pass play in overtime to give the Rebels a 24-17 victory over Auburn at Jordan-Hare Stadium Saturday afternoon.  The game marks the first time Ole Miss has won a football game at Auburn.  With the loss the Tigers fall to 3-1 overall and 1-1 in the conference.  Ole Miss is also 3-1 on the season and 1-1 in the conference after the victory.
<p>
	Auburn also loss starting quarterback Ben Leard to a shoulder contusion early in the third quarter.  The junior from Hartwell, Georgia is doubtful for next week.  How long Leard will be out exactly will be determined next week.
<p>
	Ole Miss struck first in the game on a 54-yard touchdown pass from Miller to Peterson with 11:53 remaining in the first quarter.  Auburn answered to make the score 7-3 when Damon Duval connected on a 27-yard field goal to cap off a 15 play, 71-yard drive with 5:09 left in the first quarter.
<p>
	Deuce McAllister gave the Rebels a 14-3 lead on a 2-yard run midway through the second quarter.  It looked like Ole Miss would take that advantage into the lockerroom until Travarius Robinson blocked a Reagan King punt and Rashaud Walker recovered the block in the endzone for a touchdown to cut the Ole Miss lead to 14-10 going to half.
<p>
	The two defenses took over in the second half with Auburn's only points coming on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Jeff Klein to Ryan Hooker late in the third quarter.  Ole Miss managed only a 45-yard field goal to tie the game at 17-17 at the 5:03 mark of the fourth quarter.  Auburn had a chance to win the game in regulation, but placekicker Damon Duval missed on a 37-yard field goal with :17 seconds remaining in regulation.
<p>
	Auburn had 270 yards of total offense, while Ole Miss had 295 yards.  Neither team ran the ball well with the Tigers managing only 58 yards on the ground, while Ole Miss rushed for 53 yards as a team.  Ole Miss outpassed Auburn 242 yards to 212 yards.
<p>
	Ole Miss quarterback Romaro Miller threw for all 242 of Ole Miss' passing yards, completing 17-29 with two touchdowns and an interception.  Auburn QB Jeff Klein was 10-of-16 for 112 yards and a touchdown.  Before his injury Ben Leard was 14-of-17 for 100 yards.
<p>
	The Rebels' Corey Peterson led all receivers with six catches for 113 yards and two TD's.  Auburn was led by Markeith Cooper who caught nine passes for 49 yards and Reggie Worthy who had five receptions for 48 yards.
<p>
	Auburn plays again next Saturday versus defending national champion Tennessee Volunteers.  Auburn and Tennessee meet in Neyland Stadium at a time to be determined.  The two teams will kick-off at either 2:30 p.m. CT or 6:30 p.m. CT.  Be sure to check back later for the exact start time for the Auburn-Tennessee football game.
