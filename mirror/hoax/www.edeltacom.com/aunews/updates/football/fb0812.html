<p><b>August 12, 2000</b></p>


<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  Auburn went through its first day in full pads with a
pair of practices on the intramural fields Saturday.  The Tigers spent
the beginning of the afternoon practice with position coaches before
concluding the last half of practice in team drills.
        <P>Head Coach Tommy Tuberville was pleased with the offense, while
noting that Auburn's young defense still has to make progress.

    <P>    "We worked a lot on play action and running the ball today," 
Tuberville said.  "The offense looked pretty good.  I think our
offensive line is getting a lot better.  We've got some competition,
which has made for a better last couple of days on offense--especially
on the offensive line.  We have a good battle going on at tight end and
wide receiver.  Things are looking up (offensively).

<P>        "We've got a long way to go on defense.  We're playing so many
young guys, they're making a lot of mistakes.  We are probably going to
cut back a little bit on what we're doing on defense.  We need to cut
back on mistakes before we can have any controlled scrimmaging."

        <P>For a second consecutive day, Tuberville was delighted by the
work of some of the special teams players, most notably sophomore kicker
Damon Duval.

    <P>    "(Damon) Duval is kicking excellent.  He hasn't missed one
(field goal) in two days and not just the short ones, but the long ones
too.  Our deep snappers are getting better, so we're making progress."
 
<P>        The Tigers will hold one practice tomorrow beginning at 5 p.m.
on the intramural fields.

     <P>   All practice sessions until August 20 will be held on the
intramural fields.  They are open to the public.
