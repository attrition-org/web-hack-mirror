<p><b>October 30, 1999</b></p>


<p><b>FAYETTEVILLE, AR</b>-  Senior quarterback Clint Stoerner keyed two first quarter touchdown drives to lead the Arkansas Razorbacks to a 34-10 victory over Auburn in SEC western division play.
<p>	The Razorbacks took the opening possession of the game and drove 80 yards in nine plays.  Senior running back Chrys Chukwuma ran for 35 yards on the drive. The Hogs grabbed the lead on a five-yard pass from Stoerner to tight end Joe Dean Davenport.
<p>	After an Auburn punt, Arkansas duplicated the 80-yard, nine-play drive, again capping the possession with a seven-yard pass to Davenport.
<p>	Auburn moved to a first down at the Razorback 23 on their ensuing possession, but after a loss, followed by a penalty, Damon Duval missed a 46-yard field goal attempt.  On that series, Auburn starting quarterback Ben Leard suffered a concussion and was taken from the field on a stretcher.  He returned to the field in street clothes after being examined at a local hospital. 
<p>	Arkansas was in complete control for the remainder of the first half, adding two field goals to take a 20-0 advantage before Duval got Auburn on the scoreboard with a 47-yard field goal with 11 seconds left in the first half.
<p>Arkansas added touchdowns on their first two possessions of the second half to put the game out of reach.  Heath Evans capped a 52-yard fourth-quarter Auburn drive with a four-yard touchdown run for the final points of the game.
<p>	Neither team had a turnover, despite the fact that the game was played in a steady, and at times, drenching rain. Stoerner connected on 19 of 29 passes for 245 yards and three touchdowns to highlight the Arkansas (6-2; 2-2 SEC) win. Chukwuma ran for 115 yards on 19 carries.  
<p>The Tigers attack was led by Jeff Klein, who came off the bench to hit 12 for 22 passes for 74 yards.  Leard completed five passes on eight attempts for 41 yards before he was injured.  Evans ran for 68 yards on 15 carries.  Auburn (3-5; 1-5) returns to Jordan-Hare Stadium to face Central Florida in the Tigers homecoming game next Saturday.
