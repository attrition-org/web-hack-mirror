</UL>
<h1>Auburn Head Coach Tommy Tuberville</h1>
<P>"That was finally four quarters guys, that was a total team effort. We came down here to
   win the ball game. We were heavily underdogged on the road and I think that the guys took a
   little offense to that. But we are just taking them one at a time."
   <P>"I can't say enough about Ben Leard and his attack versus the blitz tonight. They (LSU)
   weren't going to let us run the ball early and we just picked them apart on the blitz and that's
   what this offense is all about."
   <P>"Defensively, we got after them from the word go. Kicking game - we tried a few new
   wrinkles. Coach Tuberville's back."
        <P>We came in relaxed and we weren't intimidated. We made a few mistakes early with the
   crowd but we did exactly what we wanted to to take the crowd out of it. LSU played hard but the
   best football team won this football game today from the beginning to the end.  I take it off to
   these kids, they've been through a lot these last few years. And I think the nation...weIl a lot of
   them turned it off ...but the nation saw in the first half these guys got a lot of heart and that things
   are getting better and better. It was just a total team effort I can't single out any one person."
   <h3>LSU HEAD COACH  --  DINARDO QUOTES</h3>
   <P><B>When asked about his team's play, head coach Gerry DiNardo offered,</B><BR>
  "On defense, they audibled out to some shifts that caught us off guard. On offense, we had some
  penalties, which we'd been good about up till now."
  <P><B>Asked about the play of the wideouts, DiNardo said,</B><BR>
  "We could've caught the ball a little better, we didn't play as well as we could."
  <P><B>When asked about the play of Josh Booty, Dinardo commented</B><BR>
  "Josh played well. I thought a few balls floated on him early, but everyone I think played better in
  the second half, and he benefitted from that. He saw some things for the first time, and any time
  you have a five year layover, you'll be facing some new things."
<P><B>On whether or not he makes changes to the plan for Georgia, DiNardo said,</B><BR> "It's too early to
  tell."
<P>DiNardo stressed throughout the press conference that this was only a game, and LSU could
  recover.<P>"I don't worry about games like this. A year ago we beat Mississippi State here 41-6, and if you
  remember, they won the SEC West."
<P><B>Asked about the quarterback situation, Coach DiNardo said,</B><BR> "We're going to start Josh against
  Georgia, and let him get settled in.
<h1>Auburn Player Quotes</h1>
<P>Unavailable.
<h1>LSU Player Quotes</h1>
<h3>LSU QB Josh Booty:</h3>
<P>"With the circumstances like they were, we got behind really quick and it was tough when you
   have too play catchup against a team with that good of a front four. It was tough to play uphill
   against a team with a pass rush like that. The line did a good job but it's hard to score points
   when you are in a hole."
   <P><B>On watching Rohan Davey stuggle early:</B><BR>
   "In my mind I told myself I would probably get a chance soon and it was just a matter of time
   until I got a shot. I didn't do bad. The first half I threw one ball in the deep middle that was
   intercepted and Abram tipped one ball."
<h3>LSU DE Jarvis Green:</h3>
<P>"In the first (quarter) we had a chance. After that the offense couldn't be productive and the
   defense, at a certain point we couldn't hold them any more."
<P>"What they did was what we practiced. We left open spots in the secondary and they got the big
   play and that is what killed us."
<P>"The same thing happened when Mississippi State came in here (last year) and got beat but they
   still won the west. We are looking at it the same way. We will get our team together and keep
   playing football."
<h3>LSU WR Jerel Myers:</h3>
<P>"I think I played a decent game. As far as the team goes, I don't think I did all what I could have
   done. We are going to get better."
<P>On the 13 catches (2nd most in LSU History)
<P>"It feels good. But whether you have 13 or you have one, as long as I help the team I feel good."
