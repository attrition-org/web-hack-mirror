<p><b>August 10, 2000</b></p>

<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  Jimmy Perry has been named the Director of High School Relations 

at Auburn University announced head football coach Tommy Tuberville Thursday.

        <P>Perry will serve as a liaison between the Auburn football coaching staff and high school
coaches in the southeast.  He will also handle NFL relations.

    <P>    "We're excited about having Jimmy join our staff," Tuberville said. "One of our main
objectives when we came to Auburn was to improve relationships with high school coaches in the
southeast.  With the hiring of Jimmy, we are taking a positive step in that direction.

<P>        "Jimmy has been involved in high school athletics for a number of years and has been very
successful.  I think his background and experience will greatly benefit our program."

        <P>Perry comes to Auburn from Robert E. Lee High School in Montgomery where he has served as
the head football coach and athletic director since 1995.   He guided Robert E. Lee to a runner-up
finish in the 6A state championship in 1999 and to consecutive area championships in 1997 and 1998.
His 1995 and 1996 teams advanced to the state quarterfinals, with the 1996 squad earning a national
ranking of 22nd by USA Today.

    <P>    Perry has coached in the high school ranks since 1979.  He was the offensive coordinator
at Robert E. Lee from 1982-1995 and an assistant at Trinity Presbyterian in Montgomery from
1979-1982.

        <P>"I am looking forward to working with Coach Tuberville and the Auburn coaching staff,"
Perry said. "I have been impressed with Coach Tuberville's desire to improve communication with the
high school programs in this state and region.  I look forward to helping the program improve and
grow."

    <P>    During his football coaching tenure, Perry earned three 6A Metro Coach of the Year honors
and was the 1995 Alabama Coaches Association Coach of the Year.
