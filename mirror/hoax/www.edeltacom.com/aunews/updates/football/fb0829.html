<br><B>AUBURN</B>-  The Tigers began earnest game-week preparations with a two-and-a-half-hour workout in shells on the practice fields behind the Athletic Complex Sunday.

<P>Auburn head coach Tommy Tuberville was pleased with the team's attitude although he said the timing was a little off after not practicing Friday afternoon and Saturday.

<P>"We had a good day of practice after having two days off," Tuberville said.  "I thought we were a little bit sluggish, but overall the attitude was great.  Everybody was back to practice except for a few players that had bumps and bruises.  I was a little bit disappointed in the conditioning at the end, but overall, I thought practice was enthusiastic."

<P>With the season opener less than a week away, Auburn concentrated on the Appalachian State game plan during the session.

<P>"We started working more on Appalachian State today.  We put in things that we feel like can work and we dropped a few things from the game plan.  We added a few things on defense.  Everything is starting to come together."

<P>Tuberville cited the play of place kicker Rob Bironas who has showed improvement after struggling the first week of two-a-days.

<P>"I was proud of Rob Bironas.  He had a great day.  He needed it.  It has been a long time since we have seen a ball go through the uprights."

<P>Auburn will practice Monday and Tuesday afternoon on the practice fields.  All practices are closed to the public.
