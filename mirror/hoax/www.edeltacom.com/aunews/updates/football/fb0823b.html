<P><B>AUBURN</B>- After a day off, the Tigers had a little more spring in their step as the team
    went through a two and a half hour workout on the practice fields behind the Athletic
    Complex Wednesday. Auburn spent the session working on the game plan for Wyoming
    and concentrating on team work. 
<p>
    Head Coach Tommy Tuberville was pleased with the attitude of his squad which worked
    in full gear in warm conditions. Auburn took the field at 3:30 p.m., an hour and half earlier
    than other preseason practices. 
<p>
    "I thought we had a good practice today," Tuberville said. "It was hot. It was the earliest
    practice we've had. But after a day of not practicing, we had pretty good enthusiasm. The
    concentration was a lot better. You can tell it's getting close to game time. We have a lot
    of injured guys that are getting back on the field. 
<p>
    "Everyday, we're going through every type of situation that we may run into in our game
    against Wyoming. We've practiced no-huddle, short yardage, long yardage, blitzing and a
    lot of play action. We spent about 35 minutes today on our game plan for Wyoming.
    We'll spend more time on that, but we're still going to do some team against ourselves to
    get our timing down." 
<p>
    Tuberville announced that three walk-on players, Larkin Deason, Dominicke Haston and
    Roderick Hood have been placed on scholarship. 
<p>
    Deason, a senior offensive lineman from Sprott, Ala., walked on to the team in 1996
    while Haston, a senior defensive back from Eight Mile joined the team in 1998. Hood,
    who is slated as the backup at rover, walked on last season after playing at Carver High
    School in Columbus. 
<p>
    Auburn will continue preparations for Wyoming with a 3:30 p.m. practice on Thursday.
    The Tigers' season opener against the Cowboys is August 31 at Jordan-Hare Stadium.
    The 7 p.m. game will be nationally televised by ESPN.
