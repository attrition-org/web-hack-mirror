<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  The Auburn football team had a two-hour practice that
was highlighted by a spirited and enthusiastic hour-plus session of team
drills on the intramural fields Sunday.  In their second day of full
gear the Auburn squad went through one practice, an afternoon session in
unseasonably pleasant weather.

<P>     Head Coach Tommy Tuberville was happy with the spirits of the
club and talked about the squad's practice during the upcoming final
week of two-a-days.

        <P>"We had a pretty good practice, the guys were in good spirits
when the sun went down,"  Tuberville said.  "I thought we had a little
more enthusiasm.  

    <P>    "I told the team that we are going to make this football team in
the next five days.  We are going to have a tough next five days.  If we
can survive that and the guys get better and learn more, we can have a
pretty good team.  We've got to have more contact this week and hope
that nobody gets hurt."   

<P>        Tuberville also discussed the running game and the work of
juniors Rudi Johnson and Heath Evans.

        <P>"I'm really impressed with our running backs.  Rudi is looking
like the Rudi of last spring.  He's moving laterally a lot better than
when he first got here.  I think he was a bit stiff from lifting weights
all summer.  He's really coming around."  

    <P>    "Of course Heath is getting better every day.  He can play
fullback, tailback, catch the ball and block.  He's got a long year in
front of him because he's got a lot to learn.  He's going to be a real
asset to the team." 
 
<P>        The Tigers will hold two practices tomorrow beginning at 7 a.m.
and 5 p.m. on the intramural fields. All practice sessions until August
20 will be held on the intramural fields and are open to the public.

        <P>Auburn opens the 2000 season on August 31 at 7 p.m. against
Wyoming in Jordan-Hare Stadium.  The game will be televised nationally
by ESPN.
