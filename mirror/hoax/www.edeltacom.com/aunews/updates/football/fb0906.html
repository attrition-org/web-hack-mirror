<p><b>September 6, 2000</b></p>


<p><B>AUBURN</B>- For the second consecutive day the Auburn football team
was forced to practice in the indoor practice facility due to inclement
weather.  Dressed in pads and shorts, the squad had a split session with
the defense utilizing the indoor facility for the first half of
practice, while the offense was indoors for the remainder of practice. 

   <p>     Head Coach Tommy Tuberville addressed the lack of a full outdoor
practice as the team readies for Saturday's conference opener. 

    <p>    "It's been about the same as all week.  We haven't been able to
get outside,"  Tuberville said.  "It's been too wet, so we've just been
walking through.  There is going to be a real concern about timing,
hand-offs and snap counts, but there is not a lot we can do.  Our indoor
facility is not big enough to handle both the offense and defense at the
same time.  Hopefully we'll be able to get out tomorrow."  

    <p>    Tuberville also discussed the health of the squad that has had
numerous players feeling under the weather.

  <p>      "We still have a bunch of guys that are not feeling well and are
dragging around,"  Tuberville said.   "They are going to have to work
through it and get 100 percent by Saturday." 

   <p>     Auburn will practice on Thursday afternoon in final preparations
for Saturday's Southeastern Conference opener at Ole Miss.  Nationally
televised by ESPN2, kickoff at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium in Oxford is set
for 6 p.m. CT.
