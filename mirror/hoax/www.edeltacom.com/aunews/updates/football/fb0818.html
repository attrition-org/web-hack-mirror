<P><B>AUBURN</B>-  Auburn's offense struggled in a two-hour workout in full gear on the intramural fields Friday afternoon, drawing the ire of head coach Tommy Tuberville.  Although Tuberville was satisfied with the play of his defensive unit, he was not pleased with the inconsistency shown on the offensive side of the ball.

       <P> "Defensively, we're either playing above our heads, or we're not playing well at all on offense," Tuberville said. "We made too many mistakes.  We're holding out a few starters at offensive line, wide receiver and running back, but we need to be better than we were tonight.  

      <P>  "We're not communicating or concentrating on what we're doing.  Our passing attack has struggled.  It's the end of two-a-days and hopefully that's what the reason is.  We're just making too many mistakes. We didn't accomplish much on offense and hopefully that's because our defense is playing a lot better than what we would have expected at this point."

      <P>  Two newcomers on defense,  Spencer Johnson, a freshman from Silas, Ala., and Alton Moore, a junior college transfer from Southwest Mississippi Junior College, caught the eye of Tuberville during the afternoon session.

       <P> "Defensively, we're playing with a lot of heart," said Tuberville.  "We're going to have to do that early.  We have some young guys who have really improved.  Spencer Johnson has really come a long way.  He might be the talk of the town if he plays the way he has been practicing.  He's playing well.  Alton Moore is also playing a lot better.  He's learning and he's back to being healthy."

      <P>  Auburn spent the late practice concentrating on team-work and several blitz, third-and-long and run drills.  The Tigers also practiced for an hour and a half in the morning in shells.  

      <P>  The Tigers will practice twice Saturday with the morning session at 7 a.m. and the afternoon practice taking place at 5:30 p.m.  Fan Day is slated for 1-3 p.m. at Beard-Eaves-Memorial Coliseum.  Admission is free.
