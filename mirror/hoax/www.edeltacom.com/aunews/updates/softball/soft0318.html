<P><B>BATON ROUGE, La.</B>-  Auburn let game one slip away 6-5 and but rebounded to take game two 2-1 in a doubleheader at 8th-ranked LSU Friday night. Auburn's record goes to 21-10, while LSU goes to 20-7. LSU becomes the highest-ranked team Auburn has ever beaten.
<P> "We came out strong in game one, but we just couldn't sustain it," Auburn coach Tina Deese said.
<P>Game one saw LSU score six runs on six hits in the sixth inning to erase a five-run lead Auburn carried into the inning. Jennifer Schuelke's  2-RBI double with the bases loaded highlighted the inning for LSU. Shaunte Fremin, Stacey Newton, and Ashley Lewis each added RBI in that inning.
<P>Auburn took a 5-0 lead in the third inning. Three of those runs came on a 3-RBI triple to center field by freshman Jodie Van Ooyen with two outs. Van Ooyen scored on a wild pitch later in the inning.
<P>After that, Auburn's bats lay dormant, with the Tigers managing just three hits for the remainder of the game. Jen Lofton (9-6) pitched the final one and two-third innings to get the loss. Lofton came on in the sixth inning with one out and the game tied at five and gave up the winning run on the 2-RBI double by Schuelke. Julie Stashko (5-0) earned the win for LSU. Britni Sneed pitched the final two innings, striking out four, to earn her fourth save of the season.
 <P>    Auburn took a 1-0 lead in the third inning of game two on a solo home run to left field by Ashley Moore, her third of the season. LSU answered in the fourth inning when Dee Douglas scored on a sacrifice fly from Stephanie Hastings to knot the game at one.
<P>     Auburn went back ahead in the bottom of the seventh when Mary Petrie doubled down the  right field line. Two batters later, Kimball Pratt singled to center field to score pinch-runner Kim Freeland from second base and provide the Tigers with the winning 2-1 margin. Petrie (3-0) got the win for the Tigers, pitching the final three and two-third innings.
<P>     Auburn continues its series at LSU with a doubleheader at 1 p.m. Saturday.
