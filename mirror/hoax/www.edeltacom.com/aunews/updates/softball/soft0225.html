<P><B>February 25, 2000</B></P>


<P><B>TAMPA, Fla.</B>-  The Auburn Tigers (12-6) defeated their first opponent in the University of Florida/Gladstones Tournament, the Indiana Hoosiers (0-1) by a score of 4-3.  This was Indiana's first game of the season.  The No. 6 Michigan Wolverines (4-2) defeated Auburn 10-3 in Auburn's first game against a nationally ranked team.
<P>    Right-hander Jaime Rasmussen pitched 4.1 innings, allowed two runs and struck out three batters for the Tigers.  In the bottom of the first, leftfielder Melissa Narewski scored the first run for the Hoosiers by hitting a RBI double to left center, scoring senior Sheri Savko.  Later, Narewski would score off of a single to right by pitcher Teresa Martinez.  Auburn would respond in the top of the second inning when the designated player, Becky Cleary, reached first base on an error by Indiana's shortstop, allowing Michelle Martin to score from third base.  In the same inning, Jodie Van Ooyen would reach home after Kimball Pratt hit a RBI single.  The game would stay tied at two until the sixth inning when Jen Hammock, pinch runner for Deni Zeigler, scored on a sacrifice bunt by Cleary.  Van Ooyen scores from third on another Pratt RBI single.  Indiana would try to stay in the game with pinch runner Monique Bullock scoring on an error by Auburn's shortstop.  This brought the Hoosiers within one run of a tie with Auburn.  After Bullock scored, shortstop Lauren Hendrix struck out swinging, ending the game with Auburn winning 4-3.  Auburn pitcher Jen Lofton (5-2) came into the game for Rasmussen in the fifth inning and was credited with the win.  Indiana's Teresa Martinez (0-1) pitched a complete game, allowing 10 hits, four runs, and struck out only one batter.
<P>    In Auburn's second game of the day, the score was tied at one until the top of the third when Michigan's Marissa Young hit a grand slam home run to score Pam Kosanke, Stefanie Volpe and Melissa Taylor.  Marcella Passarelli contributed by hitting a solo home run to bring the Tigers make the score 9-3.  Auburn would not be able to get any closer to the Wolverines, as they would score one more time in the fifth to win over Auburn 10-3.
<P>    Sophomore centerfielder Ashley Moore is currently on a six-game hitting streak, while junior Jen Kramer is in the middle of a three-game hitting streak.
<P>    "This is a great tournament for us to be in," says Head Coach Tina Deese, "It is good for us to see this type of competition.  This will prepare us for the SEC.  Our young kids are learning.  We lost to a good team in Michigan.  They just flat out beat us."
<P>    The Auburn Tigers continue play in the University of South Florida/Gladstones Tournament Saturday, Feb. 26, at 10 a.m. ET against the No. 18 South Carolina Gamecocks (7-4) and at 6 p.m. versus the University of South Florida Bulls (4-15).
