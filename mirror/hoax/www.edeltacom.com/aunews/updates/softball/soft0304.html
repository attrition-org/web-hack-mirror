<P><B>AUBURN</B>-  A game-winning RBI single by Michelle Martin gave Auburn (16-9, 1-1) its first SEC win of the season as the Tigers took game two 4-3 in a double header against 18th-ranked South Carolina (11-7, 1-1).  Jen Lofton (8-5) came in for relief in the seventh to earn the win.  USC's Megan Matthews (7-6) pitched two innings and gave up three runs for the loss.  In game one, the Lady Gamecocks beat Auburn 5-3.  Matthews pitched a complete game for the win while Lofton recorded the loss.  
<P>"The bats finally came back.  I feel we hit the ball very well.  It has been a while since we have gotten clutch hits and today we were able to string several together to come back and win.  Michelle's clutch was perfect," said Head Coach Tina Deese.  "I am really proud of our pitching today, specially Jen Joiner in game two.  There were times where she could have folded but she toughened up and that is what we need."    
<P>Heading into the sixth, AU was down 3-1 with two outs before Deni Zeigler and Marcella Passarelli each hit RBI singles to tie the game.  Lofton came in for the top of the seventh to hold the Gamecocks.  The Tigers had two outs in the bottom of the seventh inning when Ashley Moore scored the winning run on the RBI single by Martin.  
<P>In game one, AU took an early 1-0 lead before USC scored three in the third to pull ahead 3-1.  Auburn answered with back-to-back doubles and a sacrifice fly to score two runs in the bottom of the third to tie the game.  However, South Carolina regained the lead when Danielle Quinones singled to score two runs for the Gamecocks.  The two runs would be all USC would need as Auburn fell 5-3. 
<P>The win in game two marks the second time this season Auburn has defeated South Carolina and a ranked team.  The Tigers are 2-8 overall against the Gamecocks and 3-2 against ranked teams this season.   
<P>Auburn returns to action next Friday when they host the War Eagle Classic.  AU will play Creighton at 9:30 a.m. and Miami-Ohio at 1:30 p.m.  The times for the tournament were changed to 9:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 1:30 p.m., 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. On Saturday, the Tigers will face Akron and Indiana.
