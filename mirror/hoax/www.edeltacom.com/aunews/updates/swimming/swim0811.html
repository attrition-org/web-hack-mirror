<p><b>August 11, 2000</b></p>


<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  Auburn swimmer Pat Calhoun made the United States Olympic Team after
finishing second in the 100-meter breaststroke at the U.S. Olympic Team Trials Thursday.  

<P>        Calhoun, a sophomore, finished in a time of 1:01.09 while winner Ed Moses swam an American
record time of 1:00.44.   Calhoun, a native of Seymour, Ind. which is an hour south of the site of
the trials, swam the third fastest time in the world this year.

<P>        "It was awesome," Calhoun said. "This is a chance to represent my country and it is
amazing.  There were a lot of people from Seymour here and they were all behind me.  Their cheering
helped me a lot."

    <P>    Calhoun was the SEC Co-Performer at the 2000 SEC Swimming Championships.  He finished fifth
at the NCAA Championships in the 100m breaststroke.

        <P>"Ultimately, this is what it is all about," Auburn head swim coach David Marsh said. "It's
inconceivable how dreams can come true.  Pat came into the meet not even on the world rankings and
to swim the third fastest time in the world this year is just amazing.  He elevated in a pressure
situation in the best way possible."

<P>        Calhoun is the ninth Auburn swimmer to qualify for the Olympics.  He is the fifth Auburn
swimmer to make the United States Olympic team and the first to qualify in a breaststroke event.

    <P>    Two other Auburn swimmers finished in the top eight during the second day of the trials.
Kevin Clements, a junior from Rowland Heights, Ca. was fourth in the 400m medley in a time of
4:20.26 while David Denniston, a senior from Littleton, Co., was sixth in the 100m breaststoke with
a time of 1:02.32.
