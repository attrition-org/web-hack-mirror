<p><b>March 18, 2000</b></p>

<P><b>INDIANAPOLIS, Ind.</b>-Auburn held on to its fifth-place finish in a close race against Northwestern and Southern California.  The Tigers 400m free relay team of Rada Owen, Jen Woolf, Brook Monroe and Katie Ryan finished sixth in the 400m free relay with a time of 3:42.77 to score 26 points and hold the fifth place finish in the meet.  The Tigers fifth-place finish ties the school record for highest finish at the NCAA Championships.  AU also placed fifth at the Championships in 1994.
<P>"I am happy for this senior class because they tied the highest school finish in Auburn history and the highest finish of their four years," head coach David Marsh said.  "Rada went out in classic style with a career best lead off on the relay."
<P>Brook Monroe was the Tigers highest individual finisher for day three as she finished seventh in the 200m breast with a time of 2:28.68.  Auburn earned 27 All-America honors, 18 All-America, nine honorable mention, at the 2000 Championships.  Senior Mimi Bowen closed her career with 19 total honors while Katie Ryan finished with 14, Rada Owen with 13, Annemieke McReynolds with nine and Cathy Sursi with three.
<P>"All of our seniors showed leadership and success for the Auburn program.  Mimi Bowen won two SEC titles for the first time this year and four consecutive in the 100 fly represents the direction this program is headed," Marsh said.  "Katie Ryan recorded career bests this year as did Cathy Sursi and Annemieke McReynolds, despite injuries throughout her career, as well.  When you still have seniors performing lifetime bests, that is a sign of success."
<P>     Auburn was only able to advance in two events for the finals session of day three.  Junior Jen Woolf missed the finals heat by three-hundreths of a second (.03) as she swam 55.81 in the 100m free to finish 17th and Maggie Bowen finished 18th in the 200 fly with a time of 2:13.91.  Bowen was AU's highest point scorer with 32 followed by Monroe with 27 and Owen with 26.
<P>The 2000 NCAA Championships will be televised by ESPN on tape delay with the scheduled air date set for Mar. 24, 2-3:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
