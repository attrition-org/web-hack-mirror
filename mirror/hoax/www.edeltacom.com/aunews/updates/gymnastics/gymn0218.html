<P><B>MUNCIE, Ind.</B>-  The Auburn Gymnastics team scored a season-high and the fourth
highest score in school history despite losing to Ball State 194.325-194.300 Friday night.
The margin of defeat is the smallest that you can have in gymnastics. Senior Sarah
Wentworth won the all around, 39.200, and junior Sally Cantrell finished second with a
career-high 39.100.
<P>The Tigers opened the meet on bars and struggled a little bit, but held a slight 47.975-
47.850 lead. Wentworth, who is ranked number one in Region IV, won the event for the
third straight meet with a 9.850. Cantrell scored a 9.750 and Cheryl Lancaster posted a
9.700, for second and third on the team, respectively.
<P>"This was a turning point of our season," head coach Jeff Thompson said. "To get off to
the slow start that we did and come back and hit vault is great. We had some problems
on floor with the music, but the girls did a great job working around the problems. They
rocked on beam and nearly pulled out the meet. "
<P>Auburn made up for the shortcomings on bars with a season-high 48.450 on Vault
sweeping the top four spots. Wentworth finished first with a career-high 9.750. Missy
Lauderdale and Cantrell finished second with a 9.725, which is a season-high and career-
high, respectively, The Tigers trailed 96.625-96.475 at the midway point.
<P>On floor Auburn gained some ground scoring a 48.875, which is the second highest score
on the season. Sophomore Terri Brannan led the team with a career-high 9.825,
following close behind was freshman Mary Nell Pate with a 9.800. The Tigers trailed
145.475-145.300 after three rotations.
<P>The Tigers equaled their total on floor with the same 48.850 on beam in the final rotation.
Cantrell won the event with her third 9.900 on the season. Wentworth finished second in
the meet with a 9.825 and Lancaster tied for third with a 9.800.
<P>The Tigers return home next Friday February 25, in a SEC showdown with two-time
defending national champion Georgia in Beard-Eaves-Memorial Coliseum at 7 p.m.
(CSS), College Sports Southeast will televise the meet live, this will be the first-ever live
televised gymnastics meet in the state of Alabama.
