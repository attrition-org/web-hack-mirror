<P><B>March 5, 2000</B></P>


<P><B>SHREVPORT, La.</B>-  The Auburn gymnastics team shattered the old school record by over two points with a 196.825-191.550 victory over Centenary, Sunday in Shreveport, La.  Senior Sarah Wentworth scored the first 10.000 on bars in Auburn history, junior Sally Cantrell won the all-around with a career-high 39.350.  The Tigers scored school records on three of the four events.
<P>Auburn scored a school-record 49.500 on bars to open up the meet behind career-highs from all six gymnasts.  The previous school high was a 49.075 back in 1993.  Wentworth led with her first 10.000 of her career and first 10.000 at Auburn since 1993.  Cantrell and Cheryl Lancaster scored a 9.925, Mary Nell Pate and Stacy Jewett scored a 9.775 and Lori Bernia scored a 9.875.  The Tigers swept the top four spots on bars.
 <P>The Tigers continued to break records scoring a season-high and fourth highest score in school history on vault with a 48.875 behind a career-high 9.900 from Missy Lauderdale.  Wentworth had to be pulled from the meet after injuring her left knee on her first vault and will see team doctors upon return to Auburn.  Stephani Janes scored a career-high 9.850.  Cantrell and Lancaster scored a 9.750 and 9.725 respectively.  Auburn had a 98.375-94.750 lead after two rotations.
<P>"We did today what we have been capable of doing all along," Auburn head coach Jeff Thompson.  "It was incredible that our only fall on the whole day was when Wentworth was injured.  I am extremely proud of the way the team handled themselves after the injury pulling together as a team."
<P>On floor another school record was rewritten as the Tigers scored a 49.200 to tie the old record.  Jennifer Ross scored a career-high 9.900 and Lauderdale had a career-high 9.875.  Cantrell added a career-high 9.800.
<P>On beam the Tigers posted a school record 49.250 led by freshman Cheryl Lancaster with a 9.900.  Ross and Mary Nell Pate each added career-highs of 9.850 and 9.825 respectively.
<P>The Tigers return to action Saturday night at 7 p.m. as they host Southeast Missouri State and these same Centenary Ladies.  It will be the last home meet of the season and Senior Night inside Beard-Eaves-Memorial Coliseum. Auburn will honor Robin Doolittle, Laura Edmundson, Stacy Jewett and Sarah Wentworth.
