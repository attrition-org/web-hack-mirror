<P><B>February 11, 2000</B></P>


<P><B>AUBURN</B>-  First-year head coach Jeff Thompson recorded his first career victory, as Auburn (1-5, 0-3) knocked off Illinois State (10-3), 193.550-191.750,  Friday night in gymnastics action. The Tigers swept bars and floor and had two gymnasts in the top three spots on each event and in the all-around.
<P>Junior Sally Cantrell won the all-around for the second straight week, the Tampa, Fla. native posted a 38.800. Freshmen Cheryl Lancaster scored a 9.875 on beam to win the event for the second consecutive meet.
<P>Cantrell's 38.800 in the all-around is her third-highest total of the season, and she is the only Tiger to win the all-around this year.  Wentworth was close behind in second with a 38.775, that total included a fall on beam which is an automatic .5 deduction.
<P>"It feels good to get this first win," Thompson said.  "I told the girls it's not about winning or losing at this point, it's about going out and hitting our routines everytime.  We can't count two falls at the end of the season if we want to be competitive."
<P>Auburn took the lead from the beginning posting a season-high 48.325 on vault.  Senior co-captain Sarah Wentworth led the team with a 9.700 and sophomore Stephani Janes scored a 9.675 using only one of her two vaults.  They finished second and third respectively behind Heather Mohler who scored a 9.725 for the Redbirds.
<P>Wentworth is the top-ranked gymnast on bars in Region IV and she proved why, scoring a 9.875 to win the event. Lancaster placed second with a 9.725.  Cantrell along with sophomore Lori Bernia tied for third with a 9.675.  The Tigers scored a 48.600 as a team increasing their lead to 96.925-95.575.
<P>On beam Auburn stumbled for the third straight meet having to count two falls, leading to a team score of 47.775.  Along with Lancaster's 9.875, Cantrell posted a 9.825 for second place on beam.  Janes also had a strong performance scoring a 9.700.
<P>The Tigers improved by over a point on floor from last week scoring a 48.850 tonight compared to a 47.575 last week against Florida, to put the meet away.  Wenworth won the event scoring a 9.850, sophomore Terri Brannan placed second, 9.800, and freshman Mary Nell Pate finished third, 9.775.
<P>Auburn hits the road next week as it takes on Ball State in Muncie, Ind. at 7 p.m. (CST).  Check the Auburn web site, <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/athletics/gym/livestats">www.auburn.edu/athletics/gym/livestats</a>, to see if the meet will be live on the internet.
