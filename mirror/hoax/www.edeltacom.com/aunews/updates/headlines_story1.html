<p><b>September 12, 2000</b></p>


<p><B>AUBURN</B>-  Auburn returned to the practice fields Tuesday after a day off and hit the ground running with a two and a half workout which culminated with conditioning.  Defensive Coordinator John Lovett was pleased with the team's enthusiasm during the session. 

   <p>     "It went pretty well out there today.  It went a little longer than we thought it would, but we had to clear up a few things," Lovett said.  "I was really pleased with the attitude and work ethic from the players today.  We're looking forward to a good week."

   <p>     Although LSU has a new coaching staff, Lovett said that the Tigers run a lot of the same formations they did a year ago.

  <p>      "LSU is similar on offense to what they did last year," Lovett explained.  "They play a lot with two tight ends and two backs.  They have two good, hard runners (LaBrandon Toefield and Domanick Davis) in the backfield.  They're really quick.  I've been impressed with their two tight ends (Joe Domingeaux and Robert Royal).  They look like they're physical and athletic players.  I think that's probably why they use a lot of two tight end sets.  They seem to be two of their best football players.

   <p>     "LSU has had two big wins and they have been productive on offense.  I think we'll have our hands full this weekend."

      <p>  LSU has averaged 488.5 yards on offense and 43 points a game in wins over Western Carolina and Houston.  

     <p>  Auburn and LSU kick off at 6:35 p.m. Saturday at Jordan-Hare Stadium in a game that will be televised nationally by ESPN.
