<p><b>August 8, 2000</b></p>


<p><b>AUBURN</b>-  The upcoming football and basketball seasons at Auburn are going to be special ones for fans of the Auburn Network, especially fans of the network’s announcer. This athletic season marks Jim Fyffe’s 20th anniversary as Auburn’s football and basketball radio play-by-play announcer and the Auburn Network is making plans to celebrate the milestone and honor the man whose cries of “Touchdown Auburn!” excite Tiger fans around the world. 

<P>"Jim Fyffe is an Auburn institution,” said Mike Hubbard, President of the Auburn Network. “He is, without a doubt, one of the best play-by-play men in the business today and for him to be behind the Auburn microphone for 20 years is a testament to his talent and to his popularity among Auburn people. We’re proud to have Jim as our lead announcer and believe this is a milestone that deserves to be celebrated.”

<P>A videotape chronicling Fyffe’s 20 years as the Auburn Network announcer is currently in production, Hubbard said. The video will provide behind-the-scenes looks at Auburn Network broadcasts as well as interviews with past and present coaches, players and broadcast team members. The video will also highlight dozens of Fyffe’s most memorable calls underneath the game action video.

<P>Additionally, a companion compact disc is being produced by the Auburn Network and will contain some of Fyffe’s greatest calls as well as Auburn music.  Both the video and CD will be available in early September. Both may be reserved by visiting the <a href=http://catalog.aunetwork.com target=top>Auburn Network Store</a>.

<P>Nationally known sports artist Michael Taylor has been commissioned to paint the cover artwork for the videotape and CD and features Fyffe in the Auburn Network broadcast booth. The artwork will also be provided as a four-color, foldout poster inside the Auburn Football Illustrated game program at the Auburn vs. Arkansas game on October 28.

<P>The network also plans to celebrate Fyffe’s 20th year through a series of interactive features on its website. One of the features will allow visitors to the site to listen to and select their all-time favorite Fyffe call.
