<P><B>January 8, 2000</B></P>


<P><B>AUBURN</B>-  Erin Gettle of Reading, Pa.; Addi Hundley of Tuscaloosa; Kristi Oppelt of Melbourne, Fla.; and Lael Paschal of Jacksonville, Fla., have signed national letters of intent to attend Auburn University and participate in gymnastics in the 2001 season, first-year head coach Jeff Thompson announced Wednesday.  Gettle is an Elite level gymnast while the trio are Level 10 gymnasts.
<P>Gentle, an Elite level gymnast at Berk's Gymnastics under coaches Tom McCarthy and Rich Fiorentino, represented the United States in international competition in Sweden and Scotland in 1997.  She also competed in the John Hancock U.S. Championships in 1998 and won the All-Around title at the 1998 USA Challenge.
<P>"We are very excited to have Erin join us at Auburn," Thompson said.  "Her experience at the national and international level will certainly help propel our team to new heights.  She is one of the nation's top recruits, so we are very, very happy that she has decided to come to Auburn."
<P>Hundley, a Level 10 gymnast at the Alabama Gymnastics Academy with the Bama Bounders competitive team, moved from her hometown of Dallas, Texas, to continue training with her coach, Tom Haley.  She was the 1998 Texas High School uneven bars champion, and the event champion on uneven bars, floor exercise and in the All-Around at the 1999 Alabama State Meet.
<P>"Addi's desire to continue her growth as a competitive gymnast will bring her into the national spotlight on several events at Auburn," Thompson said.  "She has an incredible amount of athletic talent, a strong work ethic and outstanding academics."
<P>Oppelt, a Level 10 gymnast who trains at Harbor City Gymnastics with Mark and Ann Weber, is a three-time National qualifier, a two-time Region 8 uneven bar Champion and three-time Florida State uneven bar champion.  She finished third in the All-Around competition at the Florida State Meet.
<P>"We feel that Kristi is one of the finest uneven bar workers in the country and will certainly vie for All-America honors on that event during her time at Auburn," Thompson said.
<P>Paschal, a Level 10 gymnast at North Florida Gymnastics Academy under Mary Purvis, was a member of the 1999 Region 8 National Team and was the All-Around Champion at the 1999 Lightning City Invitational.  Paschal's parents, Jack ('76) and Elaine ('74) Paschal, are both Auburn graduates and her grandparents live in Opelika.
<P>"Lael has competed and excelled at the National Level," Thompson said.  "The entire staff and team wanted Lael to come to Auburn, not only because she is going to be an incredible vaulter, but because of her genuine love for the University.  Lael is a true Auburn Woman."
<P>The Auburn gymnastics team opens the 2000 season at Minnesota Jan. 8.  The Tigers' first home meet is against Alabama Jan. 30 at 2 pm in Beard-Eaves-Memorial Coliseum.
