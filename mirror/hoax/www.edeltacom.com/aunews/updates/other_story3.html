Auburn Adds Shuttle, RV Parking, Tent Area For Football Saturdays

<!--STORY-->
<tr><td>

<P><B>AUBURN</b>-  Auburn University is initiating several improvements - including gameday shuttle-bus service to and from Jordan-Hare Stadium - to its traffic and parking plans for the remainder of the 2000 football season beginning with the Louisiana State game on Sept. 16. 
Auburn University has also added parking for recreational vehicles, charter buses and a "green space" intended solely for tents, says Jim Ferguson, vice president for administrative services. 

<P>"The main reason that we're implementing these improvements is to try and provide a more orderly approach to traffic and parking on gamedays here at Auburn," said Ferguson. "We hope the changes we've made will add to the enjoyment and safety of the gameday experience for our fans and the fans from visiting universities." 

<P>The highlight of the improvements is the operation of a free gameday shuttle-bus service in collaboration with Colonial Mall Auburn-Opelika
and Groome Transportation Inc., which runs Tiger Transit, AU's transit system.  Tiger Transit buses will run continuously for four hours before and two hours after each home game, picking up and dropping fans off at the mall parking lot immediately north of J.C. Penney, the AU Facilities Division parking lot on West Samford Avenue and on Biggio Drive between the Athletics Complex and Beard-Eaves-Memorial Coliseum. 

<P>"The shuttle-bus service is something we've considered for a while now," Ferguson said. "We hope that some of our fans will find it a
convenient and comfortable way to get to and from the game."  

<P>Fans with questions about the shuttle-bus service should call AU Transportation Services at 334/844-5937.  

<P>AU officials have also tried to address the increased demand for RV parking by designating a barricaded area of Biggio Drive between Donahue Drive and Samford Avenue and the old Max Morris Drill Field student C-zone parking lot west of the Nichols Center for RVs.  RVs may park in the new areas by permit only for a fee of $20 per game or $100 for the season. Once permitted, RVs may access the areas beginning at 4 p.m. on Friday prior to Saturday home games. Under the same terms and conditions, charter buses may park in the old Max Morris Drill Field student C-zone parking lot.  

<P>Fans and charter-bus operators with questions concerning the new RV and charter bus parking areas may call the AU Athletics Department at
334/844-4442.  The new Max Morris Drill Field student C-zone parking lot southwest of AU Credit Union will be available to students and the general public free of charge on gameday. RVs and charter buses will be prohibited in that parking lot.  The green space on the Max Morris Drill Field will be closed to all vehicles and used for tents only. Tents with stakes 12 inches or longer will require a permit, which may be obtained through the AU Facilities Division at 334/844-9572.
