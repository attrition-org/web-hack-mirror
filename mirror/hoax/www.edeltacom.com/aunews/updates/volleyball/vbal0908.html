<p><b>COLLINS, Col.</b>-  The 3-0 Auburn Tigers traveled to Ft. Collins, Colorado this weekend for the University Park Holiday Inn Classic Tournament.  The Tigers took on the Lady Rams of Colorado State tonight in their first match of the tournament this weekend.  Jumping out to a decisive early lead of 6-0 in the first game, the Tigers were unable to maintain that momentum as the Lady Rams defeated Auburn 3-0 for the match.
<P>Auburn Head Coach Kevin Renshler says, "I inherited a team that needed to establish an identity really quickly.  I think this match proved that we have a lot of heart.  We tried to stay as balanced as possible.  By coming to CSU, we understand what it takes to be a top ten team and not be satisfied with mediocre play.  My job is to point the compass.  They need to row the boat."
<P>The Tigers began their fourth match of the season by taking an early 6-1 lead in the first game over the Colorado State Rams.  However, the Lady Rams battled back, bringing the score to a 7-7 tie.  With the score 14-9, Auburn fought to keep Colorado State from taking the game point, but were unable to, losing the first game by a score of 15-10.  Jaunelle Hamilton led the Tigers in kills, with six for the game, while Traci Price led in assists, with five.
<P>Auburn entered the second game of the match focusing intently on taking their first game win of the night.  The Lady Rams jumped ahead in the early start, and remain there, but with a hard fight from the Tigers, who came within one point of the Rams lead with a score of 13-12.  However, with the game point on the line at a score of 14-12, the Lady Rams took the second game win with a score of 15-12.  Tigers Jaunelle Hamilton and Brooke McCarley led Auburn in kills, Hamilton with eight and McCarley with seven.  Melanie Wille, in her first outing with the Tigers this season, had two kills for the Tigers.
<P>Entering the third game, the Tigers stepped up with an early lead of 3-0 over the Lady Rams.  Auburn fought to keep off the Rams for the remainder of the game, but ultimately lost out as Colorado State came away with the game win of 15-8 for the match victory.  The Tigers ended the match with total team blocks of seven to the Lady Rams 12.  Jaunelle Hamilton and Brooke McCarley both had nine kills for the match, and Traci Price had 23 total assists.
<P>The Tigers' next match is against California-Santa Barbara tomorrow afternoon at 12 pm.  This will be their second match in the University Park/Holiday Inn Classic.
