<p><b>AUBURN</b>- Kevin Renshler has been named head volleyball coach at Auburn University, according to an announcement today by Athletic Director David Housel.  Renshler replaces Kris Grunwald who resigned in March to pursue other interests.
<P>"The hiring of Kevin should be considered a clear indication that Auburn intends to win championships in volleyball," Housel said. "He has proven that he has the ability to build programs and compete at the highest level."
<P>Renshler, 36, has served as a head coach for seven seasons and has rebuilt two programs.  For the last three seasons, he coached at Northwestern University and helped the Wildcats improve from 175th to a high ranking of 31st in the American Volleyball Coaches Association/Sagarin power rankings.
<P>Prior to his three seasons at Northwestern, Renshler spent four years as head coach at Kent State.  In 1993, he took over a Kent program that had never had a winning conference record and led them to a 20-12 overall record and 10-7 Mid-American Conference mark four seasons later.
<P>Renshler's players have excelled in the classroom and for three straight years, his Northwestern teams posted a cumulative grade point average over 3.0.  In the last two seasons, he placed 15 of 16 eligible players on the Academic All-Big Ten Team.  In his final semester as head coach at Kent, Renshler's team combined to record a 3.44 grade point average- the highest GPA ever for a Kent team.
<P>"I am excited about the opportunity to coach at Auburn University," Renshler said. "Our goal is to be highly successful in the Southeastern Conference, on the national level and in the classroom.  I am looking forward to the challenge of continuing to build Auburn's volleyball program. We will strive for top results athletically and academically."
<P>Renshler spent one season as an assistant coach at the University of Florida.  In 1992, he helped lead the Gators to a 34-2 overall mark, and SEC regular season and tournament championship and a spot in the NCAA Final Four.
<P>Renshler earned his bachelor's of science in biological sciences from Ohio State in 1987.  He received a master's degree in exercise and health studies from Miami University.
