The Alabama Child Caring Foundation was established in the fall of 1987 to provide insurance coverage of primary and prevention health care services to uninsured school age children in Alabama.

<P><B>Why is the Caring Program Needed?</B>
<br>Thousands of Alabama's children are denied access to the health care they need because their parents cannot afford medical coverage.  These families earn too much money for their children to qualify for government-assisted care, so the children go without needed medical attention.

<P>Since its inception, the Alabama Child Caring Foundation has given more than 30,000 of these children access to needed health care services.  Thousands of other children who qualify for public health care programs have been referred to these programs by the ACCF.

<P><B>Who is Eligible?</B>
<br>Any child who is an unmarried natural son or daughter, step-child, legally adopted child, or is under the legal guardianship of parents whose annual income is less than or equal to 150% of the federal poverty level is eligible.  The child cannot be eligible for governmental programs like Medicaid or be covered by private insurance.
<P>
<img src=../../graphics/misc/accf02.jpg border=1 width=200 height=136 align=right>

<P>All eligible children in the family must be enrolled in the Caring Program.  Residents of Alabama are eligible through age 18, provided those of school age remain full-time students through grade 12.



<P><B>The Kind of Care Provided</B>

<br>The Caring Program for Children provides primary and preventive health care services designed to meet the typical needs of children.  The benefit package contains a comprehensive range of outpatient services including periodic well-child physical examinations;  hospital outpatient care, including outpatient surgery and outpatient diagnostic lab;  and X-ray and pathology services.

<img src=../../graphics/misc/accf04.jpg border=0 width=144 height=168 align=right>

<P><b>Quality Care from the Health Care Community</b>

<br>Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama's network of over 8,000 Preferred Medical Doctors and Preferred Outpatient Facilities (including every major health facility in Alabama) provides care for the children in the Caring Program.

<P>This means all the children receive the highest quality health care available - with the same emphasis on superior health services that all Blue Cross members enjoy - at a reduced cost.  It also allows contributions and matching funds to be stretched beyond normal purchasing power so that as many children as possible can participate.

<P>Most participating physicians have waived normally required copayments.  Thanks to this special arrangement, each child can establish a relationship for ongoing care with a pediatrician or family physician of the family's choice.  This is an important aspect of health care that most of these children have never had.  In fact, 83% of Caring Program participants never visited a private physician before enrolling in the program.
<P>

<P><b>The Caring Company</b>

<br>Blus Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama established the Alabama Caring Program for Children because of the company's belief that every child deserves to grow up healthy.  The Alabama Child Caring Foundation, a non-profit, publicly supported foundation, is the funding mechanism for the Caring Program.

<P>Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama provides all administrative support for the foundation so that every dollar contributed goes directly to providing health care coverage for children.  Blue Cross also matches every contribution dollar-for-dollar.

<P><I>The Alabama Child Caring Foundation and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama are Independent Licensees of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.</I>
