Q:  First of all, you ROCK!!  My question is....who is your favorite mascot buddy at another school?

Shelly Maddox (River Edge, NJ)

</font></div><P><font face="arial, helvetica, sans serif" size=2 color="#000099">

A:  Aubie loves to see that he has fans ALL over!  Great question...of all of the mascots that I've met over all of my years, I would have to say my favorite is Smokey.  He is just a cool dog.  I know cats and dogs aren't supposed to get along (especially Auburn and Tennessee!!), but our
friendship outside of the game is what makes us get along so well.  During the week, the two of us enjoy chasing cars, tearing up newspapers and of course, Sleeping!  During a game Smokey and I put our friendship aside and try to pull our teams through.  Another cool mascot is Colonel Reb from Ole Miss.  That guy is Crazy! Thanks for your great question and your interest in the Aubie program!

Q: Since the Aubie mascot was invented how many people have worn the costume and were their any women?  


<BR><div align=right>

William Finley

</font></div><P><font face="arial, helvetica, sans serif" size=2 color="#000099">

A:  Thanks for the question William.  The Aubie mascot was first invented in 1979 by SGA Director of Spirit, James Lloyd.  Since then, 51 people have stepped up to the challenge of being Auburn's wildest spirit promoter.  Of the 51, only one woman has been a part of this elite fraternity, and she was an alternate back in 1980.  Thanks again for your interest in the Aubie program.

Q:  I see you dancing at the games all the time. Is it hard to dance with your
big feet? How big are your feet anyway? My cat's name is Aubie too.

A:  My feet are huge aren't they?  I'm always seeing how nice people's shoes are and how I would like to try them on just to see how they feel, but I never can seem to fit them on!!!! I acually measured my feet once, and they were about 17 inches long!!! pretty big huh?  But, to answer you question, no it's not hard to walk and dance.  I look at people all the time and wonder how they don't fall over because their feet are so small!  War Eagle!

Q:  I am a junior in high school and a varsity cheerleader.  I am a huge
Auburn fan and love watching you at the games.  I was just wondering
when cheerleading try-outs would be so I could see what they were like.
I plan to try-out my freshman year at Auburn.  I know you are associated
with the cheerleaders and I thought you may be able to help me out.

Ashley (McCalla, AL)

</font></div><P><font face="arial, helvetica, sans serif" size=2 color="#000099">

A:  Well, it is true that the cheerleaders are some of my best friends in
all of the world!  They are the greatest, and many people I'm sure would
love to be an AU cheerleader (cause then they could hang out with me
right?..just kidding!)  To answer your question Ashley, the tryouts are
April 3-5.  To find out more information and to see some great pictures
of the cheerleaders look at their web page at
<a href=http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/cheerleaders>www.auburn.edu/student_info/cheerleaders</a>.  Good luck and a big War Eagle out to cheerleaders everywhere!!!

Q:  Hi Aubie, my name is Bill and I am 7 years old.  My Dad, Mom and Grandfather graduated from Auburn.  I love the football games and have only missed about 6 home games since I was born.  I was wondering what is your favorite part of the games?  Thanks.




<BR><div align=right>

Bill Sides (Aiken, SC)

</font></div><P><font face="arial, helvetica, sans serif" size=2 color="#000099">

A:  Well, first of all, it is good to be back "online".  I had to take a little break over the holidays so that I could gear up for this new century!!! Many catnaps were had over the holiday season.  To answer your question Bill, It
is very hard for a cat like me to pick exactly which part I like about the games.  However, the feeling that makes me have chills down my spine is when I get to stand out in the middle of the endzone and listen to the
85,000+ sing the national anthem.  Then there is that moment right when everyone starts to cheer again, and it is such a change from being so quiet to so LOUD, that I can't help but get so excited I hardly know what to do
with myself!!! Thanks for all the questions, and keep em coming!!!!
<P>
War Eagle!

Q:  Where did the nickname Tigers come from? War Eagle!
 


<BR><div align=right>

Kody Blackwell (Pinckneyville, IL)

</font></div><P><font face="arial, helvetica, sans serif" size=2 color="#000099">

A:  The nickname tigers comes from a poem by Oliver Goldsmith, the same poem
that Auburn gets its name from.  The poem is called <i>Deserted Village</i>,
and the line about the tigers is:  "Where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey..."
You should check out the <a href=http://www.alumni.auburn.edu/trad/>traditions page</a> at Auburn's Website.  WAR EAGLE!!!!

Q:  What's up,WAR EAGLE!!!, GO TIGERS!!!!! Do you see any rivalry between
who represents the Auburn Tiger Spirit more, you or the eagle?  It seems
people say War Eagle a lot.  Why not Go Tigers!  It is a rare occasion
when a school is represented by two mascots.

 


<BR><div align=right>

Paul Hedgepath (Anniston, Ala.)

</font></div><P><font face="arial, helvetica, sans serif" size=2 color="#000099">

A:  There is no rivalry between me and Tiger.  I love that eagle.  You see
when people say "War Eagle" It's like a battle cry, and I don't get
jealous.  If I could talk, the first thing I'd say would be War Eagle. 
I guess some people get confused with Auburn being both the Tigers and
having the Eagle, but I just take it all in stride.  War Eagle!!!

Emily Harmon (Montgomery Al)

A:  Unfortunately, yes, I have gotten into a few fights with other mascots.
Now, I don't think that fighting is good at all, but when the entire
student section starts chanting "Aubie, Aubie, Aubie"  it is REALLY hard
to stay away from those pesky other mascots.  Besides, it's always funny
to make them look silly!!! War Eagle Emily!

A:  Although I do attend all of the Tigers' away football games, I find all sorts of creative ways to get there.  Sometimes I fly on my special Aubie plane, sometimes I get a ride with the cheerleaders which is also a lot of fun, and sometimes I have no idea how I get there...crazy!!!!   War Eagle!
