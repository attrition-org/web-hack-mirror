      <p>It appears my client log-on isn't working! I'm in the airport waiting 
        to board a plane and I really need to contact you folks...</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Hello, <br>
        I need a password. I was wondering where I go about registering?</p>

      <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
      <p>Please accept my resume for a position as Media Relations/Communications<br>
        Manager with e-com-con.</p>
      <p>While you may not have any relevant opportunities currently, I would<br>
        appreciate your keeping my resume on file should something come along.</p>
      <p>I should point out that I have worked onsite as the media relations point<br>
        person at Microsoft Canada for four and a half years which entails a major<br>
        portion of my six years of experience in hi-tech PR. Prior to that, I 
        was an<br>
        editor on several publications for more than four years.</p>
      <p>Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to your reply and 
        the<br>
        opportunity to discuss my abilities in person.</p>
      <p><br>
        Thank you for your consideration.</p>

      <p>Is Burt Lancaster on staff? </p>

      <p>I'm doing some reasearch on cutting edge processors for business school 
        and I bumped into your site <br>
        And while I was under the impression that an Octium might be developed 
        by Intel, I was stunned to find a reference to a zero-g car ... <br>
        Besides it violating several laws of physics, I can't escape the impression 
        that your site is a joke-site. <br>
        So unless you found a Star Trek tricorder some Enterprise crew left behind, 
        I'm curious to see how you expect to pull that one off !!! <br>
        Cheers, <br>

      <p>Who are you guys?</p>
      <hr>
      <p>But what the heck is this about?</p>
      <hr>
      <p>To whom it may concern. I'm interested in finding out more about this<br>
        position. With my background in giant media companies unable to find<br>
        direction on the internet, my ability to kiss up to whomever necessary 
        while<br>
        stabbing colleagues in the back, and my ninja-like collating skills, I 
        feel<br>
        I am an excellent candidate. And I can curse like a sailor in French. 
        I look<br>
        forward to hearing from you.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>To Whom it May concern:</p>
      <p>There have been a statistically significant number of twin births born 
        to<br>
        lower class white females in a small nearby town in Tennessee. In each 
        of<br>
        these births, one of the twins have died, under suspicious circumstances.</p>
      <p>I'm aware of a group, the First Church of Elvis, a fanatical cult devoted 
        to<br>
        memory of the late rock star. They have stolen the wart cut off Elvis<br>
        Presley in 1957 and preserved by his doctors. I believe they are<br>
        attempting to clone Presley. The deaths of these babies serve to recreate<br>
        the tragic loss of Elvis's twin brother Jesse.</p>
      <p>This is worth your further investigation. Please contact me for further<br>
        information.</p>

      <p>I can design antigrav systems. Let me work for you :)</p>
      <hr>
      <p>This is quite an impressive website. As a professional web designer, 
        I'm impressed by the level of detail you went into to create this spoof 
        website. Ain't It Cool News spilled the story about e-com-con and its 
        connection to the Lone Gunmen show yesterday. Eagerly awaiting its arrival.</p>
      <hr>
      <br>
      nice site, nearly had me. 
      <p>think the company party photo's gave it.</p>
      <p>keep up the good work.</p>

      Do you have any more information on the Anti Grav Car. Any estimated specs? 
      Drawings? Anything that would encourage placing an order? Price guess-estimate? 
      Requirements for user? Such as pilots license, etc.?<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      Hello, I'm interested to learn more about the highly esteemed Gizli<br>
      Dosyalar's Flying car prototype. Such as, how is it going to fit 10,000<br>
      cds in it? If E-Com-Con was truly all about speed. You would have put a<br>
      mp3 player in it with a 10,000 gigabyte memory hard drive. Also, that<br>
      could have a satellite hook up for endless music downloading. Forget<br>
      CDs, how primitive. You might as well say the new flying car is going to<br>
      have a 10,000 Record playing juke box built in the trunk. Also what kind<br>
      of anti gravity devices are you using to make it fly? How is it going to<br>
      be powered? I promise i'm not a spy. I know a cheep way to power it<br>
      endlessly. By using kilned white gold dust. I've mastered a way to<br>
      produce it in my underground laboratory. I've kept it secret for fear of<br>
      ridicule from the power hungry free mason oil companies.<br>
      I've many forward thinking ideas, much experience with cutting edge<br>
      technology, and many patents pending. Even some top secret government<br>
      inventions that i'm not at liberty to disclose at this time. I would<br>
      very much like to become a part of the E-Com-Con team. So hire me!<br>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <p>love your website! you should post correspondences with people who think 
        <br>
        it's a real company somewhere so we can all laugh at them.</p>

      <p>Dear Sir or Madam--</p>
      <p>I stumbled upon your website and read with much interest your highly 
        <br>
        accomplished list of products and products-in-development.</p>
      <p>I have a project of my I own I feel you might be interested in. I have 
        been <br>
        working for years on a device I call the Polydystomat, which converts 
        dream <br>
        images into 3 dimensional, gelatanous confections--known in today's parlance 
        <br>
        as &quot;gummi candy.&quot;</p>
      <p>Perhaps we can arrange a meeting to discuss the particulars of my astounding 
        <br>
        accomplishment. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

      <p>Hi,</p>
      <p>I'm looking for investment opportunities for my child's college<br>
        fund(around $ 25,000). If I wanted to invest all of it, where do I send<br>
        the money?</p>

      <p>Your web site is hilarious.<br>
        I work in the telecommunications industry, and I see<br>
        all these adds on TV from companies like cisco,<br>
        lucent/avaya, verizon/bell atlantic, williams, etc,<br>
        and I deal with these companies all day and they are<br>
        idoits. What your web site needs are pictures of<br>
        children in third world countries, with some caption<br>
        about some bull shit on how your technology will unite<br>
        the world. Biometric Detection Spheres? I can't even<br>
        get cell phone coverage at my desk.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>This has to be a lark? A little Christmas joke for Chris Carter? Or did 
        the creative minds at TXF and the LGM have a little too much egg nog? 
        <br>
        Great site, I just don't buy it!</p>

      <hr>

      <p>Ok so this is a fake website to coincide with The Lone Gunmen show which 
        is <br>
        coming next year right? So the names in the employees section, will they 
        be <br>
        featured in the show? What is the resume thing..can you get your name 
        on the <br>
        website or on the show by submitting? This is really a cool idea. <br>

      <p>Hello,</p>
      <p>A question and a comment.</p>
      <p>Question: Why does the Zero-Gravity Automobile Initiative have a 10,000 
        disc <br>
        CD changer? Do you know anyone that owns that many CDs? Besides, by 2005 
        <br>
        everyone will be using digital MP3s, just put one of your processors into 
        <br>
        the vehicle and store the songs on a hard drive.</p>
      <p>Comment: If this technology really exists, why are you not getting any 
        <br>
        press? Your company should be the headline story on any number of <br>
        technology television shows.</p>
      <p>By the way, just in case you are a real company, I have attached my resume. 
        <br>
        Your claims are quite fantastic.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Something perhaps that you could help me with. Your CEO, Daniel Pendrell, 
        <br>
        happens to be a special agent from the X-Files. Even more interesting, 
        <br>
        your child prodigy Gizli Dosyalar happens to translate literally to &quot;Secret 
        <br>
        Files&quot;. It is also the name of the X-Files television show that runs 
        in <br>
        Turkey.</p>
      <p>You've got me really curious... what's your story? You seem to have gone 
        <br>
        through a lot of trouble building that web site...</p>
      <p>map</p>
      <hr>
      <p>You have a very interesting website, and impressive products. Is your<br>
        company traded on any North American stock exchange. If so, what exchange,<br>
        and what is your symbol.</p>

        <br>
        you'll be sifting through in March......</p>
      <p> This tie-in is much more bankable than the &quot;Blair Witch&quot; thing.....plus, 
        <br>
        I hope you all have much, much more success than the aforementioned &quot;Blair 
        <br>
        Witch&quot;.</p>
      <p> Good luck, and nice work!</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Hi !!! I know who you are, i've reconize the name of Susane Modeski!! 
        It's very clever to do that, i think you want to do the same thing than 
        The blair witch project but i think that not a good film, with a reputation 
        of xfiles, you can make the spin off name lone gummen with no pub!!! <br>
        Bye <br>

      <p>I would like additional information for your Octium IV Processor.</p>
      <p>Additonally I will require a client name and password so I could access<br>
        you site.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>Your site was limited to the information about the Octium Chip and the 
        XOS.<br>
        I'm definately interested in them both. What hardware does the XOS run 
        on<br>
        and how much is it?</p>
      <p>I've been trying out different OS's for the PC (i.e linux and BEOS). 
        None<br>
        that I wholeheartedly like so far. I truly would like to check out your 
        OS.</p>

      <p>I do market research on corp web sites. Kudos. This is better than some 
        of the sites owned by the consulting firms themselves. (Though I wouldn't 
        have menitoned anything about 10Q filings for a pre IPO firm...)</p>
      <hr>
      <p>I was told that this is a promotional site for the new series &quot;The 
        Lone<br>
        Gunmen&quot;. If it's not, I'm sorry, but if it is, then this is great. 
        I<br>
        can't wait for the show to air. I'm a huge fan of &quot;The X Files&quot;, 
        and the<br>
        Lone Gunmen. This website is cool, and good luck with the show.</p>

        position of Executive Assistant to Gizli Dosyalar in your Paris<br>
        (Sattelite) office. You should know that my previous jobs have given me<br>
        access to very sensitive information (including , but not limited to,<br>
        personnel files and other documentation) and so I have learned the art<br>
        of discretion. You should know that I am extremely enthusiastic and love<br>

      <hr>
      <p>I found your site at the HAVEN and though I find it cute I would like 
        to <br>
        understand it better. Are the references to promote the new Lone Gunman 
        show <br>
        or the Xfiles? I hope you get a lot of email and good luck with whatever 
        this <br>

      Hey I just wanted to let you know that I think e-com-con needs a new<br>
      branch office in Geneva, Iowa. Much of the midwest is under-represented 
      in<br>
      the e-commerce world. You may be asking yourself how can I help your<br>
      company. Well let me please take a moment of your time to explain. I have<br>
      seen the pictures of your office party for the launch of e-com-con and I<br>
      feel that I have the necessary dance skills and party attitude to be a<br>
      leader at your company. I can forward you the necessary resume and<br>
      background material so you can integrate me into your company as quickly<br>
      as possible. I would like my title to be Director of Party Coordination.<br>

      <hr>
      <p>hey does your site have anything to do with x-files??? because suzanne 
        <br>
        modeski and daniel pendrell are characters on the x-files!!!! what is 
        going <br>
        on??? </p>
      <hr>
      <p>i love the X-Files references... Pendrell....Suzanne Modeski.... <br>
        I think many of us have already figured out the E-com *con* lol I hope 
        this <br>
        is the Lone Gunman Series precursor that all of us X-Philes think it is. 
        :) <br>
        Take care</p>

        me <br>

      <p>Just wondering... what is your website about and for? Is this actually 
        a<br>
        real company, or some kind of XFiles/Lonegunmen spoof type thing. I'm<br>
        getting such a kick out of all of the references in there, such as Pendrell,<br>
        Modeski and Ishimaru. Great work!!</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Is it true that the Octium IV is keeping tabs on<br>
        people over the Internet?<br>

      <p>Dear web site owner, <br>
        I just came across your web site whilst surfing the internet and decided 
        to take a venture. Whist browsing your page I noticed something quite 
        uncanny with your company employees' names. They seem to have the same 
        names as characters that have appeared on the television show &quot;The 
        X Files&quot;in past years. For example Suzanne Modeski, Daniel Pendrell 
        and Dr Zama Ishimaru. They also bare a striking physical resemblance to 
        these characters also. What I'm wanting to ask is this. Is this web site 
        some kind of promotion for the new X Files spinoff series &quot;The Lonegunmen&quot;? 
        An answer would be greatly appreciated. <br>
        Thank You</p>
      <hr>
      <p>I was inquiring about your job openings. If at all possible, could I 
        be sent <br>
        an application? </p>

      <p>We are most interested in your revolutionary ductless<br>
        cooling systems. We would request by return of mail<br>
        more information on their specifications and terms and<br>
        conditions. </p>
      <p>FYI, I was directed to this site by my assistant, John<br>
        Houndett (two t's). He would like to me to pass on the<br>
        information, that if you receive any correspondence<br>
        from one F.Mulder, to please forward said<br>
        correspondence to us, (where this does not violate<br>
        federal privacy laws), as he is no longer connected<br>
        with our association, until February at least.</p>

      <p>Your site is perhaps the most sublime, entertaining, and well constructed<br>
        parody I have ever seen. Parody? Commentary? I'm not sure about word<br>
        choice, but I'd like to order an Octium processor if possible. I'm<br>
        currently a test subject in the beta trials of the Biometric Detection<br>
        Spheres, so you can draw funds directly from my account (as long as I 
        stay<br>
        away from microwaves today). My version of PINE supports Biometric<br>
        Verification, and I have fingerprinted myself between the following<br>
        brackets [ ]</p>

      <br>
      Pendrell, Ishimaru, Modeski... Watch X-Files, much? LOL Great website!! 
      <br>

      <hr>
      <p>Someone posted a link to your site on a message board... just had to 
        give<br>
        you my virtual applause. This is the greatest thing I've come across in<br>
        quite awhile. Thanks for the laugh!! I definitely appreciate all the work<br>
        that went into it!</p>
      <hr>
      <p>I want the other actress who plays Suzanne Modeski! She has the charisma!</p>

      <p>To whom it may concern at E-Com-Con.com:<br>
        I stopped by your site on the advice of a fellow E-Group member, and we 
        are very confused as to your company's mission. The striking similarities 
        between it and the television show &quot;The X-Files&quot; are suprising, 
        and we wondered if you are an actual company or merely an additional site 
        to support the reality concept of the Lone Gunmen spinoff show. Clarification 
        on this point would be greatly appreciated. Thanks and have a great day. 
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>Very cool. Hope the show does well.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Hello,</p>
      <p>Who are you people, and what is your connection with 1013 Productions?</p>

      <p>Dear e-com-con,</p>
      <p>I have just returned from your interesting site and I'm impressed. In 
        fact, <br>
        you could color me impressed if there was an actual color called<br>
        &quot;impressed&quot; (Maybe that could be your next project! Why should 
        Crayola <br>
        create all the colors?) Anyhoo, I'm a man in search for work and I want 
        to <br>
        work for you! I want to be part of a company that is building a hovercar! 
        To <br>
        quote the young and foolish, that's very &quot;kewl&quot;!</p>
      <p>I really don't believe in resumes. They are againist my religion so to 
        <br>
        speak. Let me instead tell you about myself. My given name is Oscar Blotnik, 
        <br>
        but I go by the name &quot;Blotto&quot;. It's my stage name. I'm a circus 
        fat man. <br>
        Actually I was a circus fat man until the bigtop bosses turned nazi on 
        me <br>
        and fired my large heinie. I won't go into the details, but it wasn't 
        my <br>
        fault! Sometimes tragedies happen. There's nothing you can do about it 
        <br>
        except pick up the experimental cotton candy and go on. Did I learn my 
        <br>
        lesson? Sure, I did. Elephant ears and poodle meat just don't mix.</p>
      <p>Here'e my stats! I'm thirtysomething (Just like the sadly cancelled TV 
        show! <br>
        I wonder how Elliot and Nancy are doing?)and I weight between five hundred 
        <br>
        and six hundred pounds. I have brown hair and brown eyes. I can bleach 
        my <br>
        hair if you perfer chunky, blonde guys! I'm as healthy as a horse! (Don't 
        <br>
        believe my doctors!)I'm a good worker if the work is easy and simple. 
        I'm <br>
        good at sitting and watching television. I can drink beer pretty well. 
        I get <br>
        along with people pretty well. Especially with the babes. I'm a babe magnet, 
        <br>
        in fact. I'm sure that can come in handy with your company!</p>
      <p>I'll take whatever job you throw at me! I'm not choosy! I can start whenever 
        <br>
        you need me (And you do need me! Trust me on that one!) I will furnish 
        my <br>
        own coffee table and I would like an office near the john.(Bladder issues)</p>
      <p>I hope to hear from you soon!</p>
      <p>Blotto</p>
      <p>p.s. I have an idea about hoverpants. Interested?<br>
