<center><p>PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:</p></center>
<hr>

<P>What is the viewer of the Nightly News really getting?</P>

<P>News? Reality? </P>

<P>Or what a small group of top leaders and capitalists would very much
like the unsuspecting public to <I>believe</I> is reality?</P>

<P>To be ignorant is to be controlled.</P>

<P>Until the population has a clear understanding of the propaganda
devices utilized by the 'commissar class' as methods of control and can
see the 'emperor's new clothes' that masquerades as 'objective',
'impartial' and 'unbiased' news reporting for what it <I>really</I> is, we
are all enslaved.  </P>

<P>Until the information playing field is leveled and the average citizen
has access to the same information as, say, the Phillip-Morris company,
this is not, a truly free society.</P>

<BR>

<center><P><B>Knowledge is power.</B></P></center>

<I>
"A country cannot be both ignorant and free..."<BR>

<CENTER>Thomas Jefferson   <BR> </CENTER></I>
							
<P>If Jefferson were alive today he would doubtless be shocked by the
blandness and uniformity of the popular media.   No longer the impartial
Fourth Estate of government envisioned by our founding fathers, the media
has turned its back on independent journalism and instead opts for
transcribing the opinions of the ruling-class elites.  When information is
framed and filtered through think-tanks, pundits, pollsters, and 'resident
experts' like Henry Kissinger, Pat Robertson and noted liar  Oliver North,
the population is being subjected to nothing more than insidious
propaganda disguised as news. </P>

<P>In recent years, reports furnished by the World Bank, the Club of Rome,
and even avowedly conservative think-tanks like the Rand Corporation have
predicted that at the current rate of fossil-fuel consumption,
de-forestation of the Wetlands, depletion of the ozone layer, rising
levels of greenhouse gases, population overgrowth, ruptures in the food
chain, etc., <B>the planet can sustain human life for another fifty
years,</B> <EM>at best,</EM> without an unprecedented shift in the way we
currently do business.</P>

<P>Big business does <EM><B>not</B></EM> want you to know that. </P>

<P>It might be bad for the bottom line.</P>

<P>There is a war going on, an all out, total <B><EM>information
war</EM></B> that is being waged right now against every man, woman and
child on the planet. We are subject to disinformation campaigns at every
turn, from every pollster, statistician, pundit, talking head expert, you
name it... we are being lied to so the rich can get richer at the expense
of Mother Nature and the very futures of our children and grandchildren.
</P>

<P>What the hell do they care about your kids? </P>

<P>Their families will be able to afford the finest, purest oxygen bottled
at a special source in the Swiss Alps.</P>

<B><P>This is a very critical moment in the history of the human
race.</P></B>

<P>R. Buckminster Fuller predicted that capitalism would only achieve
harmony with the environment when it became profitable to do so.</P>

<B><P>Information is the commodity of the future...</P></B>

<P>If there are enough informed people, armed with the significant
intellectual ammunition necessary to combat the distortion, innuendo, and
<I>cunning semantic subterfuge</I>  of the popular media, a paradigm shift
can occur in this culture and we may be able to pull back from the brink
of political and environmental catastrophe, <EM>before it is too
late.</EM></P>

<P>As philosopher Terence McKenna has remarked "This is not a dress
rehearsal for the Apocalypse...this is the real thing folks."</P>

<P>And even Ronald Reagan said something to the effect that if hostile
alien invaders attacked Earth, we would all band together, unite for the
common good and realize that we are brothers under the skin. </P>

<P>A pretty profound thought from the Gipper, huh? </P>

<P>And guess what...the Earth <EM><B>is</B></EM> being attacked, by
multi-national oligarchies and capitalist greedheads.</P>

<P>When fewer than 20 corporations own most media outlets there is a need
for an 'information antidote' to counter the reality engineers of the
corporate media.</P>

<P>The media dominates our lives and it sets our societal agendas. </P>

<P>It programs you, manipulates you and limits debate. </P>

<P>Whoever controls what you see, controls what you think. </P>

<P>While you're watching sitcoms, greedy bastards are busy destroying the
planet for a profit. </P>

<P><B>Information dissemination is the <EM>only</EM> way to change
anything. </B></P>

<P>Desperate times call for desperate measures...</P>

<P>The Internet is a revolutionary means of communication that can
decentralize power by providing everyone with a voice.  The Internet is
the medium of global information exchange and is the only place for truly
free information exchange, as it is not co ntrolled by any one
organization or media cartel. </P>

<P>You have the right to remain stupid...</P>

<P>Or you can storm the reality studio. </P>

<P>Good luck.</P>
