  Indonesian archipelago, between Southeast Asia and Australia in the vicinity of the South Pacific.<BR>

The Indonesian invasion
</FONT>
  <P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="1">
  East Timor has been the scene of a major and tragic conflict since Indonesia invaded it in 1975,
  maintaining to this day it's illegal presence in the territory, arrogantly desrespecting
  United Nations Security Council Resolutions deploring the invasion
  and ordering the immediate retreat of the Indonesian military forces.<BR>
  Also the International Court of Justice pertinent recommendations were ignored by Indonesia.

Human rights violations
</FONT>
  <P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="1">
  The armed forces of the large Indonesian Republic maintain a war of genocidal proportions
  in a futile attempt to crush the resistance of most sectors of the approximately 700 000 East Timorese.<BR>
  Massive human rights violations have caused the death of over one third of the population.<BR>
  With a severe birth control program and by forcing the transmigration of people provenient from other
  islands in the Indonesian archipelago, the genocide, both physical and cultural, is outrageous.<BR>
  In 1975 Indonesia planned to invade East Timor in 24 hours, 22 years have passed since then.

Dili Massacre
</FONT>
  <P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="1">
November 12th 1991 will be remembered forever by the East Timorese as one of the bloodiest days in their History. Two hundred seventy one unarmed East
Timorese civilians (mostly young people) where brutally killed by the Indonesian Army while staging a peaceful demonstration in Dili's cemetery of Santa Cruz
Three hundred eighty two wounded were counted. Two hundred and fifty more people just "disappeared". In the following days the massacre continued in
many places of East Timor, as the demonstrators were persecuted all over the territory. Inside the Army Hospital, in Dili, for example, many survivors were also
reported to have been brutally killed with heavy stones and lethal injections.
