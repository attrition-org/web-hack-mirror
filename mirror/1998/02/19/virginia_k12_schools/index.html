<p align="center">The following is quoted from the 1990 &quot;New

York's Teacher of the Year&quot; acceptance speech by John Taylor

Gatto. </p>



<p><font color="#000000">____</font>&quot;We live in a time of

great social crisis. Our children rank at the bottom of nineteen

industrial nations in reading, writing and arithmetic. The

world's narcotic economy is based upon our own consumption of

this commodity. If we didn't buy so many powdered dreams, the

business would collapse-schools are an important outlet for this.

Our teenage suicide rate is the highest in the world-and suicidal

kids are rich kids for the most part, not the poor.&quot; </p>



<p><font color="#000000">____</font>&quot;Our school crisis is a

reflection of this greater social crisis. We seem to have lost

our identity. Children and old people are penned up and locked

away from the business of the world without precedent; nobody

talks to them anymore. Without children and old people mixing in

daily life, a community has no future and no past; only a

continuous present. In fact the name &quot;community&quot; hardly

applies to the way we interact with each other. We live in

networks, not communities and everyone I know is lonely because

of that. In some strange way, a school is a major actor in this

tragedy; just as it is a major actor in the widening gulf among

social classes&quot; </p>

    <p>After delivering the completed version of this speech Mr.

    Gatto then resigned his position as an educator in the New

    York State Public Education System. If you care about

    anything discussed here, or want to read more, <a

    read the entire speech</a>. I feel that Mr. Gatto has an

    important message that needs to be heard. </p>

<p>The Tech Voodoo Crew (who is not affiliated with this hack)

brought this speech to my attention; I am simply carrying on the

message. Finally, greetings to all those who have inspired me,

and to all those whom I respect, you know who you are.</p>
