To the sysadm of this machine: fix your security. 
<P>Let's take a look at your old page: 'See what NASA are saying'...that's good, 
NASA buys SCO products too. SCO can't even secure servers running on SCO 
OpenServer, which is made by themselves. 
<P>The sysadm obviously thought that by disabling telnet he/she rendered the 
machine immune to outside attack...I think not. 
<P>To the clueless sysadm: When an attacker gains access to your machine through 
other means, he/she can start in.telnetd. 
<P>SCO makes server applications for NASA and government as well as large 
corporations...just think about how insecure THEY are.
