<b>We are here to Protect And Serve!</b><br>
(the interest's of Soeharto and his circle, that is!)<br>
Our Mission is: To 'calm' (meaning: sticks and tear gas) the masses when they feel they need to express
grievances toward The Government, To torture the leaders (and maybe sexually
enjoy them if the happen to be women - or, actually, doesn't matter). We
also like to make money off of unsuspecting traffic user, and from basically
any civilian, we catch them students who like to go on streets and insult our beloved president,
mainly in big cities, while in the smaller and more remote area (Timor Timur,
Irian Jaya, Aceh, etc) we don't usually catch them. We just shoot 'em! Fun, eh?
We also accept all kind of bribery, especially from them sly businessmen
who do business in Indonesia. Yeah, we protect them so that they can
continue sucking the blood of Indonesian people. As for drugs, we persecute
them all small pimps. That way our Boss "Tommy" Suharto will always have
the monopoly on drugs. Heheheh, furthermore,
since this Internet thingie is becoming the next big thing, we also
got this new unit called <a href="http://www.polri.mil.id/berita/cyber.html">CyberPolice</a>, and we would like to catch them Hackers so they don't
vandalize the homepages of Suharto's dictatorial institution no more ...
yeah, that ones from them damn Portuguese wuz pretty embarassing, and our asses
are still hurting since the last attack. Damn Toxyn and UrbanKaos!

In 1966, during the political and economy crisis that gripped Indonesia,
students all over the country came down to the streets and demanded
reformation from the government. And now, 32 years later, history is
repeating itself. Call this media-whoring, call this Indonesian Computer
Vandals Against Indonesian Tyranny, call this subversive propaganda, we
don't care. 

These attacks are a call for attention toward the struggle of Indonesian
people, oppressed for so long by Suharto's dictatorial rulership. And now
our economy is in the brink of collapse, due to the uncontrollable greed
of profiteering gluttons and political power-holders alike; the lack of
government transparency and the murder of democracy; and the widespread
violations of the original hope and goal of freedom. Look at all these
people who take the money Indonesia owe from the international community
to finance their private business: Siti "Kentut" Rukmana, Bambang
"Bangsat" Trihatmodjo, Hutomo "Anjing" Mandalaputra, Sudwikatmono,
Probosutedjo, Liem Soe Liong, Bob Hasan - all relatives and/or close
friends of Suharto.

Must we, the people, who have been placed as objects all these times, now
be made to bear the burden created by those who have enjoyed preferred
treatment? For the international community who are now trying to rescue
Indonesia: Are you going to let your help funds being used to cover the
financial crisis created by speculative, selfish, and greedy corporates?
Are you going to let your aid be managed by a government that is not
transparent, undemocratic and corrupted? Is it fair that now the low and
middle class of Indonesia, are bearing the burden of this crisis, which is
a result of only a handful government-supported enterpreneurs who take
advantage of credits loaned by other countries, to be used for their
individual interests?

The Suharto regime has responded to calls for reformation from political
activists by unjust, violent manner.  This has got to end. We are tired of
having our rights taken, our voices muted, our minds deceived. We are fed
up with all the promises, all the deceptions, and all the opression. We
are angry witnessing our sisters and brothers tortured, our leaders
imprisoned, our people impoverished, and our dream for democracy crushed.

So many of us went to the streets, protesting, demonstrating, fighting 
against the injustice done by our own government. Some of us went to prison, 
some of us went to the morgue, but we still won't give up.  We have long
lost our rights to free speech, and are sorry that we have to takeover
computer systems to get our messages, no matter how risky this is.

"Make my words a crime, I will shout out louder.
 Silence my voice, I will find another.
 Make my voice a crime, I will create a new one.
 Hunt me down, I will find a new place to hide.
 Lock me up, Ten will rise in my place.
 You cannot silence me.
 You cannot stop me.
 Me and my kind,
 We are forever ..."

We DID NOT destroy any server. Original pages were renamed. Index pages,
history files and logs were altered in order for us to survive.
Hackers-affiliated organisations and sysadmins of the systems involved are
not to be held responsible. We are just like other demonstrants on the
streets, who just happen to have the ability to gain access to these
sites. You might try to restrict information, but technology enables us to
stand as equals!
