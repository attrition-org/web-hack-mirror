Hacked By: The No|d Crew</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Its started back up now like a fire storm from
hell. The Noid Crew has sat and waited and its now time for the
second coming. You see the hacking of pages has become lame.
People are all to much into the &quot;owned&quot; &quot;fear
me&quot; bullshit. Give a voice to your hack. Make a damn
difference. No one gives a fuck if you own. That makes you a punk
wannabe like the rest. Give meaning to your hack. Find your voice
and use it. Speak out against whatever it is you disagree with.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">The Noid Crew speaks out now against the
political leaders that say their country has freedom. That is
bullshit in almost every country we know. The United States has
to be the biggest bill of shit ever made up. Our country was
founded for freedom. People gave there lives to break away from
Britain and anyone that suppressed them. We have diminished from
what we started off as. We are no longer the land of the free. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Why is it that a hacker gets more jail time
then a rapist? Why in the fuck is it that a 15 year old kid who
hacks someone's web page. Doesn't cause any damage what so ever
and he gets fucked over worse then a rapist? How in the hell can
this be? We would love to know this.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">How is it possible that the government of the
United States can get away with cases like Bernie S. and Kevin
Mitnick. How and why does this happen? The hackers fight daily to
prevent things like the Kevin Mitnick and Bernie S. stories to
happen again. What about you? What about the non-hackers the
commoners where is your voice to speak out against the injustice
set forth by the United States government. What about you Mr.
Bill Clinton your the main reason behind a lot of the new
&quot;anti-technology laws.&quot; Noid Crew would like to hear
what is being done about cases like Kevin Mitnicks and Bernie
S's. Why wont you step up to the plate Clinton and see what is
really going on.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Most of us in the Noid Crew are not even 18. We
are simply kids. We see something happening and it wont just stop
with the hackers. You non-hackers should be interesting in what's
going on. It starts with one group and people don't care then
another group and people don't care because they aren't the
hacker or cracker etc... and then they come for your group and
there is no voices left so start now find your voice and use it.
Talk hard for Christ's sake damnit.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Does anybody see us? Does anybody hear us?
Where scream out the same as before. Everyone cant be right but
everyone will decide. Where not afraid of the choice we've made.
We wont lay down as you mark our grave. Now sure you must have
seen us. You must have heard it all. Does anybody care at all?</font></p>
