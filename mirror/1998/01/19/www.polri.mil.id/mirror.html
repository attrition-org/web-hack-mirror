In 1966, during the political and economy crisis that gripped Indonesia,
students all over the country came down to the streets and demanded
reformation from the government. And now, 32 years later, history is
repeating itself. Call this media-whoring, call this Indonesian Computer
Vandals Against Indonesian Tyranny, call this subversive propaganda, we
don't care. 

These attacks are a call for attention toward the struggle of Indonesian
people, oppressed for so long by Suharto's dictatorial rulership. And now
our economy is in the brink of collapse, due to the uncontrollable greed
of profiteering gluttons and political power-holders alike; the lack of
government transparency and the murder of democracy; and the widespread
violations of the original hope and goal of freedom. Look at all these
people who take the money Indonesia owe from the international community
to finance their private business: Siti "Kentut" Rukmana, Bambang
"Bangsat" Trihatmodjo, Hutomo "Anjing" Mandalaputra, Sudwikatmono,
Probosutedjo, Liem Soe Liong, Bob Hasan - all relatives and/or close
friends of Suharto.

Must we, the people, who have been placed as objects all these times, now
be made to bear the burden created by those who have enjoyed preferred
treatment? For the international community who are now trying to rescue
Indonesia: Are you going to let your help funds being used to cover the
financial crisis created by speculative, selfish, and greedy corporates?
Are you going to let your aid be managed by a government that is not
transparent, undemocratic and corrupted? Is it fair that now the low and
middle class of Indonesia, are bearing the burden of this crisis, which is
a result of only a handful government-supported enterpreneurs who take
advantage of credits loaned by other countries, to be used for their
individual interests?

The Suharto regime has responded to calls for reformation from political
activists by unjust, violent manner.  This has got to end. We are tired of
having our rights taken, our voices muted, our minds deceived. We are fed
up with all the promises, all the deceptions, and all the opression. We
are angry witnessing our sisters and brothers tortured, our leaders
imprisoned, our people impoverished, and our dream for democracy crushed.

So many of us went to the streets, protesting, demonstrating, fighting 
against the injustice done by our own government. Some of us went to
prison, 
some of us went to the morgue, but we still won't give up.  We have long
lost our rights to free speech, and are sorry that we have to takeover
computer systems to get our messages, no matter how risky this is.

"Make my words a crime, I will shout out louder.
 Silence my voice, I will find another.
 Make my voice a crime, I will create a new one.
 Hunt me down, I will find a new place to hide.
 Lock me up, Ten will rise in my place.
 You cannot silence me.
 You cannot stop me.
 Me and my kind,
 We are forever ..."
