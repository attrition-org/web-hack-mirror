<blockquote>
How many of you consider yourselves "taiwanese?"
 The people whom I've encountered that consider themselves "taiwanese" are basically anti-China. They proclaim themselves ethnically taiwanese, and in no way consider themselves chinese. They denounce China, boycott China, or whatever else they feel promo
tes their so-called "taiwanese" ethnicity. All this because the government of China is communist, or maybe because they speak a different dialect? Because of a few people, or a differnet dialect ( note the word dialect, meaning that the chinese language i
s still the root structure ) they're willing to denounce their heritage and attempt to take on a different identity. The multitude of China is the people, and they are the ones who make up the country, not a few communists. Although you may not agree with
 the government of China, you cannot deny the people of China. Your ancestors are chinese, which according to linear descent, make you chinese. If this description fits you, all I ask is that you please open your mind.
