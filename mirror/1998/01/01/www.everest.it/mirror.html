When will it strike people that innocent animals suffering at the hands of unethical men and women are wrong? Since when has it been ok to take a life or torture a living being for selfish motives? Animals have nerves and so they are capable of feeling pa
in. With pain, brings suffering. Man tortures the weak beings around him and puts their lives at stake for his own materialistically selfish wants...
<p>If you will, imagine yourself without tear ducts. Now imagine a new application being tested for irritation. Imagine this untested application being applied *directly to your eye*, and having your eyes taped over so that you are unable to blink the irr
itant out. You're also held in a container so that you can't move either. Don't forget you don't have any tear ducts, so you can't wash away the hurt. This is real, and it happens to innocent rabbits who have done no harm but are raised only to suffer. To
 suffer for what you might want to smear on your eye lashes.
<p>This brings us to the issue of animal research. In animal research, animals have absolutely no say about what dangerous chemicals or viruses are injected into their body, what parts of their bodies are mutilated, etc. Vivisection is the dissection of l
iving animals. The word literally means "to cut whilst living." Every single cut, every single stab, every little poke here and there are conducted on a LIVE BEING. The animals of course have no say in such activities. Unfortunatly, many people think that
 animal experiments are nessecary for the further progress of mankind. This is NOT the case. Species differentiation tells us that a human system differs from the system of a rat or a monkey. What may affect one species, may have no effect in a human body
. On the other hand, something that has no affect on a certain species, may be toxic to the human body. Companies that conduct tests of new products on animals could find that the products have no affect on a certain species, and deem it safe for human us
age. However, because human systems differ from that of other animals, this new product could in fact be toxic to the human body. In such a case, if a consumer was to file suit against the manufactor of the product, the manufactor could simply fall back o
n the fact that their experiments on certain animals showed the product to be harmless. Do you see the fallacy in all of this? All too often, experiments conducted on animals have been shown to be misleading, inaccurate, or unnessecary. NASA is one organi
zation that has often experienced great failure in their cruel animal research experiments...at the expense of American citizens' money. Are there other alternatives? The answer is by far, YES. Take this quote for example:
<p>
"Researchers have better methods at their disposal. These techniques include epidemiological studies,
clinical intervention trials, astute clinical observation aided by laboratory testing, human tissue and
cell cultures, autopsy studies, endoscopic examination and biopsy, as well as new imaging methods."
<p>Hunting. What kind of sick and twisted mind would be willing to murder an innocent animal? What sort of savagery drives a person to end an innocent life and then put on display various body parts of the dead animal? People gasp when history tells them 
of a society which guillotined people and displayed their severed heads on pikes. Why gasp, when this goes on in our own society every single day, much more than you and I are aware of?
<p>
Open your mind, and know the cruelty of man. What evil is it that lies in man which makes him abuse and torture the weak around him?
<p>
People today need to think more. Not just about what lies on the surface, but more overly about what lies *below* the surface. If we would only take the time to think about ethics, moral issues, what is truly right and wrong...if man would look inside him
self rather than glance at the surface of life.
