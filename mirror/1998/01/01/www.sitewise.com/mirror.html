<blockquote>
Boom: Another one sets off and the ones around him pay the price. It's happened a few times
now, kids going off and ending the lives of others in a blind rage. When will it all end? When
people start to care. Why are there so many kids who are messed up today? Is it their
environment? Is it the media? Is it the sadistically insane next door neighbor who runs a cult?
No. The root is the family. Confucious among many others realized that long ago. Children are
brought up and influenced by their families. The responsibility of raising a child solely belongs to
the parents. If the child grows up and turns out to be someone who goes postal, then whose fault
does it become? Not those 100,000 demons, not the hairy eyed kid who thinks he's satanic, and
definitly not the insanity. It's the parents. Take the time to care, and raise your kids right. It takes
a lot to do so in a world where right is wrong and wrong is right.

"Discipline your son, for in that there is hope;<br>
do not be a willing party to his death."

"He who robs his father and drives out his mother<br>
is a son who brings shame and disgrace."
<p>
"Even a child is known by his actions,<br>
by whether his conduct is pure and right."

On a side note: Racism must die. In case you haven't heard, recently,
three white men killed a black man by dragging him on the back
of their truck for two miles. Racism must die, surely the pen is mightier
than the sword.
