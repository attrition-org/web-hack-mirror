nothing was damaged, sold, or tampered with - except perhaps the egos of
the agencies involved. His nick is "Analyzer" not "Destroyer". While it
is true that what they did was 'illegal', is it not also true that their
activities showed flaws in these systems? Today in our educational systems
most (if not all public and private schools) have embraced computer technology
in an effort to 'move forward' and be competitive in this new age. Do the
innovators of this new philosophy really believe that one can place restrictions
on someone's inquisitiveness? And that is what I believe this is all really
about - inquisitiveness, not damage and destruction. On a final note I
must also say that I find Analyzer to possess qualities which have become
quite rare and valuable in today's society: honor, loyalty, and honesty.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>
