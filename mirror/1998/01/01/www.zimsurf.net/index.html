<blockquote>I have a few things I'd like to give my opinion on. First off, I'd like to address the morals of
America's society. What kind of country is it when young children take the lives of others in cold
blood? Why is it that we have teenagers (now children do it too) constantly killing one another?
A person died today. In fact, more than one person died today. More people will die tomorrow,
and the day after tomorrow...the next person could be anyone. Today's American society glorifies
violence and thirsts for blood. People are hungry for eye candy. The television, the movies, all
appeal to people with eye candy. If it's not blood then it's sex. How can the morality not decline?
Correctional programs, and jails will only do so much for the "criminal." Jails are capable of
isolating and outcasting individuals from society (another debatable issue), but don't always do
much to help the criminal. Correctional programs can help, but don't always work well. Then what
other solution is there? To answer that question, we have to look at the source of the
problem...the Family. Children are not always raised in good environments with loving parents.
Unfortunatly, some children are raised without love, and therefore without guidance. Without
guidance children lack direction. In having no direction, they are easily swayed by what they see
and hear. What do they see and hear in America today? Well, for the media, "bad news is good
news", and unfortunatly, the media has quite a powerful and persuasive voice. So children hear
of people solving their problems with violence, and taking matters into their own hands however
it suits them. And so, they take the direction they are presented with. I suggest *FOCUSING ON
THE FAMILY* (if for some strange reason you haven't already caught that). America needs to
raise its children in a loving and moral environment if it even wants a future.
<br><br>As for President Clinton, it seems to me that he does a lot of good for his country, and he
cares for the people he governs. So why then, are people wanting him to step down for
something he might have done in the past? He claims himself Catholic, so let God deal with it.
You people are willing to lose a good president over something unrelated to the governing of
your United States.
<br><br>Politicians act like children, and I find it sad.
