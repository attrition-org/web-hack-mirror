I've explored farand beyond.  I've ventured on, and on.My tracks have been covered by the wind, and redirected as a decoy to those who wish to go where I have been. I've calledout, but my calls have went as wimpers'no one cares to see a dream differedI've left my place in life in serach ofsomething new something I share with only those who have a clue.  Its the world of sensewere people do indeed understand A world withan inner bind that is blind to creed and colorof skin.  A place where anyone with a questfor knowledge or curiousity may enter in. A world where knowledge is not limated, and weare not scolded for the things we are to do, andhave already did.  A world where the expansion of knowledge is not a crime, and the gain of information is not a waste of time.  Away fromthe decitfulness of the real world is where I willremain along the loaths of the things I love isnow where I reign...<p><centeR>                              written by-optiklenz-</center><br>=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<pre>                                                                                 "Knowledge is never a crime"  _|_|        _|_|_|        _|_|_|_|_|      _|_|_|      _|    _|  _|    _|      _|    _|          _|            _|        _|  _|    _|    _|      _|_|_|            _|            _|        _|_|      _|    _|      _|                _|            _|        _|  _|      _|_|        _|                _|          _|_|_|      _|    _|                                                                                                                                      _|            _|_|_|_|      _|      _|      _|_|_|_|_|  _|            _|            _|_|    _|            _|    _|            _|_|_|        _|  _|  _|          _|      _|            _|            _|    _|_|        _|        _|_|_|_|      _|_|_|_|      _|      _|      _|_|_|_|_|                                                                                                                  </pre></table>
