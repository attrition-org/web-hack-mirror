<tt><font color=CC0000 size=4>Hello, in case you didn't notice, this site was ha
cked, if you want to go to
original site please click <a href=index1.html>here</a>.  However, if you
have a minute, please hear what I have to say.

<p>
<font color=ffffff>I am here to tell you a sad story of a person named Kevin
Mittnick.  Before
you classify me as another juvenile vandal with too much time on his hands,
please, just read through this.
<p>
<font color=ffff00>Kevin Mittnick is, or was, a hacker.  There are many 
deffinitions of this word laying around, and none of them are good.  
Somehow, they all manage to slip words like criminal, vandal, and anarchist, 
through the ears of the reader.  I honestlly dissagree with that. 
Hackers don't vandalize or destroy anything.  Take me for example, I could 
have sent this server crashing down in a spirale, or I could have deleted 
every bit of info up to military specs.  But I didn't do any of that, because 
<i>I am a hacker</i>.  Well, Back to the point, Kevin was a hacker.
<p>
<font color=CC0000>Kevin got caught.  He confessed to some of the things he was 
charged with,
so the feds locked him up.  They put him in prison. They put him in a very
speciall prison. They put him in what is refered to as a <i>maximum security</i>
 
prison.  He's been there for two years already, still WAITING for his trial. 
He was refused bail.  
<p>
<font color=ffffff>Is it right to take someone as inteligent and harmless as 
Kevin, and put him among the killers, rapists, and other scum of that sort?  Is 
it right to put
anybody in such place without a trial?  Is it right to refuse somebody's
bail with no speciffied reason?  I, for once don't think so.  It scares me
to realize that things like that can go on, and be publically known about,
and nobody's doing anything about it.  
<p>
<font color=ffff00>Well, by now, you must be wondering what the purpose of prese
nting this
might be.  The purpose is to present this information, for this has not been
made public.  Sure, the media around the world reported on Kevin's capture,
but that was about it.  People have the power, or so it's supposed to be in
this country, and people visiting this site are those of high position and
financial status.  So please, take a secound of your time, do something,
anything, to prevent this from happening.  It doesn't have to be much, even
if it's printing a copy of this in your company newsletter, or making this
available someplace, or even sending a pack of cigarettes to Kevin, it would
really mean alot to us.  The hacker community thanks you
for your attention.
<p>

<font color=CC0000>P.S: dear admin, my sincere appologies for any inconveniece t
his break-in
has caused.  I assure you that your system is intact, and fully functional. 
Nothing has been added or removed. However, I did take the librety of adding
some extra security in order to prevent attack from some true vandal. 
Consider it a gift, peace.
<p>
PPS: if I lived in California, I'd apply for a job as security consultant in
your company, you really did some interesting stuff.  I was really impressed
with your cooperation with VISA. Keep up the good work. ;)
