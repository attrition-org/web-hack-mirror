For Example, our classes are infested with        decade old equipment when they should be provided with        state of the art technology including Internet        connection. I feel it is only just, since our tax dollars        are part of the reason your district is even able to        function. I believe the school district should be more        involved with the students instead of letting time take        its course. Once again, I should point out that we should        be receiving nothing less then the best technology,        because we are the future leaders of this nation. I also        feel we should understand and be familiar on the        standards in today&#146;s society, and again, we are        getting less then what should be given. We are being        deprived of exultation, we are being mocked with higher        expectations yet you are not providing the motivation,        nor the facilities we need to accomplish what we should        have been able to accomplish years ago. What we are to        accomplish tomorrow we are accomplishing weeks from that        time, and what was supposed to be accomplished today is        now a bliss in the sky, and because of what? I&#146;ll        let you answer that question... </font></p>        <p><font face="Arial">In today&#146;s society        communication is a necessity. One form of communication        widely used throughout the world is the Internet. Kids        attending school today are our future leaders and need        the skills necessary to survive the real world. It is        very important that they get exposed to technology of        today and tomorrow. Currently LAUSD offers free Internet        access, discretely. All students should be notified that        they are allowed to have free access to the Internet        through the school. It is also necessary that the        hardware and software of the school&#146;s server be        upgraded not only the server which handles Internet        connections, but also the file server. WAIT There is        more...</font></p>        <p><font face="Arial">Now that I have covered your lack        of technology and interest in doing anything about it, I        think I will move on to curriculum (or lack thereof).        When I was in school, we were taught the same old thing        over and over again for example long division you taught        and I knew, but you had to over-do it buy giving us 1000        problems of the same thing. &quot;Urmm Teacher I already        did this problem is just had different numbers&quot;.        That is why school is boring to most people. Most people        who should be overachievers are under achieving because        of that lack of interest. You have the stats, I guess you        could see that for yourselves, but you won&#146;t see the        problem because you really don&#146;t care about people        who actually attend your crack house facility&#146;s. You        keep telling yourselves students are dropping out because        of &quot;Drugs&quot; &quot;family problems&quot;        &quot;etc&quot;, well that is not the matter for most        cases. The reason is it BORES us. Why not just give a        student one problem, and see if he could do it and if he        cant then realize there is something wrong with the way        you taught him. Then, make sure he knows it and it is        clear to him before shoving a 1000 more problems in his        face.</font></p>        <p align="center"><font size="5" face="Arial">THE        CONSCIENCE OF A HACKER</font></p>        <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Another one got caught today,        it&#146;s all over the papers. &quot;Teenager Arrested in        Computer Crime Scandal&quot;, &quot;Hacker Arrested after        Bank Tampering&quot;...</font></p>        <p><font face="Arial">Damn kids.
