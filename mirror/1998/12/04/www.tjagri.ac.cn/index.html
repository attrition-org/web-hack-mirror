<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Yes we have returned, again taking
over another important system in less time then it took us to bounce from
server to server to cover our tracks to get to it. The "Tianjin Network of 
Information of Science & Technology" a site run by the Chinese Government is what 
this site was. It dictates what can be seen and heard by a countless number of people 
in China. It makes up the rules and regulations on how and when it censors 
it's ownpeople and when what they say and think are in violation of the law.
</FONT></CENTER>
<br>
<Br>
<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">A place where information is freely
discussed is a place where people can form their own opinions. The Chinese
government wants to censor their own people and shield them from outside
sources of information. The more information people, the more choices they
have, the more choices they have, the more freedom they have. This is why
the decrepit old men who run China now wish to limit the information the
Chinese people see, because they want their people to have only one choice,
the one they are given, therefore taking away their freedom. Information
is neither good or evil, it is what we do with it that gives it it's power.</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">A few days ago <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/16485.html">a
story ran about a man, Lin Hai, who was arrested in China and faces LIFE
in a Chinese prison</A>. What did he do, kill another man? Rape? Steal?
Treason? No, he is accused of sending e-mails to a dissident publication
ran in the USA, some of which criticize the present Chinese leadership.
Life in prison. The Chinese government is scared to death of the Internet
and the ease anyone can access information, and the ease it's people, like
Lin Hai, can communicate with the outside world and how they can now express
what they think.</FONT></CENTER>
<br>
<Br>
<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">This censorship, which is being aided
by a US company, SUN Microsystems, who is providing 90% of the computer
systems used in China for it's Internet services, is still growing. They
set up SUN firewalls to block sites that people inside China might want
to see which freely disperse information, such as ordinary online news
papers and search engines.</FONT></CENTER>
<br>
<br>
<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">So in addition to this site being
defaced, several Chinese firewalls have also been breached and have been
misconfigured to allow anyone passing through it <B>FREE ACCESS </B>to
any site they wish. I leave it up to the Chinese to find which and fix
them, but in the meantime, I hope some of Chinas citizens enjoy the freedom
to see what the want, and say what they want to say.</FONT></CENTER>
<br>
<br>
<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">I am not asking for anyone to do anything,
but to rather do nothing. Do nothing to support the government who now
sits in Beijing. Do not support their most favored trading status, no not
support their economy by buying items that, we now know, are made my slave
labor in prisons, and do not support the companies who are supporting and
dealing with this government as well.</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Most people do not know who Kevin
Mitnick is outside of the underground circles, the law professionals dealing
with the case and money hungry reporters. He has been in jail for over
3 years without a trial. He has been held longer then people who rape,
steal and assault others. He did nothing violent, he didn't carry a gun
or make</FONT></CENTER>
<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">death&nbsp; threats against anyone.
He was a 'hacker'. Support his cause against an outrages unjust prosecution.
Help him at least get his right to a FAIR trial by his peers, and not get
rail roaded by a system that wants to use him as an example.</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">I know to the delight of the Chinese,
this will be the last time I take a trip across cyberspace to their land.
It will be the last time I connect to their systems for any reason. For
those who were opposed to my last penetration saying I was censoring the
censors, I say it's their turn. Besides they only spew disinformation and lies
in any case.
