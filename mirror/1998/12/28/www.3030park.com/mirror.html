<FONT SIZE=7>HI-TECH HATE</FONT><BR>
<H2>Hacked by inS and |NIN|</h2>

<b>Everything that you believe to be true is a contradiction.  Imagine a
world
that
is suffering a slow decay, and a culture on the edge of extinction.  A
world in
chaos brought to
obedient order by the machines that man created.  The linear programming
that the
system machine
created to bring order is failing steadily due to the one variable the
machines
cannot
compute...humanity.<p>

Watchful and aware, constrain every movement,
admit the consequences, freedom's an illusion.
Where is security governed through scrutiny?
Your privacy denied, organized and confined!<p>

"All must abide and all must adhere"
Future oppression becoming more clear.
This is a warning so you must take heed,
this coming vision is reality<p>

<blink>WE ARE SORRY. YOU ARE NOW EXPERIENCING PITCH
SEGREGATION BY INTERAURAL PHASE DUE TO MOMENTARY
AMPLITUDE DISPARITY. PLEASE STAND BY.</blink> <p>

Our world is on the verge of a temporal displacement, and it will be
humanity that falls victim to the repercussions.<p>

Hi-Tech Hate is: inS |NIN| problem<p>
