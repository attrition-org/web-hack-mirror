<p align="center"><font size="5">Kiddy &quot;Hacker&quot; GAME OVER. THE SO CALLED PENTAGON HACKERS AND THE GOVERNMENTS ULTIERIOR MOTIVES HAVE BEEN EXPOSED. THE TRUTH IS A VIRUS IS IT NOT?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080" size="4">This will
probably come off as No|d having a big ego but, take it as you
may.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#808080" size="4">Things in quotes
are from a </font><a

color="#808080" size="4">wired magazine article</font></a><font

<p align="center"><font color="#808080" size="3">&quot;The two
California teenagers who roamed through unclassified military Web
servers in recent weeks used a widely known and easily patched
server security hole. &quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Today's so
called hacker... does nothing more then sit for hours trying the
same exploit over and over on many different servers and yes
after a while you will get in.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080" size="3">&quot;Don't you
think the government ought to be listening to its own security
organization?&quot; Jasper asked. &quot;Why didn't the Pentagon
apply these patches?&quot; </font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">The government
doesn't have time really to patch all of their servers so they
don't. Unless they are servers that hold classified information.
Also, its not really the pentagon that was supposedly hacked.
Most of the servers that were statd'd were army servers but, I
guess you can call that pentagon also.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080">&quot;The statd exploit,
a version of which dates back as far as 1996, allows a malicious
user to gain root access - or top-level administrator access - on
a target Unix machine running Sun Microsystems' Solaris operating
system.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">The statd exploit was out
way before 1996. The g!mps at CERT just had not heard about it.
Just like they think nlock doesn't work.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080">&quot;Jasper said that
the two teenagers in Cloverdale, California, who go by the
aliases TooShort and Makaveli, used statd to gain root access to
military servers. Then they created new accounts for themselves
on those systems.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">We have 2 kids without
lives. Probably not to many friends at school etc... They go to
school for 6 hours a day just trying to stay awake during class
because they stayed up late the night before. School is over...
they go home and start &quot;hacking.&quot; They open their list
of .mil sites and begin trying to statd each of them.<br>
statd </font><a href="http://www.usmc.mil"><font color="#FFFFFF">www.usmc.mil</font></a><font
color="#FFFFFF"> <br>
Exploit failed.<br>
statd server1.af.mil<br>
Exploit failed.<br>
statd station9.nasa.gov<br>
Root Access Gained.<br>
This isn't an actual log of what statd looks like... but you
basically get the point. Any retard could go through 200 servers
and yes eventually one will be statd able. O but wait! They have
a mentor that taught them to type in 2 words to gain access to a
system. Shall we meet the retard the FBI cant find but no|d
tracked down in one night.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080">&quot;Under the guidance
of their mentor, an 18-year-old named Analyzer, the pair used
these backdoors to install password sniffers, which silently
record the keystrokes - and passwords - of other users. The
youths then reportedly used those passwords to obtain access to
other systems.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">O here we go... their
mentor! He had 2 kids sit and statd hundreds of servers for him.
Shit that's kinda smart actually making someone else do all the
retarded work for you and then once they statd'd a server for him
they would install sniffers! A sniffer! that's might elite lets
tell the world we've hacked them and are watching everything they
do.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080">&quot;But while the three
were sniffing, Jasper and federal agents were sniffing right
back.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Our point exactly.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080">&quot;That monitoring
continued until the warrants were served on the youths on 25
February, at which point the data was turned over as evidence.
&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">The 2 wannabe hackers
were being watched by the FBI. That shows some real talent there!
To have the FBI watching you online and you don't even know. What
elite hackers! <br>
Stupid Kids.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080">&quot;Jasper said that he
has captured 1.3 gigabytes worth of the cracker team's network
activity, and that he and authorities are in the process of
sifting through the evidence. &quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">God damn that's a lot of
statding eh?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080">&quot;Analyzer did a lot
of tutoring with TooShort and Makaveli,&quot; said Jasper.
&quot;I have some ... chat sessions where he is teaching
[Makaveli] how to modify DNS [Domain name servers] and set up
bogus host names.&quot; </font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Wh00pie! They could make
funky DNS names to show people on irc and be elite! </font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080">On Tuesday, Analyzer told
Wired News he still had root access at more than 400 military
computer systems. Though the two teenagers had their equipment
confiscated by federal agents last week, Analyzer remains at
large. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Analyzer has got over 400
hacked military computer systems!?!? O my god! That means they
had to type statd 400 times. Jesus Christ that's a lot of
type.....<br>
Only 400? Geesh :-]</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">THE MEDIA SHOULD
BE ASHAMED FOR PRINTING THEIR HYPED PENTAGON HACKER BULLSHIT. YOU
GUYS WERE REALLY DIGGING FOR SOME GOOD OL HACKER STORIES WEREN'T
YOU?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="4">Thank you to
wired magazine for that good enlightening article.</font></p>
