        &quot;Seybold Group Highlights Security as a Major Focus
        of Windows&nbsp;NT<br>
        In the September 1997 issue of Patricia Seybold's Open
        Information Systems, Michael A. Goulde applauds Microsoft
        for implementing a comprehensive security architecture
        for Microsoft® Windows&nbsp;NT® operating system.
        &quot;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Well.. the Patricia
        Seybold Group supposedly did some advanced research into
        NT 5 and its security architecture. We know NT 5 has a
        solid security framework because We deal with NT
        everyday. Seybold needs to worry about their Security and
        then worry about NT 5. We did not do anything spectacular
        to gain access to this server... a sloppy admin let us
        in, that's all.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">This site was not hacked
        to slam on the Seybold Group, their research looks
        interesting. This hack was done to heighten security
        awareness. We ask the forgiveness of the Seybold Group in
        advance. If this had been a true 'intruder' more of your
        network would have been compromised. Your Admin needs to
        be flogged though ;). </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>[This is also
        acting as Proof of the Interviews with AntiOnline and
        Hacked.net.]</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">As with any No|d hack.. we
        will give a political message:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3"><em>The Education System
        in this country needs to be re-vamped. Educational books
        go to the lowest bidder. Demand more of your Country.</em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Before we go:</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3"><em>You need to visit the </em></font><a
        href="http://207.98.195.250"><font size="3"><em>Rhino9</em></font></a><font
        size="3"><em> website and the </em></font><a
        href="http://www.technotronic.com"><font size="3"><em>Technotronic</em></font></a><font
        size="3"><em> website. Learn about the holes we used to
        get in. Standard security training is nothing.</em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">We would like to say 3
        things to the entire computing community.. mainly the
        security one.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">1) A *well* configured NT
        system is more secure than most Unix systems we
        encounter. Unix is not religion.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">2) Do not slam or hammer
        Bill Gates. Gates was a brilliant hacker in his youth.
        You are being prejudiced by jealousy. He has money, you
        don't. Live with it.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">3) Microsoft's business
        practices should not be viewed as criminal. They should
        be studied. Not since the birth of this nation has such
        an aggressive attitude been taken. Live with their
        success and stop being a baby.</font></p>
