<p align="center"><font color="#808080" size="4">Its been a while
since the media has been able to over glorify petty hackings.
Everyone's been talking about the &quot;pentagon hackers&quot;
like its something new. The pentagon and many government sites
are exploited every day. The part No|d and many other hackers
find funny is the media's choice to cover the &quot;recent
hackings.&quot; right around the same time Janet Reno is asking
Congress for a few million dollars to start a new government task
force to hunt down illegal hacking and phone activities. Two or
so mediocre &quot;hackers&quot; are suppose to have hacked
hundreds of pentagon sites. No|d has talked with the hackers.
They first told us how much they fear and respect us and then
told us the different types of attacks on systems they have
launched. For those of you in the security community the so
called pentagon hackers are using nothing more advanced then the
statd technique. That is how most kids are today. Get a list of
around 200 sites and sit and try the same exploit to every one of
them. Number play on their side. Your going to get one out of 100
sites eventually.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080" size="4">This is not the
first time nor the last time the pentagon was supposedly hacked.<br>
This by far has to be the most pathetic media coverage though.<br>
Antionline is the big stink though. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080" size="4">When they say
pentagon hackings... they don't mean actually pentagon computers
per se.. but servers ending in .mil, the military classification.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080" size="4">This is gona be
the medias first hack during this pentagon game that they can
show to the public. For the record: We did NOT take any software
from this server or any other servers that the U.S. Army
Information Systems Software Center headquarters runs Nor was
anything on this server harmed and further more the hole that was
used to get in was fixed. They should be paying us for all the
fixed servers : ^ )</font></p>

futile when not properly setup.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#808080" size="4">Yipee.... looks
like we just put the hack into the &quot;pentagon hackings.&quot;</font></p>

PLANET!&quot;</font><font color="#808080" size="5"><br>
