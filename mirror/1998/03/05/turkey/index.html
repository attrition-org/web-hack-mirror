<P>&nbsp;<BR>CYPRUS, an independent country, was invaded by Turkey in 1974. Two hundred
 thousand Cypriots of Greek and Maronite descent were forced out of their homes in
 northern Cyprus and became refugees in the south. Many thousands were killed, injured
 or raped. Large numbers of illegal settlers were brought in from mainland Turkey
 and most Cypriots of Turkish descent were forced into exile.<BR>
<P>Occupied northern Cyprus has a puppet government controlled by Turkey and protected
 by 40,000 Turkish soldiers. As specified by many International Agencies (eg. Amnesty
 International), Turkey has one of the worst records on Human Rights violations in
 the world.<BR>
<P>Numerous<A HREF="http://www.ucy.ac.cy/pzaphiri/cib/Condemnation.html"> United Nations Resolutions</A> calling
 for the immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops and the return of all refugees to
 their homes have been blatantly ignored by Turkey. Meanwhile, the plight of the 
Cypriot people goes on. No refugee has ever been allowed back in occupied northern
 Cyprus. When they try to go back they are brutally <A HREF="http://www.ucy.ac.cy/pzaphiri/cib/Current.html">attacked
 and murdered</A> by the Turkish Occupation Forces.<BR>
<P><B>We ask you kindly not to visit occupied northern Cyprus</B> and thus financially,
 morally and politically provide support for the illegal and barbaric occupation 
of our homelands. Thank you for your understanding and we wish you a pleasant stay
 in free Cyprus.<BR>
<P>NOTE: Visiting occupied northern Cyprus also constitutesa serious personal safety
 and health hazard. The following, for example, apply to occupied northern Cyprus.<BR>
<P>1)There are reports of endemic hydatid disease, brucellosis, rabies, salmonellosis
 and bacterial meningitis.<BR>
<P>2)The incidence of serious crime and road traffic accidents is very high.<BR>
<P>3) Medical facilities are of a very low standard.<BR>
