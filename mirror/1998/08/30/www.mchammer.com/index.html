WE STOP HACKING YOUR DUMB ASS.

<!-- Labeling us as such is not constructive.  If we find the time and     -->

SO T0NIGHT W3 WERE B0RED AGAIN (G0 F1GURE), AND LISTENING TO SOME
HIP HOP PARTY MUZAK, SO WE DECIDED TO HIT THE PINNACLE OF RAP.

THE H0R1Z0N...

<!-- 99% of rap music sucks.  It is not artistic, and not part of          -->
<!-- black history or culture.  Don't believe their hype/lies.             -->
<hr>

AS UZUAL, CAR0LYN M3INEL ASKED US TO HIT A MORE C0MM3RCIAL
S1T3, BUT SHE ASKED US NOT T0 M3NTION H3R NAME.  SO, BE QUI3T
AB0UT THAT, 1TZ 0UR SEKRET.

<!-- Truth be known, she is writing a chapter about us in her second       -->
<!-- book.  She has contacted HFG on numerous occasions asking us if       -->
<!-- we could show our 'hacking prowess' (her words) so that she may       -->
<!-- cover it exclusively in her book.  She offered us 10% of the          -->
<!-- book earnings and we agreed.  Since she doesn't know how to           -->
<!-- read these comments using her Internet Explorer, we are giving        -->
<!-- her a slap in the face.  Her goal all along has been to lead us       -->

HFG R4P FOR Y0U:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<!-- The 'c' in "rap" is silent.                                           -->

Jack,
Relax.
We're hackin' to the max.
No lame attacks
on your exec_stacks.
We're pitchin' flack
'cause yer security's slack.
Just the facts.
We kicked yer gluteous max.
It's a parallax,
you dig?

We move around,
the small gets big,
it's a rig.
It's action,
reaction,
r00tin' interaction.
So who's afraid
of our infractions?
Can't get no satisfaction
from the facts?
You better run, homeboy.
A hack's a hack
from Nome to Rome, boy.

What's the deal?
We spun the wheel,
'cause the dice were hot,
we took a shot.
We played your cards,
showed you what we got -
what we're holdin'
and when the cards are cold
we don't go foldin'.
Lady Luck is golden.
She favors the bold,
And we're COLD.
Stop throwin' stones
because we got the hackin' jones
so dig our hacker rap,
'cause babe, yer 0wned!
