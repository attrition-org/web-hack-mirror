Any and all <b>original*</B> submissions are considered and appreciated.
If we decide to publish your submission, you will know when the new
issue comes out.  If we decide your article sucks, you'll know
that too, because your article will <B>not</B> be in the next issue.  
However, if your submission is so incredibly awful that it rends
the very fabric of good taste, we will probably print it in 
linenoise and ridicule you.<P>

We will publish articles under any pen-name you want.<P>

Article submissions become the publication property of Phrack 
Magazine, but remain the intellectual property of their authors.  We
change nothing except maybe correct some grammar and spelling.  We 
censor nothing.  Either we will print your entire article, or none 
of it.  This Magazine is by the hacking community for the hacking 
community.  Period.<P>
