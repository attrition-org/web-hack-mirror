HFG PO3TRY FOR Y0U:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
wether you believe it or scoff
we at HFG hate john markoff
to the new writer matt
we say "at least you're not a rat"

for some reason john hates mitnick
even when tsutomu is the real big dick
while shimmy is no beginner to crime
kevin is the one doing his time

hanging here at new york times
is the best place to sling our rhymes
poor journalism these guys have the knack
which explains the good security they lack

we busted root on their women and their suns
next thing you know, we'll be looking for nuns
in our short absence we leave you this thought
at least the good fight was fought!
