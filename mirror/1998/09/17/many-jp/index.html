&quot;hacked&quot;</strong></font><font face="arial"></p>

<p><font face="arial">First off I'd like to apologize for the interruption. There are a
few issue's I would like to make clear to the country of Japan. Before I do this I'd like
to point out that no damage was done to any of the systems (as always). You are probably
wondering &quot;Why us?&quot; Well we have a friend of ours saying &quot;Why me?&quot; He
was a peaceful, and productive citizen of the San Fernando Valley until he too was
&quot;interrupted&quot; pulled out of his envoirment, and had everything he lived for
atomized, and torn apart before his eyes as if that weren't enough he was placed into a
maximum security prison at which he was surrounded by rapist, murders, and others of the
sort. He was tormented for his knowledge something no one should be ridiculed for. If we
sat otiose, and learned nothing we'd be ignorant, but if we lived to acclaim a knowledge
that is rightfully ours we are imprisoned in other words your dammed if you do, and your
dammed if you don't. Tsutomu Shimomura a inhabitant of your land was involved in the
capture, and incarceration of Kevin Mitnick for what? For a safer America? No, but only to
feed his ill rotten ego. He couldn't handle the fact that someone was better than him so
he decided revenge was the only way. Well along with his actions comes ramifications ones
that weigh heavily on not only him, but his people. He has thus far defined what I think
of people like him, and the people involved with him. He has ruined a life to put a smile
on his face, and even now he is not laughing. Tsutomu Shimomura if you see this or if one
of your relatives happens to wonder why your on every domain in Japan think to yourself
&quot;was it worthed?&quot; in your eyes it maybe so but in the eyes of many and many a
like it is not. ........<a href="http://www.kevinmitnick.com">Free Kevin Mitnick....</a> </font></p>

<p>A message to HFG, (HTTP://WWW.MOT.CO.JP what were you trying to prove?) </p>

<p>You you guys think your tough stuff because you've gotten ahold of a admmountd exploit,
and have been able to train your members to art of compiling exploits. Your hacks are weak
in manner, and presentation obviously lacking ethics, and the product of adolescent teens
who aren't able to obtain any &quot;pussy&quot; thus your &quot;hacking for girls&quot;
statement. Why not hack for purpose? Why not hack for the pursuit, and advancement of
technology? Hacking has not only to do with gaining &quot;root&quot;. Hacking is a
expansive applied knowledge in any technical field. Hacking is cutting down tree's, and
bumming code. Hacking is not the posting naked pics on sites, and messages of inarticulate
purpose. To say the least you got far more credit than you deserve... &quot;A &quot;true
hack&quot;, at the most sophisticated level, finds and exploits a security hole that was
previously unknown. It is, for hackers, a discovery of the first order. True hacks may
occur when a hacker understands how things work (or, often times, don't work) and takes
advantage of those flaws, oversights or errors in an original way. This level of hacking
requires intimate knowledge of computers, programs and computer languages. These hacks are
often discovered, reported and patched by hackers themselves. The real achievement is in
the process of discovery. &quot;</p>

<p>(HFG fall's under this category) Derivative hacks should be seen as nothing more than
joyrides. In most cases, hackers are not impressed: there's nothing inventive or
particularly clever about breaking into a system using tools that someone else created. It
is a bit like stealing an unlocked car with the keys in the ignition. btw: your not the
only gimps who can rhyme....</p>

<p>Eye of the Beholder</p>

<p>I have seen things most people don't' I have been places most people wont' I have born
witness to reality Although I live in a world farther then they will ever be. I've
explored far and beyond. I've ventured on, and on. My tracks have been covered by the
wind, and redirected as a decoy to those who wish to go where I have been. I've called
out, but my calls have went as whimpers' no one cares to see a dream differed I've left my
place in life in search of something new something I share with only those who have a
clue. Its the world of sense were people do indeed understand A world with an inner bind
that is blind to creed and color of skin. A place where anyone with a quest for knowledge
or curiosity may enter in. A world where knowledge is not limited, and we are not scolded
for the things we are to do, and have already done. A world where the expansion of
knowledge is not a crime, and the gain of information is not a waste of time. Away from
the deceitfulness of the real world is where I will remain along the loathes of the things
I love is now where I reign... </p>
