The great space program, JPL

We jumped on the system
and cored the bitch
because we got that GIRLIE ITCH!

Now don't you feel to for j00
Coz we will tell you what to do
First you can your wizkid boy
And scrap that bgrep TINKER TOY!

And next you call up H-F-G
and just cry out 'Oh mercy me'!
'Those 3v1l h4x0rz 0wn m4h 4zz'!
'I want to take your hacking class'!

We will come right out and fix you good.
just give us chix to lick our wood
Coz NASA it is very clear
