<p align="center">YES, THIS PAGE'S SECURITY HAS BEEN COMPROMIZED!</p>

<p>To all those who came here to visit the original site, our
apoligies, we have something important to say and this seems to
be the only way to get your attention.</p>

<p>Government and the media has told you many things about
hackers. You are supposed to think of us as bad people, with no
other intention than that to crash wallstreet and make your life
a living hell. Let me tell you, we are not like that at all. </p>

<p>We are the people who take care of the security on the
InterNet and other network-related platforms. Without us, many
bugs would never be discovered and be only knowledge of a chosen
few, who might to bad things with it. (Yes, malicious hackers DO
exist)</p>

<p>We are the people standing up and raising our voices for our
rights. Let's not forget these are YOUR rights too. We stand up
against major injustices done in the world today, we show the
courage to stand up against the government and no longer live
like trained animals. They don't like that, and that's why they
put up that image about us. They pick a bunch of lame hackers who
are a bad example (Analyzer, MoD, milw0rm, HFG) and tell you we
are ALL like that. <strong>NO WE ARENT#@&amp;!</strong><br>
Take a look at it. We are hackers, standing up for YOUR rights,
keeping the government from making YOU no more than zombies. If
you silence us, who will be left to protect you ?</p>

<p>We, hackers, don't have racial problems. As mentioned in a
text all hackers know, we live without skin, religion nor racial
differences. You [the government] wage wars, you murder people,
you steal, you lie to us and make us believe it's for our own
good, and still WE are the criminals. Well, take a clear look at
it... WHO is the criminal ? The hackers, defending you, or the
government, giving you a false feeling of protection ?</p>

<p>This site was hacked to bring this to your mind. We had no
intentions of trashing it, making it's owners lose money or
whatever else. Things just needed to be said.</p>

<p align="right"><font color="#C0C0C0">Greets go out to: <br>
No|d, Rhino9, Lords of the Underground, AntiOnline, Chameleon,
InterCore and all the others who have made my mind clear.</font></p>

<p align="right"><font color="#C0C0C0">No greets to:<br>
MoD, milw0rm, Analyzer, HFG, Ashtray Lumberjacks -- You give us
hackers the image of badmans.</font></p>

<p align="center">To end, let me quote him who taught us...<br>
<font color="#00FF00"><strong>TRUTH IS A VIRUS</strong></font><br>
Chameleon, we lub ya!</p>
