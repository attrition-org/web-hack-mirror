<p>
Nothing Records, after many weeks of begging and pleaing, have signed The Spice girls.
Several Long talks with them, and we have decided we can afford them. We agreed,
because of the quality of there music, to pay them just a small amount less than
what a drive thru-window person at McDonalds makes (which works out to be just a bit
more than a female would make doing phone tech support). We have decided that we
would add twiggy ramirez to the band, since he has nothing else to do, and generally
is just a gimp, and would match these britian whores.

If I were Jason Patterson, I would probally think of a better password to protect my site with.
If I were Trent Reznor, I would think of going back on tour asap, before someone hacks his toaster,
and it ends up frying him. Which would send millions of poser americans into a frantic rave. Probally
90% of the people that listen to nine inch nails, arent REAL fans, just little posers, that back in 89,
could of cared less about the band, because they were to in love with Michael Jackson.
