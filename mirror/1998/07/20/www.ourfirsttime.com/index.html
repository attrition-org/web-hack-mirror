<CENTER> <H1> HI...did you know the ourfirsttime.com stuff is all a HOAX? </H1> </CENTER>

<BR> <BR>

These scum simply wanted to capitalize on the media-doped people of our
country.  The media loves a contreversy don't they?  Well, now don't you
(yes, <b>YOU</B>) feel stupid now that you too were duped?

<BR> <BR>

There was never going to be any sex show...  On August 4 the couple was
going to decide to abstain AFTER all you perverts paid your entry fee
(yes, the site was going to be turned into a PAY SITE).  

Oh yeah, do a whois on ourfirsttime.com and see who "owns" the domain:

<br> <hr> <BR> "Oscar Wells"...does that ring any
bells?  Remember Orson Wells' (accidental) hoax 60 years ago with "War of
The Worlds"??  This sick scum, Oscar, wanted to make himself appear equal
to Orson's genius...  well, bud, it backfired..turn off the pornos, Oscar,
go read a book, and get a life.
