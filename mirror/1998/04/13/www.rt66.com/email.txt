In the past two years, I have lied about several things...  I would like to
make ammends by comming forth with the truth...  I need to right my wrongs.
I hope that you can all accept my sincerest appologies.

To all the beginning hackers:

        Im sorry I gave you enough shit to get yourself in trouble with,
you should have had nothing to do with me.  I know I was wrong & you
probably got into a lot of trouble because o*f me, I would be happy to
handle all of your legal affairs if you get caught because of my
information..  Tell your lawyers to ask me for money to help pay off your
costs.

To my internet provider, RT66.com:

        Im sorry I jeapordized your system.  I gave the hacker and computer
society in general the middle finger and you paid for it.  It's obvious
the hackers out there are far better than the security schmucks here.
To think...  someone bypassed their security...  tripwire...  and my
31337 chmods!  Ok... so when it got rm'd they rooted it with a bug
any four day old admin should have closed.

To the internet community:

        Hmm..  well...  what can I say?  You caught me in all of my lies.
Sometimes.... I feel as if turning back to Crack would be a good escape.

And lastly...  to Virginia...  my lovely daughter:

        I cant even start to explain how sorry I am for my second husbands
behavior.  Walking in on him masturbating in the living room must have been
traumatic....  As you know...  I have moved on to bigger (well, figuratively
speaking) and better things.
