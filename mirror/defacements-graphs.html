<b>Notes</b><br>
First read the main statistics <a href="stats.html#NOTES">notes</a> if
you haven't already.

<p>
The intent of this page is to illustrate overall trends in defacements
regardless of webserver or OS platform.  One aspect of that is that
we have more data, since we're not restricted to when we began collecting
OS and webserver data (August 1999), but restrict the time range from
January 1999 to the present.

<p>
I have done away with the histogram, which apparently caused more confusion
than clarity.  If someone is seriously interested in histograms of the data,
drop me a line, as I still produce them for internal usage.  I have replaced 
the histograms with a min/median/max graph that is probably more meaningful
to the average reader, and is easier to read in any event.
