      As previously announced on the
      <a href="/security/commentary/">defaced-commentary</a>
      list, Top Level Domain summary data for the years 1999-2000 is now updated.
      This is data that relates to TLDs only; find it <a href="tldlogs/">here</a>
      as well as the <a href="tldlogs/tldlogs.tar.gz">tar-ball</a> of the logs for
      the entire archive.
    </p>

    <p>
      The OS Tables <a href="os.html">page</a> is now up-to-date, and 
      should be on a daily basis.  It had been busted since at least late 
      summer.  Funny, I used to get email about those sorts of things.  I'm
      guessing that the usually up-to-date <a href="os-graphs.html">os-graphs</a> 
      have diverted traffic from it, which is too bad, since the tables 
      have a finer-grained OS definition (NT-Windows 2000, BSD, Linux
      distros, and the "Other" category broken down, for instance), 
      and not only that, you can use them for making your own graphs
      as well...

      <b>Subpoena Stats</b><br />
      Two 2703d Subpoenas has been delivered under seal. The first requested 
      information on two individuals. Apparently the FBI thought it
      easier than delivering two seperate subpoenas. The second was to obtain
      information on a single individual ('pimpshiz'). A third subpoena was
      delivered after the mirror was discontinued by the US Postal Service.

    <p>
      <b>NOTES</b>:
    </p>
    <p>
      It <b>SHOULD</b> go without saying that not all defacements are
      reported to Attrition, Attrition does not get every defacement
      that is reported to us, and that these statistics refer 
      <b>only</b> to our archive.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      All of the tallies, graphs, tables, and etc., count each
      <a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/notes.html#mass">
	"Mass Hack"</a> as one defacement unless otherwise stated.
    </p>

    <p>
      These statistics are prepared with a combination of Perl and a
      commercial statistics package, 
      <a href="http://www.stata.com">Stata</a>.  
      All graphics are from Stata.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Discrepancies: Yes.  The <a href="os.html">easiest</a> discrepancy
      to find is between total defacements and adding up the totals for
      each month.  On one hand, a total and accurate count of the entire
      archive is desired, on the other, when we do date-based calculations
      or tallies, we kick out incomplete dates.  Since we have a number of
      mirrors that don't have a complete date, the date-based calculations
      and the total count differ.  Most of the incomplete dates are from
      or before early 1999.
