<span class="note1">
Portfolio trackers can tell you the current value of your investments, but that’s about all.  GainsKeeper’s <I>service</I> starts where tracking software ends. GainsKeeper is the only portfolio tracking service that is backed by securities and taxation experts. GainsKeeper automatically adjusts your portfolio for wash sales trading activity, splits, mergers, spin-offs, and other messy corporate actions. Know your true cost basis (and gain/loss) at all times, 365 days a year! </span>

<U><P><span class="note1b">Important note on recording buys and sells</span></U></P>
<P><span class="note1">GainsKeeper performs complex calculations to adjust your holdings for wash sales, corporate actions and gain/loss calculations. For optimum performance, you should enter your buys and sells in trade date order, from oldest trade to the most recent. Do not worry if you accidentally enter a trade out of order. GainsKeeper’s &quot;as-of&quot; technology will compensate for this and recalculate your current status based on the new trade. However, because of the complexity of these calculations, your response time will be slower.
 GainsKeeper performance is best optimized when you enter your trades in order of execution.</span></P>

<P><span class="note1b">GK – A Different Solution</span></P>
<P><span class="note1">The more you use GainsTracker the more you’ll understand why this service is so valuable. 
 As a daily portfolio tracker you’ll know your market values, as you’d expect, 
 but you’ll also know your gains and losses. 
And, because GainsKeeper characterizes your gains and losses, 
you’ll see both short and long term figures. 
 Finally, you have complete control of your investments.</span></P>

<U><P><span class="note1b">Unique Service, Unique Procedures</span></P></U>
<P><span class="note1">Along the way you’ll probably find procedures a little
 different from what you’re used to with a regular portfolio tracker.</span></P>

<P><span class="intitleb">For instance:</span></P>

<UL>														
<LI class="note1"><span class="note1">Editing is done by deleting a lot and re-booking it.
  This may seem more complicated than simply editing the transaction,
   but it's necessary due to the "as of" technology we've built into the system.
  "As of" technology allows us to affect each lot for corporate actions back to January 1, 1999, regardless
   of when you enter your transaction into GainsKeeper.</span></LI></UL>

<UL>
<LI class="note1"><span class="note1">&quot;Original Buy&quot; versus &quot;Adjusted Holdings&quot;.
Your old portfolio tracker wasn’t smart enough to care about a correct cost basis – but we do!
If you’ve used another portfolio tracker you remember that it only requires a purchase date and price.  GainsKeeper requires an original purchase price, date and, if purchased prior to January 1, 1999, a Baseline Date.  The baseline date represents the last date you knew &amp; correctly adjusted your cost basis.
This is necessary so our system can determine whether you’ve already adjusted a lot for a specific corporate action.</span></LI></UL>

 <UL>
<LI class="note1"><span class="note1">Example 1 – Cost Basis Adjustments Prior to 1999.</span></LI></UL>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<P><span class="note1">If you bought 200 shares of Cisco on 5/1/98 for a total cost of $3,000.00,
you would have owned 300 shares of Cisco after the 9/16/98 3:2 split with
the same total cost.</span></P>

<P><span class="note1">Since GainsKeeper will adjust your positions for any corporate action
activity from 1/1/99 forward, it is imperative that you start with the
correct shares and cost for purchases made prior to 1/1/99. In this example you would enter your split adjusted
300 shares and $3,000 total cost, and 12/31/98 as your
"Baseline Date" to confirm that you have adjusted your holdings for
corporate actions occurring prior to 1/1/99.  GainsKeeper will then automatically adjust for any corporate action
affecting this position after 1/1/99.  In the case of Cisco, GainsKeeper
will automatically adjust for the 2:1 split occurring on 3/23/00.  You only
have to account for corporate actions occurring before 1/1/99.

<DIR>
<DIR>
<P><SPAN CLASS="NOTE1">You also have the option to enter positions that you have already adjusted
for corporate actions. For example, Cisco again split 2:1 on 3/23/00. If you
bought 200 shares of Cisco on 3/1/99, before the split, for a total cost of
$3,000.00, you may choose to enter your adjusted position, accounting for
the split.  In this case, you would enter 400 shares and a cost of $3,000,
using a baseline date of 3/23/00.  This will prevent GainsKeeper from
processing the 3/23/00 split against a position you have already adjusted.<br>
OR<br>
You can simply record the original 200 share purchase with a date of 3/1/99
and GainsKeeper will automatically adjust your position for any corporate
actions occurring after 3/1/99!</SPAN></P>
