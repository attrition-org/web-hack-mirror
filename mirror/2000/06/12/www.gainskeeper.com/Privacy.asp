GainsKeeper offers a service that is founded on a trusting relationship with its customers.  A private and safe GainsKeeper experience is our primary concern.  That is why each bit of information processed by GainsKeeper is encrypted, password protected and stored on secure servers.  GainsKeeper uses VeriSign's digital certificate and SSL technology to authenticate users and protect user entered information.  GainsKeeper recognizes it would not have a business if it didn't respect its users' privacy.  As always, we welcome any feedback you might have on how to provide a more reliable and trusting GainsKeeper experience.

During registration and account setup, we ask you to submit information such as your name, email address, zip code, brokerage names and account descriptions, and the type of 
Operating System your computer uses.  Also during registration, we ask you to share other personal information that 
is optional, such as your gender, birthdate, referral names and email addresses, interests and hobbies and investing 
experience, such as income and net-worth range. This information is <b>optional</b> and you can decline this exchange of information at any time.
This information will only be used internally by GainsKeeper's marketing
department for demographic studies on our users and their investing and tax filing practices for generating statistics on our user base. All optional and required information, including name, address, email, 
brokerage names, account descriptions, will not be sold or redistributed to a third party without your consent or request. 
Please note, if you should choose to withhold required information, GainsKeeper may not be able to provide you with 
some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information, such as personalized stock portfolio views 
and capital gain/loss reporting, or email notification of events in your portfolio.<br><br>

After registering with GainsKeeper, you qualify for a free evaluation period of 15 days. 
During this period you will have access to 
the full functionality of GainsKeeper's service. If you continue using the 
service after your evaluation period has expired, it will be requested that you enter 
a valid credit card and the accompanying billing information before logging in. In this case, your 
credit card will be billed the amount of $35, authorizing you to use 
GainsKeeper's service for one year starting on the date of your registration. 
The following year, GainsKeeper will again prompt you for billing information 
for the next year of service. Once again, you will have the option to cancel or 
continue using the service. <BR><BR>

If you do not choose to continue using GainsKeeper's service after the trial period has expired, simply press the 
"Cancel" button when prompted for billing information or email us at <A href="mailto:billing@gainskeeper.com">billing@gainskeeper.com</A>. 
In this case, GainsKeeper will permanently delete all information entered into the system within 30 days. 
Please note, your information will not be recoverable once the cancellation process is complete. <BR><BR>

In order to benefit from GainsKeeper's service, you will need to record and/or create personally identifiable 
information in the system.  This information includes your LoginID, Password, email address, the securities you buy 
or sell, when you purchased the securities and for how much.  Without this information, GainsKeeper would be unable 
to adjust your cost bases and generate Capital Gain/Loss Reports for portfolio analysis.  This information is 
necessary for GainsKeeper to provide its service, but GainsKeeper will not share any personally identifiable 
information with third parties, unless we have your explicit request and authorization.<br><br>

Other companies that place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their 
advertising or content through the use of cookies (using the same techniques as described above). 

Due to the way the 
Internet technically operates, we cannot control this collection of information - but we can control which companies 
are allowed to place such advertising on our site. GainsKeeper makes use of the Flycast service in order to provide 
banner advertisements. As a matter of policy GainsKeeper provides <b>no</b> mechanism for an advertiser to reach you or any other specific 
customer. At no time is your information used to determine what advertising you receive nor do we use it to determine what type of 
advertising any other customer of GainsKeeper will receive.  Flycast may collect information and operate under its own privacy and security policies which 
can be further evaluated at: <A href="http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html" target=_blank>http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html</A>.
As the consumer you should contact these advertisers or content providers that place information on GainsKeeper directly if you have any questions 
about their use of the information they potentially collect.

GainsKeeper uses the personal information we collect from you during registration to provide custom Capital Gain/Loss 
Reports with the user name and address in the report header for proper tax filing.  We also use personal information to 
do research on demographics, interests, and behavior. Our research is done to better understand and serve our users. 
For example, Gainskeeper uses investment information to determine what type of trading
activity the majority of our users undertake.  In general, if our users are trading more mutual funds than stocks we can
target future development efforts on services focused on mutual fund analysis.  A recent study of this kind has indicated 
that a large portion of our users would like short sale functionality and we have made development plans accordingly.  
This information and analysis is compiled only on an aggregated basis for general statistics.  
<br><br>
There are opportunities where individuals can opt-in to receive a premium service from GainsKeeper or one of our partners. Certain 
information will be shared with our partners so that they can provide the requested service.  Some examples of these opt-in premium services are:
&nbsp;&nbsp;1) If GainsKeeper partners with a brokerage or an advisory company to provide a GainsKeeper 
members with services, such as automatic data downloads or "next best trade" recommendations.  GainsKeeper memebers will opt to 
elect this type of premium service before any personally identifiable information is shared. Another example is our 
referral email feature. This allows current GainsKeeper members to send a customizable email in order notify 
associates of GainsKeeper's service. GainsKeeper does not use the email addresses entered in this feature for 
marketing purposes. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;2) A future opt-in service is the GK Alert service where members can choose to receive GK Alerts (customized pricing information or corporate
action alerts affecting your portfolio) sent directly to your pager, cell phone, email or PalmPilot.  This feature 
requires personally identifiable information, such as your pager number and paging service provider.  If you opt-in to use this service, you will first have
to agree to the terms and conditions of the service and thereby give GainsKeeper permission to send personal data to 
a third party such as your cellular or paging service provider.
For opt-in or user initiated requests such as these, GainsKeeper will only share personally identifiable information specific to 
providing the requested service. GainsKeeper will always provide links to third party privacy statements and it is 
our members' responsibility to evaluate their privacy and security policies.

GainsKeeper does occasionally send informational email to our customers - and we hope you never think of it as Spam. 
Since GainsKeeper can provide you with portfolio specific information such as splits, mergers, spin-offs, acquistions
and capital gain/loss calcuations, we intend these notices to be informative and better enable you to make smarter 
trading decisions and maximize the usefulness of the service. To ensure that this is the case, we have strong 
policies in place that allow our customers to control the delivery of this content, or to prevent it altogether if 
that is your preference. Every email sent to you will contain an Opt-Out link allowing you to unsubscribe from these 
types of GainsKeeper outbound emailings.  GainsKeeper does reserve the right to send a one-time registration 
confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to its customers to inform them of specific changes that 
may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in 
status. An example of a Service Alert message would be notification of the impending closing of an account that is 
believed to be abandoned.   Finally, we also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a 
legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of our Terms of Service. GainsKeeper is retaining these rights 
because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters 
which will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if 
you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications are rare.
