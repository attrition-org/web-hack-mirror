GainsKeeper's CEO, Duncan Routh, is advising GK users not to attempt to sell declining positions with the specific intention of realizing losses and buying back the same security at a lower cost.
<br><br>
&quot;Wash sale rules are one of the most widely misunderstood tax concepts affecting investors today&quot;, according to Routh.  &quot;For example, many investors who bought Microsoft (MSFT) in the $100's may be tempted to sell it in the $70's, realize a large loss for tax purposes, and then buy back the stock at a much lower cost basis.  However, the IRS wash sale rules require that a capital loss must be deferred if this type of maneuver is
used.&quot;
<br><br>
IRC Section 1091 states that if a 'substantially identical' security is purchased within 30 days, the loss can not be recognized until the new position is sold.  To make matters even more complicated, the 30-day measurement includes shares purchased on, prior to, or after the date of the realized loss, effectively creating a 61-day wash sale window.  Investors who fall into this trap must defer their losses until they dispose of the new position.

&quot;GainsKeeper has subscribed to CBS MarketWatch's BigCharts service to
provide its members with the best stock charts on the Internet. The charting
functionality will now allow GainsKeeper members to chart a company's stock
performance against its earnings, dividends, splits or the S&P 500, DJIA and
NASDAQ Indices. Charts can be created for time frames of 1-day out to
1-decade. It's just one of many small steps GainsKeeper is taking to make
'smart investing' easier for the individual investor.&quot;
