Technology made trading easy, but it did nothing for the mundane task of keeping records of those trades - 
until the introduction of GainsKeeper.  The response from investors continues to be overwhelming!

<img src="images/new.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I cannot believe how good this site is for people that have stock or mutual fund holdings.  I listed my stock holdings and was very satisfied.  I recently added my mutual fund portfolio and am REALLY impressed.  I recommend this site to anyone who purchases and tracks their portfolio.&quot;<br>

&quot;The need for your service is tremendous.  The failure of brokerage firms to provide this information to their clients 
dismays me.  I am glad that you have filled the chasm between what brokerage firms do and what they should do.&quot;<br>
- G. Wells<br><br><hr><br>
<img src="images/new.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am a member of GainsKeeper and I must say that I am extremely satisfied with your services.  Personally I believe it is the best on the market today.  Naturally I track my portfolio every single day to evaluate the performance of my holdings using GainsKeeper.&quot;<br>

<img src="images/new.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;GainsKeeper is the most rewarding site I've found on the Internet.  Your Portfolio Tracker is everything I need to stay on top of my investments.  I've tried very hard to do that with my own spreadsheets and with other online trackers but there was always something missing.  Your system fills in the holes.  Your customer support is excellent.  I've had immediate response to my questions.&quot;<br>

&quot;Couple of weeks ago I registered at your site and entered all of my trades to date.  Today I did my federal taxes and I used your capital gains report to fill out my Schedule D.  I am writing to say thank you for the excellent report that I obtained from your site.  It made what I thought was going to be a real chore into a cakewalk.  I had approximately 60 trades this past year and I had a stack of trade confirmations that I would have had to go through to figure out my taxes.  I definitely would not have caught the wash sales I had, and probably would not have come out of it without mistakes.  By using your system, I can go to bed tonight knowing that I have done things right.  Thanks for an excellent idea.  When can I pay my registration fee that I don’t have to pay?  Please keep up the good work.&quot;<br>

&quot;I am new to trading, records, tax implications, etc.  Don't know much about spreadsheets ,software either so this has been a learning experience , your prompt and detailed support has been 5 star***** I am recommending you on all the boards.  This software is a "dream come true.  Thank you again for your A+ support.&quot;<br>
- Wayne C.<br><br><hr><br>
&quot;I did not know I could just attach your report to my tax return. That is a HUGE help (200+ trades), and your service really helped me to minimize taxes and also obey wash rules. Thanks again.&quot;<br>
- Anonymous<br><br><hr><br>
&quot;I finished my data entry and ran the reports (12 pages) and they are superb. It did everything you promised and more. Now if you could just figure out a way to eliminate my tax liability!!  :- )  Thanks again for all of your help and please keep me posted as to when it's time to subscribe, etc.&quot;<br>

&quot;You can tell from my email address that I work for the company that makes Quicken.  It is testament to your site that I would use it over Quicken.  Thank you.&quot;<br>

<img src="images/new.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I would recommend Gainskeeper to ANYONE who does any type of stock or mutual fund 
transactions to keep a running analysis of their tax position. I also used it to back track in 1999 and found out when I got my brokerage tax statements that GainsKeeper was right on the money in matching the reported revenue!  I couldn't believe it!!  I didn't have to do a lot of guessing ( I mis-keyed some info, but that was my fault).  Also GainsKeeper support staff takes ALL feedback seriously and upgrades the program to the benefit of all.&quot;<br>
- J. Stewart<br><br><hr><br>
&quot;I love your site and what it does for me.  As an investor who did a lot and learned a lot this year for the first time, it's been invaluable!  I should be set to send report to CPA and go from there!&quot;<br>

&quot;Kudos to your staff-  I submitted a problem over the weekend, and today (Monday) I had an email telling me that the problem was fixed (and it is).  This is excellent service!&quot;<br>
- Anonymous<br><br><hr><br>
&quot;Thanks, for making this program available. I just saved $16 grand in taxes by using your program. I really had no idea how to do the wash sales stuff.  Thanks.&quot;<br>

<img src="images/new.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I always had a difficult time figuring out my gains and losses at tax time. GainsKeeper has solved the problem for me!  I used GainsKeeper to record my 1999 Stock transactions.  Everything matched my 1099 statements perfectly!  I printed out the detail report from GainsKeeper and showed it to my tax accountant.  He couldn't believe how detailed and complete my record keeping was.  All he had to do was attach it to my income tax return!  Done!&quot;<br>
- M. Renna<br><br><hr><br>
<img src="images/new.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think GainsKeeper is super.  It has saved me a tremendous amount of time and effort. I intend to be a customer for a long, long time.&quot;<br>

&quot;I want you to know that the product you have here is absolutely fabulous.  Specifically why is this:  I work at Sprint Corporation.  I have a fair amount of Sprint stock and Sprint PCS stock.  As you know, Sprint PCS was spun out of Sprint Corporation a while ago thus creating a record keeping project.  We are going into a merger right now with MCIWorldCom that will create a conversion process for both FON and PCS stock to WorldCom stock that will challenge even the best.  This tool is perfect… I will invite my entire branch to set up an account with you who will in turn send the link to other people within Sprint.  There are many, many old Sprinters who have shares dating back along time ago who use spreadsheets and paper and pencil.  Also, I know many people at VoiceStream who are in a similar situation with their VoiceStream stock being spun out of their original Western Wireless shares.  I will be glad to get them interested as well.&quot;<br>

&quot;I am very excited about GainsKeeper.  As I am an active trader, it is very hard for me to keep track of all the transactions I make without having to worry about wash sales, capital gains, and losses etc.  I look forward to your new website and hope to be able to utilize it for my 1999 tax returns ...  If the site is as good as it sounds and  it really keeps track of my tax gains, washes, losses etc. I will be one of your best customers.  Again I am looking forward to it and may you be successful and just maybe you will go public one day. Good Luck!!!&quot;<br>

&quot;I noticed at 3AM California time that someone had fixed my account, and I thank you very much.  I will take care of the rest.  I think your service is wonderful and your support is fantastic.  I will put my other accounts on as I get a chance.  Thanks again.&quot;<br>

&quot;Dear GK,
<br><br>
I have been out of town for several weeks and just checked my portfolio on GainsKeeper.  I am puzzled by two entries that I did not make.  Namely, Nortel Networks and Kana Communications.  I do not own these stocks, have not entered them on my portfolio and am confused as to why they suddenly appeared?  Unless this was some kind of spin-off (of which I was unaware), it makes me question the accuracy of the entire data I so laboriously entered and causes me to be hesitant to use your services as a reliable
bookkeeping tool.
<br><br>
Please advise.
<br><br>
Sincerely,
K. Cort&quot;</span>

<span class="note1">
&quot;Dear GK,
<br><br>
Please ignore and pardon my previous email regarding "incorrect data."  It turns out that you were absolutely correct, I do own these two stocks (Nortel & Kana) as a result of some kind of stock dividend or something.  I apologize profusely and it certainly makes me appreciate the job that you guys are doing even more.  Please accept my humble regrets for suggesting that your system was less than stellar. It most certainly is!
<br><br>
Sorry...

K. Cort&quot;

<span class="pageheader">So, what happened to this GK member's portfolio?</span>  
<br><br>
<span class="note1">
GainsKeeper adjusts your holdings automatically - even if you aren't watching.
<br>The events that led to this member's confusion are as follows:
<br><br>
April 24, 2000 - B2B Internet Holders (BHH) spun off shares of Kana Communications (KANA).
<br>For every share of BHH a shareholder received .0166 shares of Kana.
<br><br>
May 9, 2000 - BCE, Inc. (BCE) spun off shares of Nortel Networks (NT).  Shareholders 
<br>received 1.570386 shares of NT for every BCE share held.

Subject: General - Schedule D<br><br>

&quot;Mike,
<br><br>
Further to my search for the best on-line Schedule D generator website, I am pulling my recommendation for clearstation.com (which by the way I learned is a wholly-owned subsidiary of E*Trade).  Why?  They upgraded their system on Saturday and it crashed and took 4-5 days! to recover.  Insult to injury they lost all customer inputted data from Jan. 6 - Jan.22!  A real nightmare for many conscientious Individuals preparing their D's early.  Their reply - Hey it's a free service!
<br><br>
I highly recommend and now use www.gainskeeper.com for Sched D's.  Real professional and more accurate than clearstation.  As they are independent of any brokerage firm, I think it is a website Q&R can recommend without any conflicts.  The gainskeeper Schedule D printout is far superior than clearstation's and much simpler to use - i.e. inputting data.
<br><br>
Please check it out.&quot;</span><br><br>
