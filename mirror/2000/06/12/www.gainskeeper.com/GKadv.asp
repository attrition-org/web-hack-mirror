<span class="note1b">Relief of Administrative Headaches</span>
<br>
<span class="note1">
Forget the spreadsheets and random pieces of paper.  GainsKeeper automatically adjusts the securities in your portfolio for trading activity, stock splits, mergers, spin-offs and other messy corporate actions.
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="note1b">Proactive Gain/Loss Offset</span>
<br>
<span class="note1">
Don’t you hate it when you sit down to do your taxes and discover that you have net gains for the prior year that you could have offset with losses?  And now it's too late!
<br><br>
GainsKeeper allows you to maximize after tax returns by giving you the information you need to accurately offset gains with losses.
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="note1b">Cost Basis Calculations</span>
<br>
<span class="note1">
Knowing your true cost basis position at all times will help you make better investing decisions.  Cost basis calculations are vital to gain/loss reporting, but tedious and difficult to do correctly.
<br><br>
GainsKeeper automatically provides you with accurate cost basis and holding period information, enabling you to maximize the effectiveness of your investing.
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="note1b">Lower CPA Bills</span>
<br>
<span class="note1">
Hey, we love accountants (really, we do), but do you really want to pay them hundreds of dollars to calculate gains and losses and create your Schedule D?  GainsKeeper does the boring bookkeeping/clerical stuff that allows you to complete your Schedule D for tax filing with a click of a mouse.  Now, time with your accountant can be spent addressing bigger issues.
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="note1b">Account Aggregation</span>
<br>
<span class="note1">
Whether you have one account or ten, GainsKeeper will solve your tax-reporting needs.  With GainsTracker you can aggregate all the accounts associated with a single taxpayer ID.
