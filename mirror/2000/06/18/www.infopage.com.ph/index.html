You see, my friends, despite what we have been told, the Philippines isn't a 
democracy. The founders of this nation, quite wise men,realized that the people 
were more than capable of being utter prats, and thus,
placed many things outside the reach of "many people."  That is what the
Constitution means when it says "Congress shall make no law."  It means no
matter how much the people whine, and beg, and scream, and whine, their elected
representatives <B>DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO CENSOR</B>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The people be damned.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Many people feel that the religious right, in their crusade to control the
world around them, do not realize that such strict laws will kill the Philippines as a member of the Internet community.  They're not as stupid as people think they are.They know the situation.  They don't care. They want to rule, period, and if what they end up ruling is a fourth-rate backwater nation, that won't matter to them.  Just so long as they are in charge.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
They know about products such as "Surf Watch" which can restrict Internet
access to certain content.  THEY DON'T CARE.  They do not want to protect their children, they wish to enslave you.  They are not "misguided."  They are not "poorly informed."  They are not "concerned parents."  *THEY* *ARE* *EVIL*. And, as they will be the first to tell you, there is no compromise or treaty with evil.  The censors must be fought, and defeated, *by any means necessary*.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Censorship is not the answer. Censorship is the question. NO is the answer.</P>
