Acceptable Use Policy</font></span>
<p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Our Acceptable Use Policy is straightforward. We ask
        you to follow the rules on the Internet and not do anything that would
        harm our network or someone else's network as a result of your actions.
        We also ask you to be responsible for the software you use, and for the
        charges you incur while you are connected. Finally, we agree to work
        with you to resolve disputes, but if we cannot agree on a solution, our
        liability is limited to the amount of your current monthly charges. To
        assume greater liability on our behalf would require us to charge higher
        rates for our service. These points are outlined in the elements of our
        Acceptable Use Policy, as defined below. This policy is subject to
        change without notice.</font></span><font size="2"><o:p>
