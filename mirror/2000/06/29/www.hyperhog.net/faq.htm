<p align="left"><b><font size="4">Q - <a name="wireless">What is Wireless?</a></font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="4">A -</font></b> The computing and communications revolution is all about sharing information
faster, with more flexibility, and over greater distances. Wireless technology
is a logical extension of this concept, freeing us from the logistic constraint
of being connected to a network cable or phone line. Although the obvious
benefit of wireless is greater mobility, it can also offer greater flexibility
in terms of physical layout -- and in some cases even cost savings -- over wired
alternatives.</p>
<p>Wireless technologies are used to address many different problems, from
insufficient bandwidth to lack of local telecom infrastructure. For the purpose
of this article, we'll assume that our reason for using wireless technology is
to access a network -- and, by extension, the Internet -- with far more mobility
than a wired solution could offer.</p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Q - <a name="ISDN">What is ISDN?</a></b></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>A - </b></font><span style="font-family:Arial">ISDN stands for Integrated Services Digital
Network, and it's designed as a replacement for Plain-Old-Telephone-Service (or
POTS). As the needs of the Information Age have rapidly increased, POTS lines
have become ever more clogged, resulting in the sluggish transmission of data. <o:p>
 </o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">ISDN's most common service, Basic Rate
Interface (BRI), provides you with two 64 Kbps channels per line. If you choose
to use both these channels for a single connection, your ISDN line is capable of
speeds of 128 Kbps. That's basically four times faster than the best analog
modem connection, which seldom exceeds 33 Kbps. <o:p>
 </o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Here's another advantage: you can also use
these two channels separately, and in tandem. Which means that you can make a
voice call on one of the lines, for example, and connect to the Internet, or to
a fax machine, on the other. And you can execute both these tasks at once. So
you've essentially got two lines in one. <o:p>
 </o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">ISDN uses the same wiring that currently
serves homes and businesses, and ISDN hook-ups are offered by the same companies
that provide telephone service. <o:p>
 </o:p>
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.0in; margin-right: 0.0in"><span style="font-family:Arial">This
is ideal for accessing the Internet and sending and receiving e-mail. The Web
page that loads in twenty seconds over a standard telephone line connection will pop up on your screen almost
instantaneously with ISDN.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.0in; margin-right: 0.0in"><span style="font-family:Arial">ISDN
lines are digital, so they're much cleaner and more dependable than analog
telephone lines. In fact, the further an analog signal travels, and the more
switches it has to pass through, the &quot;dirtier&quot; the signal. We've all
encountered static and line noise during phone calls, but this noise causes
other problems, too. For example, it can actually slow transmission speeds when
you're transferring data through an analog modem.<o:p>
 </o:p>
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.0in; margin-right: 0.0in"><span style="font-family:Arial">There
are other technical reasons for the relative sluggishness of analog POTS lines,
too. If you're currently hooked up to the Internet by modem, for example,
consider that your Internet Service Provider must convert this page's digital
content to analog signals before sending it along to you, and then convert any
signals you send-with a keystroke or a mouse click-back to digital when
receiving. With a digital connection no such conversions are necessary, so the
transfer of data is faster.<o:p>
 </o:p>
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.0in; margin-right: 0.0in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The
digital character of ISDN makes the limitations and problems of analog
technology a thing of the past.<o:p>
 &nbsp;</span></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b><a name="dsl">Q - What is DSL?</a></b></font></p>
<b><font size="4">A -</font></b> DSL (Digital Subscriber
Line) service delivers ultra-high speed dedicated access to the Internet. With
transmission speeds up to 50 times faster than the traditional 28k modem, DSL
provides business owners, telecommuters, and Internet users alike, a super fast
connection.
<p>DSL provides a constant connection to the Internet. Instead of dialing into a
remote number to connect, all you have to do is click on an icon and you're
immediately connected to the Internet
<p>DSL can handle voice and data transmissions at the same time, meaning you
don't have to order a second line, or worry about cancelling call waiting while
you are online. This is because DSL technology separates voice and data
transmissions on different bandwidths on the same telephone line. Thus, you can
talk and &quot;surf the net&quot; at the same time.
<p>DSL provides a dedicated connection to our network. Regardless of how many
users in your neighborhood are accessing our Internet Service, your connection
and speed is not affected.
<p>DSL at this time is expensive and makes the other choices, i.e. ISDN and
Wireless, more attractive considerations. However, if DSL is what&nbsp;you need
- Hyperhog is here to set it up for you, quickly and painlessly.</p>
