      <font FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE="1"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In January 1996, a meeting was
      held with the then Maricopa County Superior Court (MCSC) Presiding Criminal Judge, Ronald
      Reinstein, Director, Terry L. Stewart and Department staff, and representatives from
      Maricopa and Pima County Courts and Probation, to determine ways in which the Department
      could collaborate with these agencies to assist the courts in monitoring restitution
      payments owed by offenders once they were no longer under the purview of the Department of
      Corrections.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In October 1997, an ad hoc committee consisting of representatives from
      the Superior Court Administration, Clerk of the Court (COC), Adult Probation, Attorney
      General, Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC), and the County Attorney's Office was
      established by Judge Ronald Reinstein. The committee was formulated to review, modify,
      and/or develop a more understandable, effective restitution collection process for
      Maricopa County. This committee was further enhancement of the initial meeting (held in
      1996) aimed at creating a synergy among the various agencies utilizing criminal data to
      assure an effective restitution collection system was implemented to assist victims in
      obtaining restitution in a more timely manner.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ad hoc committee's primary goals were to:</p>

      <p ALIGN="LEFT">CURRENT PROCESS:<br>
      When inmates are released from prison under community supervision, the supervising parole
      officer mandates as a condition of supervision, that the offender begin paying victim
      restitution in accordance with the court documents. The parole officer monitors the
      offender's payments of restitution, which are sent directly to the court by the offender.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For a number of years, ADC has submitted to the COC a list of names on
      a monthly basis of inmates who have been released from prison. The Clerk utilizes the
      lists to assist in more effectively tracking restitution payments. In the spirit of
      cooperation, Department has modified the reporting process several times throughout the
      past 10 years at the Clerk's request. These modifications have been made to provide more
      precise data and better coordination, thereby improving the management of this process.
      This &quot;paper&quot; process is still utilized.</p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT">PROPOSED PROCESS<br>
      In consultation with employees from court, and the Clerk's office, the Department recently
      acquired software which enables ADC to access information from the COC's database and
      input appropriate inmate payment and release information directly into the system. A
      designated phone line has been installed to enable ADC to access by computer the Maricopa
      County COC in order to post restitution information and share current payment data with
      parole officers who are seeking verification that payments have been made by offenders
      under supervision. The new process entails the parole officer submitting the offender's
      sentencing orders with restitution information to a central repository within Community
      Corrections. These reports are submitted at the end of the offender's supervision term so
      that paperwork can be forwarded to the Superior Court for the completion of restitution
      and criminal orders. The &quot;Paperless&quot; data system will enable the COC to track
      each offender without needing to input the data themselves. The new process will allow
      staff from both agencies to access:</p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT">1. Data on offenders whose restitution payment begin date occurs after the
      inmate is released from prison and who are not under supervision.</p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT">2. Data on offenders whose restitution payment begin date occurs after
      they have been released from prison and who are under community supervision status.</p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT">3. Verification of payments made by offenders under supervision.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the above, ADC Inmate Banking has implemented a new
      procedure for processing payments of court ordered restitution. The new procedure will
      produce a monthly batch report from the Accounts Receivable System, to enable the
      Department to submit one check by the I 0th </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="1">of each
      month to the COC for the total amount collected from inmates in prison each month. The
      report is a detailed listing of the inmate name, number, and amount collected. The process
      went into effect July 1, 1998. The report also includes the names of any victims who are
      notified by the Department upon release of the offender. This information is used by the
      Clerk's office to streamline the distribution of payments victims receive.</p>
      </font><font FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE="1"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the new system,
      the Department assists the Maricopa County Superior Court, and the Clerk's office by
      providing the victim's current address. Finally, a letter will be developed in the near
      future providing victims with an overview of the restitution system, and the phone numbers
      of the appropriate individuals the victims may contact in each agency for information and
      assistance regarding their specific case. These letters will be distributed at the time
      victims are notified of an inmate's release.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The entering of appropriate information into the Clerk's information
      base (by ADC) occurs while the inmate is in prison, if the inmate is required to pay
      restitution while incarcerated, or at the time of release when any and all community
      supervision is complete.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This multi-agency committee streamlines efforts to hold offenders
      accountable for their actions and abide by their sentencing orders.</p>
