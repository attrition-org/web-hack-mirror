      <p>In a recently released report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the United
      States Department of Justice, Arizona ranked near the top among the states in terms of the
      availability of core data elements in its correctional information system. The report,
      entitled <u>State and Federal Corrections Information Systems</u>, ranked the states
      according to the availability of data in six priority information areas, including 1)
      offender profile (offense and sentence information, criminal history, demographics,
      classification data, and release information), 2) internal order (misconduct and
      responses, legal proceedings), 3) program effectiveness (program participation, drug and
      medical testing), 4) public safety (offender registry, crimes committed after release,
      victim information, employment and residence), 5) recidivism (violations while on release,
      responses to violations and returns to prison), and 6) operational costs (program
      management, medical services, facility management).</p>
      <p>Among the 40 states which collect and maintain information on released offenders,
      percent of full data availability was assigned in the areas of demographics, offenses and
      commitments, releases and public safety, and recidivism and supervision violations.
      Arizona ranked 1st (tied with five other states at 100%) in the area of demographics, 2 nd
      (tied with Missouri at 98% and trailing Colorado) in the area of offenses and commitments,
      2&quot; (tied with North Carolina at 96% and trailing Colorado and Ohio) in the area of
      releases and public safety, and 1st (tied with seven other states at 100%) in the area of
      recidivism and supervision violations.</p>
      <p>The following chart compares Arizona's percent of full data availability in each of the
      four areas with the composite national percentage for each:</p>

      in the report was collected during January of 1998 by means of an Inventory Questionnaire
      distributed to departments of corrections in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia
      and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The inventory contained 242 questions about data
      elements and capacities of information systems. Of these, 207 were about offender-based
      data, 15 were about facilities, and 20 were about capacities to link data. A separate
      Obstacles Questionnaire collected information on barriers information officials encounter
      in producing statistical information in response to queries about offenders. This survey
      was organized into five categories, including institutional and legal, staffing, software,
      hardware, and data.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Officials in all 52 departments responded to the Inventory
      Questionnaire and telephone interviews and 51 returned the Obstacles survey.</p>
