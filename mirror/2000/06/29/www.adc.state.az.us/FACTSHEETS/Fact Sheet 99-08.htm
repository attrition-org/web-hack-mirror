      <p><em>Implementation of the Mug Photo Interface System within the Community Corrections
      Division of the Arizona Department of Corrections</em></p>
      <p>In December 1998, the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC) received a federal grant
      to implement a digitized electronic imaging system to enhance offender identification
      within the prison system and better enable the Department to exchange criminal records
      information with the Arizona Department of Public Safety and other law enforcement
      agencies in Arizona. The statewide system, Mug Photo Interface , is an adjunct to the
      existing Arizona Automated Fingerprint Identification System and will be utilized for a
      wide range of criminal justice purposes.</p>
      <p>The system is expected to be operational by July, 1999 and will enable ADC to:<ul>
        <li>Register sex offenders prior to release from prison through an electronic interface with
          local sheriffs and the Arizona Department of Public Safety.</li>
        <li>Electronically provide information required by state statute to the Motor Vehicle
          Division related to special limited term driver's licenses and identification cards for
          sex offenders.</li>
        <li>Enhance sex offender community notification efforts by local police departments and the
          Arizona Department of Public Safety by providing up-to-date digitized images of released
          sex offenders.</li>
        <li>Provide identification cards to released offenders as an acceptable means of
          identification to secure driver's licenses, employment and related social services as
          necessary. This credential will differ significantly from the inmate identification card.</li>
        <li>Generate inmate identification cards for use within the prison system.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The initial grant amount was $100,000 and is administered through the Arizona Criminal
      Justice Commission. An additional $200,000 from the same source was recently awarded and
      will be disbursed to ADC in July 1999. The funds will enable the Department to install
      digitized image equipment at 13 prison units and increase the number of automated
      fingerprint identification stations from four to six.</p>
