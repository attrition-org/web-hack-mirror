      <font FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE="3"><p ALIGN="LEFT">Arizona Revised Statutes 13-3825</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1995, the Arizona Legislature enacted a statute to enable the
      community to be notified of the presence of certain convicted sex offenders upon their
      release from prison or placement on probation. The statute's effective date was delayed
      until June 1, 1996, to allow a Community Notification Guidelines Committee to be empaneled
      and make recommendations to the Legislature for the statute's implementation. The
      Community Notification Guidelines Committee includes statewide representatives from
      Arizona law enforcement agencies, the Legislature, corrections, probation, county
      attorney's offices, the Attorney General's office, and mental health professionals.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Community Notification Guidelines Committee developed a system
      which permitted local law enforcement agencies to provide notification in a progressive
      manner, proportionately increasing the scope and nature of information provided to the
      public, depending on the risk posed to the community by the offender. The instrument is
      modeled after a similar assessment tool which was developed by the State of Minnesota for
      the same purpose and currently consists of 19 criminogenic elements and specific offense
      behavior questions. The notification system consists of three risk levels.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Level I is considered lower risk; Level 2 intermediate risk; and
          Level 3 high risk.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If an offender is determined to be a Level 1 offender, law
          enforcement may inform people residing in the offender's household that the offender was
          convicted of a sex offense, and the circumstances of that offense.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Level 2 notifications involve the police notifying the immediate
          household and neighbors, schools, community groups, and prospective employers of the
          offender's presence. This may include a flyer with a photograph of the offender, and the
          general area where the offender resides.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Level 3 notifications require that a mandatory flyer be distributed
          by the police in the neighborhood, to area schools, appropriate community groups, and to
          prospective employers. A press release is also provided to the media.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The extent of community notification for any sex offender under the
      statute is ultimately determined by local law enforcement agencies and is directly related
      to the risk the offender poses to the community.</p>
      </font><font FACE="Bookman Old Style"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the two-year period from June
      1, 1996, through June 1, 1998, the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC) released 950
      convicted sex offenders from prison. Of the 950, only 650 were subject to the community
      notification statute. Three hundred of the 950 were prior sex offenders not currently
      serving sentences for sexual offenses. They were therefore excluded from community
      notification requirements, but were required to register with the local sheriff and keep
      the sheriff informed of their current address.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of the 650 sex offenders to whom the community notification statute
      applied, notification levels were distributed as follows:</p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT">Level 1 66 offenders (10.2%)<br>
      Level 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 456 offenders (70.2%)<br>
      Level 3 128 offenders (19.6%)</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Arizona instrument was recently validated through statistical
      analysis completed by Dr. Daryl Fischer, Research Unit Manager, and will continue to be
      refined as appropriate. ADC is currently working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation
      (FBI) to determine if data can be accessed for the completion of the second phase of
      research. Further study will be undertaken if data is available to determine if any
      offenders subject to community notification in Arizona have reoffended in other states.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">The Department is pleased to be a vital team player with other state and
      local criminal justice agencies in operationalizing this very important law aimed at
      informing the public and protecting our community.<br>
