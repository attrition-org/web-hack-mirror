      <p>A portion of a Consent Decree issued in 1973 by the United States District Court of
      Arizona directed that inmates in the custody of the Arizona Department of Corrections
      (ADOC) would be allowed to receive three, twenty-five pound food packages, each year
      during the December holiday season.</p>
      <p>This Consent Decree was modified in November of 1997 by the United States District
      Court of Arizona under the direction of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, to include the
      following:</p>
      <p>&quot;eliminate the inmates' ability to receive holiday food packages&quot;</p>
      <p><em>and</em></p>
      <p>&quot;between December 10 and December 3 1 of each year, specialty food items shall be
      stocked in the inmate stores and the prisoners' weekly spending limit in the stores shall
      be increased to $100&quot;</p>
      <p>It is noted that the spending limit shall be adjusted annually to reflect inflation
      with respect to the cost of consumer goods. The non-holiday spending limit for food items
      is $40.00 per week.</p>
      <p>At this time, the court also recognized that the original Consent Decree was entered
      into voluntarily by both parties (the Arizona Department of Corrections and Evan Arthur
      Hook, et al., Plaintiffs Petitioners) and therefore, a constitutional basis for the
      provision or its modification is not at issue.</p>
      <p>In implementing this program, the ADOC has taken it upon itself to survey the inmate
      population with regard to the preference of food items to be sold in the stores, compile
      an after action report to ensure the program is operationally sound (indicating where
      adjustments may be needed), and to monitor sales activity which will aide to gauge the
      effectiveness of the program. The recent year's sales figures confirm an approximate 72%
      increase in sales during the holiday period as compared to a similar time period of
      nonholiday sales.</p>
      <p>All indicators sustain that the Holiday Store Program has successfully transitioned the
      ADOC from the external receipt of food packages to an entirely internal procurement and
      distribution of holiday food items.</p>
