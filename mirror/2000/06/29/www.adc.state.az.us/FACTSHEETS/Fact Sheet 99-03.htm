      <p>For the first time in the history of the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC),
      Arizona Correctional Industries (ACI), the Department's Division of Prison Industries, has
      constructed a manufacturing building and established a new inmate work program without any
      appropriated funding. While ACI has created a number of new industry operations and inmate
      work programs in existing facilities located in prisons throughout the state without
      appropriated funding, the new prison industry building located at the Arizona State Prison
      Complex at Florence represents the first time the division has ever funded the creation of
      both a new industry work program and the construction of a new manufacturing facility.</p>
      <p>The new ACI building which provides more than 20,000 square feet of manufacturing space
      was designed and constructed under the supervision of the Arizona Department of
      Administration. The cost of the new facility was approximately $650,000.</p>
      <p>Arizona Correctional Industries is mandated to operate fiscally self-sufficient without
      appropriated funding. The ACI Division of ADC is organized with the mission of creating
      and operating prison industry work programs which combat inmate idleness and provide
      inmates with meaningful job training and work experience that will assist them upon their
      eventual release. The new ACI facility at the Florence Prison will contain a furniture
      manufacturing operation for solid and laminated wood products and will commence operations
      during the first week of February by providing training and experience for approximately
      40 inmates on a single shift.</p>
