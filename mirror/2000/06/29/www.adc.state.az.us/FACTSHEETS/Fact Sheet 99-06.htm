      <p>In order to better address the continued critical need to recruit and retain
      correctional officers, a special task force was formed several months ago. Issues and
      approaches currently being addressed by this group include:</p>
      <p>1: Correctional Officer Recruitment Advocates (CORA): CORA is a group comprised of
      correctional officer series staff who are working toward publicizing the professional and
      community minded spirit of the security staff of the ADC. Monthly updates of activities
      (i.e. holiday food/toy drive and letter writing campaign for pay increases) will be
      published in the agency's newsletter, <strong>Directions.</strong></p>
      <p>2. Stipend Increase for Eyman, Florence and Winslow: In July, 1998, stipends at Eyman
      and Florence were increased to 10% and Winslow was increased to 15%.</p>
      <p>3. Proposed Correctional Officer Pay Plan: Efforts are currently underway to develop
      and obtain approval to implement a new pay plan for the security series that will take
      into consideration the individual's experience and educational achievements.</p>
      <p>4. D.I. #93 - Reinstatements: This Director's Instruction was recently published, which
      reduces processing times for reinstatements, thereby expediting the placement of
      correctional officers into vacant positions.</p>
      <p>5. Weekly CO Hiring Report: Has been modified to better manage placement of officers
      graduating from the Correctional Officer Training Academy (COTA) into locations with the
      most critical staffing shortages. Are also now able to monitor hiring pool statistics
      (i.e. job offers) and COTA statistics.</p>
      <p>6. Van Pool Program: This program has been highly successful and efforts are underway
      to extend the program to ASPC-Winslow and expand the program in the Florence/Eyman
      complexes.</p>
      <p>7. Child Care. A special team was, formed to review various options available to assist
      employees with child care. Options being researched include a day care center, sick child
      care opportunities, reimbursement of a percentage of child care costs, child care referral
      service. A survey was conducted in Winslow to evaluate employees' needs and preferences.
      Survey information will be used in the final recommendation to the Director.</p>
      <p>8. Part-time /Seasonal Employees: Efforts are underway to identify and solicit staff
      who have retired, resigned or otherwise left the agency in good standing, to attempt to
      recruit them as part-time or seasonal employees.</p>
      <p>9. 2 for 1 Recruitment Drive: Director's Instruction #99 was effected on December 22,
      1998 which enables a Correctional Officer to choose one of several options if they recruit
      two new Correctional Officers to replace them.</p>
      <p>10. Satellite Recruitment Centers (SRC's) All Institutions now have on-site Satellite
      Recruitment Centers to facilitate the application and testing processes for potential
      Correctional Officers.</p>
      <p>11. Recruitment Unit for Selection/Hiring (RUSH) Process Review Committee: A committee
      has been formed to review the current hiring process for Correctional Officers in an
      attempt to streamline the process wherever possible.</p>
      <p>12. RUSH Recruitment Staff: The personnel dedicated to the recruiting effort has been
      increased from 20 staff members to 37. Four of the newly assigned staff members are
      dedicated solely on &quot;hand holding&quot; applicants through the process. The increase
      in staff includes an additional Satellite Recruiting Center.</p>
      <p>13. Aggressive Advertising Campaign: RUSH has been utilizing an aggressive advertising
      campaign this fiscal year which includes billboard and radio advertising.</p>
      <p>14. Web Site Information: Reciprocal relationships with some of our neighboring
      communities, and links to their web sites, have been established. The Web Site is updated
      daily to ensure accurate and complete information is available.</p>
      <p>15. Speakers Bureau- The first group of line-staff met at the Correctional Officers
      Training Academy on December 2 &amp; 3, 1998. Representatives from each complex were in
      attendance. Guest lecturer, Pat O'Brien from Arizona Game and Fish Department, assisted
      Camilla Strongin, Public Information Officer, in teaching the group about public speaking.
      Much of the group were representatives from CORA and have already begun to apply their
      skills by promoting ADC in a positive light within their communities. The Speaker's Bureau
      will be an on-going project with many staff already expressing a desire to participate in
      future training sessions.</p>
      <p>16. Field Training Officer (FTO) Program: This program provides for the one-on-one
      supervision, training, guidance and evaluation of CO's who are, upon graduation from the
      -academy, assigned to an institution. It is being piloted at ASPC-Florence, Central Unit
      and will be evaluated during March, 1999. Expansion of the program is contingent upon the
      outcome of the assessment.</p>
      <p>17. Consultants Report: External consultants were hired to research correctional
      officer salaries and retention issues. Discussions with focus groups were conducted at
      each institution followed by an assessment of surveys completed by correctional officers.
      Other documentation and reports which are indicators of hiring and retention trends were
      also analyzed. A report was ided to Director Stewart on January 28, 1999 with recommend
      cour of action</p>
