      <p>An Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC), Prison Operations Task
      Force was convened to review and update the procedures and policies
      related to the areas of inmate management listed above. A single combined
      policy which incorporated these policies, as well as the many interim
      addendum changes that were instituted since the publishing of the parent
      policies, was the result of the Task Force endeavor. The Task Force
      received content input and review from ADC Legal Services who participated
      in the review process. Highlights are listed below.</p>
      <p>All inmates are to obtain all personal property items, including arts
      &amp; crafts (hobby) materials, with the exception of specialty items such
      as some religious articles, publications etc., through the inmate store at
      the prison facility. This will include items such as, televisions, radios,
      electric shavers and athletic shoes, which were previously authorized to
      be received from family members, vendors and others.</p>
      <p>This program has been instituted to standardize the types of property
      available to an inmate. It will also aid to reduce the introduction of
      contraband into the prison system, make it less of an incentive for one
      inmate to extort property from another, and result in a savings of staff
      time previously required to search and process packages coming into the
      prison system from difficult to control outside sources.</p>
      <p>As an alternative to receiving property from sources outside of the
      prison system, inmates are authorized to receive money, which will be
      placed into the inmate's prison trust account. The inmate may then
      purchase items from the inmate store using this money.</p>
      <p>The weekly spending limit has been increased for most inmates based on
      their security level, to a maximum of $60.00 per week for inmates at the
      lowest custody levels (I &amp; 2), while Level five (5) inmates shall
      remain at the current $40.00 weekly limit. Additionally, the purchase of
      any single item over $ 10.00 will not count against the spending limit.
      Also, the authorization to purchase certain store items has been
      restricted based on the inmate's custody status.</p>
      <p>Permission has been added for inmates to correspond with a minor that
      is their own child or step-child.</p>
      <p>The new policy specifically prohibits inmates from sending or receiving
      mail containing lewd, threatening or similarly offensive material.</p>
      <p>Postage stamps, which have been used as a form of currency and in
      extortion schemes, are now prohibited</p>
      <p>from being delivered through the mail. This restriction does not apply
      to self-addressed, stamped envelopes received from and return addressed to
      the inmate's attorney of record, or to those inmates in Central Unit at
      the Florence Prison. Postage stamps are available for purchase at the
      inmate store.</p>
      <p>Any inmate entering or returning to the Department's custody on or
      after the effective date of the new policy, shall be authorized property
      only as listed in the new policy. This does not include inmates returning
      due to a short term absence for medical or court issues.</p>
      <p>Inmates that are in the Department's custody prior to the effective
      date of the new policy, who are in possession of previously authorized
      property which is not listed in the new authorized property list, must
      dispose of that property no later than three (3) years from the effective
      date of the new policy.</p>
      <p>Three years from the effective date of the new policy, all inmates
      shall only be authorized that property which is listed in the authorized
      property list in effect at that time. All other property, which would then
      be considered contraband, may be sent out by the inmates or, at their
      request, placed into storage with ADC.</p>
      <p>The new policy will be placed into effect on October 11, 1999. The
      &quot;Notice of Change&quot; regarding these issues was posted on inmate
      bulletin boards beginning September-1, 1999. Selected staff have been made
      available to address inmate questions and concerns regarding these changes</p>
