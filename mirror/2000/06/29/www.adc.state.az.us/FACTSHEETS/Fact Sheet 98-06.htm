      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">During September 1998, the Research Unit of the
      Arizona Department of Corrections. (ADC) completed an analysis of sex offenders released
      from ADC custody over the ten-year period from July 1988 through June 1998. A released
      offender was included in the study if he or she was serving time for one or more sex
      offenses just prior to release from incarceration. Offenders were tracked only with
      reference to the first release from a given criminal sentence.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">The record of each targeted sex offender was
      reviewed to determine if the offender returned to the custody of the Department by June
      30, 1998, and if so, under what circumstances. Returns for technical violations were
      distinguished from returns with new felony convictions. In cases of new convictions,
      information was recorded concerning the nature of all new conviction offenses. Preliminary
      findings from the study are as follows:</font></small><ul>
        <li><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">2,444 sex offenders were released from ADC custody
          over the ten-year period. The average period of follow-up (to June 30, 1998) for all sex
          offenders was 54.5 months. Among the 2,444, 509 or 20.8 % returned at least once to the
          custody of the Department, including 346 or 14.2% with new felony convictions. While sex
          offenders returned to prison for a variety of new crimes, 78 or 3.2% returned for a new
          felony sex offense, and an additional 90 or 3.7% returned for a new violent felony
          offense.</font></small></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">Among the 2,444 released sex offenders, 1,087
          (44.5%) were released to the supervision of ADC parole officers. Among this group, eight
          (8) or 0.7% were found to have committed a new sex offense during the period of parole
          supervision. Among the eight (8), one (1) or 0.1% returned to custody with a new sex
          offense conviction while still under supervision. The remaining seven (7) were returned to
          custody after termination of the period of supervision.</font></small></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">The most serious new sex offense committed by the
          78 sex offense recidivists was:</font></small></li>
      </ul>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Child molestation or sexual conduct with a minor 34(44%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rape or sexual assault 22(28%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexual indecency (exposing) 14(18%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexual abuse 8(10%)</font></small><ul>
        <li><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">Among the 78 sex offense recidivists, the timing
          of the commission of new sex offenses was as follows:</font></small></li>
      </ul>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      35 (45%) were committed within the first year after release; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19 (24%) were committed within the
      second year after release; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 (10%) were committed within
      the third year after release; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 (4%) were committed within
      the fourth year after release; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 (8%) were committed within
      the fifth year after release; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 (5%) were committed within
      the sixth year after release; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 (4%) were committed within
      the seventh year after release.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">The Department of Corrections is currently
      working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to determine if data can be
      accessed for the completion of the second phase of the research. Further study will be
      undertaken if data is available to ascertain if any of the offenders in the study have
      re-offended and have entered secure custody in other jurisdictions. It is anticipated that
      the report on the first phase of the research will be published before the end of the
      year. For further information, please contact the Department of Corrections.</font></small></p>
