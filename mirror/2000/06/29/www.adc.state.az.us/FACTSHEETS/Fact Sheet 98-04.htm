      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">The Community Corrections Division protects the
      public by effectively processing releases and supervising offenders who are released under
      any form of community supervision. The Division identifies and returns to prison those
      offenders who seriously violate their conditions of supervision and who threaten public
      safety.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">The Division consists of Community Supervision
      Bureau, Bureau of Fugitive Services/ Sex Offender Notification, and Interstate Compact
      Services Unit.</font></small></p>
      <p align="center"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style"><u><br>
      Community Supervision Bureau</u></font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">The Community Supervision Bureau utilizes parole
      officers to supervise inmates released on community supervision, to include completing
      pre-release investigations, job placement, referrals to transitional services and
      urinalysis testing. Parole officers provide due process to inmates on supervised release
      who are charged with seriously violating their conditions of supervision. The Bureau also
      administers Home Arrest (HA) and the revocation hearing process.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">HA provides community based supervision utilizing
      electronic monitoring for inmates who have been released on HA by the Board of Executive
      Clemency (BOEC).</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">The Revocation Hearing Unit prepares and presents
      cases at revocation hearings conducted by the BOEC for released inmates who have seriously
      violated their conditions of supervision. This unit also schedules and conducts revocation
      hearings on inmates released under supervision on statutory releases.</font></small></p>
      <p align="center"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style"><u><br>
      Bureau of Fugitive Services/Sex Offender Notification</u></font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">The Fugitive Services Bureau prepares arrest
      warrants, places and removes jail holds, and ensures due process requirements are met when
      released inmates violate conditions of supervision and are returned to custody. Staff
      coordinate extraditions and &quot;release to detainers&quot;, and enter needed information
      regarding fugitives into the Arizona Criminal Justice Information System. The Bureau also
      administers the state's Sex Offender Notification process for the Department and the
      violent sexual predator civil commitment screening process to determine if referrals will
      be made to the County Attorney's offices.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">The Sex Offender Community Notification staff
      identify and profile sex offenders being released from ADC; coordinate with local law
      enforcement agencies statewide and with the Arizona Department of Public Safety; and
      provide ongoing training to local law enforcement agencies on the sex offender
      notification process in Arizona. These staff members also review and complete the
      screening process on inmates pending release from prison for possible civil commitment to
      the state hospital as violent sexual persons.</font></small></p>
      <p align="center"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style"><u><br>
      Interstate Compact Services Unit</u></font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">The Interstate Compact Services Unit coordinates
      parole transfers between states, serves as the liaison for interstate information and
      special investigation requests from other states on pardons, clemency, or pre-sentence
      reports. The Unit coordinates the return of parole violators for incarceration from the
      &quot;sending states&quot;, and acts as a liaison with various state and local criminal
      justice agencies for those states when procedural problems arise. The unit also
      administers the Interstate Agreement on Detainer for inmates incarcerated elsewhere who
      are returned to Arizona for trial on untried criminal charges.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      Among the major accomplishments in Fiscal year 1998, Community Corrections Division:</font></small><ul>
        <li><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">Provided community supervision to 9,916 offenders
          during 1998, with an average of 88 parole officers. Approximately 83 percent of the
          supervised offenders either remained on supervision or successfully completed supervision.
          There were 1,702 violators returned to custody.</font></small></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">Represented the Department in 1,501 revocation
          hearings before the BOEC and conducted approximately 69 revocation hearings on offenders
          statutorily released under supervision or for Interstate Compact parole cases. Of the
          revocation cases presented, the BOEC found 99 percent in violation. Of these, 89 percent
          of the offenders heard were revoked and re-incarcerated.</font></small></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">Opened an additional parole office in the City of
          Mesa, which allows the Department to better protect the community and to monitor and
          manage offenders locally.</font></small></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">Completed 10,504 pre-placement investigations and
          made approximately 94,606 contacts with offenders.</font></small></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">Reviewed 899 sex offender cases for
          Notification/Sex Offender Registration or sexual predator applicability. Of the total
          number of sex offender cases reviewed, 344 were subject to community notification and 189
          cases were subject to registration only.</font></small></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">Arranged transportation and extradition for 360
          fugitives apprehended out of state. In addition, the Fugitive Services Unit placed 1,555
          local jail holds, released 645 jail holds, and processed 2,989 warrants.</font></small></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">As a result of the Legislature funding additional
          parole officer positions in 1995, research was completed to determine the impact of a
          lower parole officer to offender supervision ratio. The research revealed that the number
          of offenders committing new crimes while under supervision declined by 33% between
          1994-1996, yet the number of offenders being returned for technical violations (failure to
          abide by conditions of supervision not resulting in a new criminal conviction) remained
          relatively constant. Although the results of the research is preliminary, the data appears
          to indicate that a lower parole supervision ratio does positively impact the umber of ne
          offenses committed by an offender while on supervision.</font></small></li>
