      discovered that the Inmate Health Services Central Office process for
      tracking Inmate letters and grievances and copying medical records, was
      unable to handle an increasing volume. In an effort to solve this problem,
      an interdisciplinary team was Armed to improve and create better systems
      for the Central Medical Records Program. As a direct result of this team,
      the following improvements to the Medical Records Program have been
      implemented:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All processes of the Medical Records
      Program area have been flow-charted. This ensures that all staff involved

          tracking system was developed by team members To date, there are 2,000
          entries this year. This system automates cover sheets, request forms,
          reports, notification of approaching deadlines that simplifies
          information retrieval and decreases duplication of effort by health
          staff.</font></li>
