    crime are so interconnected and that a high percentage of any correctional population has
    a history of substance abuse, the Arizona Department of Corrections continually strives to
    improve upon its substance abuse services continuum. This overview identifies the major
    system components in the approximate sequence an inmate would encounter them, i. e. intake
    and needs assessment, pre-treatment (intervention and drug education), substance/alcohol
    abuse treatment, self-help/mutual-help support groups, and transition/aftercare services.</p>

      <p align="left">Upon arrival at a Department intake unit (either the Arizona State Prison Complex -
      Phoenix Alhambra for males or the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville Santa Maria
      for females), inmates are interviewed to determine the extent of their drug and alcohol
      abusing history. Using a combination of interview information and corroborating file
      documentation, intake staff assign an Alcohol/Drug Treatment Needs Score, which - along
      with needs scores in other areas - becomes part of the inmate's classification profile.
      A/D Scores are assigned on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 representing the most acute need for
      intervention and treatment. Each inmate's classification profile is reviewed every 180
      days for the duration of the sentence; if programming has been successfully completed
      within that time period, consideration is made of reducing the score according to a system
      prescribed in the ADC Classification Operating Manual. The A/D Score may also be increased
      if an inmate is found guilty of using drugs while in prison.</p>

      contracted providers, which has the disadvantage of limiting access to services by all
      inmates. Since 1994 the number of Department treatment beds has increased dramatically,
      however, and a small contingent of full time substance abuse professional staff have been
      hired.</p>

        <p align="left">To ensure maximization of the limited number of treatment beds available, each

        suggests that the most effective time to provide treatment is at the end of an inmate's
        sentence, immediately prior to release. Entry criteria, therefore, require that an inmate
        be within a designated length of time until earliest release before he or she can be
        considered for placement into a treatment unit. Until more resources become available, not
        every inmate serving a sentence within the Arizona Department of Corrections can expect to
        receive drug and alcohol treatment while incarcerated.</p>

        <p align="left">This approximate nine month intensive program employs a cognitive-behavioral,
        values-based approach to emphasize personal responsibility and teach participants how to
        manage the many tangential aspects of addiction, such as anger, stress, domestic violence,
        parenting, and mental and physical health. The Department's goal to place inmates in this
        program who are near release cannot always be realized at this unit since Winchester and
        Manzanita are Level 3 institutions (roughly comparable to medium custody).</p>

        Treatment Facility <i>Turning Point</i> Program.&nbsp; 350 males and 100 females</p>
        <p align="left">This privatized institution offers a fourteen-week intensive program, followed by a
        second phase of indefinite duration during which an inmate does release preparation
        planning. The program is cognitive-behaviorally based and may include inmates with either
        drug or alcohol problems. The goal with this program is to release inmates directly to the
        community upon completion.</p>

        <p align="left">In Arizona, DUI Units have historically included strong community work programs to
        provide an inexpensive labor force to the surrounding communities and build a work ethic
        among inmate laborers. The contracted treatment program offers five hours of education
        and/or treatment weekly for all inmates at the unit, focusing on alcohol-related issues,
        and also addressing drug use and associated issues. In addition to the treatment program,
        many inmates participate in an extensive off-site work program as well as business skills
        and similar classes presented by Cochise Community College.</p>

        opportunities. The treatment program, which is delivered by staff employed directly by the
        private prison corporation, focuses primarily on alcohol abuse, but the concepts transfer
        easily to drug abuse. Additionally, many seminar-type classes such as parenting, family
        dynamics of addiction, and stress management are provided. To the extent possible,
        treatment services at privatized DUI treatment units mirror those provided at ADC-operated

        around the Hazelden <u>Design for Living</u> curriculum. After release, each participant
        is also provided four months of transitional/aftercare services. This program is somewhat
        unique in that it represents a collaboration between the Departments of Corrections and
        Health Services. ADHS completely funds the program, but all services are delivered within

      services and treatment for offenders on community supervision, another unique partnership
      was established with between the Departments of Corrections (ADC) and Health Services
      (DHS). Through an intergovernmental agreement, ADC has placed one staff position within
      each of the existing Regional Behavioral Health Authorities, which operate under DHS
      purview. These Correctional Officer/Offender Liaisons (COOLs) work with Parole Officers to
      identify the services that best match the offender's needs and refer offenders
      appropriately. Participating offenders pay a co-pay for all services, but sliding fee
      scales bring programming within financial reach. The COOL is able to assist not only with
      transitional services and aftercare for offenders who have participated in one of the
      Department's formal treatment programs, but also with arranging for drug and alcohol
      treatment for those who had no opportunity to participate in formal treatment while
      incarcerated.</p>
