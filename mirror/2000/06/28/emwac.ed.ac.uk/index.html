Okay, So this is supposed to be a "Certified Microsoft Facility". 
Yes, I know. You guys need those sample files installed, and it's
not really your fault since you didn't get notice from Micro$oft
about this hole (Admin: C:\ExploitHole.txt) from Microsoft. Even if they
did warn you they deserve to burn for distributing a security-hole
in a box... That shows you how to "make the most" of your NT system...<BR>
<BR>
Put more sharply, If your teaching security with Microsoft products here
then you are doing fine, representing Microsoft 100%.. (According to the
Windows NT standard.) If you think i'm just raving on then examine
the graph below:

LMAO, Look at that! The number of NT hacks over a 29 day moving adverage!
Is it just me or is NT really, really, insecure? it makes me wanna puke
with laughter or shock... now let's have a look at the other
different (um... better) operating systems:

Those who will accuse me of being a "lamer" for doing this i say:<BR>
Get lost! I could have done <U>anything</U> on this system and i only
defaced this site for the intent of notifiying them about the security-hole.<BR>
Well, My opinion on the "punched in the nose" dilemma is that it's better
to have your nose tapped very strongly right now... Rather than have someone
kick it 9 feet into your skull later on... mmkay? ... so in essence... i'm kinda
doing you a favor admin... ((P.S Admin: Remember --- C:\ExploitHole.txt))<BR>

Oh, Jezzus...NT Vunerablitiez... I think i'm gonna be sick with
shock/laughter ... Didn't Microsoft use'd to be a GOOD company.. I mean
my first language was AmigaBasic By Microsoft back in around the '80's.. 
I liked programming because i started with such a good language but now
they can't get anything right, even their own calculator, calc.exe...
