Hi.

We're still here.

Maybe a little less knowledgeable.

Maybe less mature and less self-assured, but we are here nonetheless.

This is still our world, the world of the photon and the router, the beauty of
the Megabit.
        
We still make use of a service already existing without paying for what could
be even cheaper than before if it weren't still run by profiteering gluttons,
and you still have the gall to call us animals.

We still explore - and you continue to call us criminals.

We seek after more knowledge - and you persevere in calling us criminals.

We still exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias
- even more so - and you call us criminals - even more so.

You build bigger atomic bombs, you wage subtler wars, you murder with greater
precision, cheat and lie to us better than ever and still try to make us 
believe it is for our own good - yet we are always the criminals.

Yes, we remain criminals.
        
Our crime is still that of curiousity.

Our crime is still that of judging people by what they say and think, not what
they look like.
        
Our crime is still that of outsmarting you, something that you will NEVER 
forgive us for.

We are hackers, phreaks, cyberpunks, crackers, script kiddies - or whatever you
and your media feels like calling us.

This is and will always be, our manifesto. 

You may stop some of us, but you will never stop us all.
