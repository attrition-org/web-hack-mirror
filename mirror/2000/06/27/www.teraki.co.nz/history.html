<b>KUPE</b></font>
<font color="#642C02" face="arial" size="1">- and his crew in their waka (canoe) <em>Matawhaorua</em>,
journeyed far from their home in Hawaikinui, deep into the southern ocean where they first visited the land they named 
<em>Te Ika a Maui</em> (Maui's fish), around 950 AD.<br>
Kupe's wife <em>Kuramarotini</em> gave the land the name
<em> Aotearoa</em> meaning the <em>Land of the Long White Cloud</em>.<br><br>
Their waka made its first landing in New Zealand on the shores of the <a href="hokianga.html">
HOKIANGA HARBOUR</a> and many Northland tribes proudly trace their ancestry back to Kupe and his crew.<br><br>
European settlement began in Northland in the late eighteenth century with
scientific expeditions, traders then missionaries, making their way to the North.<br>
On Christmas Day in 1814, in the Bay of Islands,
Samuel Marsden is credited with preaching the first Christian sermon in New Zealand.<br><br>
The Stone Store and Kemp House , still standing in Kerikeri - <em>'Cradle of the Nation'</em> -
are respectively the oldest stone building and oldest house in New Zealand.<br><br>
At Waitangi - <em>'Birthplace of the Nation'</em> -
a copy of the treaty that tied the lives of Euorpean and Maori together, even to the present day,
was signed in 1840.<br><br>
Across the harbour from Waitangi, Russell <em>(or Koroareka as it was then known)</em> was the site of New Zealand's earliest centre of government
and was once known as 'the Hell Hole of the Pacific'.<br><br>
