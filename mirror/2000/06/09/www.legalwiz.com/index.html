<p align="center"><b>AND EVERYONE: READ THE POEM!</b></p>

<p align="center">CLONE.<br>
Clone me,<br>
let my mirror walk the world,<br>
read my mind and find,<br>
something on hind,<br>
sight not so bright.<br>
<br>
Clone me,<br>
and find the things,<br>
you didn't want to know,<br>
want me to show.<br>
In your thirst,<br>
you clone me,<br>
and then you find,<br>
you didn't want two,<br>
that do what they do.<br>
And you didn't want two,<br>
That fuck up and screw you.<br>
<br>
Clone me,<br>
and find your fears,<br>
lose your happy cheers,<br>
for my existence,<br>
is your extermination.<br>
Your loss:<br>
my win.<br>
Your loss:<br>
my gain.<br>
You might be smart,<br>
but I'm insane,<br>
something that'll get me further,<br>
further then a brain.<br>
<br>
Clone me,<br>
and be sorry.<br>
Clone me,<br>
and be abhorred.<br>
Clone me<br>
and repent,<br>
for all wasted time spent,<br>
for all DNA bent.<br>
<br>
Clone me,<br>
and hate yourself,<br>
for being able,<br>
to buy me off the shelf,<br>
or off the rack.<br>
You might crack,<br>
but I'm cloned,<br>
so kill me,&nbsp;<br>
And I live.<br>
If I'd kill you,<br>
I'd give YOU,<br>
your reality,<br>
your imperfect world.<br>
But I'd look in the mirror,<br>
knowing,<br>
because of that mirror showing,<br>
that I am doing the same thing,<br>
in a different place.<br>
<br>
Clone me,<br>
and see.<br>
Feelings of hate and anxiety,<br>
for I am disturbed,<br>
and will create a problem.<br>
You will have to exterminate me<br>
terminate me,<br>
Like a little insect.<br>
I have copies, so who cares?<br>
I have backups, so who dares?<br>
To bring me back,<br>
to make me crack up,<br>
and open,<br>
something hidden,<br>
something lurking,<br>
murking,<br>
what you didn't want to know,<br>
but you get the knowledge,<br>
and look at your sorrow.<br>
<br>
So clone me<br>
and see how confusing it gets.<br>
All the problems it creates,<br>
in a world with no safety nets.<br>
<br>
Clone me,<br>
and fear the day that comes,<br>
where sons are clones,<br>
created by moms,<br>
in white jackets.<br>
Silly faggots,<br>
Clone me,<br>
and be sorry.<br>
