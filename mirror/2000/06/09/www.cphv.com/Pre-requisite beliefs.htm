<body lang=EN-US class="Normal" bgcolor="#ffffff">
<p> It’s amazing what one has to believe to believe 
  in gun control: </p>
<p> That a punk wakes up one morning, and thinks, 
  “Gee, instead of robbing, raping, sodomizing and killing a young woman, why 
  don’t I turn my $400 gun in for $20 and a pizza and go work at McDonalds?” </p>
<p> That the more helpless you are, the safer 
  you are from criminals. </p>
<p> That you should give a mugger your wallet, 
  because he doesn’t really want to shoot you and he’ll let you go, but that you 
  should give him your wallet, because he’ll shoot you if you don’t. </p>
<p> That Washington DC’s low murder rate of 69 
  per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis’ high murder rate 
  of 5.5 per 100,000 is attributable to the utter lack of gun control.  </p>
<p> That despite all the outrage about Corporate 
  America’s cavalier treatment of employees, Domino’s Pizza’s demand that employees 
  be unarmed is an altruistic effort to stop them from hurting themselves, and 
  not a calculated financial bid to avoid having a lawsuit filed by a dead robber’s 
  family. </p>
<p> That one can sue a store for having a slick 
  floor, falling ceilings, and sharp corners, but if they refuse to let you bring 
  a gun in and you get shot by a criminal, they aren’t liable for enforcing that 
  rule with others. </p>
<p> That there is no right of self defense, but 
  the police are not legally obligated to respond to my cries for help when disarmed, 
  but you can sue them if they take too long to get to a traffic accident. </p>
<p> That assault rifles are far too powerful 
  to hunt deer and elk, and too dangerous for private citizens to own, but are 
  too impotent for modern warfare, too weak to reliably kill soldiers, and have 
  no place in the concept of a citizen reserve. </p>
<p> That the preferred weapon of a drug dealer 
  is a $25 .22 pocket pistol, and the preferred weapon of a drug dealer is a $2000 
  machinegun. </p>
<p> That any cheap weapon is a “Saturday night 
  special,” and any expensive weapon is an “assault weapon.” </p>
<p> That “Cops” and other shows are edited to 
  show the boring encounters with traffic stops and the occasional drunken fool 
  with a revolver in his pocket, and never show the millions of cases where the 
  cops are gunned down in droves by machinegun toting drug dealers. </p>
<p> That “NYPD Blue” and “Miami Vice” are documentaries. </p>
<p> That an intruder will be incapacitated by 
  tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .44 Magnum will get angry and kill 
  you. </p>
<p> That firearms in the hands of private citizens 
  are the gravest threat to world peace, and China, Pakistan and Korea can be 
  trusted with nuclear weapons. </p>
<p> That Charlton Heston as president of the 
  NRA is a shill who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas as a representative 
  of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience 
  at the UN arms control summit. </p>
<p> That ordinary people, in the presence of 
  guns, turn into slaughtering butchers, and revert to normal when the weapon 
  is removed. </p>
<p> That someone who fails to clear his weapon, 
  fails to point it in a safe direction, pulls the trigger without checking the 
  chamber, and blows his foot off is an example of how even a “trained professional” 
  can be a “victim” of a diabolical gun, but people in the military, who clean 
  weapons millions of times a year without getting hurt, are “dumb grunts.” </p>
<p> That the New England Journal of Medicine 
  is filled with expert advice about guns, just like Guns and Ammo has some excellent 
  treatises on heart surgery. </p>
<p> That one should consult an automotive engineer 
  for safer seatbelts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for spinal 
  paralysis, a computer programmer for Y2K problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms 
  expertise. </p>
<p> That the best thing our kids can do to bullies 
  and drug dealers is “just say no,” and fight back, and the best thing we can 
  do to bullies and drug dealers is to give them $50 and wait for them to go away. </p>
<p> That it’s outrageous that the Milwaukee police 
  took 45 minutes to respond to reports of Jeffrey Dahmer’s last victim running 
  around naked in the cold, then returned him to his attacker without checking 
  ID, but the best thing a citizen can do in an emergency is dial 911.  </p>
<p> That the “right of the <b>people</b> peaceably 
  to assemble,” the “right of the <b>people</b> to be secure in their homes,” 
  “enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others 
  retained by the <b>people</b>,” “The powers not delegated herein are reserved 
  to the states respectively, and to the <b>people</b>,” refer to individuals, 
  but “the right of the <b>people</b> to keep and bear arms” refers to the states. </p>
<p> That the 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1791, 
  allows the states to have a National Guard, created by act of Congress in 1916. </p>
<p> That the National Guard, paid by the federal 
  government, occupying property leased to the federal government, using weapons 
  owned by the federal government, punishing trespassers under federal law, is 
  a state agency. </p>
<p> That private citizens can’t have handguns, 
  because they serve no militia purpose, even though the military has hundreds 
  of thousands of them, and private citizens can’t have assault rifles, because 
  they are military weapons. </p>
<p> That it is reasonable for California to have 
  a minimum 2 year sentence for possessing but not using an assault rifle, and 
  reasonable for California to have a 6 month minimum sentence for raping a female 
  police officer. </p>
<p>That it is reasonable to jail people for carrying but not using guns, but outrageous 
  to jail people for possessing marijuana.  </p>
<p> That minimum sentences violate civil rights, 
  unless it’s for possessing a gun. </p>
<p> That door-to-door searches for drugs are 
  a gross violation of civil rights and a sign of fascism, but door-to-door searches 
  for guns are a reasonable solution to the “gun problem.” </p>
<p> That the first amendment absolutely allows 
  child pornography and threats to kill cops, but doesn’t apply to manuals on 
  gun repair. </p>
<p>That a woman in a microskirt, perfume and a Wonderbra, without underwear, is 
  a helpless victim, but someone getting paid $6 an hour to deliver the cash from 
  a fast food place to the bank at the same time every night is, &quot;asking 
  for it.&quot;  And you won't allow either of them to carry a gun.</p>
<p>That Illinois' law that allows almost any government official from Governor 
  to dogcatcher to carry a gun is reasonable, and the law that prohibits any private 
  citizen, even one with 50 death threats on file and a million dollar jewelry 
  business, is reasonable.  And it isn't a sign of police stateism.</p>
<p>That the 80 religious kooks in Waco were a threat to American security, but 
  snipers killing them as they left the building, machinegunning children, hiding 
  the video evidence, possibly torching the building on purpose, and having no 
  case to present in federal court is good law enforcement.  And it isn't a sign 
  of police stateism.</p>
<p> That free speech entitles one to own newspapers, 
  transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self defense only justifies bare 
  hands. </p>
<p> That with the above, a 90 lb woman attacked 
  by a 300 lb rapist and his 300 lb buddy, has the “right” to kill them in self 
  defense, provided she uses her bare hands. </p>
<p>That there’s nothing in the Constitution that specifically prohibits banning 
  certain guns, but there is something in the Constitution that specifically prohibits 
  banning certain sex acts.  </p>
<p> That gun safety courses in school only encourage 
  kids to commit violence, but sex education in school doesn’t encourage kids 
  to have sex. </p>
<p> That the ready availability of guns today, 
  with only a few government forms, waiting periods, checks, infringements, ID, 
  and fingerprinting, is responsible for all the school shootings, compared to 
  the lack of school shootings in the 1950’s and 1960’s, which was caused by the 
  awkward availability of guns at any hardware store, gas station, and by mail 
  order. </p>
<p> That we must get rid of guns because a deranged 
  lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time, and anyone who owns a gun out 
  of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid. </p>
<p> That there is too much explicit violence featuring guns on TV, 
  and that cities can sue gun manufacturers because people aren’t aware of the 
  dangers involved with guns.</p>
<p> That the gun lobby’s attempt to run a “don’t 
  touch” campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, and the anti-gun lobby’s 
  attempt to run a “don’t touch” campaign is responsible social activity. </p>
<p> That the crime rate in America is decreasing 
  because of gun control, and the increase in crime requires more gun control. </p>
<p> That 100 years after its founding, the NRA 
  got into the politics of guns from purely selfish motives, and 100 years after 
  the Emancipation Proclamation, the black civil rights movement was founded from 
  purely noble motives. </p>
<p> That statistics showing high murder rates 
  justify gun control, and statistics that show increasing murder rates after 
  gun control are “just statistics.” </p>
<p> That we don’t need guns against an oppressive 
  government, because the Constitution has internal safeguards, and we should 
  ban and seize all guns, therefore violating the 2nd, 4th, 5th and 9th Amendments 
  of that Constitution, thereby becoming an oppressive government. </p>
<p> That guns are an ineffective means of self 
  defense for rational adults, but in the hands of an ignorant criminal become 
  a threat to the fabric of society. </p>
<p> That guns are so complex to use that special 
  training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make 
  murder easy. </p>
<p> That guns contribute to high death rates 
  and should be banned, but tobacco and alcohol are okay. </p>
<p> That guns cause crime, which is why there 
  has never been a mass slaying at a gun show. </p>
<p> That guns cause crime, just like matches 
  cause arson. </p>
<p> That guns cause crime, just like women cause 
  prostitution. </p>
<p> That guns cause crime, just like men cause 
  rape. </p>
<p> That guns aren’t necessary to national defense, 
  which is why the army only has 3 million of them. </p>
<p> That banning guns works, which is why New 
  York, DC, and Chicago cops need guns against armed criminals. </p>
<p> That the Constitution protects us, so we 
  don’t need guns, and can confiscate them, thereby violating the 5th amendment 
  of that constitution. </p>
<p> That women are just as intelligent and capable 
  as men, and a woman with a gun is “an accident waiting to happen.” </p>
<p> That women are just as intelligent and capable 
  as men, and gunmaker’s advertisements aimed at women are “preying on their fears.” </p>
<p>That a handgun, with up to 4 switches and controls, is far too complex for 
  the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has  
  20.</p>
<p> That handguns are useful only for murder, 
  which is why the police and military define them as defensive weapons. </p>
<p> That neighbors who carry guns against the 
  occasional lunatic are paranoid, because of the perfectly justifiable fear that 
  every single one of them is waiting to turn into a lunatic. </p>
<p> That a majority of the population supports 
  gun control, just like a majority of the population used to support owning slaves. </p>
<p> That one should ignore as idiots politicians 
  who confuse Wicca with Satanism and exaggerate the gay community as a threat 
  to society, but listen sagely to politicians who can refer to a self-loading 
  small arm as a “weapon of mass destruction” and an “assault weapon.” </p>
<p>That there is no absolute right to a weapon, documented historically because 
  the British government used to prohibit Catholics from owning guns.  And that 
  wasn’t a sign of religious bigotry.</p>
<p> That rifles with pistol grips are assault 
  weapons, just like vehicles with racing stripes are sports cars. </p>
<p> That you don’t need a gun against invaders, 
  because the government will know in plenty of time to issue you whatever weapons 
  you need. </p>
<p> That Massachussetts is safer with bans on 
  guns, which is why Teddy Kennedy has machinegun toting guards. </p>
<p> That most people can’t be trusted, so we 
  should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by, because they 
  can be trusted. </p>
<p> That a woman raped and strangled with her 
  panties is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist 
  at her feet. </p>
<p> That guns should be banned because of the 
  danger involved, and live reporting from the battlefield, which can keep the 
  enemy informed of troop deployments, getting thousands of troops killed and 
  perhaps losing a war, is a protected act that CANNOT be compromised on. </p>
<p> That the right of http://www.peeingschoolgirls.com 
  cannot be questioned because it is a constitutionally protected extension of 
  the Bill of Rights, and the claim that handguns are for self defense is merely 
  an excuse, and not really protected by the Bill of Rights. </p>
<p> That the ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly 
  defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends 
  other parts of the Constitution. </p>
<p> That a house with a gun is three times as 
  likely to have a murder, just like a house with insulin is three times as likely 
  to have a diabetic. </p>
<p> That police operate in groups with backup, 
  which is why they need larger capacity magazines than civilians, who must face 
  criminals alone, and therefore need less ammunition. </p>
<p> That we should ban “Saturday Night Specials” 
  and other inexpensive guns because it’s not fair that poor people have access 
  to guns too. </p>
<p> That guns have no legitimate use, but alcohol 
  does, which is why we issue cops guns instead of beer. </p>
<p> That police and soldiers are the dregs of 
  society who were unfit to get any real job, which perfectly qualifies them with 
  the high moral standards and keen intellects to handle these complicated tools 
  and be our guardians. </p>
<p> That it’s acceptable to arm a courier at 
  $6 an hour to shoot criminals for stealing bank deposits, but unacceptable for 
  a college-educated business owner to do it himself. </p>
<p> That a registration plan will reduce crime, 
  because criminals will register their guns despite the Supreme Court decision 
  Haynes v. U.S. (309 U.S. 85, 1968) that registration violates self-incrimination. </p>
<p> That it’s reasonable to require proof of 
  a criminal act before an order of protection can be issued, and reasonable to 
  assume anyone with a gun will commit a criminal act. </p>
<p> That teaching abstinence exclusively rather 
  than use of condoms is doomed to fail, but encouraging absolute bans on guns 
  rather than education in safe use is the only acceptable method of reducing 
  crime. </p>
<p> That it is outrageous that civilians have 
  rifles that were designed for the military, for self defense, but perfectly 
  okay to have polluting, potentially unstable, heavy vehicles that were designed 
  for the military, simply as status symbols. </p>
<p> That guns are the gravest threat to society, 
  because 83,000,000 gun owners didn’t commit a crime yesterday. </p>
<p> That it is essential to incorporate locks 
  and sensors into guns to make them safer, that only a criminal would not support 
  them, and cops and federal agents would be exempt for safety reasons. </p>
<p> That a bank guard can protect money with 
  a gun, but you cannot protect your children with one. </p>
<p> That all gun dealers sell illegal weapons, 
  just like all black people sell drugs. </p>
<p> That crime is higher in urban areas with 
  less guns, and we must continue to disarm the minorities in these areas because 
  of the risk of crime, and that isn’t bigotry. </p>
<p> That an underpaid, overworked bodyguard should 
  be glad to throw himself in front of a bullet for you. </p>
<p> That your safety is someone else’s responsibility, 
  but they have no right to tell you how to live your life. </p>
<p> That guns are useless against tyranny, because 
  an armed populace of 160 million cannot defeat an army of 2 million mixed in 
  among it. </p>
<p> That if the above is true, we should not 
  be terrified of the concept of that government holding control of our lives 
  and freedom at its whim. </p>
<p> That the piecemeal destruction of the right 
  to keep and bear arms makes the right useless, and therefore justifies destroying 
  it further.  </p>
<p> That one should be more afraid of one’s spouse 
  blowing a gasket and shooting the children, than of those children being run 
  over by a hormone-driven teenager in a car. </p>
<p> “It can’t happen here.” </p>
<p> That people are too stupid to handle guns, 
  but are intelligent enough to vote. </p>
<p> That guns are not an effective means of self-defense, 
  which is why police carry them. </p>
<p> That one can “study” the “gun issue,” but 
  know the difference between an assault rifle and a battle rifle. </p>
<p> That the NRA, with over 3 million members, 
  is “out of touch” with America, and HCI, with 50 thousand members, is a “mandate 
  from the people.”  </p>
<p> That a baseball bat is good protection against 
  a burglar, provided his gun fires baseballs. </p>
<p> That to judge a group by secondhand news 
  and hearsay is bigotry, unless that group is the NRA. </p>
<p> That the National Defense Act of 1916 doesn’t 
  exist. </p>
<p> That pricing products out of the reach of 
  poor people through excessive regulation is discriminatory practice, unless 
  that product is a gun. </p>
<p> That manufacturers are not responsible for 
  damages caused by their products, unless that product is a gun. </p>
<p> That trigger locks and other devices make 
  guns safer, which is why the police and military refuse to use them. </p>
<p> That registration of guns will help law enforcement, 
  because that way they won’t need probable cause and a warrant to conduct a search. </p>
<p> That registration of guns, which makes their 
  existence a matter of public knowledge under the FOIA, isn’t dangerous to owners. </p>
<p> That registration of guns, in violation of 
  the McClure-Volkmer Act, and as declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, 
  is somehow still legal. </p>
<p> That private citizens making private sales 
  of private property is a “loophole.” </p>
<p> That making it harder to get a license to 
  sell firearms legally will reduce the number of people selling illegally. </p>
<p> That it’s safer to do nothing than resist 
  with a gun, which is why the military wins so many wars by not fighting. </p>
<p> That we must close shooting ranges because 
  of the noise, but ban silencers because they are quiet. </p>
<p> That owning a gun for self-defense indicates 
  an intent to kill, just like owning a first aid kit indicates an intent to impersonate 
  a physician. </p>
<p> That guns are an “epidemic” so we should 
  treat them with penicillin. </p>
<p> That there’s no right to own military weapons, 
  which is why the Civilian Marksmanship Program at http://www.odcmp.com exists 
  to sell military weapons to civilians under Congressional authority. </p>
<p> That suggesting teachers be armed is an outrageous 
  suggestion for a “civilized” society, which is why the Swiss and Israelis do 
  it. </p>
<p> That making it harder and harder for even 
  cops to have guns on school property will make it harder for lunatics to kill 
  the utterly helpless students. </p>
<p> That accidents with a product justify banning 
  the product, even though MADD has never called for a ban on alcohol, people 
  actively push to legalize drugs, and no one wants to ban swimming pools, so 
  basically it’s only practical items like guns we should ban and not the luxury 
  items that are essential to human survival. </p>
<p> That the 14th Amendent requires states to 
  accept each other’s drivers licenses, even with age or vision requirement differences, 
  marriage licenses even with age or relationship differences or if it’s a gay 
  marriage, but somehow doesn’t apply to licenses to carry weapons. </p>
<p> That the same people who build illegal high-tech 
  drug labs for less than $30,000 won’t build illegal low-tech gun shops for less 
  than $10,000. </p>
<p> That people with large gun collections are 
  dangerous, especially if they have more than two hands to shoot with. </p>
<p> That autoloaders are “easily converted” to 
  fully automatic fire, and the person telling you this has no idea how it’s accomplished. </p>
<p> That banning rifles with bayonet lugs will 
  cut down on all the drive-by bayonetings. </p>
<p> That shooting at an intruder who smashes 
  your door and enters with knife in hand will somehow “escalate the violence.” </p>
<p> That it is illegal to use tax money for political 
  campaigning, unless it’s to ban guns. </p>
<p> That it’s safer with less guns, which is 
  why lunatics shoot up schools instead of gun shows or police stations. </p>
<p> That guns cause crime, which is why there 
  was no rape or murder in the Dark Ages. </p>
<p> That stopping the people who don’t commit 
  murder from having guns will lessen the number of those who do. </p>
<p> Since banning a few guns hasn’t helped, we 
  should ban more. </p>
<p> That just like the anti-nuclear weapons movement, 
  if the potential victims disarm, the oppressors will take pity on them and give 
  up their weapons in remorse. </p>
<p> That oppressing gun owners until they violate 
  the law justifies oppressing them further. </p>
<p> That “crime guns” and old police guns should 
  be destroyed at government expense, because the cost of exorcising the evil 
  spirits from them before selling them to lawful owners is exorbitant. </p>
<p> That raising the legal age to possess firearms 
  from 18 to 21 will REALLY show those 16 year olds. </p>
<p>That inner-city blacks in public housing should be disarmed to prevent crimes, 
  but not rich white suburbanites.  And it isn’t a sign of racism.</p>
<p> That creating firearms crime by having a 
  Byzantine code of firearm laws proves there’s a problem, and justifies more 
  laws to create more crime. </p>
<p> That parents who give guns to problem children 
  to “teach them responsibility” are not responsible for the deaths they cause, 
  but everyone else’s guns are. </p>
<p> That gun owners are a threat by existing 
  that must be destroyed by any means possible, and their rights are unimportant, 
  but the thugs who attack us on the street who the gun owners wish to be armed 
  against are simply a problem we have to put up with. </p>
<p> That one should judge all gun owners by the 
  acts of a few criminals, just like one should judge all blacks by the acts of 
  a few inner-city crack dealers. </p>
<p> That making it harder to get firearms legally 
  will reduce their illegal use, just like making it harder to get a prescription 
  will cut down on the illicit drug trade. </p>
<p> That it’s tragic when a child dies in a firearms 
  accident, and we must pass restrictive laws to prevent it, but children poisoned 
  by household chemicals are simply unavoidable accidents. </p>
<p> That I don’t need a gun, therefore no one 
  needs one, and I have the right to impose that belief and will on them. </p>
<p>That stupidity can be cured by legislation.</p>
<p>That societies with less guns have less killings by guns.  Just like societies 
  with less cars have less vehicular homicide.</p>
<p> That criminals who rob to support their drug 
  habit can afford $65 a minute in ammunition for their automatic “Weapon of choice.” </p>
<p> That with nationwide gun control, the entire 
  nation can be as safe as NYC, LA and Chicago. </p>
<p> That since a gun isn’t 100% effective for 
  self defense, you should get rid of it, along with your first aid kit and fire 
  extinguisher, since they aren’t 100% effective, either. </p>
<p> That if Chicago were to legalize firearms, 
  it would have shootouts in the streets, which never happens now. </p>
<p> That it’s wrong to use tax dollars to finance 
  private political agendas, unless that agenda is to ban guns. </p>
<p> That a &quot;safe gun&quot; will help stop 
  criminal misuse of firearms like &quot;safe sex&quot; works so well to stop 
  rape. </p>
<p> That a cop with felonies on his record is 
  safe with fully automatic weapons and a churchgoing mother with a parking ticket 
  as her worst crime is unfit to use a pistol to protect her child. </p>
