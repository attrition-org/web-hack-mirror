        <p align="center">I got in and I defaced this site, and I can start
        about wanting to improve security, how my parents divorced and how that
        made messed me up, how I want to show off to my friends or how I want to
        change the world.<p align="center">I can just leave this defacement as
        it is: with only one easy reason: fame. And to get fame I should make
        some strange statements, but I will not.<p align="center">What I will
        say is this: think what you want, but this world is rotten. I like
        putting poetry on incredibly boring websites because it changes a really
        boring pattern we call life but is really just a pathetic state of
        boredom. Pathetic, because we don't see it ourselves. If I put poetry on
        a defacement, I figure, almost nobody will care, but maybe one, just one
        person will notice it and be minded likewise, and might be inspired to
        write his/her own poetry and maybe some person's day will become
        exciting because &quot;Uncle John can talk about this evil hacker web
        defacement&quot;, and &quot;Mark can show his friends what kind of elite
        stuff he sees&quot; and &quot;Deirdre has some cool poetry for
        philosophy class to discuss&quot;<p align="center">Again I say: this
        world is rotten. Where murderers get little punishment and electric
        criminals get a lot, where word and thought are manipulated by media,
        government and no name agencies that probably actually do the things we
        see in movies. And this place called &quot;world&quot; is where we live
        and breath and drink our brand name drinks, and eat our ultra
        genetically spliced and mutated, anti fat, extra crisp, high on vitamins
        and minerals food, while we watch Jerry Springer and aren't shocked
        anymore by the fact that a transvestite slept with two guys separately,
        and four women at the same time, and none of them know he's really a
        hermaphrodite that just wants a relationship with his dog. And even
        though we can't talk and we are zombies when we watch even less talented
        people keep on repeating &quot;Whateva! Whateva!&quot; we don't care and
        seem to be happy and don't notice that what was on Jerry Springer was so
        dumb that after thirty minutes we can't exactly say anymore who screwed
        &quot;what&quot;.<p align="center">Using three piece psychology I am a
        troubled youth. Did anyone ever care to notice the fact that we also say
        that when you reach the adolescent age we start to think about things? I
        guess nobody wants us to think and remember them of their ignorant,
        arrogant, completely dumb statements, thoughts and traditions.<p align="center">And
        then our savior will return, long live Jesus Christ, with all it's
        followers, these &quot;Christians&quot; that don't even know the bible
        and didn't bother to read Revelations and notice that only a few
        thousand will survive the apocalypse and that God will kind of destroy
        most of the earth before our beautiful sinless Christ shows up on the
        earth to make it all better again in a valley by Jerusalem. Or is it
        just my version of the bible book Revelations?<p align="center">In the
        mean time blacks, err. African American and other colored minorities and
        majorities fight for equal rights yet don't complain about positive
        discrimination and are appalled when a white wants a organization that
        mirrors BET or a local get together for a white minority in a area with
        a colored minority. Oops I can't say that, or I'm racist, or a fascist
        while all I want is to interact with people off all religions and color.<p align="center">While
        I ponder about how to do this or that, my dad who has all the answers
        gets sent off to a war that no one remembers in two years but is
        important now because CNN bothered to send a television crew down there
        to capture the latest horrors to boost it's ratings when there is enough
        violence and crime in our own country.<p align="center">Nobody learned
        anything from Columbine, insane people need not be provoked, insane
        people need attention. But when a couple of kids that get bugged all the
        time go out and kill their tormenters, the killers are the bad guys.
        Maybe words DO hurt? Or am I just a kid who doesn't know what his
        partners in age think and feel? And you see all the mothers who have
        murdered kids cry and complain, maybe they should have bothered to learn
        it things like caring and compassion. But no, they didn't do anything
        wrong, they just harassed them to death. literally.<p align="center">We
        all see things are going wrong but are too lazy to change it, because
        that means work. Naww, you'd rather go to &quot;work&quot; and twiddle
        your thumbs and wonder why the company you work for needs to lay you off
        and you get a grudge for your boss just because you were a lazy ass,
        ever notice that the people who do something get to stay? And that is
        also the only reason you don't like violence on TV when your kids are
        awake because that means you have to like could it be? Change the
        channel or even yechh spend quality time with your family?<p align="center">Not
        like you can make a difference now, if you have kids and read this,
        you're probably too late and you will just have to hope that your
        children will care enough about you to visit you when you're old and
        gray and you're so ugly that nobody wants to see you.<p align="center">Thinking
        all this over you might get depressed, but that's ok, to divert
        attention, do what the president of the USA did: drop a couple of bombs
        and forget about it, the visitors to this site before you probably
        already have.<p align="center">Hi Pyromaniac. :)</td>
