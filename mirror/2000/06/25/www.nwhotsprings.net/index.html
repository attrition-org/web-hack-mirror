        <p align="center">MINDLESS THINKING<br>
        We all surrender each and every day,<br>
        to mindless thinking,<br>
        and a lot of nothing to say.<br>
        With glazy stares<br>
        over crystal rim,<br>
        that no one bares,<br>
        to stop,<br>
        or cares,<br>
        to cease,<br>
        because it's the one and only,<br>
        true communication,<br>
        caused by sound frustration.<br>
        <br>
        Actually we have nothing to say,<br>
        and like the music loud,<br>
        and cover ourselves in a shroud,<br>
        of smoke, dim lights, the crowd.<br>
        And I may be the only one,<br>
        but what is the fun?<br>
        We all sit there and smile,<br>
        while all the while,<br>
        we know it's fake,<br>
        but our rep is at stake.<br>
        And I don't know how much more I can take,<br>
        before I just break.<br>

        MERRY FACTS.<br>
        Controlling the minds of us all,<br>
        we sit and listen and stare,<br>
        because we don't have a care.<br>
        All the time we say nothing,<br>
        and say we had a good time,<br>
        when all contact is lost,<br>
        and it does not seem missed,<br>
        it's a crime.<br>
        When you waste and abuse,<br>
        and watch people with a short fuse,<br>
        ignite on Jerry,<br>
        you're not supposed to be merry.<br>
        Yet we sit slumped over our glistening fad,<br>
        that stayed longer than expected,<br>
        but is dearly wanted,<br>
        for what is has projected,<br>
        upon our brain,<br>
        and corrupted what once was sane.<br>
        With arcane tricks refound,<br>
        the commercial god is crowned,<br>
        and is wealthier than any man,<br>
        whether you're dan, dave or stan,<br>
        you all pay your toll, your tax,<br>
        for twisted facts.<br>

        NEGATIVITY TRICKLES.<br>
        Negativity trickles down my spine,<br>
        oops I gotta grin, "I am fine".<br>
        Every day I stand in line,<br>
        and ask: "how are you today?"<br>
        And I already know what they're gonna say:<br>
        I'm ok.<br>
        I'll ask: "what's up?"<br>
        and hear: "nothing much"<br>
        I guess we're all out of touch,<br>
        with what we really feel.<br>
        and someday we might realize,<br>
        we might idealize eachother,<br>
        when we all feel rotter,<br>
        than the rest,<br>
        but we can't show that,<br>
        we're the best.<br>
