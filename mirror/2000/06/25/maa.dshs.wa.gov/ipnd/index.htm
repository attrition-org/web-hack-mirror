<p ALIGN="CENTER"></font>Welcome to the<br>
2000 Provider Directory<br>
for<br>
Washington State Health Care Programs<br>
</b>(<em>Best viewed at 800 x 600 resolution with frames capability</em>)&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Web site will help eligible Washington residents choose a health plan and provider
with one of four Washington State health care programs: Basic Health, Children's Health
Insurance Program (CHIP), Healthy Options,&nbsp; and Public Employees Benefits Board
(PEBB).&nbsp; The Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) and Health Care
Authority (HCA) oversee these programs. Each program has its own eligibility requirements
and benefits package, and works with health plans throughout the state to offer health
care to eligible residents. In turn, these health plans contract with providers to give
you the medical care you need. </p>

<p>If you are not certain you are eligible for Basic Health, CHIP, Healthy Options, or
PEBB and would like to apply or get more information, please call the toll-free numbers
listed below.</p>

<p>If you are already enrolled in one of the programs, and would like to find out what
health plans and primary care or obstetric providers are in your area for 2000, please
