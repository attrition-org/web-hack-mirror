        <td height="116">The Health Care Financing Administration's vision in the current
        Strategic Plan guarantees that all our beneficiaries have equal access to the best health
        care. Pivotal to guaranteeing equal access is the integration of compliance with civil
        rights laws into the fabric of all HCFA program operations and activities. I want to
        emphasize my personal commitment to and responsibility for ensuring compliance with civil
        rights laws by recipients of HCFA funds. These laws include:</td>

      <tr>
        <td height="173">Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, as amended; Section 504 of the
        Rehabilitation Act, as amended; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended; the
        Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended; and Title IX of the Education
        Amendments of 1972, as well as other related laws. The responsibility for ensuring
        compliance with these laws is shared by all HCFA operating components. Promoting attention
        to and ensuring HCFA program compliance with civil rights laws are among my highest
        priorities for HCFA, its employees, contractors, State agencies, health care providers,
        and all other partners directly involved in the administration of HCFA programs.</td>

        <td height="116">HCFA, as the agency legislatively charged with administering the
        Medicare, Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Programs, is thereby charged with
        ensuring these programs do not engage in discriminatory actions on the basis of race,
        color, national origin, age, sex or disability. HCFA will, with your help continue to
        ensure that persons are not excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of its
        programs because of prohibited discrimination.</td>

        civil rights concerns into the culture of our agency and its programs, and we ask that all
        our partners do the same. We will include civil rights concerns in the regular program
        review and audit activities including: collecting data on access to, and the participation
        of, minority and disabled persons in our programs; furnishing information to recipients
        and contractors about civil rights compliance; reviewing HCFA publications, program
        regulations, and instructions to assure support for civil rights; and working closely with
        the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Office of Civil Rights, to initiate
        orientation and training programs on civil rights. HCFA will also allocate financial
        resources to the extent feasible to: ensure equal access; prevent discrimination; and
        assist in the remedy of past acts adversely affecting persons on the basis of race, color,
        national origin, age, sex, or disability.</td>

        <td height="116">DHHS will seek voluntary compliance to resolve issues of discrimination
        whenever possible. If necessary, HCFA will refer matters to the Office for Civil Rights
        for appropriate handling. In order to enforce civil rights laws, the Office for Civil
        Rights may: 1) refer matters for an administrative hearing which could lead to suspending,
        terminating, or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance; or 2) refer
        the matter to the Department of Justice for legal action. </td>

        customers. We will enhance our communication with constituents, partners, and
        stakeholders. We will seek input from health care providers, states, contractors, the DHHS
        Office for Civil Rights, professional organizations, community advocates, and program
        beneficiaries. We will continue to vigorously assure that all Medicare and Medicaid
        beneficiaries have equal access to and receive the best health care possible regardless of
        race, color, national origin, age, sex, or disability.</td>
