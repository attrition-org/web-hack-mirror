    The Medical Assistance Administration (MAA) Family Planning Program provides family
    planning services and birth control methods to Medicaid eligible clients. Our vision is to
    increase access to and use of birth control methods by low income men and women to
    increase their chances of becoming and remaining self sufficient.</p>
    <p><a name="What's new?"><strong><em>WHAT'S NEW?</em></strong></a><br>
    <u>Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) Pre-Pregnancy Family </u><br>
    <u>Planning Program: </u>Pre-pregnancy family planning exams to women, with family incomes
    at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, are available at 21 family planning
    agencies around the state. The exam includes a medical history, physical exam,&nbsp; pap
    test, pregnancy test, STD screening, contraception counseling, and follow up contact. All
    other medical care, including birth control methods and STD treatment, are not covered.
    The women will need to discuss payment options with the clinic for additional medical care
    or birth control methods. </p>
    <p><u>First Steps/Family Planning Project:</u> Washington State will be adding another
    partner in the community continuum of family planning services. Beginning July 1, 2000
    Maternity Support Services (MSS) staff will begin implement an enhanced family planning
    component into their work with pregnant women. This integration involves completion of a
    Performance Measure. The measure is for these women to have a birth control method in
    place by six weeks post-partum to assist families in planning and spacing children.
    Training for MSS staff&nbsp; is now occurring. Local community combined MSS/First Steps
    and Family Planning meetings to develop a family planning continuum of care and identify
    local networks for follow up care for post-pregnant women are being scheduled.&nbsp; For
    more information, please contact Diane Tiffany at <a href="mailto:tiffandp@dshs.wa.gov.">tiffadp@dshs.wa.gov.</a>

    <p><u>Program for Appropriate Technology in Health-(PATH) Emergency Contraception project:</u>
    &nbsp; Through a unique collaborative agreement with DSHS Economic Services Administration
    (ESA), MAA is contracting with PATH to expand the geographic scope of emergency
    contraception services to rural and undeserved populations of Washington State. This
    project begins June 2000 to run through June 2001. Project goals are to increase the
    numbers of trained pharmacist able to prescribe emergency contraception and promote
    awareness of these services to rural and areas of the state with high rates of unintended
    pregnancy. For more information about this project, please contact&nbsp; <a
    href="mailto:neukomr@dshs.wa.gov">Mary Neukom</a> at MAA or <a href="mailto:jh@path.org">Jane
    Hutchings</a> at PATH.</p>
    <p><u>CSO Profiles: Birth and Unintended Statistics For Community Services Offices, 1990
    to 1997</u>&nbsp; MAA contracted with DSHS Research and Data Analysis (RDA) to provide
    information on birth and unintended pregnancy statistics per DSHS Community Services
    Office (CSO). &nbsp; This CSO specific information is useful for comparing the rate of
    unintended pregnancy to the statewide rate and identifying target populations for follow
    up care and outreach. For a copy of the report, please <a

    <p><u>&quot;Access to Reproductive Health&quot; Project: </u>The Center for Law and Social
    Policy (CLASP) in Washington D.C., selected Washington State as a project participant to
    identify ways that family planning has been incorporated into welfare reform and other
    programs which serve low income families. CLASP looked at what welfare agencies can do to
    improve voluntary utilization of and access to reproductive health services. The goal was
    to identify innovative successful and unsuccessful strategies.A report, describing efforts
    in three states Washington, California, and Georgia is now available from <a
    href="http://www.clasp.org">CLASP</a>.</p>
    <p><a name="What currently exist?"><strong><em>WHAT CURRENTLY EXIST?</em></strong></a><br>

    track with the waiver request. When approved, it will consist of a 5 year Medicaid
    demonstration project that would provide family planning services to men and women with
    incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. The goal is to provide
    family planning services<em><strong> prior to pregnancy</strong>.</em> Proposed beginning
    date for this new program is November&nbsp; 2000. For more information, please contact
