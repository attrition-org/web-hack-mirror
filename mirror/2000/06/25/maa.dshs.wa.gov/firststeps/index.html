    <td>When a woman is determined eligible for First Steps, in most offices, she will be seen
    by the First Steps Social Worker. This person will talk with her and determine her
    family's basic needs, see if she needs MCM and refer her to a local agency (ies) for the
    actual MSS/MCM services. <p>The First Steps Social Worker may also explain to her about
    enrolling in Healthy Options, Washington State's Medicaid managed care program. Most women
    will receive their medical prenatal care through Healthy Option. She will be given every
    chance to enroll in the plan of her choice in order to receive her prenatal care from the
    provider of choice. </p>
    <p>Some women learn about First Steps services when they have a pregnancy test or apply
    for WIC. First Steps has many &quot;entry points&quot;. There is no &quot;one way&quot; to
    get in! To learn more about local First Steps provider agencies, contact the First Steps
    Social Worker in the local CSO or call <strong>1-800-322-2588.</strong></td>
