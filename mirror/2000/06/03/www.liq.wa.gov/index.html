    another .gov defacement... it's not the first it's not the last and I love doing it... Why
    ?</font></small><p><small><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well I think hacking .gov, .mil and
    .edu servers is the most ethical way of hacking... and I say this for several reasons:</font></small><ol>
      <li><small><font face="Comic Sans MS">The government is something bad... everything you do
        against it is good ! Every .gov is EVIL!!!</font></small></li>
      <li><small><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you hack a private company and deface it's web page
        that company will loose clients &amp; money... the .gov has no clients that would pay to
        see some stupid webpage. Actually the government's clients are the taxpayers... but I
        don't think they care about .gov pages... Let's be serious, how many times did you visited
        a .gov site ? I mean for curiosity.. not to hack it or to see someone's hack... No one
        needs .gov pages... except the government of course.. but as I said they are BAD!</font></small></li>
      <li><small><font face="Comic Sans MS">By definition a .gov, .mil or .edu server _should_ be
        secure....</font></small></li>
    </ol>
    <p><small><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ok, here we go... shoutz to:</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Comic Sans MS">BM-Freak [that nasa.gov rulez], LiGHT [hack the
    literature teacher :], n0nam3, H3X0r [that nameserver was already rooted... hehe :-],
    beculetz, RobyS, everyone from #nonstop, ph33r th3 b33r... [.kr rulez... heheheh...
    hacking .kr's is also ethical... nobody needs them either], H3rb and everyone who greet
    us...</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Comic Sans MS">P.S1: Admin, you're security sucks... for problems
    contact me at: <a href="mailto:diablo@privacyx.com">diablo@privacyx.com</a>, btw: the old
    page was backed up as <a href="pentaguard.htm">pentaguard.htm</a> <br>
    </font></small>P.S2: I appreciate the work done by the guys at <a
    href="http://www.attrition.org">www.attrition.org</a> , I also understand that they can't
    check for hacked sites 24/7... however it's a little bit annoying when 2 nasa.govs and
    some .mils aren't mirrored because attrition saws them too late... How about telling us
    WHEN are you checking you're mail for hacked domains... for example.... every day at 8 PM
    GMT... at 7:30 everyone would send his defacement and mostly everything would be
    mirrored... just an idea :) </td>
