<a NAME="gifted"></a><b>What is Gifted?</b></dt>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
There is not one best answer to this question. Researchers don't agree;
thus, the federal government leaves it up to the states to define "giftedness."
The federal definition cites two basic goals of gifted education: to help
individuals realize their potential and to provide society with high-level
talent. Alaska leaves it up to each district to determine how to identify
gifted children and meet their needs.</dt>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
Sitka School District defines "gifted" as one who excels in reading and
mathematical problem-solving, creativity,&nbsp; intellectual ability (IQ),
and project completion. It allows flexibility in the areas of achievement
and intellect for superior performance in reading OR math and superior
performance in verbal OR abstract reasoning on the I.Q.</dt>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="philosophy"></a><b>Philosophy</b></dt>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
The Sitka School District is committed to an educational program that recognizes
the unique potential of the individual student. Gifted services are an
integral part of this commitment.</dt>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
The primary goal of Sitka's gifted services is to provide opportunities
to develop each identified gifted student's potential to meet needs that
are not being fully met within the regular curriculum Those needs can be
in content, process, and/or enrichment. Educational services designed for
students will be differentiated from those of the mainstream curriculum.</dt>

<a NAME="process"></a><b>Identification Process</b></dt>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
What to look for:</li>

<blockquote>Students who exhibit high ability in reading, math, intellectual
curiosity, creativity, and task commitment can be referred to determine
if they have a need for gifted services.
<p>Screening is conducted to identify potentially gifted students. Generally,
students with scores at or above 90% in reading and math <u>or</u> at or
above 97% in reading or math are good candidates for referral for gifted
services evaluation.</blockquote>

<li>
Who can refer:</li>

<blockquote>Parents, teachers, principal, or even the student can refer
for further consideration to analyze a child for giftedness.</blockquote>

<li>
What's next after referral?:</li>

<blockquote>The gifted services teacher will ask the parents for permission
to test their child. If that permission is granted, the evaluation process
begins.</blockquote>

<li>
Testing Process:</li>

<ul>Once parental permission is received to test, the referred child is
tested in achievement (reading and math); IQ, and creativity. If all minimums
are met, parents are notified. The following scores are absolute minimums
and must be met prior to any further consideration:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER WIDTH="80%" >
<tr>
<td>Nationally standardized achievement (PIAT-R, CAT, etc.)
<blockquote>Average of reading and math scores
<br>Reading comprehension or reading total
<br>Math concepts and applications or math total</blockquote>
</td>

<td>
<br>90% or
<br>97% or
<br>97%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Individual Intelligence Score (IQ) (Stanford-Binet, Wechsler, etc.)
<blockquote>Full-scale
<br>Verbal reasoning
<br>Abstract visual/performance</blockquote>
</td>

<td>
<br>125 or
<br>99% or
<br>99%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Torrence Test of Creativity (figural)</td>

<td>200</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If the child did not meet the absolute minimums, he or she may be eligible
for reevaluation after two years. Prior to then, standardized tests may
be re-administered only if the original test is found to have been invalid.
Special Education or Bilingual/Bicultural children will merit further consideration
by the multidisciplinary team even if all score minimums are not met.
<p>The child then begins independent work on a project of keen personal
interest to him or her. This project will be evaluated by the entire multidisciplinary
team for criteria such as project quality beyond the typical age peer,
in-depth handling of the subject, advanced concept, overall excellence,
and detailed workmanship.
<p>The team then determines if the child needs and is eligible for gifted
services education. At that point, the child is entered into the program
and an individual educational plan is developed for that child.</ul>

<li>
Placement:</li>

<blockquote>After a child is identified as gifted, the multidisciplinary
team determines if he or she needs special facilities, equipment, or methods.
If there is a need, the student is entitled to gifted services. A team
consisting of the parent(s), child, classroom teacher, gifted services
teacher, and principal will develop the required Individualized Education
Program (IEP). The IEP will consider the child's strengths to develop goals
and objectives which will further develop those strength areas.
<p>Every three years, the multidisciplinary team will re-evaluate the child's
performance and current educational needs to determine whether he or she
remains eligible for gifted services and whether re-testing is required.
Re-testing or re-evaluation will be done in a given area if the student's
performance indicates a need or if the parent(s) or multidisciplinary team
requests it. When considering an exited student for re-entry to gifted
services, the multidisciplinary team will evaluate if any re-testing is
required.
<p>If the student fails to perform at expected levels prior to the three-year
re-evaluation in either the regular program or with gifted services or
if the student no longer meets placement eligibility, the multidisciplinary
team process is utilized to effect an exit. Or, if a student or parent
voluntarily refuses continued gifted services, an exit interview or survey
will be conducted to seek information for program improvement.</blockquote>

<br><a NAME="options"></a><b>Program Options</b>
<p>Gifted services are based upon an annual IEP which outlines the ways
in which each child's needs will be met. As IEP goals change, so will program
options. Below is a general overview of program options:
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Elementary</li>

<blockquote>A variety of services are utilized, including whole classroom
enrichment provided directly by the gifted services teacher and/or classroom
teacher; small group work with students of similar interests or abilities
based upon identified student's needs; and curriculum modification for
supplemental, adapted, or substitute assignments.</blockquote>

<li>
Middle School</li>

<blockquote>Gifted services are delivered with emphasis on individual needs.
Services are delivered by regular classroom teachers, specialists, and
paraprofessionals. Options can include classroom enrichment, small-group
work and acceleration in a specific subject area.</blockquote>

<li>
High School</li>

<blockquote>A four-year plan is developed for incoming freshmen to address
projected needs toward college and career options. High school options
include electives, acceleration, learning through service, independent
study for credit, career exploration, advanced placement testing, correspondence
opportunities, college credit for juniors and seniors, and mentoring.</blockquote>
