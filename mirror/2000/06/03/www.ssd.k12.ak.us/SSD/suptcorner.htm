<p><a href="SSD.html">Back to Sitka School
District</a>
<p>Welcome to the Sitka School District's web site! Sitka School District
is one of the premier school districts in the State of Alaska, having developed
the reputation for exemplary programs over the past couple of decades.
Sitka is located on Baranof Island and houses 5 schools. There are two
elementary schools; <a href="../Verstovia/Verstovia_Elementary_Schl.html">Verstovia
Elementary </a>and <a href="http://www.ssd.k12.ak.us/baranof/baranof.html">Baranof
Elementary</a>,
<u><a href="http://198.70.233.12/">one middle school</a></u>,
<u><a href="http://198.70.235.50/start.html">one
high school</a></u> and <u><a href="http://phs.ssd.k12.ak.us/">one alternative
school </a></u>which serve a total of 1700 students. Along with the five
schools, we offer a <a href="../Home%20School%20homepage/home%20page/home page.html"><u>home
school correspondence program</u> </a>that serves approximately 55 full-time
students.
<p>While visiting our web sites, don't miss out on our school home pages.
The staff and students have created these pages. Our <u><a href="SSD.html">School
Board Members</a></u> can be contacted by going to their individual web
pages. Along with the School Board Member pages you can find a complete
copy of our <u><a href="BoardPolicy/BoardPolicyIndex.html">policy
manual</a></u>. You can also contact our <u>special education department</u>
if you have questions.
<p>Our <u>Strategic Plan</u> has been in place since June, 1994. It has
received reviews and been updated annually, and the Plan today bears little
resemblance to the original document. Most of the original Action Plans
have been accomplished and the remaining Plans have been updated and rewritten
to reflect current work in the District. The Strategic Plan has been the
blue print for change over the past five years and has propelled the Sitka
School District to a level few thought possible in 1994.
<p>We strive to have communication with the entire <u><a href="http://www.sitka.org/">community
of Sitka</a></u>. With support from the community of Sitka, the Sitka School
District can accomplish anything. We appreciate any input to improve communication
between the community and the schools. Feel free to share you ideas with
us.
<p>John Holst, Superintendent
