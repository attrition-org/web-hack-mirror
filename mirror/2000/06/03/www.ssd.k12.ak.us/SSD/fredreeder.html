<p>I have been a lifelong Sitkan except for college and 4 years teaching
at Ketchikan High School from 1976-1980.&nbsp; I graduated from Arizona
State University with a B.A. in Education with a major in History and minor
in English and Economics.&nbsp; Upon leaving the teaching profession I
returned to Sitka to open my own business in 1981 ("Duds n' Suds).&nbsp;
Recently, besides still being involved with the business, I have been working
for Cruise Line Agencies of Alaska taking care of all of the Cruise Ships
that come to Sitka in the summer.
<p>I have been married to Debbie for 14 years and we have three children;
Keith (12), Gordon (6) and Holly (5).&nbsp; We keep busy with numerous
family activities from skating in the winter to fishing in the summer as
time allows.&nbsp; The kids love to go camping at one of the nearby Forest
Service cabins.
<p>I became a Board member because I felt that there were things that I
could offer the board in the way of my past education experience and my
association with business and the knowledge that I have gained offer the
past 18 years running my own business.&nbsp; I also felt with my own children
attending the Sitka Schools; if I wanted to impact any change I would have
to become involved in the process.
