<UL>Sitka School District Home School Support Program is in its fourth
year of operation.We believe that education may be gained through a wide
variety of experiences and situations, which includes the home and the
community environment as valid and important resources. We believe it is
important to offer choices and the resources and services to support those
choices. We are in the position of offering a bridge between people in
our community who have chosen an alternative to enrollment in the Sitka
Schoools and the traditional school setting. In order to honor the diversity
of the population of Sitka, we have developed a program which allows for
flexibility and options.

<CENTER><B>Curriculum Choices</B></CENTER>

<UL>Curriculum options for children kindergarten through eighth grade include
choices from prepacked curriculums or the option of creating an individualized
program.The Home School Coordinators assist in putting together a balanced
curriculum and are available for consultation on a regular basis.

<P>The majority of our high school and middle school curriculum is ordered
from University of North Dakota-Independent Study. Our credit requirements
are aligned with Sitka High School. Testing for all high school courses
takes place in the home school office.All records and transcripts are kept
in the Home School office and a Sitka School District diploma is awarded
upon graduation. Contact our office for additional information on how high
school classes are handled. Specific responsibilities are outlined for
parents and students.

<CENTER><B>Curriculum Support: Lending Library and Workshops</B></CENTER>

<UL>The Home School Corespondence Program has established a lending library
- a collection of materials covering all topic areas and age/grade levels.
The resources are available to our participants for check-out. Included,
also, are computer software programs, math manipulatives, science material
tubs, etc.

<P>This year's workshops include an art and crafts workshop (parent facilitated),
science workshop, and a writer's workshop (Home School Coordinator facilitated).
Materials needed for the workshops are provided by the office.
