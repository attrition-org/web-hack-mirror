<h3>
Concept of "Community Schools"</h3>
Using schools as hubs for public activity makes sense. Schools are one
of our major resources and investments. What better way to make use of
them than through community activities? Traditional school hours leave
plenty of time to schedule them for other uses. In Sitka, over 65 groups
including the Teen Center, Scout Troops, Little League and the Filipino
Community meet in classrooms. School recreational facilities, including
five gymnasiums, the Blatchley pool and track, and multipurpose rooms,
are scheduled and used by literally thousands of Sitkans each year. Affordable
fees are charged for Community Schools programs with scholarships available
to low income youth.

<h3>
People Power and Community Schools</h3>
The people of Sitka are at the core of Community Schools. Each year, over
30 individuals teach classes and share their skills with the community.
Volunteers coach youth sports and help with family game nights. And many
more people take part in and actively support our programs. Community Schools
also provides ways for people, particularly youngsters, to develop their
skills. For example, youth who obtain life guarding certification at Blatchley
Pool and work there during their high school years can learn leadership
skills while gaining a strong sense of responsibility. These young people
are also encouraged to gain additional certifications obtainable through
the Blatchley Pool. This training coupled with the practical experience
of working with people of all ages, increases their potential for success
in the future.
