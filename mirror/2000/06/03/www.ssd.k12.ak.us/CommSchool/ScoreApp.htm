PARENT COMMENTS<BR>
1994<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The following are comments from parent with children involved in the S.C.O.R.E. program.<BR>
<BR>
	Team building is one of the best aspects of this program.<BR>
<BR>
	My son is learning important information in survival skills as well as having fun with his peers.<BR>
<BR>
	David seems to really enjoy S.C.O.R.E. and has enthusiasm for it.  It's very important for him to be at each meeting.
 I think it has helped his self-esteem and increased his willingness to get away from the TV.  <BR>
<BR>
	This is a good program for the children over the summer months, very educational.  It teaches the kids values
and how to be productive citizens.  Kids think its FUN.  A great program for community as a whole.  <BR>
<BR>
	I would like to see the program extended, i.e.:   Winter Outdoor Education/Survival.<BR>
