         <P>This publication provides glimpses into the classrooms of
         real teachers at various stages of technology integration.
         The snapshots illustrate appropriate and creative uses of
         technology at all grade levels and within different subject
         areas. Contributing teachers name useful software and
         hardware as well as supplementary content-related resources
         such as Web sites and videos. Software and video
         descriptions and a listing of software publishers/producers
         are also included.</P>

         <P>Visit the <A HREF="http://www.ael.org/snapshot/">Curriculum
         Snapshots Web site</A> to order the publication or add your own snapshot. Teachers

         <P>This tool presents a sound progression of data collection
         and decision-making strategies that can increase the
         effectiveness of distance-based or distributed-learning
         instruction. It examines decisions that must be made regarding
         distance-based and distributed learning environments in numbered steps, prompting
answers unique to the
         needs and situations of different institutions and
         learners.</P>

         <P>This regional survey looks into Kentucky, Tennessee,
         Virginia, and West Virginia classrooms to learn how teachers
         in the region use software. The survey includes a review of
         research on technology use in the classroom, descriptions of
         software types, and teachers' responses to questions about
         categories and frequencies of software use.</P>

         <P>This <a href="prod01.htm">CD-ROM</a> and <a

         school leaders recognize, promote, and evaluate effective
         technology use in their schools. Leaders can work at their
         own pace to examine their roles as technology leaders,
         identify barriers to integrating technology into their
         schools, learn strategies to help teachers become more
         accepting of technology, make informed decisions about
         allocating technology resources, and much more.</P>

         <P>In 1999 AEL sponsored a regional competition to identify effective practices in
instructional technology. <a href="best.htm">Twelve schools</a> were selected from numerous
applicants across the southeast region, and the top three were recognized at the National School
Boards Association Technology + Learning Conference in Dallas. This monograph describes
these programs as well as lessons learned and possibilities for replication. It identifies common
elements and emerging patterns, providing insight into the conditions necessary for integrating
classroom technology effectively.</P>
