 Orlando, Florida<BR>
June 13-16, 2000</FONT></center>
<P>
SEIR*TEC is pleased to announce its third <I>School Leadership in Technology
Academy</I>,
a professional development opportunity for teams of educators from the southeastern
United
States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Scheduled for June 13-16, 2000, at the
Holiday
Inn and University at Central Florida in Orlando, the academy will host up to 10 teams
from
schools and districts, helping them achieve goals they have set for using technology to
support teaching and learning.
<P>
The goal of the <I>School Leadership in Technology
Academy</I> is
to support teams of teachers and administrators as they work together on an issue they have
selected as important to technology integration in their school or district. The team
establishes
the focus of their work at the academy and develops a product aimed at resolving the
problem
they identified.
<P>
The academy is based on the Authentic Task Approach (ATA), developed by SEIR*TEC
partner Learning Innovations, Inc. ATA is a task-oriented, professional development
experience
designed to get results! This makes the <I>School Leadership in Technology Academy</I>
different from a typical conference where participants attend many sessions to sample
approaches and obtain information. 
<P>
Using the ATA approach means that once a team's application is accepted, the team is
matched
with a SEIR*TEC facilitator. Prior to arriving at the academy, the team, assisted by the
facilitator, works to answer to these questions:
<P>
  <UL>
       <LI>What technology teaching and learning issue or technology-planning challenge do
we
  want to concentrate on at the academy?
       <LI>Within that issue or challenge, what is the specific problem we want to address?
       <LI>What kind of product or result do we want as an outcome of our work at the
academy?
</UL>
<P>
Sample activities at last year's academy included
<P>
<UL>
     <LI>redesigning existing curriculum to incorporate technology
     <LI>updating district technology plans
     <LI>developing effective plans for professional development</UL>
<P>
There is <B>no registration fee</B> for teams selected. SEIR*TEC provides materials and
resources; school teams must, however, arrange and pay for
transportation, meals, and lodging. A block of rooms is reserved at the
Holiday Inn at the rate of $87.00 per night, single or double. Because space is limited, teams
must apply to attend. A maximum of 10 teams will be accepted.  Hotel reservations must be
made by May 1 to obtain academy rates.
