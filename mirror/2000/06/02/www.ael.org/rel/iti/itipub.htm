  <I>Dissolving the Boundaries: Planning for Curriculum Integration in Middle and
Secondary Schools,</I>
 Rebecca Crawford Burns<BR>
<P>
<B>How committed and prepared are your staff members to implement changes in curriculum, instruction, and
assessment?  What conditions are conducive to implementing interdisciplinary teamed instruction?  How can
you build commitment to curriculum integration and the inevitable changes in schooling that it brings?</B> 
Failure to consider such questions may result in frustrated efforts to integrate the curriculum that have little chance to
succeed.  Before initiating curriculum integration, middle and high school faculties should take time to explore
interdisciplinary teamed instruction and its implications for school change.  
<P>
<B><I>Dissolving the Boundaries</I></B> is a <B>unique professional development tool</B> that can assist
middle and high school faculties with the curriculum-decision-making process.  In 6-12 hours in a group setting, a
school faculty, or other decision-making group, can build readiness for curriculum integration by completing these
tasks: 
<P>
<UL>
     <LI>explore <B>five stages of curriculum integration</B>--comparing and contrasting each to the school's
current approach to teaching and learning;
     <LI>identify <B>benefits</B> and <B>challenges</B> of integration to students, teachers, and community;
     <LI>make an individual and collective <B>commitment</B> to interdisciplinary teamed instruction; and
     <LI><B>establish a plan</B> for how the school might best proceed with curriculum integration.
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>Dissolving the Boundaries</I></B> is <B>research-based</B>.  It reflects current theory about teaching and
learning and is enriched by the wisdom of teachers and administrators who have designed, implemented, and evaluated
interdisciplinary teamed instruction.
<P>
                            The accompanying <B><I>Facilitator's Guide</I></B> provides step-by-step directions for activities,
transparency masters, and participant handouts.  With copies of <B><I>Dissolving the Boundaries</I></B> for each
participate, a facilitator may  use these materials in a professional development setting.
<P>
<B><I>Dissolving theBoundaries</I></B> with <B><I>Facilitator's Guide</I></B>, is $31.00;
additional copies of <B><I>Dissolving theBoundaries</I></B>, $16.00.  Prices include shipping
