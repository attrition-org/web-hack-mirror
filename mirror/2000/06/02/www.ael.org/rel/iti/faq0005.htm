<B>What is the Teaching/Learning Mapping Strategy (TLMS)?</B>

<P>
The Teaching/Learning Mapping Strategy is a tool for achieving standards-based, 
curriculum-focused school improvement.  Building on the work of Heidi Hayes Jacobs (Mapping
the Big Picture, 1997, ASCD), TLMS is a collaborative process that helps teachers
and
administrators develop a picture of teaching and learning across a district or school.  Once that
picture is complete, it reveals areas that need improvement for students to achieve to higher
standards.  Ultimately TLMS aligns curriculum, instruction, and assessment to be coherent and
consistent with standards.
<P>
TLMS also includes a professional development component that helps teachers improve teaching
and learning. In weekly meetings led by administrators and teacher leaders, teachers discuss what
and how they are teaching and how their students are learning. These activities help teachers
achieve the goals of TLMS:  (1) align what and how they teach with specific standards, (2)
enrich instruction by using a variety of teaching strategies that advance equity and excellence, (3)
connect and reinforce learning across the curriculum, and (4) develop classroom assessments that
match learning expectations and predict success on standardized tests. 
<P>
<B>How is TLMS different from curriculum guides or pacing guides?</B>
<P>
Curriculum guides and pacing guides define the <I>curriculum</I>--what we teach--but do not
address <I>instruction</I>--how we teach--or <I>assessment</I>--how we know that students
have learned.  Research shows that alignment of curriculum topics is not enough; change in
instructional practice is necessary if student achievement is to improve.  TLMS activities help
teachers enrich instruction and focus instructional decision making on student performance
results.  
<P>
<B>What actually happens with TLMS?</B>
<P>
Using the TLMS electronic curriculum mapping and design tool, each teacher or teaching team
defines or maps a year's curriculum in monthly "chunks" as it is actually taught.  The completed
maps show at a glance what is taught, when and how it is taught (sample activities), how it is
assessed, and what standards are addressed in every classroom. The maps also identify 
cross-disciplinary connections and potential areas for curriculum integration. 
<P>
At the end of each grading period and again at the end of the school year, teachers and
administrators analyze the school's maps to identify gaps in standards alignment, repetitions of
curricular content, and instructional modifications needed to help all students achieve. During the
summer, a district committee representing all grades and content conducts further analysis,
develops exit criteria for each grade or course, and provides guidelines for revising maps as
needed.
<P>
During the second year, teachers incorporate the revisions into their maps, design instructional
units, implement the newly-aligned curriculum, and assess student achievement data.  The result
is a taught curriculum that matches the written and tested curriculum and that promotes equity
and excellence.
<P>
<B>How much time is required for TLMS?</B>

<P>
Most school districts allow two years for full implementation.  Teachers meet twice weekly in
planning teams with site leader(s); teachers share their instructional successes and problems,
receive feedback and support from their colleagues, and learn from one another.  Teachers also
need to spend some time working on their maps individually.  Additionally, most districts
schedule a minimum of six in-service days each year for professional learning activities related
to TLMS goals.
<P>
<B>How do we know that TLMS improves student learning?</B>
<P>
First, a body of research indicates that when teachers focus on student learning, align what is
taught with learning goals that will be assessed, and use instructional strategies that promote
learning for all students, performance on standardized tests improves.  Moreover, in two school
districts that have used TLMS for one year, student scores on standardized tests have improved
considerably.  For example, a Virginia district now leads the state in percentage point gains in
five of sixteen core areas tested: three of four subjects in eighth grade, third-grade science, and
end-of-course English.  This district ranked in the top ten of gains in six other areas. 
Furthermore, teachers who use TLMS report increased student engagement in classroom learning
and extended use of higher-order thinking.    
<P>
<B>What are the responsibilities of district and school facilitators?</B>
<P>
District and school facilitators are responsible for planning for TLMS implementation at least six
months in advance of implementation.  They must assess their district's progress and needs in
terms of standards-based, curriculum-focused improvement and ensure that proper scheduling
and staffing are in place to support implementation of TLMS.  Site leaders are responsible for
providing structure, facilitation, and support for teachers during all TLMS activities.  They are
also responsible for monitoring the maps to validate progress toward a fully aligned curriculum
and good instructional practice.
<P>
<B>What are teachers' responsibilities?</B>
<P>
Teachers develop individual curriculum maps and unit plans, which they modify on an ongoing
basis to reflect what occurs in their classes.  Many teachers prefer to work with a team.  For
example, first-grade teachers, a middle school interdisciplinary team, or all teachers who teach
tenth-grade English may decide to develop their maps jointly.  Individually, they may choose
different learning activities to meet the needs of particular students, but, collectively, they agree
on the scope and sequence of instruction for that grade or course.
<P>
Teachers of self-contained special education classes map their curriculum in the same manner as
regular education teachers.  Their teaching activities reflect student needs identified in Individual
Education Plans (IEPs).  In an inclusive model, regular education teachers provide curriculum
maps and lesson plans to special education teachers who then modify the maps and plans to meet
their students' needs.
<P>
<B>What are the benefits for teachers?</B>
<P>
All of us are more likely to accomplish desired goals if we know where to begin, where we are
going, and how we will get there.  TLMS provides a road map to help teachers develop a clear
direction for what, when, and how to teach to ensure student mastery of essential concepts and
skills.  Teachers learn from one another as they share successful practices and solve instructional
problems.  Most importantly, teachers experience a greater sense of efficacy as they see student
engagement and learning improve.  
<P>
<B>What are the benefits for superintendents, curriculum directors, and
principals?</B>
<P>
TLMS enables district and school leaders to attain standards-based, curriculum-focused, school
improvement goals.  Collaboration and communication improve as teachers and administrators
work together.  And, because TLMS engages teachers in all phases of the mapping and designing
process, teachers "own" the newly-aligned curriculum and, therefore, have a greater investment
in sustaining the improvements.  The greatest benefit of TLMS is improved student achievement.
