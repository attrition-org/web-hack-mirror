<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><I>The Interdisciplinary Teacher's Handbook: A Guide to
Integrated Teaching Across the Curriculum</I></FONT></CENTER>
<P>
     Stephen Tchudi and Stephen Lafer have written one of the most useful guides to
conducting workshops and institutes. They skillfully combine theory and practice, outlining the
traits of interdisciplinary teaching, describing the qualities of good themes for student
investigation, and suggesting a planning model that respects the need for both structure
(organization and direction) and spontaneity (drawing upon student interests and imaginations).
More importantly, the authors offer many concrete examples of how teachers plan, implement,
and evaluate an interdisciplinary unit, project, or course. Examples include a Thematic Study
Proposal Form, Weekly Lesson Plan for a Thematic Unit, Group Progress Report Form,
Multiple User Journal, and Project Procedure Checkpoints.
 <P>
     Tchudi and Lafer are codirectors of the Truckee River Project, a summer institute for
teachers that focuses on interdisciplinary exploration of issues concerning the western United
States. Their passion for place-based, exploratory methods is evident throughout but particularly
in the second part of the book, where they include many ideas for starting and organizing
interdisciplinary projects. The authors suggest teachers should incorporate into the planning
process local businesses, government agencies, and "people and places with histories and stories
to tell."  Veteran as well as beginning teachers will be informed by the authors' frameworks for
planning a unit and examples of how to organize learning around issues and problems using
questions and inquiry, small group and project work, and multiple resources.
