<H2><center>ITI Research Background</center></H2>
From 1992-94, AEL conducted a research and development project called "Interdisciplinary 
Teamed Instruction: Development and Pilot Test." The findings, published in an August 1994
report, laid 
the groundwork for our present programs and publications.<BR>
<BR>
The ITI study had two main objectives: to determine the effects of interdisciplinary 
teamed instruction on teaching and learning; and to test a professional development 
model for use by schools. Four secondary schools in rural Virginia participated in 
the two-year study.<BR>
<BR>
Project staff worked with teams of teachers and administrators to design and test 
integrated curricula, then researched their effectiveness and redesigned them using 
feedback from students, parents, teachers and supervisors.<BR>
<BR>
The project evaluation included questionnaire surveys, reviews of records and documents, 
institute and workshop evaluation forms, and individual and focus group interviews.<BR>
<BR>
Results included positive reports from participants at all four schools, especially 
regarding professional growth, reflective practice, and staff interaction. Student 
attitudes and performance improved, particularly for lower-achieving students. The 
project's professional development model was rated highly effective. Participants expressed 
interest in using action research, but wanted more training in this area, and described 
conditions that promoted successful ITI implementation, notably administrator commitment and
support.<BR>
<BR>
The report's appendices contain team reports from the four schools, teacher and administrator 
questionnaires, nonparticipant questionnaires, individual and focus group interview 
guides, and completed evaluation standards checklists.
