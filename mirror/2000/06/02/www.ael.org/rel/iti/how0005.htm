<P>
     One of the questions asked frequently about interdisciplinary teamed instruction is "How
do we know if we're really doing it right?"
<P>
     There is no one right way to "do" interdisciplinary teamed instruction. At the same time,
planning teams can design their unit, project, or course to be rich in possibilities; relevant to the
standards learners must achieve for lifelong decision making; and rigorous in the types of
experiences, thinking, and habits of mind that can be developed through interdisciplinary
study. The first question planners might ask is, "Are we exploring an important topic or theme
(often embedded in a central focus or problem), or are we more concerned with 'covering the
book'?"  Next, the planning team might ask, "Do students raise questions and direct the inquiry,
or is it just being 'delivered' to them?" To determine whether the instruction is "working,"
examine the variety of students' in-school and community-based learning experiences. Field
trips, guest speakers, small group activities, multiple knowledge resources, student portfolios,
class discussions, new technologies, culminating events, academic summits, or exhibitions could 
be possible features of  a successful unit.

interdisciplinary instruction goals:
