<Center><font size=5>Two- or Three-Day Workshop<br></font>
<font size=4>Dissolving the Boundaries:<br>
           Interdisciplinary Teamed Instruction</font>
</CENTER><p>
     Participants explore five models of curriculum integration; identify the benefits and
challenges of integration to students, teachers, and community; discuss successful teaching
strategies; outline a unit; practice team building; and develop an <a
href="itiwhat.htm">Interdisciplinary Teamed Instruction (ITI)</a> implementation strategy. 
Each
participant will receive a copy of AEL's Dissolving the Boundaries, a subscription to the ITI
listserv, and a multitude of ideas for successful integration.<p>

     The workshops include the following goals:<ul>

     <li> expand understanding of the models and processes for successful interdisciplinary
     teaming and curriculum integration<p>

     <li> recognize factors that support or impede teamed instruction<p>

     <li> identify team structures that are most appropriate in a particular school setting<p>

     <li> increase capacity for teamwork<p>

<li> outline an integrated unit plan<p>
     
<li> develop an ITI action plan</ul><p>
     
    In three days participants have more opportunities to develop team skills and curriculum
  plans.<p>

  <b>Rebecca (Becky) Burns</b> specializes in curriculum development, professional
development, and change facilitation.  The findings from her two-year research and development
project on curriculum integration, conducted in four Virginia secondary schools, led to the
formation of the ITI program at AEL.  The ITI program provides publications, training, and
electronic networking for schools that are exploring and implementing curriculum
integration.<p>

  Becky has conducted curriculum integration workshops and institutes throughout the United
States and Puerto Rico.  Her conference presentations include the National Conference on
Curriculum Integration, National Education Association's Center for Innovation Annual
Symposium, National Rural Education Association meetings, and American Educational
Research Association conferences.   She is a member of the steering committee of the National
High School Association.<p>

  Becky is a former secondary teacher and curriculum supervisor and has taught at the
University of Charleston and the West Virginia Graduate College.  She is the author of two
books and several articles.  Her chapter on Interdisciplinary Teamed Instruction will be included
in Interdisciplinarity K-16:  Perspectives on Integrating Curricula, an upcoming publication of
The College Board.

These week-long summer events offer intensive training in ITI implementation to established 
teams of educators. Interdisciplinary teams, career-cluster teams, multiple-site 
project teams, inclusionary learning teams, and staff development leaders can all 
benefit from this experience. AEL offers an annual institute, or will
arrange local, on-site institutes. For more information, contact Rebecca Burns at AEL or by
e-mail <a href="mailto:burnsr@ael.org">burnsr@ael.org</a>.
