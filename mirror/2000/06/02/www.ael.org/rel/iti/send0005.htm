<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
 Grafton, Illinois, is located at the confluence of the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. On
Thursday, March 12, 1998, Grafton second graders began a six-week water project by
brainstorming and categorizing ideas about water and displaying the results on a class Web site.
Letters were sent to parents encouraging their participation. Personal  water stories were recorded
and placed in the listening center, along with a continuous-roll "movie" box of illustrations
portraying each child's story. Teachers posed open-ended questions about water to pairs of
children, rotating from question to question, giving all children a chance to write down ideas
about each question. Children wrote their responses on charts for future reference. 
<P>  
<B>Learning Goals and Standards</B>
<P>  
     The application of curricular skills abounded throughout the project through small-group
  investigations or as part of systematic instruction. Students produced several charts about  
water, two class books (alliteration essays and descriptive essays), and three math books
(two-step story problems, number words, and fractions) all of which related to water. 
 <P> 
<B>Introducing the Project</B>
<P>  
     Many children brought in water samples for observation and testing. Liquid measuring
scales, measuring containers, tubs, thermometers, litmus paper, microscopes, pipettes, and other
science materials were used for making discoveries, which were recorded in learning journals.
Students shared discoveries, such as the example below, at group meetings: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Valerie: "If you start with 43 ml. of water and add 1 rock crystal, it goes to 45 ml. Add 1
                    more rock, and it goes to 49 ml.
<P>
                    Phil: "I discovered something about the funnel. If you put in just a little water, it just
goes
                    through, but if you put in a lot, maybe half, it makes a mini-tornado."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  
<B>Community Connections</B>
<P>  
     On March 27, 1998, the teachers and students walked to the local water park, where the 
manager showed us each attraction and explained the construction, water capacity, cleaning  
process for opening day, and other interesting facts. Many of the children swim there during the
summer but had never had the opportunity to explore the park. After the students sketched and
took notes, we picnicked in the adjacent park. Later that week, we took a walk to the Grafton
Water Works, where we took notes as the manager explained the process by which our water is
pumped by wells from an aquifer (underground river) and carried by pipes to the mixing bowl,
settling tank, and filter. 
 <P> 
     Our environmental educator visited our classroom to teach about the three states of water
(liquid, solid, gas) and the  sources of water on Earth. Afterwards, we went outside and
conducted an experiment demonstrating the availability of water in each of the sources. On
Thursday, April 2, she took us by bus to visit the Alton Lock-and-Dam system on the Mississippi
River, about 10 miles from school. A member of the Corps of Engineers was our guide. Then, in
the adjacent wetland area, we used binoculars to observe pelicans and walked to the river bank to
collect mud samples in sieves and look for critters. 
<P>
     A park ranger from the local state park came to the classroom on Friday, April 3. He
talked to the children about various river-related topics and natural resources. He answered the
children's questions and contributed many handouts and posters.
<P> 
Children continuously posed new topics for investigations: 
<P>
<UL>
     <LI>What is the history of the Mississippi River? 
     <LI>What can I learn about sharks, manatees, dolphins, sea horses, and whales? 
     <LI>How does dirty water get clean? 
     <LI>What can I learn about water pollution? 
     <LI>What are the colors of water? 
     <LI>What happens to food when it is placed in water? 
     <LI>Let's learn about all of the pools at Raging Rivers (our local water park).
     <LI>Let's learn about river otters. 
     <LI>How does water work? </UL>
<P>
<B>Teacher-Led Activities and Group Discussions</B>
<P>
Following is a sample discussion about our findings: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bethany: "Even though I didn't need to read for my experiment, I read with
Kylie and took notes. I read in this fish book that fish have gills, and a dolphin is a fish." 
<P>
          Mrs. Schuler: "But, is a dolphin a fish?" 
<P>
                    Stephanie (who is studying about dolphins): "No." 
<P>
                    Mrs. Schuler: "Are their babies born live?" 
<P>
                    Stephanie: "Yes." 
<P>
                    Mrs. Schuler: "Carley, is a dolphin in the whale family?" 
<P>
                    Carley: "Yes. And they breathe on top of the water." 
<P>
                    Bethany: "But wait, Mrs. Schuler, look at this picture. It doesn't look anything like a
          dolphin. Maybe there's a fish called a dolphin, too." 
<P>
                    Mrs. Schuler (who hadn't thought of that possibility and had just commented that
maybe
          we should write a letter to the publisher of that fish book): "Bethany, maybe you're on to
                    something there. Stephanie, could you try to find out in the reading center today?"
          </BLOCKQUOTE>
     
     It turns out Bethany was right; there is a family of fish called dolphins.
<P>     
<B>Team Investigations and Individual Activities</B>
<P>
On Monday, April 6, we began our investigations:
<P>
<UL>
     <LI>Several children chose to study ocean creatures, converting the sizes of models from feet
to inches.
<P>
     <LI>Others studied river wildlife, making their models and paintings the actual sizes. 
<P>
     <LI>Another group worked on a model of the water works building so they could show the
steps involved in making our drinking water clean. 
<P>
     <LI>Still another group interviewed teachers in our building, asking how water works in their
rooms and making a model of the school building for displaying their information. 
<P>
     <LI>Samantha studied pollution, covering our "bulletin board river" with samples of litter
and planning a pollution walk around our community. 
<P>
     <LI>Bethany experimented on the effect of water on foods. 
<P>
     <LI>Katie experimented with the color of water and interviewed people about it. 
<P>
     <LI>Kate made a model of the wave pool at Raging Rivers Water Park. 
<P>
     <LI>Cody created a double filter machine, with real water going first through a sand filter,
                    transferred through straw pipes, and strained by a second strainer before pouring
          into a container. </UL>
<P>

<B>Monitoring Student Work</B>

<P>
     As progress on investigations continued, many children wrote poetry, songs, idioms, and
comic strips about water. Daily journal entries about the investigations were shared at group
meetings, sparking interesting discussions. Group meetings were also used for sharing progress
on
investigations and representations, with children offering encouragement, comments, and
suggestions. 
<P>
     The children studying ocean creatures displayed their models in a large "aquarium" made
from boxes. They  conceptualized creative ways to represent their knowledge, writing a book
about the manatee and dolphin models, and creating posters of the whale and shark models. 
<P>
     The children studying river wildlife hung a plastic see-through mural in front of the
"polluted" bulletin board. A poster telling about the pollution in the river was on display in the
front of the mural. Models of a turtle, otter, and 13-foot catfish hung from the ceiling behind the
mural and various kinds of fish were painted on the mural. On the riverbank stood a blue heron
and a sycamore tree. A female red-winged blackbird sat on her eggs beneath the sycamore, while
a male blackbird flew overhead. The children entered information about the wildlife into the
computer and printed it out for others to read. 
<P>
     The children connected the water works model to the school building model, using real
pipes one of the boys had brought from home (his father is a plumber). They also created a filter,
with layers of anthracite (charcoal), rocks, and sand. A container was placed in the "school
building" to catch the "clean" water that actually ran from the filter through the pipes. 
<P>
     On May 4, we rode by bus to a creek in Elsah, Illinois, (about eight miles away) to study
water, water plants, and wildlife, and look for fossils and geodes. We then went to the pond at
Mrs. Schuler's house for a picnic, followed by fishing, casting molds of animal tracks, and sifting
through mud to find pond life. After each trip, we had a group meeting to share our sketches and
notes, documenting everything on charts displayed in the room. 
<P>
<B>Assessing Student Learning</B>
<P>
     Schuler's Scholars Water Project culminated on Tuesday, May 26, 1998. After Samantha
explained the rules of her planned excursion, we walked around the community with plastic bags
and rubber gloves and picked up litter that would potentially pollute the river. Then we
cooperatively prepared our room for the celebration of knowledge that evening. 
<P>
     At 6:30 p.m., we gathered in the school cafeteria for refreshments and introduced our
experts and visitors. After the second graders performed water songs they had written, the crowd
of about 60 went to our classroom to view the student's products, including the "Waterfall
Aquarium," "River-With-Many Animals," "Experiment Table," "The Raging Rivers Exhibit,"
"The Water-Works-When-the-Water Works," and the computer movie of poems written by the
children. Using their printed river guide, visitors read the information about the fish, turtle,
otter, blue heron, red-winged blackbirds, and sycamore tree. In addition, books about turtles and
others were on display. A bar graph revealed the answers to a survey about the longevity of
turtles and the number of eggs they lay. Another bar graph represented interview results about
the color of water. Venn diagrams compared a person to a red-winged blackbird and a shark.
The water works model displayed a flow chart explaining how our water is cleaned and a
diagram showing the layers of the filter. The "school building" had signs hanging from the
windows telling how water works in each classroom. 
<P>
     At the experiment table, guests watched as various people experimented with water.
Others viewed the chart that showed how water had increased the sizes and weights of some
foods. Another experiment explained how chemicals get into our groundwater supply. Models of
Raging Rivers Water Park attractions were on display, accompanied by informational signs. 
The aquarium contained a hump-backed whale, dolphin, manatee, and basking shark suspended
from the ceiling, with fans creating the effect of slow movement. Each model was accompanied
by a book or poster explaining the knowledge gained during the investigation.  A pictograph
illustrated the size of sea horses, and plastic see-through coral reef murals on the aquarium
created the effect of real water. Sand and three-dimensional models of numerous species of coral
reef adorned the bottom of the aquarium. 
<P>
<B>Teacher Reflection</B>
<P>
     Project work was definitely the highlight of our year, and we were proud, but sad, to see
it end. On the last day of school, we watched segments of our projects on videotape and reflected
on our work. The children are looking forward to next year, when they can visit my new group of
students and tell them about project work. They are now the experts on studying a topic in depth!
