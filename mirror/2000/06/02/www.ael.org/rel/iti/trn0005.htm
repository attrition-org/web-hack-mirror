<P>
     Now is the time to begin planning for spring and summer 2000 professional development. 
Would you like to sponsor an Interdisciplinary Teamed Instruction (ITI) workshop or summer
institute for your district, school, or organization?  AEL offers several <A
HREF="ititrain.htm">training options</A>.
<P>
     Our training is tailored to meet your specific needs related to interdisciplinary teaching. 
In 1999 AEL staff and consultants conducted training for teachers and administrators in
elementary school through college.  The training options include "first steps" in planning for
team teaching; how to's of standards-based, integrated curriculum design; and
advanced sessions on evaluating and revising integrated/interdisciplinary curriculum.  Our
training can be tailored to emphasize team building, curriculum design, instruction and
assessment in ITI, leadership for ITI, or other related topics.
<P>
     Participants in AEL's ITI training receive a copy of <I>Dissolving the Boundaries:
Planning for Curriculum Integration in Middle and Secondary Schools</I> and other print
materials that support teamwork, curriculum design, and effective instruction and assessment
practices.  They also learn about electronic resources such as Web sites, listservs, and videos that
can extend their learning beyond the training event.
<P>
     Participants in AEL's ITI training frequently use expressions like "exciting,"
"informative," "thought provoking," "interactive," and "enjoyable" to describe their experiences. 
Most highly valued is the opportunity to work with and learn from their colleagues.
<P>
     If you'd like to learn more about sponsoring ITI training in 2000, contact Becky Burns at
