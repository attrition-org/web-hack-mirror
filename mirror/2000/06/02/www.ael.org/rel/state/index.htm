The state-focused projects were identified jointly with educators in the states and complement
each state's education initiatives. 

     In <a href="../state/ky/index.htm">Kentucky</a>, the study looks at the development and
assessment of student writing portfolios
     in schools where high percentages of at-risk students have improved their writing portfolio
     scores from the apprentice to the proficient level--the second and third steps in the four-level
     scoring system of Kentucky's new, performance-based statewide testing program. AEL
     seeks to identify factors present in these improving schools that help students reach higher
     levels of success. <p>


     In <a href="../state/tn/index.htm">Tennessee</a>, the AEL study is designed to increase
knowledge about ways to make the
     Internet a part of meaningful instruction in classrooms. The project relies on the best practices
     of a group of exemplary teachers known to effectively integrate the Internet with instruction.
     Documentation of their practices will inform the design and testing of professional
     development processes and materials for use with others. <p>

     The changing role of departments of education across the country--from monitoring to
     providing support and assistance--is the stimulus for the <a
href="../state/va/index.htm">Virginia</a> study. AEL and the state department of education are
working together to develop and test a system the state can use
     to provide school divisions with technical assistance that supports both the implementation of
     Virginia's revised Standards of Learning and the academic achievement of all students,
     especially those in high-need schools. <p>


     Staff is working with the <a href="../state/wv/index.htm">West Virginia</a> School-to-Work
State
Steering Committee to design
     a project that will focus on career guidance strategies in building school-to-work systems in
     local school districts.
