<center><h2>Planning, Research, and Evaluation Unit at AEL</center></h2> 
For more than 25 years AEL has helped schools and communities answer some difficult
<b> QUESTIONS. </b>
<ul>
<li>What does our local community think about the productivity of our schools?  <li>     How
can we do a better job of anticipating local education needs? <li>     What factors are
contributing to the difference in our schools' test scores?  <li>     How well are our teachers and
students responding to our new curriculum?  <li>     Was it worthwhile to send some of our math
and science teachers to a training session on      manipulatives? 
</ul>
Try the Planning, Research, and Evaluation (PRE) Unit at AEL if you need <b>ANSWERS.
</b>
<ul>
 <li>We help schools and communities like yours come to grips with today's difficult education    
 concerns and questions.  
<li>We've been in the R&D business for more than 30 years. Our <a href="./prestaff.htm">staff 
members</a> use methods like strategic planning, surveying, and focus group interviewing to
aid in 
program development and evaluation. 
<li>Our clients include local boards of education, business associations, health and human
services 
agencies, state departments of education, and professional education associations.  </ul>
<p>
Planning is a service provided to help clients: 
<ul>
<li>identify and define problems that are based on clients'  perceptions/data, <li>generate
feasible solution strategies, 
<li>choose and operationalize a strategy or set of strategies for addressing the identified problem,
and
<li>design a mechanism for monitoring and revising the implementation of the solution
strategies to achieve the intended outcome.<p>
</ul>

Planning, Research, and Evaluation staff perceive research to be a dynamic field of careful,
disciplined inquiry that is found in the systemic pursuit of reliable and validated knowledge for
learning. Each <a href="./prestaff.htm">staff 
member</a> holds a unique perspective on research that encompasses a personal  philosophy, a
focus in one or more types of research, an approach to methodologies, and a manner of 
interpretation specific to the researcher.
<p>

The staff perceive evaluation as using reliable and valid data to inform decision-making to
improve 
products and services. We are competent in designing and
writing evaluation copy for proposals, conducting evaluation studies, analyzing and interpreting
evaluation results, and writing or
presenting evaluation findings.<p>

We are professionally trained in the latest planning, research, and evaluation methods.  We are
also educators who understand that each school and community has its own unique set of needs,
problems, and 
opportunities.<p>

We can consult with you by phone, conduct information searches on topics of interest, and
discuss your 
needs face to face. More in-depth work tailored to specific schools and community needs
requires 
contracting with AEL.
