<P>
One difficulty classroom teachers often encounter is finding time to share
successes, questions, ideas, and problems with others.  Another is having on hand the
information needed to reflect about their own practices.  AEL can't solve the problem of
time, but we can help in other ways.  First, we bring teachers together to study a
particular education issue and exchange ideas--face to face or <A
HREF="actlist.htm">on-line</A>.  Second, we provide
state-of-the-art education information.  Using computerized databases and resources on
hand in our facility, AEL's <A HREF="rc.htm">Resource Center</A> helps teachers locate the
information they need.
<P>
For more than a decade, AEL has worked with teachers across the Region to investigate various
education issues.  Each brings a particular expertise to the task:  Teachers contribute their
practical wisdom from the classroom; staff share their knowledge of research and R&D methods. 
Teachers review literature, develop research methods for gathering information, conduct
research, design and conduct classroom interventions, and analyze and summarize findings.  It's a
good model for professional development:  Teacher expertise is recognized and valued; teachers
are given a forum for exchanging ideas and examining new knowledge; the work relates to real
problems in real schools; and teachers engage in hands-on, active learning.
