    The School Services Center serves as AEL's principal response mechanism to the majority of
calls for assistance that come through the Laboratory's toll-free telephone line, by mail, through
<A HREF="mailto:aelinfo@ael.org">e-mail</A>, or through contacts with <A
HREF="../../aeldir.cfm?&query=a">AEL staff</A>.</td>

The Center represents an expansion of AEL's <A HREF="rc.htm">Resource Center</A>, a
central element of AEL's operation since 1966. What began as a small, internal library of
specialized holdings has grown to be "the heart of the Lab", serving as a resource for staff and
clients alike.

<FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="./ribbon/index.htm">Blue Ribbon Schools</A> and <A
HREF="title1.htm">Model Title I Programs</A></FONT>
<P>
With increasing interest in proven programs and practices and in on-line assistance, Center staff 
maintain a database of the nationally recognized Blue Ribbon Schools in Kentucky, Tennessee,
Virginia, and West Virginia.  The database provides contact information, as well as a link to the
web sites of the schools.  Home pages are created for schools that are not already on-line.<P>
AEL also provides current information on nationally recognized Title I programs in schools in
the AEL region.  Contact information for these schools, recognized for excellence in
mathematics and reading, is provided.

<FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="action.htm">Action Research</A> Initiatives</FONT>
<P>
<A HREF="tchrres.htm">Teacher action research initiatives</A> build on decades of experience
in working with teachers. AEL operates the <A HREF="actlist.htm">aelaction</A> listserv, a
free, facilitated forum for sharing questions, insights, experiences, and information related to
action research. The listserv links the wisdom that teachers bring to "net" discussions with
current knowledge from research shared by college/university faculty and list moderators. Other
work in the area includes an annual regional conference for action researchers to provide
opportunities for sharing findings, networking, improving the listserv, and learning more about
action research; and development of a workshop package to guide schools and
colleges/universities in supporting classroom investigations.

<FONT SIZE=+1>Education Information and Assistance System</FONT>
<P>                                
To link educators and school communities to available resources, AEL staff work with other <A
HREF="ta.htm">technical assistance providers</A> funded by the U.S. Department of
Education.  AEL convenes an annual meeting of these technical assistance providers and others
to discuss current activities, regional and state needs, and  technical assistance plans.
