<DD>This past spring, AEL conducted an Education Issues Forum in each of the Region's 
four states. Together, the forums convened 150 principals, teachers, parents, community
members, students, and superintendents from rural, urban, and suburban areas to discuss issues
facing local schools as they strive to provide quality education for all children.
<P>
<DD>More similarities than differences were found in perceptions of schools across groups and
communities.  Diverse conversations took place across the sites, but participants in all four states
talked at length about school-parent-community relationships. All seemed to want improved
relationships seen as key to solving problems associated with classroom disruptions and
incidents
of school violence.  The diverse student population that schools serve today also appears to have
made the delivery of education services a more complex endeavor.  Some schools have created
new education and social service programs to meet diverse local needs.
<P>
<DD>Interest in such issues across the forums is evidenced in these highlights of findings:
<P>
&#183;     Participants felt good about the schools 
in their communities that exhibit a child-centered, caring nature.
<P>&#183;     Parents and educators alike want 
improved school communications and parent involvement.
<P>&#183;     Some schools provide parenting education 
to increase parent involvement.
<P>&#183;     In all four states, the inclusion of special 
education students in the regular classroom was a struggle that some schools had 
overcome, but others viewed as still problematic.
<P>&#183;     While viewing alternative education 
programs as generally successful, participants 
believed they create some problems as well.
<P>&#183;     An increasingly culturally diverse 
population is challenging to educators in Kentucky, 
Tennessee, and Virginia.
<P>&#183;     Participants expressed concern about 
school safety issues; participants perceive that 
steps taken to remedy the problems have met with success.
<P>&#183;     Participants perceived that school 
counselors today are expected to play many roles 
in schools across the Region.
<P>&#183;     Participants seemed to think schools that 
focus on student achievement are successful at improving student performance.
<P>
<P>     The focus on school-parent-community relationships and diverse student populations 
inspired us to choose Respectful Learning Environments as the theme for this issue.
