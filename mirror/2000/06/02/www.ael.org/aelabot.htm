<P>
AEL is a nonprofit, regionally oriented education research, development, and service institution. 
Its 
mission is to link the knowledge from research with the wisdom from practice to improve
teaching and 
learning.  AEL works closely with schools, school districts, and states to develop, test, and refine
practical 
products and processes that address needs expressed by local educators. Resources thus
developed are then 
available to others working on similar problems.<p>

     AEL is governed by a 28-member Board of Directors, made up of educators and others
concerned 
about education in its primary service area:  Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. 
AEL’s 
major work is funded through several contracts and grants from the U. S. Department of
Education.<p>

<a href="./rel/index.htm"><font size=+1>Appalachia Regional Educational
Laboratory</a></font><br>

The Laboratory is one of 10 Regional Labs located across the country.  With educators in the
Region, the 
Laboratory designs R&D-based professional development, develops new processes and products
through 
systematic R&D, evaluates education programs, serves as a neutral convener of state or regional
groups, 
studies the implementation of state policies, and synthesizes and disseminates R&D-based
information.<p>

<a href="./rtec/index.htm">Regional Technology in Education Consortium</a></font>
<br>

The Consortium helps schools integrate technology in their classrooms.  It provides technical
assistance, 
professional development, and technology-related information; and works intensively with one
site in each 
state to study the kinds of assistance that help schools move forward in classroom applications of 
technology.<p>

<font size=+1><a href="./eric/index.htm">ERIC Clearinghouse on Rural Education and Small 
Schools</a></font><br>

     The Clearinghouse is part of a nationwide system of 16 clearinghouses in the Education
Resources 
Information Center.  Each clearinghouse is responsible for adding to the ERIC database
education-related 
works on specific topics.  AEL’s Clearinghouse ensures that works on rural education and small
schools, 
American Indians and Alaska natives, Mexican Americans, migrants, and outdoor education are
included.  
ERIC’s computer-searchable database serves a national audience, making research-based
articles and 
resources available to all.  Besides adding to the database, the Clearinghouse produces books and
research 
summaries and conducts free searches.<P>

<font size=+1><a href="./eisen/index.htm"> Eisenhower Regional Consortium for 
Mathematics and Science Education</a></font><br>

     The Eisenhower Consortium’s work is customized to each state.  It sponsors
professional 
development training that reflects both the national standards and individual states’ curriculum 
frameworks.  It also gives teachers greater access to technology—including training in classroom 
applications of technology—and provides information about opportunities and resources related to
reform.   
The Consortium works with state steering committees of mathematics and science teachers and
educators.   
<p>


<font size=+1><a href="./cac/index.htm">Region IV Comprehensive 
Center</a></font><br>

     The Center helps recipients of Elementary and Secondary Education Act funds improve
teaching 
and learning in their schools.  The Center works in six states with departments of education, local
districts, 
and high-poverty schools to help coordinate and consolidate the services of federally funded
education 
programs.  These programs serve high-poverty, migrant, immigrant, limited-English-proficient,
neglected 
or delinquent, homeless, Indian, and disabled students.
