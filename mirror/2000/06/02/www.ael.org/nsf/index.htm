AEL is proud to sponsor two of the nearly 20,000 projects currently receiving funds from the <a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National 
Science Foundation</a> (NSF).<p>

The NSF is an independent federal agency that promotes and advances scientific programs in the
US.  It  
invests more than $3.3 billion each year to support research and education projects in science, 
mathematics, and technology.<p>

AEL's experimental <a href="./voices/index.htm">Voices of Girls</a> project is one such effort. 
The 
project is designed to promote middle school girls' interest and achievement in science,
mathematics, and 
technology.  The project's two sites-- one rural and one more urban-- will help educators
understand and 
alleviate cultural and environmental barriers to girls participation in science, mathematics, and
technology 
course work and careers.<p>

The second NSF-supported effort at AEL is partnership in the <a
href="arsi.htm">Appalachian Rural Systemic Initiative</a>, a 
consortium of educators, business and civic leaders, and community members working to
promote 
systemic improvement in science, mathematics, and technology for students in rural,
economically 
disadvantaged areas. A variety of education, economic, and community factors influence student 
achievement levels. NSF's rural initiatives support long-term change by encouraging education
change in 
conjunction with economic and community development activities.<p>
