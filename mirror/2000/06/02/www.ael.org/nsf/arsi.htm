</B></FONT></CENTER><P>


A consortium of educators, business and civic leaders, and citizens from six
states--<b>Kentucky</B>, <B>North Carolina</B>, <B>Ohio</B>, <B>Tennessee</B>,
<B>Virginia</B>, and <B>West Virginia</b>--joined
forces to enhance educational opportunities within their rural Appalachian 
communities. The result is the <a href="http://arsi.org/"><b>Appalachian
Rural Systemic Initiative (ARSI)</b></a>, a project designed to improve science, mathematics
and technology education-a key to the advancement of the region.<p>


<H3>Community Involvement</H3>
AEL works with ARSI to engage community support for academic achievement, 
specifically in the areas of science and mathematics. The fabric of every community is 
woven by its teachers, parents, school administrators, citizens, business leaders, and 
health and social service agencies. ARSI and community members in targeted counties 
address locally identified issues and needs. Outreach activities provide community 
members with various opportunities to become actively involved in science and 
mathematics reform.<p>

Perhaps the most basic way ARSI differs from other initiatives is the use of technology to 
improve teaching and learning. Implementing ARSI requires fundamental changes in 
institutional roles and relationships that impact classroom instruction, policy making, and 
the transition to post-secondary education. <p> 

In addition to building upon existing educational initiatives, ARSI draws upon the energy 
and commitment of local, state and regional agencies, business and industry, community 
and civic leaders, and private citizens.  <p>
