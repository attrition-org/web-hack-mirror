<P>  In an age of reform and restructuring, educators are seeking new
models to improve their schools. One approach is to replicate the
qualities, and hopefully the advantages, of a small school by creating
a "school-within-a-school." This approach establishes within the
school a smaller educational unit with a separate educational program,
its own staff and students, and its own budget. Several cities,
including New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago, have experimented
with this as a method for downsizing (Raywid, 1995). This Digest
briefly introduces the school-within-a-school concept, summarizes
existing research on school-within-a-school models, and reviews some
of the advantages and disadvantages.

<P><B>Downsizing and the School-within-a-School Model</B>

<P>   A great deal of research suggests that smaller schools contribute
to student achievement, attainment, and sense of well-being (Cotton,
1996a; Fowler, 1995; Howley, 1994; Howley &amp; Bickel, 2000; Lee &amp; Smith,
1995; Lee, Smith, &amp; Croninger, 1995; Rutter, 1988). To capture some of
the benefits of small-scale schooling, educators are increasingly
looking for ways to downsize, including dividing large schools into
subschools or subunits. This approach is especially useful given the
large number of schools that have been built recently based on the
assumption that "bigger is better." The literature on school
downsizing has been inconsistent in its descriptions of how large
schools are divided into subunits. The most precise definition of a
school-within-a-school model comes from Mary Anne Raywid (1995):

<blockquote>
A school-within-a-school is a separate and autonomous unit
formally authorized by the board of education and/or
superintendent. It plans and runs its own program, has its own
staff and students, and receives its own separate budget.
Although it must negotiate the use of common space (gym,
auditorium, playground) with a host school, and defer to the
building principal on matters of safety and building operation,
the school-within-a-school reports to a district official
instead of being responsible to the building principal. Both its
teachers and students are affiliated with the
school-within-a-school as a matter of choice (p. 21).       </blockquote>


<P>   Large schools have implemented a myriad of programs to downsize or
downscale: house plans, minischools, learning communities, clusters,
charters, and schools-within-schools. Each model differs from the
others on a range of factors, including how separate the subunit is
from the larger institution and how much autonomy it receives to
manage its own education program. The models also differ in terms of
programs and organizational structure and practice (Raywid, 1995).
Some simply group cohorts of students together while maintaining a
symbolic and administrative identification with the larger school. The
school-within-a-school model has the greatest levels of autonomy,
separateness, and distinctiveness. Students follow a separate
education program, have their own faculty, and identify with their
subschool unit. Because the school-within-a-school model replicates a
small school more closely than the other forms of downsizing, it is
most likely to produce the positive effects of small-scale educational
organization.

<P>   A review of the literature suggests that implementing the
school-within-a-school model has met with varying degrees of success
in different settings. The most critical factor for success is a
commitment to implementing the program fully, allowing for complete
administrative separation of the subschool and the creation of a
separate identity (McCabe &amp; Oxley, 1989; McMullan, Sipe, &amp; Wolfe,
1994; Raywid, 1996b). Without full implementation, many of the
benefits of small-scale schooling, such as establishing community and
symbolic identity, cannot be realized. Staff and student support is
also important, and the strengths or weaknesses of a particular plan
may vary over the years with personnel changes. Obtaining the support
of the superintendent, school board, and school principal is also
essential.

<P><B>Outcomes Associated with the School-within-a-School Model</B>

<P>   While considerable data exists on outcomes associated with small
schools, there is much less evidence about outcomes associated with
school-within-a-school programs (Cotton, 1996b). In part, this is
because very few school-within-a-school models have been fully
implemented. A growing body of literature does suggest that downsized
school models can have a positive impact on students, including
improved attendance rates, improved behavior, greater satisfaction
with school, and greater self-esteem (Aschbacker, 1991; Corcoran,
1989; Fouts, 1994; Gordon, 1992; Raywid, 1996a; Robinson-Lewis, 1991;
Tompkins, 1988). Additionally, there is a positive impact on teachers,
who have reported enhanced morale (Fouts, 1994; Robinson-Lewis, 1991).
Some case studies suggest that a school-within-a-school can contribute
to a greater feeling of "community" among participants, which
facilitates student attainment. Greenleaf's research (1995) suggests
that "creating learning communities for young people ... increased
their social commitment to one another and to their teachers, thereby
increasing their personal investments in school" (p. 46). Evidence
related to educational achievement is less clear. Several studies
provide evidence that school downsizing models can contribute to
increased educational achievement and attainment (Crain, Heebner, &amp;
Si, 1992; McMullan, Sipe, &amp; Wolfe, 1994; Robinson-Lewis, 1991). Some
research, however, suggests that subschools produce only moderate or
mixed gains in achievement (Robinson-Lewis, 1991; Jokiel &amp; Starkey,
1972; Morriseau, 1975).

<P>   Other research has identified fiscal and organizational advantages
and disadvantages of the school-within-a-school model. Aside from the
advantages of replicating the qualities of a small school, the
school-within-a-school appears to be a cost-effective approach to
school reform in terms of start-up costs, and in some cases is less
expensive to maintain (Moffett, 1981; Public Education Association
[PEA], 1992a; PEA, 1992b; Raywid, 1995). Among the disadvantages,
research suggests this model can sometimes create divisiveness in
schools because it tends to realign organizational structures and
fracture preexisting relationships. Conflicts can arise concerning
allegiances to the larger school versus the smaller school unit, thus
creating rivalries (Muncey &amp; McQuillan, 1991; Raywid, 1996b). Other
critics maintain that subschool groupings can lead to inequitable
tracking if only one population is targeted for a subschool (Raywid,
1996a; McMullan, Sipe, &amp; Wolfe, 1994). Another critique argues that
the school-within-a-school model may negatively affect school
coherence and the role of the principal, two areas of concern in the
literature on effective schools.

<P><B>Conclusion</B>

<P>   The school-within-a-school model may be an effective and affordable
way to capture the benefits of smaller-scale schooling within larger
school buildings. While research results are limited, the
school-within-a-school model has the potential to contribute to a
greater sense of student well-being, a sense of student community, and
higher student achievement and educational attainment. This model
seems to hold promise especially for disadvantaged students, who are
affected positively by smaller schools but are more likely to attend
larger schools (Jewell, 1989; Lee &amp; Smith, 1996). Because a subschool
model can be adopted in an existing building structure, it is a
cost-effective approach to school reform; however, the challenge lies
in successful implementation. As Raywid (1985) observed, "The major
challenge to schools-within-schools has been obtaining sufficient
separateness and autonomy to permit staff members to generate a
distinctive environment and to carry out their own vision of
schooling" (p. 455).
