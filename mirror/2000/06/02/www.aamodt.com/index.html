<p align="center">When you get hit by a blast from the past you'll realize you
didn't become what you wanted.</p>

<p align="center">Admin: mail me and I'll tell you what's wrong</p>

<p align="center">SORRY.<br>
Computer world, you've taken everything I hold dear.<br>
Sister, you destroyed me, my feelings,<br>
and now I can go on no more.<br>
I am but a shadow of myself,<br>
a figment of my imagination.<br>
<br>
I weep over sad sorrow,<br>
over why things are,<br>
like they are.<br>
How they could've been,<br>
and should've been.<br>
<br>
My heart is heavy,<br>
and weary,<br>
and fights no more.<br>
Like a old man,<br>
I carry my soul.<br>
<br>
And in the progress,<br>
soul, you kill what<br>
is left of the things<br>
you hold dear.<br>
Eyes closing for this,<br>
<br>
I must admit:<br>
this troubled world,<br>
has left me broken.<br>
I lost the fight,<br>
and now I've lost the battle.<br>
<br>
Give up my body shouts,<br>
as I type these last words.<br>
For you will see no more of me.<br>
Give up my heart screams,<br>
so I will, but not without saying:<br>
Mom, I'm sorry.<br>
			Firefly</p>
