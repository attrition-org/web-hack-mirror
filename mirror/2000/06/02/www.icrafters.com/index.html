<p align="center">NINE MONTHS<br>
<br>
                                  After nine months a baby was born,<br>
                              And it's name was hate, and it's heart was torn,<br>
                                  never to be seen a smile on the face,<br>
                             Of the men waiting so long, in this goddam place.<br>
<br>
                                   God help the world, if it only knew,<br>
                                What hate would become, if it ever grew,<br>
                                    Into an adult, and then got free,<br>
                               To surely destroy the whole world and all me.<br>
<br>
                                 For, after the beasts had had their way,<br>
                                  Lied and deceived to lock men away,<br>
                              The Magistrates, fine, all turned their blind eyes,<br>
                               It's enough to make prison chaplains all cry!<br>
<br>
                                 Month after month they stay on remand,<br>
                                Listen in mystery over conspired bad plans,<br>
                                  Never allowed one word in Defence,<br>
                            The legal system, here, just don't make much sense.<br>
<br>
                               So locked up these men, at county's expense,<br>
                                  Guilty or innocent, they sit on a fence,<br>
                                 Awaiting their trials in some distant day,<br>
                              When men either walk free, or get thrown away.<br>
<br>
                               After nine months inside, away from the sky,<br>
                             The birds and the trees and the friendships that die,<br>
                               The children, the life and the lovers won't wait<br>
                              And innocent and guilty have hearts full of hate<br>
<br>
                                        Cardiff Prison 1991&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                                         The Cell<br>
<br>
                                The cell was cold, dark, empty and bare.<br>
                         The walls screamed to themselves - there was nobody there.<br>
                             The bars in the window stood firmly and strongly.<br>
                                  The cell was alone, rightly or wrongly.<br>
<br>
                                 The door to the cell was locked up tight.<br>
                                  It stayed that way all day and all night.<br>
                                   No-one came in to this lonely cell,<br>
                            To make sure the walls and the windows were well.<br>
<br>
                                  The cell, itself, was just doing it's time.<br>
                                It could have been your cell, or even mine.<br>
                                  It waited the years just doing it's best,<br>
                                  Wanting for little, but a prisoner guest.<br>
<br>
                            One day, the door was opened, by a man with a key.<br>
                                Even then this one cell never really felt free.<br>
                                 The warder looked in, said "Is all OK?",<br>
                               Slammed the door shut and just went away.<br>
<br>
                                But this cell was so lucky, if only it knew,<br>
                                For amongst so many it was one of a few.<br>
                              For thousands of others were imprisoning men,<br>
                                 Bleeding their hearts out, again and again<br>
<br>
                                               .&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                               The cell next door, which was much the same,<br>
                                  One man inside it, I forget his name.<br>
                                One night the cell door was finally banged.<br>
                              Next morning the man was found to be hanged.<br>
<br>
                                        Cardiff Prison, 1991.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                                 Inside these Walls<br>
<br>
                              Can't Stand it! Can't stand it! No more at all!<br>
                            In a Universe so big, I'm just alone and so Small,<br>
                             Can't Stand it, no more, inside these four walls!<br>
                               For Love that is Limited is No Love at all!<br>
<br>
                               There's No-one to see, to hear or to smell,<br>
                                   No-one to whom my story to tell.<br>
                               Somewhere is Heaven, but this sure is Hell.<br>
                                 Crying alone in a Pathetic Small Cell.<br>
<br>
                             I reach out through Letters I sent out each Day,<br>
                              Searching for Love in a Written-down Way,<br>
                             Not knowing in here how much longer I'll stay,<br>
                            There's no Sitting Quietly and no Running Away.<br>
<br>
                             The Walls are so Solid and Lifeless, and Thick,<br>
                                The World outside them is terribly Sick,<br>
                             Sleep passes the Time, Please Let it Pass Quick!<br>
                            Put a Smile on the Face, and Let the Clock Tick.<br>
<br>
                             I'll Stand it! I Stand it! And the Day will come,<br>
                          When the Time I've spent here will be Over and Done,<br>
                         And the Walls will collapse, and then who will have Won?<br>
                        Who'll see how much life inside walls can be devoid of Fun?<br>
<br>
                           This Prison breeds Hate, for the Judge with the Key.<br>
                               The Man so Upright and Pathetically Free,<br>
                            Won't Open his Heart and my Door, and me Free&nbsp;<br>
                               Back to the World Full of Hate that I see.<br>
<br>
                                But Who can Stand it, I know not of any.<br>
                               In Company Daily of Sad Faces of Many.<br>
                             Split from their Lives-Loves and All until when<br>
                              Their Sentences Pass and Conspiracy Ends.<br>
<br>
                              Can't Stand it? I'll Stand it! And on I will go,<br>
                             And where will it take me, I really don't know!<br>
                              As Society insists on it's Pathetic Law Show,<br>
                             To Lock up the People who just want to Glow.&nbsp;<br>

<br>
Monkey On The Bench<br>
<br>
                            We looked up, at the bench, and there sat a Monkey;<br>
                               Scratching it's head as if trying to understand.<br>
                           "Why is there so much crime, throughout my sad land?"<br>
<br>
                              The Prosecutor said "These men here are Evil!".<br>
                               The Monkey nodded it's head, as if to agree.<br>
                                 "Why should Monkey let evil men free?"<br>
<br>
                             The Defence Lawyer, he said, "I concede naiveté!"<br>
                               The men in the dock just looked on confused.<br>
                               The Laws of the Courtroom are daily abused.<br>
<br>
                         "We need more time to convict them." said the Beast in Blue<br>
                             "It we hunt hard," he said, "we might find us a case,<br>
                                  To lock them away in utter disgrace"<br>
<br>
                              The men, you see, had God's Herb Seed taken,<br>
                               And grew a fine crop of the peaceful Weed.<br>
                              A crime without victims, yet men won't be freed.</p>
