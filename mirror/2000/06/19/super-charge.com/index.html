    <p><font size="2">Where are all these stupid people from<br>
      and how did they get to be so dumb<br>
      Bred on purple mountain range<br>
      Feed amber waves of grains<br>
      To lesser human beings, zero feelings<br>
      <br>
      Blame it on human nature, man's destiny<br>
      Blame it on the greediocracy<br>
      The fear of God, the fear of change, fear of truth<br>
      <br>
      Add the Bill of Rights<br>
      Subtract the wrongs, there's no answers<br>
      Memorize and sing<br>
      Star spangled songs, when the questions<br>
      Aren't ever asked<br>
      Is anybody learning from the past<br>
      We're living in united stagnation<br>
      <br>
      Father what have I done.<br>
      I took that 22.<br>
      A gift for me from you to bed with me each night.<br>
      Kept it clean polished it well.<br>
      Cherished every cartridge every shell<br>
      <br>
      Down by the creek under brush under dirt<br>
      There's a carcass of my second kill<br>
      Down at the park under stone under pine<br>
      There's a carcass of my brother William<br>
      Brother where have you gone to I swear<br>
      I never thought I could I see so many times<br>
      They told me to shoot straight, don't pull<br>
      The trigger squeeze, that will insure<br>
      A kill, a kill is what you want<br>
      To kill is why we breed<br>
      <br>
      The Christians love their guns the church and NRA<br>
      Pray for their salvation<br>
      Prey on lower faiths<br>
      The story book's been read<br>
      And every line believed<br>
      The curriculum's been set<br>
      Logic is a threat<br>
      Reason searched + seized<br>
      <br>
      Jerry spent some<br>
      Time in Michigan<br>
      A 20 year vacation<br>
      After all he had a dime<br>
      A dime is worth a<br>
      Lot more in Detroit<br>
      A dime in California<br>
      Just a 20 dollar fine<br>
      Jerry only stayed<br>
      A couple months<br>
      It's hard to enjoy<br>
      Yourself while<br>
      Bleeding out the ass<br>
      Asphyxiation is<br>
      Simple and fast<br>
      It beats 17 fun years<br>
      Of being someone's bitch<br>
      <br>
      Don't think<br>
      Drink your wine<br>
      Watch the fire burn<br>
      His problems not mine<br>
      Just be that model citizen<br>
      <br>
      I wish I had a schilling for every senseless killing<br>
      I'd buy a government. America's for sale and<br>
      You can get a good deal on it and make a healthy<br>
      Profit, or maybe tear it apart you start with<br>
      Assumption, that a million people are smarter than 1<br>
      <br>
      Serotonin's gone she gave up drifted away<br>
      Sara fled though process gone<br>
      She left her answering machine on<br>
      The greeting left spoken sincere<br>
      Messages no one will ever hear<br>
      <br>
      10,000 messages a day a million more transmissions lay<br>
      Dead victims of the laissez faire 10,000 voices<br>
      100 guns, 100 decibels turns to one, one bullet<br>
      One empty head now with serotonin gone<br>
      <br>
      The man that used to speak<br>
      Performs a cute routine.<br>
      Feel a little patronized.<br>
      Don't feel bad. They found<br>
      A way inside your head<br>
      And you feel a bit misled.<br>
      It's not that they don't<br>
      Care. The television's<br>
      Put a thought inside your<br>
      Head like a Barry Manilow <br>
      Jingle I'd like to teach the<br>
      World to sing in perfect<br>
      Harmony a symphonic blank<br>
      Stare. It doesn't make you care.<br>
      Not designed to make you care.<br>
      They're betting you wont care.<br>
      <br>
      They'll place a wager on your greed.<br>
      A wager on your pride<br>
      Why try to beat them when a million others tried<br>
      <br>
      We are the whore.<br>
      Intellectually spayed<br>
      We are the queer<br>
      Dysfunctionally raised<br>
      <br>
      One more pill to kill the pain,<br>
      One more pill to kill the pain<br>
      One more pill to kill the pain,<br>
      Living through conformity<br>
      One more prayer should keep me safe.<br>
      One more prayer to keep us safe<br>
      One more prayer to keep us safe<br>
      There's gonna be a better place<br>
      <br>
      Lost the battle lost the war lost the things<br>
      Worth living for lost the will to win the fight<br>
      One more pill to kill the pain<br>
      The going gets tough the tough get debt<br>
      Don't pay attention pay the rent our next of kins<br>
      Pay for your sins a little faith should keep us safe<br>
      <br>
      Save us<br>
      <br>
      The human existence is failing<br>
      Resistance essential. The future<br>
      Written off. The odds are astronomically<br>
      Against us only<br>
      Moron and genius would fight a<br>
      Losing battle against the super<br>
      Ego when giving in is so damn comforting<br>
      <br>
      And so we go on with our lives we<br>
      Know the truth but prefer lies<br>
      Lies are simple. Simple is bliss. Why<br>
      Go against tradition when we can<br>
      Admit defeat. Live in decline. Be there<br>
      Victim of our own design<br>
      With status quo built on suspect.<br>
      Why would anyone stick out their<br>
      Neck fellow member of club<br>
      We've got ours. I'd<br>
      Like to introduce<br>
      You to our host<br>
      He's got his and I've<br>
      Got mine. Meet<br>
