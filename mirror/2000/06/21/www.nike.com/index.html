Notes:

This was not a typical defacement. This was a DNS hijacking. There is not enough 
evidence to determine at what level the DNS poisoning took place 
(ie local DNS or Network Solutions).

We decided to mirror this defacement because a) Nike is a high profile company 
b) there was a degree of "hacking" involved whether it be social engineering 
or a server compromise and c) there was actually a political message on the
defacement that had to do with the company whose site was defaced.

Truly a rare occurance these days.
