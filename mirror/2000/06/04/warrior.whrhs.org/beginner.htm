    <small>This area of the internet is called the World Wide Web, sort of like a giant spider
    web connecting billions of computers across the world. It is the Graphical User Interface
    that makes it attractive and easy for users. It is truly global in scope and you seldom
    know if a link is down the block or across the world. Basically, the WWW is a great
    directory linking &quot;pages&quot; of similar interests. Most people use a search engine
    to help locate and qualify links to areas of interests. There are many companies on the
    internet that provide these services and many new ones emerge weekly. Other components of
    the Internet include FTP (file transfer protocol), Telnet, Gopher and IRC. The only real
    constant on the internet is that it is constantly changing. Now that we have completely
    confused you, here are a few guidelines that might help you experience the &quot;Web&quot;
    in a positive way. </small></strong></font><hr>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000080"><strong><small>1. Always have a list of subjects
    or companies that you are looking for. It is easy to get sidetracked on the web. Here at
    school the browser starts at our &quot;home page&quot; and you travel from here. You can
    always go back to a page you have already viewed by hitting the BACK button on the tool
    bar. You can also get back to our home page by hitting the HOME button on the tool bar.</small></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000080"><strong><small>2. Allow enough time to research
    several sources of data. You seldom accomplish much in a few minutes. Sites with large
    graphics can take several minutes to download. *If you are in a hurry, turn off the
    &quot;download pictures&quot; option in the View/Options menu.</small></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000080"><strong><small>3. Write down the URL (Universal
    Resource Locator) of sites that you find in articles or on the web so that you can find it
    again later. I try to keep a small notebook with me when I surf. Generally, you do not
    have to type the http:// part of the address each time, your browser will do that for you.</small></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000080"><strong><small>4. Use search engines to speed your
    search, you can just hit the SEARCH button on the tool bar to find a list of search
    engines or just go to the ones you like, many sites link to their favorite search engines.
