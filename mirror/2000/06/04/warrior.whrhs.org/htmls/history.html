<p><font color="#000080" face="Verdana">The Watchung Hills Regional school district was
formed in 1955 as a bell-wether program for academic excellence. The district currently
serves Watchung Borough, Green Brook, Warren and Long Hill Townships; communities of
business and professional families who commute to nearby research and corporate complexes
and the area cities and universities. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Verdana">The three ridges of the Watchung Mountains and
I-78 span the heavily wooded 32 square mile district, 25 miles Southwest of New York City.
Modern connecting units of the 85 acre campus serve 1140 students in grades 9 - 12. </font></p>
