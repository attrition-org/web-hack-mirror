    <td>wooow... I got AccessToSpace ? that's kewl... so what can I do now ? can I speak to
    aliens ? or can I use your satellites to spy Jennifer Lopez's bedroom ? <p>Anyway what the
    fuck am I talking about ? It's 3 am in the morning and I'm reading some stupid admins
    e-mail (Admin: relax, no not your mails.. I haven't read your mails yet :))... In other
    words: the perfect time to deface a .nasa.gov... btw: you should know that this host is
    totally owned by Pentaguard... it was used as a BNC server by BM-Freak, n0nam3 rehacked it
    for no apparent reason and I deface it now cause I got bored by it... Mhhm... in may we 6
    owned&nbsp; nasa.govs:<ol>
      <li>imdc.nasa.gov</li>
      <li>acquisition.jpl.nasa.gov</li>
      <li>cotserver.lerc.nasa.gov</li>
      <li>zeta.lerc.nasa.gov</li>
      <li>standards.nasa.gov</li>
      <li>accesstospace.nasa.gov</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Unfortunately some of them (zeta.lerc.nasa.gov and standards.nasa.gov where not
    mirrored by attrition... ooh well... who cares :). I'm not braging... I just wanted to
    point out how lame are these servers... WTF ? nasa.govs _must_ be secure servers... right
    ? After all they got the money for this... they should have the skillz for this (if NASA
    doesn't have specialists.... then who does ?).. but I guess they are too lame to care
    about security... </p>
    <p>Shoutz goes out to: PentaGuard and everyone who greet/support us... I'm lazy to wrote
    shouts</p>
