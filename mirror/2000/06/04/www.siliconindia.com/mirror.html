<br><font size=+0>In an interview with the CNN on the occasion of the 20th
anniversary of its founding,</font>
<br><font size=+0>Chief Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf said: "I am
a man of peace irrespective</font>
<br><font size=+0>of the fact that i don a uniform." Pakistan wants peace
in South Asia but the world must</font>
<br><font size=+0>understand it is not possible without settlement of the
core issue of Kashmir, he said.</font>
<br><font size=+0>"We have realized that the Kashmir dispute is the core
issue," and the daily exchange</font>
<br><font size=+0>of firing on the Line of Control where people are dying
is confronting the two countries.</font>
<br><font size=+0>General Musharraf repeated his readiness to talk to India
"anywhere, anytime", saying</font>
<br><font size=+0>that it was his commitment. "And, I mean it."</font>
<br><font size=+0>He said Indian nuclear doctrine was offensive in nature
while Pakistan's doctrine was</font>
<br><font size=+0>defensive as the latter had only ensured "the credible
minimum deterrence in South Asia."</font>
<br><font size=+0>He said whenever he thought of peace in the region, it
was Kashmir issue which came</font>
<br><font size=+0>to one's mind. This is the central issue which bedevils
relations between the two countries.</font>
<br><font size=+0>The chief executive said in held Kashmir, it was not
terrorism but an indigenous freedom</font>
<br><font size=+0>movement. It was an issue of gross human rights violations,
he said. Indian troops must</font>
<br><font size=+0>stop all the atrocities in occupied Kashmir, he said.</font>
<br><font size=+0>Replying to a question, the chief executive said it was
India which conducted nuclear</font>
<br><font size=+0>tests first. In fact it conducted its first test in 1974
calling it a peaceful test. "I fail to</font>
<br><font size=+0>understand how it could be a peaceful test. Nuclear test
is a nuclear test," he observed.</font>
<br><font size=+0>India tested first and Pakistan responded.</font>
<br><font size=+0>Replying to a question regarding terrorism in Kashmir,
the chief executive said there</font>
<br><font size=+0>is no terrorism in Kashmir, "It is a freedom struggle.
People of Kashmir have risen</font>
<br><font size=+0>against India and I would ask India to stop its atrocities
against the people of Kashmir</font>
<br><font size=+0>and human rights violations and then start a dialogue."
He said reciprocity is involved</font>
<br><font size=+0>in it. He said: "We are for reduction in tension across
the Line of Control but we</font>
<br><font size=+0>are also for reduction of atrocities by the Indian troops,
let these both take place."</font>
<br><font size=+0>He made it clear that Pakistan wanted peace with honour
and dignity and would</font>
<br><font size=+0>never compromise on its sovereignty.</font>
<br><font size=+0>General Musharraf urged the Cable News Network (CNN)
to play its vital role in</font>
<br><font size=+0>projecting Pakistan in its true colour and perspective.</font>
<br><font size=+0>He regretted that the perception of Pakistan to viewers
and the people who see</font>
<br><font size=+0>Pakistan through media is very different from reality.</font>
<br><font size=+0>"Give Pakistan a very balanced portrayal which we deserve."</font><font size=+0></font>
