Midian and Christian start things off with Midian pounding on Christian as the match finally gets underway.  Gangrel is tagged in, but Midian still keeps some control of the match before Bradshaw is tagged in and Gangrel and Bradshaw go toe to toe exchanging blows.  The Brood is able to get the upperhand, briefly, with a double suplex by Edge and Gangrel on Bradshaw who ends up just shaking it off and tagging in Faarooq who after taking solid control of the match, tags back in Midian who goes at it with Edge.
<p>
Edge has been in the ring for sometime now, and is trying to get to his corner to make the tag but Midian prevents him from doing so.  Edge is clearly tired out and needs to make the tag.  Gangrel trys to interfere and help out Edge but his stopped by the Referee.  Midian takes a break and nails Gangrel and Christian, while Edge stumbles into the Acolytes corner and is met by Bradshaw who knocks him to the mat.

Al Snow is making his way to the ring, along with Head, for this Hardcore Title Match.  Snow has had numerous title matches for this Hardcore Title, but has yet to capture the gold.  Hardcore Holly is making his way to the ring, along with the Hardcore Title as he poses for the crowd.  Holly starts things off by nailing Snow with the Hardcore Title and goes for a pinfall but only gets a 2 count (a very quick 2 count at that).  Snow then recovers and is able to throw Holly out of the match after being whipped into the ropes.  Snow starts pounding on Holly on the outside of the ring, but Holly is able to counter things by whipping Snow into the ringsteps.
<p>
Snow is already busted open as Holly nailed him in the face with a jug of water and busted him open!  The two men fight into the crowd, before Holly throws Snow back over the guard rail and into the ringside area.  Neither man keeps the upperhand long, as Snow comes back and nails Holly with a moonsault off the guard rail!  Snow rolls Holly back into the ring and starts beating him with a hockey stick before rolling back out of the ring and pulling a table out from under it!  As Snow starts to setup the table in the corner, Holly recovers and nails Snow with the hockey stick and then he continues setting up the table as Snow rolls back to the outside with Holly fast behind him and Snow nails Holly with a baking pan.  Snow goes for a suplex on the outside, but it is countered and Snow is the one that ends up being suplexed on the concrete as the two men then fight up the entranceway and into the back of the arena.
<p>
The two men fight to the outside, using automobiles and anything else they find as weapons as they fight in the back parking lot of the arena.  They fight up some stairs on the outside, before Snow falls into a dumpster completely filled with trash and Holly joins him and goes for a pin attempt on top of the trash!  He only gets a 2 count as the two fight back down and Holly almost throws Snow thru the passenger window of a car.  They then fight into one of the television trucks on outside of the building as one of the television crew trys to duck for cover before Holly is thrown onto the roof of a car and Snow drops the elbow on him as the roof of the car is crushed inward!  The two then fight back into the building and down towards ringside once again.  Snow and Holly go back into the ring, and Snow nails Holly with a frying pan to the head but is slow to make the cover and only gets a 1 count.
<p>
Snow then sets up Holly on the table that was setup earlier and he makes his way to the toprope but Holly rolls off the table and knocks Snow off balance.  Holly then joins Snow on the toprope and sets him up for a superplex! A SUPERPLEX THRU THE TABLE!!!  OUCH!!!  Both men are out.  Holly is able to put his arm over Snow for an attempted cover but Snow kicks out!  Snow nails Holly with Head and makes the pinfall to win the Hardcore Championship!  <b>Winner:</b> Al Snow wins the Hardcore Title.
<p>
<b>WWF Intercontinental Title Match<br>The Godfather vs. Goldust</b><br>
Goldust is introduced first and is making his way to ringside along with the returning Blue Meanie!  Meanie gets on the mic, "For all the men who wish they could be me, and all the women who came to see me.... are you ready for the grind?" as Meanie does the Sable grind as The Godfather is introduced, minus the hoes as the crowd boos!  The Godfather then points to the ring entrance and out comes 5 hoes!  The Godfather and the hoes pose in the ring, as The Godfather gets the mic to the crowds approval, "It's time once again for everybody to come aboard the hoe train!"  The Godfather is getting a great reception from the crowd.
<p>
"Now this, JR, is sports entertainment!," was Lawlers response to it all as the match was finally set to get underway.  Goldust starts things off right away, attacking The Godfather as the bell rang but The Godfather was able to nail a series of clothesline along with a back body drop to keep Goldust from mounting any serious offense.  Goldust rested on the outside with Blue Meanie while The Gofather had the entire arena chanting, "We Want Hoes!"
<p>
Goldust clothesline The Godfather from behind, knocking him over the toprope and to the outside and allowing Meanie to nail him with series of forearms and stomps to the back before being rolled back into the ring and back to Goldust who nails him with a clothesline and as Meanie distracted the Ref, Goldust went to nail The Godfather with some powder but it was blocked and knocked into his own eyes.  As Goldust was blinded, he accidently nailed the Blue Meanie... The Godfather then leads Goldust back to Meanie as a blind Goldust sets Meanie up for Shattered Dreams while The Godfather sits back and laughs!  Goldust nails him in the crotch and then the Godfather nails Goldust with a kick to the chest and goes for a cover but Meanie interferes and accidently nails Goldust!  The Godfather then nails Goldust and Meanie and nails Goldust with the Death Valley Driver for the victory! <b>Winner:</b> The Godfather retains the Intercontinental Title!
<p>
<b>New Age Outlaws vs. Jeff Jarrett and Owen Hart</b><br>
"Oh you didn't know?  Your ass better call somebody!"  The New Age Outlaws make their way down to the ring, back together again in a tag situation after both have gone on their own winning singles titles on the way.  This match will determine the #1 Tag Team Contenders, with the winner receiving a World Tag Team Title shot this Thursday on UPN during the first broadcast of WWF Smackdown.  Road Dogg does his famous ring introduction as the crowd screams it along with him.  Double J and Owen Hart are then introduced with Debra, who is wearing nothing but a bikini and a small red jacket as she poses for the crowd.
<p>
Road Dogg gets back on the mic and to the crowd delights, tells Debra to show her "puppies" as Owen Hart covers her up and stops her from doing it.  Road Dogg then tells her to let her do what she wants, but again Owen Hart stops her from doing it.  As Billy Gunn is about to moon Hart and Double J, they attack the Outlaws and start things off right away by taking control of the match as the bell rings.
<p>
The Outlaws finally get some offense in as Road Dogg takes control of the match against Jeff Jarrett as the crowd began chanting, "Show your puppies!" to Debra on the outside of the ring.  Hart finally turns things around as he and Jeff Jarrett double team Road Dogg.  Road Dogg finally recovers and would have been able to pin Owen Hart if it weren't for Jarrett who had the Referee distracted in the corner which allowed Hart to recover and for him to kick out of the pin attempt.  Jarrett then came in, while the Ref's back was turned, and switched with Owen without tagging his partner.  The crowd is heavily behind the New Age Outlaws in this match, but it has so far been almost all Jarrett and Owen Hart.  
<p>
Road Dogg finally makes the hot tag to Billy Gunn who runs in and clears the ring before all 4 men end up in the ring with the Outlaws each nailing Jarrett and Hart int he corner before whipping them into each other.  Gunn then clotheslines Jarrett out of the ring, as Hart recovers and goes after Road Dogg as he is about to entice Debra to remove her top.  Road Dogg nails a pump handle slam and almost gets the pinfall before Jarrett came in and stops the count.  Hart then gets Road Dogg in the sharpshooter, but Gunn nails him with a rocker dropper while he has Road Dogg in the hold and he pins Owen Hart!  <b>Winners:</b> The New Age Outlaws are the new #1 contenders!
<p>
<b>Boiler Room Brawl<br>Mankind vs. Paul Wight</b><br>
They cut to the boiler room of the building, as Paul Wight is walking around looking for Mankind who runs in and attacks him from behind!  The rules for this match are simple: whoever can get out of the boiler room wins.  Mankind starts things off right away, nailing Wight's arm with a door before Wight recovers and throws Mankind against some shelves before throwing him across the room.
<p>
Paul Wight has control until Mankind nails him with multiple pieces of dry wall, but it can't keep Wight at bay as he pounds Mankind with a trash can before putting him in a shopping cart and sending him flying into some wood.  They cut to the outside, where Teddy Long is waiting outside for whoever walks out the door first and will win the match.  Wight has his eyes set on the door as he is nailed by Mankind from behind with a sheet of glass.  He then sets up a ladder across from Wight and slowly climbs to the topto try to reach for a hook that is hanging from the ceiling but Wight recovers and throws him off the ladder and thru two tables that had boxes of glass stacked on them!  Wight is busted up in the face from the glass shot, but he continues pounding on Mankind and nailing him with more sheets of glass!  Mankind is bleeding very heavily from his left hand.
<p>
Wight is throwing Foley around like a rag doll, leaving a blood of trail on the way as both he and Mankind are bleeding.  This match is much more hardcore then the so called "Hardcore" Title Match from earlier in the night.  Mankind is able to take Wight out by throwing him into a stack of pipes, which fall on him and allow Foley to crawl to the door... leaving a trail of bloody hand prints on the way.  Foley walks thru the door! Foley wins!  But The Corporation is waiting on the outside and attack Mankind while Wight recovers and chases The Bossman out of the boiler room and leaves Mankind in the room with Test.  <b>Winner:</b> Mankind!
<p>
<b>X-Pac vs. Triple H</b><br>
X-Pac is introduced first, to a loud pop from the crowd followed by Triple H to his new music, accompanied by Chyna.  X-Pac starts things off right away, but it is Hunter who comes out on top as he nails him with an elbow but that doesn't stop X-Pac as he nails Hunter with a spinwheel kick that sends Hunter to the outside.  Once Triple H got back in the ring, he was able to get some control over the match and sent X-Pac flying to the outside of the ring but it couldn't keep him down as neither man has kept control of the match for more then a few minutes.
<p>
As both men got back into the ring, Hunter had control but X-Pac fought back and then whipped him into the corner and went running towards him only to be nailed with a big boot to the face... but he recovers and hits another spinwheel kick that knocks Hunter to the mat.  X-Pac sends Hunter back into the corner and sets him up for the bronco buster, but Chyna distracts X-Pac and when he finally goes to nail it... Hunter gets out of the way and X-Pac nails the turnbuckle!
<p>
Hunter takes control of the match and sets X-Pac on the middle rope before argueing with the Referee and allowing Chyna to deck X-Pac and allows Hunter to go back to pounding on X-Pac in the center of the ring.  X-Pac wouldn't give up, as he kept kicking out of every pin attempt by Triple H.  Hunter then put X-Pac in the dragon sleeper hold, but X-Pac still wouldn't be kept down as he fought back and was able to kick Hunter in the head twice while in the hold.  X-Pac fights back but is met by a big knee to the face by Hunter, but he still kicks out of the pin attempt before Triple H throws him to the outside and allows Chyna to press slam him into the guard rail while the Referee is distracted in the ring.
<p>
As Triple H went for the Pedigree, the Referee was distracted by Chyna which allowed X-Pac to nail Hunter with a low blow for an attempted pinfall.  But Hunter kicks out, and then throws X-Pac to the outside where he tries to throw him into the steps but X-Pac reverses it and whips Hunter into the steps, knocking them over.  As X-Pac went to nail Hunter again, the Referee was caught in the middle and nailed by a baseball slide by X-Pac and knocked out.  Both men go back in the ring, where X-Pac nails Hunter with the X-Factor but the Referee is knocked out on the outside.  Chyna crawls into the ring and nails X-Pac with a lowblow and then a reverse DDT.  She then pulls Hunter on top of X-Pac and then the lights go out!  Kane makes his entrance!  Chyna doesn't know what to do as she looks on in the ring as Kane makes his way to the ring!  Kane grabs Chyna but Hunter nails him from behind but it isn't enough as Kane chokeslams Hunter and then he turns around and chokeslams Chyna as well!
<p>
Kane then sets up both Chyna and Hunter in opposite corners against the bottom turnbuckle, and then leaves.  X-Pac slowly gets up as does the Referee and X-Pac see's Chyna and Hunter and then he nails them both with bronco busters!  But after he nails Chyna, Hunter recovers and nails X-Pac with the pedigree for the pinfall.  <b>Winner:</b> Triple H with Chyna.
<p>
<b>The Undertaker vs. Ken Shamrock</b><br>
Ken Shamrock is introduced first, going into this match against The Undertaker after watching his sister crucified at the hands of The Ministry.  The Undertaker made his entrance next, accompanied by his manager Paul Bearer.  Once he gets to the ring, things start off right away with The Undertaker coming out on top nailing his trademark rope walking move on Ken Shamrock.
<p>
Ken Shamrock mounted some offense, getting The Undertaker in a submission hold but only had The Undertaker fight out of it and eventually nailing him with a kick to the chest.  The match went back and forth a few more times before Shamrock once again took control and put The Undetaker in his ankle lock submission hold, only to have him make it to the rope and the Referee broke the hold but Shamrock continued to keep control of the match once again putting him in a leg submission hold.
<p>
The Undertaker fought out of the submission hold and to his feet, whiped Shamrock into the ropes and went for a hiptoss but was met by a reversal as Shamrock once again put him in a leg submission hold.  With the match being taken to the mat with alot of submission holds, the crowd wasn't too into the match and was fairly quiet most of the time.  
<p>
Both men fought to the outside, where Shamrock setup The Undertaker's leg on the ringsteps and stopped on his ankle multiple times as it was setup against the metal of the steps.  They then rolled back in the ring with Shamrock continueing to work on The Undertaker's legs.  The Undertaker fought back and had Shamrock in the corner before chasing the Referee out of the ring and then going back to Shamrock who nailed him with a kick to the chest but The Undertaker turned the tables on him with a drop toe hold and then nailed him with fists to the face.  Shamrock wouldn't be kept down as he turned things around with yet another submission hold, but The Undertaker was able to get to the ropes and the Referee was forced to break the hold.
<p>
The Undertaker then took control of the match with multiple forearm shots to the back of Shamrock, and then nailing him with a backbreaker before stretching him across his leg in a submission hold.  The crowd is truely dead so far during this match as Shamrock fights back and once again puts The Undertaker in an ankle submission hold as The Undertaker fought to get to the ropes before Shamrock broke the hold and went for another submission hold before having it reversed by The Undertaker into a half boston crab as the crowd looks on in boredom.
<p>
Shamrock fights back and nails The Undertaker with some shoulder blocks before going for another and is met by a big boot to the face as The Undertaker trys to take Shamrock's head off.  Shamrock then goes diving into The Undertaker's leg, knocking him off his feet and as he got back up he was met by a huracurrana by Shamrock who then went for his ankle lock hold only to have The Undertaker throw him off right away.  But a few moments later, Shamrock once again puts him in the ankle lock submission hold only to have Bradshaw attempt to interfere.  This allowed The Undertaker to recover and go for a chokeslam, which Shamrock reversed into a submission hold... but once again he was distracted as Paul Bearer tried to interfere.  The Undertaker gets nailed by Shamrock's belly to bellt suplex but this can't keep him down as he gets up and nails Shamrock with the tombstone piledriver for the victory! <b>Winner:</b> The Undertaker.
<p>
Afterwards, Bradshaw got in the ring and beat Shamrock with a baseball bat after The Undertaker ordered him to do so.  He then choked out Shamrock with the baseball bat before leaving the ring.
<p>

Austin ran down to the ring and started things off right from the start by nailing The Rock before turning his back on him to stare down Shane McMahon which allowed The Rock to get the upperhand.  But Austin wouldn't be held down for long as he nailed the Rock with a Lou Thesz Press before nailing him with fists to the face.  The action then went to the outside, with The Rock taking control and beating on Austin all the way up the entranceway and nailing him with a fire extinguisher.  The Rock then whipped Austin into the entranceway itself, knocking part of it over.
<p>
Austin fights back, nailing The Rock before tossing him into the otherside of the entranceway, not completely toppling the other half of the Backlash entrance set.  Austin continued to beat on The Rock, eventually nailing him with a large amplifier case which he rolled across the concrete right into The Rock's head before he climbd on top of it and went to nail The Rock again but he missed and ended up having the case thrown right back into himself.
<p>
They fought their way back into the ring where Austin had control, and for the first time in the match Shane McMahon got somewhat involved as he pushed Austin back and taunted him.  The Rock tried to take advantage, but Austin was able to toss him over the toprope to the outside.  Austin then setup The Rock ontop of the spanish announcers table and was going to go for a piledriver, but The Rock got out of it and nailed Austin with the Rock Bottom which crushed the announcers table.  The Rock then got on one of the spanish announcers headsets and started taunting Austin before he picked him up and nailed him with a right hand.  But Austin fought back, and the two went over the guard rail to the outside where The Rock once again took control of the match.  Shane then told The Rock to take him back into the ring, and Austin was tossed over the guard rail and back towards the ring.  The Rock then picked up the top of the regular announcers table and nailed Austin with it before finally setting him up on top of the announcers table before grabbing one of the ringside cameras and holding it while doing his own commentary and taking shots of the crowd before turning back towards Austin who was now standing up facing him with 2 middle fingers right in his face!  Austin then sent them both off the table.
<p>
Austin then brought the match back into the ring as the announcers questioned wether or not they were still on live.  The Rock then pushed Austin back into Shane McMahon, and Shane was about to DQ Austin but he decided to roll The Rock over on to Austin for a pin attempt instead... but Austin kicked out!  Shane then went to the outside and grabbed the title belt and brought it into the ring and waited for Austin to stand up but both men stood up at the same time and Shane accidently nailed  The Rock with the title belt!  Austin then nailed The Rock and went for the pinfall but Shane only counted to 2 before giving him the finger and rolling out of the ring!
<p>
