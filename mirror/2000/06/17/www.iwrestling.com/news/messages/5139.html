WWF RAW is WAR results: 6/12<br>Commentators: Jim Ross and Jerry "The King" Lawler<br>Report by: Kevin Gregg of PowerWrestling.com<p>Welcome everyone, welcome to RAW is WAR! RAW starts off with footage from Judgment Day when the Undertaker made his return and cost The Rock the WWF Championship. More clips are shown, and it's of the Undertaker attacking The Rock and The Rock even fired back on the Undertaker. The relationship between the Undertaker and The Rock are obviously not good at all, and we are live for RAW from St. Louis, Missouri. The Rock, the Undertaker and Kane are all in the house, and they want to destroy each other. Jim Ross is along side Jerry "The King" Lawler, and to kick off the night, the music of The Rock starts playing and he is on his way to the ring.<p>The fans go nuts for The Rock as he grabs the mic, and he gets on the mic and says "Finally, The Rock has come back to St. Louis!" The Rock says that he has heard that all weekend long that come Monday night, The Rock is in store for a fight. Come Monday night, Kane and the Undertaker are going to get back at The Rock for hitting them with chairs. The entire Faction will get back at The Rock for making their lives a living hell. The Rock says this: "It's Monday night." The Rock tells the Undertaker to bring his American Bad A$$, Kane and Triple H to all bring it to the ring. Kane's music comes on, and he is on his way to the ring to get face to face with The Rock!<p>Kane gets in the ring and gets on the mic and he questions The Rock as to "just bring it", and then he tells The Rock to consider it brought. Kane starts getting closer to The Rock and then the music of the Undertaker comes on, and he is on his way to the ring as well! The Undertaker gets in the ring and then the RAW is WAR music comes on, and Linda McMahon comes out with a mic and she is on her way to the ring. "Every time she shows up, something bad happens, J.R.!" - Jerry Lawler. Linda gets up in the ring and she tells the three of them to wait just one minute. Linda asks them what they are trying to do, and what they are thinking.<p>Linda says they look like they are going to tear each other apart. Linda tells the three of them that the McMahon/Helmsley Faction must be sitting in the back laughing at them. Linda asks them if they are going to get sucked into that divide and conquer strategy. Linda tells them that they can't let that happen, and they can't fight against each other. They have got to be united, at least for the next two weeks until the King of the Ring. Linda starts to ask them something, and then the music of the Corporation comes on and it's the McMahon/Helmsley Regime, and Vince is along with them!<p>Vince asks Linda who the hell she thinks she is, as he stands on the RAW stage. Vince asks Linda if she would like to be mother Theresa, or someone like that. A peace keeper, and she wants to do good for every body? Or maybe she thinks herself as a modern day Joan of Ark. Vince says that since she is trying to lay the law down, maybe she thinks of herself as an attractive Janet Reno. The fans start chanting "Shane's a p*ssy!", and Vince says that he certainly is not that. Vince tells Linda who she truly is, and that is a goody two shoes, castrating, shrew of a wife. Vince says that's really who she is, just to get the record straight.<p>Simply because it amuses them, Linda was talking about those three joining forces. Vince questions that, and the fans start chanting "A$$hole, a$$hole!" Linda says that before she was so rudely interrupted when he came out, she was about to say that those three men are going to join forces as one half of a six man tag team at the King of the Ring. The other half of the six man tag team is Triple H, Shane McMahon and Vince McMahon. Vince accepts the challenge, and Shane questions Vince. Vince says that they aren't going to embarrass him by coming out here and putting him in a position, that isn't going to happen.<p>Vince says that he doesn't give a damn what match she makes at the King of the Ring, tonight, tomorrow night or any other night. Linda says that if that is the case, how about tonight, Triple H will defend the World Wrestling Federation Championship against an opponent of Linda's choosing. Vince says that she's got it, and she's damn right she's got it. Triple H doesn't look too happy, and Vince says that Triple H doesn't know who his opponent is, but he will do it anyway, even though it's not fair. Linda says that if he doesn't think that is fair, he probably isn't going to like this, either. There is another Championship that needs to be defended here tonight and that is Stephanie!<p>Tonight, Stephanie will defend the World Wrestling Federation Women's Championship against Lita. Linda puts a stipulation on the match, and that's if any member of the Faction interferes in the match at all, Stephanie will be disqualified, and Lita will be awarded the Championship. Vince tells Linda that she's got that, too. Now that Linda has made her little announcements, little Mrs. CEO can go back and play her part somewhere else. The Faction starts to leave, and Linda tells them to hold on, and Linda says that she doesn't play CEO, she IS the CEO!<p>Vince starts to leave, and Linda says that as the CEO, she will make this one final announcement, tonight. Tonight, Shane McMahon will see action. Also tonight, Vince McMahon will see action! Both Shane and Vince McMahon will team up in tag team action against the Dudley Boyz! Linda says that it's not just any tag team match, it's a tag team tables match! Linda is shown leaving the arena, and Triple H and Stephanie show up. Triple H asks Linda who she is facing. Linda tells Triple H that he can sweet talk her daughter, but he can't sweet talk her. Linda tells Stephanie to get changed, because she is up next!<p><I><CENTER><B><U>King of the Ring Qualifying Match</U><br>X-Pac vs. Dean Malenko</B></CENTER></I>X-Pac, The Road Dogg and Tori are on their way to the ring, and X-Pac is going against Dean Malenko in this King of the Ring Qualifying Match.

She has carried that title with dignity, honor and pride, and she knows that despite that filthy name the fans call her, that deep down, she really has their support.

Stephanie then is able to get up and she gets back in the ring and pins Lita to get the win and retain the belt! <p>Triple H looks on from the back, and he looks happy that Stephanie retained the belt as Stephanie and Kurt Angle celebrate. The two celebrate in the ring Kurt Angle style. The two hug in the ring and Triple H continues to look on and it looks like he is getting angry at Kurt Angle and Stephanie hugging in the ring.
