WWF Smackdown results: 4/6<br>Commentators: Jerry "The King" Lawler and Michael Cole<br>Report by: Kevin Gregg of (www.powerwrestling.com)<br>WWF Smackdown! starts off with footage from this past Monday night when The Rock and Triple H clashed, but it wasn't really an official match. The Rock pinned Triple H and was awarded the winner of a match that he was going against Shane McMahon in, but The Rock didn't become the new WWF Champion. Shane McMahon is shown backstage talking on a cell phone, and he's talking to Vince, and he wants to clear up the controversy with The Rock. Vince tells Shane on the phone that he will be at the arena shortly.<p><br>World Wrestling Federation Intercontinental Championship Match<br>Rikishi Phatu vs. Chris Benoit (c)<br>Michael Cole is along side Jerry "The King" Lawler, and Smackdown! is from San Jose, California! Too Cool's music is playing in the arena, and it's Rikishi on his way to the ring. Rikishi Phatu is going against Chris Benoit in a one on one match, and the Intercontinental Championship is on the line in this match. Chris Benoit comes to the ring to some boos, and he won the WWF Intercontinental belt at Wrestlemania when he pinned Chris Jericho in the Triple Threat match. Benoit gets in the ring and hands the belt over to the referee, and he's ready to take on Rikishi Phatu.<br>Rikishi stands in the corner as Chris Benoit stands in the center of the ring and looks at Rikishi. Rikishi gets in the face of Chris Benoit and he goes for a right hand, but Rikishi blocks it and nails Benoit with some rights of his own. Rikishi takes Chris Benoit down with a clothesline and then he goes for a back body drop, but Benoit goes for a sunset flip. Rikishi goes to sit down on Benoit, but Benoit moves out of the way. Chris Benoit then backs Rikishi into the corner and kicks away on him as the referee tries to get them out of the corner.<p>Benoit nails Rikishi with a right hand and then chops him in the chest a number of times as it doesn't seem to effect Rikishi. Rikishi takes them as if they were nothing and then gives Benoit a neck breaker as he comes off the ropes. Rikishi whips Benoit to the corner, and then kicks him in the back of the head with a super kick. Rikishi then goes to splash Benoit in the corner, but Benoit moves out of the way. Benoit gets a belly to belly suplex into a pin on Rikishi to get the win and retain the belt. Benoit celebrates and Rikishi is stunned in the ring. <p>Chris charges at Rikishi, but Rikishi gets a samoan drop on him. From there, Rikishi drags Benoit to the corner and then puts his ass in the face of the WWF Intercontinental Champion. The announcers call it the "Stink Face". Benoit goes after Rikishi again, and Rikishi gives Benoit a belly to belly suplex. Rikishi once again drags Benoit to the corner and then he gives Benoit the banzai drop.<p><br>Winner and still WWF Intercontinental Champion, Chris Benoit<br>A limo is shown arriving to the arena in the backstage area, and Shane opens the door, and it's Vince. Shane says that they are the only ones there, and the two head into the arena. As they go to the arena, Vince says that they are the only ones they need here. Vince and Shane's music is now playing in the arena, and the two are headed to the ring and we are about to find more about the controversy involving the WWF belt. The fans chant "Asshole, asshole!" as Vince gets ready to get on the mic.<p>Vince gets on the mic and says that before the fans in Sacramento get all upset. Vince says the entire state is going to fall into the bottom of the Pacific Ocean sooner or later, so it doesn't matter where they are. Vince says he's going to put an end to the nasty rumor that was going around earlier tonight, and that's the rumor of DX not being at Smackdown! tonight. Vince says that as soon as DX has finished with their autograph session, to prevent a run on the box office on all the fans demanding a refund, DX will be here tonight.<p>Vince says that he is going to clear up the controversy from Monday night, and he shows some footage from this past Monday night when The Rock pinned the WWF Champion, Triple H. Vince says that what you saw was a very frustrated Rock, and why? He was so frustrated, because he couldn't beat Shane one on one, and he took those frustrations out on someone else that he couldn't beat one on one at Wrestlemania, and that's his son in law, Triple H. Vince says that what you saw was referee Earl Hebner counting one, two, three. You heard the ring announcer, Lilian Garcia proclaim The Rock the winner.<p>The fans start chanting "Shane's a pussy!" Vince says that the fans here in Sacramento are downright rude! Vince says that what we saw in the closing moments of RAW was The Rock holding the WWF title above his head. Vince says to clear up the controversy now, and to get to the bottom of it. Vince tells referee Earl Hebner to come out to the ring now to clear up the controversy once and for all. Vince asks Earl if he can offer the public any explanation as to why he would count the three count in a non sanctioned match. Earl says it's because The Rock told him to count one, two, three.<p>Vince says that until this moment, the integrity of WWF officials has never been questioned, but what Earl has done is degraded the integrity with his bias. Vince tells Earl that if he ever does that again, he will knock him on his ass! Vince tells Earl to get out of the ring and then he asks about the ring announcer. Vince invites Lilian to come to the ring and she does just that. Vince says that before they ask her to offer some sort of explanation, he understands that in addition to being a misinformed ring announcer, she isn't a bad singer. Vince says that if that's the case, why doesn't she just assume that right here it's just her and Vince.<p>Vince says no one else is around, and he asks her to sing him a little song. Vince touches Lilian's hair, and asks her to sing something like "Do you know the way to San Jose". Lilian starts to sing and the fans cheer her like crazy. Vince smiles and says that's enough. Vince says the point that he is making that pretty women with a little bit of talent are a dime a dozen and she can be replaced in an instant. Vince says that the next time she makes a mistake like she did on Monday night, the only thing she is going to be signing is the blues!<p>Vince says that you have to understand, it's not easy being the boss. You've got incompetence surrounding you, and the point is that The Rock is not the World Wrestling Federation, nor is he likely to ever be again. Vince says there was one other mistake that was made and that other mistake last Monday involved good old J.R. Vince says it was when Good Old J.R. insinuated that maybe Shane and Vince wouldn't have the intestinal fortitude to stand up to The Rock. Vince says that it's been said before that his testicles are the size of grapefruits! Vince says that's why here tonight in Sacramento in this very ring, Shane and Vince McMahon will team up and in a handicap match, the McMahons will square off against The Rock!<p><br>T&A vs. the Dudley Boyz<br>Trish Stratus is shown backstage and she is leading T&A to the ring, and they are going to meet the Dudley Boyz in tag team action! T&A are now headed to the ring, and they're ready to take on the Dudley Boyz in tag team action. The Dudley Boyz get in the ring and Test is going to start the match off against D-Von Dudley. D-Von nails Test with a right hand and then he goes to whip him off the ropes, but Test reverses it and power bombs D-Von Dudley. Test whips D-Von off the ropes and then gives him an elbow when he comes back. D-Von tags in Buh Buh Ray Dudley and the two double team Test for a moment and Buh Buh chops away on Test in the corner.<br>Test whips Buh Buh into the corner and charges at him, but he gets a boot to the face. Buh Buh nails Test with a clothesline off the second rope and then he pins him and Test kicks out. Test gives Buh Buh a back body drop and then tags in Albert. Albert and Test double team Buh Buh Ray Dudley, and Test gives Buh Buh a huge boot to the face and Albert pins him for a two count. Albert nails Buh Buh with a couple of head butts and then Buh Buh fires back with a clothesline. D-Von gives Albert a headbutt to the groin from the top rope behind the referee's back and Trish doesn't like what she sees. <p>Buh Buh tags in D-Von and D-Von works on Albert. D-Von whips Albert off the ropes, and Albert reverses it and when he comes back, Albert gives D-Von a bicycle kick and then he pins him for a two count. Albert slingshots D-Von into the second rope and D-Von gets up and fires back with some right hands and he whips Albert into the corner. D-Von charges into Albert, but Albert gets his foot up and gives him a boot to the face. Albert whips D-Von into the corner and then he charges at him, but D-Von moves out of the way. D-Von tags in Buh Buh as Albert tags in Test and Test works on Buh Buh. Buh Buh gives Test the Buh Buh Cutter and Albert breaks up the three count.<p>All four men get in the ring and fight and Albert knocks D-Von out of the ring and Test whips Buh Buh into a choke powerbomb by Albert. From there, Test goes to the top rope and gives Buh Buh an elbow drop and pins him for a two count as D-Von is there to break up the count. The fans chant for the 3D as the Dudley Boyz take Albert out of the ring and then they give Test the Dudley Death Drop to get the win. After the contest, Trish gets in the ring to attend to Test, and Buh Buh gets that look on his face.<p><br>Winners - The Dudley Boyz<br>Buh Buh comes up from behind of Trish and he grabs her by the hair and then he tells D-Von to get a table up in the ring. Albert stops D-Von from getting the table, and that allowed Trish and Test to get out of the ring. The Hardy Boyz come to the ring and hammer away on Buh Buh and D-Von Dudley and WWF officials come to the ring and do their best to break the fight up.<p>Scotty 2 Hotty is shown backstage, and Kurt shows up and he says that he has the chance to get some more Championship gold. Kurt says he has a chance at the tag team belts, and he asks him if he wants to be his tag team partner. Scotty says no, and he says that when Grandmaster Sexay comes back, they will get their shot at the tag team belt as he isn't going to team with Kurt.<p><br>Tazz vs. Perry Saturn<br>The Rock is shown in the backstage area and he's just pacing back and forth as Tazz's music is playing in the arena. Tazz is set for one on one action against Perry Saturn. As Tazz is making his way to the ring, Perry Saturn comes out of no where and attacks Tazz from behind. Perry throws Tazz into the security wall and then Tazz gets up and whips Saturn into the steel steps. The two battle on the outside of the ring and in the aisle way, and this match is yet to officially start. The two fight into the tech area, and the cameras go to Kevin Kelly while they try to get control out in the arena.<p>Winner - No contest<br>Kevin Kelly is with The Rock, and Kevin asks him how he feels about the situation with him against Vince and Shane in a handicap match. The fans chant for The Rock and The Rock says that Shane can suck on a monkey's nipple, and Vince can go lick a llamas anus! The Rock says that Vince and Shane come out and run their mouths like they are the big shots like they are The Rock. The Rock says he isn't scared of Vince and Shane and they don't strike any type of fear in The Rock's heart. <p>The Rock says Vince is the owner of a very successfully company and even without anyone's approval, The Rock still stands on top of the WWF and reigns supreme. The Rock says he accepts the challenge, because tonight, it's going to be Vince and Shane going against The Rock on The Rock's show of Smackdown!. The Rock says it's going to be a beautiful thing, because he plans on raising the people's hand, and Shane gets the front and Vince gets the back. When it's all said and done, the two candy asses will smell what The Rock is cooking.<p><br>Steve Blackman and Al Snow vs. the Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan<br>The Degeneration X bus is shown arriving to the arena and they are riding in style! They all get off the bus and we go back to the arena and Steve Blackman's music is playing. Steve and Al Snow are on their way to the ring and they are set for tag team action here tonight.
