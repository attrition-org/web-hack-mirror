<font size="2" face="arial"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#0088EC"><b>HUGE News Update: 06/14/00: KOTR, HHH; More!!</b></font><br>
By <a href="mailto:deaconheat@aol.com">Mikey G</a> on June 14, 2000<p>
I got online this morning only to find a few e-mails with some fans eyewitness reports from this week's Thunder and Smackdown taping. I'm not gonna' sit here and rattle off what happened, as I'm sure you've already read the spoilers, but nonetheless, those fans seemed disappointed. I'm not sure the midweek Pro Wrestling shows are going to be as exciting as they were last week, but, I could be wrong. If you're looking for spoilers [and want to guess your own opinion on how the shows look], then stay here at iWrestling for the results or see my link at the bottom of the page. Enjoy the Update!<p>To kick off things, I've got myself a little exclusive here on the whereabouts of Hillbilly Jim [If you don't remember him, he's the, well, hillbilly type wrestler that was on WWF TV for most of the late-80's into the early 90's]. It appears as if Jim is still with the company and does behind-the-scenes work. Circuit City has a little monthly magazine exclusive to their stores' called "Video." In this months issue, they did a feature on the popularity on WWF Home Video's and Rentals. Anyway, for a good half of the article, Hillbilly Jim was interviewed saying how he's now one of the top "Sales Personnel" for WWF Home Video, as we speak. He also mentioned that he helps organize a lot of setting up for new WWF Video Games, in which he's the coordinator for such things as whose voice is recorded and when [etc].<p>I try to keep this Update as organized as possible so it's easier for you to read, so the following category [as noted with the bullets] are a bunch of WCW assorted tidbits...<p><LI> I'm not so sure this whole "Kimberly quitting" escapade is as serious as it sounds, but as of now, nothing can be confirmed. I checked out <a href="http://www.DDPBang.com"><B>DDPBang.com</B></A> earlier in the day to find nothing, so I talked to my buddy Shane Helms who told me the following [from what he knows]: "...<I>I haven't heard anything official, so I have no official comment. It might even be a part of some sort of storyline, but who knows...</I>" <p><LI> Massive face-pushes are in-line for the likes of Buff Bagwell, Billy Kidman and G.I. Bro, all of which may end up with a title somewhere down the road.<p><LI> Nitro was said to have horrible production problems once again, with the worst of it squared up to the live crowd. It's being said that the Nitro Vision Screen was blanking in-and-out for the first thirty-to-forty minutes, causing the actual fans in the arena to miss a near entirety of the Big Vito vs. Terry Funk match, when it was in the backstage area.<p><LI> Yesterday I exclusively pointed out [but never really explained] the comment from the WCW PPV when Bischoff said, "...Don't you get PPV in Montana?" I'm hearing all sorts of things now on "who" he could've been talking to. If a copy of the ECW vs. TNN storyline takes place, you could deduce a WCW vs. SFX would happen, with Ted Turner on WCW's side. Ted Turner owns the largest portion of land in Montana, something like a reported "eighteenth of the state." I'd imagine Bischoff's comments will be explained soon, but until then...<p><LI> In today's last WCW tidbit, it appears as if a few "boys in the back" are upset with Vince Russo. It's not like they're coming in from a sideswipe with all sorts of crazy reasons, it's just that they are simply frustrated with how Russo's ran things as of late. It's an old tale now that if you're not on Russo's good side from the start of things, flat out -- you're simply screwed from then on. If you're not willing to take a bump or follow orders, chances aren't so good you'll be in the ranks anymore. Complaints have been brewing now, but not to the point where anyone's talked to Brad Siegel about it -- which might just be the next step in this whole mess.<p>I guess this is a bad day for the ECW fan, as I've got nothin' on the plate pertaining to any "extreme" news. If you're a WWF fan, enjoy the rest of the Update...<p>If you've ordered any WWF PPV's within the past few months, then your local cable company probably sent you this packet on WWF PPV's, with the mini-cover-story pertaining to the July 23rd "Fully Loaded" show. Inside this story is the main-quote, which is either extremely revealing or misleading ... you be the judge...<p><I>"Stone Cold Steve Austin prepares to get even with those who have stood in his way in the past" . could this be an indication of SCSA return?"</I><p>The always-accurate <a href="http://www.Multichannel.com"><B>MultiChannel-Online</B></A> has another interesting story pertaining to the WWF's struggle with the USA Network. It appears as if USA's Board of Operation "vetoed," if you will, an idea from Vince McMahon himself that would've had a sister-network ran by USA called "The Man Channel." On this twenty-four hour around-the-clock station, you'd see such features as Karate, Sumo Wrestling, Extreme Sports, Boxing and of course, Pro Wrestling. Once again, to make this more clear, it will not happen because USA is finding every possible way to take cheap shots at WWF for their wanting out of contract. That's simply arrogant and selfish on behalf of the entire USA Board.<p>It's become aware to me that The British Bulldog isn't on the active and current WWF roster. The family and personal problems Davey Smith's had have kept him sidelined for so long that it looks as if WWF's extremely close to making his release official. As of now, Bulldog doesn't have it in him to make a sudden return as his physical appearance and audacity isn't one to be toyed with. Keep an eye on this story in the near-future...<p>I've come across some rumors today that there might be weak chatter in WWF Creative Meetings of siding Jacqueline with D'lo Brown, in order to add a quick boost to his planned push. In all reality, if Jacque is paired with anyone, it'd be used as a push only because having a valet adds that certain spark that has boosted many careers. Another name being thrown around is Viscera, whose new gimmick would have something to directly do with her.<p>Shane McMahon is currently taking just a little time outta' his schedule to train for his match at the KOTR. I shouldn't really single out just one match, as Shane will most likely wrestle in the near future. Even though it's beside the point, McMahon's being trained by Sgt. Slaughter, who has trained a few of the higher-up's in previous matches, such as Vince, for example.<p>Speaking of the "<a href="http://www.WWFKingoftheRing.com"><B>King of the Ring</B></A>" PPV, the main event may very soon have a special stipulation added to it. In what may be announced extremely close to the airing of the PPV, it's being said that whomever the commissioner might be, or Linda McMahon, will announce that if a member of HHH's team is pinned, whoever does the "pinning" is awarded the WWF World Title. Then, whomever would win the actual KOTR Tournament would be declared the "Number One Contender," as previous KOTR's have done as well.<p>Adios.
