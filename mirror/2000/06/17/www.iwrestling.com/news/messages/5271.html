By <a href="mailto:chilln@top-rope.com">Nick Evanish</a> on June 15, 2000<p>
WWF Byte This Report<br>Hosted by: Dr. Tom Pritchard & Jonathan Coachman<br>Special Guest: Trish Stratus<p>Note: All kayfabe comments will be written in bold.<p>- Jonathan Coachman (Coach) is the new co-host of Byte This.<p>- Rundown of what happened on Raw and what to expect on Smackdown and Sunday Night Heat.<p>- Preview of the PPV. You can check out the King of the Ring site by clicking here.<p>- Trish Stratus joined the show. She felt "honored" to be involved with the show. They asked her about the rumors that she has a thing for the Coach. She admires him for his professionalism and his broadcasting skills.<p>Trish's first few months in the WWF has been amazing. She encounters new challenges every day but she loves it. On her first TV appearance in the WWF, she thought that Test and Albert were 2 guys that she could do something with, so she decided to manage them.<p>She talked about her background. She was a fitness model before coming to the WWF in college, she was pre-med and was studying for her MCAT's. Before she could graduate, the professors went on strike which kept her from being able to finish. At that time, she was approached by a fitness magazine and later became a fitness model.<p>Trish has been a wrestling fan for a long time.<p>Her decision to go the WWF over "another federation" is because it is a bigger federation.<p>Trish's kiss of Buh Buh Ray Dudley was not emotional and was something she did to get herself out of a situation.<p>By managing Test & Albert, as well as Val Venis, she feels that she will lead them to WWF gold.<p>Trish spoke about her interaction with fans in the arenas. Occasionally, she is called a "bitch." During Judgment Day, fans were very emotional during her confrontation with the Dudleys.<p>Internet rumors of her being hurt from the table bump with the Dudleys are not true. She feels that because of her workout regimen, she recovered quickly and was back in action soon. She is open to getting involved in the ring if the time calls for it but right now she is taking it be ear.<p>She talked about the "stinkface" she received from Rikishi. Perhaps she "pissed" him off and that is what she got in return. Coach informed her that it was the longest stinkface in WWF history so she is happy that she accomplished something with that.<p>The rumor that she is doing a shoot for Playboy is not true. She is not against it but it is a situational thing and if it comes along again, she will think about it.<p>The WWF Divas photo shoot was a great opportunity for her to meet the other girls in the company. She had not been on TV yet and it was a great experience. She is honored to be a part of WWF magazine and the website as well.<p>Everyone in the company has played a part in her adjusting to life on the road with the WWF. The office has been very good to her as well. She is thankful for everyone's help.<p>Dr. Tom and Ron Hutchinson (who trained Edge) have been teaching her how to take bumps in the ring.<p>The Summerslam commercial shoot on the beach in Long Island went well. Chyna and the Kat were in it as well. She describes it as a "modern day 10 (the film)." Part of the commercial is them putting men on the beach in their place.<p>When asked why she wears her coat all the time, she responded that it makes a statement and when she wants to show T & A, she will do it. She is not into flaunting herself for the sake of flaunting herself. If she has to do it for a purpose, then she will do it. For example, when she wanted to get into Buh Buh Ray's head, she flaunted herself.<p>She put over TSN's Off the Record and hopes to be on there soon.<p>Her relationship with Test & Albert is strictly business. She is all about collecting gold in the WWF.<p>Dr. Tom talked about Test and Albert being "middle of the road" guys before being involved with Trish and now their stock is rising.<p>Trish is focusing on Test, Albert and Val right now and not getting a WWF Women's title shot.<p>Trish plans to stick around in the WWF for a while, if they will have her.<p>- Dr. Tom pleaded and extended a personal invitation for Trish to be a Byte This guest live from the WWF studios. He would even remove Coach for that evening.<p>- Dr. Tom guessed that Trish had to spend about 45 minutes to get the stench off her face after receiving the Stinkface from Rikishi.<p>- They spoke about the WWF selling out Raw in Phoenix and the WWF now putting Smackdown tickets on sale Friday morning for Phoenix as well.<p>- When asked if Curt Hennig's WCW contract is up soon, Dr. Tom said that he doesn't care. They did not want to comment on if there is interest from the WWF because he is still under WCW contract.<p>- Byte this guests: Triple H on June 22nd.<p>- The show wrapped up.<br><br><li><a href="http://www.top-rope.com">Will she break up with T&A?
