By <a href="mailto:weirdkev@powerwrestling.com ">Kevin Gregg</a> on June 16, 2000<p>
The Ross Report: Many injury updates, and other notes from J.R.!<br>By Jim Ross<br>June 16, 2000<p>Random news and views from under the black hat ...<p>Lots of injury updates:<p>Godfather. Twisted ankle. Doubtful for the weekend. Questionable for TV.<p>Eddie Guerrero. Knocked heads with Dean Malenko on TV. Lump on his forehead. Will not miss any bookings.<p>Jeff Hardy. Experiencing stomach pains. Under doctor's care. Will not miss any bookings.<p>Undertaker. Still recuperating from pec surgery. Tough as hell and will not miss any bookings.<p>Big Show. Scheduled to be released from doctor's care in a week or two. Rehab ongoing. Working out hard.<p>Steve Blackman. Sore knee. MRI pending. Will be at TVs.<p>Tazz. May be able to return at King of the Ring. Bicep healing well. Needs to knock rust off before returning to WWF rings.<p>Vis. Doctor happy with progress of injured shoulder. Still no return date.<p>Billy Gunn. Rotator cuff healing well. Will know estimated return date by end of June. Looks to be September.<p>Tiger Ali Singh. Doing therapy for strained ligaments. No return date set.<p>Stone Cold Steve Austin. Continues to train daily. Working as hard as possible on his conditioning. Neck healing well and timetable is still end of August for the next update. No return date set.<p>The New York City Licensing Show was this week. Huge event within the business. Billy Gunn, Ivory, Kane, Triple H, Stephanie and the Dudley Boyz represented the company well. Ivory especially does an excellent job on these type of functions.<p>The WWF cookbook is really developing well. Should be around 200 pages! Kevin Kelly and Dennis Brent, among others, including wives of talent relations staffers, have done an awesome job on this project. There are tons of great WWF Superstar recipes, personal stories, photos and more planned for this project, due out in the fall. Lots of my late mamma's recipes are being used and she was a helluva cook. The cover shoot featuring Stone Cold, Debra, Rock, Tori and J.R. will be later this month.<p>This just in from the Virginia Pork Festival! Tazz and Ivory were great Wednesday in Virginia.<p>Rikishi and Too Cool shot their Crunch 'n Munch TV commercial in Chicago Wednesday.<p>Terri is in Columbus, Ohio, Friday night at the Pontiac Nationals. I expect to see more of her on TV soon (not a bad visual!).<p>Too Cool, Edge and Christian, Perry Saturn, Hardcore Holly and Kurt Angle are all in Puerto Rico Friday night for IWA (Victor Quinones). Talent relations' Bruce Prichard has been in San Juan since Wednesday.<p>Of course, Chyna is on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" on NBC Friday night. The Rock is on "The Tonight Show" next Friday, June 23.<p>Headbangers, Taka and Funaki will be in Texas this weekend for Shawn Michaels' TWA organization.<p>Great crowd is expected in Minneapolis Saturday night at the Target Center. Governor Jesse Ventura may attend.<p>Al Snow is in Hawaii for a few days with some appearances and R&R.<p>The Ohio Valley Wrestling show in Louisville, Ky., next Friday night is really going to be special. I'm really proud and happy for Jim Cornette, Danny Davis and their crew for doing such a great job. The WWF has SEVERAL top prospects currently in Louisville who are young, athletic and hungry!<p>Fully Loaded in Dallas on July 23 at Reunion Arena is already sold out!<p>Lots of WrestleMania-oriented activities set for the July 1 Houston live event. Another hot Texas sellout!<p>Jerry Lawler has done some unbelievable artwork for Mick Foley's new Christmas book. The story and the artwork are superb. Due out this fall, just in time for holiday shopping.<p>More and more WWF Superstars will be showing up at WWF New York in the near future. Lots of superstars will be on hand for a big King of the Ring promotion starting June 20 in the Big Apple.<p>Excellent ratings for RAW for a strong show in my view. The Triple H vs. Chris Jericho WWF Title bout peaked with an 8.3 rating! Thanks for watching!<p>Saw it written that some WWF Superstars were being passed over intentionally for "bigger" stars for TV and movie roles. Absolutely untrue. Sounds like a frustrated underachiever whining to me.<p>Stu Hart was never scheduled to accompany the British Bulldog or anyone else to the ring recently in Calgary. No fanfare was planned for Stu in Calgary. How do these lame stories get started?<p>SmackDown! was a strong broadcast! I am always overwhelmed with the masterful job done by WWF TV folks. They are simply the best!<p>Shane McMahon is not training daily with Sgt. Slaughter.<p>Steve Regal is looking awesome in Memphis and will be on the WWF roster very soon. No exact timetable but I would expect by SummerSlam.<p>Bull Buchanan has signed a new multiyear contract with the WWF. We think this big, athletic young man has a huge upside.<p>Grand Master Sexay has agreed to terms to a new multiyear WWF contract and the 28 year old is expected to sign it Tuesday in his hometown of Memphis.<p>Tori is all set to ink a new multiyear deal and it could be signed by the time you read this update. Expect to see her role and exposure on TV continue to develop.<p>There has been talk of J.R. and Jerry "The King" Lawler auditioning for an XFL broadcast role. Maybe the cable package?<p>The Rock will do "Total Request Live" on MTV on Wednesday, June 28.<p>Hope to have a JR's BBQ Sauce update next week. (Let's see some signs at TV!)<p>Things are great and we are grateful for all your support. Take care ...<p>J.R.<p>Credit: WWF.com
