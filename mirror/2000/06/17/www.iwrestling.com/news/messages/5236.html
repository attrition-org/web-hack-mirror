COMPLETE WCW Thunder Report for 6/14:<br>From Norfolk, Virginia,<br>Hosted by Mark Madden, Tony Schiavone, and Mike Tenay,<br>Report by Anthony Schilero of <a href="http://www.iowrestling.com"><b>IOWrestling.com</b></a>.<p> <li>This week&#8217;s edition of WCW Thunder opened with clips of this week&#8217;s edition of WCW Nitro, which included the Goldberg-Nash match.<p><li>The Cat pulled up in a limo with Vince Russo, World Champion Jeff Jarrett, and R&B Security.  Russo asked where the real police were, and he was told that they don&#8217;t want to be involved in his little games.  After Russo and the others walked away, Kevin Nash pulled up behind them.<p><li>Vince Russo, David Flair, The Cat, and Jeff Jarrett came out.  Flair was wearing his father&#8217;s hair around his neck.  Jarrett said that he beat Nash and Hogan in consecutive nights, and he would finish what Goldberg started with Kidman.  He also said that Hogan would get his title shot at Bash at the Beach.  Russo talked about the shaving of the head of Ric Flair, and they showed clips of it.  Russo said that he would bring Ric Flair back tonight.  He took out of a Mr. Potato Head and threw it into the crowd.  Russo then said that Goldberg beat Kevin Nash in front of his own nephew, and asked what kind of a man would do that.<p>-We then heard the voice of Kevin Nash, as he said &#8220;A dead man.&#8221;  Nash brought a bat to the ring and took out R&B Security with it.  He then nailed David Flair with the rubber bat, and then The Cat as Russo and Jarrett ran.<p><li>Commercial break.<p><li>Russo was on the phone with Eric Bischoff and he made sure that Bischoff had Goldberg with him and that they were on their way.  The Cat, David Flair, and Jarrett left Russo alone as Nash was looking for him.<p><center><i><b><u>Match 1: Kronic vs. Chris Candido and Bam Bam Bigelow.</i></b></u></center><p>-Brian Adams got on the mic and said that the biggest joke in WCW, was Kronic losing the tag titles to Stasiak and Palumbo.  Adams wanted a match with the two, but Chris Candido came out and introduced Bam Bam Bigelow.<p>-Brian Clark gave Candido the Death Penalty and a powerslam early.  Clark then tagged Adams and they double-clotheslined Candido down.  Adams gave Candido a Full Nelson Slam and dropped him on his head from a fireman&#8217;s carry.  Bigelow and Adams were on the outside, when Adams sent Bigelow into the announce table and Clark took Candido down with a shoulder block.  Kronic then gave Candido the High Time for the win.  After the match, Bigelow got in the ring and fought both men before security broke it up.<br>-Winners: Kronic.<p><li>Russo went to his limo to see that the tires were flat.<p><li>Commercial break.<p><li>Big Vito got on the mic and said that WCW has its next Italian superstar.  He said that he will be a fighting champion and won't sit around.  Johnny asked Vito why he deserves to be the champion.  Vito said it's because he beat Terry Funk, and Johnny said he could do it too.  Vito said that they're the best tag team and the belt won't come between them.  Vito put the belt around Johnny's waist and hit him with a Kendo stick.  Vito set up a table on the outside and beat on Johnny with sticks.  Vito gave Johnny a jumping DDT off the ring apron through the table, and then Kevin Nash came out.  Vito tried to hit Nash and Nash hit Vito with the bat and got on the mic.  Nash said that he just wanted to let Russo know he was still looking for him.<p><li>Russo was shown saying "He's going to kill me, he's going to kill me."<p><li>Commercial break.<p><li>They showed Miss Hancock rubbing the chest of David Flair.<br><li>Shane Douglas came out and talked about Buff Bagwell leaving The Franchise hanging when hit a security guard and was suspended.  Bagwell ran in the ring and nailed Douglas with a clothesline.  Bigelow and Candido came in to help, in what may be the reformation of the Triple Threat.  Kronic came in and got the Triple Threat out of there.<p><li>Shawn Stasiak and Chuck Palumbo were shown watching a tape of Rick Steiner and Tank Abbot riding motorcycles.  Stasiak and Palumbo made fun of them, and then they were attacked from behind by Steiner and Abbot.<p><li>Commercial break.<p><li>The Cat told Russo that he would stay with him as a limo pulled up.  They thought it was the limo of Bischoff and Goldberg.  The Cat opened the door and ran.  Scott Steiner got out of the limo and then Russo ran.<p><center><i><b><u>Match 2: Mike Awesome and Kanyon vs. Tank Abbot and Rick Steiner.</i></b></u></center><p>-Kanyon, with Mike Awesome, came out and pretended to be Diamond Dallas Page.  Awesome challenged anyone in the back to face the two.<p>-The match was stopped a few minutes in, as it was out of control.  Palumbo and Stasiak ran in and attacked Abbot and Steiner.  Scott Steiner came in and helped his brother out.<br>-Result: No-Contest.<p><li>Commercial break.<p><li>Russo was looking for a car, he found one, and was then attacked by Kevin Nash.  Nash pulled Russo's shirt off as Russo ran.<p><li>Pamela interviewed The Cat and he told Steiner that he wanted him in the ring tonight.<p><li>They showed some clips of the Hogan-Jarrett match on Monday, in which Goldberg interfered, saving Goldberg's title.<p><li>Gene Okerlund interviewed Kidman, and Kidman said that he did what he did on Monday to screw Bischoff.<p><center><i><b><u>Match 3: Kidman vs. Jeff Jarrett, World Title.</i></b></u></center><p>-Kidman took Jarrett down with a head scissors and a dropkick.  They went to the outside and Jarrett dropped Kidman throat first into the guard rail and then sent him into back first.  Kidman tried to dropkick Jarrett, but Jarrett held the ropes and sling-shotted Kidman over the top rope.  Disco Inferno, Konnan, Rey Mysterio, and Tygress came out.  Jarrett said he didn't need their help, and then Kidman almost pinned him.  Kidman went to the top rope and Jarrett punched him up there and went for a superplex, but Kidman turned it into a powerbomb.<p>-Kidman slammed Jarrett's face into the mat and gave him a splash from the top.  Konnan hit Kidman with Jarrett's guitar and Jarrett gave Kidman The Stroke for the win.  Everyone attacked Kidman, but Nash came back and took Jarrett down with a big boot.  Nash wrapped a leather belt around Jarrett's throat and used it to drag him to the back.<br>-Winner: Jeff Jarrett.<p><li>Commercial break.<p><li>Vampiro came out and said it's been three days since he took Sting straight to Hell and ended his career.  Vampiro told a female fan to take a Sting mask off.  He took it off for her and she spit some red stuff in his face.  The woman was Asya.<p>-The Demon made his way to the ring and took Vampiro down with a butterfly suplex, but Vampiro hit him with the blow torch and clotheslined him.  Asya, who is The Demon's fiancé, got in the ring and took the Nail in the Coffin from Vampiro.  The Demon put Vampiro in his casket.<p><li>Commercial break.<p><li>3 Count was shown performing in front of one person.<p><li>Daffney came out and called out Miss Hancock.  They had a bitch fight that was eventually broken up by David Flair.  Crobar came to Daffney's aid as David was yelling at her.  David gave Crobar a low blow and Daffney attended to him.<p><li>The Cat was shown preparing to face Scott Steiner.<p><li>Vince Russo went into The Cat's office, thinking that Nash would never look for him in there, but Nash was waiting for him.  Russo ran out of the office.<p><li>Commercial break.<p><center><i><b><u>Match 4: Scott Steiner vs. The Cat.</i></b></u></center><p>-Steiner got on the mic said a few brief things.<p>-Steiner gave The Cat knee lifts, punches, kicks, and chops.  He then threw The Cat across the ring and The Cat left the ring.  Steiner continued to beat on The Cat and took him down with a SteinerLine.  The Cat whipped Steiner toward the ropes and R&B Security tripped him up.  Steiner turned around and took a kick from The Cat.  Steiner went for a German Suplex, but took a low blow and a chop to the throat from The Cat.  The Cat sent Steiner to the outside, where he was beaten on by R&B Security.  Members of the security group held Steiner for a kick from The Cat.  Midajah gave The Cat a cross body, and Steiner gave him a pair of suplexes and the Steiner Recliner for the win.  The Cat said that he's the commissioner and disqualified Steiner for using an illegal choke hold.  He said that the Steiner Recliner would be banned.<br>-Winner: The Cat.<p><li>Nash was shown calling Scott Hall as he had Jarrett tied up on the floor.<p><li>Commercial break.<p><li>Gene Okerlund interviewed David Flair.  Flair said he would shave Crobar's head tonight.<p><center><i><b><u>Match 5: Crobar vs. David Flair.</i></b></u></center><p>-The match was pretty even in the early going, then Crobar bodyslammed David and came over the top with a slingshot cross body for a 2-count.  They sent to the outside and Crobar hit David with a chair and beat on him with forearm shots.  Crobar set David on the chair and jumped from the ring onto David and the chair.  David crotched Crobar on the gurad rail and chopped his chest.  Back in the ring, David took Crobar down with a gut wrench suplex and then a butterfly suplex.  David superplexed Crobar from the top and went for a pin, but only got a 2-count.<p>-Crobar front-suplexed David and tried to pin him, but David kicked out at two.  Crobar took David down with a dropkick and ripped his shirt off.  Crobar wrapped David's shirt around his neck and threw him across the ring.  Crobar gave David a DDT and then a slingshot leg drop.  David sent Crobar to the outside and did the Ric Flair strut.  David hit Crobar in the head with the Statue of Liberty.  He then sat with his balls on the face of Crobar for the pin and the win.  Daffney came in to help Crobar, but David shoved her down and shaved some of Crobar's hair off.  Miss Hancock came out and begin to strip a little, luring David to the back.<br>-Winner: David Flair.<p><li>Commercial break.<p><li>Kevin Nash led Jeff Jarrett to the ring with the bat around his throat.  Nash said that Russo scarred a vision in his little nephew's brain on Monday.  Nash said several things about Jarrett that were edited.  Nash said that if Russo didn't show his ass, he would powerbomb Jarrett straight to Hell.  Russo's music hit and Russo came out to the entrance ramp.  Russo pulled Scott Hall's contract out of his pocket and said that Nash and Bischoff have done everything they could to protect Scott over the past four years.  Russo said that if Nash didn't leave Jarrett alone, Russo would tear up the contract, and then Goldberg's music hit.  Nash was preparing to powerbomb Jarrett, but was attacked from behind by Goldberg.  Goldberg ripped the ties of Jarrett's wrists, and Jarrett beat on Nash with the bat.  Russo appeared to tear up the contract as the show went off the air, but I couldn't tell.<p><a href="http://www.iowrestling.com"><b>*IOWRESTLING.COM*-*Come see *SEXY REVEALING* photos of BRITNEY SPEARS and Trish Stratus!
