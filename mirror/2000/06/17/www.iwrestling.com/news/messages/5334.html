<font size="2" face="arial"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#0088EC"><b>HUGE News Update: 06/17/00: Trish, Kim; MORE!</b></font><br>
By <a href="mailto:deaconheat@aol.com">Mikey G</a> on June 17, 2000<p>
...My plans were messed up real bad early yesterday morning, and I didn't have time to write, put together or even post an Update. So, today's makes up for yesterday's loss, as I do have a ton of news to throw by ya'. Above all, I'm still extremely short on questions for my next interviews ... so <B>keep sending me in a bunch of questions</B> [by reaching me <a href=mailto:deaconheat@aol.com>here</a>] for Shane Helms [Interview Part Two], WCW's former "Midnight," Ann-Marie Crooks, and my newly added name to the list of interview priorities; Christopher Daniels; whom you might know as Vampiro's "mentor" as seen on WCW TV in the past few weeks. Also, I'm trying a bunch of new things with this 'ole Update today, so <B>listen up</B>... Today's Update is so big, I've divided it up into two pieces, which you'll see as two separate posts on the newsboard... so in all reality, this is one-half of today's mega dosage of news. With that awesome note in mind, enjoy the Update...<p>{TAKE NOTICE: <I>The Following are all either original news items, and, if they're rumors, they're noted as such because they have yet to be substantiated or confirmed. Thanks.</I>}<p>[6/17 Update :: Part One of Two]<p>{-<I>Quick Thoughts Outta' Nowhere</I>-}<p>** I just finished reading the latest "Ross Report" from Good 'Ole JR. Jim's a good guy and he does keep us up-to-date with the latest scoops and such, but is this "JR's BBQ Sauce" happening, or not? He's babbled on [and on, and on...] about it for months now, and every time, it's "we're one-step closer to completing the Sauce..." Is it happening, or not?<p>** If I catch Mark Madden saying the phrase "Snoochie Boochie" once more... I'm done watching Nitro. <p>** If I turn on Nitro to see Scott Hudson without a shirt on just one more time... I'm done watching Nitro.<p>** If I see The Demon beat Vampiro anytime soon... I'm done watc... [you get the point].<p>** Yes, I've heard the rumors of Russo apparently "quitting" WCW. Although I didn't comment on it right away [since there was no Update yesterday], I'll throw in right now that Vince Russo means nothing to WCW. I think he's full of himself and whines. He might be the best WCW has right now, but with a little work, Ed Ferarra, Bill Banks and Terry Taylor can get the job done [if Russo indeed winds up leaving the company].<p>** I'm glad to see Paul Heyman stand his ground. TNN's been on this guy's back since he signed the friggin' contract, and now WWF and USA [indirectly] are butting in to make things worse. Paul's got a strong will, so we'll see how this whole scenario winds up.<p>** Notice the "...Outta Nowhere..." slice-of-the-title in this section? Well, in my humble opinion, The Godfather is done [and going nowhere -- fast] with that ridiculous gimmick. A return of Papa Shango would simply make my day.<p><B>-----Onto today's top stories...</B><p>I spoke with Bob Barnett, <a href="http://www.Vampiro.net"><B>Vampiro</B></A>'s agent, once again. Yesterday, Bob told me that the reason for Vampiro's near "walkout" of WCW was simply because Vince Russo's an idiot. Russo wanted Vampiro to do an angle with Asya that was totally against his morals and will, yet, Vince didn't care and it took all the help in the world to help the argument die down. On that note, Barnett told me that all of the guys backstage feel the same about Russo, in which it's either his way or the highway. Jumping back to Vampiro for just a 'sec, it appears as if the feud he's got goin' with The Demon is only happening due to the fact that WCW's got to follow strict orders from the contract they've got with KISS. As sad as that is, Vampiro's become a victim to it and now is working a program with 'Demon; quite a drop from his feud with Sting. Vampiro had some time to cool down last night, as he did spend the night in Las Vegas where he signed autographs for a bit, too, at WCW's "Nitro Grill."<p>While I'm on the subject of talking to those in the business, a close source of mine e-mails <a href="http://www.LillianGarcia.com"><B>Lillian Garcia</B></A> [WWF Ring Announcer] quite frequently. In one of their regular 'chat sessions' yesterday, my source tried to go in a little too deep, and actually asked Garcia who [as far as she knew] would win the "<a href="http://www.WWFKingoftheRing.com"><B>King of the Ring</B></A>" tournament. Garcia, as if teasing, said the following. "...<I>I don't know. I just.. don't know. And that's the fact. <B>**Its True, Its True.**</B></I>" Those stars might be the "girly-side" of her showing off, but ya' think she's messin' with us by saying Kurt Angle will win; hence the "It's True?"<p>So you all know, Cathy Dingman [BB], BobCat [the Ho that won the Hardcore Title at one point a few weeks ago], Tiger Ali Singh, Caryn Mower [Steph's brief fitness trainer] and Curtis Hughes [Jericho's old "bodyguard"], are all still under WWF contract. They're all under reevaluation, and the only ones that won't be back anytime soon are pretty much BB and Singh; only for the fact that BB made some major slip-up's close to two months ago now, and Singh's got an injury that's healing slower than doctors imagined. <p>As seen underneath, I've got a ton of mini-tidbits. They're all, if even, a couple-liner's, so enjoy [as noted with the bullets]... Oh, and to finish off "Part One," I've got a nice Trish Stratus piece [at the very bottom]...<p><LI> WWF's May PPV; "Judgment Day," scored 400,000 buys which is equivalent to a 1.07 buyrate. Officials are happy with the outcome.<p><LI> WCW's Jung Dragons are booked for Nitro and Thunder this week, after missing the Thunder/WorldWide taping this past Tuesday [that's got a much longer story, which I'll explain in Part Two later in the day].<p><LI> The Demon and Asya will both be at Nitro and Thunder this week.<p><LI> Christopher Daniels is also booked for Nitro. Thunder's still questionable.<p><LI> WCW's working on yet another set Nitro set, as wrestlers have been complaining about the ramp.<p><LI> Meng, despite reports, may still be under WCW contract. Stay tuned.<p><LI> Curt Hennig is very close to getting himself fired from WCW. Even though WWF's supposedly got no interest in Curt, they'd pick him up anyway to use as a low-blow to WCW.<p><LI> Disco Inferno may go under yet another name-change. It's possible it'll be under the influence of some sort of rap persona.<p><LI> Those who have been with WCW long enough are grumbling over the fact that <a href="http://www.LodiPage.com"><B>Lodi</B></A>'s been let-go. They felt he did nothing "wrong" and the reason he was out so long was due to the Standards and Practices -- not himself. Lodi was said to have been extremely well-liked; while Lenny Lane went, ironically, unmentioned.<p><LI> My buddy <a href="http://www.ShaneHelms.com"><B>Shane Helms</B></A> and the rest of 3 Count will be at Nitro this Monday; but it's not known if they'll be used on WCW TV. They'll definitely be used on Thunder, however.<p><LI> <a href="http://www.BobbytheBrain.com"><B>Bobby Heenan</B></A> missed the Thunder Taping last week because his wife was ill. Whatever caused him to miss that show won't happen again, as she's reportedly doing fine -- and Heenan will be back with WCW on Tuesday.<p><LI> Rey Mysterio Jr. and Juventud Guererra will wrestle singles matches starting next week.<p><LI> WCW trainee, Sean O'Hara, is booked for both Nitro and Thunder this week. He may be used as a R&B security guard at Nitro; or will just wrestle a dark match. Same goes for Thunder.<p><LI> Crowbar and Daffney may pair-up and feud with David Flair and Miss Hancock sometime down the road -- most likely later this summer.<p><LI> Interesting enough, WWF and WCW lost major sponsors this week. Burger King left WCW while WWF lost MCI. It's said that both cut their promotion due to "raunchy language."<p><LI> I chatted with <a href="http://www.LanceStorm.com"><B>Lance Storm</B></A> yesterday, and he told me he's definitely slated to make his WCW debut on Monday at Nitro. He'll also be at Thunder on the following day. In bigger news, Storm personally tells me that the rumors of him "joining the New Blood" are new to him, as he doesn't even know what role he's playing yet. He said the spiel with The New Blood may happen, but it'd be outta' pure luck by whomever guessed his role.<p><LI> Word out backstage in WCW is that Kim's "leaving" WCW is a work. Nearly all the wrestlers are stumped as to whether or not she legitimately quit, as most do feel it's entirely one big hoax. <p>Lastly, I've got a duo of <a href="http://www.TrishStratus.com"><B>Trish Stratus</B></A> tidbits... On the first note, there's a rumor going around that Trish has signed with a Canadian fitness and nutrition company, in which she may very well have her own line of nutrition bars or other supplement products. It'd be health food, if it happened, and it'd be exclusive to Canada. Secondly, Trish had the following to say when asked during her guest appearance on "Byte This" if she'd ever pose for Playboy; or nude for that matter...<p><I>...I am not against it [<B>posting nude</B>] but it is a situational thing and if it comes along again, I will think about it...</I><p><B>Don't Forget!!</B> "Part Two" of this Mega-Update hits the 'boards later in the day; probably between 2PM and 4PM. If you're reluctant to stay online for the second half, here's a quick preview of the news in-store...<p>*Kimberly in Playboy -- Chyna in Playboy -- Scott Hall's Return -- Jeff Hardy's Early [and very possible] Retirement -- Steven Regal's WWF Return -- ECW's Purchase -- WCW to be Bought-Out -- Scott Steiner and the WCW World Title -- Update on Blue Meanie -- WWF Memphis News -- WCW Tag-Teams and Cruiserweights -- The Rock in Florida -- and MUCH MORE....*<p>Adios.
