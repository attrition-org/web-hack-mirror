ECW on TNN Results 6/9<br>Announcers: Joey Styles, Joel Gertner<br>Taped from the Alario Center in New Orleans, LA<br>Credit: James Caldwell<p>We opened up by seeing Joey and Joel in the ring to welcome us to the show. Joey ripped on TNN then welcomed us to New Orleans. Joel grabbed the mic and did his usual intro with a description of his venture with the New Orleans ladies. Joey brought out Jazz, the female fighting phenom. Jazz said that she isn't the usual T&A found in the back because she has Talent & Ability. Justin Credible hit the ring from behind and caned Jazz. Francine came in and started a catfight with Jazz until Justin pulled Francine off her. Francine shook off Justin and gave Jazz more of a beating until Jazz was assisted out of the ring. Credible grabbed the mic and told us that Tommy Dreamer is the sacrificial lamb of ECW. Credible said that Jazz was another lamb that was slaughtered because Dreamer doesn't have the balls to get in the ring with him. Tommy Dreamer ran to the ring and tackled Credible starting a full-scale brawl until security hit the ring and stopped the brawl.<p>-Commercial-<p>In the back, Scotty Anton and Cyrus were talking about Anton's "great" gimmick. Anton suggested that he go to the ring and give Raven "the clap." Cyrus thought that would be a great idea.<p>Joel told us that Paul Heyman is responding to questions about TNN censoring ECW on ECWWrestling.com.<p>-Commercial-<p>We saw Raven sitting in the back. Raven said that Anton used to be his one eyed sidekick in WCW and now he's part of the Network and wonders if Anton really wants to leave behind that legacy.<p>Joel told us that Dawn Marie is set to return to ECW at the June 23rd show at the Rave in Milwaukee, WI. Also, ECW will finally be coming to Los Angeles, for the Heatwave PPV on Sunday, July 16th.<p>-Commercial-<p>Cyrus came to the ring with Scotty Anton. Cyrus encouraged us to do the clap under the leadership of Anton. The fans didn't seem to want to join in on the fun. Raven hit the ring then sat down in the corner as Anton stood on his knees and tried to encourage Raven to do the clap.<p>-Commercial-<p>Cyrus said that Raven has been having problems with Paul Heyman and at one time, Raven used to be a huge rating draw. Cyrus offered Raven a hand up on ECW and told Raven that he could be the #1 ratings draw on the planet if he joins the Network. Raven asked if he will get any promo time. Cyrus said that there's only enough promo time for himself. Cyrus told Raven to shake Anton's hand. Raven shook Anton's hand then clotheslined Anton to the mat starting the match.<p>Raven took Anton to the corner and landed ten punches to the head.. Raven took Anton to the outside and put him on the timekeeper's table. Raven climbed onto the apron then hopped up to the second rope and tried an elbow smash but Anton moved and Raven went crashing through the table and to the concrete floor below. Anton sent Raven back into the ring then sent him to the ropes and landed a hard dropkick. Anton sent Raven to the ropes then tackled Raven's knee flipping him over onto the mat. Anton landed kicks to the knee of Raven then went for a Sharpshooter but Raven kicked him off to the corner. Raven rolled to the corner then stood up and Anton kicked the knee some more. Anton took Raven to the ringpost and slammed Raven's knee into the ringpost. Anton landed some hard right hands then slammed the knee into the ringpost one more time. Anton did the clap then hopped into the ring where he landed right hands to the head of Raven. Anton sent Raven to the opposite corner then took too much time following up allowing Raven to land a clothesline and a knee lift. Raven pulled out the snot rag then drove it into the mouth of Anton. Cyrus slid a chair into the ring. Raven stole the chair from Anton then sent him into the seat of the chair with a Drop Toe Hold. Cyrus distracted the ref when Raven went for a cover then Raven got on the apron and confronted Cyrus. Anton rolled up Raven and scored a two then slapped on the Sharpshooter or as Anton calls it, the Clapper. Raven tapped out giving Anton the win.<p>In the back of the arena, the Baldies were gathered to tell us about their battles on the streets of New York City. Angel got riled up about New Jack then Grimes told Angel to not let New Jack get to him because they need to stay together. The Baldies reminded us that they rule the streets.<p>They aired a long video package recapping the beatings Justin Credible has given out over the years.<p>-Commercial-<p>Main Event time with Justin Credible and a partner of his choice against Tommy Dreamer and a partner of his choice. Credible hit the ring with Singapore Cane in hand and Francine by his side. Cyrus hit the ring with the ECW Television Champ, Rhino. Cyrus reminded us that he is the Network then the two climbed into the ring. Cyrus said that Credible is, without a doubt, the greatest ECW World Champ of all time. Cyrus wanted to destroy the heart and soul of ECW, Tommy Dreamer, and offered Credible the opportunity to take Rhino as his partner for the tag match. Credible accepted then out came Tommy Dreamer. Dreamer stood on the outside for a couple of minutes then Credible told Dreamer to get in the ring. Dreamer pulled out a beer instead and then the Sandman ran to the ring with ladder in hand. Dreamer and Rhino took the battle into the ring while Sandman took care of Credible on the outside. Dreamer dropped Rhino with a neckbreaker then Rhino slid to the outside where Dreamer sent Rhino into the ladder. Sandman took Credible into the ring then took the ladder into the ring with him and leaned it against the corner. Credible grabbed Sandman and sent Sandman upside down into the ladder. Credible stomped down on Sandman while Dreamer and Rhino brawled in the stands. In the ring, Credible slammed the ladder into Sandman's head. Sandman came back with left hands then wedged the ladder in the corner. Sandman sent Credible back first into the ladder then grabbed the ladder and leaned it against the top rope. Credible landed right hands then Sandman ducked a clothesline and hit a Russian Legsweep sending Credible into the ladder. Sandman landed left hands to the head then dropped Credible into the ladder with a bulldog. Sandman made a cover and scored a two count only. Rhino came back through the stands and climbed into the ring. Dreamer followed in and we had a four man brawl in the ring. Dreamer set up the ladder in the corner then landed right hands to Credible's head. Dreamer put Credible in the corner then tried a superplex, but Steve Corino came in and dropped Dreamer into the ladder crotch first. Before Corino hit the ring, the Sandman hit a top rope Heineken-rana then received a superkick from Corino. Tajiri hit the ring and superkicked Corino and Rhino. Sandman grabbed Credible and suplexed him into the ladder, which was leaning against the top rope. Scotty Anton hit the ring and landed right hands to Sandman's head. Rhino followed up with right hands to Sandman then Rob Van Dam hit the ring and side kicked Corino to the outside. RVD back body dropped Corino and Anton over the top to the outside then went after Rhino. Rhino went for a powerbomb, but RVD slipped out. Bill Alfonso tossed a chair to Rhino then RVD superkicked the chair into Rhino's face completing the Vandaminator. RVD hopped to the top then hit the Five Star Frog Splash. Sandman rolled over onto Rhino and pinned him giving Sandman and Dreamer the win.<p>After the match, the Network beat down on Sandman, RVD, Tajiri, and Dreamer. Anton slapped on the Clapper on RVD while Cyrus taunted the rest of the non-Network wrestlers to close the show.<p>
