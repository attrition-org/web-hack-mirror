By <a href="mailto:weirdkev@powerwrestling.com ">Kevin Gregg</a> on June 14, 2000<p>
Divas Interview with Chyna: She will be on the WWF Magazine!<p>Chyna will be on the cover of a future WWF Magazine, and WWFDivas.com had the chance to talk to Chyna. Here is what she had to say:<p><B>CHYNA TALKS ABOUT HER CHARACTER</B><br>Chyna says that for four years, people have always seen Chyna as being a body guard, and she never considered that one dimensional, because she did so much and broke so many grounds. It's intriguing for people to see that she portrays such a hard image. She wears make up all of the time, and people forget that she has to put it on. When she goes out to dinner on a personal side, she wears make up, dresses and anything to make her look good. That's a lot more of Joanie, and people always want to know more about what is behind the character. From a personal stand point, it's extremely rewarding, because for all of the hard work that she has done, the ultimate in femininity for her is to be able to carry muscle, be smart, athletic, pretty and physically attractive. That is what they are trying to portray, and she says that it's sometimes hard to portray that to today's society, and it's great to get out there today and portray that image.<p><B>CHYNA DISCUSSES THE SHOOT</B><br>Chyna says that they were shooting a cover shot for the WWF magazine, and what they were trying to do is present one of the many sides of Chyna. It just happened to be one of her softer sides. She says that she didn't want to do the in your face, T&A type of shot. That is not very Chyna, and there is a way to display a lot of softness of her with feathers and jewelry.<p><B>CHYNA DESCRIBES HER LOOK</B><br>She says that she thinks they achieved the effect of the make up, and it wound up being a girlie effect. Every girl likes to play with a boa, and it's just a very early item. They tried to match the make up with that, soft pink lips, and more of a natural eye type. It's to show a little bit more of Joanie as well as Chyna. Her look is a lot different when she goes to the ring, and she's much harder edged. It allows her to show a softer side, and they do it through color, hair style and accessories.<p><B>CHYNA AT THE SHOOT</B><br>Chyna says she thinks that she is one of the very few people who have been able to show both sides. For a long time, she was only able to show one side, and it's not a side that was looked at the way it is now. She can show strength, have some muscle, and she can be smart, dress up and be pretty. She can have fun with it, smile, and laugh and whack someone when she's done!<p><B>COVER GIRL</B><br>This is one of the easier photo shoots that she has done, simply because it was a lot more of Joanie. She says that she felt very relaxed, and it was fun. It's fun to be dressed up like a barbie doll, and that's where they were going, with the Chyna Doll. They dressed her up in feathers, and she was sweet as ice cream, and just as cold.<p><B>A DIFFERENT SIDE OF CHYNA</B><br>She worked four different wraps, and one had sort of an eye lash curl to it, and to her, it was very glamorous. Her favorite was probably the traditional feather boa, with all of the feathers popping out. Chyna says that she had a real hairy like boa that was very soft. They all gave a tad bit of a different effect, and a different look. She had a ton of jewelry and it was a lot of fun to wear.<p><B>THE NINTH WONDER OF THE WORLD</B><br>Her favorite look isn't Chyna, because she is very proud of the way Joanie looks. She is a confident woman, and she wears her make up, soft colors as usual. Most of the time, she is casually dressed. She wears a lot of work out outfits, and she's happy the way she looks. It's fun to be able to embellish herself into Chyna, and a glam type of look. Her favorite look is herself.<p>Credit: WWFDivas.com.<p><B>Wreckage 2000: Bill Watson lets out humor (Preview)</B><br>Please note: This Wreckage is in two parts, which means the first part is written before the Great American Bash, and the second part will be written on like Tuesday or whenever I decide to get off my lazy a$$ and do something about it. So this first page is BEFORE the American Bash so I don't want any hate mails like "Yer Stoopid doode" or "The Gr8 American Bash wuz yesterday doode." Because people are just f**king idiots. =) Well, there will be no a$$ or Hero of the week, because I am too lazy to do them, but what I did do for you is get you this funny a$$ picture of ...??<br><I>[Follow the link below to get to the rest of Bill Watson's Wreckage 2000!]</I>
