He just wanted to screw Bischoff.<p>Jeff Jarrett comes out to defend the World Title against Billy Kidman.

At one point, Midajah did her cross body on the Cat. In the end, Stiener got the Stiener Recliner. Cat gives up and Stiener wins. Cat grabs the mic and says that the Stiener Recliner is an illegal chokehold and the Cat reversed the match.<p>Crowbar came out to take on David Flair. Very slow paced match with Crowbar controlling most of the match. David has improved a lot as a wrestler.
