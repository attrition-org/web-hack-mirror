By <a href="mailto:deaconheat@aol.com">Mikey G</a> on June 17, 2000<p>
Here's the second part of today's Double-header Update; as I've got another truckload of news for your minds to take in. Enjoy the Update...<p>[NOTE: <I>The news found below are all either originals or have been taken from the newswire. Each post can be easily noticed whether or not which category it fits into. Thanks.</I>]<p>First off, there's talks that in the next week, major happenings could go down... WCW could be bought out by SFX as soon as Monday afternoon, while Jay Hassman; former WCW Executive, has offered Paul Heyman a nice sum of money to sell 50.1% of the company over to he and his men. We'll see what happens one week from now...<br>  <br>So you guys know, Bill Banks, Ed Ferrara and Terry Taylor will resume Vince Russo's booking while he's on hiatus. Nitro's script is being worked on as we speak and will be crafted and edited throughout the weekend. It's said that Kanyon and Disco Inferno will also input just a 'bit on their idea's for the shows. It's unknown of this team will permanently take over for Vince.<p>Independent valet and Pro Wrestler "The Blak Widow," better known to her hardcore fans as Amanda Storm, has wrote Pro Wrestling's next autobiography. In the book, which has already hit shelves, she talks about her first year in 'Wrestling. Below is the cover of her book...<p><img src="http://www.gerweck.net/blak.jpg"><p>This past week, WCW released The Villano's, El Dandy, La Parka, Silver King and Psychosis; but here's the lowdown...<p>*Villano's and El Dandy are going back to EMLL and AAA down in Memphis. It's said that they're finally happy and are glad to be back ... so best of luck to those two.<p>*La Parka and Silver King are being closely looked at and evaluated by ECW. Once the whole TNN mess is cleared up, they'll be handled as two top priorities. <p>*WWF's expressed interest in Psychosis. I'll keep you updated. <p>Tomorrow's Father's Day, so what better way to throw in an early tidbit related to wrestlers' and their sons. The following is Whoo! Wrestling's description of <a href="http://www.TheRock.com"><B>The Rock</B></A> spending some time with his 'pops; Rocky Johnson...<p><I>The Peterson benefit wasn't the only big card in Florida last weekend. On June 10th in Davie, FL, the Future of Wrestling presented a big event. The Fabulous Ones, Stan Lane & Steve Keirn, teamed up together in Florida for the first time in several years, losing to Anthony Adonis & Billy Fives. Harry Venis, who is the mayor of Davie, wrestled and defeated Soulman Alex G. Venis was accompanied to the ring by <B>Rocky Johnson</B>, and spotted backstage at the event was Johnson's son Duane, better known as <B>The Rock.</B></I><p><a href="http://www.LiveAudioWrestling.com"><B>The LAW</B></A> broke the story this past weekend that Steven Regal's being moved back up to WWF's "TV" Roster. I can confirm to you he won't be on TV at RAW or Smackdown [or, at least that's how things look now], but rather, he'll wrestle dark matches for both nights or possibly even a Jakked or Metal taping.<p>I'm a frequent to check out wrestlers' official websites, and I breezed by <a href="http://www.TheBlueMeanie.com"><B>TheBlueMeanie.com</B></A>; the official online home for WWF's Blue Meanie. Anyway, nothing' really new on the site, but he did mention that he and Jasmine St. Claire are officially an "item," and 'da Blue Guy said it's actually pretty serious. Jasmine visits him all the time, and Meanie says they'll continue to "go steady" until he decides to move onto the next level [how sweet].<p>Speaking of Meanie, it appears as if he's the one standup for Memphis tag-team, The Mullets. By that, I mean that Meanie is the only thing that has prevented WWF from releasing the team from their developmental contract. The Mullets are said to be very weird guys backstage and such ... so weird that no-one really talks to them and they keep to themselves. However, they've found a friend in Meanie who, in return, has really kept their jobs safe.<p>With all the references on WCW TV lately referring to Scott Hall, it appears as if Hall's return will happen sometime soon. Officials are still after a medical clearance, as without that he's really no use to the company. His neck is nearly healed and once he's back, it's expected he'll play a major upper-hand part having to do with Nash, Bischoff and so forth. Stay tuned...<p><a href="http://www.1wrestling.com"><B>Bob Ryder</B></A>, while on "WCW: Live!" the other night, said that Great Muta will not come to WCW for the ten-day swing, as talked about and planned. Instead, WCW may acquire some other talent from over east, but it appears as if Muta's definitely not happening due to problems with his work visa.<p>Scott Steiner is said to be due for a giant push before the summer's end -- so big, that he might wind up with the WCW World Title going into August's PPV. I'm hearing a layout that would have Hogan beating Jeff Jarrett at next months' "Bash at the Beach," in which the next night on Nitro, a Hogan vs. Goldberg match would be setup. If Goldberg were to win that night and the plans turn up right, then a Big Poppa Pump vs. Goldberg feud may run in tact all the way out through this summer's end.<p>Straight from the mouth of Matt Hardy [via <a href="http://www.MattandJeffHardy.com"><B>MattandJeffHardy.com</B></A>], here's some scary news on his little brother; Jeff. It appears as if all the bumps Jeff's taken lately have paid off seriously on his body, but I'll stop yapping and let Matt tell it like it is...<p>"...<I>Speaking of health, let's talk about my baby brother, Jeff Hardy. For the last month, he's been plagued with a severe pain in his side. At first they thought it was his appendix, but it wasn't. To add to the original pain, he acquired a terrible case of food poisoning. The doctors then thought he had an infected gall bladder, and they prescribed him some antibiotics and other medicines. It turns out that his gall bladder is okay, but they still haven't been able to pinpoint the problem. The medications have stopped his pain for the last week and he feels relatively normal. Its almost frightening to me all of the abuse his body takes from his wrestling style combined with our unbelievablely exhausting schedule. Both of us, especially Jeff, are always susceptible to dangerous internal injuries with what we do. I hope Jeff's pain stays gone and he is fine. God-willing, we will both be healthy as long as possible while in this business</I>..." <p>Lastly, I wanna' clear up the whole Playboy ordeal...<p>-- <a href="http://www.DDPBang.com"><B>KIMBERLY</B></A> was supposed to; and <B>will</B> pose for Playboy's "Women in Sports" issue, however, it won't be nude. This 'posing' has nothing to do with her 'quitting' WCW, if that winds up true, despite rumors.<p>-- CHYNA will be in the same issue, as talked about in the past, and she will also be appearing <B>CLOTHED.</B> I'm sure it'll be revealing for all those moaning out there, but nonetheless, she's holding up to her promise to Playboy, as well. <p>Adios.
