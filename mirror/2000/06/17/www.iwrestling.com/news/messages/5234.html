By <a href="mailto:anthonyschilero@hotmail.com">Anthony Schilero</a> on June 14, 2000<p>
<li>The Heat Wave PPV will take place on 7/16 at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, which will be the first West Coast appearance of the promotion. The appearance in Los Angeles may also have significance as it pertains to XPW being based in Los Angeles.<p><li>After the end of the match in Pensacola where the Sandman was out there in no condition to be out there and the match was ruined, there was a lot of backstage yelling and even blows thrown involving Sandman, Dreamer and Victory. The Dreamer-Sandman altercation which occurred after the match was quickly broken up before any harm was done. Victory and Sandman then started an argument in the bathroom which led to a fight where Sandman poked Victory in the eyes and Victory gave Sandman a few quick head-butts before it was broken up. Sandman came out of the bathroom bleeding from his forehead and above the eye and Victory has some minor swelling.<p><li>The TV tapings this week took place on 6/10 in Pittsburgh before 2,700 fans, of which 2,300 were paid. Backstage the morale wasn't good because of the paychecks being one to three weeks late. There wasn't much new, as they did a similar angle with Cyrus, Joey Styles and Joel Gertner that they've been doing, including Rhino spearing Gertner, Tommy Dreamer saving Styles and Van Dam cleaning house with a big dive at the end. There were several newcomers, most impressive of which was Carl Pierre Oullett, back using his Jean Pierre Lafitte WWF name, who had a really good squash win over H.C. Loc. Another newcomer was E.Z. Money who juiced real big in one of the New Jack run-ins. The show was said to have two really good matches, another Credible win over Lynn which ended when Rhino put Lynn through a table to set up the pin, and Van Dam over Guido, which was compared with the level of the early Van Dam-Lynn house show matches from a few years back. The crowd was hot but there wasn't money spent on production so the building may not look good. <p><li>6/9 TNN show was taped in New Orleans. It had a total indie look with all the empty seats visible even around the ringside area. At the beginning, they tried to build the show heavily around Dawn Marie, which is always a sign of desperation when you use T&A as the main focus of the show instead of garnish to complement the big programs. Jazz came out for an interview to start the show saying her T&A stands for talent and ability. Credible caned her and pounded on her. This footage was totally digitized. Francine then jumped her wearing this tiny skirt that flew up, which wasn't digitized. I guess women can beat up women. And men can beat up some women as we've also seen on this show. I'm not sure if white men can't beat up black women, or men simply can't beat up short women. Cyrus & Anton did a promo. I don't know why, but whenever Cyrus talks about demographics, it's cracks me up. Heyman then put over the web site where his uncensored comments that didn't air on the previous week's show were up. They were better off censored after reading them. They started pushing the return of Dawn Marie at the TV tapings on 6/23. Cyrus then tried to recruit Raven, since he, once, was a ratings draw. It was about a half hour into a one hour show before we finally had a match (granted, WWF did that on Monday, but at least they had a two hour show). Anton beat Raven clean with a sharpshooter, which they called the clapper in 5:32. They did a long Credible & Francine video. Finally the main event saw Dreamer & Sandman over Rhino & Credible in 6:23. This looked like a WCW match. Corino, Tajiri and Anton all ran in right in front of the ref, but he didn't seem to even make an effort to care. Van Dam finally made the save like a really athletic version of Nash. Well, actually not, because Van Dam sold at the end. Van Dam gave Rhino the five-star frog splash and Sandman got the pin. Then Van Dam got beaten down and Anton put him in the clapper while Credible pounded on Sandman with cane shots and the show ended with the Network leaving the babyfaces laying.<p><li>Raven's lower leg swelled up after having it wrapped around the post last weekend. He worked on it on 6/9 in Erie, PA but was limping badly and couldn't put any weight on it so missed the TV tapings the next night.<p><a href="http://www.iowrestling.com"><b>*IOWRESTLING.COM*-*Come see *SEXY WET* Photos of Trish Stratus and Terri!
