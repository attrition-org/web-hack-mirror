He isn't a wrestler, nor is he involved in the wrestling business, but this column will definitely be wrestling related. I am talking about none other than Mario. Yes, that Mario. The Super Mario Brothers Mario. Why has he gotten so much of a push over the years? What did he do to earn it? Sure, it was good when I was young, starting with Super Mario Brothers one, but did they go too far with Mario?<br><A HREF="http://wwf.powerwrestling.com/articles/061100125223.html">[<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">click for more</FONT>]</A><p><I>[Please do not use this report without proper credit to Kevin Gregg and PowerWrestling.com]</I>
