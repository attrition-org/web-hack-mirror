By <a href="mailto:weirdkev@powerwrestling.com ">Kevin Gregg</a> on June 15, 2000<p>
WWF Smackdown! results: 6/15<br>Commentators: Michael Cole and Jerry "The King" Lawler<br>Report by: Kevin Gregg of PowerWrestling.com<p>WWF Smackdown! starts off with footage from this past Monday night when a match was set for The Rock, The Undertaker and Kane against Triple H, Shane and Vince McMahon for the King of the Ring. Linda McMahon made that match, and she also put Shane and Vince in a tag team tables match against the Dudley Boyz! Chris Jericho also got another shot at the WWF belt against Triple H, and the match was extremely close, but Triple H was able to come out on top. Later in the night, Kane and The Rock were forced to go against each other, because the Regime took pictures of Kane's face, and they were going to show the world, but GTV proved that the pictures weren't able to be developed. <p><I><CENTER><B><U>King of the Ring Qualifying Match</U><br>Grandmaster Sexay vs. Edge</B></CENTER></I>The Rock and Kane then hammered away on the McMahon/Helmsley Faction. Too Cool's music is playing in the arena, and they are on their way to the ring as the WWF Tag Team Champions. Grandmaster Sexay is going against Edge in this King of the Ring Qualifying match. Christian comes out to the ring with Edge, and to start off the match, Grandmaster Sexay and Edge lock up in the middle of the ring. Grandmaster Sexay gives Edge a side head lock, and then Edge whips him off the ropes. Grandmaster takes Edge down with a shoulder block. Edge goes for a high cross body, but Grandmaster Sexay is able to duck it. <p>Grandmaster Sexay slams the head of Edge into the turnbuckle, and then he goes to the second rope and nails Edge with a missle drop kick. Grandmaster Sexay grabs the arm of Edge and works on it, and then Edge rakes Grandmaster in the eyes. Edge whips Grandmaster off the ropes, and he goes for a back body drop, but Grandmaster kicks him in the chest. Grandmaster then clotheslines Edge to the outside of the ring, and Christian is able to help Edge to his feet. Grandmaster Sexay gives Edge and Christian a baseball slide to knock them down. Too Cool then dance together. Edge slams Grandmaster Sexay into the steel steps, and then he slams his head into the steel steps. <p>Edge rolls Grandmaster back into the ring and he gives him a double ax handle. Edge slams Grandmaster's head into the turnbuckle, and then he kicks away on him. Edge whips Grandmaster to the corner, and Grandmaster falls down in the corner. Edge picks Grandmaster up and gives him a body slam. Edge goes off the ropes, and he nails him with an elbow drop. Edge covers Grandmaster Sexay for a two count, and then he goes for a suplex, but Grandmaster blocks it and puts Edge on the top rope. Grandmaster gives Edge a number of right hands, and then he whips Edge off the ropes. Grandmaster gives Edge an Enziguri, and then he picks him up and gives him a body slam. <p>Grandmaster Sexay goes to the top rope and Edge knocks Grandmaster down before he can do anything. Grandmaster Sexay is able to regain control, and he goes into a sunset flip into a power bomb. Grandmaster pins Edge for a two count, and then he grabs hold of Christian. Edge tries to charge at Grandmaster, but Grandmaster moves out of the way and Edge hits Christian. Grandmaster rolls Edge up for a two count, and then he gives him a neck breaker. Grandmaster Sexay goes to the top rope, and he gets out his goggles.<p>Christian goes to knock Grandmaster down, but Scotty is able to stop him. Grandmaster Sexay gives Edge the hip hop drop, and Shane McMahon comes to the ring with a steel chair and he nails Grandmaster Sexay with it. Edge is then able to pin Grandmaster Sexay to get the win to advance in the King of the Ring tournament. The Faction is shown backstage, and Vince says that thanks to Shane, phase one is complete, and then they leave to have some fun!<br><I><CENTER><B><U>Winner</U> - Edge</B></CENTER></I><p>Vince McMahon and the rest of the McMahon/Helmsley Faction are all on their way to the ring, and they have got to be frustrated because of Linda McMahon. The fans give the Faction a negative reaction as they get in the ring, and Shane gets on the mic and says "This just in..." For whatever reason, Edge and Christian have challenged the very tag team that Vince McMahon defeated in this very ring last Monday night. So tonight, in this very ring, Edge and Christian will be taking on none other than the Dudley Boyz. By the way, Edge and Christian have been gracious enough prior to their match, so get your cameras ready for a special photo opportunity of Edge and Christian. <p>Vince gets on the mic and says that on last Monday night, his charming, darling, CEO wife, Linda came down to the ring, and she decided that she was going to make a match. She made a match up with Stephanie defending her WWF Women's Championship. The fans weren't applauding after the match was over, because Stephanie is still the WWF Women's Champion. The fans cheered when Linda made a match with Vince and Shane in a table match against the Dudleys. They weren't cheering because of the McMahons victory. The fans really thought the CEO accomplished something when she made a match with Triple H defending the WWF title against someone he didn't know. <p>The fans weren't too happy with the result, because Triple H is still the Game, and the World Wrestling Federation Champion. The fans probably thought it was a good idea when Linda prevented Kane, the Undertaker and The Rock from tearing each other apart. She decided that they should unify and at the King of the Ring, Kane, the Undertaker and The Rock will compete against the threesome of Shane McMahon, Vince McMahon and Triple H. There are some out there that say that this could win match of the year honors, because the vast majority of the fans are thinking, unbalance. There is no telling who is going to win this match. Both teams have equal abilities. There are some who think The Rock's team has the edge, and there may be an even smaller amount of you that think that Triple H's team doesn't have a chance.<p>Triple H has an opinion on the subject, and Triple H gets on the mic and says that he's got an opinion alright. His opinion is that he has never been more confident in a team to be successful than he is that team right there. With Vince McMahon, the Giant Killer, and the Game on one team, they are virtually unstoppable. Triple H says that he is so sure of that, that it's almost not even fair. It is a great match, but it's almost unfair. Triple H says that they are going to take the match that Linda made, as great as it is, and they are going to make it even better. There seems to be some confusion as to who the number one contender is for the WWF Championship.<p>Is it Kane? Is it the Undertaker? Is it The Rock? The problem is that you really don't know, so at the King of the Ring, we are going to solve all of that. In one match, they are going to get it all done. They are going to put the number one contendership on the line. In the unlikely event that Linda's team can beat them, the person that gets that victory will then be deemed the number one contender, and he will defend his World Wrestling Federation Championship against that person in July. That seems like a good deal. Can the Undertaker trust that Kane won't stab him in the back for a shot at the belt? Can you really trust that The Rock won't stab the Undertaker and Kane in the back for a shot at the belt?<p>On Linda's team, it seems that no one can trust anyone, and Triple H says that he has always heard it said that there is no "I" in team. Triple H says that he has successfully put the "I" in team, because it will be about who wants it more, the Undertaker, Kane or The Rock. In the likely event that Triple H's team is victorious, then out of those three, nobody gets a shot at the WWF belt, he will give the number one contender's slot to the winner of the King of the Ring, and he will defend the World Wrestling Federation Championship against that person. Vince tells the fans to give it up for Triple H!<p>Vince then continues talking, and he says that Shane has a surprise for the Dudley Boyz, and in this very ring, Chris Jericho, Y2J is going to have a nice, or not so little surprise when the Undertaker arrives here tonight. The Undertaker will be greeted with a special surprise. Kane will see action here tonight, and Kane will square off against? Vince says that if he told everyone, it wouldn't be a surprise. The Rock will also see WWF action in this very ring tonight, but against who? Vince starts to say, and Triple H tells Vince that the information should be on a need to know basis, and the pieces of crap known as the fans don't need to know!<p>A taxi is shown, and Pat Patterson, Michael Chiota and Gerald Brisco are in it. Another taxi comes up from behind, and Crash says that he needs to find someone, because he needs protection. Brisco, Patterson and the referee get out of the limo, and they argue.<p><I><CENTER><B>T&A vs. the Hardy Boyz</B></CENTER></I>T&A are on their way to the ring along with Trish Stratus, and they are going against the Hardy Boyz in tag team action. Jeff and Test start it off in the ring, and Jeff kicks Test in the gut a number of times, and then he goes to whip Test to the corner, but Test reverses it.

Albert splashes Matt in the corner, and then Test gives Matt a boot to the face, and then he pins Matt to get the win. After the contest, Albert holds Jeff and Trish slaps him across the face.

Lita then goes to the second rope and gives Trish a leg drop.<br><I><CENTER><B><U>Winner</U> - T&A</B></CENTER></I><p>The Undertaker is shown in the backstage area and he has arrived on Smackdown!. A number of police are there to greet him, and Vince shows up and asks what we have here. It's an American Bad A$$. Bull Buchanan is with him, and Vince welcomes the Undertaker to Chicago. Vince reminds the Undertaker of who he nailed and stole the car of on Monday. The man that he stole the car of went to get a warrant for the arrest of the Undertaker. Vince tells the police to arrest the Undertaker and the police cuff him up. Vince says that the Undertaker is not such a bad a$$ after all.<p>The Undertaker tells the police that Bull stole his bike.

D'Lo Brown starts it off with a kick to the face of Scotty 2 Hotty and he gives him a couple of right hands, then he whips him off the ropes and goes for aback body drop, but Scotty kicks him in the gut. D'Lo tries to throw Scotty to the outside of the ring, but Scotty lands on the apron. Scotty flings himself back into the ring and then Scotty nails D'Lo with a right hand.
