New Jack fought back and used the pizza cutter on Grimes and a snow shovel. Grimes battled back as they went to the outside and into the crowd. They went over into the concession area. At this point it was hard to follow the action because of the amount of people in the area as they rushed it so they cut a long shot for a few seconds. Grimes grabbed a table when they got back close and was attacking New Jack and placed him on a table as New Jack was busted open. Grimes then grabbed a second table and placed it on top of New Jack. Grimes climbed to some scaffolding. New Jack got off the table and climbed up the scaffold that looked to the 10 to 12 feet over the ground.

He ran down ECW till Paul Heyman came out with and cut a swearing laced promo. Gertner then came down and gave a similar promo saying that TNN from tonight on was going down. Match starts out with Crazy taking control with speed but Rhino slowed him and took the match to the floor where Rhino used powermoves.
