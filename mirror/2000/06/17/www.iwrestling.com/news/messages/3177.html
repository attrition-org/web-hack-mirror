By <a href="mailto:wrestl4@earthlink.net">Robert Pasbani</a> on April 3, 19100 at 23:14:18<p>
WCW Monday Nitro Recap<br>Report by Tyler Riggs<p>The blue WCW logo is still here, and we open into a large, empty arena. Tony and Mark tell us that next week is a brand new era in WCW, as Eric Bischoff and Vince Russo formerly of the World Wrestling Federation will take control. Tonight however, we are going to take a look at the best of the past 5 years of Nitro. Mark says Nitro took wrestling to a new level, and talks about how Eric Bischoff was key in implementing Nitro. Mark recaps how Bischoff started as an announcer and climbed the ranks to the top.<p>Our first recap is Ted Turner announcing the signing of Hulk Hogan, and signing the match between Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair for Bash at the Beach. The then WCW Commissioner gives contracts to Hogan and Flair. Then a recap on Hulk Hogan's signing and his early career in WCW, showing up at BATB with Mr. T, and his defeat of Flair, and Shaquille O'Neil handing Hogan the belt. We see Hogan beating up men of the likes of Vader, Meng, Arn Anderson, Flair, The Giant. Lots of Hogan, Hogan on Saturday Night, Hogan-Mania.<p>Back to Tony and Mark and they say it was a year after Hulk arrived that the ball really started to roll, when Nitro arrived. Tony says it was Eric's vision to have a show up against Raw, Tony says he remembers thinking Bischoff was crazy for that idea. Tony sends us to the Mall of America for the very first Nitro, when we return.<p>-Commercial Break-<p>The OLD Nitro opening shows up, and we go into the Mall of America, for the very beginning, of the very first Nitro. Eric Bischoff and Steve McMichael are commentating. Tony talks about being very nervous about the show as a producer, and walking around the mall for hours. We cut into...<p>MATCH 1: Jushin "Thunder" Liger vs. Brian Pillman<p>Liger has Pillman on the mat and goes to the top rope for a dive, but Pillman hits a dropkick on Liger on the way down. Whip into the ropes, Liger hits a short powerbomb on Pillman, but he kicks out. Liger hits a hurracanrana off the top rope, but once again, Pillman kicks out at two. Liger sits Pillman on the top rope, and hits a tornado DDT on Liger, but only gets a two count. Standing switch, with Pillman rolling Liger up and getting the win.<p>WINNER: Brian Pillman<p>Tony and Mark reminisce about that Nitro, and Tony walked backstage and saw Lex Luger, and realized that Bischoff had plucked Luger away from the WWF. We go back to the Mall of America, and the Nitro opening sequence again.<p>We see more clips from Liger vs. Pillman, mostly the highspots, Liger having Pillman in the reverse surfboard, and the win by Pillman. We cut into Sting and Flair fighting, with Lex Luger showing up. Sting jumps over Flair a few times, and body presses Flair. Sting throws Flair off the top rope, but Arn Anderson comes out, as Flair gets laid out by Sting. Arn Anderson gets in and attacks Flair, causing the DQ. World Champion Hulk Hogan comes out, for his match with Big Bubba. We see Hogan kick out from Big Bubba's big slam, Hogan hulks up and finishes off Big Bubba (Big Bossman).<p>Tony tells us they will be back with what happened at Memorial Day the next year...NWO<p>-Commercial Break-<p>Mark says Eric Bischoff made WCW Cool.<p>We looks at the American Males (Bagwell and Riggs) righting Flair and Anderson. Bagwell had Flair beat, but Woman scratched Bagwell's eyes, and Flair and Arn won. We see Scott Hall showing up in the ring, saying that if WCW Wants a war, they will get one. We see DDP getting a win over the Pit Bull, and then the Shark coming out for a fight against World Champion, The Giant. Giant chokeslams The Shark and beats him. Television Champion Lex Luger next, getting a win. Scott Steiner vs. Stinger, back when both were in their orginal form, and Steiner no steroids. Scott Hall showing up at the Announcer booth, with him saying that "We" were taking over. <p>We look at a recap of WCW's great Cruiserweight Division, a division no one could dupicate, Chris Jericho, Dean Malenko, Rey Mysterio, Ultimo Dragon, Eddy Guerrero, we look at some Eddy Guerrero and Dean Malenko matches, but guess where they are now!...We see Benoit/Wild Pegassus, Konnan, we look at some Rey Mysterio Jr. Matches when he still had his mask, Chris Jericho matches against Konnan, Malenko, Psychosis matches against Rey Mysterio, Juventud Guerrera.<p>Tony talks about how they needed one thing to get the WCW over the hump, and they knew that Bischoff was thinking up something big, and we will have that story when we come back.<p>-Commercial Break-<p>Tony talks about Scott Hall showing up, and how everyone was shocked, and how the next week, Kevin Nash followed.<p>Kevin Nash shows up and says that they aren't here to play. We see Nash powerbombing Bischoff through the Great American Bash stage. We cut to Bash at the Beach when Hogan arrives and Leg drops Randy Savage, and reveals himself as the third man. The beginning of the greatest angle in history. Hogan told the fans to stick it, and they all did, they stuck to their TV's watching the nWo.<p>We cut to where the camera went to the backstage for the first time ever, the nWo had laid out Buff Bagwell, and they were attacking Scotty Riggs and AA and threw Rey Mysterio into a trailer. The nWo got in their limo, and Macho Man jumped on the limo and went with them. <p>-Commercial Break-<p>We look at when Eric Bischoff revealed he was part of the nWo. Eric Bischoff admits, Hulk is the man. We see some of the nWo's rampage on the company, their attacks, Rodman, Bischoff's Souled out speech, The hostile takeover, and the addition of many jobbers to the nWo. The first edition of nWo monday nitro. We see Randy "Pee Wee" Anderson being fired by Bischoff, and the sadness ensued. We see Pee Wee showing up with his kids, and Bischoff telling the kids to tell his dad that he's still fired. Harvey Schiller shows up, and suspends Bischoff, to the great delight of the fans. We see Bischoff telling JJ Dillong to "Bite Me". <p>We move into the transformation of Sting, Sting's "farewell" speech, and the first appearance of Sting in the rafters with his Crow. We see a couple Scorpion Death Drops on various nWo members, and the world famous words "The only thing for sure about the Stinger is, that nothin's for sure".<p>-Commercial Break-<p>We take a look at some of the highlights of the ORIGINAL Nitro Girls. <p>Mark says alot of people think Bischoff can't beat McMahon again, even with Russo's help, Madden asks how anyone knows that (Good Point). Madden thinks he can do it. <p>We recap the 100th Edition of Nitro, with the main event being Lex Luger vs. Hollywood Hogan for the World Title. We see Luger promising he'd be the World Champion that night. The Giant took out three cruiserweights that evening, Sting was in the rafters, and JJ Dillon said it's been a year since anyone talked to Sting, JJ Dillon said WCW needs Sting to fight the nWo. JJ Dillon says he wants to rebuild the trust, and he has a contract, and he has an opponent for him, a match against Curt Hennig, Sting takes the contract, rips it in half, and gives it back to Dillon. Hogan and Luger match is then shown, Luger having the advantage of Hogan, and Hogan getting a couple of two counts on Luger. Hogan missing his legdrop, Luger with his finishing sequence, and everyone in the nWo trying to stop Luger, Luger putting Hogan in the rack, and winning the title, and the celebration with Giant, Sting, DDP, Glacier, and the nWo throwing tables backstage. <p>Tony and Mark talk about the start of Goldberg.<p>-Commercial Break-<p>We watch clips of Goldberg vs. Hugh Morrus, and see the fans cheering Hugh on against Goldberg. Goldberg puts Hugh Morrus up in the Jackhammer for the first time, looks into the camera and says "That's number 1". That was in Salt Lake City...You know, where I am from. :)<p>A video clip of Goldberg is shown, his career, championships, amtches, and so forth. <p>-Commercial Break-<p>Mark talks about how Vince McMahon was getting his butt kicked week in and week out, and he turned to Vince Russo and they introduced the concept of Crash TV. The screen reads that Eric Bischoff has a lot of problems, Hulk Hogan needed a break, shows Bischoff making Hogan get knee surgery. Several wrestlers claimed to be hurt like Bret Hart. Scott Hall had his personal problems. Eric Bischoff and his fued both personally and professionally with Ric Flair. We see interviews from the Flair/Bischoff feud, and the Ric Flair heart attack angle, and Bischoff coming out and giving his apology interview, we see Ric Flair strip down in the ring, and put his career on the line in a match, against control of WCW the day after Starrcade. Bischoff takes Flair's money out of his pants, and says the match is on. We see Bischoff running out of the arena, and gets in a limo, but Benoit, Malenko and Mongo carry him back to the ring, the nWo run in on the match, but the Horsemen stop them, more nWo comes out, and Macho Man comes out in an nWo shirt, and helps Flair out, and Flair gets control of WCW (One of my personal favorite moments of wrestling). <p>-Commercial Break-<p>We go to Las Vegas for the first Nitro with the new set, and the four way dance for the world title with Flair, Hogan, DDP and Goldberg. Nash came down to save Hogan from getting pinned, and Goldberg becomming the champion, Sting dropped from the rafters, which led to the Spring Stampede main event that year.<p>-Commercial Break-<p>Scenes from the first days of the Russo era are shown, clips from Halloween Havoc where Hogan left, and Goldberg fighting Sting, with Goldberg winning the world title , and the next day on Nitro, where the face paint-less Sting confronting JJ Dillon wanting his title back, and the start of the 32 Man Tournament.

Flair says to call his lawyer, and he needs more than 10 seconds, Disco says he wants lights for his entrance. <p>Madden says things can either be great, or can go very bad.
