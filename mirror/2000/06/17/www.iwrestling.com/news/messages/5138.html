WCW Monday Nitro Report for 6/12/00<br>Live from Richmond, VA<br>Report by WrestleWomen.net<p>Vince Russo and Eric Biscoff enter the arena and talk about how big the big surprise was. Goldberg then comes out and explains the reason he did this was because when he was injured, all of the Millionaires Club members tried to backstab him when he was injured and the fans cheered them. Nash comes out and says Goldberg didn't make Goldberg, but rather members of the Millionaires Club did. He then tries to get to the ring but cops stopped him and cuffed him. Russo said that he wanted ratings and tonight it will be Goldberg vs. Nash.<p>Backstage, Jarrett sees The Cat and asks him to book Hogan/Jarrett tonight. Cat says fine.<p>In the back of the arena, Nash is put in a squat car and will stay there until the main event.<p>Big Vito defended the Hardcore Title against Terry Funk. Backstage, Vito was talking to Johnny the Bull who said he was sick, so Vito locked Johnny in his locker room. He was approaching the ring as Funk attacked him. They wrestled a great hardcore match, all over the building. Funk took a bump from the stage to a table at one point. In the end, there was a table placed on the floor at ringside, and from the apron, Vito piledrove Funk and won the match. After, Funk shook Vito's hand, turned around and got attacked by Vito.<p>Shane Douglas comes out and says, 30 days are up and his partner is back. He and Buff faced Kronic. The match was goiong in Buff's favor, as he even hit the buff blockbuster. As he was going to go for the pin, Douglas blind tagged in and went for the Pittsburg Plunge on Clark, but Adams stopped him, then they did High Times on both wrestlers and Kronic got the win. Afterwards, Douglas and Buff were pointing fingers and ended up with Douglas attacking Buff.<p>Backstage, Kidman is notified that it will be Hogan/Jarrett tonight and he said there needs to be a special guest ref tonight.<p>Footage was shown from a press confrence held earlier today. In it, Paisley announced that the Artist formerly known as Prince Iuekea will know be known simply as The Artist. Then, from under the table comes Pops of the MIA, he keeps saying he wants pie...(making refrence to poontang pie!)<p>Back in the arena, the MIA come out and challenge the Artist. Paisley says that the Artist will face Lt. Loco for the cruiserwieght title. They wrestle a great cruiserwieght match. Artist gets setup for Major Gunn's croch shot, as she comes in but Paisley stops her and Paisley gets a low blow. Loco goes on the top rope and gets his tornado DDT and gets the win. Pops runs in and tries to give Paisley mouth to mouth but Paisley runs off.<p>Vince Russo and David Flair come out and Russo challenges Ric to a match and if Ric loses, he must retire. Flair comes out and says that he wants a few stipulations. If Russo loses, he retires, Flair gets Russo's job, David comes home, and Russo gets his head shaved. Russo says he wants to make it a handicapped match, and Flair says he will bring Ried and we have a tag match later tonight.<p>Jeff Jarrett defended the World Title against Hulk Hogan with Kidman as the special ref. Throughout the match, the announcers questions Kidman's loyalty, as he was mad at Bischoff for not trusting him about Horace. The announcers were correct as at one point Jarrett was going to hit Hogan with a chair, but Kidman grabbed and it threw it to Hogan who used it. Hogan hit a legdrop and almost got the three count, but Goldberg ran in, speared Kidman, speared Hogan and then jackhammered Hogan through a table. The match never had an official victor. Afterwards, GI Bro came out and Goldberg and Jarrett walked out of the ring.<p>DDP comes out and talks about his past in the business, Bischoff, Kim and Kanyon listen. DDP then says he sick of this business and walks out.<p>Vampiro came out to wrestle the returning Demon. They wrestled all the way to NitroVision. Vamp climbed NitroVision and delivered a double axe handle. The match ends abruptly, and it looks like both men are injured.<p>Kanyon comes out with Kimberly. Kim plugs her new perfume...Positivley Me. Kanyon, plugs his new book, Positivley Kanyon. It is DDP's book, but with Kanyon's name on it. Kanyon then calls anybody out so that he can debut his new move, the Diamond cutter. Scott Stiener accepts the challenge. Stiener dominates and had the Stiener recliner until Mike Awesome comes in and interferes. Awesome and Kanyon double team Stiener, until Kronic come in and chase them out of the arena. Then, out of nowhere, Miss Hancock comes in and attacks Kim and challenges her. Kim says she can't wrestle somebody with glasses so Hancock takes them off and Kim sprays her perfume at her.<p>Ric Flair comes out with Ried to take on Russo/David Flair tonight. Russo gets thrown in and Flair chops him, but Russo isn't affected. He was wearing a chest protector, so Flair took it off. The match went back and forth, but in the end, Russo had Flair down and called Beth in and then he and David attacked Ric and laid on the figure four but Flair wouldn't give up. Finally, his oldest daughter threw in the towel. Flair's career is over. Russo/David cut Ric and Ried's hair.<p>Kevin Nash came out to take on Bill Goldberg. Members of the New Blood were at ringside watching the match. The match went back and forth until Goldberg got control. Nash was slowly coming back, and the New Blood got on the apron, but Nash took them all out. Goldberg grabs a chair and takes down Nash. Goldberg takes his glove off and lays the punches to Nash. Nash's nephew is watching. Poppa Pump runs in but the cops stop him and attack him with night sticks. Nash's nephew comes in to console Nash as Nitro concludes.<p><b>WRESTLINGARENA.CO M - Over 300 images of Nitro (including ChickPix, Goldberg/Nash, Flair's new haircut, Hogan/Jarrett and more) plus after RAW, over 300 images of that.
