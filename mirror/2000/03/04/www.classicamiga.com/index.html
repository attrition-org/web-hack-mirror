Welcome to the new and improved ClassicAmiga.Com<br>
Hacking this site was the easiest job in our lives, <br>
and we want to send huge thanks to the people that <br>
told us about the site. <br>
<br>

<b>Message to the Web"master":<br>

<br>
We did this for all the animals that are being tortured around the world.<br>
Animals that never did anything to the cosmetic industry are being tortured<br>
every day. This is a warning. If you keep torturing the Amiga people in the world <br>
as much as you have done so far... well... <b>C YA AT TG00...</b><br>
<br><br>
No animals were harmed during this operation, exept maybe the biggest of them all<br>
<b>AMICO</b><br><br>
