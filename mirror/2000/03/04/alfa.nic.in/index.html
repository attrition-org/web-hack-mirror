<center><font size=+1>Tens Of Thousands Of Indian Muslims Protest Against
A New Law</font><font size=+1></font>
<p>Thousands of Muslims here on Mar. 3 staged demonstration against a law
introduced
<br>by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government
in India’s
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; largest populated state of Utter Pradesh (UP),
aimed at to prevent construction of
<br>mosques and madrassas.The UP Regulation of Public Religious Buildings
and
<br>Places Bill, passed by the state legislature on January 6, has made
the official
<br>permissionmandatory for the construction of religious places. Around
one lakh
<br>converged at Jamia Masjid and marched towards prime minister’s residence
after on
<br>Mar. 3 prayers.&nbsp; Syed Ahmed Bukhari Naib Imam of Shahi Jama Masjid
in
<br>New Delhi addressed the On Mar. 3 gathering. All roads within a three-kilometer
<br>radius of the mosque were jammed with tens of thousands of Muslims,
shouting
<br>anti-government slogans. “The constitution grants every Indian not
only religious
<br>freedom but also freedom to preach and propagate his religion,” said
Bukhari.
<br>“But this bill attempts to kill this freedom ...We demand its immediate
withdrawal.”
<br>Earlier in the day, prominent Muslim leaders submitted a memorandum
to
<br>President K.R Narayanan, asking him to withhold his assent to the controversial
bill.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The delegation led by former MP and vice-president
of All India Muslim
<br>Majlis-e-Mushawarat Syed Sahabuddin and including former union minister
<br>Saifuddin Soz, former cabinet secretary Zafar Saifullah and scores
of former
<br>senior bureaucrats and politicians said that the law constituted the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most serious interference with freedom of
conscience and of religions enshrined in the constitution. Muslim leaders,
who petitioned President Narayanan apprehended that
<br>the law would strangulate religious institutions. The Utter Pradesh
houses world
<br>famous Islamic seminaries like Darul-Uloom in Deoband, Nadwatul-Ulama
in
<br>Lucknow, Mazahirul Uloom, Saharanpur and Darul-Uloom founded
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp; Maulana Syed Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi
in Bareli city. They said that the hasty
<br>passage of the bill by the UP legislatures on 6 January, without any
discussion and
<br>by voice vote has antagonised the Muslims, who constitute 20 per cent
of the state’s
<br>population and 23 per cent of the total population of the country.
The UP chief minister
<br>Mr. Ram Prakash Gupta has publicly justified the bill by saying, that
it was a measure
<br>to curb the “ISI activities” on the Indo-Nepal border.
