Hello,
<br>Ethics?
<br>ok, sure whynot.
<br>Lynx Compatable, Netscape (l)ie5
<br>in more than one language? meiner nase ist du laut!
<br>Graphics? ohkay
<br>=]
<br>int whining
<br>Where to start with this siteleader.net shizm.
<br>I&nbsp;have been monitoring the situation at siteleader and I have a lot to conclude from what I
have seen.
<br>
<br> A Quick Note to Paying Customers of Siteleader.net, anything you have
stored here, may have been seen by anyone.
<br>1. Insecure Passwords
<br>2. Stupid Users
<br>3. Incompetent Systems Administrator
<br>4. Untrusted Users
<br>5. Poor choice of Operating System for the level of intelligence of
the Administrator
<br>6. The Systems Admin would happen to be blind from birth would he?
<br>7. pcnfsd was the one of the many things that lead to a comprimise
here
<br>8. If you have an account here, then... I think you get the idea.
<br>9. 2 Users have been notified, well atleast they looked legitimate, but
who knows.
<br>10. I&nbsp;have talked with the Admin, he is truely undeserving of
his job.
<br>11. In the words of the incompetent one "Could you please keep this
under wraps, because you know, it wouldn't look too good, I&nbsp;might
loose my job."
<br>12. Uhm, yes you shouldn't have got the job in the first place.
<br>13. Can't you see people cracking passwords on your own systems?
<br>14. Can't you see eggdrop bots being run on your own systems?
<br>15. Can't you see nmap binaries flurried all over the system?
<br>16. Can't you see exploits (their binaries and sources) flurried all
over your own systems?
<br>17. Couldn't you see the copy of the master passwd file in /etc chowned
to a non root user?
<br>18. Havn't you seen the numerous kids running amok on your own systems?
<br>19. Root has been aquired by a script kiddie.
<br>20. This Script kiddie leaves his 0day readable to anyone.
<br>21. He goes by the nick "mastermnd".
<br>22. ns2.siteleader.net has been comprimised also.
<br>23. ns1 and ns4 seem to have been immune to script kiddies because the
only remote access to them is ssh.
<br>24. Every users home directory is world readable.
<br>25. /tmp is no longer writable to, therefor vi cannot function with
its defualt setting.
<br>26. If anyone took the time to check up on whats happening on the system
they'd find that around 40% of the users on ns2 have tried to comprimise
the system.
<br>27. Emailing root@thisbox or amoreno@thisbox or hamlin@thisbox would
be pointless, because the comprimisee intercepts all email.
<br>28. Division-X sucks.
<br>29. It seems, that the Sys Admin was relying on me to tell him&nbsp;
"how" to patch his system, command by command, to that I say "were you
born yesterday?".
<br>30. He has not the intellect to determine age over the internet, or
my social engineering skills seem to be too much for him.
<br>31. If I were you, Mr Hamlin/Amoreno/System Admin, its time for you
to quit your job or start to bring yourself to the current day, learn unix,
and a number of other things.
<br>32. I can see that the Systems Administrator has tried to half-assedly
manage siteleader.net
<br>33. Looking at this situation sickens me.
<br>34. I'm sure there are many people that could easily resolve this
situation.
<br>35. *shrug*, assholes.
<br>36. I'd be pretty ashamed to have aol script kiddies on your box too.
<br>37. a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a000a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0
<br>38. eh?
<br>39. Easy as Drinking cheese.
<br>39. Piece of Cake.
<br>40. No Cake for you.
<br>41. Close but no pie.
<br>42. There's more meatloaf in a meatloaf than there is in Romania.
<br>43. I've seen more passes in a Disco.
<br>44. ack.
<br>45. #include "disclaimer"
<br>46. *yawn*
<br>47. "Call John. Call John now! I know this hurts, call john now!".
<br>48. You took the guts right out of my mouth.
<br>49. 23.
<br>50. *ahem* Nothing is safe. *ahem*.
