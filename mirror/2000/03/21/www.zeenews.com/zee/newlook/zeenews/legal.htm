    <p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">ZEE does not collect
    personally identifiable information about individuals except when such individuals
    specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis. For example, such personally
    identifiable information may be gathered from a contest or sweepstakes registration, the
    registration process for subscription sites or services and in connection with content
    submissions, community postings (e.g., chat and bulletin boards), suggestions,
    voting/polling activities and transactional areas. Personally identifiable information on
    individual users will not be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties
    without the approval of the user at the time of collection. At such points of collection,
    the user will have the opportunity to indicate whether he or she would like to &quot;opt
    out&quot; of receiving promotional and/or marketing information about other products,
    services and offerings from ZEE and/or any third parties. Further, notwithstanding any opt
    out of promotional information by the user, ZEE reserves the right to contact a subscriber
    regarding account status, changes to the subscriber agreement and other matters relevant
    to the underlying service and/or the information collected. </font></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">ZEE reserves the right to
    perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure
    interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such
    information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to or clicked on their
    advertising banners. ZEE will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third
    parties. Also, users should be aware that ZEE may sometimes permit third parties to offer
    subscription and/or registration-based services through a ZEE site.</font></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">ZEE is not responsible for
    any actions or policies of such third parties and users should check the applicable
    privacy policy of such party when providing personally identifiable information. </font></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Additionally, users should be
    aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user
    name, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas of the ZEE sites, that
    information, along with any substantive information disclosed in the user's communication,
    can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited
    messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of
    ZEE. Users also should be aware that non-personal information and data may be
    automatically collected through the standard operation of ZEE's internet servers or
    through the use of &quot;cookies.&quot; &quot;Cookies&quot; are small text files a website
    can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the
    site and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow
    content improvements and targeted advertising. Cookies are not programs that come onto a
    user's system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to
    the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. Users should be aware that ZEE
    cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third
    parties hosting data for ZEE. If a user does not want information collected through the
    use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny
    or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to
    provide the user with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information)
    available on the ZEE Site. </font></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Upon request, ZEE will allow
    any user to &quot;opt out&quot; of further promotional contacts at any time. Additionally
    upon request, ZEE will use reasonable efforts to allow users to update/correct personal
    information previously submitted which the user states is erroneous to the extent such
    activities will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon a user's request,</font></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">ZEE will use commercially
    reasonable efforts to functionally delete the user and his or her personal information
    from its database; however, it may be impossible to delete a user's entry without some
    residual information&nbsp; because of backups and records of deletions. </font></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The foregoing policies are
    effective as of todate. ZEE reserves the right to change this policy at any time by
