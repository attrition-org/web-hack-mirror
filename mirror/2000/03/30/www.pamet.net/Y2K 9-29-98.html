<dir>
  </b></font><font FACE="Arial"><p>Based on our understanding of the requirements for Year
  2000 compliance and extensive testing of our software applications, Pamet Systems&#146;
  software products will support the Year 2000 transition. </p>
  <p>Our software applications are relatively new and as such have been designed and
  enhanced with the Year 2000 transition in mind. As additional modifications are
  implemented, Year 2000 compliance will continue to be part of the testing procedure prior
  to release. </p>
  <p>We continue to monitor the progress of other vendors on whom we depend, such as
  Microsoft and Compaq (Digital), and although we cannot certify their products we believe
  that their products are compliant. However, compliance may not apply to older computer
  equipment or non-current versions of system software that is procured from other vendors
  either through Pamet or your agency. </p>
  <p>Many data fields in our public safety applications require the ability to accept and
  calculate results based on a four-digit year. Being able to enter licenses, permits or
  warrants that may expire after 12/31/1999 has been a system&#146;s input requirement
  during the 1990's. This capability has been in-place since our program was first written
  in 1986.</p>
