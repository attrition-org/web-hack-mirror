            hack.be has made a press release public today, stating that .be is a joke.
            they proved this by breaking into the network of dastronic, a completely
            unknown belgian webhosting company.
            the country's prime minister tells the people not to worry though.
            they have hired supersecurityman ReDaTtAcK to come and secure every
            since nt box in belgium. ha. ha. ha.
            <br><br>
            completely unrelated to this story, a belgian all-interest group
            called eb.kcah recently bought shares in dastronic.be.
