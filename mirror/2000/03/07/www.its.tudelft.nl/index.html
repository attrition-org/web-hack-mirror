What a silly thing that the Faculty of Computation should get hacked/defaced/0wned by a bunch computer anarchists.<br>
It is such a remarkable thing that institutions like Universities that are supposed to teach one a subject as computation seem to have no form of security overall.<br>
Perhaps an attack like this shall rouse you all from your pathetic arrogance and shows you the real implications of your stupid security.<br><br>

To all who does care we have included the directpry structure of this server and a dump of all the Windows boxes shared on this network to make sure that people like the administrator of this b0x will not be able to state: Oh, they just defaced the main page - it's not that they 0wned all our data, walked around as IUSR_SYSTEM and so on...<br><br>
