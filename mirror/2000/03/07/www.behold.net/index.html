Heay another site owned by Ph33r the b33r.

We have noticed that this is a religous site. 

Well sorry but.


<font size=5>We Have Sinned.</font>

We belive in freedom of religon but wtf.

Do you really think jesus was a god?
No.

He was a great man nothing more, and yes he does deserve alot of respect 
but....


This is the year 2000. You figure people would have learned by now not to 
worship false idols.

Heaven i am sure in theory is a great place.
If it was real. 

The real god is your own mind. You have more control over yourself than 
any god.

Most people worship god out of fear they will go to hell.

To many false believers in the world today.



The idea of the bible itself is genuis. A book that no one profits from 
as far as one person. A book that has been around foreever. So therefore 
it must be real right?
Wrong. its just a bunch of stories proving a point. If you believe they 
are real then well wake up.

It teaches morals which is great. It keeps people from dooing bad things 
out of fear. Which is good. . Also it teaches love evyerone.

Wtf.

and also turn the other check. Why?

If some1 rapes my child i will nto love them and ignore it. hell no.

I will fuck them up. I will not murder them though. That is morally wrong.

The actual concept of life is unknown. There is no great plan.

So enjoy life and please stop hoping that TALL TAILS are going to save you.

Thats all the bible is is a bunch of TALL tails. Like pual bunion and his ox.





Well admin we are sorry we had to hit you. You have done nothing wrong. I 
respect your beliefs i honestly do.
