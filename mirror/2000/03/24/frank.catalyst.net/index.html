FIRST YOU CALL US "IMMATURE IDIOTS". THEN YOU CONTINUE TO
REINVENT YOURSELF BY THE DAY, MAKING OUTLANDISH CLAIMS TO
BOLSTER YOUR REPUTATION AS A PRETENTIOUS AND CLUELESS DIPSHIT.
YOU UNDERESTIMATED US. THAT WAS YOUR BIGGEST MISTAKE. WHO'S
LAUGHING NOW?

<p>

YOU HAVE NO IDEA OF HOW TO SECURE A SYSTEM. WHAT MADE US REACH
THIS CONCLUSION? THE FACT THAT YOUR WHOLE NETWORK HAS BEEN SUBVERTED,
PENETRATED AND OWNED IN UNDER A WEEK. YOU HAVE NO IDEA OF HOW TO
WRITE A SECURE WEBSERVER, AND YET YOU ANTAGONIZE THE EFFORTS OF THE
APACHE DEVELOPMENT TEAM. YOUR BOXES COLLECTIVELY HAVE MORE VULNERABILITIES
THAN WE CAN COUNT. WELL SORRY MR SECURITY EXPERT, BUT YOU HAVE BEEN OWNED.
YOU CAN SIT IN YAHOO WITH YOUR KEYBOARD DIARRHEA AND CONTRIVED "TECHNICAL
SKILLS" FOR 16 HOURS A DAY, BUT WE'VE JUST SMACKED YOU IN THE FACE.

<p>

THIS BOX WAS OWNED REMOTELY THROUGH AN UNCHECKED BOUNDS VULNERABILITY
IN A CUSTOM WEBSERVER RUNNING WITH ROOT PRIVILEGES. SOMEONE SHOULD
INFORM MRYOWLER OF SPRINTF()'S SNPRINTF() REPLACEMENT FUNCTION WHICH,
ALTHOUGH NOT CONFORMING TO THE ORIGINAL ANSI C STANDARD, IS PRESENT
IN THE NEW C99 STANDARD. THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE OWNED HIS DUMB ASS.
