        <td rowspan="3" width="310"><b>Jane Petro's practice
        covers a remarkable range: from her pioneering work in
        reconstructive microsurgery and neonatal cleft palate, to
        her commitment to providing the best available care for
        burn patients, to her increasing involvement in the
        rapidly developing world of cosmetic surgery.<br>
        <br>
        Since 1981 she has served as an Associate Professor of
        Surgery at New York Medical College. She is Associate
        Director of the Burn Center at the Westchester County
        Medical Center and a founding partner of the New York
        Group for Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.<br>
        <br>
        She is a graduate of the Pennsylvania State College of
        Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania. She trained in general
        surgery at the University of Louisville, Kentucky, and at
        Harrisburg Hospital in Pennsylvania. She completed her
        plastic surgery residency at Hershey Medical Center
        before going on to fellowships in both burn care and
        microsurgery at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in
        New York. Dr. Petro is certified by the American Boards
        of Surgery and of Plastic Surgery.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Petro has been able to combine her profession with
        her love of travel. She has taught breast reconstruction
        in Belgium, taught and performed reconstructive surgery
        at clinics in rural Brazil, worked with the Sisters of
        Charity in Zambia, and, more unusually, assisted at an
        emergency appendectomy in the Antarctic. She is an
        experienced sailor and equestrian and is active in the
        fight against domestic violence. </b><p><a href="cv.html"><b><u>Click
