<p align="center">Hello again folks,&nbsp; Nytek here.&nbsp; As I addressed in
the last defacement, It's me, the former Opiat3.&nbsp; If you need me, you know
how to contact me, just now with a different name.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center">-</p>
<p align="center">I was sitting back, and I was thinking.&nbsp; Why do we
love?&nbsp; Is love physical?&nbsp; Is it more than a physical attraction at
all?&nbsp;
Is love more than a chemical reaction that causes increases in certain brain
chemicals?&nbsp; I don't know, personally.&nbsp; But I was wondering.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a look at couples today.&nbsp; Some huge number of them
are getting divorced.&nbsp; Is the magic dead?&nbsp; Is there magic even?&nbsp; It
seems like people are growing more and more greedy each and every day that
passes.&nbsp; I know personally that it's hard for me to even look at someone
who's not physically attractive to me as an example of this issue.&nbsp; Maybe I'm superficial, maybe the
world is superficial too.&nbsp; If we're products of our environments what
shapes those environments that shape us?&nbsp;And where the hell was this pop
culture spawned from?&nbsp; I'm not even that old myself, but I remember days before
it.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center">The letter doesn't stop there.&nbsp;There's also the issue of
beauty I mentioned.&nbsp; Don't expect to look all
beautiful and as a result be happy because of it.&nbsp; Your outside is your shell.&nbsp; If
you've got no inner-love, you're JUST A SHELL.&nbsp; If said girl is blindingly
attractive, but is a total vain and heartless bitch (those of you out there know
who you are), then she's just as ugly as a dead mule on the train tracks.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To summarize,&nbsp; do whatever you need to
do, but only do it if you feel right about it.&nbsp; I hope some people can
relate to this short rant of mine and think about it in relation to their own
lives,&nbsp; because that really would make a difference.&nbsp; Think before you
do something that will effect you or others for life.&nbsp; Think before you
decide, think before you pull the trigger, think before you die.&nbsp;&nbsp; -Nytek&nbsp;
