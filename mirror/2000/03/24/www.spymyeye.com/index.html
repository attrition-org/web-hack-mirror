a werd from the klown:
	
	in march 1998, there was about 1/4
as many defacers as there are today. this is just proving
that cyber-crime is finally catching on. but hey, i don't
influence anyone to deface a page, or d/l 200k cc#s.txt files.
ppl ask me why i do this..and i'm no HaX0r WhAx0r, i'm just
a normal perverted psychopathic clown who is trying to educate,
and voice myself at the same time. lub to all the activists,
anarchists and all the ppl that take shit in this werld and
are still waiting to avenge. ;0)
