<p><font face="Technical">Intro: Picking a handle By: DRiVE </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">As every haxor knows 31337 talking is the most
important part of
being a haxor. So learn how to do it. LEARN IT!!! LOVE IT!!!! LIVE
IT!!!! </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Picking a leet0 hax0r handle is also very
important. Do it
carefully or people might not Ph33r j00! </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Picking a handle By: DRiVE </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">In the famous words of joey &quot; i need a
handle &quot;. This
is true. Every great hax0r has a 31337 handle. I am going to help you pick
the best one. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">STEP ONE: </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">find a handle that at least 70 other people have
such as acid ,
demon , rave ,and thug. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">STEP TWO: </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">if you cant find one that alot of people have
just make sure
yours has alot of x's in it. That way people will really ph33r you . I
mean everyone knows
that people</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">with x's in their handles are the best at
hax0ring gibsons, this
is because when you log into a gibson it messes it up because UNIX for
Win95 wasnt made to</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">recognize x's. So dont have something that makes
sense , instead
of something like DOC try Xdocx or xDxOxCx. This will let people know you
are 31137. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">STEP THREE: </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Make it scary. Not something simple that
describes you or
anything about you but something nasty like hellgod or deathbringer , you
know just so
people will</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">think you are K00L. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">STEP FOUR: </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Join a warez group or if you want to be really
31337 start your
own i suggest the name W.M.A this stands for WaReZ MoBsTaS of AmErIcA
....this way
everyone</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">will know you listen to tupac and you are really
in a gang and
that if &quot; Da TaLk SuM mO sHizNiT YoU Is gOnNa CoMe To Da
HoUsE&quot; then always ask
for their</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">address this will make them think you are going
to come and
shoot them. Anyways after you start you group make a rad ass tag to put on
all your warez.
Then</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">send it out and this way people will know you
are elite. I
recomend sending a mass mail to tosemail1 , this waaay tosemail1 will tell
all the guides
not to fuck with</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">you because you have a kick ass
punter. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">STEP FIVE: </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">after you have a cool ass handle go into all the
2600 newsgroups
and post alot of messages asking for loops and how to jackpot atms this
way people will
know</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">what you are talking about. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">STEP SIX: </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">now you have all the respect you could ever want
just go into
phreak and tell them you and your boyz can sk00L them. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Section 1: Getting Online By: 0rin </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">To get online from your house, you must first
own a computer.
You can find these at Garage Sales, Electronics Catalogs, or your friendly
Radio Shack.
Make sure</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">to make it clear to the person you are
purchasing the computer
from that you are using it for hacking intentions. Once you have acquired
a computer,
check and</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">see if it has a modem. A modem could be a small
box with lights
on it, and an outlet for a telefone jack, or a large telefone reciever on
the back of your</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">computer...Be careful, this fone may _only_ be
used for calling
other computers, and never for personal calls! Usually these fones are
monitored by the
police, so</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">it would probably be your best bet to get an
external modem, as
there is no way the cops could listen in on an extension. Once you know
you have a modem,</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">you're close on your way to becoming a real
hacker. The next
thing you should do is get an account on America Online immediately; this
is the hacker's</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">playground, and you will meet many intelligent
people there. To
do this, it takes a little thinking. You should first get some AOL
software. This is
accomplished by</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">going up to your friendly mailman and asking him
for a
complimentary AOL installation disk. The government gives mailmen these
disks to pass out
free to the</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">public. Usually, the mailman will give you a
short tutorial on
the installation process (its widely known in the computer community that
mailmen make the
best</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">hackers). After you have created your AOL
account, it is
important to think of a good Screen Name (see appendix for some
suggestions). Now, you are
almost</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">there! </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Section 2: Looking Cool By: Orin </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">The most important thing about hacking is
looking cool. If you
look cool, people like you, and if people like you, you can fool them into
letting you
hax0r them. If</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">they don't think you look cool, they're probably
lamers anyway.
Looking cool is accomplished by having a bad-ass attitude, and unique
personal qualities
like</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">being a raver or a druggie. For instance, most
people will think
you are cool if you tell them you are female. They'll also think you're
cool if you can
make them</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">ph33r you. But, the art of ph33r will come in
later chapters, as
it is an advanced hacking skill. Right now, just follow this simple rule
of thumb for
looking cool:</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Never talk about computers, and always throw in
capital letters
and numbers while typing. Oh and not to mention, in order to be a l33t0
hax0r j00 must be</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">arrested at least several times, since being
arrested can
sometimes prove to be difficult. Try these methods. I. Pranking the FBI
</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">ahh yes a personal favorite of mine, pranking
the FBI always a
fun past </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">time especially since they can't trace it or
nothing. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">II. Hax0ring your way into ATM's </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Take a mini computer ( a name I do not know
) and attach it to
the ATM </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">(a method I do not know). You get this mini
computer through the
blackmarket. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Then the way everything works is I don't know,
but I sure got
caught and I </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">sure stole $ 4,000 and AND the authorities sure
THREATENED me
with computer </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">probation *gasp*. I did it so long ago I don't
remember the
rest. If you </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">don't believe me just ask DCY he knows
everything because after
all he is a </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">13 year old 7'2&quot; hacker!!! </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">III. Calling the police </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Now call the police and tell them you know about
a drug dealing
mafia super </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">villian type that lives next door, then give
them your address
but make </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">absoluely certain you have enough proof of your
evil schemes,
such as a to do </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">list like so </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">1. Do dishes </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">2. Clean living room </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">3. Pick up groceries </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">4. Take over the world </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">5. Baby sit the neighbors kid </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">6. Torture neighbors kid </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">7. Kill neighbors kid </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">8. Hide neighbors kids body </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">etc... </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">etc... </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Also make sure to have plenty of your mind
expanding drugs and
such lying </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">around so if all else fails they'll make sure to
arrest you over
these. On </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">the off chance they refuse to, scream things
like &quot;Hack the
Planet&quot; and </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">&quot;Roswell! Where its at !!&quot; Don't worry
about making
any sense, real hax0rs </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">don't make sence and babble incoherently for
hours on end
(similar to the </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Unabomber's manifesto). </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Now that you have acheived l33tness by being
arrested, you can
brag about </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">how you got arested and how the CIA, FBI, and
PLO are after you
(its common </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">knowledge that the palastinian liberation
organization have a
great interest </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">in bringing computer hax0rs to justice so they
can cut your
hands off thus </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">denying you the ability to type well with your
fingers at least
which is why </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">we included a guide to typing with your toes on
the off chance
you have </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">already been captured by the PLO). </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Never ever forget to take pride in hax0ring the
FBI and CIA with
Fate X </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">9123213; this is very l33t and you should never
hesitate to brag
about your </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">acomplishments. If somene says they do not
believe you, hax0r
there ass by </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">punting them (covered more theroughly later
on). </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Other ways to look |&lt; |2 /\ [) include
scrolling, mass
mailings, </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">punting, and lets not forget the power of ph33r,
if you threaten
to turn off </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">everyones fone, cable, power, etc, they will
ph33r you. When you
say this, </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">everyone will always take you seriously and will
go out on there
porch and </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">sit in the rocking chair cradling there shotguns
and drinking
Jack Daniels </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">waiting for you. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Also, all hax0rs are racist, sexist, apocolyptic
bastards, so
support your </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">local redneck crackhead klan or whatever you
call the kkk. Never
ever forget </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">to refer to women as pussy and remember you can
buy love (ie
prostitution; </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">because sex and love are exactly the same
thing. Now, I may
sound like I am </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">being sarcastic but I assure you I am not, if
you have any
doubts in my </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">l33tness ask CDJ he is very smart. (that left a
bad taste in my
mouth) </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">The last way to look cool (and these are the
only ways) is to
claim your </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">down with Kevin Mitnick, the mentor, or are a
part of LOD. This
contributes to </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">how much people will ph33r you, but if they ask
you any
questions about them, </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">either ignore them or be exceptionally vague
becuase otherwise
they won't </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">take you serious, becuase real hax0rs never have
facts they just
say stuff </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">like &quot;Me and Kevin Mitnick are best
friends, we hax0r
Gibsons together&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">This will impress everyone and give you instant
coolness,
l33tness, and most </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">importantly, make you look cool. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Section 3: The art of ph33r by: Curt </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Making People ph33r you doesn't come
naturally. There is
actually an art to it. To make people ph33r you, you MUST have a leeto
burrito screen name
first of all.</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">(see appendix for some suggestions). Second you
MUST ask
question like &quot;R there any good hax0rs here?!? Gimme a good Nua
dial-up for Unix if u
dare&quot;. Now</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">that one is a MUST. Third, you will have to talk
shit about
people that call you a warez pup; when they do it, say something like
&quot;j0e
m0mma!&quot; then they will ph33r</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">you also. Another helpful way to make people
ph33r is getting
out Fate X 99 1/2 and hax0ring away at AOL and hax0r chat rooms. Call
people lame too....
See</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">that wasn't hard at all, and people all ph33r
you now. And NEVER
EVER think you own sp0ck; ph33r sp0ck cause he owns YOU. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Section 4: The art of
&quot;fucking&quot; by: Cirrus </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">First, you must learn what you are trying to
accomplish. If you
have intentions to steal, break, or destroy, read no further. You can
easily take over
someones</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">computer, (Well, ok, this is destructive) by
obtaining thier IP
address. Say, they are setting up an FTP server, or, just get them to tell
you what it is.
Now, you must</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">get some kind of a program, and Ping them, to
find out if the
are lagging or not. Now, ( if they have an FTP ) you can kill there FTP by
using a port
fucker. Put it to</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">&quot;fuck&quot; port 21 . If they don't have
one, obtain a
program called &quot;WinNewk&quot;. That will just shut down thier
computer to say the
least, but, I will not get into how it</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">works this time. You can also use a pinger, and
ping the hell
out of them, which can sometimes have the effect of a Nuke. Next time I
will teach you how
to clone a</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">cellular fone with a pixy stick. Have fun!.. oh
yeah, if I find
out you were doing this shit to hurt something other than a
Computer/Server/Host, like a
teacher, or an</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">old friend with a new PC, I will fucking beat
your ass. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Section 5: Advanced AOL Hacking Techniques
by: IMP </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">After you have mastered basic |-|4&gt;&lt;0|2ing
skillz, you can
move on to advanced methods. The first thing ya gots ta do to be a master
|-|4&gt;&lt;0|2
d00d is to go</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">into a W4R3Z room and spend a minimum of
4238923487 hours a week
in there until you have every version of Fate available, plus 9 or more
gigs of pirated</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">software. Now go into private room
&quot;Phreak&quot; and offer
to trade your W4R3Z for other W4R3Z. It's very 1337 to assume that people
will ignore you
when you only</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">say it once, so a true |-|4&gt;&lt;0|2 will
scroll it about 13
times, and as you should know by now, all in caps or LeeT0 WaReZ FoNT. If
3 seconds go by
and no one's</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">responded in a positive manner yet, scroll it
again, only this
time try 2 dozen times to make sure you get your point across. And a true
|-|4&gt;&lt;0|2
always uses mucho</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">punctuation. (ie: ANYONE WANNA TRADE QUACKE FOR
DUCK
NUKKEM?!??!?!?!?!!?!!) Now, often times if one of the lamerz who hang out
in that room and</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">ruin its general 1337ness happen to be there,
they'll try to say
some bullshit like &quot;This isn't a warez room.&quot; Well, don't listen
to them, use
one of your many /&lt;-Rad</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">punters and show them who's 1337. Make sure you
advertise the
punter 10 or 20 times before actually trying to punt them, this way you'll
make them
scared and</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">they'll probably apologize and stuff, which will
make everyone
else ph33r you. (See section 3) Occassionally when you try to punt them,
you get an error
message</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">that says their ims are off. No one is sure why
this happens,
it's probably something wrong with aol. Maybe they'll fix it in the next
version, or maybe
they're too</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">lame to have ims!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

maybe they're too
lame to</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">have ims!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ROFLMFOAJFHJLO OK,
but seriously,
if your first punter doesn't w3rk, try 7 or 8 of your other punters. If it
still doesn't
work, just make fun of</font></p>

fone hax0ring,
and the first </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">thing you must learn to be a l33t0 phreaker is
to substitute all
f's with </font></p>

you are just </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">another lamer (like joey unless you do a
righteous hack
remember), also to be </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Blue Box- a box, blue spray paint </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Beige Box- a box, Beige spray paint </font></p>

will take a </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Section 7: Hacking with Fate
by: Missy</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Now this is the leetest stage there is. because
Fate it the
leetsest prog there is, a true foundation to the hacker community. There
are many versions
of Fate, but its</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">always good to have all the versions. (Little do
people know,
when you compile all the different source codes of Fate you have the
security information
to hack a</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Gibson, very very 31337.) To get Fate go into a
hacker private
room, something like MM or even Fate (yes thats right, Fate even has its
own room!) and
start</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">scrolling your request. People will be obliged
to help such a
worthy cause. Now that you have obtained Fate you have to get a dial up,
something like
the FBI. You</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">can find these number listed in your local phone
book. After you
call them you may get what sounds like someone talking through your modem
speaker. This is
one of</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">their secret tatics to make you think that you
got a wrong fone
number. Once this has happened you have made contact, remember this is an
important part,
so keep</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">calling back. Now the connection has been made
start pushing all
the buttons on the Fate screen. This may look like its not doing anything,
but thats only
the</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">hidden screen so that nobody can see what you
really doing.
Which means its great to use this in school, or other open places. Now
that the steps have
been</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">completed get back on Amercia Online and tell
everyone of your
accomplishment. This will let them know how leet you are, and show them
you are one to
ph33r. (This</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">will help you get all the chix0rs, see later
sections.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Section 8: HaX0ring your local Gibson by: Mike
</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Any real haX0r will tell you that a Gibson is a
huge
supercomputer with amazing security. How do they know? How else? They
watched
&quot;Hackers&quot; and learned it all.</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Now, the trick is to find one of these. All you
have to do is
call your friendly FBI office and ask them for a Gibson dialup. Make sure
your intentions
are clear, or</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">they'll lie to you. Next, go to Phreak and bug
everyone asking
if anyone can card you a laptop. When DCY is done ripping you off, take
your laptop and
magically</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">hook it up to a payphone. I won't get into how
to do this,
because its too 31337 for a beginner. Now, all you have to do is use a
phone dialing
program and call</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">the dialup. Once you've connected, Run in a
cirle, stomp on the
ground, strip naked and jump on top of the phone booth screaming to old
women near you,
&quot;I AM</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">DADE MURPHY!!! PH33R ME!!!&quot; then get down,
and turn your
brand new laptop on and off about 400 times really fast. This should give
you a mail port.
If it</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">doesn't, the Gibson doesn't properly ph33r you
and you should
get another number, but this time try calling the CIA. They're usually
alot more friendly.
Once</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">you've successfully gained access, be sure to
post all of your
achecivements on your local Warez/HaX0r/p0lice BBS. </font></p>

from PR: leet</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">NOTE: If your worried about being caught, Please
refer to the
end of this article.</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Alright, get all your little asses around
here. Way back before
you were making model airplanes, jerking off, and hax0ring, there where
the Warriors of
the Almighty</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Paperclip. Armed with only with a paperclip and
the occasionaly
back hoe, these brave adolscents would use the combined power of these
menial tools and
their</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">intelligence to operate payfones in amazing
ways. One of the
most legendary and perhaps the best of the Warriors of the Almighty
Paperclip was the
vernerable</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">and supreme uberpaperclipman, Timmy. When Timmy
was 10, he was
playing on his fathers construction site. Timmy, being the child prodigy
that he was,
figured</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">out something amazing: if he took a paperclip,
any old
paperclip, and put it on the RT terminals (if the preceeding terms don't
make sense, try
doing what Timmy</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">does in the coming sentances of wonder) he would
not only be
shocked and possibly burned, but that fone would NOT WORK WHILE THE
PAPERCLIP WAS IN</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">PLACE!! Timmy, because he was dropped on his
head from a height
of 10 feet at the age of 2, had a problem of not remembering. Foretunately
for the phreak</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">community at large, a 2x4 came shooting out of
no wear and hit
Timmy in his now mishapened head. That wonderous peice of flying wood
cemented the
paperclip</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">into Timmy's memory*. So Timmy, who made a
transformation
comparable to that of Job's in The Lawnmower Man with a peice of wood,
took his wheelchair
to</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">payfones, and using one of those illustrious
paperclips, managed
to...</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">WAIT! I hear you bitching!</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">You stupid old schooler! What the HELL does this
have to do with
me?!</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Is THAT what your saying?</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Well, not much, but it was a nice
story.</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Actually, if your scrawny asses have ever seen
Wargames, you
would know that kid with the bad haircut managed to get a free call with a
paperclip.
Alas, today, it is</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">not as easy as it once was. See, back in
Wargame's time, which,
incedentally, for those who'd like to know when it was made, 15 years or
so before the
movie</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Hackers**, paynfones used to be easy to
phreak. But NO MORE! </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">In the last phreaking article, you may of heard
about the red
box, the blue box, and the beige box. If not, well then drink some more
cuervo, sit back,
and enjoy the</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">ride. For simplicity's sake, we'll start with a
very useful box,
the cardboard box. This is a relatively easy to make box, but you would be
forgiven if the
box wasn't</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">completed in under a day. To make a cardboard
box, you'll need:
a big cardboard box, a red box, a car, and some hard liquor. The only two
ingredients
essential are</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">the cardboard box and the hard
liquor. Prefferably scotch.
Speaking of hard liquor, in my next article, I'll be talking about old
fashioned RPGs.
Back to the subject</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">at hand. If you have your cardboard box and your
scotch, it's
time you find a payfone. Once the payfone is reached, drink a quarter of
the bottle of
scotch. And</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">not in those little girly swigs, I'm talking
BAM! Then, after
you get back up, take the receiver of the payfone and shove it through the
top of the big
cardboard box.</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Dial a random 800 number, for example. Then
proceed to get
underneath the box, and practice fone copulation with the operator you
reach. At every
minute, or</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">when it feels best, continue to take large doses
of the scotch.
Remember: after this excursion, YOU MUST GO IN AOL AND SCROLL THIS
ACCOMPLISHMENT!</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Otherwise, you really didn't phreak. And
besides, the chix0rs

<p><font face="Technical">Section 10: Chix0rs, and How to get them. By
0rin</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Chix0rs are one of the great rewards of being a
truly 1337
hacker. The true hacker has all the chix0rs he desires as his
fingertips. A chix0r is a
female hacker. Of</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">course, girls *can't* be hackers, but, its nice
to have a few
who pretend; it adds diversity to the hax0r community. A good way find out
if there are
any chix0rs</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">around is to go into private rooms and ask
around (i.e. &quot;R
THERE N E FEMALES IN DA ROOM?!?!!?!?!!@#!?&quot;). I've heard there are
lots of girls in a
private room</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">called Phreak, but, thats just a lame \\'aReZ
room. So, after
you have determined that there are indeed chix0rs inhabiting your room,
its probably a
good idea to win</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">them over with your obviously 1337 charm. You do
this by showing
them who's boss. For example:</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Xir0KewL: R THERE NE CHIX IN DA
ROOM?!?!!@#!?!?!??!</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Chix0r43: Argh, there they go again
:-/</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Xir0KewL: CHIX0R, R U FEMALE?!?!</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Chix0r43: I am genderless.</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Xir0KewL: PHUCK OFF BITCH</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">. Chix0r43: eh?</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Xir0KewL: DUMB PUSSY LICKING BITCH. U QUEEF
TAMPONS OUT YR
ASS!!@!!!!</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Chix0r43: hehe, i bet he feels
inadequate</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Xir0KewL: SHUT UP, BITCH, YOU DONT MAKE NO
SINCE</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">As you can seel, Chix0r43 obvously wants
Xir0KewL, and its just
a matter of him punting her a few times to get her to see this. A large
part of obtaining
chix0rs is</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">being ph33red (see Section 3). If you are
ph33red by the
chix0rs, it puts you one step closer to total hax0r domination (see
Appendix).</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Section 11: BBS hax0ring for
dummies. By: Cochise</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">The first step to hacking a BBS (Bulletin Board
System) is to
find the phone number for one. The best way to do this is to go to the
best hacking
resource there</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">is, AOL. Go into all of the chat rooms,
ecspecially the warez
rooms, and scroll many times asking for a BBS number in your area
code. IMPORTANT: you
must scroll</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">many times or you will not get a number. After
you scroll it
about 100 times people will think you are so elite that they will give you
a BBS number.
Another way to</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">get a number is to subscribe to all of the hax0r
mailing lists
and newsgroups you can find and post many messages a day asking for a BBS
number in your
area</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">code. You can also tell them your phone number,
that helps out
alot. And once you have the number the hard part is over.</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">The next thing you have to do is dial the number
with your
communication software. HyperTerrible&#153; is the best, but it only comes
with Microsoft
Unix 97, so use</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">whatever you have. Once you connect login with a
name like John
Q. Phreak just so everyone knows that they should ph33r you (See Section
3). Once you get
on</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">download everything you can find, even if you
dont know what it
is. But dont be a leech, make sure your upload/download ratio is at least
300:1. Send
messages</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">to the sysop and tell him how &quot;/&lt;-
r4D&quot; he is and
ask if you can upload your 31337 warez to the board (and do it anyways
even if he says
no). Become friends</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">with him and find out a time when no one will be
at his house.
Then look up his address in the phone book (because being the l33t hax0r
you are you
already know</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">his real name). Now this is where the real
hacking begins.</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Before you go hax0ring around you must have the
proper tools:</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">1) Hard liquor (See Section 9)</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">2) An axe (more on this later)</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">3) Your laptop (of course you have a laptop
youre 31337)</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">The next step is to go to his house (you may use
tool number one
at any time). Then you must find an exploit that will let you into his
house (break in).
If you can</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">not find one, brute force hacking (with the axe
) is always
good. Then make your way to the where the computer is. This is your moment
of zen, you are
now about</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">to hax0r a BBS. The next thing you do is get the
axe and hold it
as far back as you can, then bring it down as hard as you can hacking the
CPU, monitor,</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">keyboard, mouse and any other computer parts you
see. The last
step in becoming a BBS Uberhax0r is to plug your laptop into the modem and
immediatly sign
on</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">to AOL and start bragging about your
accomplishment and letting
everyone marvel in your glory so they know how lame they really
are.</font></p>

of that lame
shit. what this is all</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">about is what REAL hackers do: get
inf0z.</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">PART_1: GeTtInG aCcEsS tO YoUr
LiBrArY</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Ok, hackers want information. they love
information. info turns
them on. Now, s'pose you suck. this shouldn't be hard. now let's s'pose
you want to learn
unix...you</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">heard eggheads talk about it in chatrooms and it
sounds elite.
But wait! Silicon Toad doesn't have any good filez on it. you wanna know
why? he sucks
ass. but</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">that's besides the point. A source of good info
on unix would be
your public library! i know, i know...they took away your library card for
never returning</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">_coping_with_being_a_loser_. But i figured out a
way to help you
get your info. just walk in, ask the librarian for books on unix (using
the card cataloge
is far too</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">advanced for you right now) and then sit down
and read it.
Problems? Here's a list of what may have went wrong (btw- don't do these
in the future):</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">-you went when they are closed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">-you went naked, cops arrested you, then anally
raped your arse.</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">-all the metal shit on yer pierced face set off
the stolen book
detectors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">It's that easy. Now get some
Kn0wLeDgE.</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">PART_2: GeTtInG iNf0z On PeOpLe</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">For some reason, knowing someone's name,
address, telephone
number, etc etc is real elite. Just ask s010 from CRH. In all his zines he
gets inf0z on
those sinnerz</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">dorks. god damnit, this is so dumb i won't even
write it. just
use a f00kin telephone book. wow, i 0wN j00. i got your telephone
numbers. look at me
guys, i'm cool.</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">damnit...alcohol is kiickin
in. PART_3: Reading</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Ok, i'm sober again. Reading is an important
technique/skill
hackers master. Being able to read helps you understand the words in book
that give you
elite k-rad</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">knowledge. Call 1800-abcdefg for more info on
how to read. once
you learn how to read, you're all set.</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Section 13: Why Hack? By: BudWeisErz</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">This question has stumped man kind sense the
beginning of time.
After many years of studding I have concluded to the answer. It is very
difficult to
understand</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">this conclusion. So people who are not K-Rad
Hax0rs:</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">1) Pick up a sledge hammer</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">2) Hit yourself in the head 5 times</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">3) Say &quot;Owe&quot; or if you prefer
&quot;Shit!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">4) Hit the back button on the top left side of
the screen</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">5) And finally say &quot;Josh owns me&quot; 500
times</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">But if you are a K-Rad Hacker, you will
understand this quite
easily. What I have discovered might send the Earth spiraling towards the
sun very fast,
but I'll take</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">my chances. (Note: If it does send the Earth
spiraling towards
the sun very fast...sorry)The answer to the question &quot;Why

idle on irc for so long? I go to all those elite channels and I can never
idle like the
Opz0rs can. Well</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">kiddies what you gotta do is get a crappy ass
computer. Better
yet, the best computer your mommy will buy you, then you have to stick the
worst version
of linux</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">on it that you can find. Don't fix any of the
bugs on it and put
on the worst version of sendmail you can find, then you use ircii to sign
on irc and you
idle in #hack,</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">#phreak, #hacker, you get the idea. To idle like
the best you
need to sign on the busiest server you can find, then you need to place a
10 dollar bill
on top of your</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">computer, no joke, a 10 dollar bill. Then you
cant touch the
computer for a few days, if you touch it, this wont work.(Im not
bullshitting you) Second
you have to be</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">careful not to say ONE word in the channel, no
matter how many
people try to talk to you, you have to not say anything, one thing you can
do is make a
idle away</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">line, that says something like &quot; away:: Im
hax0ring the
fbi, gone[1d14hrs2m]&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Once people see that you've been idle that long,
and you've been
hax0ring, then you'll be the most 31337 person in the channel and everyone
will give you</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Opz0rs and you will become a hero in the h4x0r
world, but be
sure never to talk in the channels, cause if you do then they'll realize
your not 31337,
just some 13</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">year old kid who thinks he a cool ass
faggot. Oh, and be sure to
get on a AOL for your isp service, because thats the best service to idle
on ever, in
order to get on</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">AOL from your 31337 linux box you will have to
get the wine

worry, everyone
will</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">think your 31337 when you come in the channel
with an AOL isp

<p><font face="Technical">OK, I bet youre wondering, &quot;now that i am a
leet h4x0r and
0wn everyone, what can i do now?&quot;. Well, the best place to start is
to make people
ph34r you so much</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">that they cower in abject terror at the very
mention of your
name. This may seem difficult to achieve, but it isnt. Think about what
would make you
super leet0, thats</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">right, being INVINCIBLE, like superman. This is
a log of what
happened to me the other day. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">&lt;h4x0r&gt; sfingaz, you are a cunt, i will
0wn j00. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">&lt;sfingaz&gt; 3y3 ph34r j00 n0r7, f0r 3y3 h4v3
4 f1r3w4||!! </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">&lt;h4x0r&gt; please, forgive me. i meant no
harm. dont hurt me,
Mr Leet, if i may call you that.. or would you prefer Sir? </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Did you see that?? he was TOTALLY 0wn3d. and
because of the
magic word, FIREWALL. Now you may ask, &quot;how can i be as oh so leet
and all 0wn1ng as
you,</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Sir?&quot;, well its easy, simply stop
downloading pr0n for long
enough to get a copy of CONSEAL FIREWALL. this is the program all uber
h4x0rs use to
protect</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">themselves and make themselves
invincible. </font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">Once you have leeched it from a warez/pr0n site
you got off
#exceed, install the program (i dont remember how to do this part, so just
read the
manual) and then</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">you are protected. THEN, connect to AOL and when
conseal pops up
a window saying &quot;allow x.x.x.x on port x through&quot; or something
like that, just
click accept,</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">cause thats how you make your own CUSTOM SUPER
LEETO BURRITO
FIREWALL RULESET. Initially it may take a while of clicking accept, but
eventually you</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">will own everyone cause you will have the
leetest and most
complete ruleset ever, and noone will be able to mess with you, and if
they try, you can
make them</font></p>

<p><font face="Technical">ph33r just like i do. </font></font></p>
