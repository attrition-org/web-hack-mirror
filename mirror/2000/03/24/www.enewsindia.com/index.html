<center><b>India, a Terrorist State</b>
<p>The massive repressive tactics of the Indian Security Forces
<br>in the State of Punjab have drawn harsh criticism from both
<br>inside and outside India. At one stage, the hatred
<br>amongst the Sikh community for the Indian Government
<br>had reached such a stage that the years old trusted
<br>Sikh bodyguards of the then Indian P.M. Indira Gandhi
<br>could not restrain themselves and shot her dead in her
<br>official residence.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>India has actively organized and funded a proxy civil war
<br>in Sri-Lanka to bring the country to its heels. It is
<br>now an open secret that Rajiv Gandhi, the ex-Premier
<br>if India, took personal interest in the formation and
<br>activities of the terrorist outfit LTTE in northern
<br>Sri-Lanka. He used LTTE to blackmail Sri-Lanka in order
<br>to bring its foreign policy in-line with that of India.
<br>The violence that followed has destroyed Sri-Lanka's
<br>tourism based economy and caused a lot of bloodshed.
<br>Hatred against such activities was obvious when
<br>Rajiv Gandhi got beaten with a stick by a Sri-Lankan
<br>Guard, when the Indian Premier was taking a Guard
<br>of "Honor" while on a "good-will visit" to that
<br>country. This happened in front of cameras for the rest
<br>of the world to see. The havoc brought forward by
<br>terrorism in Sri-Lanka eventually resulted by the
<br>death of Rajiv Gandhi in a suicide bomb attack, by the
<br>same LTTE he formed and funded but later withdrew
<br>support from, once his objectives had changed.
<br>These facts clearly portray that both sides in the
<br>current Sri-Lankan conflict are aware of and detest the
<br>role of India in fomenting trouble in their erstwhile
<br>peaceful country.
<br>Even now, India is actively engaged in terrorist ventures
<br>in neighboring Pakistan where there are bombs being
<br>exploded every now and then. Also another novelty
<br>of RAW's modus operandi is the sniper phenomenon,
<br>where RAW agents appear randomly in the streets of
<br>Karachi and fire indiscriminately at innocent
<br>civilians. No cause can be attributed to such senseless
<br>acts, only that in private Indians claim that such acts
<br>are a "tit-for-tat" for Pakistan's "involvement" in
<br>Kashmir.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>India's dismal record in upholding the human rights
<br>of its minorities is not limited to Eastern Punjab and the
<br>Occupied Kashmir alone. Its brutal massacres of the
<br>members of its Naga minority is yet another example of
<br>India's utter disregard for the value of human rights of
<br>its minorities. The destruction of Babri Mosque
<br>in Ayodhya by Hindu fanatics, was openly
<br>supported by the fundamentalist Hindu
<br>Government, which forcibly stopped the local Muslims
<br>from going and saving one of their most holy and ancient
<br>places of worship. The police openly helped Hindu fanatics
<br>tear the historic mosque down. This was followed by
<br>bloody riots in Bombay, where the local police
<br>watched mobs of hateful Hindu zealouts slay Muslims
<br>to their deaths. Even women and children were not
<br>spared. An inquiry was forced to be opened as to
<br>ascertain the partisan behavior of local administration
<br>but was killed by the Hindu extremist government as being
<br>'unnecessary'. Later the fundamentalist government
<br>accused local Muslims for the carnage and started
<br>expelling them without mercy from their homes in and
<br>around Bombay.
<br><b>Such is the true face of "secular" India.</b></center>
