    friends and fiends!&nbsp; It's nytek again, (a.k.a. Opiat3) with another
    short message for the masses.&nbsp; I must say before I get started, this
    defacement is in response to ph33r the b33r's one more than anything else.&nbsp;</font>
    <hr>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img name="frontpage_r02_c1" src="frontpage_r02_c1.jpg" width="640" height="101" border="0"></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="3">Ok,
    I was reading through the defacements tonight, and was sort of caught off
    guard when I had received&nbsp;commentary on one of my last works.&nbsp;
    Now,&nbsp; it's not the simple fact that someone had commented, but just how
    it came through, leaving me with mixed emotions.&nbsp; Thanks for responding
    though,&nbsp; kept me thinking, and thinking on most levels is good.&nbsp;
    heh heh&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'm not sure who ph33r the b33r exactly is,&nbsp; but I'm glad that they
    agreed with me, even if it is to some minute extent.&nbsp; However, one
    particular point of their text stuck in my mind.&nbsp;<i><b>&quot;<a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/2000/03/24/www.vsmith.com"><FONT color=#ffffff>Don't even argue when i say war = progress, because it
    </FONT></a></b></i><a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/2000/03/24/www.vsmith.com"><FONT color=#ffffff><i><u><b>does</b></u></i></FONT></a></font><b><i><a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/2000/03/24/www.vsmith.com"><font color="#ffffff" size="3">&quot;.</u></font></a><font color="#ffffff" size="3">
    </font></i></b><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Well,&nbsp;
    those were good examples they gave, but if we dig deeper into it, what does
    that say about humans?&nbsp; We need destruction and chaos which slows us
    down, in order to speed us up technological wise in a punctuated equilibrium
    type effect, as in short bursts over long periods of time..?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So
    yes my friends, I too agree with them to a certain point on that when things
    get shaken up, we are encouraged to produce better things.&nbsp;
    HOWEVER,&nbsp; I don't feel that war is the total answer for all of
    this.&nbsp; &quot;Necessity is the mother of invention&quot;, a wise man
    once said.&nbsp; It's not because we had war that we made these great items,
    it's because we needed something to get a said job done.&nbsp; This means
    that if the government sees something as an object in their daily obstacle
    course, they'll develop something to get passed it, and then maybe release
    it into the public for our use..&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    So, While war is a good catalyst for improvement, it's not the best
    reason.&nbsp; If it takes that many lives to make a car, or to have a
    computer, maybe the whole human race should have just been completely
    obliterated by some godly act, to save the pain we would cause for each
    other later on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who needs technology if we would never have
    existed?&nbsp; Think about it my friends.&nbsp; No pollution, no hunger, no
    bombs, no nothing.&nbsp; What I'm simply trying to say is that people are
    violent by nature of course, and war does make way for improvement, but what
    makes for war?&nbsp; That brings me back to the point about egos clashing,
    and the quest for being the best starting avoidable conflicts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Oh yeah, and also.&nbsp; I don't think you (ph33r the b33r) fully got what I
    was saying when I said unite.&nbsp; Teams are cool to belong to for a small
    unity, a tribe, a family and such.&nbsp; When I said unity, I mean as in
    within all the hackers and all the groups alike.&nbsp; It's most likely
    never going to happen with us all,&nbsp; yeah.. but if you try to be
    ethical, and I do, and everyone else trys to, that would make everyone
    great.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    On one last note, I'm glad I have reached anyone, and even if anyone has
    disagreed, I still have made people think.&nbsp; People don't seem to be
    doing that anymore these days (homogenous haircut people, pokemon kids,
    boy-band freaks).&nbsp; Question everything right and wrong.&nbsp; Question
    your religion, question why you question, and question everything you
    do.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have fun, and good luck to everyone in &quot;the
    scene&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,&nbsp; I'm heading out to a rave
    hopefully.&nbsp; See ya.</font></p>
