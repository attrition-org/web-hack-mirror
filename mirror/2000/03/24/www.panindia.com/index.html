<center><b>Kashmir is NOT an Integral Part of India</b>
<p>India often makes hollow claims to the tune that
<br>Kashmir is an integral part of India. This argument,
<br>often put forward by the Indian leaders, is used to
<br>tell the world at large that they have no business
<br>meddling in India's internal policies. They claim
<br>that the so-called "Instrument of Accession" as
<br>purportedly signed by the ex-Maharajah of Kashmir,
<br>makes Kashmir an integral part of India. But by
<br>invading the princely states of Junagadh and Manavadar,
<br>whose rulers had acceded to Pakistan, and Hyderabad
<br>whose ruler had chosen to remain independent, and
<br>ensuring their accession to India by holding general
<br>plebiscites by force of arms there, India had itself
<br>invalidated the right of the rulers of princely states
<br>to decide their subjects' futures.
<br>It is well accepted nowadays that even the existence of
<br>such an "Instrument" as signed by the ruler of Jammu
<br>&amp; Kashmir is highly suspect. The fact that Maharajah was
<br>overthrown by his own people in a massive uprising, and
<br>that he had already fled from his capital, when he
<br>supposedly signed the "Instrument" to get the Indian
<br>"help", casts further doubts on the validity of the
<br>document. As per international law, as is evident from
<br>the various UN resolutions, Kashmir is a disputed
<br>territory, occupied forcefully by India, and whose fate
<br>is pending an impartial plebiscite to be held under UN
<br>auspices. The Indian leaders who had initially taken the
<br>Kashmir dispute to the UN had publicly and repeatedly
<br>accepted the United Nations' positions and had promised
<br>to abide by it.
<br>Hence it is quite obvious that India is illegally
<br>occupying the State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, in defiance to
<br>the International Law, and that it is an offender in
<br>the current conflict.</center>
