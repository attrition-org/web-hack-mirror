back the old school :D<HR></FONT></CENTER></H5>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Hey everyone. Me, your favourite h4x0r
kiddie, is back again. I have looked at all the sites on the net
( i have time to look at) and am ashamed. The security on the
net is pathetic! It makes me happy and angry, knowing that I am
part of a society that knows everything about the internet. And
this makes me happy.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">But...</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Today was very bad. Depressive in
fact. It started off with me reminded of what I did yesterday.
I caused some shit and it cost my parents alot of money. I'm such
a fucking idiot. I shouldn't have done it, and i'm stupid.Then
i went to school to see my shitty marks :|. Even worse, failing
3 classes. Damn that sucks.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Next i find out that some fucking
black kid STILL wants to fight me, for no fucking reason whatsoever.
That is so fucking ghey, i thought i resolved this shit.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Then i come home, to see a cop car.
This fucks me up bad, cause im starting to get paranoid about
these hacks. I don't wanna be arrested....</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">But...there are those who are by me
:)</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">I would want to officially thank my
ex (well it's been a year and something) fei and my good friend
serena. They were there backing me up, telling me that i'm a good
guy and girls might like me :D</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">heh i guess thats cool...</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">fei: thanks for the help. You have
affected my life (for the better) more then most people have.
I hope u and me can chill and drink a beer or 4 :)</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">serena: your really hot. Don't let
anyone tell you otherwise. You are also very nice, and it's insides
that count. Right?</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Ok, nytek or whoever the fuck u used
to be, I agree with u to a point.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Digital wars do break up the underground
and make us apart. We do not care for the real issues in the world,
and we don't care about being caught. I think we should unite,
thats the point of groups my friend :)</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">But,</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">It is a proven fact that progress
= war. I saw it myself. My group was crazy exploiting servers
like mad, all to get back at the fucks we get. Now this might
seem childish, but it did help motivate the group. Don't even
argue when i say war = progress, because it does.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Without ww1, we wouldnt have cars.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Without ww2, we wouldn't have computers.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Without the cold war, we wouldn't
have internet.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">So, maybe i should stop punking off
the brazilians. And start worrying about getting myself away from
the oinks :D</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Maybe if they started speaking english
then i could respect them, cause i would know what there saying.</FONT></I></P>
