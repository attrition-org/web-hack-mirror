In each and every one 
of us there is a <b>hacker</b> and an ability to
<b>0wn</b> the masses.  We are the <b>lamer</b> movers and the earth
shakers, we conduct our symphony as the nameless <b>h4x0rz</b> come together
and join <b>UiX</b> to make one move through <b>0wn3rsh1p</b>.  The conductor stands behind
the decks and plays his symphony matching every precise <b>hack</b> with perfection,
holding back all, until the right moment to <b>r00t y0 4ss</b>. Mitnick, Mosthated, gH all
amazed by this <b>journey</b> that they started so long ago.  And so we <b>unite</b>, with a
message to spread, that <b>we will not go quietly into the night</b>.  We will be
heard by everyone until there is no one left to <b>0wn</b> and even then we
will hack on.  As we <b>express</b> our <b>views</b> and our <b>dreams</b>, we
<b>fucking HACK</b>, a movement unmatched by no one.
And the hack goes on....
