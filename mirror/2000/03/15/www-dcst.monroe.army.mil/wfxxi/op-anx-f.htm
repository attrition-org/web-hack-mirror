1.  SITUATION:<p><menu>

  a.  Every training event should have an associated After Action Review (AAR) in
which the participants, sometimes assisted by a facilitator, examine the results of the
training event to determine:  what happened, why did it happen, and how to improve
performance <a NAME="fig-1"></a><a HREF="opanx-f1.htm">(Figure 1)</a>.  Answering these three key questions is integral to the training feedback loop and is an essential part of the Army's training doctrine.  AARs are performed at all echelons, from individual/crew to theater level. <p>

  b.  To support the AAR, many training systems have a means of capturing, storing, and retrieving relevant data.  In some cases, these AAR systems were developed concurrently and in conjunction with the Training Aids, Devices, Simulations, and Simulators (TADSS), while in others the AAR system was added later.  In the future, all AAR systems will be developed concurrently and in conjunction with the TADSS, and most will be embedded. Generally speaking, current AAR systems facilitate training feedback to the unit; however, a system of establishing standards for this support, in the form of standardized protocols has not been developed Army wide.  Clearly, the data necessary to support an infantry company (Co) AAR will be vastly different than that necessary for a division level AAR; however, there is no reason that all company level AAR products cannot be standard, no matter whether the training event takes place at the National Training Center (NTC) or in a simulation  <a NAME="fig-2"></a><a HREF="opanx-f2.htm">(Figure 2)</a>). <p>

  c.  The Army trains in three distinct simulation environments:  live, virtual, and constructive.  In the live environment, soldiers actually deploy on terrain with their weapons systems.  Although optimal for
many types of training, live exercises are expensive and, due to environmental and
safety requirements, will probably have significant artificial constraints.  The maneuver
Combat Training Centers (CTCs) are the most obvious example of training in the live
environment.  In the virtual environment, simulators take the place of terrain and
weapons systems.  The soldier sees a &quot;virtual&quot; image of the battlefield in the simulator
and takes appropriate action.  Several simulators can be linked together to expand the
scope of the training event.  Virtual training has the advantage of allowing soldiers to
perform tasks too dangerous for the live environment (such as calling for artillery fires
while moving), as well as having the capability for rapid changes to scenario and
retraining specific tasks.  However, virtual training is in its infancy, and current
technology is both expensive (initial investment) and limited to individual and small unit
training.  In the constructive environment no attempt is made to directly replicate an
actual view of the battlefield.  Instead, individual systems and small units are merged
into &quot;icons&quot; which are displayed on a screen.  Results of tactical engagements are
determined by the capabilities of these merged units and the quality of their tactical
employment.  Constructive simulations can train units at any echelon; however,
because of the characteristics of this environment - merged units, abstract visual
information, etc - it is most effective in training staffs and units larger than company
size.   The Synthetic Theater of War (STOW) links two or more of environments in a
training event; i.e., a brigade having one of its battalions in the NTC &quot;box&quot; and the other
two playing constructively on Brigade/Battalion Battle Simulation (BBS).<p>

  d.  Currently, each environment has numerous, non-standard AAR systems through which they cannot transfer data among themselves, gather the same data, or display data
in a standardized format.  The lack of standardization has implications to the trainer, developer, and analyst.  This means the trainer cannot rely on a standardized output on which to base an AAR; e.g., since there are no requirements documents specifying
how the data is collected,  stored, or displayed the trainer must become an expert on the instrumentation in order to give an AAR .  Finally,  Army Training Digital Library (ATDL) input is manual, and lessons learned are left to the skill of the analyst using the data.  Data valuable to the force developer and material developer is not available in the current systems  <a NAME="fig-3"></a><a HREF="opanx-f3.htm">(Figure 3)</a>. 
<p>

  e.  AAR products must be:<p><menu>

     (1) Standardized by tactical echelon, regardless of the training environment
(live, virtual, constructive) if the Army is to achieve the goal of moving into the 
21st Century. 
<p>

     (2) Present the same teaching points, more accurately supporting both the unit
and the development of long term trends (lessons learned) for the Army.
<p>

     (3)  Reduce the requirement for Observer Controller (OC)/AAR facilitator
expertise.  With AAR standardized products the OC/facilitator will be a training doctrine
expert, not an instrumentation expert.  Standardization allows more automated and
semi-automated products, reducing time and contractor support, and helping to rapidly
focus the AAR.
  <p>

     (4) Provide an interface vehicle, in the form of standardized data by echelon, to
the other Distributive Interactive Simulations (DIS) domains: Research, Development
and Analysis (RDA), Advanced Concepts &amp; Requirements (ACR), and Training
Exercises and Military Operations (TEMO), to validate current programs and provide a foundation for future initiatives  <a NAME="fig-4"></a><a HREF="opanx-f4.htm">(Figure 4)</a>.<p>

    (5) Support training studies with data to develop strategies using the best mix of events in the live, virtual, and constructive environments.

2.  MISSION:  The Standard Army After Action Review System (STAARS) supports training, mission rehearsals, and research/experimentation at all echelons from individual to echelons above corps (EAC) with packages of AAR products standardized by echelon and across the Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) and Joint tasks at the operational level.  Standardized products generated in the live, virtual, and/or constructive environments will be appropriate for each echelon receiving an AAR.  STAARS will
support multi-echelon training and mission rehearsals for high cost training exercises and worldwide contingency operations in a combination of live, virtual, and constructive environments with each participating echelon having access to the appropriate standardized AAR products.  STAARS will support Joint exercises and mission rehearsals.  STAARS will support the unit commander as well as the TEMO, ACR and RDA communities via the ATDL.
<p>

3.  EXECUTION:<p><menu>
  
 a.  STAARS provides the trainer a standard tool to evaluate the effectiveness of
training.  This translates into improved feedback on training doctrine, resource
utilization, changes to Doctrine, Training, Leader Development, Organization, Materiel,
and Soldier Systems (DTLOMS), and individual/crew training records by the user.  
<p><menu>

     (1) encompasses the collection, processing, and distribution capabilities
necessary to improve the AAR process.<p>

     (2) provides standardized products at each echelon.  <p>

     (3) interfaces with current and future simulation systems, including models using
the Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol (ALSP), local area networks, and wide area
networks.  <p>
     
     (4) supports the training feedback needed for trainers to capitalize on the
training events.  <p>

     (5) is capable of operation in remote and non-remote communications
configurations.  <p>

     (6) is DIS compatible, compliant, and interoperable.<p>
    
     (7) is compatible with TADSS, and embedded training systems.<p>

     (8) provides for development of leader development training concepts, methods,
and strategies in support of battle command concepts and doctrine.    <p>

     (9) provides a capability to translate lessons learned from the Center for Army
Lessons Learned (CALL), Battle Command Battle Lab experiments (BCBL), CTC
rotations, and other sources into leader development and collective training concepts,
methods, and strategies.  <p>

     (10) captures initiatives and lessons learned from throughout the training
community (including industry and academia); evaluates and incorporates into Army
leader development and collective training concepts, methods, and strategies.<p></menu>

 b.  STAARS will integrate information from all existing AAR systems.  In the long
term, all future systems will be  designed to provide input to STAARS.  Future
Command and Control (C2) systems will have embedded STAARS so the system can
provide feedback either at home station or while deployed<p>

  c.  Development of STAARS provides, for the first time, standardized data collection
sought by the commander, trainers, Total Army School System (TASS), combat
developers, doctrine writers, resource  managers, lessons learned collectors, training
developers, testers, analysts and individuals.  Additionally, STAARS incorporates and
integrates both tester, developer, and trainer data to reduce duplication of effort in
collection of information for the design and implementation of new systems.<p> 

  d.  STAARS is not a stand alone system.  There are many sources of existing
information to compile into an initial database. By design, STAARS will accept standard
format information from live, virtual, constructive, and STOW training exercises;
contingency operations, Department of the Army (DA), and the TASS.  STAARS
accesses evaluations, captures lessons learned, documents,  resource usage, and
feeds standardized information into the ATDL for storage and feedback into the
Standard Army Training System (SATS).  The information collected  is easily accessed
through automated links to the ATDL.<p>
 
  e.  Milestones:  STAARS is a dynamic program that will be upgraded to meet the
continually changing requirements of the user.  Following are the major milestones
projected over the next several years:<p> <menu>

     (1) FY 95, Mission Needs Statement.  This Mission Needs Statement (MNS)
supports peacetime, pre-deployment, deployment and post-deployment training,
mission rehearsal, and execution for the Total Army to include Active and Reserve
Component (AC/RC) programs.  It responds to Defense Planning Guidance (DPG), the
Joint Training Master Plan (JTMP), and the Warfighter XXI (WF XXI) training concept. 
All emphasize the increased use of simulations for training and mission rehearsal at all
echelons.  The standard AAR capabilities are needed to support the following
strategies associated with the synthetic Distributed Interactive Simulations (DIS) Master
Plan and stand alone simulations in the live, virtual, and constructive environments.<p>


     (2) FY 95, Action Plan. The STAARS Action Plan (AP) was approved 22
January 1996.  The AP outlines key events, milestones, and agencies necessary to
establish a STAARS. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Training (DCST), TRADOC with the
National Simulations Center (NSC) as the executive agent, develops a Standard Army
After Action Review System (STAARS) to support training rehearsals, and
research/experimentation at all echelons from squad/crew to corps with packages of
AAR products standardized by echelon and Battlefield Operating System (BOS). 
Standardized products generated in the live, virtual, and/or constructive environments
will be identical or nearly identical for each echelon receiving the AAR.  STAARS will
support multi-echelon training and rehearsals for high cost training exercises and
worldwide contingency operations in a combination of live, virtual, and constructive
environments with each participating echelon having access to the appropriate
standardized AAR products.  STAARS will support Army in Joint exercises and
rehearsals.  STAARS will support the unit commander as well as the TEMO, ACR, and
RDA communities and provide an automated collection, storage, retrieval, and
distribution system for the Army for the year 2000 and beyond. <p>

     (3) FY 96, Operational Requirements Document (ORD).  This document is
designed to: provide the materiel developer with the minimum acceptable device
requirements, capabilities, and operational standards needed to meet the MNS; alert
the materiel development and training communities to anticipated logistics support for
the proposed device; distribute advance planning information regarding training
requirements and criteria associated with operation and maintenance of the proposed
device; and, to allow a milestone I/II decision to permit the training device acquisition
program to proceed to phase I and II, Demonstration and Validation/Engineering and
Manufacturing.<p>

     (4) FY 97, Version 2 STAARS Handbook.  The handbook is developed to
provide Army trainers, TADSS developers, and training analysts guidance concerning
AAR products.  It shows those standard products the developer is required to
incorporate in simulation in order that they be available to the AAR facilitator (trainer)
and so that results can be readily transmitted via the ATDL. <p>
     
     (5)  FY 97,  NSC will prepare a Request for Proposal (RFP) for contracting and
have over sight of the acquisition process.<p>

    (6)  FY 00,  STAARS 1.0 will establish requirements for standardized/ automated
Brigade/Division  (Bde/Div) AAR products across the three environments in concert
with the fielding of Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) for Platoon (Plt) through
Battalion (Bn).  STAARS 1.0 is defined as having one suite of software and hardware
installed at Fort Leavenworth by the end of FY 2000.
<p>

    (7)  FY 00, STAARS will under go its Initial Operational Capabilities Evaluation
(IOCE).
<p>

    (8)  FY 04,  STAARS will under go its Final Operational Capabilities Evaluation
(FOCE).<p>
  
     (9)  FY 05.  By the year 2005 STAARS will be embedded in TADSS.
STAARS will begin as a consolidation of products from existing systems.  As STAARS 
requirements evolve,  products will be automated and standardized by echelon across
the three environments (live, virtual, constructive) starting with Bde/Div products.
Initially, STAARS 1.0 will consist of requirements that AAR systems must meet (ie., DIS
compliant, compatible, and interoperable).  The CTC instrumentation systems will
continue to be improved and enhanced to accommodate the new generation of digital
Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS), computer based warfighting systems, and
become DIS compliant, compatible and interoperable.  Precision Range Instrumentation
Maneuver Exercise (PRIME) like systems will continue to enhance home station range
instrumentation simulation.  As CCTT and WARSIM are fielded these requirements
will be incorporated into these systems.  As CCTT and WARSIM mature the STAARS requirements will evolve into a single true STAARS to be embedded in 
TADSS  <a NAME="fig-5"></a><a HREF="opanx-f5.htm">(Figure 5)</a>.<p></menu> </menu>
