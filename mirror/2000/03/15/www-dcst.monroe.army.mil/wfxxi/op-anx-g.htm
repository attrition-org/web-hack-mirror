1. SITUATION:<p><menu>

     a.  The ever growing need for digitized data is evidenced by the proliferation of information systems throughout the Army. To date most of these systems have been stove piped to meet the specific and narrowly focused needs of the user.  Attempts to provide broader based  corporate  type
databases have met with varied success. Developments in information sharing technologies now give us the unique opportunity to develop seamless,  relational databases, and libraries without walls. 
These technologies will provide leaders and soldiers at all levels with an almost limitless
fount of information and the ability to pare it down to only the information desired.  A seamless interface, combined with a relational data repository, will provide the required inputs and outputs by the other four WFXXI components.<p>

     b.  The Army's digital library will satisfy the traditional definition of a library,  A
collection of information organized for use .  Much time and effort has been given
already to the collection and organization of digitized manuals, lessons learned, and
other reports. The results of these efforts, any number of remote &quot;libraries&quot;, will be
made available through the Army Training Digital Library (ATDL).  The ATDL will
further identify, gather, and integrate training information systems data.  By
accomplishing these objectives, the digital library will maximize the use of information
age technology to support Army training.<p>

     c.  The ATDL will provide a broad range of support to Army training.  Support will
include fundamental library functions and services.  This support will at least include
the acquisition, preservation and dissemination of information to train, educate, assist,
and inform.  Successfully implementing the ATDL will employ an organizational
structure to ensure a broad and comprehensive range of library services.  The digital
library organizational structure will result in the combination of diverse, complex,
technologies to achieve a robust library capability.<p>

     d.  Implementing the ATDL will require much work, including work yet to be defined. 
The ATDL will implement modern, relational database technology to store and retrieve
training information based on the latest available training data.  Training and doctrine
data to be accessible by, or stored within the ATDL, will be made fully compliant with
DOD data element standards. <p></menu>

2.  MISSION:  To provide a globally accessible, digital repository of training knowledge
sets and interactive applications to support training of individuals and units.<p>

3.  EXECUTION:<p><menu>

     a.  Training related data is available through information systems at virtually every
Army activity and site.  Generally, these information systems are designed and
developed to meet a specific need.  We refer to these as  stove pipe  systems because
of their vertical focus:  little or no information exchange outside of their specific area of
interest/concern.<p><menu>

          (1)  The ATDL will be designed and developed to provide a horizontal latitude to
all training information systems and their associated data.  Through the appropriate
application of commercial technology, it will be an interface to training data, presenting
a  Corporate  view to this data.  Technology will be applied that will allow access to
standardized training data, both centrally and at remote sites, in a manner transparent
to the user.<p>

          (2)  Technology can be, and has been, applied to facilitate access to training
information.  Documents have been scanned/digitized, and kept on a computer system. 
An individual may use the digitized information by establishing a computer connection
to the host computer system.  The ATDL will implement modern technology that goes
beyond conventional library methods, providing access to the latest training data
available.<p>

          (3)  Commercial software will facilitate extending the ATDL, via the Internet, to a
worldwide audience.  A soldier anywhere in the world may access the ATDL, browse
information, and extract as much or as little as necessary.  Access will not require any
special equipment, other than a PC, a modem, and appropriate software.  Any
specialized software required will be identified and/or made available through the
TRAINER-ON-LINE Home Page and Army Training Support Center's (ATSC) electronic
bulletin board system. <p>

          (4)  The World Wide Web (WWW) and Internet will be the primary means of
access to the ATDL.   ATSC will provide Internet access through its existing bulletin
board system for those activities who do not have Internet access available to them. 
ATSC will develop and maintain a list of known Internet access sites and addresses on
its bulletin board system, and on the TRAINER-ON-LINE Home Page.<p>

          (5)  Appropriate protocols must be established to support access to, and
exchange of information contained within the ATDL.   Inter-database connectivity will
be based upon Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) standards.  This is an industry
standard which all major database vendors are already compliant with, or for which
they are developing compliant interfaces.  Communications between sites will be
accomplished through client /server architecture using windows Graphical User
Interface (GUI) access through MILNET and Internet protocols.  Intent is to make ATDL
data available to end users at their individual work stations.<p>

          (6)  Minimal hardware requirements must be satisfied at each site.  Sites will be
brought  on-line  as their information systems are brought into standard consistent with
the Army Training Information Management Program (ATIMP).  Access to the ATDL 
will be supported in the Windows environment.  Use of Windows capabilities will
provide a simple, Graphical User Interface (GUI).  Software for initial entry to the ATDL
may be commercially purchased or available  freeware  versions may be used.  Free
versions of Internet software will be available on the ATSC bulletin board system.<p>

          (7)  Communication capabilities are essential to effective use of the ATDL.  The
best design and implementation will fail if communications are slow.  Initial
implementation will utilize compression routines to reduce file sizes and attempt to
improve performance.  Performance will be monitored and communication upgrades
determined if file compression does not provide an acceptable solution.  Efforts will be
made to leverage the communications improvements being explored through
cooperative efforts between communications companies and the Army.  The use of
fiber optics and high speed switches will also be explored.<p>

     (8)  Use of emerging systems and technologies promise to provide data to units
in a fashion which will reduce administrative burden and increase efficiency.  However,
unilateral or stove pipe development is no longer feasible.  The Army Training
Information Management Program (ATIMP) will be the forum/agency to ensure this
does not happen.  The ATIMP will establish the overarching architecture for systems
feeding or accessing the ATDL.  ATIMP will deal with broad automation issues such as
communications, documentation, data element definition, interservice integration, and
life cycle management.  Department of the Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations is
the proponent and ATSC is the executive agent for ATIMP.  In order to accomplish this
mission, the ATIMP will:<p><menu>

       (a)  Establish an electronic forum to monitor and report a detailed status of
legacy, emerging, developed, and dying systems.  This forum will use WWW protocols
and be conducted through the ATSC Home Page.<p>

       (b)  Create, in order, a program plan, an Army pamphlet, and an Army
regulation that, in total will assist system developers and users to maximize capabilities
and reduce system development times by sharing information and agreed to
architectures.<p>

       (c)  Serve as an advocate for Warfighter XXI systems seeking to integrate
into the ATDL or share capabilities between systems.<p>

       (d)  Implement appropriate control mechanisms that will maintain the
automation integrity of Warfighter XXI.<p></menu></menu>

The following systems are examples of ATIMP being fielded or developed:   <p> <ul>
      
     <li>   Standard Army Training System (SATS) - Version 4 will provide units
from squad through Department of the Army (DA) with the ability to implement the
training management doctrine contained in Field Manual (FM) 25-100, FM 25-101, and
FM 100-5.  In addition, SATS, through its interface with the ATDL, will allow the
accurate roll up of resources planned and expended in support of training.  The use of
relational database technology will allow the trainer to tailor the training program to
meet the specific Mission Essential Task List (METL) of the unit.  The ability to accept
evaluation and lessons learned data back into the system will also be available. <p> 
                         
 <li>  Automated Systems Approach to Training (ASAT) - ASAT is a fielded
software application which supports total Army training development, management, and
support requirements.  The principal user of ASAT is the TRADOC proponent. The
ASAT capabilities include total task management and production of battle focused
training and training products.  ASAT provides outputs to SATS and will receive
feedback from SATS Version 4.0.  ASAT supports the electronic and print publications
of extension training products including Mission Training Plans and Soldier Training
Publications.  The software will also support the creation of the proponent initiated
CATS and Warfighter XXI TSPs.  The system provides for the development,
standardization, and management of training information that is tasked-based from a
link to TOE/SRC through Major End Items, to all Occupational Speciality linkages and
linkages to all doctrine and references.  ASAT 4.0 will support the production of
doctrine. <p> 

 <li>  Automated Instructional Management System Redesign (AIMS-R) - AIMS-R is designed as an interactive training information management system to provide Army schools, training centers, and Non Commissioned Officer (NCO) Academies the capability to develop, administer and monitor resident and nonresident (correspondence and self-development) individual training during peacetime and
mobilization.  AIMS-R automates course development, student management, grade
book management, testing and evaluation of students, inventory management,
worldwide distribution and printing of instructional and testing materials, scheduling of
classes, events, and resources, to include impact analysis of &quot;what if&quot;, and archival of
historical records.  To facilitate use of the automated information AIMS-R interfaces
with ASAT, Army Training Resource Requirements System (ATRRS), Army Civilian
Personnel System (ACPERS), Total Army Personnel Data Base (TAPDB) and other
various training support systems. <p> 
 
 <li>  Force XXI Infonet - The Infonet currently serves as the gateway system
for the Army Knowledge Network (AKN) and for accessing selected Army databases. 
These include the Automated Historical Archives System (AHAS), Combat Training
Center's Warrior Information Network (CTC WIN), Center for Army Lessons Learned
(CALL) databases, and Force XXI databases.  Force XXI Infonet is a combination of
hardware and software containing the necessary protocols and a menu system for
entering the various associated systems provided to the user.
 <li> AKN - This system implements the TRADOC CG's directive to &quot;bring the
Army's corporate knowledge through an easy-to-use GUI to every computer in every
Army office, research center and Tactical Operations Center (TOC), and equip every
user with the capability to retrieve, analyze, tailor and present sets of that knowledge&quot;. 
When fully developed, AKN will become the &quot;library without walls&quot;.  Building on the
base provided by the Force XXI Infonet, it will be a key component of an interactive
library which allows multimedia applications, storage and retrieval of doctrine
publications, access to training development and training support applications, and
access to a relational database.</ul><p>
