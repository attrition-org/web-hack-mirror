1.  SITUATION:  The Standard Army Training System (SATS) is a computer based
software system that automates training management doctrine found in 
Field Manual (FM) 25-100, Training the Force, FM 25-101, Battle Focused Training,
and FM 100-5, Operations.  SATS provides the capability to incorporate training plans
and products, readiness reporting tools, calendars (3 dimensional), schedules, all unit
activities and related data bases at all echelons, and computes associated resources. 
SATS accesses and shares information with the Army Training Digital Library (ATDL)
components as well as other Warfighter XXI (WF XXI) components.
<p>
2.  MISSION:  To provide commanders and training managers a user friendly
automated training management system to enhance the planning, resourcing,
scheduling and assessing of unit training for America's Army.
<p>
3.  EXECUTION:  
<p>
<menu>
     a. Concept
<p>
<menu>
        (1)  SATS version 4.0 will serve as the keystone Army effort to bring training
management into the 21st century.  This system combines training doctrine with
automation technologies to help trainers develop and manage their training programs. 
Future SATS (version 4.x) will provide enhancements to better support the needs of 
both active and reserve component units with a wide array of training management
features.  Using Microsoft Windows, SATS 4.x will be Local Area Network (LAN) and
Wide Area Network (WAN) capable, and interface with other WF XXI components.
<p>
        (2)  SATS will assist commanders as they: 
<p>
<menu>
         (a)  Develop and refine their unit Mission Essential Task List (METL). 
<p>
         (b)  Develop and refine their unit training priorities.
<p>
         (c)  Implement and resource higher headquarters' training guidance.
<p>
         (d)  Assess and report unit's current training status and resource usage.
<p>
        (e)  Develop multiple structured training plan options and select the optimal
training plan.
<p>
</menu>
      (3)  SATS assists training managers as they:
<p>
<menu>
         (a)  Implement commander's training guidance.
<p>
         (b)  Produce comprehensive training calendars and other products to support
training.
<p>
         (c)  Integrate doctrinal and institutional (proponent) guidance into training
plans.
<p>
         (d)  Identify and schedule required Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and
Simulations (TADSS), ranges, and other required resources.
<p>
          (e)  Evaluate the effectiveness of training executed based on Standard Army
After Action Review System (STAARS) data.
<p>
         (f)  Adjust plans to accommodate real world, unforeseen requirements. 
<p>
</menu>
        (4)  SATS will link with ongoing WF XXI initiatives, such as Automated Systems
Approach to Training (ASAT) and the Training Module Executive Management
Information System (TEXMIS) to link units to institutions establishing two way, &quot;real
time&quot; transfer of information between collective and institutional training.  For the first
time, students in the 21st century classroom will &quot;plug in&quot; electronically to on-going
training and operations for classroom examples, demonstrations or active participation
by students. 
<p>
       (5)  SATS 4.x uses information contained in functional groupings of tasks to develop
situational training templates.  SATS will recommend event scheduling sequences and
frequencies for the commander's approval.
<p>
<menu>
         (a)  SATS 4.x will provide the capability to electronically transfer information
both laterally and vertically.  Electronic connectivity enables trainers to share
information with peer units and permits them to query their own and subordinate
training plans to view the execution of command training guidance.  
  <p>                           
          (b) SATS 4.x provides requisite training management information to the Department of the
Army (DA).   DA will be able to &quot;roll-up&quot; training resource and readiness data from units and the
Total  Army School System (TASS).  SATS will be built to satisfy all of the software training
management requirements for trainers and training resource managers. 
<p>                             
     (c)  Information generated through SATS will be available  to other users (e.g.
TASS) through the ATDL.
<p>
</menu></menu>
   b.  Milestones:  SATS is a dynamic program
that will be updated frequently to meet the continually changing requirements of the
user.  Following are major milestones projected over the next several years.
<p>
<menu>
      (1)  FY 96, SATS 4.0 fielding.  This version will be a radical change from SATS
currently being used today.  A more user friendly, windows environment will assist the
user in performing a host of functions to support training management.
<p>
      (2)  FY 96 (late), SATS 4.1 fielding.  Many improvements are planned such as
enhanced reports and communications, multi-echelon training exercise planning, and a
training strategy and guidance system.  External system interfaces will be expanded to
allow communications with many of the systems being developed for both the active
and reserve components.
<p>
      (3)  FY 97, SATS 4.2 fielding.  Continued enhancements, updates, and
refinements to all data tables.  Training Operations Plan/ Operations Order
(OPLAN/OPORD) support capability.  Individual and crew level simulator training
results.  Additional interfaces will be made with other related systems as they mature.
<p>
      (4)  FY 97 (late), SATS 4.3 fielding.  Numerous enhancements will be
incorporated  throughout the SATS software.  User input will continue to be key to
providing a responsive system that will significantly reduce the training planning and
execution workload facing units today. 
<p>                             
(5)  FY 99, SATS 5.0 fielding.  New and improved technologies will be incorporated into
SATS allowing a more seamless interface with related systems.  Test beds located
at MACOM sites will rapidly prototype user requirements into software changes for test
and evaluation.  Interoperability will be achieved with common hardware in our
battlefield operating systems.
 <p>                                    
   (6)  FY 01, SATS 6.0 fielding.   SATS will continue to mature, allowing real time
transfer and retrieval of data around the world.  New encryption technologies will be
tested to allow secure two-way data transmission to all echelons of the Army. 
  <p>                                   
   (7)  FY 03, SATS 7.0 fielding.   This state-of-the-art software will be the keystone in
joint and combined training exercises.  Training scenarios and resources requirements
are rapidly generated and allow for &quot;what if&quot; drills to obtain the most effective and cost
efficient training exercises.  Rapid changes to software will be common place and
systems will be upgraded transparently during operation to incorporate new capabilities
 as they are developed.
