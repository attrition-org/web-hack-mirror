1. SITUATION:<p><menu>

  a.  The Army's traditional training goal has been to execute tough, realistic field training exercises as our primary means of training.  However, decreasing resources, environmental constraints, and the
increasing amount of land required by advances in mobility and weapons lethality are limiting the Army's ability to effectively execute these exercises.  Together with the requirement to execute training and
mission rehearsal  in all missions and terrain demanded by modern power projection strategies, these factors prohibit continued reliance of field training as a primary training focus.  The Army is challenged to apply major technology breakthroughs to the training arena just as it has to the operational arena.  Just as digitization is revolutionizing Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and
Intelligence (C4I) for the field forces, advances in computer capabilities are revolutionizing the training battlefield.  <p>

  b.  Field training today is both enhanced and supplemented by Training Aids,
Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS).  The Warfighter (WF) XXI training focus
will be synthetic environments, enhanced and supplemented by capstone field training
exercises.  TADSS developed must not only provide training in specific individual and
collective skills, but will provide mission rehearsal capability, embedded where
appropriate, to provide training when forward deployed and in transit.  Synthetic
environments will provide the first two steps of crawl, walk, and run training, with units
entering the resource intensive &quot;run&quot; of field training only after reaching specific
standards or gates in training.  <p>
  
  c.  In the future the Army will leverage technologies and break the separation of
system and non-system TADSS so embedded and appended devices are available to
effectively train the force to standard at the lowest resource cost.  Where appropriate
and effective TADSS will be Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Compliant,
Compatible and Interoperable (CCI) and Defense Simulation Internet (DSI) compliant
so they may be linked together in advanced training scenarios across the spectrum  of
operations as well as linked  together in joint training exercises. <p></menu>  

2.  MISSION:  To provide unit commanders and institutional trainers with effective and
integrated training tools to train soldiers and units to prescribed standards in the most
resource effective manner.<p>

3.  EXECUTION:<p><menu>

  a.  Concept:  Key to the WF XXI training concept is the interoperability and fidelity
of new and emerging TADSS.  TADSS may interoperate through the Synthetic Theater
of War (STOW) architecture to link the live, virtual, and constructive simulation
environments.  The Army will develop new TADSS and modify existing TADSS with the
intent of reducing training task overlap, and filling training task underlap.  Training
developers will use the Combined Arms Training Strategy (CATS) process and the
developing Standard Army Training System (SATS) 4.x as tools to reduce
TADSS/training task overlap and underlap.  The use of CATS and SATS, combined
with innovative thinking and a synergistic approach to training, will break down vertical
stovepipes in training, between institutional and unit training, and between system and
non-system TADSS.  The Army goal is a resource efficient mix of TADSS having
minimum overlap and making maximum effective use of embedded training capabilities and CCI.<p><menu>

     (1)  TADSS Management. <p><menu>

                          (a)  Background.  Based on recommendations by the Defense Science Board
(DSB) and Army Science Board (ASB) studies, the Secretary of the Army designated
the Department of the Army (DA), Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations (DCSOPS) as the
responsible official for Models and Simulations.  Training and Doctrine Command
(TRADOC) and Army Materiel Command (AMC) were assigned responsibilities  for
requirements integration and program execution respectively.  Within TRADOC, the
Deputy Chief of Staff for Simulations and Analysis (DCSSA) is the executive agent for
DIS and models and simulations, reporting directly  to the Deputy Commanding
General for Combined Arms Center (CAC).  Models and simulations, including DIS, are
currently categorized into three domains, Training Exercises and Military Operations
(TEMO), Advanced Concepts and Requirements (ACR) and Research, Development
and Acquisition (RDA).  Within TRADOC, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Training (DCST)
manages the TEMO domain.   This includes all TADSS. <p>

                   (b)  Responsibilities.  As the domain sponsor for TEMO, TRADOC DCST ensures integration of TADSS requirements within and across all three simulation environments (live, virtual and constructive).  DCST established five charters for TADSS program management as follows:  TRADOC Project Office (TPO) STOW (BCTD- also  the staff agent for DCST); TPO-STOW-A (NSC); TPO Live (ATSC- CTSD); TPO Constructive (NSC) and TRADOC System Manager (TSM) Virtual (NSC- TSM-CATT).  The NSC chairs the Configuration Control Board (CCB).  The Simulation, Training and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM),  is the TADSS materiel developer.<p></menu>
       
     (2)  Current Training Methodology.  <p><menu>

                    (a)  Current training is best described within the concept of the three training
environments, live, virtual and constructive.<p>

                    (b)  Live training is executed in field conditions using tactical equipment and
is normally enhanced by TADSS (training devices, targetry, training-unique ammunition, etc.)  Aside from gunnery training, live maneuver training normally incorporates Tactical Engagement Simulations (TES) to simulate combat conditions.  The TES training methodology is characterized by the free interplay of two forces, using a realtime casualty assessment system that reinforces training tasks through immediate feedback response to correct and incorrect individual and collective task
accomplishment.  Live training is the most resource intensive form of training and is used to reinforce skills previously trained during the crawl and walk stages of crawl-walk-run training progression.<p>

                    (c)  Virtual training is executed using computer generated battlefields in
simulators which approximate the physical layout of tactical weapons systems and
vehicles.  Virtual simulations are stand alone systmes used for certain full and part task
training, notably armored vehicle gunnery and aviation flight and gunnery.  The
common application of virtual simulations, however, is collective training using
Advanced Distributed Simulation (ADS).  Virtual collective training uses the same TES
training methodology as live environment exercises, including free play, real time
casualty assessment, and use of the Standard After Action Review System (STAARS)
process to develop and practice collective skills.  Virtual TES training, although lacking
the fidelity of live simulation, permits units to maneuver over much larger areas without
environmental and safety restrictions, and also permits units to maneuver over terrain
different from their home stations and climates.  <p>
       
                    (d)  Constructive training is the use of computer models and simulations to
exercise the command and staff functions of units from platoons through echelons
above corps.  Constructive simulations permit multiple echelons of command and staff
to execute their normal warfighting tasks in extensive exercises without the resource
constraints of large bodies of troops.  Each constructive simulation requires supporting
resources in the form of personnel in response cells with appropriate work stations.<p></menu>

     (3)  Current TADSS.  TADSS are categorized as either system TADSS or non-
system TADSS.  System TADSS are designed for use with a system, family of systems,
or item of equipment, including subassemblies and components.  They may be stand-
alone, embedded, or appended.  Using system embedded TADSS is the
preferred approach where practical and cost effective. System TADSS are funded by
system Program Manager/Program Executive Office (PM/PEO) and fielded
concurrently with the weapon system.  Non-system TADSS are designed to support
general military training and non-system specific training requirements.  Development
and procurement of non-system TADSS are managed and funded within the Training Mission Area (TMA).   The Army's goal is to procure system TADSS as part of the total system package and eliminate the funding of system specific TADSS under the Army's non-system TADSS program.  The following are examples of current system/non-system TADSS supporting the live, virtual, and
constructive training environments:<p><menu>

                    (a)  Live.  Current live TADSS in common use include the Multiple Integrated
Laser Engagement System (MILES) family of direct fire simulators and the related Air
Ground Engagement System/Air Defense (MILES AGES/AD) family of aviation and air
defense MILES simulators.  Emerging into service use are the Tank Weapons Gunnery 
Simulation System (TWGSS) and Precision Gunnery Simulation (PGS) laser precision
gunnery simulation systems for tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicle (BFV), and MILES
2000 advanced laser casualty assessment simulators.  Various versions of the
Simulation of Area Weapons Effects (SAWE) and Range Data Measurement
Subsystem (RDMS) are in use at the maneuver Combat Training Centers (CTCs).  In
addition, numerous target systems exist to support live fire gunnery and small unit
maneuver training.  The Enhanced Remote Target System (ERETS) and Portable
Remoted Target System (PRETS) are computer based systems used on standard
ranges Army wide.<p> 

    (b)  Virtual.  Common virtual simulations include the Simulation Network (SIMNET)
and Air Network (AIRNET) family of ADS, the Conduct of Fire Trainer (COFT) used for
tank and BFV gunnery, and the Attack Helicopter (AH)-64 Combat Mission Simulator
(CMS) used for flight emergency procedures and combat gunnery training.<p>

   (c)  Constructive.  Constructive simulations in large scale training use include
Janus (platoon and company), Brigade/Battalion Simulation (BBS), Corps Battle
Simulation (CBS) used for division through theater level forces, and Combat Service
Support Tactical Simulation System (CSSTSS).  The Aggregate Level Simulation
Protocol (ALSP) is used to link CBS, CSSTSS, and other service simulations for joint
and theater level exercises.  <p>

  (d)  Synthetic Theater of War (STOW).  STOW is a Synthetic Environment (SE)
used to link two or more of the three simulation environments.  The STOW SE is key to
the Army's transition to the 21st century Army, also know as Force XXI.  STOW is more
than software and hardware.  It is an interlinked SE addressing the four areas of 
problem identification and resolution, prototyping for the future, mission rehearsal, and
training.  STOW is managed within TEMO, but applies to all three domains.  The DA
STOW Campaign Plan and the TRADOC Action Plan provide direction to the various
organizations involved in STOW development.<p></menu>

      

       (4)  Future TADSS.  Future TADSS will use the DIS standards and embedded
training capabilities to provide a training environment that breaks down traditional
stovepipes to allow interoperability across domains and environments and supports
training and mission rehearsal for the power projection force.<p><menu>

                    (a)  DIS.  DIS describes a class of interlinked and interoperable simulators
maintaining a separate view of the common SE, also known as the ADS.  By common
application, it also identifies a common industry standard and those CCI simulations and
simulators.  This standard, the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineer standard 1278,
IEEE 1278-1993 (or IEEE 1278) adopted in 1993 established the technical architecture,
standards and communicative protocols for DIS (ADS), and is both a military procurement
standard and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreements (STANAG)
1278.  IEEE 1278, or DIS, provides the baseline for interlinking and interoperating various
simulations and simulators, both within the virtual environment and into live and constructive
simulations.  DIS provides the technical underpinnings for the STOW effort. When fully
developed, DIS CCI simulations and simulators will permit maneuver, gunnery, C4I, Combat
Support (CS), and Combat Service Support (CSS) training in seamless exercises distributed
across a number of installations using both the Defense Simulation Internet (DSI) and
commercial Wide Area Network (WAN).<p>

 (b)  Embedded Training.  A major WF XXI training concept is to provide  embedded training capability in
operational systems across the Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS).  Embedded training
includes, where appropriate and effective, embedded user assistance, embedded simulation capability,
embedded connections for attachment of appended training simulations and simulators, and systems
design allowing dual use of communication and instrumentation capability for both training and tactical use, and the use of system operating controls with appended/embedded training simulations.  Embedded training seeks to combine training capability and tactical capability into a single system, reducing the demand for non-system TADSS and non-system PM offices, and making most efficient use of Army resources.<p>

(c)  Live.  Large scale fielding of TWGSS/PGS and enhancements to the MILES family are
projected for the live environment. Home station instrumentation systems will need to interface with
and leverage capabilities provided by the new generations of warfighting systems and embedded training.  The next generation of target systems will provide greater fidelity with look back sensors, shoot back capabilities and better hit sensor feedback.<p>

          (d)  Virtual.  The Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (CATT) family of ADS simulators includes the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) for armored and mechanized forces.  The Engineer CATT (ENCATT), Fire Support CATT (FSCATT), Aviation CATT (AVCATT) and Air Defense CATT (ADCATT)
simulators, all developed to be fully interoperable with the CCTT, will permit the complete
combined arms team to operate in the Field Training Exercise/Situation Training Exercise
(FTX/STX) and Command Post Exercise (CPX) mode from platoon through brigade levels.  The
CATT family will operate on both Local Area Network (LAN) and WAN systems, is designed to be
DIS compliant for interoperability with other simulation families and environments, and can utilize
the DSI for multi-location exercises on demand.<p>

          (e)  Constructive.  The Warfighter Simulation (WARSIM) is under development to be
the single Army constructive simulation from battalion through echelons above corps.   Being
developed as DIS compliant in architecture, WARSIM will include the ability to link to live and
virtual simulations, as well as other DIS constructive simulations.  The Joint Simulation System
(JSIMS), under joint service program development, will provide a common architecture for joint
training exercises at multiple echelons spanning the tactical, operational and strategic levels of
conflict.  The ALSP will continue to be improved and expanded in the short term to link various
service simulations together for joint service training exercises.<p></menu></menu>
