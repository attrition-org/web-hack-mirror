<b>The Chief of Staff of the Army's vision for the 21st century Army is
&quot;a total force trained and ready to fight, serving our nation at home and abroad;  a strategic force capable of decisive victory, as the cornerstone of readiness, training remains the Army's most important peacetime mission.&quot;
<p>
   While the focus has changed, the Army's mission today remains much the same as it has been for many years.  We have worldwide commitments with missions ranging from Major Regional Conflicts (MRC) to peacekeeping, peace enforcement and humanitarian assistance.  Now, more than ever before,
the Army operates in joint, combined or coalition environments. To carry out these operations, the need and sharing of information to command and control today's battlefield is essential to success.  The impact of the surge in information age technology with its rapidly, spiralling growth is without equal in past military history.  To meet these and future needs, the Army must train the soldiers of today and tomorrow on how to survive on an ever increasing lethal, digital battlefield.
<p>   
   The challenges of 21st century, high technology warfare call upon us to redesign the force structure and assess how it should be equipped, armed, and trained to fight tomorrow's battles.  Using Joint Venture (JV), the Army is executing a series of advanced warfighting experiments and demonstrations to design the force of tomorrow: Force XXI.  As we create Force XXI, we must concurrently develop the training strategy to achieve its maximum potential.  WF XXI is the concept for total Army training in the 21st century.  WF XXI integrates the entire spectrum of Army training programs and provides a strategy to integrate ongoing initiatives into a coherent, integrated training system.  As the training component of JV, 
WF XXI focuses on the development of training strategies for Force XXI.  To ensure training is included in every phase of the Force XXI development, WF XXI will integrate the numerous on-going initiatives and future developmental efforts to produce a coherent, integrated training system for today's and tomorrow's trained and ready power projection Army.
<p>

<center><h3>MISSION</h3></center>

<p>
The mission of WF XXI is to develop a training strategy and a training system for individual through Joint Task Force (JTF) level using the best combination of live, virtual and constructive simulations and simulators to create the Synthetic Environment (SE) training battlefield. Implied in this task is to:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Publish a plan for the total Army to meet this strategy.
<p>
<li>Ensure leader development and the three training pillars (self development, institutional, and unit) are incorporated in the strategy.
<p>
<li>Ensure <a HREF="op-anx-e.htm">Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS)</a> enhance and/or supplement live training events.
<p>
<li>Integrate the Live, Virtual and Constructive environments into a seamless SE training battlefield.
<p>
<li>Automate Army training in accordance with Field Manual (FM) 25-100, Training the Force and FM 25-101, Battle Focused Training.
</ul>
<p>
<center><img src="graphics/3dbargra.gif" WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="13"></center><p>
<center><h3>ASSUMPTIONS</h3></center>

<p>
The WF XXI strategy is based on assumptions supporting JV and Force XXI objectives.  These assumptions are:
<ul>
<li>WF XXI will use the same standards and apply to the total Army, both Active and Reserve Components (AC/RC).  
<p>
<li>Collective training requirements determine institution and self development training.  The focus of WF XXI is on unit training. However, the concept fully integrates and guides institution and self development training.
<p>
<li>The Army's current training paradigm of balancing trainer selected, mission essential training tasks (Mission Essential Tasks List) against resources remains valid.
<p>
<li>Future systems will be designed to Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) standards and will be Defense Simulation Internet (DSI) compliant.
<p>
<li>Future resources will continue to be constrained  Investments in training must be methodical and incremental, there are no resources for redundant development or experimentation.
<p>
<li>The lessons learned and capabilities of existing technology must be shared by all to fully exploit the Army's training investments.
<p>
<li>Though not all technologies are known, future technologies and capabilities must be exploited for use by all.  We must manage the continual ongoing change of the information age to achieve the best
training for the force.   
</ul>
<p>

<center><h3>CONCEPT</h3></center>
<p><p>
To achieve the WF XXI vision, we must: (1) define a structured, Combined Arms Training Strategy (CATS) based, training development system for planning, execution, and assessment of training; (2) identify the three pillars of training; (3 )identify the five components of training;(4) integrate five components of training into a system, and (5) assign responsibility for action plans for the future development of Army training.
<p>
(1) Define a structured, CATS based, training development strategy
<p>
    The CATS are the foundation of the structured training development for WF XXI.  As the Army's over arching training architecture,  CATS are the framework for establishing Army training.  Current CATS provide doctrine based training strategies including events, gates, and training resource options for the institution or unit trainer and integrates training horizontally among levels of a type unit and vertically across the combined arms and services team.  Future CATS must guide training, combat, and material developers in development of future combat equipment and combat systems to support Force XXI and the Land Warfare University (LWU).  Inherit in this task is embedded training in all new systems and
the evelopment of <a HREF="op-anx-d.htm">Training Support Packages (TSP)</a>to support Force XXI.
<p>  
    In the future, CATS will be the foundation of the &quot;unit oriented&quot; training strategy used by the<a HREF="op-anx-c.htm">  Standard Army Training System (SATS).</a>  CATS and SATS will assist both AC and RC trainers in design training programs, determining unit readiness, planning for mobilization and developing training budgets.
<p>
    CATS provides direction on how the Army trains the force.  It provides standardized training requirements and resources to execute the training.  Under the purview of the CATS, proponent
LWU schools develop unit training strategies for tactical units at Corps level and below.  These strategies propose the frequency of annual training events to achieve desired levels of proficiency and
readiness to accomplish battle-focused METL requirements.  The proposals are prepared as matrices of training event menus correlated with unit levels and critical training gates.  CATS include prescriptive training tasks for the basic training requirements (e.g., gunnery, physical training, etc.) and descriptive training tasks for advanced training requirements (e.g., power projection, large unit tasks, etc.).  The matrices also identify the training resources (e.g., Combat and land, and Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS), including Tactical Engagement Simulations (TES) Training Systems Devices) required to support each proposed training event.  Current CATS are governed by AR 350-41 (Training in Units), TRADOC REG 350-35 (The Combined Arms Training Strategy), and TRADOC PAM 350-10 (Combined Arms Training Strategy Development).
<p>
    Today's training strategies, and funding trails, are based on input from each school-house proponent.  CATS are supported by a training resource management system consisting of master and
modernization plans for major training resources (e.g., Tactical Engagement System-Master Plan (TES-MP) training system, range modernization, and Combat Training Centers (CTC) master plans). 
Master plans such as the TES-MP, define the current baseline and forecast future resource requirements, while modernization plans align training resource requirements contained in the proponent developed future CATS with available resources.  Current CATS reflect the baseline and apply to the execution, budget, and program years.  Future strategies are influenced by projected threats, operational missions, weapons and training technologies, and budgetary guidelines.  
<p>
(2) The three pillars of training
<p>
    CATS support the three mutually supporting pillars of training: unit, institution, and self development.  Unit training, outlined in the WF XXI Campaign Plan, reflects the collective training effort and captures all of the institutional and self development training as supportive of the collective training task.   Future institution and self-development training effort is outlined in the WARRIOR XXI Plan.
<p>
    Unit training strategies are prepared by proponents in the form of current CATS describing how Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&amp;E) units train and identify those resources required to execute the training.  The strategies depict a fully supported annual training plan enabling a unit to maintain required combat readiness. The strategies consist of a soldiers matrix, a maneuver or collective matrix (depending on the type unit) and a gunnery matrix. The strategies are descriptive in nature and provide the foundation for the trainer to develop a training program. 
<p>
    The institutional pillars are developed by the proponent schools and define the requirements for training soldiers to standard in resident course instruction.  These Army courses span the gap from initial entry training of a new recruit to the Army War College for the Army's senior leaders.  Training at all levels focuses on the individuals development of basic skills and the development of future leaders.  The institutional pillar is connected to CATS by the proponent based training requirements or training strategies being directly reflected in the Programsof Instruction (POI) of each Army school.
<p>
    The self development strategies are designed by TRADOC through its proponent schools.  The strategies provide the soldier with a road map to improve his skills.  Currently, the Officer Foundation System (OFS) serves as the officers self development CATS for individual development and the Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) self development career map serves as the NCO self -development CATS.
<p>
(3) Identify the five components of training.
<p>
    The five components of the WF XXI Campaign plan are:  the Standard Army Training System (SATS); Training Support Packages (TSP); Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS);
<a HREF="op-anx-f.htm">Standard Army After Action Review System (STAARS)</a> and the <a HREF="op-anx-g.htm">Army Training Digital Library (ATDL).</a>
<p>
<ul TYPE="circle">
<li>    SATS,  the &quot;center of gravity&quot; of WF XXI, is the trainers management tool to provide a &quot;unit specific&quot; situational training template and aid in the management of training resources.  SATS implements the Army training policy described in FM, 25-100 (Battle Focused Training) and is based on CATS as described in TRADOC Regulation  350-35, (The Combined Arms Training strategy).  SATS is designed to save the trainer time and manpower and offers both structured and descriptive training guidance.  Additionally, SATS provides the training resource manager a tool to capture usage and cost of training resources for use in budgeting, management and programming of training resources.
<p>
<li>    TSPs are doctrinal training templates offering the trainer a total training package to execute training to achieve specific training objectives as spelled out in Army Regulation 350-38, (Training Device Policy and Management).  The TSP combines maneuver/collective gunnery and soldier CATS matrixes (tables and exercises) to produce a unit situational training template.  An event generator uses the situational event template data to provide scenarios, conditions, standards and semi-automated forces to support training events in one environment or a combination of the live, virtual, or constructive training environments.  The TSP couples the training event template, the trainer's requirements,  with the training tools, Training Aids, Simulations, and Simulators (TADSS), required to conduct the actual training exercises.  In this manner,  TSP's provide the trainer with a series of progressive, performance oriented exercises (crawl, walk, and run theory) designed to gradually increase task proficiency.  TSP's by design give the trainer a tool to maximize the use of all training resources, while reducing the trainer's planning time for execution of unit training. 
<p>
<li>    TADSS offer the trainer a selection of  training tools to offset the financial, safety, nvironmental/ecological, and technological constraints associated with today and tomorrow's training.  TADSS are broken into three environments; live, virtual, and constructive.  In the near future, the Synthetic Theater Of War (STOW) will link all three environments into a Synthetic Environment (SE)  training
battlefield that can be used to train or conduct mission rehearsals on the battlefields of tomorrow.  In the future, TADSS will be Distributed Interactive Simulations (DIS) compatible; Defense Simulation Internet (DSI) compliant; use standard terrain, enemy, and icon data bases; be fully embedded in equipment and systems; and be fully integrated into the total Army system.
<p>
<li> STAARS standardizes all current and future after action review systems to provide the trainer, training developer, and combat developer with DTLOMS based information and feedback on performance of systems, students, and units.  It also provides the training resource manager with usage rates and operating costs of all training resources.  In the future, STAARS will automate the lessons learned system to provide all soldiers and units access to lessons learned from the CTCs, on going Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW), and/or combat operations.  The data from current STAARS systems provided from the live, virtual, and constructive environments, must standardized and synchronized to provide universal assessment of today's training proficiency, unit readiness, lessons learned and resource management.  Future STAARS will use DSI as the Army's information highway to feed information to the ATDL, for users to access.
<p>
<li> The Army Training Digital library (ATDL)  is the information foundation of WF XXI and is a repository of all training related information.  The ATDL will use the Army Training Information Management Program (ATIMP) as the interactive electronic &quot;library without walls&quot; for trainers, training developers, combat developers and resource managers.  Within the ATIMP, the Training Module (TRAMOD) Executive Management Information System (TEXMIS) will have both internal and external digitized access to training information and other army system information supporting or relating to training.  Doctrine, ARTEP's, STP's, OFS, CATS and etc., coupled to unit logistic and personnel information, will be the future foundation of information for the SATS data base.  
</ul>

<p>
(4) Integrate five components of training into a system
 <p>
 When integrated with the three pillars of training and the structured training development system, the five components of WF XXI form a total, self sustaining , automated, training management system.  The trainer of the future will use an integrated training management support system to help optimize available training resources as he budgets, plans, prepares, and assesses the execution of this training.
<p>
Like today, the trainer of the future will derive a training plan from an assessment of the unit's training proficiency on its Mission Essential Task List (METL),  guidance from higher headquarters and
the automated quarterly training brief, and availability of training resources.  Future automated training management tools will provide the trainer the ability to integrate the guidance and his METL into
objective oriented, structured  training events to enable his soldiers to first conquer the basic tasks and then move, through a series of exercises and successes at critical training gates, to progressively
more difficult advanced tasks.  Using the training management database, available resources and the trainer's priorities, the SATS program will consider how best to train the unit and present the trainer with a selection of training program options for a decision or further prioritization.  Using the resource roll up and the multi-echelon training plans generated by SATS, the trainer makes the final adjustments to his training program before SATS publishes a training calendar and locks in the required training resources.  
<p>
 In designing the unit training program, SATS uses CATS and an automated task database stored in the ATDL based on unit Mission Training Plans (MTP) to integrate horizontally and vertically across the Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS).  This database provides a complete directory of critical combat functions for integration into the unit training plan.  This database is designed to evolve continually
based on the lessons learned from CTC Observer Controllers (O/C), doctrinal proponent changes from analyzing automated unit training feedback systems and lessons learned from deployed forces.
<p>
The Interactive Training Event Menu (ITEM) implements emerging technology to merge maneuver/collective, gunnery and soldier CATS matrixes to replicate combat conditions.  Based on the
trainer's input to SATS, ITEM selects the best mix or combination of the available live, virtual, and constructive environment resources and recommends event templates and models for a sequence of
training events.  Next, the training event model generates unit and threat systems, scenarios, environments, and Semi Automated Forces (SAF) for unit training and provides the information back to
SATS to request the required training resources to support the plan. Using SATS the trainer can adjust any of the variables to better meet his training requirement throughout the process.  
<p>
 The final piece of the training event model is the STAARS.  Throughout each training event, the unit's performance is automatically assessed against the trainer's structured training objectives using Army standardized, automated MTP training evaluation outlines in the task database stored in the ATDL.  Unit
gunnery performance captured during the exercise and O/C input provide additional feedback to the trainer.  The automated assessment tools allow the trainer to replay key portions of the training event or change scenario characteristics using the event generator to increase or decrease the intensity of the training environment during the event or for future exercises.   
<p>
Using the automated assessment tool, the trainer can automatically update his unit training status.  Transparently, the system tracks unit success and weakness as part of the data studied for upgrades of the task database, doctrine, and Tactics, Techniques &amp; Procedures (TTP) manuals.  Training resource usage and costs are also compiled for the trainer to use in his future training planning and for capturing total training cost to help program training requirements.
<p>
 Since the institutional and self-development pillars of training are tailored to provide soldiers who can meet unit collective training requirements, the Warrior XXI Plan is prepared to compliment the WF XXI Campaign Plan.  The mission of Warrior XXI is to assess and implement investments in technology and installations to produce competent, confident soldiers and leaders in the 21st century.  The intent is to retain the essence of TRADOC in a nucleus of fewer, high technology schools organized as the LWU.  The LWU will leverage information age technology and use small group methodology to provide relevant training and leader development to challenge quality men and women to meet ever changing demands of the Army.
<p>
To move us from today's proponent based instruction to the high LWU of the 21st century, the WARRIOR XXI plan is comprised of three main efforts.
<ol>
<li>Design the LWU:  The design will consist of multiple colleges (e.g. combat, combat support, combat service support, and professional development) to train respective branches consistent
with Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) strategy
<p>
<li> Leader Development:  Develop new collective training strategies in coordination with the Army Science Board, who is tasked to determine which technologies the Army should invest in to
educate 21st century leaders.  
<p>
<li>Classroom XXI:  The classroom XXI concept will expand the use of current and future technology to support &quot;classrooms without walls&quot; and &quot;distance learning&quot; concepts for the Army's LWU of tomorrow.  Other characteristics of the classroom are:
</ol>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Enable training experiences in live and synthetic environments
<p>
<li>Teach doctrinal concepts
<p>
<li> Involve student in experiments of future concepts
<p>
<li> Include collective training
<p>
<li>Integrates the three pillars of training
<p>
<li>Provide student accessible electronic information archives
<p>
<li>Develop a communications link with other leaders, universities, and units
<p>
<li>Provide leader access to the institution
<p>
<li>Provide electronic mentorship     
<p>
<li>Distance Learning:  Distance learning is an army initiative to leverage print and multimedia training technologies to broaden students access to training, modernize functional and leader development training at proponent schools, and resolve training shortfalls identified by unit commanders.  The Army Long Range Training Plan (ALRTP) directs TRADOC to:
</ul>
<p>
<ul TYPE="circle"><ul TYPE="circle">
<li> Implement a distance learning program by moving portions of resident training from the schoolhouse to soldiers at home station.
<p>
<li> Use advanced technologies to teach more students with fewer instructors.
<p>
<li>Lower costs through reduced movement of personnel and equipment to training areas. 
<p>      
<li>Where it makes sense, automate the first phase of courses as a correspondence phase.
<p>
<li> Functional courses:  Eliminate redundant courses and over production in remaining courses.
</ul></ul>
<p>
     The linking units to institutions using the information highway establishes a two way transfer of information between the unit and individual training pillars.  Classroom XXI will &quot;plug in&quot; electronically
to on-going training and operations, for classroom examples, demonstrations or active participation in classes by students.  Students will be exposed to information age technology and new requirements for training will be identified.  New technologies will require new skills to call for and adjust fire, when all friendlies are looking at the same near real time representation of the digitized battlefield.  Resupply will be streamlined through this common picture of the battlefield, causing institutions to upgrade logistics
instruction to reflect reality.  The linkage of WF XXI to Classroom XXI will produce soldiers who are better qualified to meet the Army's needs.  Additionally, institutions are the key link to the continued education of Force XXI soldiers by providing dynamic, relevant self-development courses through a variety of electronic media for the soldiers of tomorrow.  Some examples are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>  Institutions establish basic simulation/automation skills
<p>
<li> Units, CTCs, and institutions integrally linked
 <p>          
<li> Virtual and constructive simulation supplement the institution's capstone live training
<p>           
<li> On line multimedia training courses
<p>
<li> Integration into real time simulation exercises over the information highway
<p>
</ul>
(4) Assign responsibility for development of:
<p>
 <ul TYPE="circle">
<li>  Component 1, SATS, must be emphasized to help design a more holistic software system to meet the needs of:  trainers in institutions and units, training resource managers, training developers and ombat developers.  The Army Training Support Command (ATSC) will lead this effort as the executive agent for the DA Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations (DCSOPS) who is the proponent for SATS.
<p>
<li>           Component 2, TSPs, to emplace TSP's ranging from squad/crew to corps level two layers of packages must be designed and integrated.  First, brigade and below TSPs will be designed and built by the Force XXI Training Program (FXXITP).   The second component will be lead by the TRADOC Training Development and Analysis Directorate (TDAD), with corps and division TSP development  will be lead by the Combined Arms Center (CAC) and the Force XXI Training Program (FXXITP) leading the brigade and below TSP effort.
<p>
<li>           Component 3, TADSS, must be fully embedded in future systems and must be seamless to the execution of training programs.  Component 3 will be lead by the National Simulation Center as the combat developer for DA DCSOPS who is the proponent for TADSS.  
<p>
<li>           Component 4, STAARS, must standardize and synchronize the collection of data by all future systems in support of training management, training assessment, training development, resource
management, training resource usage, budgeting and Army lessons learned.  Component 4 will be led by Deputy Chief of Staff, Training, (DCST).
<p>
<li>           Component 5, the ATDL, must fully digitize all the required training information and establish standards and protocols for storage and access of the data.  Information from current systems must be integrated to support training activities and meet the data requirements of the SATS.  Component 5 will be led by the ATSC as the executive agent for DA DCSOPS who is the proponent for ATIMP.
</ul>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION:</h3></center>

<p>

          The road ahead for the development of Army training is a rough one.  The continual decrement of resources forces us to design new paradigms, integrate stovepipe structures, and break old &quot;rice bowls&quot;
to form a systemized process to support Total Army training.  To be successful, we all must work together for the benefit of today's and tomorrow's soldier.  The cornerstone of our Army's success, both today and in the past, has been the high quality training of our soldiers and units, we must ensure the soldiers of the 21st century are able to maintain this standard.
