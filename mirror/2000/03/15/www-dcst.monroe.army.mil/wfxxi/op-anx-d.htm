1.  SITUATION:<p>
<menu>
            a.  Unit commanders and their staffs spend too much  time on preparation and not
enough time executing training.  Traditionally units spend three days to prepare for one
day of training.  Warfighter XXI Training Support Packages (WF TSP) will enable units
to spend one day preparing for three days of training.  WF TSP will provide
commanders at all levels with the products necessary to execute rigorous, structured,
combined arms training making use of a table based training methodology; &quot;gates,&quot;
which measure task proficiency as training progresses.  Additionally, WF TSP will
provide a means for trainers to gain training feedback which is evaluated against
measurable standards.  These automated training packages will make optimal use of
TADSS and live training in order to facilitate effective and efficient training.<p> 

  b.  The Army has traditionally defined Training Support Packages (TSP) as the
materials and instructions needed to plan, prepare and execute training.  They are
complete, stand alone training packages integrating the products/materials necessary
to train one or more critical tasks.  TSPs vary greatly in content depending on the
training environment, audience, available Training Aids, Devices, Simulators, and
Simulations (TADSS) and tasks.  They can range from a paper based set of lesson
plans used to execute classroom instruction to the myriad of materials, orders,
overlays, Observer/Controller (O/C) instructions, Opposing Force (OPFOR) cell,
computer hardware, and simulation based scenarios required to support a Battle
Command Training Program (BCTP) Warfighter Exercise.  WF TSPs are unique in
providing battle command/staff and unit training, in structured tables and gateways,
based on critical tasks, conditions, and standards to train and measure performance. <p>
  
  c.  The WF TSP is broken down into four components:  Scenario Overview,
Evaluator Materials, Training Unit Materials, and Opposing Forces Materials.  These
components may include the following:<p>

   d.  The Combined Arms Training Strategy (CATS) is the foundation of the structured
training development for WF XXI.  CATS provides the over-arching strategy for training
management, sets the direction for how  the force trains and identifies the best mix of
training resources (including TSPs) to execute the training.  Future CATS will be a true
&quot;Combined Arms&quot; strategy, integrated both horizontally across the battlefield operating
systems (BOS), and vertically  to echelon's higher and lower.   The Force XXI Training
Program (FXXITP) being executed by the Armor School has developed the prototype
armor and mechanized infantry CATS of the future.<p></menu> 

2.  MISSION:<p><menu>
  
  TRADOC develops and fields WF TSPs that unit trainers access via the
Standard Army Training System (SATS), and that support execution of collective
training within Force XXI Combined Arms Training Strategies (CATS), NLT December
1999.<p></menu>




3.  EXECUTION:<p><menu>

 
     a.  Desired End-State.  Trainers at all levels will access TSPs stored at the Army
Training Digital Library (ATDL) via an improved SATS network.  Improved SATS will 
provide the recommended training strategy for selected tasks based on the unit
assessment and the resources/TADSS available.  This will provide the commander the
flexibility to select and tailor the optimum unit training strategy.  The commander then
selects the TSP that best supports his training objectives.  The result is structured,
task-based training, using the most effective training method available for the task(s) to
be trained.   WF TSP will be incorporated into ATDL NLT Dec 99<p>

     b.  Concept of the Operation    As TRADOC's WFXXI executive agent, Battle
Command Training Directorate (BCTD) will ensure that all WF TSP products are
synchronized and compatible with all components of the Army Training Information
Management Program (See Annex E).  The WF TSP Master Plan is a three phased
operation consisting of : PHASE I :   Identification of WF TSP requirements ; Phase II :
The digitization of existing required TSPs; and Phase III:  The creation and sustainment
of new required WF TSPs. <p><menu>

  (1).  WF TSP provide the task based products (orders, overlays,
execution matrices, etc) to plan, prepare and execute battle command/staff (individual
through collective) and unit (collective) training.  WF TSPs may be organized into
structured tables and exercises similar to the training exercise matrix used by
armor/mechanized infantry crewman in the Unit Conduct of Fire Trainer (UCOFT).   An
initial proficiency level is established based on previous training experience and
demonstrated performance.  This level is set for the crew or unit to enter the training
event.<p>

 (2).  WF TSPs provide  &quot;crawl, walk, run&quot; methodology of training.  The
trainer's inputs to the Standard Army Training System (SATS) will encompass
individual and crew training records, resource availability Operating Tempo
(OPTEMPO), ammunition, training areas, fuel/petroleum, oil, lubricants (POL), training
guidance,  training priorities, and Mission Essential Task Lists (METL).  Based on this
input, SATS provides the trainer a recommended training program (situational training
template) and draws appropriate WF TSPs  from the library.  The trainer, then reviews
and/or modifies, as required, the training package to ensure the unit's  training needs
are met.<p>

(3).  The WF TSP also provides pre-exercise event generation
information.  This may consist of any, or all, of the products reflected in paragraph one
above.  This will streamline the training process by eliminating the need for extensive
preparation of support products.  The WF TSP will include a standard terrain database
(TDB), and semi-automated forces (SAF) with variable levels of conflict intensity.  The
unit executes the training using Army wide objective standards of performance and
evaluation included as an integral part of the WF TSP.<p>  

 (4).  The FXXITP at Fort Knox is the lead effort for WFXXI, the Army's
vision for training Force XXI.  FXXITP is focused on the mounted brigade and
represents a prototype strategy to  transition  the Army from the way it trains today to
how it will train in the future.  It increases the time the commander and staff spend
training by decreasing the time spent determining what and how to train.  It employs the
use of emerging technologies to turn the commander's assessment of the fighting
readiness of his unit into a training program.  FXXITP describes which tasks are to be
trained to a given standard using prescribed live, virtual and constructive simulations. 
It has pioneered development of structured individual and small group staff training in
the form of tables, and exercises based on detailed tasks, conditions, and standards
(TCS).  Demonstrations of &quot;a way&quot; of executing a set of tasks to standard can be used
to assist staffs in reaching a minimal level of proficiency.  Staff procedures can be
refined and sustained in unit designed exercises.  FXXITP incorporates innovative WF
TSPs , which include orders, over lays, scenarios, observer/controller instructions, etc.,
reinforced with an automated After Action Review (AAR) process.  Functional task
groupings, the results of an ongoing Army Research Institute (ARI) study, have been
instrumental in TSP development at Fort Knox: providing the task analysis and
description of training/operations activities required to execute effective simulations-
based training and provide the task-based linkages among echelons and BOS
(horizontal/vertical  integration).<p>    

 (5).  Milestones:    The following major milestones are projected over the
next several years:<p><menu>
