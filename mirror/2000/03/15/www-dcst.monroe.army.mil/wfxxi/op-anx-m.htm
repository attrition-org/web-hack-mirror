     If you are familiar with the INTERNET &quot;mailing lists,&quot; you already know what a list (or
reflector group) is.   Otherwise, a few words of explanation are in order.<p> 

     A list is a capability provided to users to send and receive messages to all other
individuals belonging to the list.  <p>

     The list, as currently set up, is not intended as a private way to send messages.  When
you send a message to the list everyone who subscribes to the list receives a copy.  This
means that you will still have to use PROFS, or E-Mail when the message is for only a few
recipients.<p>

     There are currently the following six lists devoted to WFXXI topics. One is a general
area and five are specific areas dealing with each component.  We plan to use these lists
to distribute information, and hope to eventually have a wide audience of military, civilian,
and contractor personnel linked together.<p><menu><menu>

          o  WFXXI (general area that is not component specific)<br>
          o  SATS<br>
          o  TSP  <br>
          o  TADSS<br>
          o  STAARS<br>
          o  ATDL<br></menu></menu>

     Joining one or more lists is painless and takes only a few minutes.  If you are a PROFS
user the following instructions apply: <p>  <menu>

     a.  Create a name in PROFS in CMSNAMES called JOINLIST using the address
listproc@sc.ist.ucf.edu <p>

     b.  Now you are ready to join any or all lists you want.  Recommend as a minimum you
join the general list, and any specific component you desire.   As an example, to join the
WFXXI general list, send a PROFS to CMSNAMES(JOINLIST) with the subject line  blank,
and the following one line message (substituting your name in place of John Doe):<p><menu>

          Subscribe ARMY-WFXXI John Doe</menu><p>

     c.  The procedure is the same to join the other lists except you add the list you are
joining (such as SATS) with a dash after WFXXI.<p><menu>
          
          Subscribe ARMY-WFXXI-SATS John Doe<p></menu>

    d.  One key point you need to keep in mind is to send a separate message for each list
you are joining.<p>            

     e.  After joining the lists you need to create a separate name in your CMSNAMES to
reflect the different lists you have joined.  As an example, you might add the name
GENERAL to indicate WFXXI general list and another called SATSLIST to indicate your
SATS list.  You would add the following two entries to CMSNAMES:<p><menu>

     ARMY-WFXXI@sc.ist.ucf.edu  (This is under GENERAL)<p>

     ARMY-WFXXI-SATS@sc.ist.ucf.edu   (This is under SATSLIST)<p></menu>

     f.  Usually within a day you will receive conformation from the system administrator that
you are a member of whatever lists you subscribed to, along with some general
information. Once this has happened you are ready to send messages.  Remember to use
the appropriate CMSNAMES address you created when sending to the list, and remember
this is public traffic, not private.<p></menu>


     For those using E-Mail through other than the PROFS media the following applies:<p><menu>

     a.  Send a one line message to listproc@sc.ist.ucf.edu with the subject line left blank,
and the following  information(substituting your name in place of John Doe):<p><menu>

               Subscribe ARMY-WFXXI John Doe<p></menu>

     b.  The procedure is the same for the other lists except you add the list you are joining
(such as SATS) with a dash after WFXXI.<p><menu>
          
          Subscribe ARMY-WFXXI-SATS John Doe<p></menu>


     You will automatically receive all mail sent to the list(s) you have joined. To send
messages for general dissemination to subscribers use the following addresses:<p><menu>

         (General) - - - ARMY-WFXXI@sc.ist.ucf.edu <p>
          (SATS) - - - - ARMY-WFXXI-SATS@sc.ist.ucf.edu  <p>
          (TSP) - - - - - ARMY-WFXXI-TSP@sc.ist.ucf.edu <p>
          (TADSS) - - - ARMY-WFXXI-TADSS@sc.ist.ucf.edu <p>
          (STAARS) - - ARMY-WFXXI-STAARS@sc.ist.ucf.edu <p>
          (ATDL) - - - - -ARMY-WFXXI-ATDL@sc.ist.ucf.edu </menu></menu>
