Introduction<p>

1-1. Purpose. This pamphlet provides the U.S. Army an operational concept for the development and implementation of embedded training. Embedded training will ultimately allow commanders to deploy with their full training capability, but without the need to ship and store large containers of separate training aids, devices, simulations and simulators (TADSS). This is one of the key initiatives of Warfighter XXI (WF XXI), which is the lead component of the training axis for the 21st Century Army (Force XXI).<p>

Embedded Training<br>
Embedded Training is a capability built into or added onto operational equipment and systems.  It enables training delivery to soldiers using their own equipment while in the field or at home station.<p> 

Chapter 2<br>
Overview<p> 

2-1. Introduction<p> <menu>

	a. On 3 March 1987, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, General Maxwell Thurman, and the Under Secretary of the Army, the Honorable James Ambrose, signed a memorandum defining Embedded Training (ET).  It also established ET as the preferred method for training device strategies. In June 1995, the DCSOPS of the Army recognized that providing an embedded training capability is one of the  key training concepts for Force XXI.<p>

	b. Warfighter XXI, the unit training and training management axis of Army Training XXI, incorporates embedded training as one of its requirements for the future of training development.  The goal is that future TADSS will be fully embedded and interoperable with an overarching Common Operating Environment (COE).  This 21st Century Army will leverage technology to link geographically separated units in live, virtual and constructive simulation training to sustain a trained and combat ready force.  It will reduce the cost of training to standard by maximizing the utility of scarce resources such as limited terrain, fuel, ammunition and time.<p></menu>

2-2. Future Training.<p><menu>

	a. Force XXI, the 21st Century Army, will be an information age force that will leverage emerging technologies to quickly respond to commanders&#146; needs for information to win battles.  To take advantage of this, the Army will field systems that will be ever more complex and require more intensive sustainment training to prevent skill decay.<p> 

	b. Warfighter XXI will radically change the way the Army trains.  It will completely reverse the planning to training time ratio. Instead of three hours of preparation for every hour of training, it will gradually become one hour of preparation for every three hours of training. It will give commanders the ability to integrate all the separate components of training into a cohesive training strategy.  Among the technological training solutions envisioned by Warfighter XXI are the Synthetic Theater of War (STOW), a synthetic environment that allows units in various locations to train together in a live, virtual and/or constructive simulation environment; embedded training; and digitized systems that greatly enhance the soldier&#146;s ability to maintain situational awareness.</menu><p>

2-3. Assumptions.  The requirement for embedded training capabilities is based on several assumptions about the 21st Century Army.<p><menu>

	a. Embedded training capabilities will support training, training management and leader development for Force XXI.<p>

	b. Leaps in technology will allow Army combat, training and materiel developers to plan for future embedded training capabilities that may not be technologically feasible now.<p>

	c. The Force XXI concept of a CONUS-based, power projection Army will require deployable training, mission rehearsal and course of action development capabilities.<p>

	d. Environmental, political and resource constraints will limit large scale exercises to a few select areas.<p>

	e. National Military Strategy and the Department of Defense (DoD) must focus on the full spectrum of military operations.  It will require the DoD to plan for contingencies in many new regions. All this will make training and rehearsal more complex, thus requiring technological solutions to facilitate training regardless of the soldiers&#146; location.<p>

	f. The Army Technical Architecture&#146;s (ATA) series of Common Operating Environments (COEs) will define requirements for interoperability of operational systems and models &amp; simulations.<p>

	g. The five components of Warfighter XXI will frame the Army&#146;s training development and training management for the 21st Century Army.  The five components are: The Standard Army Training System (SATS); Training Support Packages (TSP); Training Aids, Devices, Simulations and Simulators (TADSS), Standard Army After Action Review System (STAARS), and the Army Training Digital Library (ATDL).<p>

	h. Training in extreme climatic conditions, inaccessible terrain, and Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) contaminated areas can be accomplished safely in a synthetic environment (SE)<p></menu>

2-4. Required Capability.  The concept of embedding training in operational systems achieves several capabilities that are key to Force XXI.<p><menu>

	a. Total System Development.  The goal of equipping the Army to be a trained and combat ready force requires that system developers plan for realistic training and mission rehearsal capabilities.  System developers must plan for the total integration of the embedded training concept to allow for operation of the prime system in concert with the training system where materiel solutions allow.  Embedded training accessibility must be nearly instantaneous to maximize training realism.  This will reduce redundant development, procurement and logistical support costs.  It will also eliminate overlapping requirements that have emerged from past &#147;stovepipe&#148; management processes.<p>

	b. Mobility and Deployability of TADSS.  The requirement for new training systems must specify the need for fully embedded training capabilities.  When stand-alone or appended items are required they must be sufficiently transportable to support deployed forces.  Full consideration must be given to size, weight, packaging, configuration, environmental needs and supportability.</menu><p>



Chapter 3<br>
Concept<p>

3-1. Embedded Training.<br>
Embedded training is the ability to train a task using the associated operational system.  It will not adversely impact the operational capabilities of the system.  Embedded training requirements must be identified as an essential operational capability of the system in the Concept Exploration phase of development.  It includes embedded user assistance (help); embedded simulation, emulation or stimulation capability; embedded connections between the prime system and the training system; and training instrumentation.   Embedded training includes system design that allows dual use of communication and instrumentation capability for training and tactical use and the use of system operating controls with appended/embedded training simulations.  To the greatest extent possible, it must be able to use operational data stored in the prime system as well as upload data specific to the training event.  It can also provide a mechanism for interactive access, feedback, storage and dissemination of lessons learned as they occur.<p>

3-2. Categories of Embedded Training.<br>
There are four embedded training categories based on the level of training to be fulfilled. They are aligned along the training spectrum from individual to collective.<p><menu>

	a.  Category A: Individual/Operator.  The objective of Category A is to train and sustain individual operator and maintenance task skills. <p>

	b.  Category B: Crew/Team.  Category B's objective is to train and sustain combat ready crews and teams.  This category builds on individual skills acquired from Category A. <p>

	c.  Category C: Functional.  The objective of Category C is to train and sustain commanders, staffs, and crews/teams within each functional area to be utilized within their operational role. <p>

	d.  Category D: Force Level/Combined Arms and Battle Staff.  Category D's objective is to train and sustain combat ready commanders and battle staffs utilizing the operational system in its operational role.<p></menu>


3-3. Methods of Embedded Training.<br>
There are three methods for building embedded training technology into systems.<p><menu>

	a.  Fully embedded.  All embedded training features are built into the primary system.  In this case, the embedded capability is distributed with the prime system on a one-for-one basis.  The requirement must be stated as an essential operational characteristic of the system by the combat and training developers.  Embedded training capabilities impact the system&#146;s concept formulation package (CFP) and cost assessment.  In addition, ET must be included in the operations and mission profile used to develop Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM) requirements.<p>

	b.  Appended.  The embedded training system is installed or attached to the primary system when needed, and removed when not needed. It is likely to require that the operational system have permanent, designed-in components such as sensors, power source adapters, connectors, or mounting brackets.<p>

	c.  Umbilical.  Like appended, umbilical is attached to the prime system when needed, and removed when not needed.  It involves additional physical connections to external components such as computers, instructor/trainer consoles, Local Area Networks (LAN), and long-haul digital circuits.  It often connects many systems, as in the use of Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) used as the interface with constructive simulations.</menu><p>

3-4.  Embedding Training in Operational Systems.<br>
Embedded training can be implemented in four broad categories of systems as defined in the ATA version 4.X.  They are Sustaining Base and Office Automation, C3I, Weapons Systems, and Models &amp; Simulations.  Each category is a Common Operating Environment (COE) domain and will be interoperable with the other domains as part of the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) COE.<p><menu>

	a. Sustaining Base and Office Automation.  In this case, embedded training is primarily aimed at individual training.  The user will be able to use fully embedded coaches and performance support systems (PSS) for training during operations.  He can also use appended training using temporarily loaded or by temporarily running a training capability from a CD ROM.  The user can also train using the system in an umbilical mode when training on-line with another networked user, or when accessing training information through the Army Training Digital Library when it is fully functional. <p> 

	b. C3I and Support Systems. The ABCS system of systems is one area that can take advantage of embedded training capabilities.  By designing system software that uses artificial intelligence to coach users in correct ways or even better ways to use the system, the individual embedded training can greatly reduce initial and sustainment training requirements.  For team, functional crew/staff, and force level commanders and staffs, the C3I and support systems can train in a combination of appended and umbilical training with the ABCS systems linked to each other on a network and to a scaleable future simulation through the synthetic environment (SE).<p>

	c. Weapons Systems.  Embedded training in weapons systems will consist primarily of individual and crew/team training.  This includes visual and audio cues that will shorten the initial and sustainment training time required.  It also includes embedded simulators that can train some or most of the critical tasks for that weapon system.  In some cases it will also include embedded links to the other domains such as a tank that has an embedded simulation capability that can link through a digital communications architecture to a C3I system.<p>

	d. Models and Simulations.  Models and simulations support the training capabilities of the soldiers using systems from the other three domains.  There are primarily two ways they will accomplish this, in order of preference:<p><menu>

	   (1) Embedded Simulations. In many sustaining base, C3I and weapon systems, rapid leaps in technological capabilities will allow system developers to embed some simulator capability into weapons systems and to embed some simulation capability in sustaining base and C3I systems to allow students and operational staffs to train and rehearse locally.<p>

	   (2) Stand-alone Simulations.  Future simulations will be accessible on demand by commanders who want to train and/or rehearse their units using sustaining base automation, C3I systems, or weapons systems linked through the synthetic environment.  This can be simply on a single post or with units spread across thousands of miles.<p></menu></menu>



Chapter 4<br>
Implications<p>

4-1. Doctrine.  Doctrine is rapidly changing to accommodate the future power-projection Army of Force XXI. The Army will be an information age force that will leverage technology to solve training challenges.  This will include an embedded capability to rehearse complex missions and &#147;wargame&#148; courses of action.  This embedded training capability will be able to access the latest digitized Army doctrine through the internet to maximize training effectiveness.<p>

4-2. Training.  Training in the information age force will be complex and varied.  It will include mission rehearsal capabilities that will integrate the varied elements of the digitized systems on the battlefield.  With the fielding of greater numbers of embedded training systems and the ever-increasing availability of distance learning, soldiers will have greater access to their training tools.  This will maximize soldier proficiency by transforming the work environment into a training environment.<p>

4-3. Leader development.  Leader development instruction will prepare Army leaders to understand and exploit the rapid growth in technological advances that will allow system developers to incorporate embedded training.  It will prepare leaders to plan and execute creative solutions to training challenges without the constraints from availability of TADSS or training areas.<p>

4-4. Organizations.  As with the Army as a whole, embedded training and the technological advances that will accompany it will create opportunities for change in the current training-related organizations.  Directorates and staffs that are built around a paper-based, separate training device strategy will be replaced by smaller organizations that will support the electronic flow of training capabilities and training information.  Organizations that are involved with fielding separate and stand-alone training devices will gradually be able to focus their scarce resources such as people, time and funding to other missions. The organizations involved with fielding operational systems will take on greater responsibility for the training on those systems.<p>  

4-5. Materiel.  The training developer for each system will be the Army&#146;s representative that initially identifies embedded training requirements during the concept development phase of the Life Cycle System Management Model (LCSMM).<p><menu>

	a. System Development. An embedded training capability that can be deployed with operational systems will allow the Army to reduce development, procurement and logistical support costs and eliminate overlapping requirements while increasing training capabilities and availability.  Army Program Executive Offices (PEO), Program Managers and Project Managers (PM) will plan, program and resource materiel training solutions as part of the operational system for which they are responsible.  This will require system developers to include the training time in calculating the system&#146;s reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM).  The end result will be that there will be no disconnect between the development of a system and the development of training capability for that system. <p>

	b. Information Architecture.  To fully exploit the capabilities of embedded training, the Army will  continue to aggressively pursue the goal of establishing an overarching COE to allow sustaining base automation, C3I systems, weapons systems, and models and simulations to interoperate in an on-demand synthetic training environment.  To ensure the information architecture grows with its support requirements, PEOs and PMs will consider data bandwidth requirements when deciding on which method of ET to use with their system.<p></menu>

4-6. Soldiers.  An embedded training capability will allow soldiers, crews, commanders and staffs at all levels to sustain their combat skills any time their operational equipment is available.  When combined with a STOW capability, soldiers will be able to link with soldiers using systems at different locations for training, mission rehearsal and course of action development.  All this will depend heavily on the ability of soldiers and leaders to quickly acquire skills in many technology-oriented fields, including networking.<p>

Annex A - Terms and Abbreviations<br>

Section I - Terms<p>

 Army Training Digital Library (ATDL). A gateway system to provide storage, retrieval, search and relational data for training data.  The ATDL is an integral part of the Warfighter XXI training strategy.<p>

Appended. <br> 
Embedded training that is installed or attached to the prime system when needed, and removed when not needed.  It is likely to require permanent, designed-in components (sensors, mounting brackets, connectors, etc.).  It could be used in assembly areas or in close proximity to combat.  It could go to war with the system, if designed to do so, but in many cases this is not a required capability.  Ruggedization may be required.  Systems of this type could be used with more than one prime system of the  same type, but only one at any given time.<p>

Category A Embedded Training (Individual/Operator).  Training objective:  Attain and sustain individual, maintenance, and system orientation skills.<p>

Category B Embedded Training (Crew/Team).  Training objective:  Sustain combat ready crews/teams.  This category integrates individual skills acquired from Category A.<p>

Category C Embedded Training (Functional).  Training objective:  Train or sustain commanders, staffs, and crews within each Battlefield Functional Area (BFA) to be utilized in their operational role.<p>

Category D Embedded Training (Force Level/Combined Arms and Battle Staff).  Training objective:  To train or sustain combat ready commanders and battle staffs utilizing the operational system in its combat role. <p> 

Combined Arms Training Strategies (CATS). The Army&#146;s overarching strategy for the current and future training of the force.  This strategy describes how the Army will train the total force to standard in the institutions and unit through self development.  CATS also documents the quantity, and justification for all training resources required to execute the training.<p>

Command, Control, Communication, Intelligence (C3I).   C3I will prepare decision makers for periods of crisis and war through simulations.  With the extensive computing and data base resources available, a commander can consider a wider range of options - and review &quot;war games&quot; of those options - prior to execution on the battlefield.  This will enable the commander to respond effectively and efficiently to new opportunities.<p>

Constructive. (1)  Mathematical models used as a tool to support collective training (battalion commanders and staffs through Army theater - CBS, CSSTSS, BBS) and in individual leadership training (JANUS) and analytical applications (JANUS and EAGLE).  May be used with or without human interaction.. Sometimes referred to as Wargame models. (DIS Master Plan, Sep 94). (2)  A form of M&amp;S that involves aggregated software representation of units, their behavior, associated outcomes, and support operations using rules, data and procedures designed to depict an actual or real world situation. (Army M&amp;S Master Plan).<p>

Courseware. An actual instructional package (including content and technique) loaded in a computer, training device, or other instructional delivery system. <p>

Embedded Training (ET).  A system training capability that enhances or maintains skill proficiency by allowing soldiers to train using their operational equipment.<p>

Fully Embedded.  A method of embedded training in which all features are contained in the prime system.  ET is distributed with the prime system, usually on a one-for-one basis.  It should be included when computing the Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM) requirements of the prime system.<p>

Instrumentation.  The use of electronic or electromechanical systems to sense and record events  performed by real weapon systems and personnel.  Instrumentation includes detection, measurement, recording, telemetry and data processing<p>.

Local Area Network (LAN).  A class of data networks which provides high data rate interconnection between network nodes in close physical proximity.  LANs are defined by the IEEE 802.X series of standards.<p>

Model  and Simulation (M&amp;S).  Any representation or imitation of reality.<p>

Operational Requirements Document (ORD).  A formatted statement containing performance (operational effectiveness and suitability) and related operational parameters for the proposed system.  The ORD will initially be prepared during Phase 0 &#147;Concept Exploration and Definition&#148;.  It will be updated during Phase I, &#147;Demonstration and Validation&#148;.<p>

Performance Support System (PSS).  PSS is a technology that helps users perform the operational task at hand.  This type of technology is also known as Electronic Performance Support Systems (EPSS), Knowledge Support Systems (KSS), and other similar titles.  PSS is &quot;operationally oriented&quot; training.  PSS does this by interpreting a user's proficiency and integrating diverse system resources to act together in a pseudo-interactive way with the user.  A PSS tailors information presentation and assistance to the user's proficiency, manner of learning, immediate needs, and stimulates learning at all times.  A PSS system combines technologies such as:  hypertext help, courseware, Graphic User Interface (GUI), icons, color and audio cues, and a utility to integrate them (i.e., Proficiency Recognition File (PRF)/algorithm, Intelligent Tutor System (ITS)/expert system, etc.).  Technologies selected for a PSS system is the quality of the integrating utility.  PSS technology primarily fulfills sustainment training needs and partially satisfies ET categories A, B, and sometimes C.<p>

Proponent. An Army organization or staff that has been assigned primary responsibility for materiel or subject matter experts in its area of interest.<p>

Simulation.  To feign., to obtain the essence of, without the reality of warfare.  In the DIS domains, everything short of actual combat is a simulation.  Three categories:<p><menu>

		Live.  A representation of military operations using military personnel and equipment which simulates experiences achieved during actual combat conditions.  Typical live simulations are operational testing, field exercises, training exercises and force-on-force exercises.  (DIS MP).<p>

		Virtual.  The environment created by physical models or simulations of weapons system, sets of weapons systems, or pieces of equipment which represent some major aspects of equipment operation.  Simulators interacting within a virtual reality environment and possibly with other simulators.  (DIS MP)<p>

		Constructive.  A form of simulation, commonly called war games, that involves software representation of two or more opposing forces, using rules, data, and procedures designed to depict an actual or real life simulation.  May be used with or without human interaction.<p></menu>

Simulator.  A training device which substitutes for, by emulation, the functions and environment of actual process, equipment, or systems.<p>

Standard Army Training System (SATS).	Standard Army Training System is a computer-based system that automates training management doctrine found in FM 25-100, Training the Force, FM 25-101, Battle Focused Training, and FM 100-5, Operations.  It provides the opportunity to incorporate training plans and products, readiness reporting tools, calendars (3 dimensional), schedules, all unit activities and related data bases at all echelons, and computes associated resources.  SATS accesses and feeds all library components as well as other Warfighter XXI (WF XXI) components.<p>

Standard Army After Action Review System (STAARS).  This system will standardize after action products by echelon .  AAR products will be identical or nearly identical for live, virtual or constructive exercises. STAARS will support training, rehearsal, analysis and research/experimentation.<p>

System Training Plan (STRAP).  The master training plan for a new system.  It outlines the development of the total training strategy for integrating the item into the sustaining base and gaining units; plans for all necessary training support, training products and courses; and sets milestones to ensure accomplishment of the training strategy.<p> 

Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS).  A general term that includes CTC and range instrumentation; Tactical Engagement System (TES); battle simulations; targetry; training unique ammunition; and dummy and  inert munitions. <p>

Training Support  Package (TSP) A package that provides a structured situational training template offering live, virtual, or constructive battle staff and collective training events to assist the commander in executing and assessing training.<p>

Umbilical.  This method of embedded training is like appended embedded training, but involves additional physical connection(s) to external components (computers, telephone systems, Local Area Network (LAN), etc.).  It may interconnect many systems, as in networked simulations for force-on-force training.  In most cases it is not a go-to-war training system. One umbilical system can serve multiple prime systems, or even dissimilar systems, and may support multiple systems at the same time.<p>  

Virtual.  Simulators interacting within a virtual reality environment and possibly with other simulators.  Operational examples are the M1 and M2 Conduct of Fire Training (COFT) found at various posts.  Future examples will be the Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (CATT).  (DIS Master Plan).<p>

WARSIM 2000 WARSIM 2000 will exploit new technology to enable command posts at all echelons to train in realistic, Distributed Interactive Simulation compliant, simulation environment.  The design will allow warfighting command posts to interact with the simulation using their TO&amp;E equipment so they can train in the field, not in simulation centers.<p>
