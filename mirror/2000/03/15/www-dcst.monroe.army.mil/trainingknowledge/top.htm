<P>
Almost every school/center has some pocket of innovative ideas
to conduct training and education either using classroom or distance
learning techiques. Some work on the Internet, some in the classroom.
We don't do well in publicizing these &quot;good ideas,&quot;
and we fail to use good stuff that's easily passed around. This
home page has been developed to publicize good ideas throughout
the training and education community.</P>
<P>
If anyone outside TRADOC has a good idea to make training/education
better, they should submit to the proponent school who will post
it under one of the below listed categories. Innovative ideas
will be accessible through the proponent schools or the listed
categories.</P>
<P>
<A href="indiv.HTM">Individual Training</A> <BR>
Training which prepares the soldier to perform specified duties
or tasks related to assigned duty position or subsequent duty
positions and skill level. </P>
<P>
<A href="collect.htm">Collective Training</A> <BR>
Training, either in institutions or units, that prepares cohesive
teams and units to accomplish their missions on the battlefield
and in operations other than war.</P>
<P>
<A href="self.htm">Self-Development Training</A> <BR>
Individual study by which a soldier learns or reinforces previous
learning, on his/her own. </P>
<P>
<A href="tngdev.htm">Training Development (TD)</A> <BR>
The Army's training development process is a systematic approach
to making collective, individual, and self-development training
decisions for the total Army. It determines whether or not training
is needed; what is trained; who gets the training; how, how well,
and where the training is presented; and the training support/resources
required to produce, distribute, implement, and evaluate those
products. The process involves five training related phases: analysis,
design, development, implementation, and evaluation. </P>
<P>
<A href="tadss.htm">Training Aids, Devices, Simulators, and Simulations (TADSS) </A>
<BR>
A general term that includes CTC and training range instrumentation;
Tactical Engagement System (TES); battle simulations; targetry;
training-unique ammunition; and dummy, drill, inert munitions,
casualty assessment systems, graphic training aids, and other
training support devices.. All of these are subject to the public
laws and regulatory guidance governing the acquisition of materiel.
</P>
<P>
<A href="tngtech.htm">Training Technology</A> <BR>
A term that includes hardware/software solutions and/or human
learning process solutions to training problems. Examples of hardware/software
training technologies include linked simulations, virtual reality,
artificial intelligence, embedded training, voice input/out devices
and global networks. An example of a human learning process training
technology may be an innovative way of designing a course to improve
performance. </P>
