<b>Introduction</b>   a.  The Army Distance Learning Plan defines and describes the    
               Army Distance Learning Program (ADLP).  This chapter provides    
               policy and guidance for execution and management of the program  
               within TRADOC.  The ADLP is designed to ensure and enhance the   
               readiness posture of the Total Army through the delivery of      
               standardized training to soldiers and units at the right place   
               and time using multiple delivery means and technologies.

<b>Non-resident</b>   e.  Figure 2 shows a notional example of this structure.  In     
<b>with</b>           this example, two non-resident phases are followed by a third    
<b>in-resident</b>    phase that includes both resident and non-resident modules.      
<b>module</b>         This structure may be desirable when there is a requirement to   
               bring students to a central location for hands-on training on    
               unique equipment or for a special training activity.             

                   The non-resident phases and modules include various          
               delivery media and exams.  The media are:                        

                Print

<b>In-residence</b>   f.  This structure provides opportunities for eligible students  
<b>with</b>           to accomplish certain cognitive learning objectives at home      
<b>non-resident</b>   stations before reporting to a location that offers courses      
<b>pre-course</b>     in-residence.  The structure offers the flexibility to provide   
<b>and</b>            follow-on training after students return home and gain           
<b>post-course</b>    on-the-job experience with newly acquired skills.  Figure 3      
<b>phases</b>         illustrates this structure.                                      

                   In this example, the pre-course non-resident phase includes  
               print-based and VTT-based modules.  It ends with a TE2 exam.     

                   The resident phase consists of modules that include          
               traditional instructor-controlled, student-centered              
               conferences; small-group instruction (SGI); VT presentations;    
               and ICW simulations.  The phase ends with a PE1 exercise and a   
               hardware-performance exam (TE1).                                 

                   The final phase is a combination of resident and             
               non-resident modules.  The in-residence module consists of a     
               demonstration (D) followed by a PE1 exercise.  The non-resident  
               module is a VTT presentation with a final TE2 exam.

<b>DL Course</b>     e.  The second step in the DL course selection process is to      
<b>Selection</b>     identify TATS courses that are appropriate for multimedia DL      
              course development.  The development of courses for DL requires   
              detailed training development analysis to determine the most      
              appropriate and cost-effective delivery method.  Media-selection  
              guidance is provided in the next section.  General guidelines     
              for determining if courses are appropriate for DL are as          
              follows:                                                          

<u>Training effectiveness</u>   Training that involves cognitive      
              skills has the greatest potential for  effective transfer of      
              knowledge via DL.  Psychomotor skills have a lesser potential;    
              however, since most courses consist of a combination of these     
              skills, effective training can usually be achieved through a mix  
              of presentation media.                                            

<u>DL eligibility.</u>  Certain courses are not eligible for DL due   
              to regulatory, safety, or other issues.  These courses include:   

               Initial entry training (IET) courses under 12 weeks, e.g.,       
              eight weeks basic combat training (BCT) and four weeks advanced   
              individual training (AIT) for non-prior service personnel.        
               Training which emphasizes safety and requires professional       
              supervision and certification, e.g., undergraduate pilot          
              training.                                                         
               Training conducted by the Army for other services.               

<u>Average daily student load</u>.  This factor relates to the     
               cost-effectiveness of DL development.  It is the average number  
               of students per day attending a particular course, based on the  
               annual number of classes, the number of students per class, and  
               the length of each class over the school year. As a general      
               rule, courses with average daily student loads of less than 15   
               are not cost-effective for DL because of the high cost-of-       
               development per student ratio.

<b>Delivery</b>      c.  Delivery media link the training developer and the student.   
<b>Media</b>         In a traditional classroom setting, the instructor fills the      
              role of the delivery medium.  He or she provides the linkage      
              between the training developer and the student to deliver         
              learning.  In DL settings, the instructor's role is more that of  
              a monitor, counselor, administrator, or supervisor.  Most         
              student work is self-directed, with guidance provided within the  
              medium itself.  Delivery media are constantly evolving as new     
              technologies emerge and instructional-delivery methods mature.    
              Delivery media currently used include:                            

                  Print (e.g., textbooks and programmed text).                  
                  CD-ROM delivered text.                                        
                  Interactive courseware (ICW), e.g., interactive CD-ROM,       
              interactive computer diskettes, and computer-based training       
              delivered via the Internet/Intranet.                              
                  Audio and videotapes.                                         
                  Video teletraining (includes an instructor in the             
              traditional role of delivering training, but to a                 
              geographically-dispersed audience).                               
                  Embedded training systems.

<b>Media</b>         d.  Several factors enter into the decision process for           
<b>Selection</b>     selecting the appropriate training delivery medium.               
<b>Guidelines</b>                                                                      
<u>Training effectiveness</u>.  As with the decision to develop a   
              course for DL, the first media-selection criterion must be the    
              effectiveness of the medium in delivering required training to    
              established performance standards.  Potential DL delivery media   
              must be analyzed against course terminal and enabling learning    
              objectives and task performance standards to determine if they    
              will achieve the desired learning outcomes.  There may not be     
              one <i>best</i> medium, but <i>all</i> media must pass through this             
              training-effectiveness gateway to qualify for further             
              consideration.                                                    

<u>Training site location and capabilities</u>.  This factor        
              addresses student demographics and distribution in relation to    
              established training sites.  Given this information, the type of  
              site(s) to which training will be delivered must be analyzed to   
              determine the capabilities available to receive and disseminate   
              training via various delivery media.  Figure 4 shows the          
              objective DL facilities and their capabilities.  Possible         
              facility sites include:                                           

                 TRADOC schools and centers.                                   
                 Other AC installations, training centers, and unit facilities.   
                 TASS/RC training institutions.                                   
                 ARNG armories.                                                   
                 Student living quarters.                                         
                 Universities and community colleges.                             

<u>Affordability</u>.  All other factors being equal, the           
              media-selection decision should focus on those media that         
              require the least investment in fidelity and student interaction  
              to achieve TLOs.  Other affordability issues include:             

               Equipment procurement costs.                                     
               Course development costs.                                        
               Course implementation/delivery costs.                            

<u>Budgetary limitations</u>.  The ADLP is a programming and        
              budgeting document which establishes resource levels required     
              for courseware redesign.  The costing model used for the Army     
              Distance Learning Plan is based on a media mix consisting of 60%  
              VTT, 30% interactive CD-ROM, and 10% print, VT, and other CBT.    
              Additionally, costs are based on the proponent schools            
              accomplishing the TD effort at in-house levels of 10% during      
              Fiscal Years (FY) 1998 through 2000, 20% during FY 2001 through   
              2003, and 30% thereafter.  The balance of the effort may be       
              accomplished with contractor support.  Based on these             
              parameters, proponent schools must complete the entire            
              courseware conversion requirement within funding allocations.
