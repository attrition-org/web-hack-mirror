                  aint Thomas More was born in London on February 7, probably 
                  in 1477, but perhaps in 1478. He studied at Oxford University 
                  and began his legal career in 1494, and became an under-sheriff 
                  of London in 1510. By 1518 he had entered the service of King 
                  Henry VIII as royal councilor and ambassador. He was knighted 
                  and made under-treasurer in 1521, and was chancellor of the 
                  Duchy of Lancaster from 1525 to 1529. </font></h3>
                <h3><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
                  <h3><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
                    <P>He became lord chancellor after Cardinal Wolsey was dismissed 
                      late in 1529. At that time, Henry VIII was engaged in a 
                      bitter battle with the Roman Catholic Church. He wanted 
                      to divorce Catherine of Aragon so he could marry Anne Boleyn. 
                      More resigned his office because he could not support the 
                      king's policy against the pope. In April, 1534, More was 
                      imprisoned for refusing to swear to the Oath of Supremacy, 
                      the preamble to a law called the Act of Succession. The 
                      oath stated that Henry VIII ranked above all foreign rulers, 
                      including the pope. More was convicted of high treason on 
                      perjured (falsely sworn) evidence and was beheaded outside 
                      the Tower of London on July 6, 1535. Thomas More has since 
                      become an example of the individual who places conscience 
                      above the claims of secular authority. It was because of 
                      these strong beliefs and his martyrdom that the Catholic 
                      Church declared him a saint in 1935. </P>
                    <P>More's personality combined intense concern for the problems 
                      of his day and spiritual detachment from worldly affairs. 
                      He was a devoted family man, and lived a plain, simple, 
                      private life. He was famed for his merry wit. Yet to the 
                      people of his day, More was a contradictory figure - merriest 
                      when he seemed saddest and saddest when he appeared most 
                      happy. He was also a patron of the arts. His friends included 
                      the humanist Erasmus and the artist Hans Holbein. </P>
                    <P>More's sympathetic philosophy is best reflected in Utopia 
                      (written in Latin in 1516). Utopia is an account of an ideal 
                      society, with justice and equality for all citizens. </P>
