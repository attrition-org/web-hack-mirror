                  is held for 2 hours a night, five nights a week, beginning on 
                  Sunday. At that time, students prepare their assignments for 
                  the next day's classes or work on long-term projects. The study

                  upperclassmen, to help fellow students with their homework.

                  to college, a student must have a solid background in English 
                  literature and composition, mathematics, and a broad exposure 
                  to history, foreign language, science, and the arts. Based on 
                  the results of the Stanford Test of Academic Skills, students 
                  enrolling in our program are generally lacking basic language 
                  arts and mathematics skills and the study habits necessary to 
                  achieve these skills. Our curriculum, designed around required 
                  courses desired by most colleges, enables a student to develop

                <h3>The daily schedule provides a structured environment in which 
                  the mind, body and spirit can flourish.</h3>
                <h3>The school day begins at Saint Thomas More School with optional 
                  attendance at morning mass. Breakfast is followed by room inspection.</h3>
                <h3>Classes and lunch take up the balance of the morning and early 
                  afternoon. The last period of the school day is followed by 
                  a special period when students may seek extra help with their 
                  studies.</h3>
                <h3>The afternoon is devoted to athletic programs in which all 
                  students must participate.</h3>
                <h3>Between the end of the class day, afternoon athletics and 
                  evening study hall, there is sufficient time for students to 
                  take part in extracurricular activities, visit the library, 
                  or converse with friends and advisors.</h3>
                <h3>Because they're taught to manage their time and energy efficiently, 
                  students generally find time for themselves - to write or call 
                  home, visit the school canteen for a snack or camaraderie, or 
                  take a quiet walk on campus to be alone with their thoughts.</h3>
                <h3>On weekends, our students enjoy leisure time, recreational 
                  activities, trips and dances that are held in conjunction with
                  girls' schools.</h3>
