<U>Master Facilities Plan Unveiled at Annual Alumni Awards Program</U>


<BR>
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
     November 12th, 1999 was truly a night of excitement.  James G. Kennedy '68 hosted our Annual Alumni Awards Dinner in the Heisman Room of the Downtown Athletic Club.  The STM family was out in full force for a night of socializing, dining, and honoring our own.  Alumni Association President Henry "Ric" Suzio '86 and actor and producer Mario Van Peebles '74 were recognized during the evenings program.  Suzio '86 was presented with the Alumni of the Year award for his great commitment to Saint Thomas More School.  Van Peebles '74, our keynote speaker for the evening, was given the Distinguished Alumni Award for his achievements in the entertainment industry.  Their love for, and appreciation of Saint Thomas More School was evident in both individuals heartfelt acceptance speeches.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
     Part of the nights excitement included the unveiling of Saint Thomas More School's 10-year, 16 million dollar Master Facilities Plan.  Headmaster James F. Hanrahan, Jr. '72 presented to those in attendance architects renderings of this ambitious project.  Ground is to be broken on a new Administration Building this Spring, signaling the start of the project. The new Administration Building will add much needed office and meeting spaces to the campus, include a new mailroom, and according the Mr. Hanrahan, Jr. '72 "will house a technology network center."   Those present at the New York event were truly energized about this exciting transformation of the STM campus.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
     "In order for this plan to succeed, we need you to partner with us," the Headmaster told the crowd.  Through the support and generosity of the STM family, this plan can, and will, become a reality!

<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
       Our gracious host James G. Kennedy '68, our deserving award winners Ric Suzio '86 and Mario Van Peebles '74, and the unveiling of the Master Facilities Plan, all made for a night to remember in New York City.
<BR>

<A NAME="spring">
<U>Spring Spree Days</U><BR>
May 12th-14th, 2000- Come join the fun at Saint Thomas More School's third annual Spring Spree Days.  A fabulous buffet at Foxwoods Resort Casino's Grand Pequot Tower, Chancellor sporting events, and activities for the children are just some of the things to look forward to during this alumni weekend. Alumni, parents, friends, and family of Saint Thomas More are encouraged to attend.  Don't miss the great time to be had by all at STM's third annual Spring Spree Days!<BR>
Details are to follow.  Make sure you save the dates!

<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="fund">
<U>The Saint Thomas More 1999-2000 Annual Fund</U><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
     In a constantly changing world, the enduring values and discipline learned at Saint Thomas More School have provided a grounding for young men for nearly four decades.  Faces on campus may change, but Saint Thomas More's mission remains the same: to educate the learner who had demonstrated evidence of intellectual ability, yet needs a structured environment to achieve academic success.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
     By supporting the Annual Fund, you do your part to perpetuate this goal.  Your gift strengthens academic programs, advances computer technology, enhances the library, and improves overall campus life.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
     Private schools have always relied upon the loyalty of parents, past parents, alumni, board members, and friends to advance the institution.  The Saint Thomas More Annual Fund was established to do just that.  Tuition alone does not cover the cost of operating a school; all donations are supplementary to tuition income.  The choice to attend a private-independent school- an institution which has the freedom to determine its own direction and maintain its own standards, is a choice that we have all made and we have all reaped the benefits.  Our families are  an important component in maintaining the high standards of Saint Thomas More School.  Please consider a contribution to the Saint Thomas More School Annual Fund. Your support does make a difference.
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="chair">
<U>Become a Class Agent Chair</U><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
     Attention alumni!  Saint Thomas More School is looking for individuals with leadership qualities to become Class Agent Chairs.  Class Agent Chairs or "CAC's" serve as ambassadors to promote the mission of the school. Working closely with the Alumni Office, Class Agent Chairs create a personal letter to go out to former classmates.  The Alumni Office edits, processes, and posts the letters.  The time commitment is minimal, but the return to STM is great. This is an excellent way to renew old ties, get in touch with old friends, and become involved with STM.  Our busy alumni will also appreciate the fact the time commitment is minimal!  From our inaugural graduating class in 1963 to our most recent graduating classes, our Class Agent Chairs span the decades.  If you would like to find out more about serving as a Class Agent Chair, please contact Director of Alumni and Public Relations MaryLou Gannotti at (860) 859-1900 ext. 149.

     Career Day, alumni lunches, an archive of STM, fishing tournaments, and various regional alumni events are just a few of the exciting plans of the Saint Thomas More Alumni Association.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
     Just a few years ago, a group of dedicated STM alumni began what were to be the initial meetings of The Saint Thomas More School Alumni Association.  Since that time, this group has elected leaders, helped to create our annual alumni weekend "Spring Spree Days," and has also seen the hiring of a full-time Alumni Director.  With these strides in mind, the association continues to chart its course for the future.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
     Every former student, staff, and faculty member who attended or worked at Saint Thomas More School are automatic members of the Alumni Association.  As alumni, you are encouraged to get involved.  Becoming active with the Saint Thomas More School Alumni Association is a great way to renew old ties, form new friendships, and stay connected to life on campus.
<BR>
<BR>
     If you are interested in attending an upcoming meeting of The Saint Thomas More Alumni Association, please contact MaryLou Gannotti at (860) 859-1900 ext. 149.  Your ideas, enthusiasm, and energy are welcome.
