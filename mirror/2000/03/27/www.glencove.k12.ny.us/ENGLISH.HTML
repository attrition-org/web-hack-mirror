<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The objective of any English course is to enable the student to reach his/her maximum potential in the areas of reading, writing, speaking, listening, and thinking.  Improvement in these areas of the subject is the criterion by which a student may be judged.  The mastery of English -- the ability to analyze and communicate effectively -- is the keystone for success scholastically, professionally, and socially.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">State requirements for graduation include passing the Regents Comprehensive Examination <U>or</U> the Regents Competency Tests in Reading <U>and</U> Writing.  (Regents Competency Tests will be eliminated in 1999, when <U>all</U> students must pass the Regents Examination.)  These examinations initially are offered in the junior year.  In addition, each student must successfully complete 4 years (8 semesters) of English in order to graduate. Supplemental English elective courses may be taken to complete the fifth year major (one of the State mandated options for graduation).  Courses taken prior to the senior year of high school will count toward elective credit only.</P>
