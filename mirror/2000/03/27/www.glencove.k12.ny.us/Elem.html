</b></font><p>Glen Cove's Elementary Program features age appropriate school environments.  Younger children (grades K-2) attend Deasy and Gribbin Schools, where programs and facilities are geared to the physical, emotional and educational needs of early childhood.  Children in grades three and four attend Connolly and Landing Schools, where the concentration of resources is suited to older elementary students.  The academic program is enriched by special cultural activities and computer assisted instruction in up-to-date computer labs.  Each school is also equipped with a reading lab, a gymnasium, a resource room, a lunchroom, a library and creative playground facilities.  District-wide services include breakfast and lunch programs, diagnostic screening, and psychological, speech and remedial services.  A pre-kindergarten program, based primarily on economic need, is free and is housed in Deasy Elementary School.  A gifted and talented program, called Academics Plus, is also available to third and fourth graders.  </p>
