<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The field of the Social Studies is almost limitless.  It is as wide as the world and as long as the history of humankind.  For good measure it includes the millions of years prior to recorded history and also the foreseeable future.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Social Studies includes material drawn from all the social sciences and related disciplines, including psychology, sociology, geography, anthropology, history, economics, political science and philosophy.  Nor does the area of the social studies end there.  It draws likewise from literature, science, art, music and religion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The subjects we offer are selected from these many fields in an effort to help social studies students focus on people, on the world, and on the relationships between the two.  In brief, the social studies are those instructional courses, programs and projects that are designed to assist students to understand, analyze, react to, and act upon the relationship of human beings to the world in which they live.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of the 9-12 social studies program, students should be able to:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.&#9;describe and analyze major historical factors in the development of the United States</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.&#9;demonstrate the skills that enable people to participate reasonably in a democratic society</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All students are required to successfully complete a minimum of four years of Social Studies.  In grades 9, l0, 11, and l2, alternate paths are provided by placement according to ability. Placement is reviewed periodically and students are reassigned when appropriate.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following ability level designation reflects specific academic and behavioral expectations in grades 9 through l2.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LEVEL-H</U>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate only for students who have demonstrated outstanding achievement in the social studies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>STATE TESTING PROGRAM</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Students who wish a Regents level diploma in the social studies must pass the Global Studies Regents at the end of the sophomore year and the American History Regents at the end of the eleventh grade.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those students who wish to graduate with a Glen Cove High School Diploma must pass a Global Studies Competency at the end of the sophomore year and an American History Competency at the end of the junior year.  Remediation will be provided for those students who fail the competency exams.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Department Philosophy</U>  A major purpose of the social studies curriculum is to encourage the growth of critical thinking skills in our students.  In order for them to master divergent thinking and writing skills, the student must experience and be taught the various components of these skills.  The format which we present is sequential and developmental in nature.  The successful completion of the program will enable the student to make outlines, write effective essays, understand inferences and develop valid generalizations.  In every year students will write a research paper.  It is important for the parent and student to note that this approach views the social studies as three separate but dependent components - content, concepts, and skills.  Each component is extremely important, but if taught in a vacuum, it becomes meaningless and insignificant.  Content must be perceived as a hierarchy, starting with simple recall information and ending with the student's judgments concerning that information.  All level students will be taught and evaluated with this approach in mind.  Simple recall questions are not the basis of a student's evaluation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In summary, it is the intent of the program that the learners will perceive their studies as information to think about and use, not merely observe and memorize.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>COURSE DESCRIPTION</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;GLOBAL STUDIES</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This two-year social studies program is designed to develop historical and cultural comprehension of various regions and nations outside of North America, of the connections among these, and between the nations and people studied and the United States.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The title "Global Studies" is used to stress the major theme that must be included in these two years.  The knowledge of the interdependent relationships is a key understanding which must emerge from the study.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Selected nations in Latin America, Africa, South and Southeast Asia, East Asia, the Middle East and Western and Eastern Europe are studied in a chronologically organized, thematic fashion.  In grade 9, students will study Latin America, Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and East Asia.  In grade 10, students will study the Middle East, Europe, and the Soviet Union.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;UNITED STATES HISTORY</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This one-year course is designed to provide students with a culminating survey of major forces of their national history.  A two-year American History course in grades 7 and 8 with an emphasis on the colonial and national periods provides the foundation for this year's work.  Experience with one-year courses which attempt to cover the entire scope of American History has shown that they seldom reach the period of 1945 to the present;  those courses that do get beyond 1945 are usually so abbreviated that the students obtain both erroneous impressions and interpretations of their heritage.  Further real evidence reveals that such surface surveys leave little time for examination of major ideas and forces affecting the students' lives.  This course is in keeping with the current recommendations to curtail the sweeping scope of history and offer greater concentration on larger ideas and themes and to provide for higher level critical thinking about these ideas and themes.  Major threads built into this course deal with significant Constitutional/legal issues, the industrial and technological development of United States society, and the increasing involvement of the United States in international and global concerns.  All three of these major ideas and themes are in accordance with stated goals of the Board of Regents.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;MANDATED ONE SEMESTER COURSES FOR SENIORS</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">219&nbsp;A.P.&nbsp;AMERICAN&nbsp;HISTORY</U>&nbsp;(AP)&nbsp;&nbsp;This course will allow juniors to develop disciplined work and study habits that will equip them to realize life long academic and professional objectives.  The A.P. program was designed to give more intensive instruction in college  preparatory work to the most able students and therefore enable them to make better use of their time in school.  (This course has been recognized by the S.E.D. as a viable alternative and substitute for the U.S. Government and History course offered to all other Juniors.)  1 Credit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">246&nbsp;INDEPENDENT STUDY</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a course for juniors and seniors who would like to make a further inquiry into the social studies at a more mature pace than in other courses.  There is a selected list of readings which provide an intellectual base around which the course is developed.  Classes will not meet every day.  A series of conferences will be scheduled with the teacher in order to channel the student's interest toward a specific area.  The course will then shift into the technique of developing a research paper.  This is a period of close collaboration between teacher and student.  The approval of the instructor and a certain curiosity about the past and the rest of the world is an obvious requirement for the course.  ½ Credit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
