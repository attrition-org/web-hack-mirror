<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Glen Cove has always been proud of our leadership in the use of computers in schools.  Students have been exposed to computers as tools in all phases of education.  The high school Computer Science department gives pupils the opportunity to delve into the workings of the computer.  Students find out how the machine was programmed to do all the wonderful things that they have been using.</P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">801&nbsp;INTRODUCTION&nbsp;TO&nbsp;COMPUTER&nbsp;PROGRAMMING</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a first course in computer programming.  Students will learn how to write logically structured, well documented computer programs.  The language that will be used in this course is LOGO Writer, a Pascal oriented language.&nbsp;&nbsp;½&nbsp;Credit.</P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">804&nbsp;APPLIED&nbsp;COMPUTING</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a project-oriented course open to all students.  Through the study of word processing, database management and electronic spreadsheets, the main focus of the course is how computers are used in real-life situations.  The second half of the course is devoted to a major project, which emphasizes the integration of all applications studied and culminates in a class presentation.  ½&nbsp;Credit.</P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">802&nbsp;BASIC&nbsp;PROGRAMMING&nbsp;I</U>&nbsp;(R)&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an algebraically oriented course in computer programming up to the concept of two dimensional arrays.  Students will learn how to write programs in BASIC and how to input and debug programs.  All programming will be done interactively through our computer network.&nbsp;&nbsp;½&nbsp;Credit.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prerequisite</U>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful completion of Seq. Math I or Introduction to Computer Programming. </P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">807&nbsp;BASIC&nbsp;PROGRAMMING&nbsp;II</U>&nbsp;(H)&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an advanced course in programming in BASIC.  Students will expand the skills obtained in Computer Programming I beginning with matrix instructions &amp; ending with string manipulation.&nbsp;<U>Prerequisite</U>: BASIC Programming I. ½ Credit.</P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">810&nbsp;HONORS&nbsp;COMPUTER&nbsp;SCIENCE</U>&nbsp;(H)&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a course designed for students who have demonstrated outstanding ability in the BASIC Programming courses.  The primary thrust will be the learning of Pascal, a structured programming language. Evaluation will be based on programming projects, tests and a final exam.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prerequisite</U>:  BASIC Programming II and Sequential Math II.  1 Credit.</P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">814&nbsp;AP&nbsp;COMPUTER&nbsp;SCIENCE</U>&nbsp;(AP)&nbsp;&nbsp;As a computer science course taught at a college level, this course is appropriate for students who have demonstrated outstanding achievement in the past.  The major emphasis will be on programming methodology, algorithms, and data structures.  The specific language used will be C++.  Students will be expected to devote a significant amount of independent time working on programming assignments.  Evaluation will be based on programming projects, tests, and a final project.  This is a full year course designed to prepare students for the AP Computer Science A exam.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prerequisite</U>:  BASIC Programming II and Sequential Math II.  1 Credit.</P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">820&nbsp;ADVANCED&nbsp;COMPUTER&nbsp;SCIENCE</U>&nbsp;(H)&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an independent study course for students who have demonstrated a high degree of proficiency in computer programming.  Students will be working on their own on one or more of the following: generating and maintaining data bases or a computer related project of their own choosing. Grades are pass/fail. Prior approval is necessary. </P>
