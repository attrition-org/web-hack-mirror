<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>As we ready ourselves for the year 2000, it is time to realize the changes that education has gone through. The days of &quot;the 3-R's&quot; are over. So too, are the old-fashioned &quot;gym&quot; classes that most feared, but make entertaining television.</p>
<p>We here in Finley Physical Education provide the children with a fitness-based program, that offers each and every student a chance to achieve and improve in a variety of activities.</p>
<p>To better acquaint yourself with the Physical Education Program, we offer you this overview of our procedures and policies.</p>
<b><p>GRADING:</p>
</b><p>The Physical Education Grade is based on the following criteria: Preparation, Participation, Quarterly Assignments, Skill Assessment, and Extra Credit.</p>

<ul>
<b><li>Preparation: <br>
Sneakers: </b>Required for all students. For your child's safety, platform or heeled sneakers are not recommended. Rubber-soled shoes or boots are <u>not</u> acceptable. <br>
<b>Clothing:</b> 6th, 7th and 8th graders are required to wear shorts or sweat pants, tee shirt or sweatshirt. 5th graders are asked to wear comfortable clothing. Overly baggy or excessively tight clothes are not recommended. </li>
<b><li>Participation: </b>All units are designed to challenge both the beginner and advanced student. Therefore, each student is required to participate at a level that fits the individual. </li>
<b><li>Quarterly Assignments:</b> All students will be given assignments that deal with the units being instructed. Quizzes, tests, reports and homework will be given with each unit. </li>
<b><li>Skill Assessment:</b> All students will be assessed on the skills taught in a unit. Assessments on the student's skill will be made by the teacher, the student, and his peers. </li>
<b><li>Extra Credit:</b> Students are given the opportunity to earn extra credit throughout the year. Examples are: Word of the Week, Fun Runs, Walk-A-Thons, Hoop Shots, Sports Clinics.</li></ul>
