<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Mathematics is a language and tool used in a vast range of human activities: business, science, economics, the professions and trades.  It is, as well, an intellectual exercise worthy of study in its own right.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Various programs are found below that follow New York State guidelines and prepare students for future work and study.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Different instructional modes are used to meet the varying needs of students.  Traditional classes, computer assisted instruction and microcomputers are used where appropriate.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Mathematics Program is organized into two different sets of courses, non-Regents and Regents.  The non-Regents Program is open only to sophomores, juniors, and seniors.  All freshmen must be in the Regents Program.</P>
