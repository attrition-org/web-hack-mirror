</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The world is becoming ever smaller and communication between peoples is constantly increasing in importance.  The study of foreign languages, then, should also increase if we are to fulfill the needs of the future.  The mandates of the Regents Action Plan underscore the need for foreign language study at the high school level, a study which has many rewards in the fields of international business, law, medicine, politics, and travel.  Foreign language study also leads to a better comprehension of the English language and grammar and to an increased understanding of other people and cultures.</P>
