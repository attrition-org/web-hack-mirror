<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The objective of Special Education courses is to provide each student the most appropriate educational program based on his/her individual needs.  The high school provides small group and individual instruction to permit each student to develop the skills necessary at his/her appropriate educational level. Students are placed in their least restrictive setting and challenged to their optimal learning potential.</P>

All academic courses required by the State Education Department Curriculum and teaching strategies are modified to best meet the needs of our students while still meeting SED requirements.  Students may work toward a Regents diploma, a local diploma or an IEP diploma.</P>
