<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Visual Arts Department offers a wide variety of courses ranging from the basic Studio in Art to Advanced Art.  There is no need for any special artistic talent to enjoy, and profit from, one or more of these courses.  However, if a student is talented, and interested in art as a career, he/she may select a major sequence from the courses offered.  Such students will be advised to prepare a portfolio of their work for college entrance and will probably choose to take the three-year art Regents examination.  All courses offer the standard ½ credit for one semester and a full credit for one year.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Regents Action Plan requires students to complete 1 credit in Art and/or Music by their graduation.  The following art courses fulfill this requirement.</P>
