<P>On behalf of the Glen Cove Science Department, I welcome you to our page on the Glen Cove High School website. </P>
<P>The Science Department offers a wide range of courses to test the academic strength of all our
students.  Some of our freshman have already taken Regents Biology in the eighth grade and will 
follow an Honors curriculum through Earth Science, Chemistry, and Physics.</P>
<P>Our Regents students have the opportunity to begin their state-tested courses as freshman 
taking Earth Science.  A progression of Biology, Chemistry, and Physics would follow unless a 
student preferred to take an alternative course of study once the Regents requirements are satisfied.</P>
<P>Our department offers a number of alternatives.  Electives include Space Science, Environmental Studies, Medical Technology, Forensic Science, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, and AP Physics.  In the 1998-99 school year, we are proposing two new courses, AP Environmental Science and Marine Biology.</P>
<P>Additionally, we run a Science Research class and an Advanced Science Research class.  To 
address the needs of these students, the construction of a climate controlled science research 
laboratory is expected to be completed before the end of the present school year.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The student of today lives in a world which is increasingly dependent upon science and technology.   We expect medicine to cure our ills, electronics to inform, entertain, and calculate for us and, in general, for science to improve our quality of life by solving the problems which we encounter in the physical world.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New York State Education Department requirements necessary for a high school diploma are the successful completion of a minimum of two units of science credit, passage of either the Regents Competency Test in Science or a Regents examination in Science.  Local diploma requirements are the successful completion of two units of science, passing the Regents Competency Test in Science, and a half credit in Health.  The minimum Regents diploma requirements are the successful completion of two Regents laboratory science courses.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the purpose of the Science Department at Glen Cove High School to provide each student with the skills needed to meet the requirements set forth above, and more, to give every student the opportunity to assimilate as much scientific knowledge and understanding as he/she is able to gather.  From this, it is hoped that the student will gain a liking and a respect for this vitally important field of human knowledge.</P>
