<p><font color="#008080">brazil has banned quake. now tell me,
how can a country completely ban a computer game? i mean, even
the U.S. hasnt banned it, so it cant be that bad. the government
of brazil should have no authority to pull a game like quake, or
any other game for that matter off the shelves. some brazilians
ought to form a militia and overthrow the god damn government.
viva la raza! or something. peace</font></p>
