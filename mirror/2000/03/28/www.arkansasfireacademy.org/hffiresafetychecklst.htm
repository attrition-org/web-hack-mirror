developed with the hope that its contents will help protect the homes and families that
constitute the population of people that make up our fine state. If this checklist saves
just <b>one life from fire death, </b>our goal will have been fulfilled.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">Fire Prevention in the home begins with a constant
and continuing awareness of potential fire dangers. This awareness must be apart of each
family member's continuing daily thought process. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">We the people of Arkansas live in a state that has
been recognized statistically as having the 2nd to 5th highest fire death state in the
USA.</font></strong></p>
<b>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">IT IS TIME TO CHANGE THAT. THE CHANGE BEGINS WITH
YOU AND STARTS RIGHT IN THE HOME YOU LIVE IN with the educating of your family.</font></strong></b></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">The following check list is offered to you <u><b>FREE</b></u>
of charge from the Arkansas Fire Academy with the hopes that you and your loved ones will
live a fire safe life, forever and always.</font></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">THE THREE KEYS TO FIRE SAFETY</font></strong></b></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">1. The Absolute key to fire safety lies in the word <u><b>prevention.</b>
    </font></strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  </u>
  <li><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">2. <b>Prevention</b> is<u> </u>a continuous process
    that need be applied in all activity / action that the potential for fire injury may
    occur.</font></strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">3. <b>Prevention </b>thoughts or application must be
    a daily reality that we must all be able to recall on our education to prevent fires and
    safeguard whenever the need appears.</font></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">HOME SAFETY CHECK LIST</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">A. Install Smoke alarms _______. Install on every
level of house, keeping in mind every family member must be able to hear the alarm. If you
sleep with your bedroom door closed, consider installing one inside your bedroom. A good
rule of thumb to remember is a smoke alarm will not help, if you can't hear it. So place
as many in your home as necessary to sound the alarm for all to hear. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">Note: The use of smoke alarms in your home is an
absolute requirement for a fire safe home. This simple device will protect you when you
are most vulnerable to fire and injury (when you are asleep) or it will warn you of fire
danger in an area of the house that you couldn't have recognized without the sounding of
its alarm.</font></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">B. Check your smoke alarm, at minimum yearly
_______. (The Arkansas Fire Academy recommends four checks yearly). </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">Note: Check your smoke alarms at least once a year,
make the testing of your smoke alarm a reality that associates its test with an event that
you can't forget. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">Example: TEST IT on your Birthday. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">Note: Never take batteries out of a smoke alarm for
any reason, if it is disturbing your cooking LET IT.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">NOTE:<i> The Arkansas Fire Academy recommends you
check the alarms four times yearly and do it with the help of your children. Make it fun
and make it a learning experience. </i></font></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">C. Prepare a family escape plan and practice it as
often as it takes to educate</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">every member of your household ________.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">-The escape plan or evacuation plan will allow your

of the device.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">Home Heating</font></strong></p>
