        Instructional Media Design Multimedia Course
        <p>
        <b>Project Abstract:</b><p>
The <b>Instructional Media Design Multimedia Course</b> was developed <br>
by <b>TBL&amp;R</b> and the <a href="emc.html">Department of Educational Media and Computers</a> in a  <br>
partnership between <a href="http://www.asu.edu">Arizona State University</a> and <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel Corporation</a>. This<br>
course is <b>the world's first accredited</b> multimedia instructional design<br>
<b>college-level course on CD-ROM!</b><p>
Users of the course are introduced to various forms of media and media<br>
design through the use of text, audio, video, graphics, and animation.<br>
The course is designed to give users experience in solving and producing<br>
solutions to real-world instructional design problems. It is an <b>interactive <br>
course </b>that allows students to produce all necessary designs using special<br>
production areas unique to Instructional Media Design. Production areas are<br>
actually mini-paint programs, built right into the CD-ROM, that are specific<br>
to each module.  The course is also self-instructional, giving students the<br>
opportunity to develop skills at their own pace and allowing them the time<br> 
to review and explore. <hr>
