<h2>Radio Receiver</h2>

<p>The radio receiver is an Icom <a href="http://www.icomamerica.com/receivers/R7000A.html">IC-R7000</a>. It has a frequency
range of 25 MHz to 2.0 GHz (=2000 MHz). It supports the following modulation modes: AM,
wideband FM, narrow band FM, and SSB. SSB sideband selection is done by a rear-panel
switch always set for upper sideband.&nbsp;&nbsp; The R7000 has 100 memory channels,
multiple scanning modes, front-end attenuator, infrared remote control, and loads of other
features. The radio is connected to the serial port of a PC (see below) via Icom's CI-V
Level Converter. Serial port control is a bit limited.&nbsp; For example, scanning
functions are not supported.</p>

<p>We have two R7000 receivers.&nbsp; The first one was in service from January 1997 to
March 1998.&nbsp; It was moved aside and a slightly modified R7000 has taken its place.
&nbsp; This second unit has be adapted for a future feature of the web site (frequency
scanning).&nbsp; As of mid-May 1998, these receivers have experienced 110,000 frequency
changes.&nbsp; When in use, the radio is operational 24 hours/day.&nbsp; We have never
experienced a failure of either ICOM.&nbsp; These are very rugged radios!</p>

<h2>Antenna&nbsp; [note: the antenna location has changed to Bethesda, Maryland]</h2>

<p>New site:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bethesda, Maryland</p>

<p>Old site (before 18 June 1999):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The antenna is a commercial discone (WB-1300) on a 25 foot mast. Location: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; North Latitude 39.07.532' <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; West Longitude 077.28.496'</p>

<h2>System Hardware/Software Architecture</h2>

<p>Here is a diagram of the system architecture that was published in the <small>February
1998 issue of QST Magazine.&nbsp; <a href="qst/qst.html">Click here to read the article</a>.</small></p>

<p>From the IC-R7000, radio control is via a serial link to a 233 Mhz Pentium PC running
Red Hat Linux 4.0. Audio streaming is via a sheilded audio cable to a Sun SPARC 20 running
Solaris 2.6 and a 200 Mhz Pentium running the RealAudio Encoder under Windows 95. The
Linux computer runs the web server. Web server requests from HTML forms or via the Java
applet launch CGI programs . The CGI programs are written in Perl 5. They accept requests
for frequency/mode changes, provide feedback as HTML to the requesting browser, keep
logging files, and issue unix shell commands to the Linux and Solaris computers. The shell
commands to the Linux computer run &quot;<a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/ntp/icom.tar.Z">icom</a>&quot;, a nifty control
program by David Mills at the University of Delaware. The icom program recognizes many
Icom radios and allows unix hosts to control them via the serial interface. The shell
commands to the Solaris computer start up a program called sfmike. The sfmike program is
part of the <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/#speakfree" title="Speak Freely">Speak Freely</a>.
suite of unix programs for sending and receiving <a href="gsmapps.html">GSM 6.1</a> audio.
The 200 Mhz Pentium encodes the live audio from the receiver and sends the audio to the
Solaris computer, which has a Real Audio Server.</p>

<h2>Future directions (problems remaining to be solved)</h2>

<p>The long term objective is to set up both receiving and transmitting.&nbsp; Of special
interest is the use of Web-transceivers for amature radio satellite operation.
&nbsp;Before such a station can be built, there are a number of problems that remain.
&nbsp; They include: 

<ul>
  <li>Dealing effectively with network delays, especially for tuning in CW and SSB signals</li>
  <li>Transmitting audio</li>
  <li>Antenna and doppler shift tracking mechanism</li>
  <li>Verification of the user such that only licensed hams may transmit</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dealing with network delays</h3>

<p>The best scheme for tuning signals would be a &quot;sliding frequency window with
weighted compression&quot;.&nbsp; In this scheme, the server&nbsp; would supply a data
stream that represents about 10 times the bandwidth of the desired demodulated
signal.&nbsp; For reception of a 2.5 KHz single-sideband modulated voice, the server's
data stream encodes 25 KHz of received signal.&nbsp; The 25 KHz is centered on the current
settings of the user's controls.&nbsp; The encoded data stream uses weighted compression
such that signals near the center frequency have the highest fidelity, and signals farther
from the center have increasingly lower fidelity.&nbsp; This scheme has a number of
effects.&nbsp; When the user tunes slowly, it feels much like a local radio.&nbsp; We
assume the local processor has sufficient compute power to decode the data stream with
little delay.&nbsp; When the user tunes more quickly, he will hear signals that, after a
delay, improve their fidelity.&nbsp; If the user tunes very quickly and exceeds the
passband of the encoded signal, he must wait for the system to catch up. </p>

<p>Implementation of this system would require a specialist in DSP and signal compression.
&nbsp; Any volunteers?</p>

<h3>Transmission of audio</h3>

<p>Transmission of audio is probably best done with Speak Freely or similar Internet
telephone software.&nbsp; Since the source code is available for Speak Freely, it would be
possible to modify this program to supply a VOX-like signal for the transmitter PTT.</p>

<h3>Antenna and doppler shift tracking</h3>

<p>Existing satellite tracking software can be modified to control antennas.&nbsp; The
same software could used to compensate for doppler frequency shift due to the motion of
the satellite relative to the receiver's antenna.&nbsp; Integrating this software into the
rest of the system is not simple.&nbsp; For example, the R7000 does not have a smooth
method of tuning.&nbsp; We are now studying the option of replacing the tuning knob of the
receiver (basically a pulse-type shaft encoder) with pulses generated by the computer.
&nbsp; This modification would allow smooth frequency control by the computer.</p>

<h3>Verification</h3>

<p>Still under consideration.</p>
