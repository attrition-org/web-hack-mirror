<p>The Listening Post streams audio to your computer using GSM 6.10 compression. You will
need an application that knows how to uncompress the audio stream and play it through your
computer's sound system. &nbsp;So far, the only application that works with the current
setup is Speak Freely.
Speak Freely is an easy GSM 6.10 program to install and use. &nbsp;The Speak Freely
web sites have a lot of valuable information: visit either <a href="http://www.speakfreely.org/" target="_top">Speak
Freely for Windows</a> or <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/speakfree/unix/" target="_top">Speak
Freely for Unix</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if you only want to download the
software, try <a href="http://nihrac.od.nih.gov/listener/speakfreely">here</a>. Speak
Freely is also a great way to do free voice communications over the internet,
unfortunately, it is not available for the Macintosh; it is only available for Windows and
Unix users.</p>

<p>We gave up hope for support from the DirectAudio Player on the Macintosh. It uses TCP
for GSM 6.10 and Speak Freely uses UDP. I still hope to find other GSM 6.10 sound
applications that will decode the audio stream.&nbsp; Lots more information on GSM
6.10&nbsp;can be found at the <a href="http://kbs.cs.tu-berlin.de/~jutta/toast.html#apps">TU
Berlin Deptartment of Computer Science GSM-related web site</a> or <a href="http://ccnga.uwaterloo.ca/~jscouria/GSM/gsmreport.html">John Scourias' GSM site</a>.
</p>

<p>There is a program that will stream GSM 6.10 audio to any browser that supports &nbsp;
Java.&nbsp; The software is called Vosaic RadioStudio.&nbsp; Vosaic cannot be used with
Speak Freely, so we installed and tested Vosaic RadioStudio on our server.&nbsp; (The
Vosaic company deserves thanks for supplying us with a free copy of their server
software.)&nbsp; At the moment we have stopped using it.&nbsp; It requires a dedicated
computer and we ran out of computer.&nbsp; It also did not perform as well as we had
hoped.&nbsp; Probaby, we just need more experience with using it.&nbsp; For more
information, check out the Vosaic home page at <a href="http://www.vosaic.com">http://www.vosaic.com</a>.
</p>

<p>If you have expertise in Java or audio streaming and want to offer suggestions, drop us
a line. Thanks.</p>
