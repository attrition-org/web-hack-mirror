<p>A great site!&nbsp; Thanks.<br>
Terry&nbsp; NZ6E/4</p>

<p>Great job, I followed intructions in QST and it came right up..<br>
Most impressive.<br>

<p>Wow this is really an innovative way of using the web!&nbsp; I am truly<br>
impressed by this effort.&nbsp; <br>

<p>Very nice article. For years I've only dreamed of such a remote<br>
receiver for HF. You have surely created a very useful system.<br>
Dennis&nbsp; W8NW</p>

<p>I have just try your radio-internet interface, fantastic !!!<br>
I'have just tuned ham &amp; tv &amp; other stuff,<br>
many many compliments !!<br>

<p>Read the EXCELLENT article in QST this month and tried out the site. <br>
Very neat!&nbsp; If this gets a couple of people interested in ham radio, all<br>
the better....keep up the great work...<br>
Gerry Jurrens&nbsp;&nbsp; N2GJ</p>

<p>Wow this is neat!! Nice to see this technology on the web!!<br>
dave&nbsp; N5OTY</p>

<p>What a blast.....Listening Post is absolutely the best thing I have seen<br>
in a while.&nbsp; As a ham and employee of a television station I see a lot<br>
of new &quot;technical toys&quot; but this is really great.&nbsp; I frequently get on<br>
the 147.06 machine. <br>
Mark&nbsp;&nbsp; WB8ZLQ</p>

<p>Greetings from the Tropics. The LP works great -- just as advertised Feb. QST!&nbsp; <br>
Audio better than my HT, that's for sure!<br>
The LP is a treat for me; QTH is St. Thomas, USVI, and local repeaters<br>
are deado.&nbsp; Also since I do not have UHF equipment, it gives me an ear<br>
up there.&nbsp; I think you're doing a lot of Hams a favor.<br>
Joe&nbsp;&nbsp; KP2BL &amp; VP2VBL.</p>

<p>Your Listening Post page is great.. I travel allot and now I can keep <br>
up with the Sun. night MARC net or local rag-chewing when I'm on <br>
the road. I'm using a Mac PowerBook with Real Audio and the <br>
quality is very good..&nbsp; Thanks! <br>
Gene Inman&nbsp;&nbsp; KB3CBZ </p>

<p>The page seems to be working great.&nbsp; Read the article in QST&nbsp; you folks are
to<br>
be commended in pioneering a new aspect of Amateur Radio.<br>
Larry Doddd&nbsp; K0QEC</p>

<p>I found a very interesting publication in the QST (Feb 1988). <br>
... Thank you and others for implementing the nice idea.<br>
Gedas&nbsp; KC8IUM, LY2BGP</p>

<p>Congratulations on a great job on the Internet Ham Receiver.&nbsp; It works well<br>
for me using realaudio....Keep up the great work.&nbsp; This is progress!<br>
Gus&nbsp; W3PTG</p>

<p>Good Show!! Saw the article in QST and tuned in. Congratulations. <br>
Jerry&nbsp; KB8IW</p>

<p>I enjoyed &quot;playing&quot; with your system. Will return. Thanks for the<br>
opportunity.<br>
Kenn W9MR&nbsp; </p>

<p>Tks for the chance to play with a 7000 from the East coast, I got the<br>
Dullas control tower OK . ....... I like it!!!<br>
Lee Ward&nbsp; KO1W</p>

<p>I love your site.&nbsp; I have always been wondering is Scanning over the<br>
internet was possible...<br>
Marc Kramer</p>

<p>Great work!&nbsp; Saw your article in QST today.&nbsp; Amazing.<br>
Jay&nbsp; KB5YZH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Just wanted to send a word of thanks for setting up the Listening Post. I'm<br>
sure it took a great deal of time, money, etc. I grew up in Montgomery County<br>
and it's great to be able to listen to area frequencies that I'm familiar<br>
with. I'm currently living in Northwest Arkansas.<br>
Mark&nbsp;&nbsp; K5DXR</p>

<p>Just thought I'd drop a line to let you how impressed I am with the<br>
IC-7000/ internet setup.&nbsp; I had no trouble getting in with Realplayer on <br>
the Java page.<br>
Claude</p>

<p>This is a really cool site!<br>
I lived in the Washington, DC area most of my life and just recently<br>
sold my home in Germantown, MD to accept a job offer in San Jose, CA.<br>
I really missed listening ...it brought back alot of memories this morning <br>
when I was able to tune your ICOM...in my former district ...<br>
Hope this site sticks around for a little while.<br>
Bob</p>

<p>I was able to connect and listen to ATC and NWS.&nbsp; Thanks for your hard<br>
work. I really enjoyed my experience!<br>
Brian&nbsp; KF4IRC </p>

<p>Thanks!&nbsp; Your web site is great.&nbsp; I am a ham living in Manassas and I can't<br>
receive some of the freqs. you have here.&nbsp; Keep up the good work<br>
H.T. Shilling&nbsp; KF4KMD</p>

<p>hey!&nbsp; i got everything to work.. col site!&nbsp; new to hamming and internet so<br>
this was a great mix..&nbsp; thanks for the time to put in the site and taking the<br>
time to answer questions... much appreciated!!&nbsp; 73<br>
doug&nbsp;&nbsp; KC5ZKI</p>

<p>Just wanted to say &quot;thanks&quot; for all the effort you guys put into this<br>
project.&nbsp; I read about this in QST and thought I would check it out;<br>
it's super.&nbsp; Just wanted to leave you a note of thanks.<br>
Lannes Johnson&nbsp; NJ5H</p>

<p>Good work. I read the article then came and loaded up realplay then<br>
listened for a time. Simple as that. Very easy for a non-computer person<br>
like me. Thanks for the chance to see/hear your work. Notice you are<br>
already upgrading some things. Look forward to future visits. Have you on<br>
my favorites list. FYI,&nbsp; audio very crisp and clear here, volume was level<br>
and uniform, no glicks that I could hear.<br>
Archie&nbsp; K4GA</p>

<p>I read the article in QST and gave it a try.&nbsp; Worked very well.&nbsp; Audio
quality<br>
good and a pleasure to explore.&nbsp; keep up the good work.<br>

<h2><a name="Suggestions"></a><font size="5" color="#000000" face="Arial"><strong>Suggestions,
Problems and Solutions</strong></font></h2>

<p><font color="#FF00FF">Is there a faq?</font></p>

<p>This document is the closest thing to a faq.</p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF">It would be cool to have a little up/down knob to step with.</font></p>

<p>If you have not tried the Java-enhanced page, give it a try.&nbsp; It has a
step-up/step-down function.</p>
<font color="#FF00FF">

<p>One feature you may want to consdier would be a scan option for the ham repeater
frequencies.&nbsp; Most of the time when I selected a repeater, it was not active.&nbsp; A
scan option would allow the listener to automatically scan through the preset scan
frequencies until an active repeater is found by the receiver.</font> </p>

<p>Good idea! We will add this to our list of future features. </p>
<font color="#FF00FF">

<p>One problem is that everyone keeps changing frequencies. It would be nice to have a
system where each user gets exclusive use for a preset time (e.g. 2 minutes)</font> </p>

<p>We are considering this option. It seems to work well at some web cam sites. </p>
<font color="#FF00FF">

<p>I would like to know how many &quot;inputs&quot; there are into the Listening Post
site.&nbsp; I was listening to 154.16, and then all of a sudden I was hearing
154.19.&nbsp; Does this mean anyone can change the frequency at any time even if one has
the radio tuned into a specific frequency? </font></p>

<p>With the present setup, anyone can change the frequency at any time. </p>
<font color="#FF00FF">

<p>Is there a way (through a link) to check to see what frequency the receiver is tuned
into prior to changing it?</font> </p>

<p>Yes. If your browser supports Java, try <a href="../trackstats.html">http://nihac.info.nih.gov/listener/trackstats.html</a>.
This provides a continuous update of who is using the receiver. You can find this link on
the main Listening Post Web page. Look for the antique radio image. If your browser does
not support Java, you can still see who last used the radio by looking at <a href="../settings/tail.txt">http://nihac.info.nih.gov/listener/settings/tail.txt </a>. </p>
<font color="#FF00FF">

<p>I enjoyed the story in QST about the Listening Post.&nbsp; However, the Speak Freely
software doesn't seem to download.&nbsp; Are there other sites available?</font> </p>

<p>Try downloading from the Listening Post Web site. This version may not always be up to
date, but usually it is much easier for people in North America to download it from here <a href="../speakfreely/speakfree.html">http://nihac.info.nih.gov/listener/speakfreely/speakfree.html</a>.
</p>
<font color="#FF00FF">

<p>Will webtv work on your site?</font></p>

<p>Don't know.&nbsp; Should work with Real Audio.</p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF">Just messing around with the Listening Post. Am running Speak
Freely from a 3 1/2&quot; floppy and it works out on receive so far. Don't understand how
offset is done. Is that my problem with transmitting?</font></p>

<p>Nope. Our problem. The Listening Post only does listening (so far). </p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF">I just wanted to know if the R7000 gets locked at some time in
the evening. I am not able to work the receiver late at night, here in San Diego. I am
able to hear it okay, but not able to connect to the server to change frequencies. </font></p>

<p>There was a problem with our web server crashing late at night. That problem seems to
be fixed now. </p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF">Using Netscape 4.04 on a Sun/Sparc running Solaris 2.5, the
LPcontrol applet did not display properly. The applet is rendered wider than the 600
pixels specified in javalistener.html, so the frequency list scroll bar does not appear. </font></p>

<p>There are two solutions. One is to change the font used by the Netscape on the Sun
workstation. The other is to download javalistener.html to a local file, edit the APPLET
tag to be 650 pixels wide, and add a CODEBASE parameter so it will still refer to the
Listening Post server, then run it locally. </p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF">Seems no matter what ham radio or other frequency (in MHz) I type
in, I get the same response, &quot;SORRY, CANNOT TUNE TO THE REQUESTED FREQUENCY.&quot; Am
I doing something wrong?&nbsp; For instance, I typed in freq's like 14.275, 21.425, and
always get the above response.&nbsp; Also, I don't understand why your receiver doesn't
support LSB on frequencies that default to LSB. </font></p>

<p>The Listening Post receiver covers 25 Mhz to 1.999 Ghz. It cannot receive HF
frequencies. We would love to include HF if someone wants to donate a HF ICOM rig, a CI-V
interface, and a Pentium computer. </p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF">Just ran across this site.&nbsp; Very Interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Connection with Real Audio works fine when the icon is clicked.&nbsp; Tried a connection
with Speak Freely with no luck.&nbsp; How do I configure Speak Freely for use with this
site? </font></p>

<p>For Speak Freely: <br>
1) Make sure you have SF working properly.&nbsp; The web server is also a SF echo server
for testing. <br>
2) Make sure you have RealPlayer turned off. <br>
3) Make sure SF is running before you connect to the site <br>
4) Use the Main Listening Post web page, not the RealAudio version, or use the Java page
with the SF option selected. <br>
5) If other SF users are using the site at the same time, they will steal your SF
connection. </p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF">You need a second reciever - one for the aero band people and the
other for amateur/utility listeners. </font></p>

<p>We acutally have a second R7000 here, but connecting it would require another Pentium
computer and lots of work. </p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF">There is another web page that is connected to a HF radio,
unfortunatly I lost my favorite places folder (due to a virus); I was wondering if you
knew the URL of that site? </font></p>

<p>The URL is: <a href="http://www.chilton.com/scripts/radio/R8-receiver">http://www.chilton.com/scripts/radio/R8-receiver</a>
. It is an neat site. However, it does not do streaming audio.&nbsp; It records an audio
clip off the air, then plays it back through the network. </p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF">The Java control applet does not seem to be working for me.</font></p>

<p>Here are a few things to check.<br>
1) If you are using RealAudio, be certain to click on the round dot at the top of the
control panel marked &quot;RealAudio&quot;.&nbsp; When you click there, it should launch
your RealPlayer.<br>
2) You must DOUBLE-CLICK the frequency items in the list of frequencies.&nbsp; A single
click will not work.<br>
3) Each time you do a manual frequency entry, you must choose a mode (i.e. AM, FMn, FMw,
USB) even if the mode you want is already slected.&nbsp; You cannot trust the mode unless
you actually click one of the options.&nbsp; (&quot;Step up / step down&quot; does not
require a mode selection each time.)</p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF">My Real Audio player is out of date, but I don't want to pay for
the one offered at the <a href="http://www.real.com">www.real.com</a> web site.</font></p>

<p>Go back to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.real.com">www.real.com</a> .&nbsp; In the upper
left corner is an icon to download the free version of RealPlayer 5. </p>
