instructions</a> for listening to satellites with the Listening Post. Check it out.</p>

<p>The Listening Post is really not an easy way to hear satellites, but it can be done.
&nbsp; First, you must know when to listen.&nbsp; Knowing when to listen amounts to
satellite tracking.&nbsp; You should download a satellite tracking program and learn how
to use it.&nbsp; My favorite for Windows 95 is <a href="http://www.sat-net.com/">WinOrbit</a> by C. D. Gregory, K8CG.
&nbsp; You must be certain that your computer's clock is correctly adjusted.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You must also configure your tracking program for the location of the Listening Post,
rather than your home location.&nbsp; If you choose the city of Washington, D.C., you will
be close enough to its location in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>

<p>The prefered audio format for listening to satellites is Speak Freely, rather than
&nbsp; RealAudio&#153; .&nbsp; Speak Freely has less delay between the time you change the
receiver's frequency and the time you hear a change in the audio on your computer. &nbsp;
The prefered control method for using the Listening Post is with the Java control applet
on the <a href="javalistener.html">Java-enhanced page</a>.&nbsp; The Java control applet
lets you step up and step down in frequency.</p>

<p>When you believe you have tracked a satellite well enough to know when it is overhead
of the Washington, D.C. area, you can try listening to that satellite by typing the
fequency of its beacon into the &quot;Enter frequency&quot; line of the Java applet.
&nbsp; Your tracking program should indicate the doppler shift of the satellite.&nbsp; Add
that value to the beacon frequency to compensate for the relative motion between the
Listening Post and the satellite.&nbsp; Choose the USB option and then click on the Manual
Enter button of the Java applet.&nbsp; If the satellite is at an elevation of 30 degrees
or more, and less than 4,000 Km away, you should have no problem hearing it.&nbsp; You can
step up or down in frequency near the beacon frequency to compensate for small changes in
doppler shift.&nbsp; Do this by entering a step size of 0.0002 for 200 Hz steps.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hearing the beacon is not difficult when low earth orbiting (LEO) satellites are
overhead, e.g. 60 degrees of elevation or more.&nbsp; I regularly listen to RS-10/11,
RS-12/13, and RS-15 beacons.&nbsp; Listening to a QSO on the satellite is much more
difficult.&nbsp; You must enter a frequency in the passband of the satellite downlink,
then do small frequency steps until you hear a station.&nbsp; Even after you get a
station, choosing the appropriate step size to keep the station on frequency is
cumbersome.&nbsp; We are working on two ways to make tuning easier.&nbsp; First, we will
make frequency stepping smoother by modifying the radio.&nbsp; At the moment, frequency
steps are treated the same as a manual frequency entry: it jumps to the new frequency and
creates a noise burst while doing this.&nbsp; In the future, frequency steps will simulate
an operator smoothly turning the dial on the radio.&nbsp; Second, we will program the
Listening Post to track the satellite's frequency automatically.<br>
