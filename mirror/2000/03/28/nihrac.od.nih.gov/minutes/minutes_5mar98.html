<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>OLD BUSINESS</h2>

<h3>Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) Exercises (COMMEX)</h3>

<p>On Tuesday evening February 10, Bob Haslack and Bill Hook operated K3YGG and MEMA Unit
48 during the monthly communications exercise. Messages were copied on amateur and MEMA
VHF frequencies. For the March 10 exercise John Muller and Harold Simon will operate, with
Bill Hook on call as the backup. </p>

<h3>February 19 Dinner Meeting</h3>

<p>A total of ten members and guests gathered at O'Brien's Pit Barbecue for a pleasant
evening meal and to informally discuss amateur radio and other subjects.&nbsp; Attending
the event were Steve Carroll N2DDI (who travelled around the Beltway to attend), Robin
Hobbs N3NTW, Jim Hobbs AA3DN, Joy Hook ex-WN3WWN, Bill Hook W3QBC, Esther Muller, John
Muller W3QF, Dan Reggia N3ENT, Chuck Sherman N3WTO and Mike Thomas WB3LHT.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Audit of Financial Records </h3>

<p>Following their appointment as auditors at the February 5 meeting, Dan Reggia and Bill
Hook prepared a report of NIHRAC's income and expenses in 1997.&nbsp; A copy of their
report was mailed to members along with the February meeting minutes.&nbsp; Additional
copies are available in the ECC. </p>

<h3>New Equipment Acquisitions</h3>

<p>Jim Hobbs distributed copies of the design review he and Larry Martin had prepared for
the emergency power battery cart project that had been shown at our last meeting.&nbsp;
Their report is attached to these minutes.&nbsp; In summary, the cart should perform as
expected. </p>

<p>A discussion followed as to whether a voltmeter and dummy load (to estimate battery
condition) should be included in the package.&nbsp; It was agreed that an exceptionally
rugged meter and high wattage dummy load would be needed. The estimated price of $1000 was
considered to be too low until it was learned that cost-free labor might be provided by
the shop that built the demonstration unit.&nbsp; Off-the-shelf rather than custom-built
components could be also be used to reduce the cost. </p>

<p>It was stated that for other emergency preparedness groups to be able to duplicate the
device, there is a need for detailed drawings.&nbsp; While Al Taylor has prepared some of
the documentation there is work yet to be done in this area. A discussion followed as to
whether we should consider this as only a second prototype or a product with a design
suitable for duplication by others.&nbsp; Jim Hobbs opined that preparing full
documentation might increase the cost significantly.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It was suggested that rather than purchasing the parts with cash from the club
treasury, it might be possible to obtain support from a source at NIH.&nbsp; Larry Martin
suggested that the Clinical Center would likely benefit from the availability of a
portable, 12 volt, 100 amp hr power source. </p>

<p>Bill suggested that we could approve the construction of the battery cart now.&nbsp;
Then, if no other source of funding was found, vote later to expend funds from the NIHRAC
treasury. Accordingly, a motion was made, seconded and passed to approve but not presently
fund the construction of an emergency power battery cart.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The expenditure of club funds for other equipment was next considered.&nbsp; These
items are listed below along with the action taken. </p>

<p>1) An expenditure of $1500 was approved to purchase a Kenwood TS-570D HF transceiver
plus accessories to include a 500 Hz CW filter and Astron 20A continuous/25A intermittent
switching power supply.&nbsp; A suggestion that we spend $300 additional for the TS- 570S
model with 6-meter capability was not approved. </p>

<p>2) The purchase of a Kenwood TS-50S portable HF transceiver plus automatic antenna
tuner was not approved.&nbsp; This item had been proposed primarily for digital use by the
PHS-1 DMAT while in the field.&nbsp; However, because their future in HF operations is
uncertain, it was considered unnecessary to purchase this item now, </p>

<p>3) A Kantronics KAM-Plus all-mode controller had been also proposed for HF digital use
by the PHS-1 DMAT.&nbsp; Its purchase was not approved for the reason given above. </p>

<p>4) A heavy duty replacement for the defective rotator for the NIHRAC log-periodic beam
antenna is needed.&nbsp; An estimated $540 had been budgeted for this item.&nbsp; However,
it was deemed prudent to carefully determine what the physical requirements are for
turning and braking this antenna when mounted on Building 11.&nbsp; We also need to know
more about what rotators are currently available and their costs.&nbsp; Walter Stewart,
John Muller, Chuck Sherman and Jim Hobbs volunteered to serve on a committee to evaluate
the present beam antenna.&nbsp; After it is determined what is needed we will vote on an
expenditure. </p>

<h3>Membership Renewals </h3>

<p>As of March 5, renewal forms from 10 full members and 7 affiliates have been
received.&nbsp; Renewals should be received by March 31, 1998.&nbsp; Those not renewing by
April 30, 1998 will be deleted from the list of members. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>NEW BUSINESS</h2>

<h3>Applicants for Membership </h3>

<p>David Dodell K7DSD, D.M.D., is an advanced class licensee living in Scottsdale
AZ.&nbsp; He visits the NIH campus twice yearly, would like to support NIHRAC activities
when he's available and has submitted his application for affiliate membership.&nbsp;
David operates HF, 2 meters and 70 cm. </p>

<p>Andrea L. Stewart KB3CDK is the daughter of NIHRAC President Walter Stewart.&nbsp; She
recently passed the Novice class exam and would like be an affiliate NIHRAC member.&nbsp;
In the past, Andrea has been on hand to assisted her dad during NIHRAC activities
including the B-CC YMCA Turkey Chase and Clinical Center power outage tests.&nbsp; It was
agreed that NIH regulations concerning the presence of minors in NIH buildings would be
adhered to during her participation in NIHRAC activities</p>

<h3>Election of Officers</h3>

<p>The list of candidates presented at the February meeting by the Nominating Committee
was unopposed.&nbsp; Andy Mitz made a motion that the officers who served in 1997 be
thanked for their excellent work.&nbsp; The motion was passed unanimously and the
following incumbents were reelected by acclimation. &nbsp; </p>

<p>- Walter Stewart WM3Z, President, &nbsp; </p>

<p>- Larry Martin W3IBO, Vice President, &nbsp; </p>

<p>- Albert Lock KA3WCF, Secretary-Treasurer, and &nbsp; </p>

<p>- Chuck Sherman N3WTO, Asst. Secretary-Treasurer. </p>

<h3>April 4 Clinical Center Power Outage</h3>

<p>The next power outage is scheduled for&nbsp; Saturday, April 4 from 100 to 330
p.m.&nbsp; A minimum of 12 volunteer operators are needed to cover the important
posts.&nbsp; For this test, it has been suggested that we change our usual protocol as
follows </p>

<p>- Net Control will be stationed at the Building 11 ECC rather than in the CC
cafeteria.&nbsp; A second op should be present to assist. </p>

<p>- The primary frequency will be 447.925 MHz SIMPLEX.&nbsp; NIHRAC's YAESU FT-7200 or
the DMAT Bendix-King Model EMH will be used at the ECC as a UHF base station. </p>

<p>- For UHF backup, the NIHRAC repeater (447.925 MHz) will be used. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>- The NIHRAC two meter (145.29 MHz) repeater will be used as the talk-around channel
and as a back-up to UHF operation.&nbsp; NIHRAC's Midland or ICOM meter transceiver will
be used as the VHF base station. </p>

<p>- The PHS-1 DMAT's UHF handhelds need to be tested in an actual event.&nbsp; NIHRAC
volunteers will be provided with a Motorola, Bendix-King or GE transceiver to use during
the power outage. </p>

<p>Jim Hobbs suggested that Ross Merlin bring the demonstration model battery cart for use
at the Clinical Center command post. Andy Mitz suggested that a permanent
through-the-glass amateur band antenna be installed there.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Adjournment </h3>

<p>The meeting adjourned at 1:10 p.m.&nbsp; </p>

<p>PURPOSE OF SYSTEM <br>
(from presentation at February 5, 1998 NIHRAC&nbsp;meeting)</p>

<p>This system was designed to serve as a UPS for 12 V radio equipment.&nbsp; It is
intended to be used in conjunction with a gasoline powered&nbsp; generator or commercial
120 VAC power, not in stand-alone service.&nbsp; It will effectively bridge the gaps in
power resulting from refueling a gasoline generator, or from power outages in commercial
power ranging from very brief up to several hours, load permitting.&nbsp; The capacity of
the battery/ charger system is supposed to permit use of an HF radio and a 500 watt
amplifier, as an example.&nbsp; Many other load possibilities exist.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
ENGINEERING DESIGN REVIEW BY JIM HOBBS AND LARRY MARTIN<br>
<br>
The battery's 100 Amp-hour rating is currently in question, since we do not know the rated
battery voltage at the end of its discharge cycle, and radio equipment may not function at
the voltage likely to represent the manufacturer's design discharge point.&nbsp; Also
unknown are the manufacturer's rated maximum discharge current and rated number of
discharge cycles. However, the size of this battery will probably permit it to fulfill the
design goals, with loads such as that in the above example.</p>

<p>A lot of thought went into the prototype's design.&nbsp; The output connections are
numerous and easy to get to, and likely to be about as convenient as one could come up
with.&nbsp; All output circuits are fused. </p>

<p>The system appears to be about as portable as one could make it, considering the bulk
and weight of the components.&nbsp; The enclosures are rugged, but appear to not be
weather resistant, although this is a minor issue, since the equipment it powers isn't
weather resistant either.</p>

<p>By design, there is no metering included, nor is there a means for testing battery
condition.&nbsp; A voltmeter would allow users to know approximately how much battery
capacity remains.&nbsp; In the worst case, the meter could get broken in transport or use,
but then the system is no less useful than it is in the present configuration.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The system should include a simple means to test battery capacity.&nbsp; This could be
an integral part of the system, or an external device.&nbsp; It would have a load resistor
and a device to measure the time it takes the battery to reach the minimum acceptable
voltage for communication use from a fully charged state.&nbsp; By measuring this time,
the actual Amp-hour capacity would be known.&nbsp; Such a testing device would greatly
reduce the chance of system failure during use, since a bad battery would be discovered
and replaced during routine tests.&nbsp; Alternatively, the battery could be replaced at
scheduled intervals, likely to be much shorter than time to failure, but wide variations
in actual battery life require relatively frequent replacement, increasing system cost.</p>

<p>Actual cost of the system depends greatly on the cost of labor to fabricate parts and
assemble them.&nbsp; At typical machine shop and sheet metal shop rates, the fabrication
cost could easily match the cost of materials.&nbsp; Assuming no volunteer assembly labor,
this puts the cost at $2000, unless someone finds a machine shop willing to do the job for
less than typical rates.</p>

<p>-----------</p>

<p>UPDATE 3/5/98, after receiving e-mail from Al Taylor dated 3/4/98 </p>

<p>I understand that a shop is available to fabricate parts for this project at no charge,
but that no mechanical drawings exist. Because one of the goals for this system is to stir
interest among other organizations to build similar systems, it is necessary to have a
full design package available.&nbsp; This includes a layout, parts list, full set of parts
drawings, assembly drawings, schematics and wiring diagrams.&nbsp; Without such
documentation, the system is not easily reproducible, and a second&nbsp; system would
merely be another prototype.&nbsp; It is my recommendation that this design package be a
required first stage of this project.</p>

<p>The full design package would facilitate a QST article, further increasing the
likelihood of proliferation. I'm glad that Al Taylor agrees that using off the shelf
enclosures is a good idea. This can greatly reduce design time, fabrication time and parts
cost, while increasing reproducibility.</p>
