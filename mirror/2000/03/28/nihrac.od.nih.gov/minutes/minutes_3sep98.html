<p>The next meeting will be held at noon on Thursday, October 1, 1998 in the Emergency
Communications Center (ECC) located on the third floor of Building 11. Final plans will be
made for our participation in the October 3 Clinical Center power outage test.</p>

<h2>SEPTEMBER 3, 1998 MEETING MINUTES </h2>

<p>The meeting was called to order by Vice President Larry Martin at 12:10 p.m. The
minutes of the August 6, 1998 meeting were accepted as written.</p>

<h3>Attendees </h3>

<p>Members attending the meeting included Bill Hook W3QBC, Mike Kahn KA3GSV, Albert Lock
KA3WCF, Larry Martin W3IBO, John Muller W3QF, Frank Nice and Tom Vegella K1FEX. Trent
Smith KQ6ID was welcomed as a visitor and prospective member.<br>
</p>

<h3>OLD BUSINESS </h3>

<h4><br>
R7000 Antenna Project</h4>

<p>The coax cable running from the ECC to the base of the antenna was shortened, fed
through the hole in the wall and fitted with a new PL-259 connector by Bill Hook on August
11. It was found that the 115 vac outlet on the roof near the tower as well as the outlet
in the room nearby are not energized. Therefore, it was necessary to use a gas-fired
soldering iron to install the new connector. We should arrange to get power to these
outlets before attempting further work requiring soldering or drilling. A volunteer was
sought to draw SWR vs. frequency curves for the R7000 antenna. </p>

<p>Jim Hobbs has compared the R7000 vertical with the 40 meter wire dipole for use over a
path to North Carolina and has found the vertical to be satisfactory although it provided
signals two to three S units lower than the horizontally polarized dipole.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>MEMA (Commex) Exercise of August 11 </h4>

<p>John Muller again operated solo at the ECC. He used 2 meter FM to take message traffic
from MEMA Pikesville. He also made progress toward handling messages by packet radio with
the Montgomery County RACES station WA3YOO. Another effort on packet will be made during
the September 8 exercise. John requested that other members avail themselves of this
opportunity to learn message handling and how to use the transceivers in the ECC. Trent
Smith and Bill Hook offered to assist John on September 8. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Lack of Air Conditioning in the ECC</h4>

<p>Jim Hobbs was unable to get air flowing into the ECC despite experiments with the
thermostat and the air lines therein. Albert Lock offered to ask for help from maintenance
personnel. Logbooks and other NIHRAC documents were damaged in July when water leaked into
the ECC from above. A way to prevent future condensate leaks is needed. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>NIHRAC Inventory</h4>

<p>We understand that all items on the present inventory have been accounted for. Items
other than &quot;Personal Use&quot; and those valued at $5000 or more have been removed
from the list. NIHRAC should prepare it's own inventory of ECC equipment to help protect
us against loss. </p>

<p>The handout detailing instructions for the proper acquisition and disposal of
accountable NIHRAC equipment as presented by Ms. Sandra Miller at the August 6 meeting was
posted in the ECC and provided to members. We again thank Ms. Miller for her excellent
efforts toward assisting us in solving our property management problems. Andy Mitz has
suggested that Dan Reggia be appointed as Chairman of a NIHRAC Property Management Liaison
Committee that will work with the Emergency Preparedness Branch's Property Custodian to
ensure that proper procedures will be followed. The Vice President appointed Dan to this
post.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>NEW BUSINESS </h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>PHS-1 DMAT Packet Radio Project </h4>

<p>Tom Vegella has loaned the DMAT a PK-232 all-mode controller for use on VHF and HF
packet. Jim Hobbs has begun to helping Albert Lock and Tom in setting up a packet station
in the ECC for learning the techniques. Other NIHRAC members who have recently acquired
multi-mode controllers for their stations include Chuck Sherman, John Muller and Bill
Hook. They too expect to learn more about HF packet.<br>
</p>

<h4>New Member </h4>

<p>Trent Smith KQ6ID was unanimously elected to full NIHRAC membership. Trent is from
California, holds an Advanced Class license and is a Howard Hughes Institute scholar
working at the Laboratory of Chemical Physics in Building 5. He owns equipment for HF, VHF
and packet radio. Trent's interests include building equipment, HF DX contesting,
emergency preparedness and learning about digital and satellite communications. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>CC Power Outage Test October 3 </h4>

<p>The next Clinical Center Power Outage Test will be held on Saturday, October 3 from
1:00 to 3:00 p.m. All members will be contacted and urged to participate. We plan to have
two operators at the NIHRAC ECC to serve as Net Control on VHF and UHF and may use simplex
as well as both the NIHRAC VHF and UHF repeaters.<br>
</p>

<h4>ECC Clean-up </h4>

<p>After experiencing a water leak, a work party to install the R7000 antenna and DMAT
activities, the ECC has been in a state of disarray. Progress toward a cleanup has been
made by Albert Lock who transported a cartload of equipment for surplus to the EPB office.
Tom Vegella donated another cartload of unwanted non-accountable items to Larry Kress of
the FDA. More work is required to put the ECC in good order. <br>
</p>

<h4>Thanks to Those Who Provided Paper</h4>

<p>We've received several packages of paper for the ECC laser printer. Thanks to those who
responded with a contribution so that we may continue to print documents from the Internet
and other sources.</p>

<h4>Adjournment</h4>

<p>The meeting was adjourned at 12:50 pm and was followed by some additional cleanup of
the ECC.</p>
