<p>The next meeting will be held at noon on Thursday January 8, 1998 in the Emergency
Communications Center (ECC) located on the third floor of Building 11. An interesting year
lies ahead for Amateur Radio and we'll discuss our plans for 1998. </p>

<h2>MINUTES OF THE DECEMBER 4, 1997 MEETING</h2>

<p>The meeting was called to order by Vice President Larry Martin at 12:05 p.m. The
minutes of the November 6 meeting were corrected to read &quot;Larry Wolken reported that
the 10 meter band is becoming useful again&quot;.... The minutes were then approved.</p>

<h3>Attendees</h3>

<p>Attending the meeting were: Bill Hook W3QBC, Larry Martin W3IBO, Frank J. Nice, Chuck
Sherman N3WTO.</p>

<h3>OLD BUSINESS</h3>

<h4>NIHRAC Did Not Chase the Turkey </h4>

<p>We failed to receive a request to assist with communications at the Thanksgiving Day
10k Turkey Chase race. Thus, we notified members that our help was not needed. Although
the race was held, the reason for the YMCA not contacting us this year is unknown. TV News
reports indicated that the race ran through the NIH campus. It was gratifying that 12
NIHRAC members had volunteered to participate. </p>

<h4>PHS Disaster Medical Assistance Team(DMAT) Equipment</h4>

<p>The 3 UHF Motorola JT-1000 HTs sent to Transcrypt International for service under
warranty have been returned. Their problem with low transmitted audio appears to have been
corrected by replacing a wrong value capacitor on a circuit board installed by Transcrypt.</p>

<p>We will ask the PHS DMAT to give permission for NIHRAC to use their portable radios (on
amateur frequencies) to support NIH sanctioned activities. NIHRAC plans to assist in
keeping DMAT HT batteries charged and in performing an inventory of their communications
gear.</p>

<h4>Visitor Parking</h4>

<p>Eighteen additional vouchers (stamps) have been received from the CC Safety Office.
Each is good for one hour parking in a visitor lot: two stamps per vehicle are usually
required to attend a NIHRAC meeting. Frank Nice provided a map and guide to parking on the
NIH campus. Copies will be available in the ECC.</p>

<h4>Maryland Emergency Management Agency Exercise (MEMA COMMEX)</h4>

<p>John Muller and Bill Hook operated K3YGG and MEMA Unit 48 on Tuesday evening November
18. Our GE receiver for the 143 MHz MEMA frequency was troubled by what appeared to be
interference from a commercial paging service. Possible solutions to the problem were
discussed.</p>

<p>The Montgomery County RACES station WA3YOO did not participate in this exercise because
county RACES activity has been suspended indefinitely by the county-employed Coordinator
for RACES. NIHRAC has participated with Maryland State RACES (MEMA) for approximately 25
years. As long as some of our members show interest, we will continue to participate with
the state in MEMA exercises.</p>

<p>John and Bill recommended that NIHRAC acquire a surplus FAX machine for submitting
reports to MEMA and for other emergency preparedness activities. </p>

<h4>Financial Matters</h4>

<p>Our unspent equipment trade-in balance of $2087 has been deposited in the NIHRAC
checking account. This, plus the previous checking balance of $820 amounts to a sizeable
amount of money. A strategy is needed to effectively use these idle funds to procure
needed new equipment. It was noted that there is no plan in place for disposal of our
assets in the event NIHRAC disbands.</p>

<h3>NEW BUSINESS</h3>

<h4>Exercise Rolling Thunder '97</h4>

<p>An e-mail message was received by Andy Mitz on Nov. 30 from WA4MJM in Memphis, TN
asking for NIHRAC's cooperation a few days later during a simulated earthquake disaster.
Communications were to involve RACES, ARES and MARS. The station located at LeBonheur
Children's Medical Center in Memphis wanted to direct a message to K3YGG, have it
receipted and a confirmation returned by e-mail or Amateur Radio. Ways to do this were
suggested by Andy, Jim Hobbs and Ross Merlin. </p>

<p>On December 3, Bill Hook received from WA4MJM e-mail via the K3YGG packet mailbox
saying that because of time constraints they had transmitted only a standard ARRL-type
radiogram to be relayed to the ARES net and thence through MARS circuits to be delivered
to our station. So far we haven't seen it and don't know how it was addressed. Apparently
NIHRAC was selected as a participant by someone who had learned of NIHRAC's activities
from our Web site.</p>

<p>The FCC announced that as of January 1, 1998 new Forms 610, 610A and 610B must be used
for license applications, renewals and modifications. They may be obtained from the FCC
Web site at <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/formpage.html">http://www.fcc.gov/formpage.html</a>
or <a href="ftp://ftp.fcc.gov/pub/Forms/">ftp://ftp.fcc.gov/pub/Forms/</a>.&nbsp; It is
requested that a volunteer print a few forms for use by members. See page 74 of the
December 1997 QST for details. The new forms carry a certification that states the
applicant has read and will comply with 1) Section 97.13(c) of the FCC's Rules regarding
RF radiation, and 2) The amateur service section of OST/OET Bulletin No. 65, Evaluating
Compliance with FCC-Specified Guidelines for Human Exposure to Radio Frequency
Electromagnetic Fields. NIHRAC will try to obtain copies of these documents. For
information on this subject see pages 50-55 in the January 1998 QST. </p>
