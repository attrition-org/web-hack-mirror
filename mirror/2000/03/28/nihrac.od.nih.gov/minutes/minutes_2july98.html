<h2>OLD BUSINESS</h2>

<h3>Antenna Improvements</h3>

<p>The structural work being done on the west face of Building 11 may make it difficult to
hoist a new tower to the roof and to lower the old one for disposal.&nbsp; It was
suggested that we delay the planned improvements to the HF beam antenna until we learn
about the timetable for this work.&nbsp; Meanwhile, other things can be done to provide
needed improvements to the NIHRAC antenna farm. </p>

<p>It was suggested that we purchase and install a replacement for the defective HyGain
18AVT HF trap vertical.&nbsp; This antenna has been removed from the roof. </p>

<p>Last month's request for comment on vertical antennas for HF produced the following
response from Andy Mitz.&nbsp; &quot;The two people who I know use modern verticals say
that the commercial units do not perform well on 80 m.&nbsp; They do well above 80.&nbsp;
The Cushcraft R7000 is considered excellent.&nbsp; That is what Frank Putnam got. He
reports very good performance on 20, 40, and 15m (the bands he has
tested).&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>A motion was made, seconded and passed unanimously that NIHRAC purchase with funds from
the NIHRAC treasury a Cushcraft R7000 antenna with an R80 add-on kit.&nbsp; The total cost
was estimated to be $510.&nbsp; Chuck Sherman volunteered to shop for a favorable price
and to place the order.&nbsp; </p>

<p>After the meeting, an inspection team visited the roof and found a suitable mounting
bracket already installed.&nbsp; This is located on a wall and it will not be necessary to
use the railing along the south edge of the roof to attach the new antenna.&nbsp; It was
along this railing near the new cooling towers that damage occurred to the previous
antenna.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Parts Donated to NIHRAC</h3>

<p>The vacuum tubes and other items recently donated to NIHRAC remain to be evaluated and
decisions made as to their disposition.&nbsp; Andy Mitz and Larry Wolken have expressed
interest in looking them over.&nbsp; We may find them to be a source of funds for the club
treasury. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>NEW BUSINESS</h2>

<h3>NIHRAC Volunteer Callup List</h3>

<p>NIHRAC was contacted by Dee Andrews of the Clinical Center Director's Office who asked
for an updated list of radio volunteers.&nbsp; Bill Hook prepared the list and submitted
it by e-mail.&nbsp; A printed version was sent to the Clinical Center Safety
Officer.&nbsp; Additional copies are available in the ECC and members are asked to add or
delete their names as appropriate to their present situation.&nbsp; Because the callup
list gives home telephone numbers we should consider whether or not the list should appear
on the NIHRAC Web site.&nbsp; Andy Mitz advised that he could make this page password
protected. </p>

<h3>PHS-1 DMAT Deployment to Fort Pickett</h3>

<p>The DMAT will deploy July 11-24 to Fort Pickett VA.&nbsp; On June 16 Albert Lock asked
for NIHRAC's &quot;....help on setting up and learning how to use packet radio for DMAT
deployment at FT Pickett&quot;.&nbsp; He was advised that a) this would be difficult to
achieve because the time remaining was short, b) the PHS-1 DMAT may not have available the
appropriate TNC, HF transceiver, cables for interconnection, portable computer or
communications software, and c) the participants may have not acquired the needed
experience and in some cases the appropriate class FCC license to operate on the relevant
HF frequencies.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Report on the Dayton Hamvention</h3>

<p>John Muller reported on the recent Dayton Hamvention.&nbsp; Of special interest were
the forums of the low power operators (QRPers) titled &quot;Four Days in May&quot; that
are held the day before and during the Hamvention.&nbsp; Homebrew, kit building and
efficient antennas were the subjects of well presented sessions.&nbsp; The attraction of
QRP to younger hams was evident because of the lower costs and educational aspects of
building low power gear.</p>

<h3>Offer to Establish NIHRAC Mailing Lists</h3>

<p>Member David Dodell has advised that he runs two Internet servers and offers to set up
mailing lists for NIHRAC.&nbsp; We thanked David for his offer and will call upon him when
it appears that a backup will be needed.&nbsp; The k3ygg sysop advised that it's unlikely
that k3ygg.ampr.org will suffer a prolonged outage even in the event of computer failure
at the ECC.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Changes to NIHRAC Membership List</h3>

<p>The following entries were changed: Binstock, Jon Glass, Seth Johnson, Jeff Sherman,
Chuck </p>

<h3>Missing Members</h3>

<p>It was suggested that the NIHRAC President contact those who failed to respond to our
recent membership renewal effort.&nbsp; The purpose would be to let non-renewing members
know that their presence is missed and it's not necessary to submit a new member
application to reinstate their membership. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Adjournment </h3>

<p>The meeting was adjourned by the Vice President at approximately 1:00 p.m.</p>
