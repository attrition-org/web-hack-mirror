<h2>OLD BUSINESS</h2>

<h3>Antenna Repair Team</h3>

<p>The Vice President asked if there had been any progress made in upgrading the ECC
antennas and tower. No report was forthcoming. It was suggested that the damaged Hy-Gain
18AVT HF vertical be removed from the roof. </p>

<h3>April 4 Clinical Center Power Outage</h3>

<p>NIHRAC volunteers included Andy Mitz, Al Taylor, Jim Hobbs, Quin Marsh, Harold Simon,
Chuck Sherman, Bill Hook, Larry Wolken, John Muller, Larry Martin, Mike Thomas and Ernst
Gehrels. A written report has been prepared and distributed. </p>

<p>Features of the test included the use of 447.925 MHz simplex as the primary frequency
rather than VHF and the opportunity to evaluate the PHS-1 DMAT's Motorola JT-1000 HTs.
Ross Merlin has subsequently provided information about how the JT-1000's squelch may be
adjusted and how an earphone may be attached. We learned that NIHRAC is considered a major
player in these events as evidenced by the managers waiting until all NIHRAC volunteers
had reported in from their posts before beginning the test. </p>

<h3>Communications Assistance to Parklawn Classic Race and Walk</h3>

<p>On Friday, April 24 NIHRAC members Jon Casamento, Bill Hook, Larry Martin, Al Taylor,
Tom Vegella and Bryan West participated with the Parklawn Amateur Radio Club to provide
radio contact around the course that traversed portions of Parklawn Drive, Twinbrook
Parkway and Veirs Mill Road. Bryan noted that there were approximately 300 runners and
1000 walkers. Bryan was commended for his excellent job of organizing the radio operators
and serving as Net Control. </p>

<h3>Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) Exercises (COMMEX)</h3>

<p>On Tuesday evening April 14 Bill Hook operated K3YGG and MEMA Unit 48 during the
monthly communications exercise.&nbsp; Seven messages were received and one sent.&nbsp; <em>Volunteers&nbsp;are
needed for the May 12 activity</em>.</p>

<h3>Emergency Power Cart Project</h3>

<p>Bill Hook suggested that we undertake a fund raising campaign to purchase parts for the
project.&nbsp; This might involve accepting donations of used equipment as well as
cash.&nbsp; He offered to donate for sale a vintage Heathkit station consisting of a
SB-303 receiver, SB-401 transmitter, SB-610 monitor Scope and SB-620 panadapter as well as
other items of possible value to collectors.</p>

<h3>NIHRAC Treasury</h3>

<p>Thanks were bestowed to Assistant Secretary-Treasurer Chuck Sherman who dealt with the
NIH Federal Credit Union to update the authorized signatures for our account and to
correct the address to which they have been (mis)sending our monthly statements.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Dues collected this year from full members amounted to $100.&nbsp; A $15 cash
contribution from member Vernon Taylor was acknowledged with thanks.</p>

<h3>Kenwood TS-570 Performance Report</h3>

<p>Jim Hobbs reported by HF packet radio from North Carolina that NIHRAC's new transceiver
in the ECC &quot;has made a large difference in the performance of the HF port&quot;.
&nbsp; He said he believes that its better filtering and good frequency stability are the
reasons for the improvement over the TS-820 previously used.&nbsp; Jim notes that the HF
path back to k3ygg is much more reliable than the multihop VHF method and that he's been
keeping an eye on the k3ygg mailbox from afar. </p>

<p>Instructions for using the TS-570 on CW and SSB are posted on the shelf holding the
transceiver.&nbsp; After exploring these modes please return it to packet use as the note
describes.</p>

samples.</p>
