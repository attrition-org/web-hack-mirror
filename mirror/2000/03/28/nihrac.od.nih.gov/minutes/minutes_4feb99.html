<h2 align="center">FEBRUARY 4, 1999 MEETING MINUTES</h2>

<p>The meeting was called to order by President Walter Stewart 12:10 pm in the Building 11
ECC. The minutes of the January 7 meeting were approved as distributed. </p>

<h3>Attendees </h3>

<p>Members attending the meeting included Ed Gordon KB3DBX, Bob Haslach N3FRT, Bill Hook
W3QBC, Albert Lock KA3WCF, Larry Martin W3IBO, John Muller W3QF, Frank Putnam N3ZPQ, Chuck
Sherman N3WTO, Harold Simon N3PXK, Walter Stewart WM3Z, Tom Vegella K1FEX and Bryan West
K2BW. </p>

<h3>OLD BUSINESS </h3>

<h4>Mysterious Radio Noises Recording </h4>

<p>Bill Hook has begun to record some of the sounds of digital signals heard on the
Amateur Radio frequencies. Using a video camera to photograph the receiver frequency plus
the decoded text appearing on a computer screen, the accompanying audio will be heard and
the audience asked to identify the &quot;mysterious radio noise&quot;. The modes to be
presented will include radioteletype (Baudot RTTY &amp; ASCII), packet, PACTOR, AMTOR,
GTOR and others. </p>

<h4>Elements of the NIHRAC Infrastructure </h4>

<p>An updated list of club projects and activities was distributed with last month's
printed minutes and is available on the NIHRAC Web site. Mentioned are the several radio
systems that NIHRAC maintains and it was suggested that we consider one or more of these
at each meeting. Noting that our newly installed R7000 vertical antenna had recently lost
its upper half, it was suggested that the topic for the day be item 1B - &quot;Antennas
(Bldg.11)&quot;. Thus, some members went to the roof after adjournment to inspect the
NIHRAC antenna farm. A summary of their findings is attached to these minutes. At the
March meeting we will continue the discussion of NIHRAC's antennas. </p>

<h3>NEW BUSINESS </h3>

<h4>Amateur Radio and the Ice Storm of January 14-15, 1999 </h4>

<p>It was noted that the Montgomery County RACES was activated during the power outages
that accompanied the storm. NIHRAC was acknowledged for the use by RACES of our 145.29 MHz
repeater to support communications between the Rockville EOC and the East County Warming
Center located in Silver Spring. </p>

<p>Walter Stewart reported that after losing telephone service because of the storm he
used the autopatch on the NIHRAC 447.925 MHz repeater to arrange pickup of his son in
Silver Spring. Walter also stated that daughter Andrea has been recognized at Churchill
High School as an emergency resource capable of making telephone calls via Amateur Radio
using her FT50 HT when the school's phones (including cellular) fail. </p>

<p>It was mentioned that the log periodic HF beam antenna at the Parklawn Building used by
the DHHS Office of Emergency Preparedness suffered a broken boom as a result of icing.
Larry Martin mentioned that he had experienced damage to his antennas and house. </p>

<h4>MEMA (COMMEX) Exercise for February </h4>

<p>John Muller advised that he will represent NIHRAC for the February 9 exercise. Members
were invited to be on hand at the ECC from 7:00 - 9:00 pm to help John and learn something
about message handling and operating the equipment at our station. </p>

<h4>Nominating Committee </h4>

<p>The Nominating Committee appointed at the January 7 meeting consisting of Andy Mitz,
Dan Reggia and Bill Hook presented the following slate of officers. </p>

<p>President - Walter Stewart Vice President - Albert Lock Secy./Treas. - Chuck Sherman
Asst. Secy./Treas. - open </p>

<p>There were no additional nominations made from the floor. Frank Putnam volunteered to
be a candidate for the position of Assistant Secretary/Treasurer but stated that he will
be able to serve only until July. His offer was accepted and the above names, plus any
additional nominations made, will be voted upon at the March meeting. </p>

<p>Noting the past service of Larry Martin as President and his present activities as Vice
President and Trustee of the K3YGG license, the Committee recommended that Larry be
recognized as President Emeritus. A motion to this effect was made, seconded and passed
unanimously. </p>

<p>It was mentioned that emeritus status might be bestowed upon other past officers who
continue to actively serve the NIHRAC after their retirement from federal service. </p>

<h4>Financial Contribution from NI3A </h4>

<p>C. Hume McClure NI3A was thanked for his contribution of $15. Although not a NIHRAC
member, Charles uses our 2 meter repeater and participated with us on Thanksgiving morning
to help provide communications for the Turkey Chase foot race benefitting the
Bethesda-Chevy Chase Youth Services. </p>

<h4>NIH Continuity of Operations Plan </h4>

<p>As mentioned at the February meeting, Andy Mitz has offered to cooperate with the NIH
Emergency Planning Coordinator in updating the role of NIHRAC in the Disaster Preparedness
Plan and to consider our participation in a future exercise. Andy will meet with Bill
Magers in the ECC on February 23 at 8:15 a.m. </p>

<h4>Parklawn Classic Event </h4>

<p>Bryan West invited NIHRAC to assist the Parklawn Amateur Radio Club in providing radio
communications support for the Parklawn Classic foot race to be held at noon on Friday,
April 30. Further information will be forthcoming. </p>

<h4>The NIHRAC ECC-CDRH Connection </h4>

<p>Tom Vegella suggested that the facility located at 12709 Twinbrook Parkway be
designated as a subunit (satellite) of the NIHRAC Bethesda NIHRAC ECC. He noted that some
PHS-1 DMAT equipment is kept in readiness there and that an amateur 2 meter/70 cm FM voice
and packet radio station is in operation using the callsign KB3DBX. Tom mentioned the
possibility of remote, computer controlled operation of K3YGG HF transceivers from
&quot;12709&quot; using a VHF or UHF link and suitable interfaces. Other amateurs at
Twinbrook include Bryan West and Ed Gordon. Tom said that security issues concerning
access can be worked out. </p>

<p>It was noted that the callsign of the Parklawn amateur station is now W3PHS, replacing
WA3VVK. Ross Merlin (WA2WDT) is the Telecommunications and Communications Resources
Manager for the PHS/Office of Emergency Preparedness/NDMS. (OEP). </p>

<p>The meeting was adjourned at 12:50 p.m. </p>

<h2>REPORT </h2>

<h3>INSPECTION OF NIHRAC ANTENNAS </h3>

<p>After the meeting some members visited the Building 11 roof to inspect for damage
following the recent ice storm. </p>

<p>A) Cushcraft R7000 HF Vertical </p>

<p>1) The upper half was broken off just above the lower set of guys and was found laying
on the roof interior to the walled area where the antenna is attached. </p>

<p>2) It could not be determined if the breakage occurred as a result of wind and ice or
if it was stuck by something during the recent installation nearby of a boom at the site
where the new cooling tower will be erected. </p>

<p>3) Unneeded guy ropes were removed, the broken part of the antenna taken to the ECC for
storage and additional yellow warning tapes attached to the guys still in place. </p>

<p>4) The 20 ft. wooden ladder contributed by a NIHRAC member and used by volunteers to
install the antenna on August 6, 1998 could not be found on the roof. Without a ladder of
this height we will be unable to remove the remaining sections to effect repair. </p>

<p>B) KLM Log Periodic Beam Antenna </p>

<p>1) This antenna seems to have escaped damage although a few elements have rotated a few
degrees off-axis and are no longer horizontal. These can be straightened and their clamps
tightened. The beam remains locked in place awaiting replacement of its rotator and tower.
</p>

<p>C) Other antennas </p>

<p>The wire dipole used for HF packet appears to have sagged a bit but is still up. A mast
to support the west end would be a useful addition. </p>

<p>The Hy-Gain 18AVT trap vertical mounted on the iron railing near the present cooling
towers appears to be intact. No damage was noted to the various VHF and UHF antennas. de
