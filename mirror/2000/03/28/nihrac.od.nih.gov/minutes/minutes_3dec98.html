<h4>MEMA (Commex) Exercise of November 10, 1998 </h4>

<p>John Muller, Trent Smith and Bill Hook were again on board at the NIHRAC ECC to operate
K3YGG and MEMA Unit 48. Six exercise messages were copied using the Davidsonville 147.105
MHz repeater and the MEMA Voice Network frequency. Contact was also made with the
Rockville EOC using the 220 and 440 MHz bands. No MEMA exercise is scheduled in the month
of December. </p>

<p>Power Plant Asks NIHRAC Members to Sign In At Engineer's Desk </p>

<p>Following the announcement made at last month's meeting, Jim Hobbs was given additional
information by Power Plant personnel who said that regardless of the time or day, persons
entering the ECC should first sign in at the engineers desk on the G level. When leaving
Building 11 please sign out on the same line in their logbook. In the case of meetings,
one person can sign in for all. It is not necessary to list names of all attendees. John
Muller was thanked for signing us in and out for this meeting. The Power Plant's intent is
to permit notifying ECC occupants in the event of an emergency requiring a building
evacuation.</p>

<h3>NEW BUSINESS </h3>

<h4>KB3DBX Elected to Membership </h4>

<p>The application submitted by Edward Gordon KB3DBX for Full Membership was approved by
unanimous vote. </p>

<h4>Topics for NIHRAC Meetings in 1999</h4>

<p>Those in attendance came up with good topics for discussion at future meetings. These
included: </p>

<p>a) Mysterious Noises - identifying unusual signals heard in the ham bands such as
PACKET, RTTY, ASCII, AMTOR, PACTOR, GTOR, SSTV etc. If we can capture these sounds on
cassette tape they'll be played at a meeting and a contest held to see who can identify
the greatest number. </p>

<p>b) What is trunking? How does it work? </p>

<p>c) Amateur Radio in space including satellite transponders, SAREX and Mir. </p>

<p>d) Elements of the NIHRAC infrastructure including our FM repeaters, transceivers,
antennas, test equipment and the packet- Internet connection. </p>

<h4>NIHRAC Mission Statement </h4>

<p>It had been suggested that for the purpose of justifying our existence it may be useful
to adopt a Mission Statement that defines in a sentence or two what NIHRAC's goals now
are. This would supplement but not amend wording in the NIHRAC Constitution that defines
our purpose as follows: </p>

<p>a. To develop and maintain a capability, in personnel, technique and equipment, to
provide emergency communications for the National Institutes of Health. </p>

<p>b. When feasible, to provide communications and assistance in the areas of Civil
Defense and Disasters. </p>

<p>The above was written at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the 1960s and while
it's not recommended that we change the Constitution, it may be worthwhile to update our
thinking. For example, because of rigorous competition for space in the radio spectrum by
commercial interests, Amateur Radio frequencies are in jeopardy. We should encourage
activities that in addition to those mentioned above will help to protect the amateur
bands. </p>

<p>It was the sense of those in attendance that the wording of the Constitution was
adequate but that the term &quot;Civil Defense&quot; is outmoded. Our activities in
assisting other federal as well as state, county, and community entities should be
considered. Suggestions for a current Mission Statement are requested and further
discussion of the subject will be held at a future meeting.</p>

<h4>Adjournment</h4>

<p>The meeting was adjourned at 12:50 pm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Announcements </h4>

<p>Reminder - the January 7 NIHRAC meeting will be held at the Center for Devices and
Radiological Health (CDRH) lab in Rockville. Free parking will be available but carpooling
is suggested. </p>

<p>Andy Mitz advises that the Amateur Radio Listening Post has made the &quot;hot
list&quot; of 20 active web sites in the book titled &quot;WebDeveloper.com Guide to
Producing Live Webcasts&quot; by J. Novak and P. Markiewicz. You can access the Listening
Post via the NIHRAC web site. </p>
