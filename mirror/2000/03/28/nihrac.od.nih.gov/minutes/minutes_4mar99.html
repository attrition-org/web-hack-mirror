<h2 align="center">MARCH 4, 1999 MEETING MINUTES</h2>

<p>Vice President Larry Martin called the meeting to order at 12:10 p.m. He presided until
President Walter Stewart arrived and assumed conduct of the proceedings. </p>

<h3>Attendees </h3>

<p>Members attending the meeting included Akihiro Hashimoto AA3RV, Bill Hook W3QBC, Albert
Lock KA3WCF, Larry Martin W3IBO, Andy Mitz WA3LTJ, Chuck Sherman N3WTO and Walter Stewart
WM3Z, </p>

<h3>OLD BUSINESS </h3>

<h4>Mysterious Radio Noises Recording </h4>

<p>Bill Hook gave Chuck Sherman a copy of his videotape for review. After final editing,
the VHS tape will be made available for loan to interested members and for showing after a
meeting. </p>

<h4>Damaged HF Antenna </h4>

<p>As we learned after the last meeting, the top half of our new Cushcraft R7000 HF
vertical antenna has been broken off. The cause remains unknown and no progress has been
made toward removing the remaining portion so that we can determine what is needed to
effect repair. Our 20 foot wooden ladder marked &quot;K3YGG&quot; and &quot;NIHRAC&quot;
is missing. A search of the area around Building 11 should be undertaken so that we can
retrieve it to work on the antenna. </p>

<h3>NEW BUSINESS </h3>

<h4>Election of Officers </h4>

<p>There were no additional nominations made at the meeting. The following slate submitted
by the Nominating Committee at the February meeting was elected by unanimous vote:
President - Walter Stewart WM3Z, Vice President - Albert Lock KA3WCF, Secy/Treas - Chuck
Sherman N3WTO and Asst. Secy/Treas - Frank Putnam N3ZPQ. </p>

<h4>Financial Matters </h4>

<p>The following expenditures were approved by unanimous vote: - $8.25 for twenty-five 33
cent stamps, - $24.00 for T-MARC dues and, - an amount not to exceed $200 for repair of
the Cushcraft R7000 antenna. </p>

<p>A decision was deferred concerning the purchase of a wide-band UHF/VHF antenna for the
NIHRAC Listening Post receiver, soon to be relocated to the NIH Bethesda campus. A member
has offered to donate a suitable antenna for the project. </p>

<p>The President appointed Chuck Sherman and Bill Hook to serve as a committee to conduct
the annual audit of NIHRAC's finances. </p>

<h4>NIH Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) </h4>

<p>Andy Mitz reported on his meeting with NIH Emergency Planning Coordinator Bill Magers
on February 22. Andy provided the following summary of his talk. </p>

<p>The NIH Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) is important to NIH's role in the
Continuity of Government operations, on a National level. The program's purpose is to
ensure that essential NIH functions will continue in the event of a catastrophic event,
man-made or natural. </p>

<p>An overview of the Plan was presented, covering: 1) type of emergencies, 2)
classifications of emergencies, 3) role of communications during emergencies, 4) command
structure, 5) role of Logistics Team, 6) Plan testing, and 7) Plan activation. </p>

<p>NIHRAC has been included in the Plan as part of the Logistics Team. The Plan recognizes
that normal communications could be disrupted during major emergencies, that Amateur Radio
may be the only alternative available, and that communications are critical to successful
recovery. </p>

<p>It is our responsibility to provide Mr. Magers a description of what functions we could
fulfill to aid NIH in the event of an emergency either here in Bethesda, or at one of the
remote NIH sites including Poolesville, MD, Hamilton, MT or Research Triangle Park, N.C.
Along with the list of emergency services we could provide as a club, we must list those
items needed to enhance our equipment or facilities sufficiently to provide the services
listed. This request implies that funds could be provided to beef up our capacity to
support the NIH. </p>

<p>All present were enthusiastic about the opportunity to work with Mr. Magers on having
the NIHRAC integrated into the COOP. </p>

<p>A listing in draft form of what NIHRAC now has and what we will need to strengthen our
participation was presented at the meeting. A final version of the list will be sent to
Mr. Magers.&nbsp; </p>

<h4>FCC Forms 610 </h4>

<p>The supply of FCC Amateur Radio forms in the ECC are obsolete. A volunteer is needed to
download these from the FCC Web site. </p>

<h4>Adjournment </h4>

<p>The meeting was adjourned by the President at 1:05 p.m. </p>

<h4>Announcements </h4>

<p>Congratulations to Chuck Sherman who passed the test for the Advanced Class license on
March 4 at the Landover, MD VEC session. </p>

<p>A member has for sale a Kenwood TS-830 HF transceiver with matching speaker and
external VFO. Contact Bill Hook W3QBC for details. </p>
