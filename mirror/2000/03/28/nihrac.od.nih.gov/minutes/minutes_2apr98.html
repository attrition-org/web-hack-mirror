<h2>ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2>

<p>none </p>

<h2>OLD BUSINESS</h2>

<h3>Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) Exercises (COMMEX)</h3>

<p>On Tuesday evening March 10, John Muller and Harold Simon operated K3YGG and MEMA Unit
48 during the monthly communications exercise.&nbsp; Six messages were copied and
receipted on 2 meters and 3 messages on the MEMA VHF frequency.&nbsp; For the April 14
exercise John asked for at least one additional volunteer plus a backup operator.&nbsp;
This will be a good opportunity to become familiar with some of the communications
equipment in the ECC. </p>

<h3>Inventory of NIHRAC Equipment</h3>

<p>No progress was reported in continuing the preinventory survey of NIHRAC
equipment.&nbsp; Sandy Miller, AO for the Emergency Management Branch, did not visit as
planned after the March 5 meeting to continue the survey. </p>

<h3>Purchase of Kenwood TS-570D HF Transceiver</h3>

<p>On March 28 Jim Hobbs picked up NIHRAC's new TS-570D transceiver from the Maryland
Radio Center and installed the accessory 500 Hz CW filter.&nbsp; The Astron SS25
continuous duty switching power supply was received on April 7 and both are now being
tested in the ECC as part of the k3ygg packet-Internet system.&nbsp; The total cost for
all items including tax was $1458.35 and was paid with funds from the NIHRAC treasury. </p>

<h3>Emergency Power Cart Project</h3>

<p>The Committee appointed to report on this project has agreed that the next step is to
prepare a complete set of drawings and a parts list so that a precise estimate of costs
can be made.&nbsp; Al Taylor has agreed to do this.&nbsp; After the documentation becomes
available and when NIHRAC votes to fund the project, Al will purchase the needed items
with the understanding that he will be repaid.&nbsp; Additional comments are sought on the
Report that was attached to the March meeting minutes.&nbsp; Please send them to
battery@k3ygg.ampr.org. </p>

<h3>Report of the Antenna Repair Team</h3>

<p>After last month's meeting, Jim Hobbs and Bill Hook inspected the KLM log periodic beam
antenna and concluded that it would not be worthwhile for the Team to meet to do work as
planned on Thursday March 12.&nbsp; This decision was reached after the preliminary
inspection revealed the following </p>

<p>The crank-up tower is badly rusted and should be replaced.&nbsp; We need to do this as
well as purchase an extra heavy-duty rotator. The purchase of a rotator should be delayed
until a suitable tower is obtained.&nbsp; The present tower is too small to accept a
rotator of the appropriate size.&nbsp; A crew of volunteers plan to bolt a donated 20 ft
fixed tower in place during the summer.&nbsp; It was estimated that a heavy duty,
worm-drive, locking rotator such as the M2 Orion will cost approximately $1050.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the antenna needed to be immobilized to prevent its rotation and wrapping of
feedline around the mast.&nbsp; Thus, Jim fabricated and installed a clamp to prevent the
beam from turning in the wind.&nbsp; It's now fixed pointing west. </p>

<h3>Membership Renewals</h3>

<p>As of March 17, renewal forms had been received from 14 Affiliate and 14 Full members.
A new membership roster with the names of new and renewing members will be distributed in
May. In addition, an electronic version will be sent to those receiving meeting minutes by
e-mail.</p>

<h2>NEW BUSINESS</h2>

<h3>April 4 Clinical Center Power Outage Test</h3>

<p>Plans for the power outage test to be held two days hence were discussed.&nbsp; Nine
members indicated that they would be available and several others were expected to
volunteer.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For this test, the usual frequency choices were changed so that we will use 447.925 MHz
simplex as the primary channel and the&nbsp; NIHRAC's 145.290 MHz repeater will be used
for talk-around and a VHF back-up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten Motorola JT-1000 UHF HTs belonging to
the PHS-1 DMAT will be available for members to evaluate during the test.</p>

<p>Participants will meet at the B-1 level Building 10 cafeteria at 1230 p.m.&nbsp; Before
the NIHRAC meeting the PHS-1 DMAT's Bendix- King 114 channel, 40 watt Model EMV UHF mobile
transceiver was taken out of its box and set up for the first time.&nbsp; It will be used
during the test at the NIHRAC ECC in Building 11 by &quot;Net&quot; (control).&nbsp;
NIHRAC members who are also members of the PHS-1 DMAT were urged to participate in this
test so that they might become familiar with their new equipment.</p>

<h3>Parklawn Classic Race on Friday, April 24</h3>

<p>At the August 7, 1997 meeting we agreed to assist the Parklawn Amateur Radio Club in
providing communication support for this event.&nbsp; Bryan West K2BW, President of the
Parklawn Club provided details.</p>

<p>Bryan said there will be over 1250 participants and many spectators at the
Classic.&nbsp; The radio volunteers will assist with logistical operations, such as
reporting traffic blockages and need for water at various stations; and safety operations,
such as reporting medical emergencies.&nbsp; Bryan will coordinate with Ross Merlin, OEP
Communications, for some volunteers to use government-owned radios.&nbsp; Volunteers will
check in at 900 a.m. on Friday April 24 and they will be given a free T-shirt and a
catered lunch.&nbsp;&nbsp; A mandatory training session on Monday April 20 will be held
prior to the actual event.&nbsp; Tom Vegella will obtain parking for NIH employees at the
Twinbrook Center.&nbsp; Forms were provided for volunteers to fill out and return to
Bryan.&nbsp; If there are questions please call Bryan at work (301-443-4686).</p>

<h3>New Members</h3>

<p>Brian West K2BW was elected to full membership and Ernst Gehrels N3QX was approved for
affiliate membership.&nbsp; Both hold Extra Class licenses and are active on HF, VHF and
UHF.&nbsp; We welcome them and their skills to NIHRAC. </p>

<h3>Mission to Haiti</h3>

<p>Albert Lock and Frank Nice reported on a recent &quot;mission of mercy&quot; that Frank
organized to provide medical assistance to the people of Leon, a small town located in a
remote part of Haiti. Most of the volunteers were Public Health Service officers,
including some from the PHS-1 DMAT.&nbsp; When not working at the clinic Albert had an
opportunity to visit a 100 watt radio broadcasting station in Jerimi, a town located on
the coast. Among its equipment was a HF transceiver (Yaesu FT50C) that was permanently set
to only one (a non-amateur) frequency.&nbsp; It was used mainly to receive messages from
Port Au Prince.&nbsp; Albert and Frank plan to help establish an Amateur Radio station in
Leon.</p>

<h3>Adjournment </h3>

<p>The meeting was adjourned at 110 p.m. by Vice President Martin.</p>
