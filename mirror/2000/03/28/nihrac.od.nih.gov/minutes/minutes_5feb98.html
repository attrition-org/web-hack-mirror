<h2>ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2>

<h3>Ira N3JOQ...SK</h3>

<p>It is with sadness that we report the death of Ira Tice N3JOQ from congestive heart
failure on January 25 at Shady Grove Hospital.&nbsp; For the past 6+ years Ira served as a
control operator for the NIHRAC 145.29 MHz repeater.&nbsp; He was also a frequent member
of local nets and participated in a number of club activities.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>OLD BUSINESS</h2>

<h3>DMAT and NDMS Happenings</h3>

<p>Ross Merlin gave an after-event summary of communications activities during the January
deployment of NDMS/DMAT personnel following the severe ice storm and flooding that
occurred in the northeastern states.&nbsp; The support provided by Amateur Radio operators
in the affected areas was noteworthy.&nbsp; Al Taylor mentioned that NDMS traffic should
be self-sufficient and not tie up local amateur frequencies.&nbsp; Ross noted that the
Parklawn Amateur Radio station has received the new callsign W3PHS, replacing WA3VVK. </p>

<h3>Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) Exercises (COMMEX)</h3>

<p>On Tuesday evening January 13, John Muller operated K3YGG and MEMA Unit 48 during the
monthly exercise and found himself being asked to copy message traffic on two frequencies
at the same time.&nbsp; Undaunted, John managed to do so but suggested that in the future,
we recruit a volunteer to be on-call to help out in the event that the scheduled second
operator is unable to attend. Bob Haslack and Bill Hook offered to participate in the
February 10 COMMEX. </p>

<h3>Planned Equipment Acquisitions</h3>

<p>Ross Merlin displayed and described a prototype of the portable, battery power source
for which NIHRAC has been asked to provide funding.&nbsp; The design incorporates a
sealed, deep-cycle storage battery along with charging and power distribution circuits
mounted on a light-weight hand cart with foldover handle.&nbsp; A discussion followed and
Al Taylor provided additional details. The&nbsp; estimated cost for parts is $986.&nbsp;
Walter Stewart endorsed the plan to have the design studied by a committee of NIHRAC
members prior to appropriating funds. <br>
Suggestions for other equipment purchases were received and these included a Kenwood
TS-570D HF transceiver with ac power supply and 500 Hz CW filter, a Kenwood TS-50S
portable HF transceiver with automatic antenna tuner, a Kantronics KAM-Plus all-mode
controller and a heavy duty rotator for our log-periodic beam antenna.&nbsp; A budget in
draft form listing expected income and expenditures in 1998 was presented by Bill
Hook.&nbsp; It was noted that the proposed expenditures would exceed our cash
resources.&nbsp; Members will vote at a forthcoming meeting on what equipment should be
purchased with funds from the NIHRAC treasury. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>NEW BUSINESS</h2>

<h3>NIH-wide Inventory</h3>

<p>We were advised by the Chief, Emergency Management Branch, that it is necessary for his
office to physically survey all EMB- listed NIHRAC property.&nbsp; This is to be done
prior to the actual inventory that will be conducted by contract personnel.&nbsp; The
survey was begun following the meeting. </p>

<h3>Nomination of NIHRAC Officers for 1998</h3>

<p>The Nominating Committee meeting has contacted the incumbent officers and all agreed to
be nominated to serve in the coming year.&nbsp; Thus, the following nominations were&nbsp;
presented Walter Stewart, President; Larry Martin, Vice President; Albert Lock,
Secretary-Treasurer and Chuck Sherman, Assistant Secretary- Treasurer.&nbsp; No additional
nominations were made.&nbsp; The election will be held at the March 5 meeting. </p>

<h3>Audit Committee</h3>

<p>The President appointed Dan Reggia and Bill Hook to serve as a committee to audit our
1997 financial records.&nbsp; It was mentioned that at the end of 1997 we had $3247.85 in
the NIH Credit Union. </p>

<h3>Renewal of Memberships</h3>

<p>Every two years NIHRAC all memberships expire and all are asked to renew.&nbsp; A
renewal form will be mailed to members in early February.&nbsp; Dues for full members are
$5 for two years and cover the period April 1, 1998 through March 31, 2000.&nbsp;
Affiliate members do not pay dues but are expected to provide support by their
participation in NIHRAC activities. <p/> </p>

<h3>Evening Meeting</h3>

<p>It was proposed that we soon hold a dinner meeting.&nbsp; This is to provide an
opportunity to meet with those members unable to attend our noontime meetings and to
discuss current Amateur Radio issues in informal surroundings.&nbsp; Thursday February 19
at O'Brien's Pit Barbecue were chosen as the time and place.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Clinical Center Power Outage Test</h3>

<p>The next power outage test is scheduled for Saturday, April 4 from 100 to 330 pm.&nbsp;
A minimum of 12 volunteers are needed to provide radio communication. </p>
