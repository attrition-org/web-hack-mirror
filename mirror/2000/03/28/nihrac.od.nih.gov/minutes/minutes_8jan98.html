<p><font SIZE="2">The next meeting will be held at noon on Thursday February 5, 1998 in
the Emergency Communications Center (ECC) located on the third floor of Building 11.
&nbsp; Nominations of officers for the coming year will be presented by the Nominating
Committee and will also be accepted from members attending the meeting.</font> </p>

<h2>MINUTES OF THE JANUARY 8, 1998 MEETING</h2>
<font SIZE="2">

<p>The meeting was called to order by President Walter Stewart at 1210 p.m.&nbsp; The
minutes of the December 4 meeting were accepted as distributed.</font> </p>

<h3>Attendees</h3>

<p><font SIZE="2">Attending the meeting were&nbsp; Jim Hobbs AA3DN, Bill Hook W3QBC, Larry
Martin W3IBO, Andy Mitz WA3LTJ, John Muller W3QF, Chuck Sherman N3WTO and Mike Thomas
WB3LHT.</font></p>

<h3>OLD BUSINESS</h3>
<font SIZE="2">

<p>Turkey Chase Mystery Solved&nbsp; Walter Stewart reported that new staff members at the
B-CC YMCA had merely overlooked calling to ask for NIHRAC's help and our participation was
indeed missed.&nbsp; We have already been invited to take part in the 1998 event and Bill
Hook offered to send the YMCA confirmation of our availability well in advance of the 1998
event.</p>

<h2>DMAT and NDMS Happenings</h2>

<p>The PHS-1 DMAT Executive Officer has sent word that, when not otherwise needed by the
Team, NIHRAC may use their radio equipment for the&nbsp; purpose of supporting
NIHRAC-sanctioned activities.&nbsp; Ross Merlin, Telecommunications and Information
Resources Manager, PHS Office of Emergency Preparedness/NDMS has advised that NIHRAC could
assist HHS/OS/OEP by - maintaining an alternate radio room with HF capability,</p>

<p>- providing trained radio operators to staff the OEP radio room&nbsp;during disaster
activations, if requested by OEP, and by</p>

<p>- providing communications support to the NDMS DMAT PHS-1.</p>

<p>He further stated that &quot;if NIHRAC commits to these objectives (subject to the
availability of volunteers of course) it would be ppropriate for him to issue a federal
radio authorization and callsign to NIHRAC&quot;&nbsp; This might be under the name of
&quot;OEP Alternative Radio Facility&quot; and would be distinct from the PHS-1call.&nbsp;
Andy Mitz noted that this callsign would be used when our station operated on frequencies
outside the amateur bands.&nbsp; Those in attendance concurred that NIHRAC should support
the PHS in these activities. </p>

<h2>New FCC Forms 610</h2>

<p>Andy Mitz provided several copies of the new Form 610 (new/renew/upgrade/change), 610-A
(alien operator) 610B (club station) and 610V (vanity callsign). These are available in
the ECC.&nbsp; Previous editions of these forms are obsolete.</p>

<h2>Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) Exercises (COMMEX)</h2>

<p>Bill Hook operated K3YGG and MEMA Unit 48 on Tuesday evening December 9.&nbsp; During
the exercise a voice message was received from MEMA Pikesville asking &quot;CAN YOU RELAY
MESSAGES TO INTERNET IF PROVIDED WITH E MAIL ADDRESSES?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was
referred to the k3ygg SYSOP and a reply in the affirmative will be returned.</p>

<h2>Financial Matters</h2>

<p>As mentioned at the December meeting, we need a plan for disposing of funds in our
treasury should NIHRAC disband. Past president Len Aberbach has suggested that the NIH
Patient Welfare Fund be made the recipient.&nbsp; This plan of action was approved by
unanimous vote. </p>

<p>The subject of procuring additional equipment for the ECC was deliberated. Andy Mitz
proposed that approximately $800 be allocated toward the development and construction of a
portable, battery-operated emergency power cart.&nbsp; This would be stored and maintained
in the ECC and be made available for local emergency preparedness activities. Those
present expressed a variety of opinions about the practicality of the suggestion and asked
for more technical information before funds were committed. </p>

<p>Bill Hook mentioned that repair of NIHRAC's HF antennas will&nbsp; require an
expenditure of both funds and physical labor.</p>

<h3>NEW BUSINESS</h3>

<h2>Plans for 1998</h2>

<p>We intend to participate in scheduled MEMA exercises on the second Tuesday of each
month throughout the year.&nbsp; In the spring we anticipate assisting with communications
for the Parklawn Classic foot race.&nbsp; A Clinical Center Power Outage test will
probably be held in May.&nbsp; </p>

<p>NIHRAC can expect to assist the PHS-1 DMAT at anytime to make ready their radio
equipment.&nbsp; For example, they may deploy to assist in the recovery effort following
the recent disastrous ice storm in the northeastern U.S.&nbsp; A second Clinical Center
power outage test is planned for the early fall.&nbsp; As noted above, we have already
been asked to provide our services as communicators to the B-CC YMCA for the Thanksgiving
Day Turkey Chase 10 k foot race. We expect to continue developing our skills and
capabilities, especially in the area of digital communication.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Nominating Committee</h2>

<p>According to the NIHRAC Constitution, &quot;Candidates for election as officers shall
be placed in nomination at the February meeting and shall be elected at the March
meeting&quot;.&nbsp; Thus, the NIHRAC president appointed a Nominating Committee
consisting of Dan Reggia, Andy Mitz and Bill Hook.&nbsp; They will present a slate of
candidates at the February meeting and additional nominations will be accepted then. </p>

<h2>Adjournment</h2>

<p>The meeting was adjourned at 110 p.m.</p>

<h1 align="center">NIHRAC 1997 YEAR END SUMMARY</h1>

<p>K3YGG Packet/Internet Gateway While it was actually in late 1996 that Jeff Johnson
N3NPQ donated a temporary connection to the Internet via telephone, it was not until last
year that we got the fiber optic connection to the NIH network.&nbsp; This has permitted
users to take advantage of many features and capabilities of the BBS that were previously
unavailable. Other improvements to the system include a new KAM+ dual port HF/VHF TNC, a
resulting HF port on 80M, which allows direct connection to the system from several
hundred miles away, software updates, routing updates, hardware additions, and user
command improvements.&nbsp; Here is a list of some of the features that the system now
offers </p>

<p>1. outgoing and incoming e-mail service, including capability of&nbsp; mail delivery
right to your house,</p>

<p>2. connections to other packet/Internet gateways around the&nbsp;world, </p>

<p>3. &quot;real time&quot; callbook server (using the command &quot;cb&quot;),</p>

<p>4. connectivity to k3ygg by telnet from remote systems (no packet station req'd),</p>

<p>5. connectivity to remote systems by telnet from k3ygg,</p>

<p>6. time-saving mailing lists that distribute mail to club members quickly, and</p>

<p>7. 19.2 KBd SLIP link to &quot;rockmd&quot; (4-port wide-coverage packet system).</p>

<p>Although we actually have few NIHRAC club members using the system, we get about a
dozen or so connections daily from the DC area and beyond.&nbsp; I've received about half
a dozen thank-you notes from them in the last few months. The system is even giving e-mail
service to several hams in Pennsylvania, one of whom doesn't have a telephone. I'll keep
maintaining and improving the system in 1998, and welcome suggestions from users and club
members.&nbsp; Thanks to everyone who helped in 1997.</p>

<h2>Establishment of High-speed Network Access for ECC</h2>

<p>In addition to the TCP/IP packet radio/Internet gateway described above by Jim, we now
have</p>

<p>- a club web page,</p>

<p>- computers at the ECC for member's use,</p>

<p>- a Unix server for ECC and club activities, and</p>

<p>- an Internet radio receiver, a prelude to an Internet satellite station.</p>

<h2>Notes on the Web Page</h2>

<p>Current status installed on a borrowed computer until the Club's Unix server is back in
service.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The main NIHRAC Web page is very simple.&nbsp; It provides an overview of the club, a
detailed list of club activities/ projects, and access to the minutes from the most recent
club meeting.&nbsp; It links to a series of pages on emergency preparedness.&nbsp; These
pages were developed by Rip Smith K3XO, the original author of the NIHRAC Web pages.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>An important part of the club Web site is the Amateur Radio Listening Post.&nbsp; This
Web page allows you to control a VHF/UHF receiver from the Internet, and listen to the
receiver via the Internet.&nbsp; The NIHRAC Listening Post Web page is described in the
February 1998 issue of QST on pages 48-51.</p>

<p>We are always looking for people to improve the Web site.&nbsp; Right now it could use
a little glitz!</p>

<p>-- Andy Mitz</p>

<h2>MEMA </h2>

<p>MEMA is an acronym for The Maryland Emergency Management Agency. Their communication
exercises are called &quot;COMMEX&quot; and these nets are held on the 2nd Tuesday evening
of each month unless there is a state recognized holiday when it is held one week
later.&nbsp; In line with NIHRAC's commitment to emergency communications, this activity
has been a regular part of the club program for more than 25 years and has evolved into
establishing NIHRAC as a backup to Montgomery County's participation.</p>

<p>The net uses several modes and several frequencies.&nbsp; The state-wide net checks in
on the 147.150 (Davidsonville) repeater. Prior to the COMMEX we check radio communication
with the Rockville&nbsp; EOC on either simplex or repeater frequencies in the 144, 220 and
440 MHz amateur bands.&nbsp; Contact is also made with MEMA Pikesville using a non-amateur
143 MHz frequency. </p>

<p>There is sometimes a 75 meter SSB net (MEPN) accepting COMMEX messages. For several
months we passed routine traffic via packet using TCP/IP.&nbsp; We have also used the
NIHRAC 145.29 MHz repeater to send FM voice message traffic to Pikesville - so we know
that our repeater with its emergency back-up power supply will serve in times of
emergency. MEMA has recently requested that we send routine administrative messages by
fax.&nbsp; We will be able to do this if we can acquire a surplus fax machine. The MEMA
net starts at 1930 local time and ends around 2030. All NIHRAC members are encouraged to
participate and to become familiar with message handling procedures and the operation of
the equipment in the ECC.&nbsp; Among the members who have participated at the ECC in 1997
are Joel Harding KE3YK, Bob Haslack N3FRT, Bill Hook W3QBC, John Muller W3QF, Chuck
Sherman</p>

<p>N3WTO, and Harold Simon N3PXK. </p>

<h2>PHS-1 DMAT</h2>

<p>NIHRAC members assisted the DMAT in preparing for the deployments to Fort Pickett June
7-21 and to Fort A.P. Hill July 24-August 1.&nbsp; For the latter event, several NIHRAC
members dedicated a significant effort toward establishing contact with the team on 75
meters.&nbsp; In November we installed additional frequencies in DMAT's 10 Motorola
JT-1000 HTs, 3 Bendix-King HTs and one Bendix-King mobile transceiver.&nbsp; NIHRAC also
undertook the shipment and receipt of 3 defective JT-1000s to Transcrypt International for
repair under warranty.</p>

<h2>NIH Clinical Center</h2>

<p>The NIHRAC affiliation with the NIH CC is as strong as it has ever been. We have
provided first class communications service every time we&nbsp; have been called upon to
help.&nbsp; In return, the NIH CC Safety office has provided both financial and important
political support for our computer networks. Turnout of NIHRAC members to support the
Clinical Center has been outstanding.&nbsp; For the April 12 power outage we had 11
members present, 9 volunteers at the October 4 outage and 9 members were on hand for the
October 18 Life Safety Tour that was held during working hours. Thanks are due to the
following for dedicating their time and talents to the Clinical Center:</p>

<p>Rick Dessel WN3T, Aaron Hartman KA3GSV, Bob Haslach N3FRT, Jim Hobbs AA3DN, Bill Hook,
W3QBC, Jeff Johnson N3NPQ, Mike Kahn, KA3GSV, Quin Marsh N3KGM, Andy Mitz WA3LTJ, Ross
Merlin WA2WDT, John Muller W3QF, Frank Putnam N3ZPQ, Chuck Sherman N3WTO, Walter Stewart
WM3Z, Al Taylor KN3U, Mike Thomas WB3LHT and Larry Wolken N3OJD. </p>
