<h3>Radio equipment</h3>

<p>NIHRAC has an emergency communications center (ECC) with a wide range of communications
gear. Currently, there are five operating positions and a workbench in one room, and an
adjacent meeting room. Three of the 5 operating positions are complete HF stations, each
with transceiver, station monitor, KW amplifier, straight and electronic keys, multiple
headphone jacks, and clock. Two stations have phone patches. Each station is completely
contained in a rolling rack mount with integral lighting. The fourth operating position is
a UHF/VHF multiradio/multiband station. The fifth and newest position is a multiband
TCP/IP packet and internet communications desk. </p>

<h3>Computing equipment</h3>

<p>NIHRAC now has three computer systems on the internet. One is a general server,
including FTP, www, and Samba services, it runs the Linux operating system. One is a
TCP/IP packet station that operates as an internet/packet radio gateway, it runs JNOS. The
third computer is for members to access internet sites as users, this computer runs
Windows 95. Internet connection is via a high-speed backbone on the od.nih.gov domain.</p>
