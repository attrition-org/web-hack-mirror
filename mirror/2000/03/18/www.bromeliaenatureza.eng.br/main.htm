something funny to say.......1 fux0red y0r h0n3y and h3r m0m <HR></I></CENTER></H5>

<P><I>NO ONE TOUCHES MY HONEY!!! &gt;=] Hi guys. It's p4ntera
from ph33r the b33r, and i have something to say:</I></P>

<P><I>Yesterday, a very popular website known as cyberarmy was
hit with a injunction.</I></P>

<P><I>According to a member of antioffline, sil, DoS attacks were
launched against him by members of the so called &quot;cyberarmy&quot;.
His personal info was also released on the cyberarmy webboard,
which made him push for legal action. I was told that someone
found out his company, and launched many mailbombs effectivly
DoS'ng the server and shutting it down for a period or 2.</I></P>

<P><I>Then sil fucked up.</I></P>

<P><I>From what i was told, he also packeted someone from the
Deliquent Hacking Corporation, DDoS style. Instead of just packeting
him knocking him offline, he took down a whole subnet. This created
yet another mix up in this &quot;hacker war&quot;.</I></P>

<P><I>It was resolved today.</I></P>

<P><I>I am glad this shit was resolved. Cyberarmy became a good
part of me learning on how to hack and met very good and nice
people. Antioffline is a very funny page, and i agree with them
whole-heartdly that JP needs a good kick in this ass. I am glad
this shit got fixed up, i didnt want to see a fight.</I></P>

<P><I>Congrats and shoutz to:</I></P>

<P><I>Nick : good job fixing this shit up. I enjoy visiting your
page. And shhhhh dont tell anyone ;)</I></P>

<P><I>sil: im glad to see you came to your senses. good job buddy,
i hope u and me are cool</I></P>

<P><I>Drkplague: werd! :)</I></P>

<H5><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">admin: I am very sorry this happened
to your box. Don't blame yourself, it was the hosting company.
I patched the whole and you shouldn't be hacked anymore. If u
have any questions/comments, email </FONT><A HREF="mailto:%20p4ntera@beer.com">me</A></H5>

<H5><FONT COLOR="#00ff00">Shoutz to people on attrition with skill:<BR>
DHC, kryptec, COTDS, tr1pl3 s31s, bansh33 (has gone whitehat.
:[ ) Team Echo (RIP), DD, all of the newly reformed gH, wkD, ka0x
and one mad shout to ADM! Kick JP's fucking ass! &gt;=]</FONT></H5>

<H5><FONT COLOR="#00ffff">Major shoutz to those who have always
stood by ph33r the b33r, when we were starting out.</FONT></H5>

<H5><FONT COLOR="#00ffff">Some people have asked me &quot;Why
the defacements?&quot;. Well as i said in the past, i am here
to bring back old skool hacking. Most of the kids on attrition
don't know what its like to work months and months on a sploit,
to finally get that beautifal # prompt. People have also said
that im a &quot;script kiddie&quot; and &quot;i am not better
then those kids on attrition&quot;. Well, i agree to a point.
2 wrongs dont make a right.</FONT></H5>

<H5><FONT COLOR="#00ffff">But when it comes to the script kiddie
thing, i would disagree slightly. On these hacks i have been using
a &quot;0-day&quot; input validation attack. By inputing a set
of commands and determining on a port, i can get whatever i want
from the target system. Now, if i can remember, the definition
of a script kiddie is a person who uses predetermined &quot;scripts&quot;
to &quot;hack&quot; into a system and gain root. I haven't used
one script for these hacks, so i guess i ain't a script kiddie.
Next question :)</FONT></H5>

<H5><FONT COLOR="#ff9f71">I would also like to shout out to my
bestest buddy Ana|og. Thanks man, without your help, i would be
/fucked right now. Don't worry bro, I always got your back.</FONT></H5>

<H5><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Also i would like to shout out to #routed,
and MHA. MHA, sorry for the trouble that came before. Lets resolve
this shit.</FONT></H5>
