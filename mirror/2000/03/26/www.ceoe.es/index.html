<p>hola mi amigos, (fjeer the spanish skillz)</p>

<p>here i am once again... get to know me... know to like me...
why do people hack? to voice opinions. to show their skills. most
of us are merely kids. this is a way to show our knowledge. to
show our mentors and teachers, that we are smarter. we are the
future. you cant hold us down. we dont want to go to school. we
dont want to learn algebra and communication skills. we dont want
to be teased and ridiculed. ever wonder why kids go fucking crazy
and shoot 23 of their classmates? think real hard</p>

<p>werd to xhn, ninja, ph33r the b33rand all the mother fuckers
that told me i couldnt.</p>

<p>special werd to Pakistan Hackerz Club. keep doin what your
doin.</p>

<p>i love you jody</p>
