<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#00CC00">000h....did I defacement
with someone. Kinda cool, working with another person. Must be cool to
be in a group:) Anyways, know-it.com, i guess you now KNOW that you were
hax0red. I think that the only thing you guys don't "know" is about computer
security. What else is new? And once again.....those of you who are mailing
me telling me that I don't have skill, etc etc. Incase you don't actually
READ my defacements, not even in 1 have I claimed to have any type of skill
or anything. I do code though and hopefully will have something released
in the near future (security scanner or something).</FONT></FONT>
