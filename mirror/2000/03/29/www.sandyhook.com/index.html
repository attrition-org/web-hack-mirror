<FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">This defacement
was done because I have a few things to say about 2600. Well of course,
if you don't already know from reading HNN, 2600 registered fucknbc.com
pointing it to nbc.com. Now, I, for one, think that is extroadinaryly lame.
It seems to me like ever since Mitnick was released, 2600 has nothing anymore,
so they are creating something for publicity which seems like that's all
they want. Let's not forget that DeCSS bullshit. This is for you 2600:&nbsp;
I had somewhat of a respect for you guys but lately you guys have just
been one big publicity stunt. Stop trying to get publicity because the
way you are doing it is lame and not right.</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"></FONT></FONT>
