<font color = "yellow"><p> Everyday, whether it be on tv or at my school, or in my community,
or anywhere, i see more and more examples of the government taking over
and controlling the land and people. I know there isn't anything i can do
about it. Police holding people prisoner without a logical cause. People
being raided that don't even have a computer. Animals being killed because
they are homeless. Constant suicides and homocides because everyone is against
one another. And we ask ourselves why the world can be so cruel. We ask ourselves
why we are even put here on this earth. I don't know the answer. I don't even
know the reason. All i know is that we are here together and we will eventually
die together. Earth has treated us good. But the government is trying to control
the earth and its resources along with the people that share them because of covert
power and conspiracies. i could deface a quiwillion sites and i couldn't do anything
harmful to anybody. Its all artifical in case everyone forgot. The real crimes
are those of rapists, murderers, and the law enforcement that is supposedly protecting
us from all of this. One day, maybe in a decade, or maybe in a few centuries, the
world will know whats going on behind its back when its too late. Its kinda like
being able to see for about 15 seconds after your head is chopped off. You will be able
to see how fucked up everything is, but you will be powerless and helpless to do shit
about it. I have been in .gov sites and i have actually read some whack shit about
Russia and the US thats going on right now. No telling what other shit is going
on. What i am tryin to say is that all of us cybernerds are alike. We all thirst for knowledge.
Not knowledge that we can get from a public library or an encyclopedia. We are the anarchists
who seek knowledge that is hidden from us. If we don't unite and work as an underground team,
then all of our skills and talents are useless. Whether your a hacker, a nerd, an avenger, an
anarchist, or just a normal human being, don't let the government control you. We must be prepared,
and organized, because if W.W. ]|[ occurs, and it will eventually, the world is gonna be in nuclear 
warfare, and no one will be able to stop the end.
