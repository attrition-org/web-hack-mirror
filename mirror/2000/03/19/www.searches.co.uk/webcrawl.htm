<p align="center">Webcrawler is one of my favorite search engines. They present the
information in a short form or long form that is efficient. Nice fast response too. The
simple interface belies the fact that you can do some <a
href="http://webcrawler.com/WebCrawler/Help/Advanced.html">advanced searching</a> also. If
that seems complicated, maybe it would be simpler if you could look at some <a
href="http://webcrawler.com/WebCrawler/Help/Examples.html">examples.</a> There are also
ways you can <a href="http://webcrawler.com/WebCrawler/Help/ImproveResults.html">improve
your results</a>. A description of the <a
href="http://webcrawler.com/WebCrawler/Help/Results.html#Guide">results returned</a> is
also provided. When you <a href="http://webcrawler.com/WebCrawler/SubmitURLS.html">add a
URL,</a> they seem to be better at getting URLs up on their service more quickly than most
other engines. WebCrawler also allows you to <a
href="http://www.webcrawler.com/WebCrawler/Status.html">check if a URL is currently in its
database</a>, and if so, when it was last visited by their web spider. Another neat
feature is that WebCrawler let's you check out <a
href="http://www.webcrawler.com/WebCrawler/Links.html">who links to your web pages.</a>
Problem with this though, is that you have to check each individual page's URL address. If
you have hundreds of pages, as we do, this can be a formidable task. It's too bad they
don't allow you to enter the site address and give you a list of all links to it as <a
href="altavist.htm">Alta Vista</a> does. Webcrawler also presents <a
href="http://webcrawler.com/select/">GNN's Best of the Net</a>, a hierarchical directory
that is discriminating. This page features <a
href="http://webcrawler.com/select/nunu.new.html">what's new</a> this week and <a
href="http://webcrawler.com/select/top.new.html">what's hot,</a> which are the fifty most
accessed links (not websites) in GNN Select from the previous week. Webcrawler is provided
by <a href="http://gnn.com/">Global Network Navigator (GNN)</a>. (5/26/96) </p>
