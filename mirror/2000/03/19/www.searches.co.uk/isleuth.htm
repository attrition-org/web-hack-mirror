<p align="center">Internet Sleuth is a new parallel meta-search engine which is still
under development, but it works very well as is and it is extremely fast. You may search
up to 10 search engines out of 13 at once. We have selected 10 of these search engines as
defaults, but you can change them and make your own multiple selections by holding down
your control key as you click on your choices. You will also be pleased to find that the
search results are presented without all those commercials - the banner ads have been
stripped from the pages. The developers say they are doing a complete re-write and promise
major improvements. They also warn the user to keep the searches simple, preferably to one
word, because each of the included search engines have different ways of parsing search
strings and a complex request might nullify your search with certain engines. I tried
several multiple word searches and was pleased with the results. This caution points out
the possible problems of using mulitple search engines simultaneously. If in doubt, go to
the search interface for the individual search engines included here in<a
href="default.htm"> Eureka!</a> The Internet Sleuth also offers the most comprehensive
collection of searchable internet directories and databases on the internet. They have
over 1,500 search engines that you can easily locate through a well organized hierarchical
list on their <a href="http://www.isleuth.com/">home page</a>. When you select a subject
area it takes you to a Internet Sleuth engine similar to the one found on this page where
you can select up to 10 databases concerning your subject area. If you have a web site
that has a search engine that uses the GET method you may <a
href="http://www.isleuth.com/sl-form.html">submit</a> your engine for inclusion in the
Internet Sleuth. This service is brought to you by <a href="http://www.intbc.com/">Internet
Business Connection</a>. (7/29/96) </p>
