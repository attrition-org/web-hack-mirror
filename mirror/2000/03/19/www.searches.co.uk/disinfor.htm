<p align="center">DisInformation is a search engine with a twist. It is the first of a new
genre of search engines that focuses on a special topic or interest. In this case the
focus is on &quot;current affairs, politics, new science and the 'hidden information,'
that seldom seems to slip through the cracks of the corporate owned media
conglomerates.&quot; It is a search engine with a counterculture bias and seeks to provide
its users with information that is difficult or impossible to find in the mainstream
media. This is a search engine for the rebel with a cause and for those who like to wade
through the deep waters of current issues. Don't search for anything or everything here.
DisInformation is an inch wide and a mile deep. If you reach beyond its narrow focus, you
are likely to find nothing, but it is a goldmine in its niche. It highlights hot subjects
of the day in six categories which are hotlinked above beneath the search form. The
principal links are hand picked for &quot;quality&quot; and some sites are reviewed and/or
recommended. Sites are also rated and awarded &quot;hand-grenades&quot; for how worthwhile
the editorial staff feels they are.. The search engine is powered by Alta Vista, but their
server appears to be a bit underpowered in that I found responses to searches to be slow.
The developers provide information <a
href="http://www.disinfo.com/gen/gen_aboutdisinfo.html">About Disinformation</a> and show
more of what they are about in their <a href="http://www.disinfo.com/toc/toc.html">Table
of Contents</a>. You can also find out who gets <a
href="http://www.disinfo.com/cre/cre.html">Credit</a> for this innovation. This search
engine also invites you to <a href="http://www.disinfo.com/gen/gen_becomemember.html">Join
Our Club</a> (mailing list) and they aren't shy about sharing their <a
href="http://www.disinfo.com/gen/gen_editorialpolicy.html">Editorial Policy</a> with you.
This is a search engine with an attitude, and if you don't like it you can send <a
