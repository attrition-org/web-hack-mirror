<p align="center">Yahoo! People Search is Yahoo's entry into the telephone book race. The
database is provided by <a href="http://www.Four11.com/">Four11 Corporation</a>, but it is
not the same as the one available directly from Four11 and appears to contain less
information then the source supplier. Yahoo does not state the number of listings in this
directory. Yahoo appears to be going in the direction of integrating this service with web
pages in its main <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/People/">Yahoo People Home
Pages</a>, but its not integrated enough now for us to put those items on this page. They
are simply links at the time of this writing. You can go directly to those services by
clicking on the links in this paragraph. Yahoo does not have a way for users to add their
phone numbers or their websites to this database at the time of this writing. If you are
concerned about your <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/docs/info/people_privacy.html">privacy</a>,
you can request that your listing be <a href="mailto:people-remove@yahoo.com">surpressed</a>.
If you'd like to know how they did this, you should check their <a
href="http://www.yahoo.com/docs/info/people_faq.html">FAQ</a>. You may also request a <a
href="mailto:people-change@yahoo.com">change</a> to your listing. Database America offers
a competive service called <a href="people.htm">People Finder</a> which appears to be more
comprehensive than Yahoo's People Search or the Four11 service and it retrieves and
displays more data. (8/12/96) </p>
