<p align="center">BigBook does some great things today and promises to do more later.
BigBook contains a database of 11 million Yellow Page business phone numbers and
addresses. I had trouble finding some businesses, including my own, so I suspect that the
information is not completely current or accurate. I'm not surprised because I haven't
found one of these yellow pages services to be so. The great thing about BigBook is that
it will create maps for you showing the location of the business you found. As of this
writing, this is an advanced version and many of its features have not been implemented.
The submission of URLs and the creation of free home pages looks like it's working, but
they still don't show the submissions I made several weeks ago. This promises to be a very
good service when all the parts are there and working. Right now you'll have to settle for
its nice and pretty maps. If you would like to create your own custom maps or get
directions or distances from here to there, I suggest you check out some really cool stuff
on this <a href="weat1_sj.htm">page</a> of the Silicon Valley Web Directory. (4/25/96) <!--/lthide--> </p>
