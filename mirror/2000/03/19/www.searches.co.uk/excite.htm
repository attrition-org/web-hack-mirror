<p align="center">Excite claims to have more than 11.5 million web pages indexed. This is
a little more than half as many as Alta Vista, but still one of the larger repositories of
web pages on the net. Excite distinguishes itself from the other engines by having reviews
of over 50,000 websites. Magellan comes up second with about 30,000 reviews. You can also
search 10,000 newsgroups with Excite out of a total of about 20,000. I believe Alta Vista
and Deja News both cover more newsgroups and articles. Excite uses a <a
href="http://corp.excite.com/spider.html">spider</a> to find information about websites.
One of the best features of Excite is its excellent relevancy rankings which is one of the
finest I've seen. Displays of results are also clear and very readable, but lacking the
website's URL. Excite uses a &quot;unique concept search technology&quot; to search and
summarize websites in addition to keywords. Searches can be made on concepts or keywords.
I really can't see much difference between the two, or much benefit of the concept search.
A description of their <a href="http://www.excite.com/advanced.query.html">Advanced Query
Language</a> is available as are answers to <a href="http://www.excite.com/FAQ.html">Frequently
Asked Questions</a>. I would not characterize the Advanced Query as very advanced, nor
particularly effective. A powerful feature of this engine is its <a
href="http://www.excite.com/FAQ.html#anchor5726863">Query by Example</a> capability. Just
click on the button next to the best result and it will find more similar websites. Excite
also has a <a href="http://www.excite.com/Subject/">directory of its NetReviews</a>.
Excite owns another directory called <a href="http://www.city.net/">city.net</a> that
contains information on over 2,100 cities. You can <a
href="http://www.excite.com/cgi/comsubhelp.cgi?display=html;path=/query.html;section=search;Suggest+Link=Suggest+Link">submit
a URL</a> to Excite. Excite seems to update its database fairly frequently and is more
current than most robot based search engines. Excite uses the number of links it finds to
a site as a factor in gathering information and also uses postings to &quot;what's
new&quot; locations. A <a href="http://corp.excite.com/company.html">company profile</a>
and a <a href="http://corp.excite.com/live.html">live video camera </a>of Excite
Corporation are also there. (5/1/96) </p>
