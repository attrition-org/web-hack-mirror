<p align="center">If you are in a rush to find information, and the internet's not too
busy at the time, the first place to go is SavvySearch. This search engine will search
five other search engines simultaneously and promptly return the results. You can specify
that the results be reported for each search engine or that the results be consolidated
with all duplicates eliminated. This takes a little longer up front, but saves you the
time of looking at all the duplicate sites returned. SavvySearch will select the first
five engines to search using a <a href="http://wagner.cs.colostate.edu:1969/">search plan</a>
and presents you with a choice of search plans for the remaining fourteen of the nineteen
search engines it queries. <a href="http://wagner.cs.colostate.edu:1969/help/#plan">Search
Plan Help</a> assists you in selecting the plan(s) to use. SavvySearch is a good way to
get a look at a lot of fast results at once. SavvySearch's query interface is a simple
basic query . But if all you ever do are simple searches, it might be all you'll ever
need. SavvySearch has three output options which present the results in very good formats.
Due to its popularity, it is best to use it in off hours in the evenings and on the
weekends. A good list of answers is provided to <a
href="http://wagner.cs.colostate.edu:1969/faq/">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.
SavvySearch <a href="http://wagner.cs.colostate.edu:1969/help/">Help</a> provides a nice
detailed description of its query options. In addition to the English language version,
SavvySearch is also available in <a
href="http://wagner.cs.colostate.edu:1969/faq/#languages">fourteen other languages</a>.
