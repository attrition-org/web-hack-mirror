<p align="center">Yahoo is the most famous and, possibly, the most popular internet search
engine. It's the engine most beginners start with, and it is a good start for newbies. It
also has some strong features for the expert searcher. Above all else, Yahoo is a
hierarchical directory. This means everything in it is categorized and organized in some
logical fashion. It is easy to dig deep into this tree structure whether you start with
the mother tree itself on the home page or you start with a search and arrive somewhere
out on a limb. The value added of a directory like this is the organization of similar
things in one place. The drawback of this is that it is difficult for website owners to
contribute to more than one category. This means that complex websites are not going to be
well represented in the various categories it covers and many gems of information they
contain cannot be revealed by Yahoo. Another drawback is that it can take months for a
site to get listed and sometimes they don't get listed for any apparent reason. Yahoo
generally covers the major single subject sites well. In addition to its simple query
interface, Yahoo has a more powerful screening capability hidden behind the options on its
search page. Those options are all available on this page. If a subject is important to
you, you should also search elsewhere. Yahoo makes it somewhat easy to do that also by
providing direct links on its pages to other major search engines. A <a

Reuters is also offered. Yahoo provides a list of other <a

can be found in <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/docs/info/help.html">Yahoo! Help</a>. Yahoo
also provides an excellent <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/docs/info/faq.html">FAQ</a> that
provides information from the basics of the internet up to the very specific Yahoo
details. I could not find a web page with information about the </p>
