<p align="center">The World Wide Web Worm search interface is simple, uncomplicated, and
not nearly as effective as many other search engines. The database produced by this robot
is not very large and it does not seem to be updated very frequently, if at all. You may <a
href="http://guano.cs.colorado.edu/home/mcbryan/WWWWadd.html">register your URL</a> with
the Worm but don't hold your breath waiting for it to call on your site. The performance
of this engine is very slow. Long waits or no response at all can be expected from the
overworked server. This is a small and antiquated engine which is not being enhanced and
just doesn't compare to the professionally maintained and well funded newer search
engines. The engine has about 3 million documents index. Retrieval can be very fast when
the machine is not overloaded. Best to do late evening searches with this engine. An
oddity of this engine is that it displays GIF images when found in a listing. Instructions
and definitions are available in a <a
href="http://guano.cs.colorado.edu/home/mcbryan/WWWWintro.html#instr">FAQ</a>. Since this
engine stores only URLs and Titles, very large search results can be obtained quickly. One
of the few search engines that will allow you to request 5,000 hits. Good search engine
for retrieving a large number of URLs by doing a search on the domain name. This is one of
the earliest search engines on the web, but it has seen better days when there wasn't so
much competition around. The WWW Worm was developed by <a

professor of computer science at the University of Colorado at Boulder. (5/2/96) </p>
