<p>InfoSeek Guide is one of the best internet search engines on the web. Infoseek
maintains its database of websites as well as anybody and they are fairly quick when you
submit an URL. It is fast and very comprehensive. It is simple to use and the information
is returned in an attractive and easy to understand format.Web FAQs and categories are
also available for searching. You can <a
href="http://www.infoseek.com/AddUrl?pg=DCaddurl.html">add, change, or remove</a> the
listing of your website in InfoSeek. They provide a good general <a
href="http://www.infoseek.com/Help?pg=Contents.html">guide to searching</a> their
databases and also some fine <a
href="http://guide.infoseek.com/Help?pg=SearchHelp.html&amp;sv=IS&amp;lk=noframes">search
tips</a>. And if that's not enough, InfoSeek provides one of the best <a
href="http://guide.infoseek.com/Help?pg=DChelp.html&amp;sv=IS&amp;lk=noframes">help</a>
pages I have seen provided by a search engine. Another powerful feature is the capability
to find all of the specific URLs that are indexed in Ultraseek with this search parameter,
&quot;url:best.com/~mentorms&quot; and to be able to locate all of the pages with links to
a specific URL that are indexed in Ultraseek with this search parameter (the &quot;-
URL&quot; excludes your pages), &quot;+link:best.com/~mentorms
-url:best.com/~mentorms&quot;. The search engine is extremely fast. Infoseek claims that
search times are independent of the size of their database. If true, Ultraseek will run
circles around just about every other engine. The output is formatted in a clean very
readable format that looks very much like Alta Vista's output. Unlike Alta Vista,
Ultraseek does not print the date of acquisition of the URL that I find to be very useful.
A useful comparison of Inforseek's <a

six other major search engines is here also. Information is available <a
