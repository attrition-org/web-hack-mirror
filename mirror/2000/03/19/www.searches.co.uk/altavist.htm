<p align="center">Alta Vista is a unique robot in that it has the largest database of web
pages, over 31 million pages on more than 225,000 servers at last count. It is not only
the most comprehensive collection of web pages. Alta Vista is the first search engine to
use if you are looking for an obscure or arcane subject. But because of its immense size
and coverage, it can also return a large amount of &quot;garbage&quot; which you must wade
through to find the gems of information when you search a popular subject. You can get <a
href="http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=h&amp;what=web">help for simple
queries</a> and <a
href="http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=ah&amp;what=web">help for advanced
queries</a>. Information <a href="http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=about">about
Alta Vista</a> is also provided. You can easily <a
href="http://www.altavista.digital.com/av/content/addurl.htm">add URLs</a> to this
service, or you can also <a
href="http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/robots.html">exclude their robot</a>
from indexing your website as described on the same page. Alta Vista has a <a
href="http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=s&amp;what=web">small directory</a>
that consist of a few links to a variety of catalogues. This directory looks like it was
thrown together at the last minute as an afterthought. Another unique and special aspect
of Alta Vista is that it can find many of the websites that have links to another specific
website. For example, you can enter your website's full URL and it will provide you with a
list of many of the website's that link to your home page. There is also a special way to
find people by name. Both features are described on Alta Vista's <a
href="http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=tips">tips page</a>. If
interested, you can buy your own copy of the <a
