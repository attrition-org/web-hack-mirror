<p align="center">Open Text claims to have as many pages indexed as Lycos, but they don't
state any quantity. They also claim to update their database continuously, adding or
updating 50,000 pages a day, but they also don't show the date of acquisition of web pages
so one cannot determine how current the search results are. The search interface is simple
and returns results that are ranked with reasonably good relevancy. A power search option
is available to refine searches. Open Text indexes every word on every page it indexes.
Open Text also provides an interesting page called <a
href="http://www.opentext.com/docs/webpulse/webpulse.html"><i>WebPulse! The Internet
Traffic Report</i></a> that reveals the most found pages from the previous day's searches.
You can <a href="http://index.opentext.net/main/submitURL.html">add your pages</a> to Open
Text, but their robot does not index websites so you must add the URL for every single
page you want to have indexed. Open Text promises to include your submission within two
weeks. Open text also has a <a href="http://www.jp.opentext.com/">Japanese Index Search</a>.
There is information about <a href="http://www.opentext.com/corp/otm_about.html">Open Text
Corporation</a> on the site. (7/31/96)</p>
