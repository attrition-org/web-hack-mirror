<P><I>Hey malory davis, my name is p4ntera and i had fun walking
in and our of your system. Before i start ranting, i didn't delete
anything and i backed up the original index. j00r w3lc0m3 :)</I></P>

<P><I>Now, /*begin ranting</I></P>

<P><I>The future of the underground has forever changed. There
are more whitehats around then there ever was. I can say this
was because of the major hacks last year. I cannot complain with
this, if I had been arrested i would have turned whitehat too.
So mosthated,secto0r,bansh33 and the rest of the whitehats i know/respect,
don't take it offensely when I say this, cause u guys went through
a lot of bullshit last year.</I></P>

<P><I>But I am sick of whitehats ruining it for the rest of us.
I was told that going whitehat is being a true hacker, by not
being malicious. Well, fuck that. I say being hacker is looking
behind the scenes of whats really going on, or seeing what others
cannot. This, to me, is what being a hacker REALLY is all about.
Not listening to the horseshit the mass media spews forth, or
being told what to think. Me and my friends were the first people
to doubt the FBI knew who DDoS'd those site, and we were right.
In fact, i had bets going (300$ :] ). Have they caught them? No,
of course not.</I></P>

<P><I>And i know i wasn't the only one. I knew that the FBI had
no idea, and still don't, who the fuck did that shit to ebay,yahoo
and amazon. It's impossible. from what i heard, 1000's of boxen
were used to contribute to that attack. How is it possible to
figure out who did it? Could u find a person, in a mall, without
even know what they looked like or anything about them? lol of
course not. Its the media, and i'm sick of them.</I></P>

<P>*/end rant</P>
