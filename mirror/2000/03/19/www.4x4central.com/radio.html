<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+2>Everyone
already uses a C.B. so why do I need Amateur Radio?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Range and versatility are
the biggest advantages. A C.B. radio is normally limited to line of site
contacts, which means that hills buildings, and even the curvature of the
earth can all be limiting factors to the range of your transmissions. Amateur
Radio operators or "Hams" have the added advantage of using repeaters to
increase the range of reliable contacts.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Repeaters can be located
on mountain tops, tall buildings or tall free standing towers. Your signal
is sent from your location, to the repeater and is instantaneously retransmitted
from the repeater location over a wide spread area. This can be extremely
helpful when four wheeling or camping in remote locations. Some repeaters
have autopatch capabilities, which means you can make telephone calls from
your radio. There are thousands of amateur radio repeaters located across
the country and they are often located on top of the mountain ranges we
do our wheelin' in.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>High Frequency amateur radio
equipment (HF) is capable of communicating with stations anywhere in the
world using voice, Morse code, Slow Scan TV and many other modes of communications.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>With a "packet radio" a GPS
unit and&nbsp; APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System) software, you can
keep track of vehicles on a moving map, transmitting the information to
any number of monitoring stations. Hams have used this system for years
while providing communications assistance for bike races, walkathons and
parades.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Many Hams have installed
APRS in their vehicles as a vehicle locator system. When they leave their
vehicle they turn the system on and the system sends out a "packet burst"
every few minutes. Hams have called their local police and told them that
there car has been stolen and then they tell the police exactly where it's
located. This system was in place before LOJACK.</FONT></FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+2>Do
I need a license to operate a Amateur Radio station?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>YES! A license is a must,
but don't worry there is no longer a requirement to learn Morse code and
the theory for the written test can be learned by many people over a weekend
or two. The Technician license permits you to use all VHF/UHF amateur radio
frequencies, use transmitters capable of up to 1500 watts output, use satellites
for re-transmitting your signal and many other privileges.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>In order to use the world
wide HF bands Morse Code is still required. The minimum requirement is
5 wpm for a Tech Plus license the maximum is 20 wpm for an Extra class
license.</FONT></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+2>What
type of equipment do I need?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>For a very capable package
that can be used while your offroad, I recommend a high power mobile unit
capable of at least 40 watts. A dual band mobile (VHF/UHF) with crossband
repeater capabilities is even more desirable because you can use the radio
in your own truck as a repeater while you are out hiking with a HT (handi-talkie).
HT's are low power units producing up to 7 watts output, which is why I
don't recommend them as your primary unit.</FONT></FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+2>I'm
interested how can I get more information?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B>
<CENTER>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Try to find an amateur radio
club in your area. Many Hams are already involved in four wheeling so if
there is a ham in your 4x4 club ask him to show you the ropes. The ARRL
(Amateur Radio Relay League) is a national organization for amateur radio
operators. Their website can provide you with much more <A HREF="http://www.arrl.org/">information</A>
about getting started.</FONT></FONT><BR>
