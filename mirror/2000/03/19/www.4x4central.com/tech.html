Ford Explorer Buildup</font></font></font>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+0>by Rick Horwitz</font></font></b>
<p><a href="expfullfrt.jpg"><img SRC="expfullfrtsml.jpg" ALT="click for larger image" BORDER=0 height=238 width=373></a></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In 1993 I was looking for a vehicle to
replace my '90 Mazda B2600, 4x4. I needed something that would allow me
to carry all of my photo gear and also my clients into the backcountry
of Arizona. I decided that the 1993 Ford Explorer XL fit my needs and would
make for an extremely trailworthy vehicle once a few well planned modifications
had been performed. The criteria I had was to keep it simple so I started
with a base 4-door Explorer XL equipped with manual locking hubs, manual
transfer case and a 5-speed manual transmission.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After purchasing my Explorer I drove it
completely stock for 3000 miles making sure everything worked as it should.
I turned the broken in Explorer over to Torrey Porter, at
<a href="#sources">FLY-N-HI</a>
Offroad Centers in Phoenix, Arizona to install an ARB Airlocker in the
rear and a limited slip differential in front. 4:56 gears were also added
at this point. Also installed at this time was a Trailmaster 4" suspension
lift with arched rear springs (instead of blocks).</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The first time I took the Explorer out
to the desert to see how it worked I had problems. I took the truck on
a trail that I was very familiar with and took some moguls fairly quickly.
After running the moguls and putting the suspension through<a href="exptilt.jpg"><img SRC="exptiltsml.jpg" ALT="Click for larger image" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 BORDER=0 height=221 width=250 align=LEFT></a>
it's full travel, the drop brackets for both front snubbers bent and deformed.
I went back to FLY-N-HI and told them that the stock brackets weren't going
to be strong enough for my needs. They directed me to their custom fabrication
shop FST (Fabrication Suspension Technology).&nbsp; At the Fab shop, Mark
Clay, who now appreciated my bonzai driving style, built a pair of snubber
brackets that were welded and braced to the frame. At the same time Mark
fabricated an upper mounting point for an additional <a href="frtsusplrg.jpg">shock</a>
on each front wheel. The lower shock mount is the stock mounting location
for the swaybar, which has been removed for less restricted wheel travel.
The dual shock setup really made a lot of difference in offroad driveability.
The extra shock really soaks up the bumps so I can now keep a steady pace
over the moguls with no problem.</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The mileage and changes have come very quickly
over the past five years, there are now over 115,000 miles on the truck.
I have changed the rear leaf springs back to stock mounting them above
the axle to gain under axle clearance when rock crawling, this was accomplised
by welding new spring perches to the top of the axle housing and fabricating
new rear shock mounts. An additional shock was also added to the rear at
the same time. The additional shock helped to offset the instability at
freeway speeds (65+) that occured after removing the rear swaybar.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">An additional ARB air compressor supplies
a 6 gallon air tank mounted between the rear frame rails. FST fabricated
a tire carrier /rear bumper which holds my 33x15" spare tire. The front
bumper/winch mount is by Smittybuilt and has been reinforced to handle
the 9000 lb. Ramsey winch. FST also fabricated a transmission mount that
has much less flex than stock but still has give to it. The stock mount
allowed the front u-joint to smack the floorboard&nbsp; in sand under full
throttle and also while climbing steep loose hills.</font>
<br><a href="radiusarms.jpg"><img SRC="radiusarmssml.jpg" ALT="FST radius arms" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 BORDER=0 height=168 width=300 align=LEFT></a>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;FST built the
<a href="ramp.html">extended
radius arms</a> to help increase wheel travel and driveability. Mark Clay
cut off the rear of the stock radius arms and extended them back nearly
twice their original length. The rear radius arm mounts are now welded
to the frame just forward of the transmission crossmember. A new crossmember
was also fabricated to replace the original stamped steel piece. This set
up has worked flawlessly for over 2 years now.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many people complain about the lack of
power with the 4.0 liter Ford but I think it’s well matched to the 33x12.50
BFG MT’s and the 4:56 gears. The engine doesn’t miss a beat and short of
towing I don’t see a problem with the stock motor. I did add a Hypertech
Power Module which extended the rpm range of the engine, improved the overall
driveability and eliminated the spark knock I was getting during the 100+
degree days in Phoenix. A K&amp;N airfilter and a custom "catback" exhaust
from <a href="#sources">Pro Dyno</a> in Tempe, Arizona helps the engine
breath freely.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The only Ford related problem I have had
with the truck is the transmission. Like many others I have had problems
with the Mazda built 5 speed. The transmission never gave out, but became
increasingly difficult to shift. Ford rebuilt the tranny once at 36,000
and again at 59,000. At about 90,000 miles I installed a factory new 5speed.
I kept the original tranny so I could rebuild it for future use.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many people have had their Mazda 5speed
manual transmission fail when the rubber plugs sealing the shift rails
dry out and allow all the fluid to escape suddenly. The rubber plugs can
be replaced with metal plugs of the <a href="tips.htm">correct size</a>.
Synthentic transmission fluids seem to extend the life of this transmission
as well. I have had good luck with Redline. Most importantly stay with
the Mercon/Dexron III type fluids and DO NOT use standard gear oil.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At about 85,000 miles I noticed cracks
occuring in the floorboards where the floor meets the firewall. The Explorer
has an extremely flexible frame with a large inflexible body. The Ranger,
which uses the same chassis design as the Explorer has the benefit of a
seperate cab and bed assembly. This allows free movement of the frame without
overly stressing the body.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The floor is not the only thing that has
cracked from the constant flexing. I have also cracked two AC evaporators.
The aluminium tube which enters the housing cracked in half two years in
a row. The rubber hose which extends from the compressor to the accumulator
is not flexible enough to handle the twisting of the engine and frame.
I am looking into having a longer custom hose made which would allow for
more flex and hopefully prevent the problem from happening again.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My plans for the future include a new front
bumper with integrated winch mount/skid plate and a beefy Ford 9" rear
axle. If I have anymore problems with my Dana 35 IFS, a Dana 44 IFS may
be installed. I have also been thinking about adding a supercharger kit,
but I haven't made a decision about which brand would be best. I also would
like to add a transfer case or a transmission with lower gearing if they
ever become available.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Living near Phoenix, we usually get to
take the truck out on the trails at least once a week for some serious
wheeling. It's only a short drive from my house to some great trails in
the Bradshaw Mountains and other excellant trails north of Phoenix.</font></td>
