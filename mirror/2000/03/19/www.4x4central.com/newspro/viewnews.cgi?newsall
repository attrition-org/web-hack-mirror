This is the template for all pages produced by viewnews.cgi. It should be a normal HTML page, like you'd
use in your site, except with the following "tags" in it. Note that the tags have had asterisks (*s) inserted
into them so that the script doesn't replace these examples with the content. Remove all *s
from these when actually using them.

<Insert*Title>  Inserts the title of the document
<Insert*Content> Inserts all the content - i.e. search results. This does NOT include necessary 
		HTML tags like <body>, you must insert these yourself as in this example.
