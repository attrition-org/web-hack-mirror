<hr>

<p>Oxford&#146;s MSc in Environmental Change and Management is now in its fifth year, and
receiving an average of 230 applications from throughout the world, for the 30 places on
the course. The intake is international - for the last two years we have achieved a
student mix covering fourteen or more countries, from all five continents, and with a wide
variety of disciplinary backgrounds, from Economics to Ecology, Law to Latin American
Studies.</p>

<p>The course was seen as an inspirational model by a NATO workshop on Teaching Global
Science for the way in which so many disciplines from around the University are involved.
In this respect the course reflects the Environmental Change Institute's (ECI) remit to
act as a catalyst for cross-departmental initiatives in environmental teaching and
research. The ECI is a relatively new - and growing - research Unit with some 30
researchers involved in interdisciplinary and collaborative research on the nature,
causes, and impacts of environmental change, and to the development of strategies for
dealing with future changes.</p>

<h2><font color="#000080">Why Oxford&#146;s MSc is distinctive</font></h2>

<p>A distinctive - and probably unique - feature of this course is its focus on how
present and future changes in the local and global environment may be managed. Other
environmental change graduate courses tend to concentrate on the past, on limited aspects
of the present such as conservation, landscape ecology, or are exclusively method-based
(eg Geographic Information Systems, Environmental Impact Assessment).</p>

<p>The ECI&#146;s MSc takes a broad view and balances a strong conceptual approach with
coverage of relevant methods. The complexity of modern environmental problems requires
students to cover a wide range of topics including current issues and their driving
forces, methods for environmental management, and the response of society to environmental
change, including law, ethics, economics, and policy.</p>

<h2><font color="#000080">Course Content</font></h2>

<p>The course is based upon three central elements: </p>

<p>&#149; Issues and Driving Forces, including issues of global and national concern, and
driving forces such as population, energy, and land use change; </p>

<p>&#149; Managing the Environment, concerned with the legal, economic and ethical
underpinning of environmental management and decision making, and a consideration of
policy and management strategies at a variety of scales from the global to the local; </p>

<p>&#149; Methods and Techniques for Environmental Management, including laboratory and
field-based work - computing, modelling and survey techniques, Geographic Information
Systems, environmental assessment, and remote sensing. </p>

<p>&nbsp;Students specialise in two option courses, for example in transport, energy, food
security, environmental law, biodiversity, environmental economics, and also undertake
individual research leading to a 15,000 word dissertation at the end of the course.
Students are able to seek supervisors from across the University, or indeed beyond, to
facilitate research into a wide range of topics, developing personal interests and
specialisms. </p>

<h2><font color="#000080">A Diverse Teaching Input</font></h2>

<p>A particular feature of the course is the teaching input from several departments
including Educational Studies, Geography, Management, Plant Sciences, Socio-Legal Studies,
Transport Studies, and Zoology. It is our aim that students should benefit from the
immense depth and breadth of expertise that Oxford has to offer in teaching on the
environment.</p>
