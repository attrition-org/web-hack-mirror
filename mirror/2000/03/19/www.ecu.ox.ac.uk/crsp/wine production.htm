    <font SIZE="2"><p>The work presented has been researched and developed by Dr Paula
    Harrison and Dr Ruth Butterfield of the Environmental Change Institute, University of
    Oxford. The work was funded by the European Commission&#146;s Environment programme as
    part of a large European consortium (16 Institutes from across Europe) which investigated
    the potential effects of climate change on agriculture in Europe. The project was called
    CLIVARA.</p>
    <p>The scenarios used for the model results are projections for <b>2050</b> provided by
    the UK Meteorological Office&#146;s HADCM2 model using a IS92a-type forcing scenario with
    a global mean temperature change of 2<sup>o </sup>C. This assumes that the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
    will have increased to 515ppmv (from a current level of 353ppmv).</p>
    <p>The summer mean temperature is projected to be 2<sup>0</sup>C higher than at present in
    the south-east of England decreasing to 1.6<sup>o</sup>C in Scotland (there is a gradient
    of warming from south-east to north-west). Winter temperature will again be 2 <sup>0</sup>C
    higher than present in the SE decreasing to 1.8 <sup>0</sup>C in Scotland based on this
    scenario (see Table 1). This is classified as a medium-high scenario, meaning it is a
    &#145;high&#146; greenhouse gas forcing scenario which is the equivalent of a 1% increase
    per annum in equivalent carbon dioxide concentration. Lower forcing scenarios produce
    lower temperature increases for 2050. </p>

<p>Currently wine production in this country is limited by first, summer temperatures,
which are sometimes too cool and the season is too short for good maturation, and secondly
the risk of spring frosts, which kill the growing buds. Climate change will mean an
increase in summer temperatures, causing the vines to develop more quickly so that
harvesting can happen earlier &#150; before the onset of cooler wetter weather &#150;
meaning less fungal disease (which is damaging to the quality of the wine) and better
harvesting conditions.</p>

<p>Climate change may therefore mean that the enterprise is less risky in the future.</p>

<p>Warmer summers will also allow the UK to grow a wider choice of varieties originating
from southern Germany and central France (for 2050). As it gets warmer the choice will
increase. </p>

<p>An increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has a fertilizing effect on the crop by
increasing the rate of photosynthesis (photosynthesis is more efficient at higher CO<sub>2
</sub>concentrations). This means more carbohydrates are fixed by the crop resulting in
larger grapes, possibly higher sugar comtent and higher overall yield per m<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>The quality of wine is largely determined by the composition of the fruit. Sugar and pH
level are the main parameters which determine the final alcohol content and its influence
on wine flavour, while the acid content is important in the balance or acidity of the
wine. At present only one study in the Chianti region, central Italy, on one variety has
been conducted so it is difficult to estimate possible impacts on yields. A possible
increase in sugar content (and therefore alcohol content) due to enrichment with CO<sub>2</sub>
might be expected to result in a heavier wine. </p>

<p>In all cases in the Italy experiments an increase in temperature and CO<sub>2</sub>
resulted in an increase in fruit dry matter (ie harvested yield). In general effects on
yield and quality are expected to increase.</p>

<p>In the UK wine is already grown as far north as south Wales, Cheshire, West Yorkshire,
and Humberside. According to our new grapevine model (calibrated to UK conditions) this
northern limit will shift to southern coastal Scotland by 2050 (see maps). Bud burst and
flowering will occur earlier by approximately 15 to 25 days (varying spatially). Maturity
will occur between one month and a month and a half earlier in most places (from a median
maturity date across the current region of mid October). Although the crop will develop
more quickly (giving it less time to intercept solar radiation) the beneficial effects of
elevated carbon dioxide result in 10 to 25% increases in yield. (The effects of changes in
precipitation have not been analysed).</p>
