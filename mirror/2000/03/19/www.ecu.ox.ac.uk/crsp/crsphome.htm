<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>

<p>Research in the ECI on Climate, Resources and Society (CRS) spans three <b>dimensions</b>:

<ul>
  <li>From present climatic variability to future climatic hazards and long-term climate
    change </li>
  <li>From sectoral studies -- of agriculture, water and ecosystems, for example -- to
    cross-sectoral and integrated assessments of land use and climate policy </li>
  <li>From bio-geophysical impact modelling to social, institutional and economic effects and
    adaptation</li>
</ul>

<p>Within this matrix, we focus on five substantive <b>themes</b>:</p>

<p><i>Theme one: </i>The impact of climate change on managed and semi-natural
resources--land, water and biodiversity -- addresses the &quot;what if&quot; question:
What will be the impacts if climate change? Our European project on climate change and
agriculture illustrates many innovative methodologies for climate change impact
assessment.</p>

<p><i>Theme two: </i>Adaptation to climatic hazards and climate change evaluates response
options, including social and institutional learning, over the next few years to decades:
How can we cope with present hazards and future climate change? For example, a dynamic
approach to projections of water demand provides a systematic means to test hypotheses
about sensitivity to trends and extremes in climate, the effect of underlying demographic
and consumer change, and the impact of demand management.</p>

<p><i>Theme three:</i> For the first time in our history, we can predict many of the
features of our weather and climate. This extraordinary skill underlies our aim to develop
techniques for seasonal climate forecasts, with lead times of months to perhaps a few
years, and apply them in the management of resources and economies and in disaster
preparedness. Seasonal climate forecasting provides new opportunities to manage resources
-- to anticipate climate change. </p>

<p><i>Theme four</i>: Integrated assessment is a growing field that seeks to bridge the
three dimensions noted above. Understaning the impacts of climatic variations, and the
efficacy of adaptive strategies, requires assessments that integrate: across sectors
(e.g., agriculture and semi-natural ecosystems influence water supply), between
geophysical and socio-economic factors, and among the many stakeholders responsible for
adaptive responses. Our work focuses on land cover and land use, economic valuation of
climate change damages and understanding climate policy.</p>

<p><i>Theme five</i>: Vulnerable communities -- hot spots of environmental, social,
economic and political change -- provide a connection between the driving forces of global
change and the contextual nuances of vulnerability and deprivation. In association with
the Refugee Studies Programme and Department of Geography, this theme addresses the
conjuncture of environment and livelihood security.</p>

<p><b>Methodologies</b> underpinning our research relate to integrated assessment. Key
concerns include (see specific projects for current development): 

<ul>
  <li>Spanning geographic and temporal scales </li>
  <li>Coupling remote sensing and Earth Observation techniques with dynamic simulation models </li>
  <li>Providing interfaces to common data sets to aid in their documentation, visualisation,
    and interpretation </li>
  <li>Integrating social and institutional analysis (dynamic social simulation) in assessments
    of climate policy</li>
</ul>

<p>Further details are provided in the project synopses.</p>

<p></font><font size="3">Presentations of our research work</b></p>

<p>Our research is reported in numerous published documents--journal papers, books,
brochures, etc. At the same time, we frequently report results at conferences and
workshops. We are now making an effort to provide public access to these presentations,
with some caveats regarding unpublished and confidential material. Recent presentations
can be found on the ECI web <a
