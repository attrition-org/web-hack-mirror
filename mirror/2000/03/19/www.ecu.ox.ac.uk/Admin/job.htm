    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> The Environmental Change Institute, Oxford
    University's principal centre for organising&nbsp; and promoting research and teaching on
    the environment is developing a new research theme on the Earth's carbon&nbsp; cycle.
    &nbsp; Using the synergy of both Synthetic Aperture Radar and Optical/Near&nbsp; Infra-red
    remote sensing, together with&nbsp; climate and physical data, this&nbsp; research, funded
    under a NERC/BNSC LINK programme, will advance existing&nbsp; methodologies for estimating
    carbon storage in forest ecosystems. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In&nbsp; particular, the primary aims of this
    proposal&nbsp; are:&nbsp; (1) To investigate the capability of Synthetic Aperture Radar
    (SAR)&nbsp; remote sensing to estimate and monitor&nbsp; temporal change in biomass
    density of managed conifer plantations and evaluate biomass density in a semi-natural
    mixed deciduous forest, and&nbsp; (2) To investigate the complimentary use of optical and
    near infrared remote sensing for constraining and characterising forest ecosystem models
    for estimating Net Primary Productivity and evaluate models of carbon partitioning.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    This research project, in collaboration with the University of Swansea, Institute of
    Terrestrial Ecology and industrial partners, is expected to start in November 1999.
    Applicants are sought for the following research positions: Post-Doctoral Research
    Scientist Supporting aim (1), you will be expected to have a proven track record in
    environmental remote sensing and preferably experience in the&nbsp; application of SAR
    data.&nbsp; Salary will be on scale RS1A from £16,286 to&nbsp; £24,479 per annum. The
    position is available for 2 years. D.Phil.&nbsp; studentship Supporting aim (2), you
    should have a post-graduate degree in an&nbsp; environmental sciences discipline and
    &nbsp; strong analytical skills. The student will be co-supervised by Dr Terry Dawson of
    the ECU and Dr. Ronny Milne,&nbsp; Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, Bush Estate, Penicuik
    and it is expected&nbsp; that the student will spend between 6-12&nbsp; months at the ITE
    station in Scotland. The studentship covers University and College fees plus an annual
    &nbsp; stipend of £6,700 per annum for 3 years.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Start date for both positions is as soon as
    possible. Further details for the&nbsp;&nbsp; post-doctoral research scientist available
    from&nbsp; enquiries@ecu.ox.ac.uk (Tel: 01865 281180)&nbsp; Applications, including
    &nbsp; CV and names of two referees, should be sent ASAP to the&nbsp; Administrator,

    <p></font><font face="Times New Roman">The Environmental Change Institute seeks to appoint
    a post-doctoral fellow in integrated water resource assessment for three years, beginning
    1 March 2000. The project will use interdisciplinary approaches to address the links
    between hydrology, socio-economic change, and resource management. The fellow will work on
    the EU-funded FIRMA project (currently under contract negotiation). The fellow is likely
    to have a PhD in a relevant discipline or equivalent experience, skills in modelling
    (especially agent-based social simulation), and knowledge of water resource issues in
    Europe and southern England. The ECI is coordinating an integrated assessment in the
    Thames region, with close collaboration with other research institutes and stakeholders in
    the region. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The salary scale is likely to be the post-doctoral scale
