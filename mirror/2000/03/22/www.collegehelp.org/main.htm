First off,&nbsp; Team Zer0-Gen is NOT dead.. You may or may not have known me as Opiat3,  but I'd just like to say,  after a hibernation period, everything's functional and ready to be taken to another level. 
I'm reborn,  and now go by the tag Nytek and I like to eat apples and bananas.  Thanks for the time.  On with what I came here to say:<br>

Ok,  what's going on with this whole brazilian hacker conflict type thing?  
Now don't get me wrong,  I've got nothing against Brazilians, or Brazilian hackers alike.. but come on.  
These groups today for instance one of them with two unnamed members redefaced a site I know of about two times (after two other people).  
I know I've said this before, and I'm glad other groups are starting to notice this and confront them.  We don't need to fight.. there will never be a "best", despite our egos.
It's time to get the ethics going, and it's time to form alliances, not digital war.  If we can't do that,  it's our own downfall brought on by our own peers. It's the destruction of a whole society
that exists in the underground, and is slowly becoming surfaced due to media overkill and intergroup wars.  If I'm rambling, I'm sorry.. I'll cut to the point.  UNITE! Fight to save the dying sub-culture of the internet world.
