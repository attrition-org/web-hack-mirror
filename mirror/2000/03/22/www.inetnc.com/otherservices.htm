INETNC strives to stay at the forefront of both Internet technology as well as Internet <i>community</i>.
We offer not only Internet Services, but also Internet content. Here are two such online
services which INETNC offers. </p>

<hr NOSHADE WIDTH="75%">

<p>Sure, the Internet is huge. You can find just about any thing you want on any subject.
A side effect of its enormous, International, boundary-less nature is that it can be very
impersonal. Get a sense of community on the 'net by interacting with <i>your</i> community
at Crossroads. Here you can discuss local issues, find people with like interests, and
generally bring a little bit of your own community to the Internet. Look around--you'll be
sure to make a new friend!</p>
