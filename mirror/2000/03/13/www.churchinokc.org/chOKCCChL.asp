    <td valign="top"><p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#000099" size="4"><b>Concerning
    the Church Life...</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>A CORPORATE LIFE:</b> By its very nature the
    Christian life, which is the living out of Christ as life from within us, is a corporate
    life. Many expressions in the New Testament confirm this: we are sheep in God's flock, we
    are living stones in God's building, we are branches in the vine, we are members of the
    Body of Christ. Although we remain individuals, as Christians we should no longer live
    individualistically, that is, caring only for our own interest, activities, and goals. On
    the contrary, God desires that we live a cooperate life, conscious of the Body of Christ,
    mindful of the things of others, and concerned for the building up of the church.
    Therefore, we are experiencing a recovery not only of the normal Christian life, but also
    of the normal church life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST:</b> In the church life we
    all need to honor the headship of Christ. We are the Body, and He is the unique Head of
    the Body. No one and nothing can presume to usurp Christ's headship. We cannot tolerate
    any system, organization, or leadership that insults the headship of Christ. Among us
    there is no permanent, official, organized leadership. Furthermore, there is no hierarchy.
    Rather, all the members of the Body are encouraged to have direct fellowship with the Head
    and receive from him all directions concerning their life and movements. We recognize no
    intermediaries between Christ and the members of His Body.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>FELLOWSHIP:</b> Even as we honor the headship of
    Christ, we also enjoy the fellowship of the Body of Christ. We recognize that, in Christ,
    we should no longer live in an individualistic way. On the contrary, we greatly value the
    fellowship among the members of the Body. How we enjoy the flow of life that circulates
    through the Body of Christ! We testify that this flow, this fellowship, is a blessed
    reality.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>ONENESS:</b> Another vital concern in the church
    life is the keeping of the oneness. Before He was crucified, the Lord prayed that those
    who believe in Him would be one even as He and the Father are one. Therefore, we must
    diligently maintain the unique oneness of the Body of Christ, which is expressed in local
    churches established on the ground of oneness, we receive all believers according to the
    common faith, and we seek to grow in Christ so that we may be with Him in the Father and
    in the Father's glory, where we are perfected into one. We believe that the Lord's prayer
    in John 17 will be answered on earth and that as we are perfected into one, the world will
    believe and know that the Father has sent the Son.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>MUTUAL CARE FOR ONE ANOTHER:</b> In the practice
    of the church life, we care for the saints, the believers in Christ, in a practical way.
    We delight to bear one another's burdens, to extend hospitality to visitors, to open our
    homes for fellowship, and to meet the practical needs of the brothers and sisters through
    loving service in the name of Christ. We encourage one another, refresh one another,
    minister Christ as life to one another, and build up one another. Our church life is not
    limited to meetings in our place of meeting; it goes on all the time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>THE CONSCIENCE:</b> In the church life we also
    honor the conscience of others. This means that all the believers in Christ have liberty
    to follow the Lord according to their conscience and in the light they have received from
    God through His Word. There is no external control molding and manipulating our daily
    lives, and there is no authoritarian disregard of our conscience. There is neither
    coercion nor compulsion. Rather, all are encouraged to deal thoroughly with their
    conscience in the sight of God and to maintain a conscience void of offense toward God and
    toward man. Thus, we care for conscience and for the conscience of others.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>MEETINGS:</b> Because the church life is a
    meeting life, we usually have meetings several times a week. To us, meetings are not
    drudgery; they are an enjoyment. In the church meetings we are supplied, instructed,
    strengthened, encouraged, enlightened, inspired, equipped, build up, and commissioned by
    the Lord. In the proper church life there is a balance between the personal Christian life
    and the corporate meeting life. The personal time with the Lord cannot replace the
    meetings, and the meetings cannot replace the personal time. We delight to meet with Him
    individually, and we enjoy even the more meeting with Him corporately. We testify that in
    the church meetings the resurrected Christ truly is with us as we are gathered into His
    name.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE MEMBERS:</b> In the
    church life every member of the Body can function. Although we do not all have the same
    function, we all have a function, and the function of every member is appreciated. We
    absolutely repudiate the clergy-laity system as a strategy of Satan to frustrate the
    function of the members of the Body of Christ. In the local churches we have no clergy and
    we have no laity; rather, we are members of the Body, all of whom have the right to
    function according to their measure. Furthermore, we have no pastor and no janitor. All
    the saints may share in the meetings, and all may also partake of the cleaning service.</font></p>
