    <br>
    Lovers of Christ in His ascension<br>
    enjoy the riches of His life.<br>
    She becomes His private garden<br>
    with its fountain, fruit and spice.<br>
    Christ is hers and she is <br>
    Christ's dear love.<br>
    <br>
    She is as beautiful as Tirzah <br>
    as lovely as Jerusalem.<br>
    Through her living in <br>
    Christ's ascension<br>
    her dear heart is now His home.<br>
    She's become the sanctuary of God.<br>
    <br>
    Who is this woman I am seeing?<br>
    Shining forth as the moon and sun.<br>
    She is absolutely heavenly, <br>
    from the old creation free;<br>
    overcoming all to live within the veil.<br>
    <br>
    An army terrible with banners<br>
    Christ's lovers overcome to be.<br>
    Those attracted by His beauty,<br>
    fully trusting in His power.<br>
    Her romance is now the<br>
    dances of two camps.<br>
    <br>
    The Shulamite, His duplication,<br>
    His counterpart has now become.<br>
    She's the same in life and nature,<br>
    His expression to the full;<br>
    consumated as the New Jerusalem.<br>

    One of the last things <br>
    that the Son said,<br>
    before He died and rose up <br>
    from the dead,<br>
    Was that He'd go prepare a <br>
    place for us, that where He is <br>
    we too could be.<br>
    <br>
    Chorus:<br>
    He said: &quot;In my Father, In Me, In you,<br>
    in that day you'll know<br>
    I'm in my Father, you're in Me <br>
    and I am in you.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He spoke of going and returning.<br>
    He'd send the Spirit <br>
    (whom we already knew).<br>
    He said He would not leave us orphans,<br>
    because He lives we would live too.<br>
    <br>
    Chorus:<br>
    God became a man<br>
    just like you and me.<br>
    Lived a human life <br>
    Oh, so perfectly.<br>
    Died an all-inclusive death <br>
    and then He rose up to become <br>
    the all-inclusive, compound,<br>
    life-giving, indwelling Spirit.<br>
    Then breathing into His disciples <br>
    He told them, &quot;Receive ye the Holy Breath&quot;.<br>
    This the fulfillment of what He had spoken,<br>
    &quot;In that day I will be in you.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Chorus:<br>
    So now today we're coinhering.<br>
    We dwell in Him and He is dwelling in us.<br>
    We're in the sweet incorporation<br>
    of God and man, how glorious!<br>

    No man or angel ever knew<br>
    this secret hidden deep in You.<br>
    That You desired to be one with man <br>
    before the world began.<br>
    Though sin came in to ruin me <br>
    through Satan's scheme and subtlety;<br>
    nothing could break Your love for me <br>
