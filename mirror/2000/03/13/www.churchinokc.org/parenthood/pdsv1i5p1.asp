    <center><font face="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>THE GRACE OF DISCIPLINE</b></font></center>
    <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">Parenthood is a divine responsibility&#151;God has put our children
    into our hands to care for them on His behalf. They do not belong to us. We must always
    remember that our children are entrusted to us by our Father to raise them up in His
    nurture and admonition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">Discipline is a key factor in the proper raising of
    children. Without adequate and appropriate discipline, children are not able to grow and
    learn both in their humanity and in the grace of the Lord. The parents of modern America
    generally appear unwilling to take proper steps in discipline&#151;perhaps because they
    fear losing the affection of their children. Parents should always persevere in
    controlling and directing the living and practices of their children even at the risk of
    losing their &quot;love&quot; on a temporary basis. By such perseverance, we train our
    children to honor their parents and ultimately to honor their God.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">The pattern for our parenting is our heavenly Father
    Himself. The manner in which He cares for His children is the manner in which we should
    care for our children. The way in which He disciplines His own people is the way in which
    parents should discipline their children. In the most recent issue of <i>Parenthood</i> we
    emphasized that we must have an attitude toward our children of nurturing. The Apostle
    Paul did not firstly charge parents to keep their children under authority with all
    diligence. Rather, he urged them (especially the fathers) to not provoke their children to
    anger. In this issue, however, we focus our attention on the necessity of the <i>proper</i>
    <i>use of discipline</i>. The messages we quote are simple: our Father disciplines us for
    our growth, development and ultimate usefulness; we in the same way must discipline our
    children.</font></p></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">Finally, we print a brief quote
    from the <i>PG&amp;E Progress</i> which asks a sobering question, &quot;Will History
    Repeat?&quot;</font><hr width="84%" size="1">
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>PARTAKERS OF THE DIVINE DISCIPLINE</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">We, the partakers of the heavenly calling, also partake of
    the divine discipline (12:8). I have been told that in Great Britain the crown prince, the
    successor to the throne, receives a great deal of discipline. A prince needs to be
    disciplined before he can assume the throne and have the kingship. This is the kind of
    discipline that we are now partaking of. As successors to the throne, we all are under the
    divine discipline. As holy brothers we need to partake of the divine holiness brought to
    us by the Holy Spirit within us. As partakers of the heavenly calling, we need to partake
    of the divine discipline accomplished by the Holy Spirit through our environment. We holy
    brothers are partakers not only of the heavenly calling but also of the Holy Spirit, of
    the divine holiness, and of the divine discipline for us to be perfected, equipped, and
    qualified that we may be the proper partners of God's anointed One.</font></p>

        and we respected <i>them</i>;<i> </i>shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father
        of spirits and live? For they disciplined for a few days as it seemed good to them; but
        He, for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness. Now no discipline at the
        present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward it yields the
        peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it.<br>

    <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">While in the parables we only have the principles, in Revelation
    2:26-27 we have the details. Here we are told, &quot;He that overcomes, and keeps my work
    unto the end, to him will I give authority over the nations: and he shall rule them with
    the rod of iron&quot; (Gk.). The nations on earth surely need to be ruled by us. When the
    Lord Jesus returns, He will assign us to rule over all the nations. In that day there will
    be no more nonsensical talk. Everyone will talk rightly because they will be under the
    proper ruling. Who will rule over them? We, the people who have been disciplined. Do you
    believe that all the rulers today are the proper persons? Some of them smoke, drink, and
    gamble. How could they be the proper rulers? The whole earth is waiting and groaning to be
    released from the improper rulers. The earth will be released from that kind of rule when
    the Lord Jesus comes back. Why has the Lord Jesus not yet returned? Because we have not
    yet been disciplined. If He were to come back today, whom would He assign to rule over the
    nations?</font></p>

    <p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" SIZE="3">THE FATHER'S DISCIPLINE</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">We come now to the fifth warning in chapter twelve of
    Hebrews. Verse 5 says, &quot;And you have completely forgotten the exhortation which
    reasons with you as with sons, My son, do not make light of the discipline of the Lord,
    nor faint when reproved by Him.&quot; The word discipline in this verse points to some
    kind of punishment. Verse 6 continues, &quot;For whom the Lord loves He disciplines and
    scourges every son whom He receives.&quot; To scourge here means to whip. Most of us
    received some kind of scourging from our parents when we were children. In like manner,
    our Father scourges His children.</font></p>
