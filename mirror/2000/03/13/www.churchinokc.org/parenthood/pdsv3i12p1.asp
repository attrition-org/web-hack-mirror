    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In August of 1996, Brother Witness Lee, during a time of
    intimate fellowship with some of his co-workers, expressed his burden that some of our
    university students in corporate living arrangements may not be receiving the kind of
    loving and forgiving care that we find in the heart of our Father God. He cited the
    parable of the prodigal son to show that our Father's love and forgiveness are clearly
    depicted by the father in the parable. The father anxiously watched for the return of his
    son, and when the prodigal returned, the father ran to meet him and kissed him with a
    joyful embrace. Although the prodigal was ready to live as a hired hand to his father, the
    father welcomed him home with a robe, a ring, and a feast. We, however, may be very
    different in our approach toward those who do not live up to our standard of proper
    behavior. Instead of love and forgiveness, we may exercise a strict code of discipline
    insisting that every violation must be answered by a just retribution.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">During the course of his fellowship relating to our
    oversight of students in corporate living arrangements, Brother Lee often referred to
    parental care. This issue of Parenthood excerpts the portions in which he cited parental
    care as an example of the care that we should afford to the students in corporate housing.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">First, we need to realize that our children's salvation
    relies ultimately, not on our persistence and faithfulness in raising our children, but on
    the Lord's choosing and predestination. He wrote, &quot;We should raise up our children
    according to the Lord's teaching. This is our duty and we should do it, but eventually
    their salvation and seeking of the Lord depend upon God's eternal choosing and
    predestination.&quot;</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Secondly, while we remain
    absolutely dependent on the sovereignty of God for our children's spiritual well-being, we
    still must exercise the utmost care, shepherding them with much cherishing and nurturing.
    &quot;To me, shepherding means everything&#133;,&quot; he asserts. He urges us, as
    parents, to exercise tender care for our children: &quot;Even in our human life, family
    life, and marriage life there is the need of shepherding, and shepherding requires
    cherishing.&quot;</font><br><br>

    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">According to history, the children of many nominal
    Christians become real Christians. I was one of these children. My mother was not saved;
    she was merely nominal, but when she was young, she stayed with her grandfather who was a
    good Southern Baptist, and he sent her to study at a Southern Baptist school. Because of
    this, she was one hundred percent for Christianity. In our home she taught us stories from
    the Gospels. She had printed tracts pasted on the wall. That was very unusual in our
    country. When we were growing up, she wanted us to go to her church. She washed our
    clothes for us on the Lord's Day, she prepared better meals on that day, and she brought
    us to her church. She was not saved, yet my second sister got saved, then I, and then my
    younger brother. Three of her children were not only saved but also became seeking
    Christians.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">I have seen many devoted
    Christians. Among them, one was Brother Nee. Not all of Brother Nee's brothers were
    properly saved. Brother Nee's mother was a sister who loved the Lord very much. It is no
    wonder that she would weep for her sons. I have seen many others like this. Even among us
    there are many good sisters who love the Lord very much and pray for their children nearly
    every day, even though their children do not believe. On the other hand, some parents are
    not so devoted, yet their children love the Lord. Eventually, I have bowed down before the
    Lord. The Lord's word is true. We should raise up our children according to the Lord's
    teaching. This is our duty and we should do it, but eventually their salvation and seeking
    of the Lord depend upon God's eternal choosing and predestination. If our raising of our
    children could decide their spiritual future, this would be against God's predestination.</font><p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Isaac brought forth two sons as twins. One was Esau and the other
    was Jacob. The Bible says clearly in Malachi 1:2-3, &quot;I loved Jacob; but Esau I
    hated.&quot; This creates a very big problem in theology. For this reason there is
    Calvinist theology and Armenian theology. The former says that our salvation is up to
    God's choosing, and the latter says that our salvation is our responsibility and according
    to our endeavoring. The Armenians say that we can be saved in the morning and lost in the
    evening. The Pentecostals are Armenians, while the Presbyterians are Calvinists. The
    Lutherans also teach that salvation is not up to us. Whether we go to the theater or
    whatever we do, as long as we have been chosen, our eternal security is fixed because it
    depends upon God's choosing. </font></p>
