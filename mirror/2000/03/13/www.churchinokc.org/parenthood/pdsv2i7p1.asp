    Our Children Concerning The Lusts of the Flesh</b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b><i>You are the salt of the earth. But if
    the salt has become tasteless, with what shall it be salted?</i></b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The world is decaying and the Christian community has lost
    its saltiness. Especially in the realm of the lusts of the flesh and sexual conduct, the
    Christian community is becoming corrupted with the immorality of the age. As parents we
    need to fellowship with one another concerning how we can guide our children into living
    as proper people before God, preserving their human vessels to serve the Lord. It is
    extremely important that we find a way to have an intimate part in the base and
    development of the sexual views and attitudes of our children. For this purpose, we must
    build a strong relationship and involvement with our children throughout their toddler
    years right through puberty and into young adulthood.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Parents are the most important factor in the growth of the
    view our children have concerning their sexuality. We must be involved. Peers are the
    primary way that most children learn about sexual activity. In today's educational system,
    they have heard about and are educated concerning sex, but what they have heard is
    misguided and often perverted information. The media, especially television invades them
    with distorted and evil concepts. They haven't heard of proper human living or the image
    of God;the spiritual dimension attached to their humanity. It is important that parents
    get involved with their children in the process (the gradual growth--not majoring on the biological
    aspects) of their development as proper human beings. The real issue at hand for the
    parents is character.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">We must not only warn concerning
    the dangers of fornication and sexual promiscuity, but shape their character with a strong
    and positive attitude toward their calling by God in sanctification. They should be helped
    to realize that marriage, including the intimacy of the marriage bed, is ordained by God
    and to be held in honor. This is the responsibility of the parents before God.<br><br></font>

    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The Epistle of First Thessalonians was written to new
    believers, to those who had been in the Lord less than a year. For this reason, in the
    first three chapters of this book, we cannot find anything to compare with what is
    revealed in Romans, Ephesians, or Galatians. Paul stayed with the Thessalonians for
    approximately a month. In that short period of time he did not have the opportunity to
    cover many deeper truths....</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">We have emphasized the fact that in 1 Thessalonians we have
    a word to beginners, to new believers. Those who are working with young people or with new
    believers can receive from this book both a direction and an outline to follow. If they
    follow this outline and direction, they will lay a good foundation in their work with new
    believers.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>A WORD OF WARNING</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In this message we come to chapter four of 1 Thessalonians.
    In chapter one we have the structure and origin of a holy life for the church life; in
    chapter two, the fostering of such a life; and in chapter three the establishing of the
    three items of the basic structure of this life. After covering these matters, in chapter
    four Paul injects an inoculation into the believers concerning the most serious germ that
    damages the church life, the germ of fornication.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Fornication has its source in
    lust. People would never have a chance to indulge themselves in this lust if they did not
    have some form of social life. Social life is a hotbed of fornication. A person who does
    not have a social life is not in danger of falling into fornication. If you live alone and
    have little contact with others, it is very unlikely that you will commit fornication. But
    the church life is a meeting life, a communal life. In other words, the church life is a
    social life. In order to have the church life, we cannot avoid having a communal life, a
    social life, in which we have considerable contact with one another.</font><p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">According to history, the problem of fornication has come up over
    and over again in one church after another. The facts prove that Christian workers in
    particular are often snared by fornication because they have so much contact with others.
    Furthermore, fornication has been the factor in damage caused to those in the Pentecostal
    movement. In certain places this movement has been limited because of the sin of
    fornication.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In 4:3 Paul says, &quot;For this is the will of God, your
    sanctification; that you abstain from fornication.&quot; God's will is that His redeemed
    people, the believers in Christ, should live a life of holiness according to His holy
    nature, a life wholly separated unto Him from anything other than Him. For this He is
    sanctifying us thoroughly (5:23).</font></p>
