    Our Children Concerning The Biblical View of Our Physical Bodies</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b><i>&quot;Do you not know that your bodies are members of
    Christ? Shall I then, taking the members of Christ, make them members of a prostitute?
    Certainly not!&quot; </i><br>
    1 Corinthians 6:15</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In the previous issue of parenthood we saw that as parents
    in the Lord's recovery, we must get involved in the development of the proper view in
    our children concerning their sexuality. Specifically, in that issue we reviewed the
    matter of dealing with the lusts of the flesh. We need to help our young people to develop
    as proper human beings by teaching them to know what is the living of a normal human life
    before God. We should train them to flee youthful lusts in order to preserve their human
    vessels for serving the Lord.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In this issue, we will continue to consider the vitally
    important factor in the education of our children&#151;the preserving of our human vessels
    to serve the Lord. We must provide our children with the proper view of their human bodies
    as vessels for the Lord. May we lead them to resolve to present their bodies as a living
    sacrifice, a sacrifice which is holy and well pleasing to God, that they would not be
    fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that they
    may prove what the will of God is (Rom. 12:1-2).</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Our children need to be given
    something to be &quot;for&quot; and not only something to be &quot;against&quot;. The
    Bible presents the view that our human body is created for God's economic purpose for
    man: to gain a universal incorporation of the union and mingling of divinity with
    humanity.</font><p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Commenting on the apostle Paul's
    declaration in First Corinthians quoted above, Bro. Lee states, &quot;Paul says clearly
    that our bodies are members of Christ. This is not an illustration, a metaphor, or a
    parable. On the contrary, it is a statement of fact. Our bodies are actually members of
    Christ. How marvelous!&quot; If our children are trained to realize that our bodies are
    the very members of Christ, they will have an appreciation and reverence for their bodies.
    This training will give them the motivation and strength to live a holy life for the
    church life.</font></p>

    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In 1 Corinthians Paul deals with matters in a particular
    sequence.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">First he deals with soulish desires and aspirations;
    second, with the fleshly lusts; and third, with the claiming of rights. As we have pointed
    out, this sequence is very meaningful. In this message we come to Paul's dealing with the
    abuse of freedom in foods and in the body, the fourth matter covered in this Epistle.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Foods for man to exist and
    marriage for man to propagate himself are both necessary and ordained by God. Man has the
    right to use them. However, he should not abuse them, nor should he be under their power,
    controlled and enslaved by them. Abusive eating, like the eating of sacrifices to idols,
    causes the weak brothers to stumble (8:9-13; 10:28-30, 32), and excessive eating damages
    our body. Both foods and our belly will be done away with; God will bring both to nothing
    (6:13). The abuse of sex is fornication. It is not only condemned by God; it also destroys
    our body (v. 18), which is for the Lord.</font><p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Both eating
    and marriage have been ordained by God and are necessary for the existence of mankind. If
    mankind is to continue on earth for the fulfillment of God's purpose, there is the need
    for eating and for marriage. Food is not only created by God, but also ordained by Him for
    our existence. Marriage is for the propagation of mankind. Because eating and marriage are
    both ordained by God, both are legal. In each case we have freedom, the freedom to eat and
    the freedom to marry. However, fallen man has abused his freedom in these matters. For
    this reason, after dealing with soulish aspirations, fleshly lusts, and the claiming of
    rights, Paul turns to the matter of the abuse of freedom&#133;.</font></p>
