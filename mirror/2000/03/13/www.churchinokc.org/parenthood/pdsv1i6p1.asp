<center><font FACE="Arial" size="4"><b>THE VIRTUE OF FORBEARANCE</b></font></center>
<p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In this issue of <i>Parenthood</i>, we explore our need for the
    all-inclusive virtue of forbearance. Without this virtue, our family life will lack the
    peaceful atmosphere needed for growth in &quot;wisdom and stature and in favor with God
    and men&quot; (Luke 2:42). Witness Lee defines forbearance:<br>
    In his Word Studies Wuest points out that the Greek word rendered forbearance not only
    means satisfied with less than our due, but also means sweet reasonableness. The word
    includes self-control, patience, moderation, kindness, and gentleness. Furthermore,
    according to Christian experience, forbearance is all-inclusive, for it includes all
    Christian virtues. This means that if we fail to exercise forbearance, we fail to exercise
    any Christian virtue. If a brother's wife serves him a cold drink contrary to his
    preference and he complains about it, then at that time he does not exhibit any Christian
    virtue. But if by the grace of Christ he is satisfied with less than his due and exercises
    forbearance toward his wife, not criticizing her or condemning her, he will show in his
    forbearance an all-inclusive Christian virtue. His forbearance will include patience,
    humility, self-control, looking to the Lord, and even the virtue of admitting that the
    Lord is sovereign in all things.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The reason we sometimes behave in an unseemly manner is
    that we lack forbearance. Negative attitudes and unkind words also come from a shortage of
    forbearance. When we fail to love, it is because we have no forbearance. Likewise, we may
    be intolerant because we lack forbearance. Even talkativeness may result from having no
    forbearance. If we do not have forbearance, we shall not have peace. If we do not show
    forbearance toward the members of our family, there will be no peace in our family life.
    Peace comes out of forbearance.<br>
    (<i>Life-Study of Philippians</i>, Message 56, p. 494).</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">We need a family life full of
    forbearance. Parents should learn to exercise forbearance in their care and discipline of
    their children to know why, when, and how to discipline them.</font> 
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>THE
    NEED OF FORBEARANCE IN OUR FAMILY LIFE</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">There is a great need of forbearance in our family life. A
    good family life is the product of forbearance. If a husband and wife show forbearance
    toward each other and toward their children, they will have an excellent married life and
    family life. However, if they do not exercise forbearance, they will seriously damage
    their life together as a family.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In dealing with their children, parents should be neither
    too strict nor too tolerant. Both excessive strictness and excessive tolerance are
    damaging to children. Then what is the right way for parents to care for their children?
    The right way is the way which is full of forbearance.</font></p>

        <td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;if they do not exercise forbearance, they will
        seriously damage their life together as a family.&quot;</b></font></td>

    </table>
    </center></div><p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Suppose a child does something wrong, and
    the matter is made known to his father. He should not rebuke his child in a hasty way or
    spank him in anger. In Ephesians 6 Paul tells us not to provoke our children. Usually
    parents provoke their children by dealing with them in anger. If you are angry with your
    child, you first need to ask the Lord to take away your anger. Once your anger has been
    dealt with by the Lord, you need to exercise your understanding to realize why the child
    made that particular mistake. No doubt, the child was wrong. Nevertheless, you still must
    understand his situation. Perhaps he was wrong because you were careless. If you had not
    been careless in that particular way, the child would not have made that mistake. </font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Because your carelessness
    afforded him the opportunity to do something wrong, you should not put the full blame on
    him. Rather, first you must blame yourself and then discipline the child. All this is
    included in exercising forbearance toward our children.</font><p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Parents need to exercise wisdom in speaking to their children. A child may need
    correction, but the parents need to sense when is the right time to speak to him. A father
    should ask himself whether or not he should rebuke his child in front of other children or
    even in front of the mother. Sometimes it is not wise to discipline a child in the
    presence of others. How much wisdom we must exercise in caring for our children! If we do
    not have forbearance, we shall not exercise wisdom. On the other hand, if we do not have
    adequate wisdom, we shall not be able to exercise forbearance.</font></p>
    <div align="center"><center><table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
      <tr>
        <td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.
        Let your forbearance be known to all men. The Lord is near. In nothing be anxious, but in
        everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to
        God; And the peace of God, which surpasses every man's understanding, will guard your
        hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.<br>
        <i>Philippians 4:4-7</i></b></font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center></div>
<p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">If we would show forbearance, we also need
    patience. Most parents find it difficult to be patient when they are disciplining their
    children. Suppose a brother is about to rebuke one of his children. It would be much
    better if he waited a few hours before saying anything. However, it is extremely difficult
    to wait even a few minutes, much less a few hours. The natural tendency is to deal with
    the children in haste. Such impatience is damaging.</font></p>
