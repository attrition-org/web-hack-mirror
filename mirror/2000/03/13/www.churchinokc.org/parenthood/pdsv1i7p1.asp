<center><font FACE="Arial" size="4"><b>THE EXERCISE OF FORBEARANCE</b></font></center>
<p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In the foregoing message we emphasized the need of forbearance in
    our married life, family life, and church life. For the building up of the church, the
    elders and all the saints need to exercise forbearance. Likewise, for a pleasant married
    life and an excellent family life we need to be forbearing. I hope that all the saints
    with children will be deeply impressed with the need to exercise forbearance in their
    daily living at home&#151;Witness Lee in the introduction to message fifty-nine of the <i>Life-Study
    of Philippians</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The need of forbearance in our daily living is the key
    thought emphasized in this issue of <i>Parenthood</i>. We have been given a major
    responsibility by the Lord&#151;the raising of our children in the nurture and admonition
    of the Lord. How can we carry out this responsibility? We must exercise the virtue of
    forbearance. We saw in the previous issue that forbearance includes self-control,
    patience, moderation, kindness, gentleness, and even all Christian virtues.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">This issue deals with the source or the means to attain to
    the virtue of forbearance. We see that forbearance is the result of rejoicing in the Lord.
    To exercise forbearance we need to be happy, be joyful in the Lord. Furthermore, we are
    shown that the lack of understanding others causes a lack of forbearance. And we need to
    exercise wisdom in speaking and dealing with others. In our practice of forbearance, we
    must learn when to speak, how to speak and how much to say to care for others.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">God, Himself, is the ultimate source of forbearance. He has
    given us a task, and He gives us the supply to accomplish that responsibility. He gives us
    forbearance and the forbearance He gives to us is Himself as the indwelling Spirit. As we
    receive this divine supply, we are able to fulfill the divine purpose. We will be able to
    build up a proper married life and family life, and a prevailing church life.</font></td>

    prevailing church life.</font> 
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>THE MEANING OF FORBEARANCE</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The Greek word rendered forbearance in (Philippians) 4:5 is
    composed of two words: <i>epi</i>, a preposition which means unto, and <i>eikos</i>, which
    means seemly, fitting, or suitable. When the preposition epi is added to other Greek words
    as a prefix, it often bears the meaning of full or extensive....The use of this
    preposition as a component of the Greek word for forbearance in 4:5 indicates that the
    meaning of this word is to be fully reasonable, or fitting or suitable to the fullest
    extent. We need to have a full and extensive reasonableness and considerateness.
    Furthermore, we need to act in a way that is fitting and suitable to the fullest
    extent....</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>REJOICING IN THE LORD</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">We have seen that forbearance requires maturity and also
    satisfaction and contentment. Now we need to see that forbearance is also related to
    rejoicing in the Lord. In 4:4 Paul says, &quot;Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will
    say, rejoice.&quot; Immediately after this he says, &quot;Let your forbearance be known to
    all men.&quot; If we do not rejoice in the Lord, we shall not be able to forbear. If we
    would make known our forbearance, we need to be happy and joyful in the Lord. Those who
    are sad or sorrowful cannot have forbearance. Instead, they find it easy to be upset, to
    complain, or to lose their temper. Forbearance in 4:5 is the issue, the result, of
    rejoicing in the Lord, mentioned in verse 4. From experience we know that rejoicing and
    forbearing go together.</font></td>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>THE NEED FOR UNDERSTANDING AND WISDOM</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Often we are not forbearing because of misunderstanding. In
    the church life often we may not understand the brothers and sisters. In our family life
    we may fail to understand our husband or wife. This lack of understanding causes a lack of
    forbearance. Suppose Paul had misunderstood the Philippians.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">He certainly would not have written them such a marvelous
    epistle....Paul, however, had a full understanding of God's economy and His move; he also
    understood the subtlety of Satan's attack. Moreover, he understood the saints in Philippi
    and their situation. To him everything was crystal clear. Thus, on his part there was no
    misunderstanding. He could exercise much forbearance in writing to the believers in
    Philippi....</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Paul needed to exercise wisdom in writing to the
    Philippians, and there is the need for us also to exercise wisdom in our married life.
    Husbands need wisdom in speaking with their wives, and wives need wisdom in sharing
    matters with their husbands. Here I would emphasize the need for the wife to have wisdom
    toward her husband. Suppose a sister intends to talk about a particular matter with her
    husband. Before she says anything, she needs to exercise understanding, consideration, and
    wisdom. If she speaks to him at the wrong time or if she says too much to him concerning
    the subject at hand, she may cause him to become angry not only with her, but also with
    others in the church life, even with the elders. Sometimes a husband becomes upset with
    the elders simply because his wife gives him information without exercising understanding,
    consideration, and wisdom. Even in passing on information to her husband, a sister needs a
    great deal of forbearance. </font></p>
