    THE GRACE OF LIFE</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With this issue of Parenthood, we begin a series of
    articles dealing with the issue of marriage in relation to child rearing. The relationship
    between the father and mother is the single most influential factor in the growth of
    children. In his first epistle, Peter speaks of the relationship between the husband and
    wife in terms of the wife's submission to her husband and of the husband's
    honoring of his wife. When either of these God-ordained functions in the marriage life is
    missing, the children suffer. The wife may feel control rather than honor; the husband may
    feel resistance instead of submission. In such a situation, the children do not have a
    proper covering for them to grow up in a healthy and proper atmosphere. In this issue we
    are addressing the matter of the wife's role and function. With the following issues
    we will deal with the husband's function and care of his wife.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The subject of submission is one which does not fit well
    with the prevailing attitudes in the world today. Hence, to the wives and mothers, it is
    troublesome. Every Christian wife and mother needs a vision of God's ordination in
    marriage in order that the function of submission and the adorning of a meek and quiet
    spirit may become a living source of enjoyment and fulfillment rather than a doctrinal
    source of frustration and suffering.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font face="Arial" size="2">To enter into her God-ordained
    function and blessing as a normal Christian wife and mother, a sister needs to lay down
    her soul life. The blessing and reality of such a living in submission is called the grace
    of life. The husband and wife are heirs together of this grace of life. Brother Witness
    Lee says, &quot;In brief, the grace of life is the Triune God processed to become the
    all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling Spirit. The Triune God is now within us as the
    grace of life. Both husbands and wives are joint-heirs of this grace of life. We inherit
    the grace of life together.&quot; When this glorious, divine fact becomes reality in the
    view and living of a couple, the result will be a marvelous increase in their experience
    of the Triune God's indwelling presence. This blessing becomes reality to the
    Christian wife through exercising to put on the adorning of a meek and quiet spirit.</font><br><br>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First Peter 3:1-13 is still in the section concerned with a
    life in an excellent manner toward all men in all concerns (2:11-3:13)&#133;. In 3:1-7
    Peter is concerned with marriage life, and in 3:8-13, with common life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Ephesians 5 Paul gives a word concerning married life
    that is familiar to every reader of the New Testament. But Peter's writing concerning
    married life in 3:1-7 also has some very good points, even the topmost point. The most
    outstanding point is what Peter says about a husband and wife being &quot;joint-heirs of
    the grace of life.&quot;</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font face="Arial" size="2">Paul does not say anything about
    the grace of life, much less about a married couple being joint-heirs, or co-heirs, of the
    grace of life. In 3:7 Peter says, &quot;The husbands, in like manner, dwelling together
    with them according to knowledge, assigning honor as to the weaker, female vessel, as also
    joint-heirs of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.&quot; Peter
    wanted the husbands and wives to realize that they are heirs together, not of property or
    material possessions, but of the grace of life.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Perhaps
    you have been a Christian for many years and yet do not have any understanding of what
    Peter means by the grace of life. Some may not even know that there is such an expression
    in the New Testament. Christians are familiar with the grace of salvation or the grace of
    forgiveness. Actually, it is not even necessary for us to read the Bible in order to have
    the concept of the grace of forgiveness. But the term, the grace of life, is a uniquely
    biblical expression. The problem is that, when we read about this, our mind may be veiled,
    or we may not pay adequate attention to this term. By the Lord's mercy, we would place a
    proper emphasis on this matter so that we may all appreciate it. I hope that we all shall
    see the wonderful matter of the grace of life. The grace of life is something real and
    substantial that we can inherit. This is not merely unmerited favor; it is solid,
    substantial, spiritual property that can be inherited by a husband and wife. Hallelujah
    for the grace of life!&#133;</font></p>
