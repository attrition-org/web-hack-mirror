<center><font FACE="Arial" size="4"><b>A MATTER OF SOWING</b></font></center>
<p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The exercise of parenting is an exercise of sowing. In everything
    that we do, we are sowing to the Spirit or sowing to the flesh. Whatever we do, positively
    or negatively will have an issue, a harvest. In Galatians 6:7-10, the Apostle Paul touched
    the matter of sowing in our daily living. Witness Lee, in addressing this portion of the
    Word in his Life-Study of Galatians, message 29, points out that we need to be careful not
    to sow to the flesh in all of the details of our living:</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><i>We should not continue to walk according to the flesh.
    We should not be in the flesh in expressing our attitudes. In speaking to their children,
    parents need to be in the Spirit and according to the Spirit. Otherwise, what they say
    will be a sowing unto the flesh. We should also be careful of the way we express our
    attitude. Even the expression of an attitude may be sowing according to the flesh. On the
    other hand, we may express our attitude by sowing unto the Spirit. We should also be
    cautious in expressing opinions. Do you have the assurance that the utterance of your
    opinion is according to the Spirit? If not, be careful, lest you sow unto the flesh. If we
    all sow unto the Spirit day by day, many problems will be eliminated. The troubles in the
    church life and in the family life will diminish. Most problems and troubles come from
    sowing unto the flesh.</i></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Many times when we deal with our children, we are drawn out
    of our spirit into our flesh by the frustration of the moment. In that situation we sow to
    the flesh rather than sowing to the Spirit. Is it any wonder that we later reap a harvest
    of the flesh?</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">We must apply the principles of
    right and wrong to the behavior of our young children, but we must avoid being in the
    source of right and wrong. Our source must always be the Spirit in our spirit. Unless we
    ourselves learn to live and walk according to our spirit we can never lead our children to
    eventually know and live in their spirit. </font><p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In
    Galatians 6:7-10 Paul covers the matter of how to sow. In verse 7 he warns, &quot;Do not
    be led astray, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he shall also reap.&quot;
    The admonition not to be led astray was spoken in reference to the false teachings of the
    Judaizers. These teachings led the Galatians astray from the Spirit in their spirit to the
    law by their flesh.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The matter of sowing is quite mysterious. What is it that
    we sow, and for what purpose do we sow? Some may understand Paul's word about sowing to
    refer to what he has previously spoken about bearing the burdens of others and about
    sharing the necessities of life with those who have need.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">According to this understanding, if one contributes to the
    daily need of a person serving the Lord in the Word, he is then sowing to the Spirit. I
    would agree that this is a proper application of Paul's word about sowing. However, our
    understanding of sowing should not be limited to this matter. As we shall seek to point
    out, sowing covers the totality of our Christian life.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Verse 8 says, &quot;Because he who sows unto his own flesh,
    shall reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit
    reap eternal life.&quot; </font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">To sow unto the flesh is to sow
    with a view to the flesh, or for the flesh, with the purpose of the flesh in view,
    fulfilling what the flesh covets. To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with
    the aim of the Spirit, accomplishing what the Spirit desires. To sow for the fulfilling of
    the purpose of the flesh issues in corruption; to sow for the accomplishing of the aim of
    the Spirit issues in life, even eternal life. Corruption is of the flesh, indicating that
    the flesh is corrupted; eternal life is of the Spirit and is the Spirit Himself.</font>
<p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Everything we do is some kind of sowing, either to the flesh or to
    the Spirit. Wherever we may be and whatever we are doing, we are sowing seeds. You sow at
    work and also at school. The elders sow while they are caring for the church, and those
    who minister the Word sow as they minister. Husbands and wives are constantly sowing in
    their married life, and parents are sowing in their family life. Everything parents say to
    their children and do with them is a seed sown into them. Day by day we all are sowing.
    The Christian life is a life of sowing. Furthermore, the place where we live and work is
    our farm. You are sowing even by the way you dress or style your hair. Virtually
    everything you do is an act of sowing. It is crucial for us to realize that the Christian
    walk must be a walk by the Spirit and a life of sowing to the Spirit.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Paul showed marvelous wisdom in his writing of 6:1-10,
    covering a number of crucial points. As we have seen, he speaks of things such as
    restoring a fallen one in a spirit of meekness and of fulfilling the law of Christ by
    giving something to meet the need of another. Then he tells us not to be led astray, since
    God is not mocked. </font></p>
