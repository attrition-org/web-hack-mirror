    Work of Fostering</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Our primary focus in the care of our children should be to
    cherish, nourish, and foster them for their growth in the life&#151;physical,
    psychological, and spiritual. The apostle Paul considered himself as both a nursing mother
    and an exhorting father to the spiritual family he had raised up in Thessalonica. Witness
    Lee in his Life-Study of First Thessalonians points out the various characteristics of
    Paul's care for his spiritual &quot;children,&quot; identifying this as a work of
    fostering. To foster signifies to provide the top atmosphere for proper growth in life.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Fostering care is a kind of watering, nourishing and
    cherishing of tender young plants so they may grow in a healthy and lasting way. In such a
    nurturing atmosphere the emphasis is not on teaching but on establishing a pattern to
    imitate. Paul presented himself as such a pattern to the believers under his care.
    Children learn and grow by imitating the life and living of their parents. Hence, we
    parents must present a proper pattern.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">To set up a proper pattern of life and practice, we must
    learn to use the Word of God to infuse into our children a realization that God has spoken
    to us through the scriptures. The Word of God&#151;not our philosophy, or merely our
    practice as a group of people who meet as the church in our locality&#151;is the base of
    all our living and practice. We must receive the Word of God and allow it to operate in us
    to constitute us with God's life, nature, and expression. The Bible must be prominent in
    our living and practice, and in the training of our children.</font></p></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Furthermore, we can foster our
    children by sharing with them stories about other saints and churches that they may aspire
    to serve the Lord all their lives. Even stories of suffering for the Lord's testimony
    equip them to boldly live the Christian life.</font><p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">We also
    must inoculate them early in their lives against all harmful things by repeatedly warning
    them of the things that will damage them for the Lord and His purpose.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Finally, it is imperative that we provide an emotional
    linkage with our children, loving them and viewing them as our hope, joy, and crown. This
    is to touch their hearts with tender fostering care, encouraging them to follow you
    closely to love the Lord.</font></p>

    </table>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">What we have in chapter two of 1 Thessalonians is the
    fostering of the young Christian life. In this chapter Paul is nourishing and cherishing
    the believers. According to his writing, he behaves himself as a nursing mother and an
    exhorting father. On the one hand, he is a mother cherishing; on the other hand, he is a
    father exhorting. His main concern is not teaching, but the carrying out of a fostering
    work to help the young saints to grow&#133;.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">According to what he says in chapter two, Paul regards the
    believers as members of a large family. Of course in a family there is the need for some
    amount of teaching. Both a mother and a father teach their children. However, in a family
    the focus is not on teaching the children, but is on raising them by cherishing,
    nourishing, and fostering them so that they may grow. Their growth is not mainly in
    knowledge; it is primarily a growth in life. As children grow in life, they spontaneously
    receive more education. The knowledge they acquire always goes along with their growth in
    life. They should not be given knowledge prematurely. This means that their knowledge
    should not exceed their growth of life&#133;.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">&#133;The church is a family. The
    church may also be compared to a farm or a garden. A family is a place where children grow
    up, and an orchard is a place where trees grow and produce fruit. Paul's concern in
    chapter two is with the growth of his children. He is fostering the young believers so
    that they may grow. We may also say that he is watering, nourishing and cherishing the
    tender young plants so that they may grow in life. This is the reason that instead of
    giving the believers a great deal of teaching, he presents them a pattern of life. This
    pattern of a proper living is actually Paul himself.</font>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>GROWING BY IMITATING</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Some Christian teachers say that a believer should not give
    a testimony concerning himself. According to these teachers, to testify of our experience
    is to preach ourselves. Therefore, they advise others not to speak of how they have
    repented, believed in the Lord, received grace, and have been saved. These teachers insist
    strongly that we should preach only the Lord Jesus and teach the Bible, but should never
    say anything about ourselves. In 1 Thessalonians 2, however, Paul certainly speaks about
    himself. He gives a strong testimony of his living among the Thessalonians. He reminds
    them of the apostles coming and of their manner of life among them. Why did Paul emphasize
    this? He emphasized it because he was presenting a pattern of a proper living to the young
    saints&#133;.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In 1:6 Paul says to the Thessalonians &quot;You became
    imitators of us and of the Lord.&quot; Imitating is related to growing. In fact, in many
    ways to imitate is to grow. In a family children imitate their parents and older brothers
    and sisters. The little ones do not invent anything; instead, they imitate others. </font></p>
