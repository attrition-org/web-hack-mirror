    CHILDREN AND FATHERS</font></b></center>
<p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The relationship between the
    children of the believers and their fathers is succinctly defined by the Apostle Paul in
    Ephesians chapter six. The children are to obey and honor their parents. Our children need
    to be trained to have an attitude of particular respect toward their parents. The
    commandment for children to honor their parents is ranked with the four commandments
    concerning God as given to Moses (Ex. 20:2-12). This indicates that when we honor our
    parents, we are remembering our source, God Himself. We who live in the United States are
    living in a society that in many respects has torn down the respect for all authority
    figures: the president of the country and all other political persons are despised by the
    majority of those who elect them, husbands are scorned by their wives, and parents are
    regularly disregarded or at best tolerated by their children. As believers, we need to
    train our children to honor their parents.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">On the other hand lies the issue of how we parents treat
    our children. It is significant that the Apostle Paul does not firstly charge parents to
    keep their children under authority with all diligence. Rather, he urges especially the
    fathers, &quot;do not provoke your children to anger but nurture them...&quot; (Eph. 6:4).
    This indicates that a major factor in the care and discipline of our children is our
    attitude toward them. The key meanings of nurture are firstly, to nourish and feed;
    secondly, to educate and train; and thirdly, to help grow and develop. Our children are
    very precious; their character, health, growth, and development have been committed by God
    into the hands of us parents. This is a sacred trust requiring our utmost attention and
    diligence.</font></td>

    we consider the relationship between children and fathers (parents).</font><p><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>I. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHILDREN AND FATHERS</b></font></p>

    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Ephesians chapter six, verse 1 says, &quot;The children,
    obey your parents in the Lord, for<i> </i>this is right.&quot; In exhorting the children
    and the parents, the apostle deals with the children first, since trouble comes mostly
    from them. In this verse Paul does not simply speak of children, but of <i>the </i>children.
    By using the definite article before children Paul indicates that the children of
    believers are not common. They are different from the children of people in the world.
    Therefore, the particular children, those in the families of believers, are exhorted to
    obey their parents in the Lord.</font></p>

    </center></div><p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The phrase &quot;in the Lord&quot; indicates
    obedience to the parents by being one with the Lord. It also indicates that this should be
    done not by self-effort, but <i>by </i>the Lord, and not according to the natural concept,
    but according to the Lord's word. The children of believers should realize that they are
    to obey their parents by being one with the Lord. Moreover, they are to obey their parents
    not by their own strength, but by the Lord Himself. Their obedience is to be according to
    the Lord's word, according to the Scriptures.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In this verse Paul says that for the children to obey their
    parents in the Lord is right. The Greek word may also be rendered just. To obey the
    parents is both right and just.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In verses 2 and 3 Paul goes on to
    say, &quot;Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise,
    that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth.&quot; This is not
    only the first commandment with a promise, but also the first commandment concerning man's
    relationship with man (Ex. 20:12). The promise, mentioned in verse 3, is that it may be
    well with the children and that they may live long on the earth. The first part of the
    promise is related to prosperity in material blessing; it also refers to living in a
    peaceful situation. The second part is to have longevity. According to this commandment,
    prosperity and longevity are God's blessings in this life to those who honor their
    parents. Honoring is different from obeying. Obedience refers to an action, whereas honor
    denotes an attitude. It is possible for the children to obey their parents without
    honoring them. In order to honor their parents, the children need a certain attitude, a
    certain spirit. All the children need to learn to obey their parents with honor.<br>

        And fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and
        admonition of the Lord.</b><br>

    to honor our parents. Those who fail to honor their parents commit suicide in a gradual
    way. They actually shorten their life on earth. If you wish to prolong your days, learn to
    obey your parents with honor. In the Bible this is the unique condition for having a long
    life. Anyone who desires a long life needs to fulfill this condition.</font></p>
