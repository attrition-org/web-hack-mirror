    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In this issue of Parenthood, we
    pick up two outlines from a very significant training that was recently given in a number
    of churches in the United States by a group of brothers from Taiwan. We participated in
    this training in the Santa Cruz Mountains January 31 through February 2, 1997. The
    training emphasizes that we are entering into a new era in the Lord's Recovery. The
    way for us to participate in this new era is to adopt a new culture by picking up a new
    language&#151;the language of the New Testament ministry. The new culture is entered into
    by closely following the teaching and fellowship of the apostles (Acts 2:42). The first
    outline presents the essential place of the apostles' speaking and leading in the
    accomplishing of God's economy. The second outline opens the view of the family life
    and the spiritual life blended together to reach God's goal among His chosen people.</font>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The teaching of the apostles is not the singular ministry
    of a particular person nor a special line of teaching. It is the entire speaking of God in
    the New Testament concerning His New Testament economy. This speaking of God in the New
    Testament began with Christ in His incarnation, continued in His speaking as the Spirit in
    the ministry through all of His New Testament apostles, and intensified in the speaking in
    the book of Revelation as the seven spirits of God. When we closely follow this ministry
    we will gain a good deposit for the completion of God's purpose in the building up of
    His universal body, His church.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">One of the key practices in the
    carrying out of the purpose of God in His Body, is the building up of a spiritual family
    life. This indicates the need to &quot;bring home&quot; our spiritual life, to let the
    church life become our community life and daily life and blend our church life and our
    family life together.</font><p><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><i>The understanding and
    appreciation of these outlines will be greatly enhanced by studying the accompanying
    verses cited.</i></font></p>

    Testament economy, and God's New Testament economy is to gain a universal incorporation of
