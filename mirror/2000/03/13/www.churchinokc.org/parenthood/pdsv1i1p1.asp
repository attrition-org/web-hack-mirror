<p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">Watchman Nee pointed out that the responsibility of parents is
    great. "God has delivered our children's bodies, souls, thoughts, lives, and
    futures into our hands. No person can influence another's destiny more than parents
    can their children's." </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" SIZE="3"><b>Great Responsibility</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">The Old Testament does not seem to have much teaching on
    parenthood other than in Proverbs, but in the New Testament Paul gives definite
    instruction on how to be parents. Parenthood is stressed in the New Testament. Though the
    New Testament does have some teaching on how to be children, it does not seem to be as
    strong as is the teaching on parenthood. The words for parents in both Ephesians 6 and
    Colossians 3 are stronger than those for children. God pays more attention to the parents
    than to the children. Man needs to learn how to be a parent.</font></p></td>

      <tr>
        <td align="center"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is
        right. Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise, That
        it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth. And fathers, do not
        provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the
        Lord...<br>Eph. 6:1-4</b></font></td>

<p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">A summary of all the words in the Bible on
    parenthood would come to this: nurture the children in the chastening and admonition of
    the Lord and do not provoke their wrath lest they be discouraged. In order to do this,
    parents must learn to control themselves; they themselves must know the discipline and
    teaching of the Lord. This is what Paul shows us. </font></p></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top">
<center><font face="Arial" SIZE="3"><b>Topic</b></font></center>
<p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">New believers, especially parents and future parents, should know
    that even as it is not easy to be a husband or a wife, it is even harder to be a father or
    a mother. To be a husband or a wife is mostly one's own concern; to be a parent affects
    others. A husband or a wife only touches his or her mate's personal happiness, but a
    parent influences the happiness of the next generation. The future of the children depends
    upon the parents. Therefore, the responsibility of parents is great. God has delivered our
    children's bodies, souls, thoughts, lives, and futures into our hands. No person can
    influence another's destiny more than parents can their children's. They can almost direct
    their children to heaven or to hell. How tremendously important their responsibility
    is....</font></p>
