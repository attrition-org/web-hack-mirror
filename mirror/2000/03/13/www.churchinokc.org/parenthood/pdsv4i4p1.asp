    GOD'S WISDOM TO US</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To be a parent requires that the totality of our human
    living be under the practice of opening ourselves absolutely to God in order that we may
    live by Him. We may know a lot about human psychology, and we may be well trained in the
    skills of communication, yet &quot;beside ourselves&quot; in the simplest matter of
    guiding our children in their daily living. But God has put us into Christ who is His
    wisdom to us (1 Cor. 1:30).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our Christian life is not primarily a matter of doctrine or
    teaching. To know what we should do is one thing; to experience the grace of the Lord to
    do it is something entirely different. We sometimes speak with parents who say, &quot;I
    hate myself for what I do to my children. I know that I should not lose my temper and deal
    with my children in anger, but when moments of frustration come, I am powerless to control
    my reactions.&quot; The key to meet this need is the enjoyment of Christ as God's wisdom
    to us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The article reviewed in this month's Parenthood relates to
    enjoying Christ as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption through experiencing Him
    as God's wisdom to us. Witness Lee illustrates how the enjoyment of Christ as wisdom
    impacts our marital relationships. In fact, all of our relationships, including the way in
    which we deal with and care for our children, require us to enjoy Christ in various
    aspects as stated in this article.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font face="Arial" size="2">As we call on the name of the
    Lord to simply enjoy Him, we will experience Him as our righteousness. We become righteous
    as He is righteous, and when we become righteous, we become calm. Calling on the name of
    the Lord also brings us into sanctification. When we are sanctified, we are made holy.
    This issues in a different atmosphere in our home, and we no longer react to our children;
    rather, we lead them, through our conduct and our living, to know God. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another of the items we enjoy in Christ is redemption. We are often
    far away from God in our daily living, but through redemption, we are brought back to God.
    Through redemption, we are also terminated and replaced. We have a wonderful provision
    given to us by God in Christ, our wisdom. May we learn to receive Him in all things.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In [First Corinthians] 1:24 Paul says, &quot;But to those
    who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God's power and God's wisdom.&quot; This is
    an important verse. Here Paul says that to those who are called, the ones who were chosen
    by God in eternity and who have come to believe in Christ, Christ is God's power and
    wisdom. As those who have been called by God to call on the name of the Lord, Christ is
    God's power and wisdom to us.</font></p>

        <td width="100%" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>Whenever we enjoy
        Christ and experience Him, we first have God as our righteousness.</b></i></font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In 1:30 Paul goes
    on to say, &quot;But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, Who became wisdom to us from God:
    both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&quot; Why does Paul, after pointing
    out that Christ is theirs and ours and that we have been called into His fellowship, say
    that this very Christ has become wisdom to us from God, both righteousness,
    sanctification, and redemption? We have seen that to be called into the fellowship of
    Christ means to be called into the co-enjoyment of Christ as our unique portion. In the
    second part of chapter one Paul shows us various aspects of the enjoyment of this
    wonderful portion....In verse 2 Paul speaks of our portion, and in verse 9 he tells us
    that we have been called into the enjoyment of this portion. Now in verses 24 and 30 we
    see the aspects of this portion for our enjoyment. From these verses we realize that we
    may enjoy Christ as God's wisdom and God's power. Furthermore, Christ as God's wisdom
    includes righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. My burden in this message is to
    consider from the standpoint of our experience how Christ is wisdom to us from God,
    including righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>THE DIVINE WAY</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is not easy to understand or explain wisdom,
    righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. I prefer to speak of these matters
    according to spiritual experience. In verses 24 and 30 the wisdom of God denotes the
    divine way. If we have wisdom, we shall know the proper way to do things. But if we are
    not wise, our way of doing things will be foolish. In order to have the best way, we must
    have wisdom. </font></p>
