    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">For the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose, the human
    vessel must be trained that it may become a container to receive God resulting in His
    divine attributes being expressed in human virtues. Of course, in our natural life, we are
    neither qualified nor are we able to stand righteously before God and man. Hence, we must
    receive Christ as our righteousness inwardly and put on Christ as our righteousness
    outwardly. Yet the human vessel as the container must be prepared to receive and express
    the life of God. This principle of preparing the human vessel to receive the life of God
    is seen in the law of God keeping His people &quot;under guardians and stewards until the
    time appointed by the father&quot; (Gal. 4:1-2). The purpose of the law is not to produce
    righteousness in its keepers; rather it is designed to &quot;shut up &quot; its hearers
    unto the faith (cf. Gal. 3:23 ff.).</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In the same principle, we must train our children to live a
    proper human life, i.e. to shut them up to the faith in the Lord Jesus. This training will
    both prepare the vessel to be a proper container and, at the same time, will give to the
    Holy Spirit the ground to convict them of righteousness, of sin, and of judgment at the
    time of their regeneration.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In this issue of Parenthood, we once more focus our
    attention on the recovery and training of man's conscience. Our children desperately need
    training and discipline to prepare them for salvation and to preserve them with a view to
    faith. In Matthew 5:23-26, the Lord Jesus taught His disciples to take care of any offense
    that a brother may have against them in a very serious way&#151;doing whatever is humanly
    possible to make peace with their brother. The Lord warned the disciples not to try to
    have a proper relationship with God while they were out of favor with their brothers. </font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Similarly, Paul urged us,
    &quot;Repay no one evil for evil; take forethought for things honorable in the sight of
    all men. If possible, as far as it depends on you, live in peace with all men&quot; (Rom.
    12:17-18). We should set an example of and teach our children to live by the light of the
    Word in all aspects of human living, at the same time praying that they may be preserved
    to be &quot;vessels of honor&#133;useful to the master, prepared unto every good
    work&quot; (2 Tim. 2:21).</font><br><br>

    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">After we have believed in the Lord, we must build up a
    habit of confessing and recompensing. If we have offended anyone or have come short of
    anyone, we should learn to confess or to recompense. On the one hand, we have to confess
    to God, and on the other hand, we have to confess to and recompense man. If a man does not
    confess to God nor apologize or recompense man, his conscience will easily become
    hardened. Once the conscience becomes hardened, a serious and fundamental problem
    develops: It becomes difficult for God's light to shine into a man. A person must build up
    a habit of confessing and making recompense so that he can maintain a sensitive and keen
    conscience before the Lord. (Watchman Nee, <i>Messages for Building Up New Believers</i>,
    Vol. 2, Chapter 22, p. 323)</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><i>Editor's note: In the October, 1999, edition of
    Parenthood, we reviewed the first half of Watchman Nee's fellowship concerning the
    maintaining of a clear conscience. We saw the need to take care of material debts owed to
    others through our negligence in the way we handle items put into our trust by others or
    through our acts of intentional defrauding of others. Brother Nee's sharing was based on
    Leviticus chapter six. </i></font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Now let us turn to another
    portion&#151;Matthew 5. This chapter is different from Leviticus 6, which speaks of
    transgressions against man just in terms of material things. Matthew 5 deals with more
    than just transgressions in material things.</font><p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Matthew
    5:23-26 says, &quot;Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you
    remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the
    altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
    Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way,
    lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be
    thrown into prison. Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until
    you pay the last quadrans.&quot; The quadrans spoken of here do not refer to just physical
    quadrans. They refer to the principle of coming up short in something.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The Lord says, &quot;Therefore, if you are offering your
    gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against
    you.&quot; This specifically refers to disputes among God's children and among the
    brothers. If you are offering a gift at the altar, that is, if you are offering something
    to God, and suddenly remember that your brother has something against you, this
    remembering is God's leading. The Holy Spirit often gives you a necessary thought and
    reminds you of necessary things. When you remember something or are reminded of something,
    do not put the thought aside and think that it is merely a thought. As soon as you
    remember something, you should carefully deal with it.</font></p>
