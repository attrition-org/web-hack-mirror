    of Character: Restrained in Speaking</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Our goal as Christian parents is to raise up children who
    will be useful to the Lord in the fulfillment of His plan and purpose. For one to be
    useful to the Lord, he or she must be trained up in character; the character of each of
    our children must be developed in a proper manner. Usefulness depends on the quality of
    one's character.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Watchman Nee in his book titled <i>The Character of the
    Lord's Worker</i>, points out that &quot;many are not qualified to do the Lord's
    work because of flaws in their character and personality&#133;.&quot; He goes on to warn
    that we &quot;should never despise the training of our character&#133;.None of the basic
    training in our character can be overlooked. If we are constituted in our character, we
    can work for the Lord. Without such a character, we cannot work for Him.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Among the aspects of character that are essential for the
    proper service to the Lord is that of being restrained in speaking. Brother Nee points out
    that many who would otherwise be very useful to the Lord have become useless because of
    their failure to restrict what they speak. James 3:10-11 asks, &quot;Out of the same mouth
    come forth blessing and cursing. These things, my brothers, ought not to be so. Does the
    spring, out of the same opening, gush forth the sweet and the bitter?&quot; Once again we
    realize that it is a grave responsibility to raise children for the Lord. We must find
    ways to train our children that they may have a deep sense of the value of speaking with
    honesty and propriety.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">In the fellowship from Brother
    Nee presented in this issue of Parenthood eight points connected with the matter of
    speaking are touched upon: the kind of talk people feel free to speak to us; the kind of
    words which we hear and readily believe; the kind of words that we pass along to others;
    inaccurate words; being intentionally double-tongued; dealing with our lust for
    information about others' lives and problems; gaining and maintaining people's
    trust by keeping the confidences shared with us; and paying special attention to the
    matter of lies.</font><p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">In order to train our children in the
    matter of restrained speaking, we first need to sanctify ourselves in our speaking.</font></p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" width="100%">
      <tr>
        <td align="center" width="100%"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><b>Restrained in Speaking</b></font></td>

    </table>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Many people could be very useful in the hand of God; they
    could be a powerful vessel to the Lord. Yet they remain useless to God, or they are used
    by Him in only a limited way. One of the main reasons for their failure is a lack of
    restraint in their speaking. We must remember that careless words are often the source of
    a leakage of power. Our words are like holes: They can be an outlet for God's power, or
    they can leak away His power. Our mouth can be the outlet through which God's power flows,
    or it can be a hole through which the divine power leaks away. Unfortunately, many people
    leak away God's power through their speaking.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">James 3:11 says that a spring
    cannot &quot;gush forth the sweet and the bitter&quot; at the same time. A worker of the
    Lord should send forth sweet and living water; he should be a conveyer of God's word.
    A water bucket cannot be used both for carrying drinking water and for dumping sewage. If
    the bucket for sewage is used to carry drinking water, it will become hazardous to health
    and life. In the same way, if our lips are consecrated for the utterance of God's word,
    then a solemn obligation is upon us to guard our lips for His service alone. Many people
    cannot be used by God, or they can only be used by God in a limited way, simply because
    their spring produces two kinds of water, sweet and bitter. They speak God's word with
    their mouth, and they also say many things which have nothing to do with God&#133;.</font>
<p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">There are several points connected with the matter of speaking, and
    we should take note of them. First, let us note before the Lord the kind of talk we hear
    all the time. The kind of talk we hear determines the kind of person we are. Many people
    will not tell you some things because they know that you are not like them, and it would
    be useless to say that thing to you. If a person readily shares certain things with you,
    he does it because he knows that you are of the same kind and that such things will
    produce a certain effect on you. You can know Yourself by noting the things that people
    relate to you all the time.</font></p>
