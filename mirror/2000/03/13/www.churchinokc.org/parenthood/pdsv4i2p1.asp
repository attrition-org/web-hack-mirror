    <p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">The apostle Paul instructed the fathers, &quot;do not
    provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the
    Lord&quot; (Eph. 6:4). The word translated &quot;nurture&quot; indicates to nourish, to
    provide for with tender care. The Greek word for &quot;discipline&quot; means to educate
    or to raise up a child in the proper way of child training. It suggests training by action
    and by restriction. The word &quot;admonition&quot;, on the other hand, indicates the
    training by word&#151;a word of encouragement if it is sufficient, but also a word of
    rebuke and correction when it is required. In the discipline of our children, the critical
    factor, then, is not punishment, but education through tender care and with firm resolve.
    The pattern for this type of discipline is our own heavenly Father as Paul taught in
    another of his epistles, the book to the Hebrews.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">In this issue of Parenthood, we consider some of the
    teaching of Watchman Nee concerning the discipline of our Father as seen in Hebrews
    12:6-8. He writes, &quot;Please bear in mind that the first reaction of God's children
    should be to respect and honor God's discipline. The first thing we should do when we
    experience something is to find the meaning of our experience&#133;.&quot; Our children,
    in the same way, must learn to respect and honor the instruction and teaching of their
    parents. This respect can only be imparted into our children when we follow the pattern of
    our Father.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Some of the key points of
    fellowship excerpted in this issue include the crucial fact that discipline is an
    arrangement of love. God arranges all of our circumstances in order to educate and train
    us in love. Discipline is the Father's education. A good father has in mind a clear set of
    guidelines to produce specific results. And, although God's discipline to us does involve
    some correction, it is not, strictly speaking, punishment. Rather, it is a kind of glory,
    the honor of being under the firm hand of our loving Father. So should it be with our
    discipline of our children. May we learn from this fellowship how to conduct our children
    to the Lord by way of careful, thoughtful discipline in love. Ignorance of proper
    discipline is a great loss to us and to our children.</font><br><br>

    </table>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">God's children should not regard lightly the discipline of
    the Lord. If the Lord disciplines us, we have to pay attention to it. Everything the Lord
    measures to us has a purpose and meaning to it. He wants to build us up through our
    experiences and environment. All of His discipline is for the purpose of perfecting us and
    making us holy. All of His discipline works His nature into our nature. As a result, we
    become disciplined in our character. This is the purpose of the Lord's discipline. He does
    not discipline us without reason. He disciplines us for the purpose of making us vessels.
    The Lord does not allow suffering to come to His children without a cause. We do not
    suffer for the purpose of suffering. He does not give us tribulation simply to make us
    suffer. The purpose in all our suffering is that we would partake of God's holiness and
    nature. This is the goal of discipline.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Many children of God have been
    Christians for eight or ten years, yet they have never given serious consideration to
    God's discipline. They never say, &quot;The Lord is disciplining me. He is dealing with
    me, chastising me, and molding me into a vessel.&quot; They do not see the purpose of
    God's chastisement, dealing, and carving work. They go through their experiences
    capriciously. They are not bothered by what they see today; they let it slip by. They are
    not bothered by what they see the next day; they are not concerned about what the Lord's
    will is, and they disregard it time after time. To them it is as if God purposelessly
    allows people to suffer. Please bear in mind that the first reaction of God's children
    should be to respect and honor God's discipline. The first thing we should do when we
    experience something is to find the meaning of our experience: Why have things happened
    this way? We must learn to respect and honor God's discipline. We should not regard it
    lightly. To regard it lightly is to be careless about it. It is to say that God can do
    whatever He wants to do and that we must simply go through these experiences mindlessly
    and aimlessly.</font><p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">On the one hand, we should not regard
    the discipline lightly. On the other hand, we should not make too much of it. If the
    Christian life became nothing but a story of suffering and frustration, it would be too
    much of a discouragement to us. This is to make too much of our discipline. We must learn
    to accept the discipline of the Lord and to see that His discipline and reproach are
    always meaningful. At the same time, we must not be discouraged by discipline.</font></p>
