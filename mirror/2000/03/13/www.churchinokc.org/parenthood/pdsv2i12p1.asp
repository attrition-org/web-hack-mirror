<p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In the previous issue of
    Parenthood we saw that according to the Bible God's salvation is for the entire
    household. We must learn to lay hold of the Word of God which tells us that His promise is
    to us and to our children (Acts 2:39). We must stand firmly in faith expecting that the
    Lord will bless our whole household with His salvation. But there is another side to the
    reaching of our families with God's salvation: Brother Witness Lee addressed this in
    a message printed in a book titled <u>Key Points On The Home Meetings</u>. He identifies
    the need for us to learn to be &quot;accommodating.&quot; The dictionary defines to
    accommodate as to give consideration to, or to allow for the special interests of various
    groups. It indicates the skill of harmonizing and integrating relationships. It is the
    ability to adapt oneself to care for the interest of others.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">To bring our children to the Lord requires not only that we
    believe the promises of the Lord concerning His salvation for our household. It requires
    us to be accommodating in our care for them in their souls. We should be &quot;like
    paste,&quot; that is we should be able to fit into anyone's situation and to attract
    them to our Lord. Many of us who genuinely love the Lord may, in our zeal for the Lord and
    His purpose, impose our faith upon those whom we love. The result often is turning them
    away from rather than drawing them to the Lord.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The unique way to be
    accommodating is through prevailing love. Love is the ultimate factor to bring others to
    know the Lord. It is the most excellent way. In 1996 Brother Lee spoke of prevailing love
    in a message about vital groups. He expressed his concern that we who are in the
    Lord's Recovery must fan into flame the gift of God which is in us. But he warns:
    &quot;If our spirit is not a spirit of love, our fanning it into flame will burn the whole
    recovery in a negative way We must have a burning spirit of love, not a burning spirit of
    authority which damages.&quot; In our care for our family, our natural zeal may greatly
    damage the ability of our family members to receive the Lord and His wonderful salvation.
    May we become accommodating in love.</font>
<p align="center"><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>Being
    Accommodating in Prevailing Love</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In Acts chapter ten, Cornelius sent for Peter. Before Peter
    arrived, Cornelius had called together his relatives and intimate friends, and they were
    waiting for Peter. This is a pattern for us to follow. When a home meeting is held in your
    house, the first people you should invite are your relatives and intimate friends. Fill
    the house with them.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In Acts 16:31, Paul told the jailer, &quot;Believe on the
    Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.&quot; In this verse we do not
    see any word concerning bringing a sheep. However, as soon as one believes in the Lord, he
    will immediately think of his household: his parents, wife, children, brothers, sisters,
    aunts, uncles, and cousins. All these are one's &quot;household.&quot; The scope of this
    household is extremely broad. Strictly speaking, this whole household is your
    &quot;kids.&quot; You must take them along&#133;.</font></td>

        <td align="center" width="100%" bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>We must bring people in,
        not by our zeal, but by our gentleness. Everyone who wants to bring in others should learn
        to be as yielding as paste.</b></font></td>

    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">&quot;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved,
    you and your household.&quot; You may extend the scope of the word household as widely as
    you like. I have seven families connected to me by marriage. And these seven families have
    more families connected to them by marriage. All these are our close relatives. We cannot
    see them die. We must bring them to salvation.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>The Need To Be Accommodating In Leading
    Others To Salvation</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Now you will probably tell me, &quot;Brother Lee, I have
    believed in the Lord for five years, but my wife absolutely refuses to believe.&quot; I
    have heard this kind of word. My answer to that is, &quot;Go home, and do not talk to her
    about Jesus any more; neither pray in her presence. She is tired of hearing about Jesus.
    You must find out what your wife wants from you. If she is upset about your coming home
    late at night, you have to learn the lesson. You should sacrifice the meeting a little to
    get home earlier.&quot; Perhaps you would say, &quot;Do you mean you want me to go home
    before the meeting is over?&quot; That is right. You either sacrifice the meeting or you
    sacrifice your wife. You have to choose between the two. To save your wife you must
    sacrifice the meeting. If you do this, after two months, your wife's opposition to Jesus
    will gradually go away.</font></p>
