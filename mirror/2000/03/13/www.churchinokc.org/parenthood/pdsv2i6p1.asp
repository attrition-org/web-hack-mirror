<center><font FACE="Arial" size="4"><b>Educating Our Children
    Concerning The Negative Elements of the World</b></font></center>
<p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">&quot;Gather
    me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me
    all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their
    children.&quot; Deut.&nbsp;4:10b</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">&quot;O that there were such an heart in them, that they
    would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and
    with their children for ever!&quot; Deut. 5:29</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">&quot;And these words, which I command thee this day, shall
    be in thine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children , and shalt talk
    of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou
    liest down, and when thou risest up.&quot; Deut. 6:6-7</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Johovah's instructions through Moses to the children
    of Israel gave clear instructions indicating that it is the responsibility of the parents
    to educate their children concerning God and His purpose both by their teaching and by
    their example. First, we must hear the Lord's words and learn to fear Him. Second, we
    must have a heart to keep always His commandments for our own sake and for the sake of the
    children the Lord has given us. Finally, we must practice to teach the Lord's words <b><i>diligently</i>
    </b>to our children in every kind of situation.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The majority of today's
    Christian parents have abandoned the education of their children to public or private
    education systems and to the television industry. Such training is often not only not
    helpful to them, but rather it damages them to live and have their being in the Lord.
    There are two principles in the universe, two sources of living, the natural and the
    spiritual. Our children must be taught in their knowledge about the acts of God, and in
    their conscience about the reality of God and Satan. They must know that before salvation,
    man lives in a state of deadness in spirit, active in the age of the world, under the
    dominion of the authority of the air, and in the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts.</font>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>DEAD IN OFFENSES AND SINS&#151;OUR BLACK BACKGROUND</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Chapter two [of Ephesians] describes a miserable situation,
    a situation that requires the rich mercy of God. In this message we shall be concerned
    with the first three verses of chapter two&#133;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>II. DEAD IN OFFENSES AND SINS</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>A. Dead Spiritually</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Verse 1 says that we were dead in our offenses and sins.
    The words &quot;being dead&quot; refer to the dead condition of our spirit, a death that
    pervades our entire being. We were not only fallen and sinful; we were dead.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">As I was preaching the gospel in
    Shanghai on New Year's Day in 1947, I said to the people, &quot;Friends, we Christian
    preachers must be honest and tell people what their real situation is. You are not only
    sinners&#151;all of you are dead. You are all in a coffin and in a tomb. You may regard
    yourselves as cultured ladies and gentlemen, but actually you are dead and buried in a
    tomb. I tell you this because now Christ wants to make you alive and raise you up out of
    your coffin.&quot; This is a good way to preach the gospel....</font><p><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>B. Having Lost the Function That Enables Us to Contact God</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">By being dead in offenses and sins, we lost the function
    that enables us to contact God. Spiritual death has annulled the function of our spirit.
    No matter how active we were in our body and soul, we were deadened in our spirit, unable
    to contact God.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>C. In Offenses and Sins</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Verse 1 says that we were dead in our offenses and sins.
    Offenses are acts that overstep the limit of right, and sins are evil doings. It was from
    such a background of death in our offenses and sins that we were saved to be the church,
    the Body. The dead have been made alive to be a living organism to express Christ.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">We need to say a further word about offenses. In running a
    race you must stay within the lines. To go outside the lines is to commit an offense. You
    have the right to run within the lines, but if you run outside the lines, you overstep
    your rights.</font></p>
