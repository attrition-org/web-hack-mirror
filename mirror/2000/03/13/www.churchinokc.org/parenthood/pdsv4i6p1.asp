    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In this issue of Parenthood, we consider the Lord's
    exhortation to the disciples in Matthew chapter 6:19-34. Commenting on this section of the
    Bible, Brother Witness Lee states, &quot;Your duty is to earn your degree and then to make
    riches. But do not seek to become a millionaire. Instead, be a good giver according to the
    life and nature of your heavenly Father. This is the meaning of this portion of the
    Word.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In their schoolwork, our children must learn to be
    industrious and diligent to achieve the highest grades and the top degrees. Education
    should be a major focus of every young person. At the same time we must guide them in such
    a way that they are not anxious concerning their labors. We must instruct them to rely
    fully on the supply that comes from their God, taking Him as both their source and their
    motivation. From the earliest days of their lives our children should know that they are
    fully dependent on the living God to realize their potential in everything and that they
    owe the fruits of their labor to Him. They have a duty to live to God, and they have a
    responsibility to take care of every human obligation as one who is a child of God. As
    Timothy who from a babe had &quot;known the sacred writings,&quot;&#151;2 Tim. 3:15, our
    children should know that they belong to the Lord.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The apostle Paul was one who
    discovered early in his Christian experience that he did not belong to himself. He told
    the Corinthian believers: &quot;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
    Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you have been
    bought with a price. So then glorify God in your body&quot;&#151;2 Cor. 6:19-20. When our
    children learn to labor with diligence, they will become achievers. With every
    achievement, they will have rewards. For example they may become successful in business
    endeavors and in other fields of labor. Then they will be begin to have a surplus of
    money. How will they use their surplus? Will they consume it on their own wants or will
    they learn to use it to serve the Lord and His purpose? The answer to this question
    depends on how we train our children and what example we set for them.</font><br><br>

    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In [Matthew 6:25] the Lord tells us not to be anxious about
    our life. The Greek word translated &quot;life&quot; here is soul, in which is the desire,
    the appetite, for food and clothing (Isa. 29:8). Our life is more than food, and our body
    is more than clothing. Both our life and our body came into existence by God, not by our
    anxiety. Since God has created us with a life and a body, surely He will care for their
    needs. The kingdom people do not need to be anxious about these things.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>Not Being
    Anxious About Eating, Drinking, and Clothing</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Verse 31 says, &quot;Therefore do not be anxious, saying,
    What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?&quot; Here
    we come to the crucial matter in verses 19 through 34. Apparently, in this section of the
    constitution, the Lord is speaking about the dealing of the kingdom people with material
    riches. Actually, He is dealing with the matter of anxiety. The Lord is wise. After
    touching our temper, lust, natural being, self, and flesh, He goes on to touch our
    anxiety. In these verses the word &quot;anxious&quot; is used six times (vv. 25, 27, 28,
    31, 34). It may also seem that the Lord is touching our heart, for where our treasure is,
    there our heart is also. However, our heart is related not only to riches, but to many
    other things.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is composed
    with the Father's life and nature. Although these chapters do not actually use the words
    &quot;life&quot; and &quot;nature,&quot; from the context we can see that apart from the
    Father's divine life and nature, these chapters are in vain&#133;.</font></p>
