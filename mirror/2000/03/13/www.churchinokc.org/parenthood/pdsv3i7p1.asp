    Our Children According To God's Nature</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The way in which we discipline our children is as varied as
    the number of parents. Many Christian parents are troubled by the seeming emphasis on
    physical discipline described in Proverbs. For example: &quot;He that spares his rod hates
    his son; but he that loves him is diligent to discipline him&quot; (Prov. 13:24). Even
    stronger is the word in chapter 23, verses 13 and 14: &quot;Withhold not correction from
    the child, for if you beat him with the rod, he shall not die. You shall beat him with the
    rod, and shall deliver his soul from hell.&quot; These admonitions to parents fly straight
    in the face of today's generally accepted philosophy of child rearing popular among
    the educators and child psychologists.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">There is, of course, reason for concern about the violence
    that is loosed upon children in the name of discipline. We have all been disturbed by the
    terrible things perpetrated upon children that have been reported in our daily newspapers.
    The Bible certainly does not advocate violence toward children. However, the use of a good
    switch which stings but neither breaks bones nor leaves ugly bruises is not equal to the
    maiming and killing acts which have been inflicted on children by the unbelieving and
    psychologically damaged parents.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Although we agree with the exhortations in the Bible which
    call for physical consequences to children who are at fault in unacceptable behavior, we
    are not offering here a way nor a philosophy for disciplining children. Rather, we are
    presenting a principle of discipline, <i>disciplining our children according to God</i>.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Brother Witness Lee wrote,
    &quot;We may discipline our children without God, only according to our likes or dislikes.
    When we hear this fellowship, we may think that God does not want us to discipline our
    children. This is also wrong. We are not saying that God does not want us to discipline
    our children. What we need to see is that God wants us to discipline our children with
    Him. This is a difficult lesson for all of us to learn.&quot;</font>
<p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">We need to cooperate with the Lord in His renewing process in us. We have been
    regenerated with the life of God. In this divine life there is a renewing capacity to make
    us one with God.</font></p>

      <tr>

        Children According To God's Nature</b></font></td>

    </table>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The New Testament says that God chose us before the
    foundation of the world and marked us out (Eph. 1:4-5). He desires to make His chosen ones
    the new creation. His way to do this is first to put Himself into us, to regenerate us. We
    are reborn, regenerated, to become God's children. This is wonderful, but the New
    Testament reveals that regeneration alone is not adequate. After regenerating us, God has
    to renew us, sanctify us, transform us, conform us to His image, and glorify us.
    Transformation needs sanctification and also renewing. Transformation is a metabolic
    change. When we are transformed, a new element is added to us metabolically to replace the
    old element. The new element is God Himself. God is &quot;new&quot; (as a noun). There is
    no oldness with God.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">After we have been regenerated,
    we have God, but we do not have much of God. This is why Colossians 2:19 says that we need
    to grow with the growth of God, or increase with the increase of God. This means that we
    grow by the increase of God within us. If we have little increase of God, we grow little.
    If we have much increase of God, we grow much. When we have God in us to the fullest, we
    will have the full growth. God has to be increased within us. When God is increasing
    within us, His new element is being added into us. When the divine element comes into us,
    it renews us regardless of whether we are slow or quick in our natural disposition. As we
    are contacting God, God infuses Himself as the divine element into our being. This new
    element is added into our existing element. When this new element is added into us,
    something is worked out within us.</font>
<p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">God desires to add
    Himself into our being, but He does not increase in us when we do not contact Him. We may
    go through a period of time in which we do not contact God or pray to Him. Instead, we are
    doing everything by ourselves and in ourselves. During this time, God is not added into
    our being, and we are not increasing with the increase of God. This is why we encourage
    all the saints to have morning watch. Our morning watch with the Lord is not just for us
    to exercise our mind to read the letter of the Bible, but it is for us to exercise our
    spirit. This is why we have to say, &quot;O Lord Jesus.&quot; Our calling on the Lord is
    our spiritual breathing. We have to contact God by praying to Him and calling on Him. Then
    He adds Himself into us. When we contact Him, He is adding more and more of the divine
    element into our being. As the new element of God is being added into our being, this new
    element metabolically renews us. I may be a quick person naturally, but because God's
    element comes into my being, this element renews my natural habit. I may be slow in my
    natural disposition, but God renews me with His element to discharge my old element.</font></p>
