<center><font FACE="Arial" size="4"><b>COMFORTING THEIR HEARTS</b></font></center>
<p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The Apostle Paul presented himself to the new believers in
    Thessalonica as a nursing mother who would cherish her own children (1 Thess. 1:7). His
    nourishing and cherishing care for the churches was a reflection and pattern of a
    mother's care for her own. If we pay our full attention to how he cared for the
    churches, we will learn much about the way that we as parents should care for our
    children.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In this issue of <i>Parenthood</i> we will consider how
    Paul labored to present every man full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28-29), with struggling
    that their hearts might be comforted and knit together in love. The fellowship from
    Witness Lee in the <i>Life-Study of Colossians</i>, message seventeen, gives some helpful
    insights into the principles which governed the work of the apostle with the believers.
    These principles can serve us well when they are applied to the care of our children.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The first principle highlighted in this message is the
    principle of laboring. If we fail to labor in the care of our children, we will never
    realize the goal of presenting them full grown in Christ. This must be our goal and our
    labor. But the second half of this principle is that as we labor, we must pray for the
    blessing of the Lord on all that we do. Man must till the ground, but only God can send
    the rain.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Another principle is struggling
    with the purpose that the hearts of our children may be comforted. Many times parents are
    traumatized by the behavior of their children to the point that they may deal with them in
    harsh anger, sometimes full of bitter accusations. There may be little thought of how we
    affect the hearts of the young ones. In contrast, Paul's labor was that &quot;their
    hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full
    assurance of understanding....&quot; Undergirding our firm discipline must be an
    unwavering love with discerning care. We need His operation in us in power (Col. 1:29).</font>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial">STRUGGLING ACCORDING TO THE OPERATION OF CHRIST</font></b></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">We have pointed out that Paul labored to present every man
    full-grown in Christ. Presenting others full-grown in Christ is a very difficult task, a
    task which can be accomplished only by struggling according to Christ's operation.</font></p>
    <div align="center"><center><table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>On the one hand, we must till the ground. On the other
        hand, only God can send the rain.</b></font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center></div></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top">
<center><font face="Arial"><b>THE PRINCIPLE ORDAINED BY GOD</b></font></center>
<p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Some may think that the way to present others full-grown in Christ
    is to pray. However, it is possible to have a superstitious understanding of prayer. For
    example, suppose someone thinks that meals can be prepared only by prayer and that there
    is no need to go shopping or to cook food. Such a concept is superstitious. In presenting
    others full-grown in Christ we need to follow the principle set up in Genesis 2: Man tills
    the ground, and God sends the rain (v. 5). On the one hand, we must till the ground. On
    the other hand, only God can send the rain. As we trust in God and look to Him for the
    rain, we should be faithful in our responsibility to till the ground. This means that we
    must fulfill the principle ordained by God. If we depend only on our work of tilling the
    ground and do not trust in the Lord to send the rain, we are wrong. But we are also wrong
    if we only pray to the Lord for rain and do not fulfill our responsibility to till the
    ground. Applying this principle to the matter of presenting every man full-grown in
    Christ, we see that we should not merely pray, but also labor according to Christ's
    operation.</font></p>
