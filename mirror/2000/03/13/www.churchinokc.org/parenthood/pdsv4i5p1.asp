    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The Lord Jesus focused His full attention on the carrying
    out of His Father's will. He, as the Christ of God, came to do the Father's will. At the
    center of the Father's will was the building up of the church as the Lord revealed in
    Matthew chapter 16. In this chapter, we see not only the unveiling of the Lord Jesus as
    the Christ, the Son of the Living God, but we also see that He will build His church and,
    with this goal in view he will give the keys of the kingdom of the heavens to Peter (and,
    in principle, to the rest of the disciples). But the one crucial aspect of this momentous
    revelation, a fact often overlooked by Christian teachers, is the principle that the
    building up of the church is accomplished only through death and resurrection. The
    scripture tells us that <i>from that time</i> Jesus began to show to His disciples that He
    was going to Jerusalem where He would suffer many things, eventually be killed and then
    rise from the dead on the third day.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">This shocking disclosure received an immediate response of
    disbelief and rejection by Peter. Then the Lord indicated to Peter that not only the Lord
    would suffer in such a way, but that anyone who would follow the Lord must also suffer in
    the same way&#151;&quot;let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow
    Me&quot;&#151;Matthew 16:24. At the very heart of taking up our cross is the matter of
    losing our soul. The losing of the soul allows the Lord to gain what He is after. This is
    a principle for the building up of the church which is subsequently revealed to be the
    organic Body of Christ (see Ephesians 1:22-23).</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">We need to see that the losing of
    the soul is essential for the building up of the Body of Christ and even for the
    establishing of a normal and proper married and family life. In this issue of Parenthood,
    we receive the fellowship concerning this crucial matter of the losing of our soul. We are
    told that, &quot;It is difficult even for a husband and wife or for parents and children
    to be built up together. We all want enjoyment for ourselves and react against anything
    that touches our sense of enjoyment.&quot; In fact this principle of the losing of the
    soul is the key to achieving and maintaining a proper family life. May we as parents take
    the lead to lose our soul that our children may gain their soul in eternity.</font><br><br>

    <p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><i><b>Then Jesus said to His disciples, If
    anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.
    For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for
    My sake shall find it. For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but
    forfeits his soul-life? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life? Matthew
    16:24-26</b></i></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Verse 25 [above] says, &quot;For whoever desires to save
    his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find
    it.&quot; This verse begins with the word &quot;For,&quot; indicating that it is an
    explanation of the previous verses. The Greek word rendered &quot;soul-life&quot; or
    &quot;life&quot; (KJV) is <i>psuche</i>, the word for soul. Although it is correct to
    render this word as &quot;soul-life,&quot; it can also be rendered &quot;soul.&quot;
    Actually, this translation is preferable here. Rendered this way, verse 25 speaks of the
    saving and the losing of the soul. There is a difference between the soul and the
    soul-life. The soul is our natural being, whereas the soul-life is our human life. These
    two are inseparable.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>THE SOUL AND
    THE SELF</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Luke 9:25 says, &quot;For what is a man advantaged, if he
    gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?&quot; This verse does not speak
    of the soul or the soul-life, but the self. When this verse is compared with Matthew 16:26
    we see that the soul is the self and that the self is the soul. However, there is still a
    difference between the soul and the self. According to the context of Matthew 16, the self
    in verse 24 is the embodiment and expression of the soul in verse 25. Moreover, the
    expression of the self is mainly through the mind. For this reason, verse 23 speaks of
    setting the mind on the things of men, not on the things of God. Therefore, in verses 23,
    24, and 25 respectively we have the mind, the self, and the soul. The soul is embodied in
    the self, and the self is expressed through the mind.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In verse 25 the word soul indicates enjoyment. If you
    consider the context of verses 25 through 27, you will see that the Lord is speaking about
    the enjoyment of the soul. To save the soul is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment.
    Thus, the self is the expression of the soul, and the soul itself is the enjoyment. To
    lose the soul means to lose the enjoyment of the soul, and to gain the soul means to have
    the enjoyment of the soul.</font></p>
