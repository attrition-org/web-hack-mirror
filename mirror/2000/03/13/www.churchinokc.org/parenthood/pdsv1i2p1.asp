    <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">In our first issue of Parenthood, we saw the responsibility
    of being a parent: &quot;God has delivered our children&#146;s bodies, souls, thoughts,
    lives, and futures into our hands. No person can influence another&#146;s destiny more
    than parents can their children&#146;s&quot; (Watchman Nee, <i>Do All To The Glory Of God</i>,
    p. 72). God has committed to us our children as a divine stewardship. He will demand an
    accounting from us of how we cared for these children whom He has entrusted to us. The
    scriptures charge us to nurture our children in the discipline and admonition of the Lord
    (Eph. 6:4). In this issue we will begin to consider some aspects of the carrying out of
    the Lord&#146;s charge.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">In the United States, rebellion is a major factor which is
    influencing and, in many cases, corrupting our children. As parents in the Lord&#146;s
    Recovery, it is our responsibility to not only learn to know and respect the authority of
    God, but to infuse this same characteristic into our families. Rebellion can only be
    displaced when we, the children of the Lord, learn to be in submission to authority. To
    strengthen our awareness of the central significance of the Lord&#146;s authority in the
    universe, we have included in this issue a portion from <i>Authority and Submission</i>,
    written by Watchman Nee.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">However, whenever we speak of
    training our children to submit to authority, we may encounter resistance from some
    parents. They may feel that because Christ must replace all the aspects of our natural
    man, we should not develop the natural strengths of our children.</font><p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">Although it is true that Christ eventually must replace all the
    natural things, it is essential that we realize that man&#146;s natural virtues must first
    be developed in order that they may become the containers of the divine attributes.
    Children must learn to know and obey authority, realizing that all authority has its
    source in God (Rom. 13:1-7). We have included a message given by Witness Lee from the
    Life-Study of Colossians which points to the proper use of culture for the essential
    growth and development of our children.</font></p>

    <td width="30%" valign="top"><center><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>THE IMPORTANCE OF AUTHORITY</b></font></center>
<p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">God's works issue from God's throne; God's throne is established
    upon authority. All things have been created by the authority of God, and all laws on
    earth are held together through authority. Hence, the Bible says that God upholds all
    things by the word, which is of His authority; it does not say that God upholds all things
    by His power. God's authority represents God Himself; God's power only represents God's
    works. It is easy to be forgiven of sin against God's power, but it is not that easy to be
    forgiven of sin against God's authority, for to sin against God's authority is to sin
    against God Himself. In the whole universe only God is authority. All other authorities
    are appointed by God. Nothing is greater than authority in the universe; nothing can
    surpass it....</font></p>

    He wanted to compete with God and to stand in opposition to God. Rebellion is the cause of
    the fall of Satan.</font></p>
