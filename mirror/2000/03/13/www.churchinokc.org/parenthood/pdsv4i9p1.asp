    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Our conscience is critical to the proper living and
    testifying of God in man. Paul, in his earnest contention with the Sanhedrin, declared,
    &quot;I have conducted myself in all good conscience before God until this
    day&quot;&#151;Acts 23:1. Later in this same book of Acts, he confirmed, &quot;I also
    exercise myself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and
    men&quot;&#151;Acts 24:16. Elsewhere, he lamented that &quot;in later times some will
    depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons by means
    of the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, of men who are branded in their own conscience as
    with a hot iron&quot;&#151;1 Tim. 4:1-2. Man's conscience was greatly damaged through the
    four stages of man's fall as recorded in the book of Genesis. As man fell, his conscience
    became more and more seared as with a hot branding iron. As a result men were emboldened
    to do things increasingly wicked and profane without the slightest feeling of violation of
    their consciences.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In this issue of Parenthood, we are focusing on the need
    for man's conscience to be recovered and to be sensitized and trained. Witness Lee writes,
    &quot;It is a good thing that human beings are able to feel shameful. If I stole a certain
    thing and then was able to boast about it, that would be terrible. If I steal something, I
    should feel ashamed of it. But so many young people today have no feeling of shame. They
    are not ashamed of their evil doings. But shamefulness is a protection for fallen man; it
    is a part of the function of our conscience.&quot;</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The recovery of man's conscience
    begins with a clear and definite training for the young child in the matters of proper
    behavior. A child should be taught from his youth to care for the right principles of
    conduct in all things: respect for authority, honoring of parents, caring for others,
    controlling of temper, observing of courtesy, etc. The child must also be trained by the
    example of his or her parents in their normal daily activities. Proper behavior and
    obedience can never produce a God-man. Only the life of God in man can regenerate him and
    enable him to live in oneness with God. But the forming of a proper character in a child
    through the development and training of the conscience will preserve him a vessel ready to
    receive Christ.</font><br><br>

    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In this message we come to chapter eleven of Genesis.
    According to the divine record in the book of Genesis, mankind has had four falls. The
    first fall was that of Adam in chapter three, the second was that of Cain in chapter four,
    and the third was that of the crooked and perverse generation before the deluge recorded
    in chapter six. Now, in chapter eleven, we see man's fourth fall (vv. 1-9). These four
    falls continued one after another. Here in the fourth fall the subtlety of the enemy is
    exposed. This fall occurred after the flood. It transpired on the new earth after the
    restoration of human life under the headship of Noah. As we have seen, that life was a
    type of the life in resurrection. Man's fourth fall had such a background.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>1. The Cause
    of Man's Fourth Fall</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Behind each of the four falls there was one common unique
    source&#151;Satan, the enemy of God. You may ask, &quot;Is not God the Almighty One? Since
    He is the Almighty One, why did He not destroy this enemy? It would have been so easy for
    Him to do it.&quot; But even God's enemy is at least somewhat useful in God's economy.
    Although God's economy has so many positive things in white, it needs some negative things
    in black to show the whiteness of the white&#133;.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Many philosophers have written books about the condition of
    man on earth. All of their writings are nonsense; not one of them has hit the mark.
    However, when we come to the Bible, we find that it is filled with facts and with the
    divine revelation. Not one word is wasted. For example, the first two chapters of Genesis
    reveal God's purpose and the relationship between God and man. In the next eight and a
    half chapters, from Genesis 3 to the middle of Genesis 11, we find the record of man's
    four falls. In the fourth fall man fell to the uttermost. No fall can go beyond this. This
    means that in the fourth fall of man, the enemy of God, Satan, has done his worst. He can
    do nothing more. He did everything within his limit that he could possibly do, using every
    available means to bring about man's fourth fall.</font></p>
