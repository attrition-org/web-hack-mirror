    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>To be a parent</b> is
    one of the highest privileges and at the same time one of the most frightening
    responsibilities of a human being. God, in His wisdom created us with the capacity to
    produce, nurture, and bring to maturity our own offspring. But our children have the
    capacity to bring out in us both the highest, most noble humanity and the lowest
    expression of human degradation. In order to fully carry out our role as parents, we need
    to experience the Spirit of God living and working within us to make us righteous, a
    condition in which everything is in proper order.</font>
<p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">The condition of being righteous comes from the infusion of God into our being
    through the ministry of the New Testament. By means of this new covenant ministry, the
    life-giving Spirit, Who indwells the believers in Christ, dispenses Christ into us to make
    us one with Him. The result is righteousness, a state in which you are living, acting and
    having your being in the Triune God.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">If you are infused and
    saturated by the life-giving Spirit, your inner being will become transparent. Then you
    will know what is in the Lord's mind. You will also understand what the will of the
    Lord is. Spontaneously, you will be in His will and do His will. As a result, you become
    right with Him. Moreover, you will realize how you should act toward others and even how
    you should deal with your material possessions. Then you will become a righteous person,
    one who is right in small things as well as in great things, one who is right with God,
    with others, and with himself. This is a person who expresses God, for his righteousness
    is the image of God, God expressed. (Witness Lee, <i>Life-Study of 2 Corinthians #27</i>,
    pp. 242-243)</font>
<p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">In this issue of Parenthood, we
    consider the condition of righteousness dispensed into us by the Spirit through the new
    covenant ministry and its issue in our family life. By the divine operation of the
    life-giving Spirit in us, we can become those who are able to care for our children in
    peace even in the most difficult circumstances. When everything is in good order, our
    family living will be the expression of God.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top">
<center><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>Righteousness and the
    Kingdom</b></font></center>
<p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Romans 14:17 says, &quot;For the
    kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy
    Spirit.&quot; In this verse Paul gives us another aspect of righteousness. In Romans 8 we
    have righteousness related to the Spirit of life and issuing in the image of the Son of
    God. But in Romans 14:17 righteousness is related to the kingdom of God. In this chapter
    the kingdom of God denotes the church life. The meetings of the church are an exhibition
    of the kingdom of God. In the church life we have a condition and a situation that shows
    others what the kingdom of God is. The church life is the kingdom of God, and the kingdom
    of God is righteousness.</font></p>
