    size="4"><b>Principles for a Proper Human Life </b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Children must be trained concerning the principles for a
    proper human life. The book of Proverbs is a proficient support in providing a basis for
    training in appropriate human living. But to properly use the book of Proverbs, we need to
    realize the nature of the book. Brother Witness Lee in his life-study of Proverbs points
    out: &quot;What the book of Proverbs is to us and what the entire Bible is to us depend on
    what kind of person we are. For the apostle Paul every book of the Old Testament was
    Spirit and life.&quot; For many of today's Christians the book of Proverbs is merely a
    book of ethics&#151;teachings concerning moral practices. As believers, however, we should
    approach every book of the Bible as a book of Spirit and life. Nevertheless, the
    instructions in the book of Proverbs related to upright human living can be strongly
    instrumental in the training of our children as the base for their human life. Through the
    proper application of the teachings in Proverbs we will also provide them with a sound
    preparation for them to receive the life of the Lord through regeneration. We, who have
    come to acutely realize that we cannot earn our own salvation, may fail to instill into
    our children a respect for human virtues. Thus, We may be in danger of neglecting the
    essential training that children need in basic principles for proper human living. Parents
    should be thoughtful and in much prayer, asking the Lord to show them how to implant in
    their children a reverence for God, including fearing God, trusting Him, and honoring Him.
    Witness Lee, commenting on this principle of revering God writes, &quot;To revere God is
    to consider and regard Him in everything never forgetting that He is the wonderful God who
    has created us.&quot; </font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">We must also teach our children
    that we, the people of His creation, need to seek our Creator's wisdom in all things. They
    should learn to ask the Lord for clear guidance in all matters pertaining to their human
    life. We should infuse them with an appreciation for the wisdom that God displays in His
    vast creation (Rom. 1:19-20). And we must imbue them with the reality that all real wisdom
    is hidden in Christ (Col. 2:2-3). Finally, they must be taught to honor their parents. To
    honor our parents is to remember our real source, that is, God Himself.</font><table

    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In this message we will consider from Proverbs the
    principles for man to live a proper human life. Each of these principles&#151;revering
    God, needing wisdom, and honoring one's parents&#151;is a nugget.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>I. REVERING GOD</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The first principle for man to live a proper human life is
    revering God. We should not only worship God but also revere Him. To revere God is to
    consider and regard Him in everything never forgetting that He is the wonderful God who
    has created us. When we are about to lose our temper, we should revere God. Revering God
    stops us from doing evil. Revering God also causes us to be touched by the sufferings of
    others and to show mercy and compassion to them&#133;.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>A. Fearing God</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">To revere God is to fear God. The fear of Jehovah is the
    beginning of knowledge and wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding
    (1:7; 9:10; 15:33a). Knowledge, wisdom, and understanding come from God. If we fear Him,
    revering Him, these will be our possession. </font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">If we seek wisdom like silver and
    search for her like hidden treasures, then we will understand the fear of Jehovah and find
    the knowledge of God (2:4-5). The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil (8:13). The fear of
    Jehovah prolongs days, but the years of the wicked will be shortened (10:27). He who walks
    in his uprightness fears Jehovah, but he who is perverse in his ways despises Him (14:2).
    In the fear of Jehovah is strong confidence, and his children will have a place of refuge.
    The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, that one may turn aside from the snares of
    death (vv. 26-27). Better is a little with the fear of Jehovah, than great treasure and
    turmoil with it (115:16). If we are rich in the fear of Jehovah, we will have peace.</font><p
    ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>B. Trusting in God</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">To revere God is also to trust in Him. Proverbs 3:5-8
    charges us to trust in Jehovah with all our heart and not to rely on our own
    understanding. In all our ways we should acknowledge Him, and He will make our paths
    straight. We should not be wise in our own eyes; we should fear Jehovah and depart from
    evil. This will be healing to our body and refreshment to our bones&#133;.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">According to 3:26 Jehovah will be our confidence, and He
    will keep our foot from being caught. Every word of God is tried; He is a shield to those
    who take refuge in Him. We should not add to His words, lest He reprove us and we be found
    a liar (30:5-6). We must not change His word by adding something to it according to our
    point of view. This is dangerous.</font></p>
