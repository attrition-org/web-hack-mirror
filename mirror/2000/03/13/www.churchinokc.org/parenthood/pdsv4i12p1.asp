    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Why do people often live in an immoral and even an
    aggressively evil, manner? It is because of the lack of inward restriction. Internal
    restrictions are formed and applied primarily through the actions of education and
    training. Unfortunately, many school systems in numerous countries of the world today, are
    teaching philosophies that damage and even destroy the restrictions that were deemed
    &quot;normal&quot; aspects of proper human living thirty to fifty years ago. So-called
    &quot;affective education&quot; stresses programs such as &quot;values clarification&quot;
    to eliminate all objective standards of morality and all respect for parental values.
    Programs that promote self-esteem by teaching students to &quot;feel good&quot; about
    themselves (without reference to any standard of behavior or achievement) destroy the very
    fabric of proper human living and endorse a looseness of character.
    &quot;Comprehensive&quot; sexual education programs break down modesty and self-discipline
    resulting in widespread promiscuity among teens and in a society of adults in which
    fornication and adultery are redefined as, if not appropriate, at least acceptable choices
    among &quot;consenting adults.&quot; Secular humanism systematically excludes God and is
    highly intolerant of all religious beliefs and moral standards. The consequence is a world
    in which evil is called good and good is called evil.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">How can we protect our children
    from this nonsensical teaching and instill in them the proper restrictions? It is by
    speaking. The spoken word is powerful! The things that we hear and speak shape our
    character. In this issue of Parenthood we will review what the Bible says concerning the
    source of evil and the way to be restricted from doing evil. We will see five items in the
    way of restriction: knowing God by His creation, holding the truth of God in
    righteousness, living according to our divinely created nature, listening to our
    conscience, and caring for our proper reasonings. We should study these points and learn
    to speak them to our children <i>repeatedly day by day</i>. May we be like the apostle
    Paul who &quot;did not withhold any of those things that are profitable by not declaring
    them&#133;and by not teaching&quot;&#151;Acts 20:20. May we &quot;night and day,&#133;not
    cease admonishing each one with tears&quot;&#151;v. 31</font><br><br>

    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In this message we will cover the source of wickedness
    shown in the condemnation of mankind and the way of restriction shown in the condemnation
    of the self-righteous&#133;.Although we do not want to dwell upon the subject of
    condemnation, there are two points related to it that are quite important. First is the
    source of evil, the source of wickedness. Because of this source mankind is evil. Thus, in
    this message we will see the source of man's wickedness. Second, we need to see the way of
    restriction. There is a way to restrict this wickedness. Since we have been saved from
    condemnation, we need not give it much attention. However, we need to return to it long
    enough to learn the source of evil and the way to restrict evil.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>I. THE
    CONDEMNATION ON MANKIND</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Now we need to consider the source of wickedness. This
    section of Romans (1:18-32) reveals four elements of the source of evil.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>A. Holding Down the Truth in
    Unrighteousness</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The first element in the source of wickedness is holding
    down the truth in unrighteousness (1:18). What is truth? Truth is not mere doctrine or
    knowledge. Truth is reality; it is solid and substantial. There is reality in this
    universe, and the prime reality is God Himself. To say that there is no God is to speak
    vanity; to declare the reality of God is to speak something solid, substantial, genuine,
    and true. God is real. No one can deny the reality of God or disclaim the fact that He
    exists, for the existence of God is a reality. However, from the very beginning, mankind
    did not respect the reality of God, but suppressed it.&#133;In the United States today we
    behold evil on every side, and the newspapers are filled with wicked and shameful things.
    Why are there so many shameful things in the leading country of the world? Because so many
    people will not maintain the truth, but instead, wrongfully hold it down. This is the most
    significant aspect of the source of wickedness.</font></p>
