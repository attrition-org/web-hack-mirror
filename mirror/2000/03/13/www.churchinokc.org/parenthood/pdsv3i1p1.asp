    Authority</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The throne of God is established on authority. Everything
    in the universe is upheld and operates under His divine authority. If we do not realize
    the authority of God in our daily living, we can never carry out the responsibility God
    has bestowed on us as parents. We must know authority.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The world today is filled with contention, rivalry, hatred,
    and strife sometimes elevating to the point of physical violence. Brother Watchman Nee
    wrote concerning the problem of authority and rebellion in the book entitled <u>Authority
    and Submission</u>, &quot;The center of dispute in the whole universe hinges on who has
    the authority. We have to contend with Satan by asserting that authority is with God. We
    have to set ourselves to submit to God's authority and to uphold God's
    authority. We must meet God's authority face-to-face and have a basic realization of
    it.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The contention over the issue of authority touches every
    aspect of our living. It affects our marriages. God has ordained that man is the head of
    the woman (1 Cor. 11:3). This is a simple, straightforward statement in the Bible which
    every Christian acknowledges to be the Word of God. Yet, there is a resistance and many
    times a direct rebellion against this principle. The reason for this is that many wives
    have never met the authority of the Lord. There is no recognition that God has placed His
    authority with delegates who are responsible to carry out this authority under the
    headship of Christ (1 Cor. 11:3). On the part of the husband there is the equal lack of
    revelation concerning God's authority. Consequently, men often seek to subdue their
    wives by the power of persuasion rather than remaining under authority to represent the
    Lord in their marital relationships.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In the raising up of our
    children, we have the crucial responsibility of standing with the authority of God. We
    must educate our children not only concerning the direct authority of God, but also train
    them to recognize the delegated authority which God places upon persons in the world, the
    church, the family, the school. May the Lord be merciful to us to reveal to us His
    authority.<br><br></font>

    </table>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">God's works issue from God's throne; God's throne is
    established upon authority. All things have been created by the authority of God, and all
    laws on earth are held together through authority. Hence, the Bible says that God upholds
    all things by the word, which is of His authority; it does not say that God upholds all
    things by His power. God's authority represents God Himself; God's power only represents
    God's works. It is easy to be forgiven of sin against God's power, but it is not that easy
    to be forgiven of sin against God's authority, for to sin against God's authority is to
    sin against God Himself. In the whole universe only God is authority. All other
    authorities are appointed by God. Nothing is greater than authority in the universe;
    nothing can surpass it. For this reason, if we want to serve God, we must know God's
    authority.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>SATAN'S BEGINNING</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Satan became Satan because he overstepped God's authority.
    He wanted to compete with God and to stand in opposition to God. Rebellion is the cause of
    the fall of Satan.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Both Isaiah 14:12-15 and Ezekiel
    28:13-17 speak about the transgression and the fall of Satan. Isaiah chapter fourteen
    tells us that Satan violated God's authority, while Ezekiel chapter twenty-eight tells
    that he violated God's holiness. To violate God's authority is a matter of rebellion; it
    is more serious than to violate God's holiness. Sin is a matter of conduct; it is easy to
    be forgiven of sin. But rebellion is a matter of principle; it is not easy to be forgiven
    of rebellion. Satan, in trying to set up his throne above that of God's, has violated
    God's authority. The principle of Satan is the principle of self-exaltation. Sin's coming
    into being is not the cause of Satan's fall. Rather it is because [Satan] rebelled against
    God's authority and was condemned by God that gave the subsequent rise of sin&#133;.</font>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>ALL DISPUTES IN THE UNIVERSE BEING A MATTER
    OF AUTHORITY</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The center of dispute in the whole universe hinges on who
    has the authority. We have to contend with Satan by asserting that authority is with God.
    We have to set ourselves to submit to God's authority and to uphold God's authority. We
    must meet God's authority face-to-face and have a basic realization of it&#133;.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">God exercises the utmost of His strength to uphold His
    authority. His authority is stronger than anything else. We who are so self-confident, who
    in reality are so blind, have to come face-to-face at least once with God's authority.
    Only when we are broken can we come into submission. Then we will begin to learn what
    God's authority is. Only when a man meets God's authority will he submit to the deputy
    authority that God appoints. (Watchman Nee, <i>Authority and Submission</i>, pp. 7-10,
    Published by Living Stream Ministry, December, 1988)</font></p>
