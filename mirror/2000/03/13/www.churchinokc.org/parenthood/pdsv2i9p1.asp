    a Vision</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Although we must educate our children concerning their
    living as proper human beings, especially in regard to their relationship with the
    opposite sex, we must not lose sight of the economy of God. We are not simply trying to
    keep our children from becoming sinful in their behavior. We are training them to become
    valuable members of the Body of Christ in God's economy. For this reason we parents
    must have a clear vision of God's economy, particularly as it relates to our organic
    joining to the Lord. The Bible tells us that our bodies are members of Christ (1 Cor.
    6:15). It is crucial that our children have this vision infused into them from a very
    young age.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">&quot;But the body is not for fornication but for the Lord,
    and the Lord for the body&quot; (1 Cor. 6:13b). This is an astounding statement. Our
    bodies are for the Lord! Dating does not prepare our young people for marriage. Rather, it
    trains them how to have fun without commitment. Then they learn how to break up after the
    &quot;fun&quot; is over. Dating promotes sexual looseness without the least thought of
    personal responsibility for one's actions. In other words, it promotes fornication.
    Yet, our goal is not merely to restrain our children from dating or even from fornication.
    Our goal is that they be captured for the Lord's great purpose for humanity&#151;the
    union and mingling of divinity with humanity in a universal divine-human incorporation. To
    produce such a result, we must infuse them with a clear vision of God's economy.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The Bible says, &quot;For this is
    the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from fornication&quot;&#151;1
    Thess. 4:3. We might have expected sanctification to be contrasted with worldliness or
    perhaps with ungodliness. But here the Bible contrasts the practice of fornication to our
    sanctification. The explanation for this emphasis is found in First Corinthians 6:
    &quot;Flee fornication&quot; (v. 18); &quot;&#133;you have been bought with a price. So
    then glorify God in your body&quot; (v. 20). Our children need to realize that, in
    God's economy, our bodies are members of Christ; we must maintain a strict control
    over our body (1 Cor. 9:27). This is not a doctrine for our mental appreciation. It is a
    divine fact for our experience. Lord, grant us this precious, controlling vision!<br><br></font>

        <td align="center" width="100%" bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>A Controlling Vision:
        Our Bodies Being Members Of Christ</b></font></td>

    </table>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In First Corinthians chapter six, verses 15, 17, and 19
    there are three crucial matters: first, that our bodies are members of Christ; second,
    that we are one spirit with the Lord; and third, that our body is a temple of the Holy
    Spirit&#133;.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>MEMBERS OF CHRIST</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Verse 15 says, &quot;Do you not know that your bodies are
    members of Christ?&quot; Because we are organically united with Christ (v. 17), and
    because Christ dwells in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) and makes His home in our heart (Eph.
    3:17), our entire being, including our purified body, becomes a member of Him. Hence, to
    practice such membership we need to offer our body to Him (Rom. 12:1, 4-5).</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top">
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>ONE SPIRIT
    WITH THE LORD</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In verse 17 Paul says, &quot;But he who is joined to the
    Lord is one spirit.&quot; The word joined in this verse refers to the believers' organic
    union with the Lord through believing into Him (John 3:15-16). This union is illustrated
    by that of the branches with the vine (John 15:4-5). It is a matter not only of life, but
    also in life, the divine life. Such a union with the resurrected Lord can only be in our
    spirit.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The expression &quot;one spirit&quot; indicates the
    mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our spirit. Our spirit has been regenerated by the
    Spirit of God (John 3:6), who is now in us (1 Cor. 6:19) and is one with our spirit (Rom.
    8:16). This is the realization of the Lord who became the life-giving Spirit through
    resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17), and who is now with our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22).
    This mingled spirit is often referred to in Paul's Epistles, as in Romans 8:4-6.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>A TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In verse 19 Paul says, &quot;Or do you not know that your
    body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, Who is in you, Whom you have from God, and you are
    not your own?&quot; The Holy Spirit is in our spirit (Rom. 8:16), and our spirit is within
    our body. Hence, our body becomes a temple, a dwelling place, of the Holy Spirit.</font></p>
