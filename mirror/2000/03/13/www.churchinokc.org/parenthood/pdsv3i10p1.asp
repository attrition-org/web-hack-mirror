    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Our burden in publishing Parenthood is not to provide
    another type of family psychology or even to give advice on how to raise our children.
    Parenting is a divine stewardship. God has placed our children with us and given us a
    commission to raise them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Watchman Nee wrote:
    &quot;We have to realize how serious this responsibility is. God has placed a person'ss
    body, soul, and spirit, even his whole life and future, into our hands. No individual
    influences another individual'ss future as much as parents. No one controls a person'ss
    future as much as parents. Parents almost have a say in whether their children will go to
    hell or to heaven&quot; (<i>Messages For Building Up New Believers</i>, Vol. 2, p. 520,
    published by Living Stream Ministry.)</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In the light of the Lord'ss commission, we are desperate to
    turn our children to the Lord for their entire life. We aspire that the children of the
    saints in the Lord'ss Recovery will be like Timothy who &quot;from a babe&quot; had known
    the sacred writings, which were able to make him wise unto salvation through the faith
    which is in Christ Jesus (2 Tim. 3:15). Although we all delight to have children who are
    obedient, polite, truthful, excellent students, and diligent workers, all of this is vain
    if they do not love the Lord and seek after Him. We are believers! Our lives have been
    given absolutely to the Lord for His eternal purpose. Anything less for our children will
    never be acceptable to us. Therefore, we must experience God in us. What we print in this
    small periodical is strictly directed toward His working in us to achieve the goal and
    purpose of the Lord in our family life.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In this issue we apply to the
    care of our children some of Witness Lee'ss fellowship to the elders concerning authority
    in the churches. From their infancy, children need to meet and know authority. Authority
    in it highest definition is God Himself. Every parent represents God as His delegated
    authority. But how can we properly be an authority? Witness Lee responds with three
    crucial items: by being persons who live in love, in spirit, and in resurrection. We pray
    that we all may live to the Lord to be such persons for our children.</font><br><br>

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Down through the years, the matter of authority has caused
    me to realize that there is God and there is a sovereign One in the universe. If what we
    are serving is merely a name or some doctrinal terms, there will not be the reality of
    authority among us. But because the God whom we serve is real and living, the matter of
    authority is here among us&#133;.For this reason, democracy cannot be applied to the
    church. Moreover, neither can autocracy be applied, for autocracy centers around a single
    individual. With the church, it not a question of many or one. With the church, it is a
    question of God'ss presence and its representation. If this representation is with two or
    three, then it is a matter of these two or three. If this representation is with ten
    persons, then it is a matter of these ten persons. If this representation is with one
    individual, then it is a matter of this individual. The representation of God'ss presence
    is God'ss authority in that place. One cannot oppose this; he has to submit himself to
    this. For this reason, [we] have to learn to be those who submit to authority.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In the church not only is there
    the question of submission to authority, but there is also the question of being the
    authority. To submit to authority means that others have the authority and you submit to
    it. To be an authority means that authority is with you and you should act as the
    authority&#133;.On the one hand, there is the submission to authority, and on the other
    hand there is the exercise of authority. (W. Lee, <i>The Elders's Management of the Church</i>,
    pp. 80-81)</font><p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">&#133;Strictly speaking, the exercise of
    authority is part of the work of being the authority. If an elder knows how to be an
    authority, surely he will know how to exercise authority. For this reason, in this [issue]
    we will deal specifically with the question of being an authority. To know authority is
    for the purpose of being an authority.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>I. IN LOVE</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Ephesians 5 mentions the matter of the husband as the
    authority. There it points out specifically that the husband is an authority. The way this
    matter is presented is quite unusual. It says that the wives have to submit to their
    husbands. We know that the other side of submission is domination, yet God never charges
    the husbands to dominate over their wives. He only charges them to love their wives. The
    husband is an authority; he is the head. But how should the husband behave as the head?
    How should he behave as the authority? Ephesians 5 clearly tells us that the way is in
    love.</font></p>
