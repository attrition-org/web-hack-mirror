    Maintaining Our Marriage</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In this issue of Parenthood, we conclude the series of
    articles dealing with the impact of the marriage relationship upon child rearing. Here we
    are touching on the maintenance of our marriage ties by living in and with Christ as our
    life versus conflicts in our relationships which may culminate in separation and divorce.
    We prefer not to handle negative topics in our considerations of family living and the
    raising of children, but we cannot avoid dealing with the real problems that confront many
    couples (even we who are in the church life) in today's culture.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The initial excerpt from Witness Lee's Life-Study of
    Matthew points out our need to overcome our temper and our lusts. Because we are fallen
    human beings, not wood or stone, we have the problem of temper and lust. We need a sober
    attitude concerning the potential we have of becoming victims of the indwelling sin in our
    fallen being. We are exhorted to flee our temper and flee our lust. But how can we flee
    what is intrinsic in our flesh? &quot;Here is our salvation, our rescue, our holiness. Day
    and night we must stay with the Lord Jesus in our spirit, looking to Him, contacting Him
    and trusting in Him.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The second excerpt deals directly with the issue of
    divorce. In the Bible, especially in the direct speaking of the Lord Jesus in Matthew,
    there must by no divorce except in the case of fornication. This is according to the
    original design for marriage which was ordained by God Himself, establishing that there is
    only one husband for one wife. Anything else is adultery.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">But, as we see in the third
    excerpt, &quot;Based upon <i>God's</i> new covenant (Heb. 8:10-12), we are forgiven
    by God, who even forgets our failures. God is then able to dispense Himself into our
    intrinsic being to be our life, to be the law of life, and to be everything to us as our
    inward content that we may live Him.&quot; Realizing that they are genuine sons of God,
    the husband and wife &quot;will respect each other to the uttermost.&quot;</font><p><font
    FACE="Arial" size="2">Finally, in the excerpt from the Life-Study of the Minor Prophets
    concerning Malachi, we see why God views divorce as treachery and what is the purpose of
    God's making us one in marriage: &quot;to produce &#145;the seed of God,' that
    is, godly children.&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Our temper and our lust constantly damage and trouble us.
    If we were stone, we would not be bothered by these two things. No matter how much you
    irritate, insult, or offend a stone, it will never react, because it does not have any
    temper. Furthermore, a stone has no lust. Thus, it can never be tempted by lust. But daily
    we are either troubled by our temper or tempted by our lust. How easy it is for us to be
    irritated and offended! Some of us may be offended at least ten times a day. You may be
    offended by your husband or wife, by your children, by your neighbors, or by your
    in-laws&#133;. Others are troubled with lust. For this reason, I pointed out in one of the
    life-study messages on Genesis that you should never be alone with a member of the
    opposite sex for any length of time. If you are, you will be tempted by your ferocious
    lusts.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In order to live up to a moral
    standard higher than that of the old law, you must overcome your temper and your lusts.
    You may say that this is not easy to do. Right, it is not easy. This is why you need
    Christ. This is why you need another life. How we need to stay with Christ! We must
    contact Him not only day by day, but even hour by hour. Because of the temper and lust
    within us, we need to remain in constant fellowship with Him. You must recognize that you
    are neither wood nor stone. If you were wood or stone, you would not be concerned about
    the matter of anger and lust. But because you are a living being, you have these two
    things within you. Do you not have both temper and lust within? At any time we may be
    stumbled by our temper or tempted by our lust. Be on the alert! Be watchful and pray
    regarding these two &quot;demons,&quot; our temper and our lust. After we have been saved
    according to the principle of faith, we need to live a higher life, a life with the
    highest standard. This life with the highest standard is a life that overcomes our temper
    and our lust.</font>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>FLEEING OUR TEMPER AND LUST</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Our age is an age of fornication and adultery. Every
    country is filled with immorality. Concerning this matter, so many have been drugged by
    &quot;garlic&quot; and have lost their sense concerning this sin. May this word sober us!
    We must stay away from today's trend. Nothing insults God more than fornication, which
    damages the man created by God in His image. We all must flee our temper and our lust.
    Flee your temper! Flee your lust! </font></p>
