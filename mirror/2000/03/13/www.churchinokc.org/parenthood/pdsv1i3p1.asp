    <td width="30%" valign="top"><center><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>NURTURE THEM IN THE LORD</b></font></center>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When we, the parents in the Lord&#146;s Recovery, consider our
    responsibility of raising our children, we must always keep a sharp awareness of the
    charge that we are to &quot;nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the
    Lord&quot; (Eph. 6:4). We must not rely on the latest trends in the world of pop
    psychology to determine how our children should be trained, disciplined, or given their
    rights as human beings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Bible is our standard which governs how we care for the
    children whom God has committed into our hands. Therefore, we ourselves must first be
    those who are faithful to read and pray over the Word of God. We also need to learn how to
    lead our children into an appreciation of their heritage in the Lord by reviewing with
    them their history as it is found in the Word and in the church, that they may come to
    know not only the acts of the Lord but also His ways (Psalm 103:7).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In this issue of Parenthood we have included two portions
    from the ministry of brother Witness Lee. The first article, taken from Life Messages
    number two, focuses on the need to have a daily private time with the Lord to be
    enlightened and to be filled with the Lord. Without such a practice of daily contact with
    the Lord, we are not qualified to be parents in the highest sense. In order to lead our
    children to become useful vessels for the Lord&#146;s Recovery, we must be vital,
    functioning members of Christ&#146;s Body, that is, we must have the growth in life which
    is the result of a personal as well as corporate contact with the Lord every day.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font face="Arial" size="2">The second article picks up the
    theme in Deuteronomy of the value of reviewing our past experiences in the Lord. This is
    from the third message of the Life Study of Deuteronomy. We have also included an excerpt
    from this same message stressing the need for us to inhale the Bible as the very breath of
    God.</font><hr width="84%" size="1">
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>THE NEED FOR A PRIVATE TIME OF PRAYER</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Because the building is the growth in life, it is important
    that we know how to grow in life. In this message I have the burden to share about this
    matter in a very practical way. Throughout the years, we have greatly emphasized, perhaps
    over emphasized, the corporate aspect of the Christian life. We have laid great stress
    upon coming together to meet, to pray, and to read the Word. However, I am concerned that
    many, especially the young people in corporate living situations, do not have a private
    time of prayer. They have only the corporate prayer. I admit that no private time of
    prayer can replace the corporate time. The blessing, help, and life we receive in the
    meetings cannot be found elsewhere. Nevertheless, we need to remember that in the things
    pertaining to life there are always two aspects. In the Christian life there is the
    individual side and the corporate side, and neither can replace the other. We must have
    both. Furthermore, these two sides should be evenly balanced.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font face="Arial" size="2">Among us there is a shortage in
    the matter of having a private time to contact the Lord. Many simply do not have a private
    prayer life. Most of the brothers and sisters who are over forty five or fifty do have
    such a private prayer life. But most of the younger brothers and sisters, especially those
    in corporate living, do not. I am very concerned about this, for it is a matter that
    affects their growth in life. If you do not go to the Lord directly and privately by
    yourself, your dealing with the Lord will not be very practical or detailed.</font> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ephesians, a book that presents such a high vision concerning the
    church, also encourages us to pray. In chapter one Paul gives us the vision concerning
    God's well speaking that produces the church. But there must be the prayer to follow this
    vision. Hence, Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Without
    prayer, the vision is not adequate. Many of us have seen the vision of God's purpose
    concerning the church. But we also need to pray, both corporately and individually.</font></p>

    </center></div><p><font face="Arial" size="2">We all need to have a private time with the
    Lord. This needs to be built up into a daily habit. The best time for such a private time
    with the Lord is in the morning. Some who leave for work very early, however, may need to
    choose another time of the day. Nevertheless, we all need to set aside time for the Lord
    daily, preferably at least thirty minutes.</font></p>
