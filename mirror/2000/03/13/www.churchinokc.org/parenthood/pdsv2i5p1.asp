<center><font FACE="Arial" size="4"><b>Prayer and Modesty&#151;Two
    Crucial Virtues In A Proper Family Life</b></font></center>
<p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">To
    fulfill the responsibility of raising up children in the nurture and admonition of the
    Lord, we must live out a life that provides both an example and an atmosphere of proper
    human living. Among the many human virtues needed to live out a proper family life, the
    apostle Paul in his letter to his young disciple, Timothy, emphasized prayer with holy
    hands for the brothers and modesty with sobriety for the sisters.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The life of prayer for the brothers is expressed in a
    single verse (1&nbsp;Timothy 2:8), but it is filled with modifying instruction. Prayer
    must be &quot;in every place,&quot; indicating that we must be restricted in our walk and
    living to those places which are conducive to prayer. We are also encouraged to have a
    prayer life which is characterized by the &quot;lifting up of holy hands.&quot; Lifting up
    holy hands indicates that we must have a living which is sanctified by and separated to
    God from all things that are damaging to our ability to maintain a life of prayer. Finally
    we are told that such a prayerful living must also be &quot;without wrath and
    reasoning.&quot; From this brief verse, abounding with vital teaching concerning a proper
    living in the Lord, we the brothers are able to gain several pungent points to establish
    and carry out an effective family life through prayer.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In verses 9-15, Paul words to the
    sisters begin with the word, &quot;similarly,&quot; which suggests that Paul first
    encourages the sisters to keep a life of consistent prayer as the base for their functions
    as wives and mothers. Prayer must be the firm foundation. Then he continued to deal in
    depth with the need for the sisters to remain under the covering of sobriety and modesty.
    Brother Lee writes that the seven verses applied to the sisters testify that the sisters
    &quot;bear a sevenfold burden, a sevenfold responsibility.&quot; The role of the wives and
    mothers has much more impact on the proper family life than that of the husbands and
    fathers. But both need to pray and both need to be restricted to live a life wholly to the
    Lord before their children.</font>
<p align="center"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><b>THE NORMAL LIFE OF THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE CHURCH</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">In this message we shall consider from [First Timothy]
    2:8-15 the normal life of the brothers and sisters in the church. After Paul charges
    Timothy to take the lead to have a prayerful life, he goes on to speak of this matter. In
    2:8-15 Paul devotes one verse (v. 8) to the brothers and seven verses to the sisters (vv.
    9-15). This indicates that if we are to have a proper church life, the sisters must bear a
    sevenfold burden, a sevenfold responsibility.</font></p></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font face="Arial"><b>I. THE BROTHERS</b></font>
<p><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>A. Praying in Every Place</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Concerning the brothers, Paul says in verse 8, &quot;I will
    therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and
    reasoning.&quot; In a local church the leading ones must have a prayer life, as they were
    charged in verses 1 and 2, to set an example of prayer for all the members to follow by
    praying always in every place. In Ephesians 6 Paul tells us to pray at every time, but
    here he says to pray in every place. Although it is possible for us to pray at every time,
    morning, afternoon, evening, and night, it may not be possible for us to pray in every
    place. The requirement to pray in every place is more demanding than that to pray at every
    time. If we can pray in every place, we can surely pray at every time. But even if we are
    able to pray at every time, it still may not be possible for us to pray in every place.
    For example, it is not possible to pray in certain worldly places. Since you cannot pray
    in those places, you should not go there. If you can pray in a particular place, it is
    permissible for you to be there. But if you cannot pray in a certain place, you should not
    be there. According to verse 8, the brothers must bear the unique burden to pray in every
    place. Pray at work, at home, and in your car. As men, we should be those who pray....</font></p>
