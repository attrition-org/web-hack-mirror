    Versus The Method</b></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Many parents are desperately seeking professional counsel
    concerning the most successful techniques for dealing with their children. Christian
    parents often pray earnestly that the Lord would give them a clear way to guide their
    children through all the precarious avenues of a world dominated by destructive
    influences. It would seem that if the Lord would only show us some key methods for raising
    our children, we could become successful parents. Such procedures might qualify us to pass
    along excellent advice to others. The Lord, however, is not interested in producing <i>methods</i>;
    rather, He is producing <i>persons</i> who live as a person of God in all of our practical
    human living, including the raising of our children.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">The content of this issue of Parenthood contains excerpts
    from chapter two of <i>The Elders' Management of the Church</i>, by Witness Lee.
    Commenting on the nature of the church, brother Lee declares that the church is not a
    society, but a family. Then he points out that the head of a household cannot be crafty or
    play politics; rather, he says, &quot;The head of the household manages the family by his
    person.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">A number of examples of what is meant by the person versus
    the method are given. First, there is the problem of the heart. We must have a broad heart
    in the care of our family. We cannot try to be broad in our heart; our person must be
    broad in heart. Not only do we need to be broad in our heart, but we must also be a person
    who reads the Bible and prays every day, not as a method, but because we are intrinsically
    a reading person and a praying person. Another example is being a person who is genuinely
    honest in our words&#151;not a pretentious person. Other issues cited are problems of
    false politeness, restriction of our temper as a method rather than as a matter of our
    person, diligence, and unpretentious in our daily living.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">We can become such genuine
    persons only by learning &quot;to be enlightened, to submit to the Lord's hand, and to
    receive His dealings.&quot; Eventually, we must be broken. The lesson we must learn is
    &quot;not methods, ways, skills, or tactfulness. The lesson&#133;is brokenness before
    God.&quot; </font><br><br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" width="100%">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%" align="center"><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>The Person Versus<br>
        The Method</b></font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">We all know that to do anything, first there
    is the need of a person to do it. Next comes the method. The Chinese say that the kind of
    thing accomplished depends on the kind of person carrying it out. The method may be the
    same. But for you to do it, it will succeed. For me to do it, it may fail. For you, there
    may be a good result. For me, the result may not be very good&#133;.Hence, the foremost
    question is the person; the methods are secondary. Without the administrating person, the
    method amounts to zero. Only when there is the administrating person, plus the methods,
    will the result be beneficial. The person is the basis.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">I would seriously warn the brothers that&#133;it is
    dangerous to use any method when the person is not right. What are methods? To put it in
    terms that are not so nice, methods are crafts. To be crafty is to be political. To
    administrate a church, you cannot be political. The work of all those who manage the
    church in a political way will result in vanity. The worldly politicians can play
    politics, but the elders in the church cannot play politics. The, church is not a society;
    the church is a family. In a family, the head of the household cannot be crafty or play
    politics. The head of the household manages the family by his person. it is the person
    that manages the family, not a method that does it. In the same way, the church is the
    house of God. There is no need for a good method of administration; rather, there is the
    need of a good person for administration.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Take the problem
    of the heart as an example. The biggest need&#133;is to have a broad heart. Concerning
    this point, perhaps I will speak more in the next chapter. Of course, there are many other
    aspects to [one's] heart, but the most indispensable thing is a broad heart&#133;.Perhaps
    you would ask, what do I do if my heart is narrow by birth? You should then go home and
    pray. The Lord will change your heart&#133;.</font>
<p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">Please
    remember, however, that a broad heart is not a matter of a method, but a matter of the
    person. If [anyone] realizes his own problem, and he humbles himself and confesses that
    his heart is indeed narrow, and that from now on he would try to be broad, brothers and
    sisters, this is but a method. If your heart is narrow, it will not work for you to try to
    be broad.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">I do not know if you are able to tell the difference.
    Some&#133;have a broad heart because the person is broad. Others seem to have a broad
    heart only because they are broad in method. Actually their hearts are narrow, but in
    order to meet a certain practical need, they take a method that is broad. I would like to
    point out to the brothers and sisters that eventually this broadness becomes their
    maneuvering.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">&#133;You cannot be satisfied just by changing the method.
    Of course, we do not mean that the methods need not be changed. What we mean is that it is
    not enough merely to change the method; rather the person has to change. If you are a
    narrow-minded person, but you try to be [someone] with broad ways, surely the result will
    be a failure. You cannot deal only with the method without taking care of the person.</font></p>
