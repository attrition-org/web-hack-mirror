    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Parenting is a long-term sowing process. Whatever we do in
    our words and our actions and whatever we are in our person is a sowing which will produce
    a harvest. We must learn to be sober and thoughtful in all of the actions of our daily
    living. Paul admonished us to &quot;let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all
    wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
    singing with grace in your hearts to God. And whatever you do in word or in deed, do all
    things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through
    Him&quot;&#151;Colossians 3:16-17. If we embrace Paul's counsel, we will sow to the
    Spirit, and we will reap a harvest of the Spirit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Peter also was concerned about the human living of those
    under his care. In his first epistle, he urges them to gird up the loins of their minds
    and being sober, set their hope perfectly on the grace being brought to them at the
    revelation of Jesus Christ. They should conduct themselves as children of obedience, and
    not be fashioned according to the former lusts in their ignorance; &quot;But according to
    the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also be holy in all your manner of life.&quot;
    In everything they should remember that they were redeemed &quot;with precious blood, as
    of a Lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ&quot; from their vain
    manner of life that was handed down from their fathers&#151;1 Pet. 1:13-19.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><font face="Arial" size="2">The care and training of our
    children is primarily a matter of sowing. Especially in our speaking, we need to have the
    consciousness that we are sowing into our children seeds that will produce a harvest.
    Every loose or idle word will produce a harvest of vanity. Every disdainful or proud
    utterance will result in a multitude of egotistical, disrespectful babble from our
    children. Conversely, every word proceeding out of our mouth that is a word of grace
    seasoned with salt (Col. 4:6) and that gives grace to the hearer (Eph. 4:29) will not
    corrupt others, but will build them up. Then our speaking will afford a rich harvest of
    grace in those who hear and will result in children who are &quot;blessed after
    us&quot;&#151;Proverbs 20:6.</font><br><br>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The book of Galatians is focused on Christ replacing the
    law. It is not God's intention to keep His people under the law. His intention is to
    dispense Christ into them. Thus, Christ as the center of God's economy must replace the
    law. Because the Judaizers were misusing the law, the Epistle to the Galatians was written
    to reveal Christ as the replacement of the law. Yes, the law was given for a specific
    purpose, but God did not intend for the law to be permanent. Christ has come to replace
    the law with Himself. This is the focal point of Galatians.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In chapter one Paul shows that God is pleased to reveal His
    Son, Jesus Christ, in us (1:15-16). In chapter two we see that we should live this Christ,
    not the law (2:19-21). God does not want us to be occupied with keeping the law and be
    distracted from living Christ. According to the pleasure of His heart, He has revealed His
    Son in us that we may live Him. The crucial points in chapters one and two are that the
    Son of God has been revealed into us and that we should live Him.</font></td>
    <td width="30%" valign="top"><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>THE CONTRAST
    BETWEEN FLESH AND SPIRIT</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In chapters three and four Paul shows us how to experience
    this Christ and enjoy Him. The One revealed as the center of God's economy is Christ. But
    in our experience this One is the Spirit. This is the reason that, beginning in chapter
    three, Paul speaks of the Spirit again and again. In 3:2 he asks the Galatians if they
    received the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith. Then, in a somewhat
    rebuking tone, he goes on to ask in the next verse, &quot;Having begun by the Spirit, are
    you now being perfected by the flesh?&quot; Here we see the contrast between the Spirit
    and the flesh. This is somewhat different from 2:20, where the contrast is between Christ
    and &quot;I.&quot; The Spirit in chapter three is the very realization of the Christ in
    chapter two, and the flesh is the experiential aspect of the &quot;I.&quot; Doctrinally we
    may say that our problem is with the &quot;I,&quot; the self, but in experience our
    problem is with the flesh, which is the totality of our fallen being. It may be easy for
    us to testify in the church meetings that we are nothing but flesh. But in our daily life
    it is not so easy to admit that we are flesh. In the sight of God, fallen man is nothing
    but flesh. Beginning in chapter three and continuing into chapter six, Paul contrasts the
    Spirit with the flesh.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Galatians 4:29 says, &quot;But as then he that was born
    according to flesh persecuted him that was born according to Spirit, so also it is
    now.&quot; In this verse we see two categories of people: those born according to flesh
    and those born according to Spirit. As saved ones, we are in both categories. On the one
    hand, we are children born according to flesh; on the other hand, we are also children
    born according to Spirit. Within us we have two elements, two natures&#151;the Spirit and
    the flesh. These two elements make us two kinds of children.</font></p>
