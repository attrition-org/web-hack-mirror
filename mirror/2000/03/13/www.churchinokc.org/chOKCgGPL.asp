    <td valign="top"><p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#000099" size="4"><b>Our
    Gospel Work</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099">After the Lord Jesus Christ accomplished His
    judicial redemption and initiated His organic salvation through His death on the cross and
    His resurrection, He charged His disciples (including we who have believed into Him) to
    preach the gospel. (Matthew 28:19, Mark 16:15) This is a solemn charge to every believer.<br>
    <br>
    The early Christians took this charge seriously, as Acts 5:42 says that &quot;...they did
    not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ.&quot; The Apostle
    Paul did also: &quot;To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to
    announce to the nations the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel&quot; (Ephesians
    3:8).<br>
    <br>
    The gospel that we preach is that by the vicarious death of Jesus Christ on the cross He
    has cleansed all those who come to Him through faith from every sin, and has fulfilled all
    the requirements of God's righteousness. Through His resurrection Jesus Christ became the
    life-giving Spirit to impart the eternal, divine life of God into everyone who believes
    into Him, thus making us God's sons, both in life and nature.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099">We invite you to read the following gospel tracts,
    which we use in the Oklahoma City metro area to spread the good news of Jesus Christ.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="chOKCgMHL.asp"><i><b>The Mystery of Human Life</b></i></a><br>
    Have you ever wondered why your are living in this world and what the purpose of your life
    is? There are five keys that unlock this mystery.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="chOKCgWF.asp"><i><b>When the Wine Runs Out</b></i></a>&nbsp; <br>
    Nothing on earth is a more joyful occasion than a wedding. Everyone celebrates and no one
    is unhappy--it is the beginning of a new life, it is the continuation of human existence.
    And so it was at the wedding in Cana of Galilee to which Jesus of Nazareth was invited.
    They were enjoying the wine; the future looked bright; everyone was excited and full of
    joy. It seemed as though it would never end, when all of a sudden--the wine ran out! (John
    2:1-3) This gospel tract points out the spiritual significance of all that happened at
    that wedding feast.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="chOKCgBP.asp"><i><b>Blaise Pascal</b></i></a><br>
    Pascal was one of the keenest intellects of the 17th century and also was a fervent
    believer in Jesus Christ. Pascal's writings on this subject are not theoretical and
    abstract, but experiential and concrete. They spring from his own intimate knowledge of
    God and the joy and peace that He is. This gospel tract preaches the Good News from a most
    thoughtful prespective.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="chOKCgSF.asp"><b>Science and Faith</b></a>&nbsp; <br>
    Science and faith are usually viewed as incompatible. For centuries science has been on
    the ascendancy, seemingly faith has been on the retreat. As the boundaries of man's
    knowledge have extended, there has been less reliance upon God to explain the unknown. Yet
    surprisingly, recent scientific discoveries actually point to the existence of a Creator.</font></td>
