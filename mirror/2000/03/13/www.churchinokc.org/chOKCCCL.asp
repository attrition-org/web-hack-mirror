    <td valign="top"><p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#000099" size="4"><b>Concerning the
    Christian Life...</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>REGENERATION:</b> The Christian life begins with
    regeneration. To be regenerated is to be born of the Spirit in our spirit (John 3:6)
    through the redemption of Christ and thereby to have the life and nature of God imparted
    into our spirit. This makes our spirit alive with the very life of God.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>SEPARATION:</b> The true Christian life requires
    a proper separation from this corrupt and evil world. This separation is not according to
    legalistic, man-made rules; it is according to the life and nature of the holy One who
    dwells within us. We are separated unto God by the redeeming blood of Christ, by the Holy
    Spirit, and in the name of the Lord Jesus. In order to live a proper Christian life; we
    must maintain such a separated position. Although we are not of the world, we nevertheless
    live a godly life in the world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>CONSECRATION:</b> The Christian life is a life of
    consecration. To be consecrated to the Lord, means that we are utterly given to the Lord,
    not do something for Him nor to become something, but to make ourselves available to Him
    as a living sacrifice so that He may work on us and in us according to His good pleasure.
    We consecrate to the Lord because we love him and delight to belong to Him. We also
    recognize that we already belong to Him because He has purchased us with His precious
    blood. We in the local churches are living not for ourselves, but for God and for the
    fulfillment of His eternal purpose.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>LOVING THE LORD:</b> In our Christian life we
    emphasize loving the Lord. Above all else, God desires that we love Him. We testify that
    our Lord Jesus Christ is the altogether lovely One, that He has won our hearts, and that
    we love Him, not with a love of our own, but with the very love with which He first loved
    us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>THE WORD OF GOD:</b> The Bible occupies a very
    important place in our Christian life. All those in the local churches are encouraged to
    read the Word in a regular way even to read it through once a year. We read the Word, we
    study the Word, and we take the Word by prayer as spiritual food. All teachings,
    inspirations, and guidance, which claim the Holy Spirit as their source, must be checked
    by God's revelation in His Word. Although the Bible reveals the mind of God concerning so
    many matters, to us the Bible is not primarily a book of doctrine; instead, it is mainly a
    book of life. We come to the Word not merely for knowledge, but through a prayerful
    reading of the Scripture, to contact the Lord Jesus, who is Himself the living Word.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>PRAYER:</b> The Christian life is also a life of
    prayer. In prayer we enjoy sweet, intimate personal communion with the Lord. By prayer we
    declare our dependence on God, our submission to Him, and our desire to cooperate with Him
    in the fulfillment of His purpose. All those in the local churches are encouraged to have
    a time of personal prayer every day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST:</b> We have seen from
    God's revelation in the Bible that the Christian life is actually Christ Himself living in
    us. For this reason, we lay great emphasis on the experience of Christ. According to the
    new Testament Epistles, Christ is revealed in us, is living in us, is being formed in us,
    is making His home in us, is being magnified in us, and is becoming all in all to us.
    Instead of imitating Christ according to an outward pattern, we seek to live out Christ
    and to live by Christ by allowing the indwelling Christ to occupy our whole inward being
    and to express Himself through us in our daily living.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>A CRUCIFIED LIFE:</b> As genuine Christians, we
    are to live a crucified life. We are not ashamed of the cross of Christ, and we do not
    shrink back from following the Lord along the narrow pathway of the cross. If we would
    truly experience Christ and live by Him, we need to experience daily the subjective work
    of the cross in our lives. We have seen something of the ugliness of man's fallen flesh in
    the eyes of God, and we agree with God's judgment upon it. Moreover, we have seen that
    both the self and the natural man are opposed to God. Therefore, we welcome the inward
    working of the death of Christ so that we may experience Christ and live by Him in the
    riches of His resurrection life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>NOURISHMENT:</b> If we would live a normal
    Christian life, we need to be nourished daily with spiritual food and spiritual drink. For
    this reason, we emphasize the partaking of Christ as our spiritual food and drink. In the
    Spirit and through the Word, we enjoy Him as our life supply. As He Himself said, &quot;He
    that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me&quot; (John 6:57). The Lord is the living bread,
    the bread of life, and the bread of God who came down from heaven to give life to the word
    (John 6:33, 35, 51), and we are nourished by Him day by day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>THE GROWTH IN LIFE:</b> In the local churches we
    emphasize the fact that in the Christian life we should grow normally in life. We are not
    content to remain spiritual infants. The divine life, like the human life, must have a
    normal development leading to maturity. Therefore, as seekers of the Lord, we pursue the
    growth in life. We desire to be a full-grown man to express the Lord, to represent Him
    with His authority, and to engage in spiritual warfare to defeat His enemy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>HUMAN LIVING:</b> As Christians, we also live a
    normal human life, free from extremes and balanced in every way. We desire that our entire
    being, spirit, soul, and body be maintained for the glory of God. We seek to express the
    humanity of Jesus in all our relationships and bear a worthy testimony of Him in all walks
    of human life: at home, at school, in our neighborhoods, and at our places of employment.
    To us, the Christian life cannot be divorced from our daily human life. We find that the
    more we grow in Christ, the more truly human we become, and the more we enjoy in a
    practical way the uplifted, transformed humanity of Jesus.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>THE SPIRIT:</b> The Christian life is a life of
    walking according to the Spirit. To walk in the sprit is to have our living and our being
    according to the Spirit. Therefore, we need to set our mind on the Spirit and put to death
    the practices of the body (Romans 8:6,13). When we walk according to the Spirit, all the
    righteous requirements of God are fulfilled in us spontaneously. Only by living in the
    Spirit and walking according to the Spirit will the divine things revealed in the
    Scriptures become real to us. Hence, to be a normal Christian we must know the Spirit,
    live in the Spirit, and walk according to the Spirit. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>TRANSFORMATION:</b> Many Christians know of the
    regeneration of the spirit and the transfiguration of the body, but they neglect the
    crucial matter of the transformation of the soul. Nevertheless the Bible says, &quot;Be
    transformed by the renewing of the mind&quot; (Romans 12:2). Therefore, we recognize the
    need to be dispositionally transformed in our souls by the inward working of the Spirit of
    life. As we are transformed, an inward change takes place in our very being. As our soul
    is permeated with the element of God, it is purified and sanctified. It can thereby
    fulfill its God-created function to express the Lord who dwells in our regenerated spirit.
    This transformation of the soul is intimately related to our readiness to meet the Lord at
    His coming. Those who wold dwell in His holy and glorious presence must not merely be
    positionally sanctified, but be dispositionally transformed. This transformation requires
    the operation of the cross negatively and the working of the Spirit of life positively.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><b>TRANSFIGURATION:</b> Finally, at the culmination
    of the Christian experience in life, our body will be transfigured and made like the
    Lord's glorious body (Philippians 3:21). In the Bible this is called the redemption of the
    body, the fullness of sonship. Therefore, the Christian life begins with regeneration,
    passes through transformation, and consummates with the transfiguration of the body.</font></p>
