			<P ALIGN="CENTER">QUICK RESPONSE TIME / AUTOMATED EMPLOYEE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM</P>
			<P><IMG SRC="spacer15.gif" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">EXCLUSIVE STAFFING maintains files on
			over 2000 qualified employees. We generally can respond within 30 - 45 minutes when filling an order for a temporary.
			This prompt response time is possible as a result of a unique, custom-designed Employee Information/Retrieval program.
			This PC-based program designed especially for Exclusive Temporaries of Virginia maintains our employee data base
			in readily accessible files which may be accessed in a number of ways, including by individual employee name, number,
			skill or combination of skills. Other pertinent data is also immediately accessible such as education, employment
			history, credit history, availability and transportation. Quite often, Exclusive Temporaries can confirm the availability
			of a specific temporary during the initial telephone conversation with a customer.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER">CUSTOMIZED INVOICING</P>
			<P><IMG SRC="spacer15.gif" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">Exclusive Staffing has the capability
			to customize invoicing to include cost center, department, division or other data to assist and facilitate internal
			management reporting.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER">SERVICE GUARANTEE</P>
			<CENTER>
			<P>We guarantee all our employees. If an Exclusive employee is unsatisfactory we do not charge - period!</P>
