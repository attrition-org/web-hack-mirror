<br>I am wondering if you could give me any help in rehoming two dilute
persian calicos,
<br>sadly they do not get on with my moggy, we have tried a controlled
exposure programme
<br>through an animal behaviourist, but it has not worked.
<br>They have come through quarantine and we have had them at home now
for eight months
<br>and cannot find a suitable home for them,
<br>I do not want people who think they are going to get a free persian,
<br>and do not think about the care and attention they require.
<br>Perhaps you could email me if you can help.

<br>I am looking for a kitten or young cat (preferably under 12/18 months)
to join my loving home.
<br>Although important, looks are not a big factor in my search, but personality
is.
<br>I am looking for a cat that is affectionate, very people orientated,
playful, mischeivious and has
<br>heaps of personality. As far as looks are concerned, I have seen several
breeds
<br>i like.The Devon / Cornish Rex,Siamese,Tonkinese, Oriental and Ocicat.These
all
<br>seem to be very similar in shape and build but i am open to suggestions
on other
<br>breeds that fit the personality i am looking for.I live in Exeter,
Devon so
<br>traveling within Devon, Somerset and Cornwall is not a problem but
i am willing
<br>to travel further for the right kitty. If any one can help i would
be grateful to
<br>recieve information regarding personality, looks,availabilty,cost and
location
<br>of breeders of the mentoined cats or another breed fitting the mentioned
personality.

<br>Please can you help me. My parents have a lovely stumpy rumpy Manx
cat who has been a family cat,
<br>growing up with myself and four other children, and a dog. Unfortunately,
Nigel (the cat), is
<br>growing old, and we (the children), have all left home, so my Mother
would
<br>dearly love to buy another Manx kitten as she hates the idea of losing
Nigel and having no one to look after.
<br>Please could you let us know where to find a Manx breeder in the south
of England,
<br>or failing that, simply in the U.K.
<p>Thank you for your help.

<br>Aloha, I live in Hawaii which has a limited market in almost everything.
We
<br>were successful in getting a Scottish Fold this winter and wanted to
get a
<br>male cream or tortoise. We understand that a British Shorthair or
<br>something are best for breeding with a fold. We do not intend to become
<br>breeders but to have a least one litter. My understanding is that animals
<br>from Australia or New Zealand do not have to go through quarantine
which is
<br>why we are looking down under for breeders. Money will also dictate
if this
<br>is feasible for us. Our kitten is already six months old so we don't
mind an
<br>older kitten either. I hope this is informative enough. Thanks for
your
<br>response.

<br>In locating an adult tonkinese.&nbsp; We lost our tonkinese in December
to cancer
<br>and our moggie last August.&nbsp; Currently our house is empty.&nbsp;
We have been to
<br>rescue organisations, but always seem to miss the boat - the loveliest
ones
<br>are reserved.&nbsp; If anyone hears/knows of a young/adult tonkinese
available
<br>please will they call us - ideally 1 to 4 years old.&nbsp; We have
missed the
<br>boat on 2 occasions with tonkinese welfare/breeders for re-homing and
2
<br>other occasions were offered 2 quite elderly cats and 2 that had not
been
<br>neutered/vaccinated and had been exposed to cat flu.&nbsp; We are very
miserable
<br>at the moment and would welcome any news of a possible tonkinese that
would
<br>like to own us.
<p>Many thanks.
