<br><b>February 27th</b>
<p>I have just been contacted by a lovely lady who had a Cornish Rex kitten
from
<br>me about 3 years ago. This boy was a lovely, lovable boy until about
a year
<br>ago, when a stray tom moved into the area, and beat him up so badly
that the
<br>vet had to stitch him back together again; after this he started spraying
<br>indoors, including on kitchen work surfaces etc. The stray was captured
and
<br>taken to the RSPCA, who neutered him and rehomed him several miles
away.
<br>Within a few weeks Gizzi stopped spraying, and returned to his former
happy
<br>self - until the other cat returned to the neighbourhood, and moved
in with a
<br>someone up the road. Gizzi immediately became stressed and started
spraying
<br>again. The neighbour who has adopted the stray refuses to keep him
in, and
<br>says it's Julia's problem for having a namby-pamby pedigree cat! Julia
tells
<br>me that despite now being kept safe indoors, Gizzi spends most of his
time
<br>staring out of the window with a hunted expression on his face, and
sprays
<br>and urinates all around the house. Treatments from the vet have failed
to
<br>resolve the problem, and it has reached the stage where Julia is reluctantly
<br>having to consider rehoming him, partly because of the intractable
<br>unacceptable behaviour, and partly because he is so stressed and unhappy,
and
<br>she feels he might be happier in a new home where he will not feel
so
<br>threatened. Can anyone suggest any treatments, alternative or behavioural,
<br>which might help to de-stress him and thus control the spraying / urination
<br>problems, as he is very dearly loved and rehoming is really a last
resort if
<br>all else fails.
<p>Thanks for your help,

who will be ready to leave home at the end of March at the latest. We live
in Leicestershire but will travel."
