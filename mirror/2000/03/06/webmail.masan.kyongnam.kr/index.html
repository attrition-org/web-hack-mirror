<xmp>So long as there shall exist, by reason of law 
and custom, a social condemnation, which, in the 
face of civilization, artifically creates hells 
on earth, and complicates a destiny that is devine, 
with human fatality; so long as the three problems 
of the age - the degradation of man by poverty, the
ruin of woman by starvation, and the dwarfing of 
childhood by physical and spiritual night - are not
solved; so long as, in certain regions, social
asphyxia shall be possible; in other words, and from
a yet more extended point of view, so long as 
ignorance and misery remain on earth, defacements like this cannot be
useless.  - Hauteville House, 1862 through eternity
