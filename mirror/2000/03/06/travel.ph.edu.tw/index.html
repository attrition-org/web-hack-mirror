<xmp>So long as there shall exist, by reason of law 
and custom, a social condemnation, which, in the 
face of civilization, artifically creates hells 
on earth, and complicates a destiny that is devine, 
with human fatality; so long as the three problems 
of the age - the degradation of man by poverty, the
ruin of woman by starvation, and the dwarfing of 
childhood by physical and spiritual night - are not
solved; so long as, in certain regions, social
asphyxia shall be possible; in other words, and from
a yet more extended point of view, so long as 
ignorance and misery remain on earth, defacements like this cannot be
useless.  - Hauteville House, 1862 through eternity 

Diallo's murdered sprit will not rest till civil justice is done.

Greetz to all those who took a stand, all those
who marched with me, all those who will vote and
all those unjustfully accused and unjustfully
murdered  because of false perceptions. Greets to Taiwan, Bradley's for
you! He's the only president who will come through in the clutch.  Word to
Efnet and its corrupt ircOPS (protest them to) Greets to
inadequate/!/bin/su/sms and all those who
helped me get by hush/ sco/lame/#sesame/#*
 Last greet's to Slic Vic and Jackie, sorry guys I was outlastnight :>
