<H1>Starman_Jones 0wns j00 Again!!??</H1>Weston still sux dick. <BR><BR>A hacker 
is a person intensely interested in the arcane and recondite<BR>workings of any 
computer operating system. Most often, hackers are<BR>programmers. As such, 
hackers obtain advanced knowledge of operating<BR>systems and programming 
languages. They may know of holes within<BR>systems and the reasons for such 
holes. Hackers constantly seek<BR>further knowledge, freely share what they have 
discovered,<BR>and never, ever intentionally damage data.<BR><BR><BR><BR>A 
cracker is a person who breaks into or<BR>otherwise violates the system 
integrity of<BR>remote machines, with malicious intent. Crackers, having 
gained<BR>unauthorized access, destroy vital data, deny legitimate users 
service,<BR>or basically cause problems for their targets. Crackers can easily 
be<BR>identified because their actions are malicious.<BR><BR><BR>Pity the media 
dont know the difference. <BR><BR>SHOUTS: comlogik, seeweed, ShortChange,
