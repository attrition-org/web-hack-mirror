            <p><strong><font color="blue" face=""><font size="5"><font></font></font></font></strong>The 
            Blue Springs School District recognizes that the best learning 
            opportunity for a student is classroom interaction with the teacher 
            and other students. That makes attendance very important. When a 
            students misses school, regardless of the reason, valuable 
            experiences have been missed. Good attendance also helps students of 
            all ages learn the value of attendance and punctuality. It helps 
            students in the maturation process as they learn responsibility for 
            their actions. Good attendance affects the student's behavior, 
            attitude, learning, and overall school success. Being at school is 
            the student's job. It is the district's hope that 
            parents will support and encourage good attendance. Parents are a 
            key ingredient in this process. We encourage parents to help by 
            scheduling appointments, vacations, outings, etc. outside the school 
            day. Each school keeps students/parents informed about absences. 
            Upon the sixth absence and again on the tenth absence, the school 
            will notify the student's parents by letter.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>District Absentee Policy 
            (5.51.3)</strong></p>
            <p><strong></strong>1.&nbsp; A parent should 
            notify their student's school attendance office by phone for each 
            day of a student's absence.</p>
            <p>2.&nbsp; If the school is not notified by 
            the parent, the school will initiate contact with the parent.&nbsp; 
            Students who return to school without being excused by their parent 
            will maintain an unexcused absence until the parent provides 
            appropriate verification of the absence.</p>
            <p>3.&nbsp; Absences will be classified as 
            excused or unexcused by the school district:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Excused Absence 
            - an excused absence will include any absence due to legitimate 
            medical issues, religious observances and those absences related to 
            a student's disability.&nbsp; With any planned, excused absence, it 
            is recommended that the parents contact the school prior to the 
            planned absence and make advanced arrangements for class work.&nbsp; 
            All work missed due to an excused absence may be made up according 
            to the guidelines in the school's student handbook.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Unexcused 
            Absence - Student not excused from school by a parent may be 
            considered truant.&nbsp; Students must have parental consent to leave 
            school during the school day, and appropriately check out of school 
            through the school's attendance office.&nbsp; Students choosing not 
            to follow this procedure will be considered unexcused.&nbsp; Work 
            may not be made up due to unexcused absence.&nbsp; Parents/students 
            who violate the state compulsory attendance law will be referred to 
            the appropriate authorities.</p>
            <p>4.&nbsp; To keep parents aware of their 
            student's absences, the school will attempt to notify the parent by 
            letter when the student's absence in any class reaches 10 
            days.&nbsp; Appropriate notification to a jparent or a conference 
            may be initiated to address attendance issues.</p>
            <p>5.&nbsp; Excessive absences could result in 
            a student's loss of academic credit after the student has been 
            afforded a full due process hearing before the board of 
            education.</p>
