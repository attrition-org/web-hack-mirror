            prides itself in preparing students to be lifelong learners.&nbsp; 
            As you read through these pages you will readily see that our 
            students excel academically and physically.&nbsp; When they leave us 
            they are equally prepared for the world of higher education or the 
            world of work.&nbsp; Our students; test scores, although above the 
            state and national averages, are only one indicator of their 
            preparedness.&nbsp; The WHOLE child is educated in the Blue Springs 
            School District where students enter nurturing, safe, and well-kept 
            environments.&nbsp; It is a place where every staff member remembers 
            our purpose--to stay focused on kids.</font></font><font color="blue"></font><p><font color="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Blue Springs district is also a 
            place for opportunity.&nbsp; Students in our high schools have over 
            192 courses to choose from and a class day structured to allow 
            students to maximize this potential.&nbsp; And, for that reason, any 
            student graduating from the district has a diploma that comes with a 
            guarantee.&nbsp; If our graduates find that once they are in the 
            workplace they do not have the basic reading, writing, and math 
            skills to do the job they are welcome to come back to the district 
            to learn the missing skills--free of charge.</font></p>
        <p><font color="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will find a district that is 
            financially sound, where the bulk of our tax payers' dollars goes 
            directly to instruction.&nbsp; You will find facilities that are 
            maintained on a long-term, cost effective plan.&nbsp; You will find 
            that responsible management of tax dollars is a priority.</font></p>
        <p><font color="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the district there is the 
            opportunity for all students and staff to make the most of 
            technology.&nbsp; Thanks to excellent planning and patron support, 
            the district has a comprehensive technology plan and abundant 
            equipment for student and staff use.</font></p>
        <p><font color="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we are grateful for strong 
            patron and business support.&nbsp; Our parents and citizens know 
            they are welcome in our schools at all times.&nbsp; We welcome their 
            involvement and input.&nbsp; We feel that the strengths of our 
            district are parent and patron support coupled with that of our 
            business partners; each group eagerly shares their expertise, 
            talents, people, and resources with us.</font></p>
        <p><font color="blue" face>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are truly a solid district with 
            priorities clearly established--centered on children--in a place 
            where excellence prevails.</font></p><font color="blue"></font>
