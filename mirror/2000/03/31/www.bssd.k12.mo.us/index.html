            <p><font color="#0000ff" face="Excalibur Script" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am Dr. Charles 
            McGraw, superintendent of Blue Springs Schools.&nbsp; I would like 
            to take a few moments of your time to give you a quick tour of our 
            district.&nbsp; As you briefly visit our schools through this web 
            site and later when you walk our halls and visit with our students 
            and staff, you will find that the district's motto, Where Excellence 
            Prevails, is a standard we believe in and adhere to each day.&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font color="#0000ff" face="Excalibur Script" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only will 
            you find students ready and eager to learn, but you will also find 
            they do so in a safe and clean environment.&nbsp; We are a district 
            that prides itself in excellent people and excellent programs.&nbsp; 
            We believe we are here to focus on each child, to give that child 
            every opportunity to learn and reach his or her maximum 
            potential.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#0000ff" face="Excalibur Script" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We start by focusing 
            on our facilities with buildings that are maintained with 
            exceptional care and equipped to meet the students needs.&nbsp; 
            Because we pride ourselves in excellence, classroom equipment 
            includes a multi-million dollar package of computer technology which 
            we believe is exceedingly necessary for our students' future 
            successes.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#0000ff" face="Excalibur Script" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second focus you 
            will find as you step into our schools is a solid teaching staff 
            with a great cross-section of experience.&nbsp; We value our 
            teachers who are enjoying long careers as innovative practitioners 
            and we welcome teachers new to the profession who bring new 
            enthusiasm and ideas with them.&nbsp; You will find all levels of 
            teaching experience here and you will see sound educational practice 
            as you enter their classrooms.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#0000ff" face="Excalibur Script" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third focus you 
            will find in our schools is a sense of total community.&nbsp; We are 
            the City of Cooperation and you can find everyone from volunteer 
            parents, to retired teachers, to busy local business persons in our 
            schools on any given day.&nbsp; We value their input, welcome their 
            volunteer spirit and count on the additional depth they bring to 
            student learning.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#0000ff" face="Excalibur Script" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, you will 
            find a support staff that keeps its focus on kids.&nbsp; I encourage 
            you to visit with a secretary, food service worker or bus 
            driver.&nbsp; Again, you will find a sense of pride in being part of 
            our schools, and most importantly, a strong committment to our 
            students.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#0000ff" face="Excalibur Script" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enjoy your visit to 
            our web-site.&nbsp; On behalf of the students and staff of the Blue 
            Springs Schools, I say welcome; we are glad you are 
    here!</font></p></td></tr></table>
