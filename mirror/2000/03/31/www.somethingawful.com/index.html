It is a shame when <a href="mailto:cmeinel@techbroker.com">charlatans</a> link to our resources out of
context, only to suit their petty obsession.<br>
<br>
<br>
This mirror was moved to our hoax page shortly after taking it.
For those illiterate or intentionally blind, we posted
to the defaced mailing list early on April 1 saying we would
take mirrors of hoaxes and sort them out the next few
days. Because of <a href="http://www.happyhacker.org">ignorant hackers</a>, we had to move this mirror
out of our normal dated directory structure as she was linking directly to it saying we were 
<a href="http://www.happyhacker.org/sucks.html">"feeding a phone story"</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
Those of you linking over from <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/">Something Awful</a>, we apologize
for the interuption.
<br>
<br>
You can find the mirror of 'somethingawful.com' on our 
<a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/hoax.html">hoax page</a>.<br>
