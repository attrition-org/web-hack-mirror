 I guess this is the most dangerous file I've ever wriiten, since even<br>
if you follow all directions to the letter, you still die. In fact, that's<br>
the idea. First, let me stress this: I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT SUICIDE IS THE<br>
ANSWER TO ANYTHING. I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE NOBILITY OF SUICIDE, NOR DO I<br>
THINK IT IS EASIER TO KILL ONESELF THAN TO FACE THE PROBLEMS AND TRIALS OF<br>
LIFE. Now that that's over with, down to the nitty-gritty. How to kill your-<br>
self!
<p>
NOTE: Some info in this file has been taken without permission from the book<br>
FINAL EXIT, a complete guide to euphenasia.
<p>
1) FIREARMS<br>
 Firearms are the cause of death for more than 60% of male suicide<br>
deaths each year. They are often thought to be the most sure way of commiting<br>
suicide, and the easiest. This is also the messiest way, and the most diff-<br>
icult for family members to cope with. It may not neccisarily be the most<br>
error free form of suicide, either. If you are planning to use a firearm, be<br>
sure it is at LEAST a .38 or .357 caliber, as anything smaller may not cause<br>
death, and then you're stuck a veggie. Also, the preferred way to blow you<br>
brains out is by putting the barrel of the gun in your mouth, pointed up at<br>
the base of your brain. You could also do a Cobain and use a shotgun. That is<br>
just as effective :)
<p>
2) SLASHING WRISTS<br>
 This is actually not as painful as one might think. As long as you<br>
use a sharp blade, it can be quite effective. First, get a large pan or bowl<br>
and fill it with VERY cold water and ice cubes. LOTS of ice. Sit your fore-<br>
arm in it for about 1 hour, or until your arm is COMPLETELY numb. Now, get a<br>
sharp knife, such as a ginsu or your mom's best carving blade, if you don't<br>
have a suitable one. Otherwise use one of those razor util knives, and extend<br>
the blade to full length. Make three cuts.<br>
 a) At the transition of your wrist into your hand, right<br>
 across.<br>
 b) At a 45๘ angle starting from the left point of the first<br>
 cut. Go from upper-left to lower-right (if it's your left)<br>
 c) From close to the center of the wrist, cut straight down<br>
 your arm, as far as possible without causing yourself pain
<p>
This has the effect of severing the many arteries in your arm, with no hope<br>
of a blood clot or similar effect. You probably have about 6-10 minutes after<br>
doing this, so do it during the Simpsons or something so you can laugh for the<br>
final 10 minutes of your life.
<p>
3) CYANIDE<br>
 Cyanide is a very controverial substance. According to different acc-<br>
ounts, death by cyanide ingestion can be quick and painless (12 sec.) or long<br>
drawn out and unbearably painful (4 or 5 days of writhing pain). It is essent-<br>
ially unpredicatble, but death is almost certain in any situation. Cyanide<br>
can be obtained from peach pits, although I am unsure of the exact process<br>
right now (look for an upcoming CH HPA)<br>
 Here are directions for one form of cyanide:<br>
 1. Take a small glass of cold TAP WATER (it has the proper pH)<br>
 2. Stir 1.0 to 1.5 g KCN (potassium cyanide) into the water<br>
 3. After about 5 minutes, the KCN is dissolved and ready to drink<br>
 4. After drinking, you will lose consiuosness in about 1 minute<br>
 5. Death will follow the coma in 15 to 45 minutes.
<p>
4) INJECTION<br>
 The key to injecting anything is being able to use a seringe. I will<br>
assume you know how to do this. It is important that all substances I will<br>
describe here be injected into a VEIN, not an ARTERY. This way they will be<br>
re-distributed thru the heart when the blood reaches the heart.<br>
 A) AIR<br>
 Injection of a LARGE amount of air into the blood stream will<br>
 cause cardiac arrest in the victim. The only problem is the<br>
 amount of air that's needed. Close to 40 CC's is required.<br>
 Death is fairly painless, and reasonably fast.
<p>
 B) DISTILLED WATER<br>
 I believe this will work, although I am not positive. You<br>
 would probably have to inject the better part of a whole<br>
 bottle of water, like Evian. I don't know about the death.
<p>
 C) IODINE<br>
 This is used in China to kill newborn babies. You can use<br>
 either Iodine or Rubbing Alchohol. 20 to 40 CC's should<br>
 ensure rapid death.
<p>
 D) NICOTINE<br>
 See my file on making pure nicotine syrup, or one of the<br>
 files in the Jolly Roger Cookbook. Since a few drops ingested<br>
 will cause swift death, I would think that 2-3 CC's directly<br>
 injected should make quick work of you. Be aware that once<br>
 it is injected you will be stoned out of your mind for the<br>
 few (5-10?) minutes before death.
<p>
5) PLASTIC BAG<br>
 This is usually used as extra insurence, and should be used with any<br>
 method that involves OD'ing on anything, because this is a failproof<br>
 way to commit suicide. Take a mid sized plastic bag. Not one small<br>
 enough that you'd choke on it, cause that just sucks. Use one that<br>
 is fairly large, but not one that would take forever to fill. Maybe<br>
 a shopping bag or something. Put it on your head and take 2 rubber<br>
 bands and secure it around your neck. The effect is simple. You will<br>
 eventually (1-2 hrs) use up all the Oxygen in the bag. As you run<br>
 low, you will just get sleepy, and fall asleep, and never wake up.
<p>
Drug List:<br>
 The following table shows some of the most popular prescription drugs<br>
 and the requirments to kill yourself. All of the pills should be<br>
 taken with alchohol, as this increases the intensity of the drugs.
<p>
<br>
Generic Name Trade Name Lethal Dose #/tablets<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Flurazepam Dalamane 3g 100*30mg<br>
Chloral Hydrate Noctec 10g 20*500mg<br>
Meprobamate Miltown, Equanil 45g 112*400mg<br>
Meperidine Demerol 3.6g 72*50mg<br>
Morphine --- 200mg 14*15mg<br>
Secobarbital Seconal (sleep agent) 4.5g 45*100mg<br>
Propoxyphene Darvon (NOT DARVOCET) 2.0g 30*65mg
<p>
The best way to take these is to grind up about 3/4 of them and put them in<br>
a yogurt or pudding. Sweeten it with suger to offset the taste. First take<br>
the other 1/4 of them with a glass of wine. Then eat the yogurt with a fair<br>
amount of speed. Then wash it all down with some scotch, wiskey, or other<br>
hard liquor.
<p>
<br>
Fatal Liquids:
<p>
This mixture will work well and be fatal with extreme speed (several<br>
minutes)
<p>
Pentobarbital sodium 9g<br>
Alcohol 20ml<br>
Purified Water 15ml<br>
Propylene glycol 10ml<br>
Orange Syrup 50ml
<p>
(Secobarbital sodium can be substituted for the Pentobarbital sodium if<br>
neccesary)
