<p> I really hate to put up a second defacement.... But when there are people like w0lf out there who decide to ./hax0r a website to prove that they are n33t0 l33to piss me off.  Neutron.... do you think you are special for this shit?  what kind of pride do you get from "hacking" a wide open system?  There is no point in it whatsoever.  Okay... there is a stupid defacement, are his balls bigger for this feat? I think not.  I would like to let this be a notification to the administrator of this site to pay more attention to the vulnerabilities you leave open.  There are dumbasses with their ./scripts and their ./hacks who think they are proving something to the world.  Fuck that.  Lock down your site and never worry about this bullshit again.</p>
