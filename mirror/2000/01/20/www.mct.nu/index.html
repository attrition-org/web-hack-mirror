 Like cartman would say :: "sweet" ...

 ... and yes you got hacked | and yes, now you are probably checking your logfiles
 and yes you may find ip addresses, but - do you *really* think we were that stupid
 by using our real ip's?  I wouldn't think so.

 Mind you, rooting a few machines and going through a couple of proxies get you real
 far these days when it boils down to staying anonymous.  So, go ahead, be my guest 
 and "chase" that nasty person who hacked you :: wanna bet you wind up with an innocent 
 victim hunted down by you? :-)

 So drop that rage, and listen up instead!!

 So, you got a serious security leak by now | happy hunting.  If we might give you
 one piece of advice - don't use Microsoft products.  A complete switchover towards
 FreeBSD might be a hard thing to do, but BSD is by far the most secure operating
 system we know.  Do your users a favour, install FreeBSD today (www.freebsd.org).

 Oh, and if you really want to use NT...  Learn to configure it the right way, will
 you?  What kind of example is this to the students? :-)  Or, get that k'rad 3l33t3
 MCSE grad <yeah, like that will help you any further>


 No, this isn't a lame pr-stunt :-)


 Thanks you for your time,
