whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy<br>
Wherever a hungry new born baby cries<br>
Whereever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air<br>
Look for me ma', I'll be there<br>
Wherever somebodies stuglin' for a place to stand<br>
For a decent job or a helpin' hand<br>
Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free<br>
Look in their eyes ma,<br>
You'll see me! - tom joad<br><br>
we are the freedom fighters, born as ghosts. strike out, against the government. we have our reasons, w00w00! <br>
