    <font color="#FF0000"><h2 align="center">HCFA At a Glance</font> </h2>
    <a NAME="whatis"><p>The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is a federal agency
    within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. HCFA runs the Medicare and
    Medicaid programs &#151; two national health care programs that benefit about 75 million
    Americans. And with the Health Resources and Services Administration, HCFA runs the
    Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program, a program that is expected to cover many of the
    approximately 10 million uninsured children in the United States. </p>
    <h2>Additional Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>HCFA also regulates all laboratory testing (except research) performed on humans in the
    United States. Approximately 158,000 laboratory entities fall within HCFA&#146;s
    regulatory responsibility. And HCFA, with the Departments of Labor and Treasury, helps
    millions of Americans and small companies get and keep health insurance coverage and helps
    eliminate discrimination based on health status for people buying health insurance. </p>
    <h2>Running the Programs</h2>
    <p>HCFA spends over $360 billion a year buying health care services for beneficiaries of
    Medicare, Medicaid and the Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program. HCFA: <ul>
      <li>assures that the Medicaid, Medicare and Children&#146;s Health Insurance programs are
        properly run by its contractors and state agencies; </li>
      <li>establishes policies for paying health care providers; </li>
      <li>conducts research on the effectiveness of various methods of health care management,
        treatment, and financing; and </li>
      <li>assesses the quality of health care facilities and services and taking enforcement
        actions as appropriate. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Areas of Special Focus</h2>
    <h3>Fighting Fraud and Abuse</h3>
    <p>HCFA has a comprehensive program to combat fraud and abuse. Working with other federal
    departments and state and local governments, HCFA takes strong enforcement action against
    those who commit fraud and abuse, protects taxpayer dollars, and guarantees security for
    the Medicare, Medicaid and Child Health programs. </p>
    <h3>Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement</h3>
    <p>HCFA is improving the quality of health care provided to Medicare, Medicaid and Child
    Health Insurance Program beneficiaries. Quality improvement is based on: <ul>
      <li>developing and enforcing standards through surveillance; </li>
      <li>measuring and improving outcomes of care; </li>
      <li>educating health care providers about quality improvement opportunities; and </li>
      <li>educating beneficiaries to make good health care choices. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Agency </a><a href="leader.htm">Structure</a></h2>
    <p>Agency staff working in the Baltimore, Maryland headquarters and in 10 regional offices
    nationwide oversee HCFA programs. The headquarters staff are responsible for national
    program direction. The regional office staff provide HCFA with the local presence
    necessary for quality customer service and oversight. </p>
    <p>A brief outline of the three major HCFA programs follows: </p>
    <h2><strong>Medicare</strong></h2>
    <h3>Who Qualifies?</h3>
    <p>HCFA runs Medicare, the nation&#146;s largest health insurance program, covering over
    38 million Americans at a cost of just under $200 billion. Medicare provides health
    insurance to: <ul>
      <li>people who are at least 65 years old; </li>
      <li>people who are disabled; and </li>
      <li>people with permanent kidney failure. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What are the benefits?</h3>
    <p>Medicare has two parts: Hospital Insurance (Part A) and Medical Insurance (Part B). </p>
    <p>Medicare Part A helps pay for inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing facility
    services, home health services, and hospice care. </p>
    <p>Medicare Part B helps pay for doctor services, outpatient hospital services, medical
    equipment and supplies, and other health services and supplies. </p>
    <h3>Many Choices for Getting Benefits</h3>
    <p>Many Medicare beneficiaries choose to enroll in managed care plans like Health
    Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). They can get both Part A and Part B benefits in most
    managed care plans. In addition to the typical HMO, other options are available, including
    Preferred Provider Organizations. </p>
    <p>Beginning in 1999, Medicare beneficiaries will have more choices. New choices include
    HMOs with or without point-of-service options; provider sponsored organizations (closed
    networks operated by providers); private fee-for-service plans; and medical savings
    accounts. </p>
    <h3>Where to Apply</h3>
    <p>People who are already getting Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits are
    automatically enrolled when they become eligible for Medicare. Others must go to their <a
    href="http://s3abaca.ssa.gov/pro/fol/fol-home.html">local Social Security office</a> and
    apply. </p>
    <h2>Medicaid</h2>
    <p>Medicaid is a health insurance program for certain low-income people. It is funded and
    administered through a state-federal partnership. Although there are broad federal
    requirements for Medicaid, states have a wide degree of flexibility to design their
    program. States have authority to: <ul>
      <li>establish eligibility standards; </li>
      <li>determine what benefits and services to cover; </li>
      <li>set payment rates. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Who Qualifies?</h3>
    <p>On any given day, there are about 33 million people who are eligible for Medicaid.
    These people include: certain low-income families with children; aged, blind or disabled
    people on Supplemental Security Income; certain low-income pregnant women and children;
    and people who have very high medical bills. </p>
    <h3>What are the Benefits?</h3>
    <p>Because states have flexibility in structuring their Medicaid programs, there are
    variations from state to state. All states, however, must cover these basic services:
    inpatient and outpatient hospital services; laboratory and X-ray services, skilled nursing
    and home health services, doctors&#146; services; family planning; and periodic health
    checkups, diagnosis and treatment for children. </p>
    <h3>Where to apply?</h3>
    <p>People can generally apply for Medicaid at local welfare or social service offices.
    Many states have now made it possible to apply in other locations, such as hospitals and
    public health clinics, or in some cases by mail. </p>
    <h2>Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program</h2>
    <p>HCFA, along with the Health Resources and Services Administration, runs the
    Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program. Program benefits became available October 1,
    1997, and will provide $24 billion in federal matching funds over 5 years to help states
    expand health care coverage to as many as 5 million of the nation&#146;s uninsured
    children. </p>
    <h3>Who Qualifies?</h3>
    <p>States set eligibility and coverage, following broad federal guidelines. States also
    have flexibility in the way they provide services. Recipients in all states must have low
    incomes, be otherwise ineligible for Medicaid, and be uninsured. </p>
    <h3>What are the Benefits?</h3>
    <p>State programs differ, but all states must cover at least these services: inpatient and
    outpatient hospital services, doctors&#146; surgical and medical services, laboratory and
    X-ray services, and well baby/child care, including immunizations. Some states may provide
    additional benefits. Benefits are not yet available in all States. </p>
    <h3>Where to Apply?</h3>
    <p>People can apply for Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program benefits at state welfare
    offices, state public health departments, and state social service agencies. </p>
