<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">NOTE TO HEALTH PLANS: </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="+3">  </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">42 CFR 422.111(a)(3) requires that:  &quot;An M+C organization must disclose...information...at the time of enrollment and annually thereafter.&quot;  HCFA believes that in order to have relevance and in order to meet requirements of the law and regulations, an updated Evidence of Coverage (EOC) needs to be sent to all members by February 15, 2000.  For members who were not effective or enrolled on January 1, the EOC must be mailed within two weeks of the effective date of coverage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Prepared by the Health Care Financing Administration, Center for Health Plans and Providers, Health Plan Purchasing and Administration Group<B>.</B></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="+1">A Message from HCFA to Health Care Entities Participating in the Medicare + Choice Program</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) established a new program called the Medicare + Choice (M+C) program.  This program significantly expands the health care options available to Medicare beneficiaries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Balanced Budget Act defined the terms &quot;Medicare +Choice organization&quot; and &quot;Medicare + Choice plan&quot; in ways which are not always compatible with the way the terms &quot;organization&quot; and &quot;plan&quot; have been used in the past.  In previous HCFA documents, the term &quot;managed care organization&quot; was frequently used interchangeably with the term &quot;managed care plan&quot; or &quot;health plan&quot;.   Under the BBA, a Medicare + Choice organization is an entity that contracts with HCFA to offer a Medicare + Choice plan.  The Medicare + Choice plan consists of the specific health benefits, terms of coverage, and pricing structure.  The BBA also provides for several different types of Medicare + Choice plans to be available for beneficiaries.  One type of Medicare + Choice plan is a coordinated care plan, which includes health maintenance organizations (HMOs), provider-sponsored organization (PSOs), and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Medicare + Choice organizations have requested help in drafting membership rules.  This model Evidence of Coverage (EOC), also known as member contract or subscriber agreement, is in response to those requests.  Please note that this is a model and Medicare + Choice organizations are free to develop their own language.  However, approval will be expedited for those Medicare + Choice organizations choosing to use the model language.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It will simplify Regional Office review if you will highlight any changes you are making from your previously approved EOC.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The &quot;Lock-In&quot; feature is key to you and the [name of M+C Plan].

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Always ask to see your Primary Care Physician/Provider when you make an appointment.  Your Primary Care Physician/Provider is now responsible for all your routine health care services, so he or she should be the first one you call with any health concerns. When you select a Primary Care Physician/Provider it is important to remember that this may limit you to the panel of Specialists who are affiliated with your Primary Care Physician/Provider. [Note: Medicare +Choice Organizations should modify the PCP/specialist phrase to reflect the plans' own contractual circumstances.  If your plan uses formal subnetworks where each enrollee, by selecting a specific primary care provider, is also selecting an entire subnetwork to which his or her primary care provider can make referrals, you should include a complete explanation of this restriction here.]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Even though your Primary Care Physician/Provider is trained to handle the majority of common health needs, there may be a time when he or she feels you need more specialized treatment. In that case, you may receive a Referral to an appropriate Specialist.  In some cases this may be a specialist within our network that your Primary Care Physician/Provider has previously chosen to refer his or her patients to.  Not all specialists are available to all patients.  In some cases, the request for a Referral will need to have Prior Authorization from a Utilization Review Committee.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Once your Primary Care Physician's/Provider's Referral request is approved, an appointment will be set with the Specialist.

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you specifically request a particular service from your PCP or from a specialist or other provider you have been authorized to see, or if that PCP or specialist or other provider specifically requests authorization for a service for you from [name of M+C Organization] [or your Contracting Medical Group or IPA], it is a request for an organization determination on the service.  If you request in writing to [name of M+C Organization] [or your Contracting Medical Group or IPA] at [address] that [we/they] make payment for a service you have already received, it is a request for a [name of M+C Organization] determination on the payment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the case of a Standard Determination, [name of M+C Organization]  <I>[or your Contracting Medical Group or IPA]</I> must make a determination (decision) on your request for payment or provision of services within the following time frames:</FONT></P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Request for Service.  If you request services, or require Prior Authorization of a Referral for services, [name of M+C Organization]  <I>[or your Contracting Medical Group or IPA]</I> must make a decision as expeditiously as your health requires, but no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after receiving your request for service.  An extension of up to fourteen (14) calendar days is permitted, if you request the extension or if we have a need for additional information and the extension of time benefits you; for example, if we <I>[or your Contracting Medical Group or IPA]</I> need additional medical records from Non-Contracting Medical Providers that could change a denial decision. </FONT></LI></P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Requests for Payment.  If you request payment for services already received, the M+C Organization <I>[or your Contracting Medical Group or IPA]</I> will usually make a decision on whether or not to pay the claim no later than thirty (30) calendar days from receiving your request, but in no case will this period exceed sixty (60) days. </FONT></LI></P></UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[name of M+C Organization]  <I>[or your Contracting Medical Group or IPA]</I> must notify you in writing of any adverse decision (partial or complete) within the time frames listed above.  The notice must state the reasons for the denial and also must inform you of your right to a file an appeal.  If you have not received such a notice within fourteen (14) calendar days of your request for services, or within sixty (60) days of a request for payment, you may assume the decision is a denial, and you may file an appeal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you decide to proceed with the Medicare Standard Appeals Procedure, the following steps will occur:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. You must submit a written request for a reconsideration to [name of M+C Organization]  <I>[department name; i.e., Appeals and Grievance Unit]</I> at <I>[address].  </I>You may also request a reconsideration through the Social Security office (or, if you are a railroad retirement beneficiary, through a Railroad Retirement Benefits Office).

  <UL><P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Note: The sixty (60)-day limit may be extended for good cause.  Include in your written request the reason why you could not file within the sixty (60)-day time frame.</FONT></P>

</UL><P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2. [name of M+C Organization]  will conduct a reconsideration and notify you in writing of the decision, using the following time frames:</FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><LI><U><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Request for Service</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">.  If the appeal is for a denied service, we must notify you of the reconsideration decision as expeditiously as your health requires, but no later than thirty (30) days from receipt of your request.  We may extend this time frame by up to fourteen (14) days if you request the extension or if we need additional information, and the extension of time benefits you; for example, if we <I>[or your Contracting Medical Group or IPA]</I> need additional medical records from Non-Contracting Medical Providers that could change a denial decision.

<P><LI><U><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Request for Payment</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">.  If the appeal is for a denied claim, the M+C Organization must notify you of the reconsideration determination no later than sixty (60) days after receiving your request for a reconsideration determination.  </FONT></LI></P></UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Our reconsideration decision will be made by a person(s) not involved in the initial decision. All reconsiderations of adverse organization determinations based on &quot;lack of medical necessity&quot; must be made by a physician with appropriate expertise in the field of medicine appropriate for the services at issue.  You or your authorized representative may present or submit relevant facts and/or additional evidence for review either in person or in writing to the M+C Organization.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">3. If we decide fully in your favor on a request for a service, we must provide or authorize the requested service within thirty (30) days of the date we received your request for reconsideration.  If we decide fully in your favor on a request for payment, we must make the requested payment within sixty (60) days of the date we received your request for reconsideration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">4. If we decide to uphold the original adverse decision, either in whole or in part, we will automatically forward the entire file to the Center for Health Dispute Resolution (CHDR) for a new and impartial review.  CHDR is HCFA's independent contractor for appeal reviews involving Medicare+Choice managed care plans, like [the M+C Organization].  We must send CHDR the file within 30 days of a request for services and within 60 days of a request for payment.  CHDR will either uphold the M+C Organization's decision or issue a new decision.  If we forward the case to CHDR, we will notify you of our decision as discussed above.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">5. For cases submitted for review, CHDR will make a reconsideration decision and notify you in writing of their decision and the reasons for the decision.  If CHDR upholds our decision, their notice will inform you of your right to a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Social Security Administration (see below for further levels of appeal).  If CHDR (or a higher appeal level) decides in your favor, we must pay for,  provide or authorize the service as expeditiously as your health condition requires, but no later than 60 days from the date we receive notice reversing our decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If CHDR does not rule fully in your favor, there are further levels of appeal:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">6. If there is at least $100 in controversy, you may request a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) by submitting a written request with the M+C Organization, CHDR or the Social Security Administration within sixty (60) days of the date of CHDR's notice that the reconsideration decision was not in your favor.  This sixty- (60) day notice may be extended for good cause.  All hearing requests will be forwarded to CHDR.  CHDR will then forward your request and your reconsideration file to the hearing office.   [name of M+C Organization] will also be made a party to the appeal at the ALJ level.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">7. Either you or [name of M+C Organization]  may request a review of an ALJ decision by the Board, which may either review the decision or decline review.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">8. If the amount involved is $1000 or more, either you or [name of M+C Organization]  may request that a decision made by the DAB, or the ALJ if the DAB has declined review,  be reviewed by a Federal district court.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">9. Any initial or reconsidered decision made by [name of M+C Organization],  CHDR, the ALJ, or the Board can be reopened by any party (a) within twelve months, (b) within four (4) years for just cause, or (c) at any time for clerical correction of an error or in cases fraud.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">10. The reconsidered determination is final and binding upon the M+C Organization.  If there is a binding arbitration clause in your contract or on your individual election form, it does not apply to disputes subject to HCFA's appeals process.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Medicare Expedited/72 -Hour Determination and Appeal Procedure</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You have the right to request and receive expedited decisions affecting your medical treatment in &quot;Time-Sensitive&quot; situations.  A Time-Sensitive situation is a situation where waiting for a decision to be made within the time frame of the standard decision-making process could seriously jeopardize your life or health, or your ability to regain maximum function.  If [name of M+C Organization]  [or your Contracting Medical Group or IPA] decides, based on medical criteria, that your situation is Time-Sensitive or if any physician makes the request for you or calls or writes in support of your request for an expedited review, we will issue a decision as expeditiously as your health requires, but no later than seventy-two (72) hours after receiving the request.  We may extend this time frame by up to fourteen (14) days if you request the extension or if we need additional information, and the extension of time benefits you; for example, if we <I>[or your Contracting Medical Group or IPA]</I> need additional medical records from Non-Contracting Medical Providers that could change a denial decision.  Again, we must make a decision as expeditiously as your health requires, but no later than the end of any extension period.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Types of Decisions Subject to Expedited/72-Hour Review</FONT></U></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. Expedited Determinations.  If you believe you need a service, or continue to need a service,  and you believe it is a Time-Sensitive situation, you or any physician (including a physician with no connection to [name of M+C Organization]) may request that the decision be expedited.  If [name of M+C Organization]  decides that it is a Time-Sensitive situation, or if any physician states that it is one, we will make a decision on your request for a service on an expedited/72-hour basis (subject to an extension as discussed above).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2. Expedited Appeals.  If you want to request a reconsideration (appeal) of a decision by [name of M+C Plan] to deny a service you requested or to discontinue a service you are receiving that you believe is a Medically Necessary Covered Service and you believe it is a Time-Sensitive situation, you may request that the reconsideration (appeal) be expedited. If a physician wishes to file an expedited appeal for you, you must give him or her authorization to act on your behalf.  If we decide that it is a Time-Sensitive situation, or if any physician states that it is one, we will make a decision on your appeal on an expedited/72-hour basis.  We may extend this time frame by up to fourteen (14) days if you request the extension or if we need additional information, and the extension of time benefits you; for example, if we <I>[or your Contracting Medical Group or IPA]</I> need additional medical records from Non-Contracting Medical Providers that could change a denial decision.  Again, we must make a decision as expeditiously as your health requires, but no later than the end of any extension period.  Examples of service decisions which you may appeal on an expedited basis, when you believe it is a Time-Sensitive situation, include the following:</FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> If you received a denial of a service you requested;</FONT></LI></P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> If you think services are being discontinued too soon.   For example:</FONT></LI></P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> If you think your Home Health care is being discontinued too soon;</FONT></LI></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">How Your Expedited/72-Hour Determination/Review Request Will be Processed</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1.   Upon receiving your request for an expedited decision the [name of M+C Organization]  [or your Contracting Medical Group, or IPA] will determine if your request meets the definition of Time-Sensitive.</FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> If your request does not meet the definition, it will be handled within the standard review process.  You will be informed by telephone or in person whether your request will be processed through the expedited seventy-two (72) hour review or the standard review process. You will also be sent a written confirmation within two (2) working days of the phone call or personal contact.  If you disagree with [name of M+C Organization's]  decision to process your request within the standard time frame, you may file a grievance with [name of M+C Organization].  The written confirmation letter will include instructions on how to file a grievance.  If your request is Time-Sensitive, you will be notified of our decision as expeditiously as your health requires but no later than seventy-two (72) hours after we receive the request.</FONT></LI></P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> An extension up to fourteen (14) calendar days is permitted for a 72-hour request for determination/appeal, if you ask for the extension, or we need more information and the extension of time benefits you; for example, if you need time to provide us with additional information or if we need to have additional diagnostic testing completed.</FONT></LI></P></UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2. Your request must be processed within seventy-two (72) hours if any physician calls or writes in support of your request for an expedited/72-hour review, and the physician indicates that applying the standard review time frame could seriously jeopardize your life or health or your ability to regain maximum function.</FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> If a Non-Contracting Medical Provider supports your request, [name of M+C Organization]  [or your Contracting Medical Group or IPA] will have 72 hours from the time it receives all the necessary medical information from that Non-Contracting Provider it needs to make a decision.</FONT></LI></P></UL

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">3. The M+C Organization will make a decision on your request for determination/appeal and notify you of it within 72-hours of receipt of your request.  If we decide to uphold the original adverse decision, either in whole or in part, the entire file will be forwarded by the M+C Organization to CHDR for review as expeditiously as your health requires, but no later than 24 hours after our decision.  CHDR will send you a letter with their decision within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt of your case from [name of M+C Organization].</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are four possible dispositions to a request for expedited determination/appeal.  They are:</FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Your request to expedite our determination/appeal decision is approved, we make a decision in 72 hours and notify you that we will provide or continue the service.</FONT></LI></P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Your request to expedite our determination/appeal decision is approved, we make a decision in 72 hours and notify you that we will not provide or continue the service.</FONT></LI></P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Your request to expedite our determination/appeal decision is not approved, and we tell you that your request will be handled under the standard determination/appeal process.</FONT></LI></P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Your request to expedite our determination/appeal decision cannot be made in 72 hours, and we let you know that we will need up to an additional 14 days to process your request.</FONT></LI></P></UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you request an expedited determination/appeal, if you do not hear from us within 72 hours of your request, you can assume that your request has been denied.  Our failure to notify you in a timely manner - within 72 hours - constitutes a denial which you may appeal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you have questions regarding these rights, please call M+C Organization Customer Service at 1-800-XXX-XXXX [include TTY # for the &quot;hearing impaired&quot; - list hours of operation for both #s.]</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[Name of M+C Organization]  Grievance Procedures</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As a M+C Plan Member, you have the right to file a complaint -- also called a grievance -- about problems you observe or experience, including:</FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Complaints about the quality of services that you receive;</FONT></LI></P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Complaints regarding such issues as office waiting times, physician behavior, adequacy of facilities, or other similar Member concerns;</FONT></LI></P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Involuntary Disenrollment situations (see Section 8);</FONT></LI></P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> If you disagree with our decision to process your request for a service or to continue a service under the standard 14 day time frame rather than the</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="+1"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">expedited/72-hour time frame;</FONT></LI></P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> If you disagree with our decision to process your appeal request under the standard 30-day time frame rather than the expedited/72 hour time frame.</FONT></LI></P></UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We will attempt to resolve any complaint that you might have.  We encourage the informal resolution of complaints (i.e., over the telephone), especially if such complaints result from misinformation, misunderstanding or lack of information.  However, if your complaint cannot be resolved in this manner, a more formal Member grievance procedure is available.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To use the formal grievance procedure, submit your grievance in writing to the Customer Service department.  We will write you to let you know how we have addressed your concern within [number of days] of receiving your written grievance.  In some instances we will need additional time to address your concern.  If additional time is needed, the we will keep you informed regarding the status of your grievance. <I>[Include additional state-specific grievance procedures here.] </I>In either event, whether you use the formal (written) or informal (telephone) grievance procedure, we are required to track all appeals and grievances in order to report cumulative data to HCFA and to our members, upon request, beginning in early calendar year 2000.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However, complaints about a decision regarding payment for, or provision of, Covered Services that you believe are covered by Medicare and should be provided or paid for by the M+C Organization must be appealed through the M+C Organization's Medicare Appeals Procedure (see above).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Peer Review Organization (PRO) Immediate Review of Hospital Discharges</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You have the right to receive all the Hospital care that is necessary for the proper diagnosis and treatment of your illness or injury.  According to Federal law, your discharge date must be determined solely by your medical needs.  When you are being discharged from the hospital, you will receive a written notice of explanation called a &quot;Notice of Non-Coverage&quot; or &quot;Notice of Discharge and Medicare Appeal Rights.&quot;  This document outlines your rights, and you do not have to disagree with the noncoverage determination in order to receive it.  Either [name of M+C Organization] or the hospital is required to issue this notice.  You have the right to request a review by a Peer Review Organization (PRO) of any written Notice of Non-Coverage/Notice of Discharge and Medicare Appeal Rights that you receive from [name of M+C Organization] or from the Hospital on our behalf stating that we will no longer pay for your Hospital care.   Such a request must be made by noon of the first workday after you receive the Notice.  You cannot be made to pay for the Hospital care or services you received before the PRO made its decision and notified you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">PROs are groups of doctors who are paid by the Federal Government to review Medical Necessity, appropriateness, and quality of Hospital treatment furnished to Medicare patients, including those enrolled in a managed care plan (like [name of M+C Plan]).  The phone number and address of the PRO for your area is:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>[Insert PRO address and phone number </I>include TTY # for the &quot;hearing impaired&quot; (if available) - list hours of operation for both #s<I>]</I></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Note: You should review your Notice of Non-Coverage/Notice of Discharge and Medicare Appeal Rights to verify the address and phone number of the PRO responsible for the hospital in which you are a patient.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you ask for immediate review by the PRO by noon on the workday following a Notice of Non-Coverage/Notice of Discharge and Medicare Appeal Rights, you will be entitled to this process instead of the standard appeals process that is described above in this section.  You will also be protected from liability for hospital services you received before the PRO makes its decision.   Instead of PRO review you may appeal the Notice of Non-Coverage/Notice of Dischange and Medicare Appeal Rights within 60 days as discussed above by requesting that [name of M+C Organization] reconsider the decision.  The advantage of the PRO review is that you will get the results within three working days if you request the review on time.  Also, you are not financially liable for hospital charges incurred during the PRO review process.  This same protection does not apply in the case of the [name of M+C Organization] reconsideration process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Note: You may file an oral or written request for an expedited/72-hour [name of M+C Organization] appeal only if you have missed the deadline for requesting the PRO review.  If you do not seek PRO review, however, and seek an expedited reconsideration of the Organization Determination, you will be financially responsible for the hospital costs incurred from the date the Notice of Non-coverage/Notice of Discharge and Medicare Appeal Rights is issued if the Original Determination to discharge you is upheld through the appeal process.  Specifically state that you have missed the immediate PRO review deadline, you want an expedited (or 72-hour) appeal and that you believe your health could be seriously harmed by waiting for a standard appeal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Peer Review Organization Quality of Care Complaint Process</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you are concerned about the quality of care you have received, you may also file a complaint with the Peer Review Organization (PRO) in your local area.  (The name, address and telephone number of your local PRO are referenced in the section above.)   </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We are required by law to inform you of your right to make health care decisions and to execute advance directives. <B>An advance directive is a formal document, written by you in advance of an incapacitating illness or injury.</B> As long as you can speak for yourself, Contracting Medical Providers will honor your wishes.  But, if you become so sick that you cannot speak for yourself, then this directive will guide your health care Providers in treating you and will save your family, friends and physicians from having to guess what you would have wanted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There may be several types of advance directives you can choose from, depending on state law. Most states recognize:</FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> DPAHC (Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care),</FONT></LI></P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Living Wills, and</FONT></LI></P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Natural Death Act Declarations.</FONT></LI></P></UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This <I>[Insert any State specific language</I>] form allows you to appoint an agent (family, friend or other person) whom you trust to make treatment decisions for you should there come a time you are unable to make them yourself. You can purchase the form from a stationery store or ask for a form from your Contracting Medical Provider, a [name of M+C Organization]  Customer Service Representative or social worker.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is necessary that you provide copies of your completed directive to:</FONT></P>

<OL TYPE=1>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">your Primary Care Physician,</FONT></LI</P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">your agent, and</FONT></LI></P>

<P><LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">your family.</FONT></LI></P></OL>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Be sure to keep a copy with you and take a copy to the Hospital when you are hospitalized for medical care.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You are not required to initiate an advance directive, and you will not be denied care if you do not have an advance directive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you believe your Provider has not complied with your Advanced Directive, you may file a complaint with [List appropriate state specific agency here].</FONT></P>

<a name="11"><P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="+1">Section 11 - Coordinating other Benefits You May Have </FONT></B></P></a>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Who Pays First?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you are aged 65 or older and have coverage under an employer group plan of an employer of twenty (20) or more employees, either based on your own current employment or the current employment of a spouse, you must use the benefits under that plan.  Similarly, if you have Medicare based on disability and are covered under an employer group plan of an employer of one hundred (100) or more employees (or a multiple employer plan that includes an employer of one hundred or more employees) either through your own current employment or that of a family member, you must use the benefits under that plan.  In such cases, you will only receive benefits not covered by your employer group plan through our contract with Medicare.  A special rule applies if you have or develop End-State Renal Disease (ESRD).  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If any no-fault or any liability insurance (or payment from a liable third party) is available to you, then benefits under that plan (or from that liable third party) must be applied to the costs of health care covered by this plan.  Where we have provided benefits and a judgment or settlement is made with a no fault or liability insurer (or liable third party), you must reimburse us.  However, our reimbursement may be reduced by a share of procurement costs (e.g., attorney fees and costs).  Workers' compensation for treatment of a work-related illness or injury should also be applied to covered health care costs by this plan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you have (or develop) ESRD and are covered under an employer group plan, you must use the benefits of that plan for the first thirty (30) months after becoming eligible for Medicare based on ESRD.  Medicare is the primary payer after this coordination period.  (However, if your employer group plan coverage was secondary to Medicare when you developed ESRD because it was not based on current employment as described above, Medicare continues to be primary payer.)  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Because of this, we may ask you for information about other insurance you may have. If you have other insurance, you can help us obtain payment from the other insurer by providing the information we request promptly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Coordination of benefits protects you from higher Plan Premiums. The end result is more affordable health care.</FONT></P>
