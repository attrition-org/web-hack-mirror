    schools in a cost-effective, affordable and appropriate manner.</font><p><font size="3">The
    web-handbook, &quot;<em>The Appropriate and Effective Use of Security Technologies in U.S.
    Schools</em>,&quot; is a practical guide for school officials.&nbsp; Its findings are
    based on a seven-year study by the Department of Energy's (DOE) Sandia National
    Laboratories of more than 100 schools.&nbsp; It offers practical guidance on several
    aspects of security, including security concepts and operational issues, video
    surveillance, weapons detection devices, entry codes, and duress alarms.&nbsp; The
    document is available on DOE's website:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.doe.gov/schoolsecurity/pdf.htm"><strong>http://www.doe.gov/schoolsecurity/pdf.htm</strong></a></font></p>

    putting the handbook on the web in an effort to reach the widest possible audience because
    this handbook puts proven techniques for combating school security problems in the hands
    of school administrators, school boards and others who are facing decisions about school
    safety investments.</font><p><font size="3">&quot;School security remains a top priority
    for school officials and parents alike as more school systems across the country rely on
    the latest high tech tools to protect school children.&nbsp; School officials are adding
    high resolution cameras, motion detectors, hand-held metal detectors, and bar-coded
    student ID cards in their arsenal of security measures.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">This guidebook is practical consumer's guide for school and law
    enforcement officials alike.&nbsp; It provides practical advice on what's available in the
    marketplace, and what works, so they can make informed decisions and not buy security
    devices that may not suit their needs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The handbook provides school administrators and law enforcement
    officials information on the kinds of security products available on the market and the
    strengths and weaknesses of these products and their expected effectiveness in a school
    environment.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">It contains charts of the costs of these products, including a practical
    guide outlining the costs of installation, long-term operational and maintenance expenses.
    &nbsp; It also catalogs manpower and training costs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The handbook outlines security technologies and proven techniques for
    combating school security problems.&nbsp; It is a joint enterprise of the Department of
    Energy, the Department of Justice and the Department of Educations.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Sandia National
    Laboratories has emerged as one of the nation's leading experts on school security issues.
    &nbsp; Sand's expertise in school security comes from decades of DOE-sponsored work
    designing, protecting and evaluating security at high-risk nuclear facilities. &nbsp;
    Although the threats at high-risk government-owned facilities are radically different from
    those of the school house, Sandia is using its expertise to protect students and deter
    crime on school campuses.</font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
