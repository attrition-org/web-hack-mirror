UPDATE</b></i></font><font size="2"></p>

<p align="justify">During the October 15, 1999 Mound Reuse Committee meeting, the PRS 66
Sampling Plan was presented for further comment. Rick Provencher, DOE Site Director, MEMP,
stated during his update that comments received from stakeholders including EHS,
University of Cincinnati, MESH, City of Miamisburg, and NIN had been incorporated into the
Sampling Plan. Upon further discussion, it was agreed that revision to one section of the
Sampling Plan will continue in parallel with the beginning of PRS 66 sampling which began
on October 19, 1999.</font><font color="#000080" face="Arial Narrow" size="4"><i><b></p>

<p align="justify">The Mound Action Committee (MAC) met on October 15, 1999. Attendees
include: Dann Bird, MMCIC; Brian Nickel, Ohio EPA; Jane Greenwalt, DOE, Anthony Campbell,
OHEPA and Dottie Atkins, BWXT of Ohio.</p>

<p align="justify">Jane Greenwalt discussed the defunct Marion facility in Ohio, and the
reason why it has been in the Cleveland and Columbus area news. Review of archived
documents indicate the facility was never used. The facility was built as a backup to the
Mound facility, but was never activated. Review of archived information is continuing.</font><font
face="Arial" size="2"></p>
</font><font size="2">

<p align="justify">A suggestion for a future MAC meeting was proposed during the meeting.
Presentation of the tritium profile of the Mound facility would benefit members by
enhancing understanding of Mound. Dottie Atkins announced that a the railcar tour would
not be possible on October 19 because that railcars are not scheduled to be on site that
week. MAC members will be informed of the new date. The MAC meeting adjourned, and members
attended the Mound Reuse Committee meeting at the same location.</p>

<p align="justify">The next MAC meeting scheduled for 9:00, November 12, 1999 at the
Miamisburg Civic Center, Activities Room 10 North First Street, Miamisburg (937)866-3303.
All interested parties are invited to attend. For further information, please contact Jane
Greenwalt at (937) 865-3116.</p>

<p></font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Times New Roman">During the PRS 99/100
project to remove contaminated material in the parking lot, it was decided to follow up
drilling samples with trenching to encompass the complete anomaly.&nbsp; Trenches allow
for visual inspection of waste areas compared to small samples from drilling.&nbsp; The
excavation did in fact locate the earlier suspected waste material.&nbsp; Excavation
continued until all waste material located (including metal debris), sand, or dissimilar
soils were removed and bedrock was encountered.&nbsp; Verification samples were collected
in both the vertical and horizontal directions and the area was backfilled to grade.
&nbsp; The waste was containerized and is awaiting shipment to a disposal facility.</font><font

Work Permit (RWP) and Health and Safety Plan prescribed standard-of-the-industry
protection for the workers specific to task and work area.&nbsp; Those plans were updated
as necessary to ensure continued worker safety.&nbsp; Daily meeting with workers were held
to emphasize safety and present new or noteworthy tasks and/or hazards associated with
activities planned for the day.&nbsp; Radiological surveys, air monitoring, and sampling
of soil and debris documented that workers were protected.</font></font></p>
