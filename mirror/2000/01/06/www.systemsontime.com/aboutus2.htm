Since 1996, Systems OnTime has been supplying our clients with IT resources.&nbsp; When
you meet someone from Systems OnTime, you can be confident that you are meeting with
someone who has years of industry experience and is able to understand your requirements.
&nbsp; Systems OnTime is run by individuals who are enthusiastic about technology; in
order to keep up to date on the latest IT news, we are involved with several user groups
and associations.&nbsp; </p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>A Commitment To Our Clients:</strong></font><br>
At Systems OnTime we take pride in our ability to provide excellent, technically qualified
individuals, both contract and permanent who will meet your needs.&nbsp; Since all our
recruiters have a technical background and were once programmers or are still involved in
the technical field, we can understand your needs from a systems perspective.</p>

<p>We source our candidates from a database of approximately 20,000 IT professionals and
this pool continues to grow.&nbsp; Obviously our database contains a mix of talents - some
more talented than others.&nbsp; Therefore, before sending any contractor to our clients
we initiate a rigorous interview process involving a meeting with the candidates, an
aptitude and IT skills test, and finally, verifying their references.&nbsp; We aim to
provide you with systems professionals you can rely on to deliver your projects on
time.&nbsp; This is an uncompromising standard at Systems OnTime.</p>
