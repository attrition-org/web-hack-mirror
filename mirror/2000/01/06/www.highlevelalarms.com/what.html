    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Dec. 99</strong></small></small></font><p><strong><font face="Verdana"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp; </big><font color="#0000FF">I<small><small><small>t used
    to be that alarms systems were wired in and this greatly limited how one could utilize the
    technology. Alas, wireless has entered the scene and after years of evolving, we've
    finally got a product that's not only versatile but also highly reliable.</small></small></small></font></font></strong></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF"><strong><small><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Without
    the wire, all sorts of new applications are at hand. In a home environment, you are no
    longer confined to the interior of the house itself. It's easy to add a door contact to an
    unattached garage, or to a shed.&nbsp; I keep a motion detector inside my boat and if
    anyone dares enter it, they're going to be awfully surprised.</small></small></strong></font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; I<small><small><small>n a
    business environment, we'd occasionally get businesses that had rented a separate office
    on the floor above for storing supplies and the like.&nbsp; It was often not cost
    effective to add another alarm system for one single room but now, we simply add a
    wireless door contact, or a motion detector and the job is done.&nbsp; Best of all, it's
    done in minutes.</small></small></small></strong></font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">Other Applications</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Verdana"><small><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; </small></small><font color="#0000FF">L<small><small><small>et's say you're travelling in an RV or pulling a
    trailer, a boat or anything that you feel uncomfortable leaving, while you go to sleep in
    a road side motel, or even in the residence of a friend.&nbsp; Wouldn't it be nice to be
    awakened if someone intruded upon your private property?</small></small></small></font></font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF"><small><strong><small><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; No
    problem. Put a wireless door contact on it, or a motion detector within it and plug your
    alarm system into any outlet inside your hotel room. These new wireless have a pretty good
    range and you're sure to know, if somebody is messing with your stuff.</small></small></strong></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF"><small><strong><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>
    Similarly, boats at Marina's are often susceptible to intruders. Place a motion detector
    in the boat and plug the control unit into an outlet in the main building and you can
    alert the staff, or even have central station call police.</small></small></strong></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF"><strong><small><small><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; </small></small></small>T<small><small><small>hese
    new wireless are very impressive. False alarms are nearly a thing of the past and the
    number of new uses are up to your imagination.&nbsp; The prices may be low but the quality

    <p></font><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF" <p size="2"><big><big>A</big></big><small><small>larm
    manufacturers advise that every alarm system be tested once weekly. In some instances,
    tiny sticker labels are even provided with new systems to assure that everyone knows that
    a system needs to be tested in order to validate that it's functioning properly.&nbsp; All
    too often however, the first test is done by the installer and the second is done by the
    customer, only when he accidentally activates the alarm.</small></small></font><font <p size="2" face="Verdana"></p>
    <p></font><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF" <p size="2"><small><small>False alarms are
    a really big problem and to the police, any alarm that they respond to, not caused by a
    burglar, is 'False' and worse yet, a nuisance.&nbsp; Let's face it, it cost money, time
    and manpower.</small></small></font><font <p size="2" face="Verdana"></p>
    <p></font><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF" <p size="2"><big><big>U</big></big><small><small>nfortunately,
    there is actually a minor, but relevant, good side to False Alarms.&nbsp; If it weren't
    for the occasional false alarm, many people who never test their systems, would simply
    never know that their system actually works.&nbsp; We've had numerous calls from people
    who verbalize, that they have just discovered that the police, do respond.&nbsp; </small></small></font><font <p size="2" face="Verdana"></p>
    <p></font><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF" <p size="2"><small><small>This brings up
    two points and both revolve around, or equate, customer negligence.&nbsp; When you have an
    alarm system installed, you have accepted at least two responsibilities, whether you know
    it, or not. &nbsp; The first responsibility occurs upon accidentally activating your
    system.&nbsp; When this happens, you must assure that the police are not dispatched by
    either contacting your central station, or by giving central your password when they call.
    Failing this, the police will visit your house or business and this may soon be followed
    by fines.&nbsp; In most areas these days, you're only allowed x number of false alarms
    annually, before having to pay for each false alarm thereafter. </small></small></font><font <p size="2" face="Verdana"></p>
    <p></font><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF" <p size="2"><small><small>The next issue
    has to do with equipment that causes the alarm.&nbsp; Although we provide the best
    available alarm products, anything electronic can experience a failure. &nbsp; Sorry, but
    it does happen occasionally, but not often.&nbsp; I hear you saying, &quot;well, this
    isn't customer negligence,&quot; and granted that's true.&nbsp; However, when a customer
    has one true false alarm and doesn't report it to us, we can't fix it, if we don't know
    it's broke. The first false alarm needs to be reported and repaired immediately.&nbsp;
    After that, you will likely get years more trouble free operation.</small></small></font><font <p size="2" face="Verdana"></p>
    <p></font><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF" <p size="2"><big><big>R</big></big><small><small>emember
    I said that&nbsp; there is a good side to false alarms?&nbsp; Unbelievably, we recently
    got a referral from a customer's, neighbor, who was impressed that the police has
    responded to his house so often.&nbsp; Although, it's nice to get referrals, we still
    prefer that neighbors only realize that there is an alarm next door, via our window
    stickers.&nbsp; This customer fell into the, 'not reporting it to us,' category.&nbsp;
    Also, his equipment was nearly ten years old and though advised to replace it, he wouldn't
    spend the bucks. &nbsp;We told him that bad equipment is worse than no equipment but the
    customer preferred to place the blame for the false alarms on us and continued to use the
    faulty part.&nbsp; He also cancelled his monitoring, since the police were about to fine
    him for repeated offenses, so he now has a local alarm only, that is subject to constant
    self activation, without cause.</small></small></font><font <p size="2" face="Verdana"></p>
    <p></font><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF" <p size="2"><small><small>False alarms,
    that is, where the police respond for no reason, are bad for all concerned. &nbsp; We're
    doing everything we can to completely eliminate them but factually, we can't do it without
    customer cooperation.&nbsp; It's a group effort and your assistance could make a big
    difference.&nbsp; We can't guarantee that every customer will participate in this effort
    but we hope they will and we want everyone to know that were giving it our best.</small></small></font><font <p size="2" face="Verdana"></p>
    <p></font><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF" <p size="2"><big><big>W</big></big><small><small>e're
    committed to this cause and the first thing that we try to convey to every customer is
    that, false alarms are not a normal part of owning an alarm system.&nbsp; Unlike some
    companies, we are always there to help you solve a problem and if you'll just let us know
    about it, you can count on us to get over this hill, quickly and without a fuss.&nbsp;
