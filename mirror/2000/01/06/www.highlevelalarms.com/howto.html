    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Dec.
    99</font></font></small><p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000A0"><small><strong>E</strong><small>very
    alarm company out there is going to tell you that they're the best, that's the nature of
    sales. So do you just look for the lowest price and save every penny that you can and let
    it go at that, or should you dig a little deeper? Unfortunately, too many people only look
    at the dollar figure and then accept, come what may.This is a huge mistake when purchasing
    an alarm system and here's why.&nbsp; </small></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000A0"><small><small>Let's say that two different
    companies are selling the exact same product, then you'd think that only the bottom line
    makes the difference but when buying on the Net, that could be very wrong. </small></small></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" color="#0000A0"><small><img src="images/some_simple_tips.gif" width="294" height="77" alt="some simple tips.gif (3410 bytes)"></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000A0"><small><strong>H</strong><small>ere are the
    additional questions that you need to ask but more importantly, that you somehow need to
    assert.</small></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000A0"><small><small>1.All of today's alarm systems need
    to be programmed for a variety of different factors. Therefore, is this included in the
    price? The seller will save many hours if it isn't but what you'll get is factory default
    and very likely, it'll be little more than an ongoing problem for you. This really should
    be included at no charge.</small></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000A0"><small><small>2.After the systems arrives, there's
    a better than average chance that it's going to need changes in the program to better suit
    your individual living conditions and needs. So, will this be done for free, or are you
    going to have to pay for it every time? Do you really want to pay $10 to $50. if you just
    decided that you could use an additional 5 seconds to get in the door before the alarm
    activates? All programming should be included even after the sale at no additional charge.</small></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000A0"><small><small>3.If something fails to function,
    and so long as things are electronic it can happen, then will the company take back your
    part and replace it with a new one without giving you grief and aggravation? This is a
    tough one but if you've asked the question and gotten a favorable response, at least
    you've got a chance of things going smoothly down the road. A one year parts replacement
    is normally expected, but ask anyway.</small></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000A0"><small><strong>A</strong><small>n alarm system is
    something that you may live with for many years to come, that is if you select the right
    one. Just like computers, something new is born everyday. Make sure by asking a lot of
    questions, that this is indeed the latest technology. Here's a great example: The smoke
    detectors that our system uses is called the 5808 model. Apparently, that model was
    discovered to have some sort of technical problem and all of the remaining stock of that
    model number was sold to one of the big guys in the alarm industry, who no doubt bought
    the supply at a very reduced rate.</small></small></font></p>
    <p><img src="images/paging.jpg" width="497" height="373" alt="paging.BMP (921654 bytes)"></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000A0"><small><small>We sure wouldn't install something
    like that for our customers, so now we have to wait until the next model number is
    introduced. We will no doubt lose money and sales over this issue but on the other hand,
    our customers only get the best.&nbsp; It wouldn't be worth it for us to buy junk and then
    sell you junk, even when you couldn't tell the difference until that faithful day when it
    failed to do the job.&nbsp; Bottom line on that issue, is that you need to find an alarm
    company with a conscience. If you rush to buy at the lowest possible price, then you'll
    have to live with whatever you get, or maybe die with it.</small></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000A0"><small><strong>T</strong><small>ry this on for
    size. Let's say that you decide that you'd rather have a local alarm company than a do it
    yourself, and that we're not in your local area. We offer you a chance to tell us what
    system you think you want to get and we'll tell you if it's a good system, a bad system,
    and if we know the company, we'll tell you about them, too. In other words, we'll offer
    advice, even if there is nothing in it for us. Just email us and see.</small></small></font></p>

    <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><big><strong>When Assessing Installations - Nov. 99</strong></big></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><big><big>I</big></big><small>t's one thing to decide you want an
    alarm system but another to figure out what's best for you, and how you're going to assess
    the parts you need. Actually, it really isn't all that difficult, so we'll give you a few
    simple tips on how to do it quick and easy.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>No matter what you're trying to protect, be it a home,
    business, etc, the thinking is still basically the same. First of all, since doors are
    more often than not the primary point of break ins, let's protect all doors. <em>Just
    count em up and jot it down.&nbsp; </em></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><big><big>N</big></big><small>ow since you're shopping on the
    Internet for an alarm system, I'm going to assume that you are trying to save money, so
    we're not going to be frivolous about buying lots of stuff that you may not really need.
    That means, we won't protect windows individually, unless you meet one of two criteria:
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. You have assessed that this is a very serious need for your particular
    environment or 2. You've got plenty of cash that you don't know what to do with. In the
    event that you feel you fit category number one, then we'll explore the matter more
    closely so that you can come to a logical conclusion. If per chance you fit category
    number two, then don't bother reading on, just give us a call.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Before we move on to other items, let's look at your window
    situation because money is almost always a factor.&nbsp; Do you have windows that are very
    close to the ground and very easily accessed?&nbsp; Worse yet, are they in the back of the
    house or business, or hidden behind fences or shrubbery? If you said &quot;yes&quot;, then
    maybe you do need to protect windows. If it's only one or two, then maybe you want to just
    go for it but before you decide however, remember that each window will be costly and
    therefore, give consideration to the alternatives.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><big><big>W</big></big><small>hat are the alternatives? Well glad
    you asked. One of the least used is glass break detection. I have them in my house, of
    course, I have everything in my house. The funny thing is, I always wonder if they'll work
    because I've never smashed in a window just to find out.&nbsp; I'm psychologically sure
    that they will but I'm not comforted by having them alone, that is, without a back up of
    some sort. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>As glass detectors go, these are high end units.&nbsp; You
    put them on the ceiling, peel and stick tape, or on a wall near a window. One unit is
    usually sufficient for an entire average size room. They are activated by two things,
    which cuts down on false alarms. First they must hear the sound of breaking glass and then
    there is a pressure change within the room, which now sends the unit into alarm. Not bad,
    really.</small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Somehow, I prefer infra red motion detection, which is my
    back up, in any case.&nbsp; They do not see through walls, or windows, or any solid
    object.&nbsp; When placed in a corner of a room without obstacles in it, they see
    virtually the entire room up to a distance of around 45 feet. Out latest units are pet
    immune, so kitty or little dogs up to forty pounds are OK. Better yet, those business
    locations with mice and that sort of thing are now OK, too.&nbsp; You'll need at least one
    motion detector per accessible landing.&nbsp; Use it as a trap zone where a burglar will
    have to pass and cover the most square feet you can with every unit. <em>&nbsp; Count em
    up and jot it down.</em></font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><big><big>T</big></big><small>hat's about it. Now, go back to the
    windows and decide if you really need to protect them and if so, add them into the
    equation.&nbsp; If for some reason you prefer glass break, add those in, too.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Now that you've got a pretty good concept of your own
    environment and what you want and need, feel free to call us for any additional
    information. Give us your tally of items and we'll give you a price.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><big><big>O</big></big><small>ne little note: Understanding all of
    this stuff, how it works, and what to expect of it, is a lot easier if you've got
    something to gain the experience from, instead of buying, more or less, blindly. &nbsp;
    That's why we designed a small package, that's actually suitable 'as is' for many
    locations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not order the 2001, install it, and go from there.&nbsp;
    Expanding is extremely easy, up to twenty four points, and you'll have first hand
    knowledge before you buy anything more.&nbsp; We really don't want you to buy the wrong
    items, or things that you don't need. We do want you to be completely satisfied.</small></font></p>
    <p><small>Always remember that unlike some large corporations, we care and we'll be there,
    for you.&nbsp; We're easy to talk to, so go to &quot;Questions&quot; and see for
    yourself.&nbsp; </small></p>
