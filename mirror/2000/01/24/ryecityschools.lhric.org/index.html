Sorry for the crappy html.  Anyways,  I was just taking time to say that
I'm disapointed.  I planned like a few major hacks, and you dopey admins fix the
hole at the last second when I'm actually going to do it.  I'm glad atleast this one is clueless.  ;)<br>
Oh well.

Shouts to: Syonic, OutOfBound, Goldan, ze1tge1st, & baller of Zer0-g, and also the dd2
team, nemesystm, and sectorx.
