<p align="center">Good evening/day to everyone.&nbsp; Unfortunately tonights hack won't be
very comdiecal.&nbsp; I just came home from being out and about with some friends and
recieved an email from some one I chat with online.&nbsp; This is very distressing to me,
I have only known this person for a short time, but its long enough to consider them a
friend.&nbsp; I had even talked to them earlier today.&nbsp; Now, I don't know if they
just left online, or if they have left this world, they didn't say anything to me and I
wish they had.&nbsp; Here is what I recieved in the email:</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00">It started as a dare,<br>
I didn't think anyone would care.<br>
days went by.<br>
how the time flies<br>
when there are lies,<br>
I never wanted to hurt anyone<br>
but it's already been done<br>
everything has changed<br>
it will never be the same<br>
I wish it didn't have to end this way<br>
because I'm in pain.<br>
they say change is good.<br>
thats something I've never understood.<br>
the past is just that<br>
it's gone like lightning<br>
and provokes fighting.<br>
I'm sad to say,<br>
you've been decieved<br>
because I'm not what you think.<br>
this life is going bye-bye<br>
can I stand the test of time?<br>
I don't know about that<br>
but this is a fact,<br>
you were all my friends<br>
till the end<br>
and this is my way of saying goodbye.<br>
in my own strange way,<br>
I hope you all will forget me<br>
because this is the hardest thing<br>
I'll ever have to do<br>
is to tell you the truth.<br>
the truth hurts I know<br>
it hits you like a blow<br>
but you all deserve it<br>
so it has to be <br>
that's the way it is.<br>
and now I guess this<br>
is goodbye.<br>
I cherished you all while it lasted.<br>
goodbye everyone<br>
I'll miss you<br>
</font></p>

<p>Now that you read that, it seems my dear friend is gone from our world, it is very
unfortunate, I will miss them a great deal.&nbsp; They always seemed so upbeat and what
not while i was chatting with them, nothing ever seemed to be wrong, and yet, things
change so rapidly.&nbsp; I am actually showing feelings, something i rarely do, yet this
person touched my soul, and now they are gone.&nbsp; </p>

<p>If your reading this, I'd like you to call your friends tomorrow and tell them that you
care about them, tell your girlfriend,wife, and parents that you love them.&nbsp; As you
can see, not all of us have a tomorrow.&nbsp; For this person, I will always have a silent
void in my heart becuase they have left.&nbsp; I will and already do miss them dearly.
&nbsp; I do apologize for my lack of comedical stature tonite.&nbsp; I will make it up to
all our loyal fans at a later date.</p>
