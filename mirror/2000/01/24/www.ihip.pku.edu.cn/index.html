Major FUCK YOU's to: Chinese Government for stealing nuclear secrets from us in order to
make weapons of mass destruction to use against us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>
You've stolen secrets from us. We have helped your country become more economically viable
and still you shit on us. You conspire to destroy us with weapons of mass distruction, and
think we've turned a blind eye! You are wrong!</p>

<p><br>
Do not think we have forgotten, if you did you are foolish. We know of your lust for an
empire run from Beijing. You are amssing forces in order to attack Taiwan, an island that
wants only freedom. After that, what? Help your fellow communist nation, North Korea,
attack and takeover South Korea, in order to unite all people under your tyrannical rule?
We are watching you. We know your every move! One wrong step and you will face wraths,
both politically and militarily.</p>

<p><br>
Your People's Republic is anything but. They yearn for freedom, you squash them with tank
treads and annihilate them with AK-47 rounds. Freedom is something given only to those in
power. The corrupt who run your government 'in the interests of the people'.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>
Thus I charge you, people of China, unite! Stand up against this tyrannical rule. Make it
a true People's Republic of China! Take destiny into your own hands and rule it! Don't
leave it to those who would use to their own destructible end! Unite and fight! You have
the sympathy and support of many in the world. With their help and your hardwork and
determination, you to can be free to live without the yoke of tyranny!</p>
