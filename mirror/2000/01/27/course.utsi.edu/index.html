<p align="left">Team Echo has been reading through some publications lately and watching
alot of television and we are noticing more and more how fucked up the judicial system and
media have become. The bullshit has increased dramatically. It's insane how simply
entering a system and replacing a .html file and adding .jpg file can get you years in
prison and fines! When you look at the defacing community today and PAY ATTENTION...you
will see that most of us deface becuase we like to do it. We show the admins that they
have fucked up and that their systems security is non-existant. People ask why we don't
just email them. YEAH RIGHT!!!!&nbsp; Do you have a fuckin clue how many admins Team Echo
has emailed? For 3 weeks straight we emailed 32 admins at 32 different systems and got ONE
response.....this admin STILL has not fixed his site and I gave him SPECIFIC directions
how to. Sometimes defacing is a way to let stress out, to express ourselves, and sometimes
it's just for pure fun. It' amazing that a guy can kill someone and spend 19 months in
prison but a 18 year old kid can hack www. *** . com and go to prison for 3 years and get
fined thousands of dollars.........how fucked up is our country?</p>
