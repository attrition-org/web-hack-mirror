Setting up so many domains can sometimes become a little tedious....

Hello again,<br>
We're really happy with the speed of the server, so far everyone we've
asked to try the site from their computer has said it is much faster now and
no problem downloading the pictures (which sometimes failed on the old
server).<br>

Yeah - we're really pleased with them.  We don't hide the fact that our servers are based in Connecticut.  They are connected directly to the T3 backbone there which explains the speed of connection.  They're monitored 24 hours per day and we guarantee 99.8% uptime.<br>The servers do slow down once a day for about 15 minutes when they are being backed up but it's usually barely noticable.</b></TD></TR></TABLE>

Doug,<br>I just wanted you to know what a joy it has been to move <A HREF="http://www.cetacea.org/">CETACEA</A> to
webspace with Your-Name-Here instead of with GeoCities. The move was
effortless and very easy, with the aid of the 'help mail' you sent.
Settling in was not hard, either, unlike with so-called 'free' webhosters,
and there is no longer the irritation of pop-up advertisements which
distract visitors to the site.
<P>
Your help and enthusiasm has been commendable. Your prices are so
attractive that it was even possible for a student to buy her own
webspace! Thank you so much. You provide a wonderful service and it is a
pleasure - and a relief - to know that Your-Name-Here is hosting CETACEA.
<P>
Yours,
<P>

I moved my domain name to your servers last week, and I would simply like
to say that this has been one of the most hastle free experiences of my
life.  The last mob I was with was "difficult" to say the least, whereas
your service has been sensational.  Thanks very much.
<p>
I have another query.  I want to register a new domain name and have it
hosted there, however I also want to register the variations of the name
and have them point to the same site.  For example, a-coghlan.co.uk and
acoghlan.co.uk and a_coghlan.co.uk all pointing to the same site.  (these
are not the real names!)
<p>
How much will this cost?  Is it a single hosting fee with multiple fees
for the domain names?  Do I have to pay separately for each name to be
hosted at your site?  Could you please send me some info.
<p>
Again, thanks again for your excellent service, and for your prompt
responses to date.
<p>
Regards
<p>

<b>Wow..thanks for your comments</b><p>

Ok...parked domains<br>
<b>You'll like this!</b><p>

Obviously the charge for domain names is separate
so....£47 for each .co.uk name and £70 for .com etc
<p>
Hosting<br>
if you want to point multiple domain names at the same 
webspace this is called parking<br>
As an example see my other project at:<br>
<p>
<a HREF="http://www.best-hotel.com">http://www.best-hotel.com</a><br>
<a HREF="http://www.best-inn.com">http://www.best-inn.com</a><br>
<a HREF="http://www.best-accommodation.com">http://www.best-accommodation.com</a><br>
<a HREF="http://www.best-hotel.co.uk">http://www.best-hotel.co.uk</a><br>

<p>
All are separate domain names-all retain their
identity as the viewer navigates BUT they all
point to the same web space.
<p>
The good news is we charge £50 to park
a domain name to the main one<br>
...and this is just a one-off charge NOT ANNUAL - (as most of our competitors charge)
<p>
So as long as you keep paying annual subs for main hosting package
your parked domains wil remain active with nothing more to pay
<p>
The emails even work for the separate domains!!<br>
ie an email to:<br>
<a HREF="mailto:office@best-hotel.com">office@best-hotel.com</a><br>
<a HREF="mailto:office@best-inn.com">office@best-inn.com</a><br>
<a HREF="mailto:office@best-accommodation.com">office@best-accommodation.com</a><br>
<a HREF="mailto:office@best-hotel.co.uk">office@best-hotel.co.uk</a><br>
<a HREF="mailto:office@all-hotels.co.uk">office@all-hotels.co.uk</a><br>

...will all find me
<p>
Thanks again and we're glad you're happy<p>
