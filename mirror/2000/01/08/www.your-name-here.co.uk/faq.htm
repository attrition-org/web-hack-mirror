<br clear=all>
You may want to save this and read it off-line<br>
If you do please be sure to come back frequently for updates: <br><a HREF="faq.htm">http://www.your-name-here.co.uk/faq.htm</a><br clear=all><p>
<li><b><font COLOR=#000000>What do I get with a domain name?</font></b></li><p>
Just that, the right to use that name for an initial period of two years, subject to certain conditions.<p>
<li><b><font COLOR=#000000>Does it include web hosting, my own site, e-mails, etc.?</font></b></li><p>
No, it just allows the use of the name. You will need to get an ISP (Internet Service Provider) who will "host" your site on their server, unless you want to do this for yourself.<p>
<li><b><font COLOR=#000000>Can I get one of the "free" servers to host it for me?</font></b></li><p>
Well you can try, and in theory there is no reason why not, but as far as we know, there are no free ISPs who will host your own domain name for you free of charge. If you find one, let us know!<p>
<li><b><font COLOR=#000000>Why won't the "free" servers host my site using my own domain name?</font></b></li><p>
We don't know, you will have to ask them. We would be interested in their replies.<p>
<li><b><font COLOR=#000000>Can you "park" or store it for me until I wish to use it?</font></b></li><p>
Yes.....parking to our servers is free.  <p>
<li><b><font COLOR=#000000>If I take a hosting package from you, does it include telephone charges, dial up access, domain name, website design, etc.?</font></b></li><p>
No, by hosting your site on our servers, we only provide space for you to place your files, and access to those files by anybody requesting them over the internet. <p>
<li><b><font COLOR=#000000>What else will I need?</font></b></li><p>
To make your own website available to the internet, you will need:-<br>
<blockquote><p>Your own domain name. You can get away without this if you use some of the "free" webspace provided by any of the dozens of free dial up ISPs, the main snag is that your site has to be called something like:-<br>
internationalglobalbanking.freeserve.co.uk<br>
which isn't going to impress your friends and customers much.<br></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Some way of writing in HTML, you can use word-processors or a specialised HTML editor, unless you get someone else to design it for you. In the spirit of KIS (Keep It Simple), we recommend <a HREF="http://www.arachnoid.com/arachnophilia/">Arachnophilia</a>. It won't cost you a penny, and save you years trying to learn "Front Page".</blockquote><p>
You will need a way to upload your completed pages (files) to the server. This is done using an FTP (File Transfer Programme). One of the most popular is Cute FTP, which costs about £35, and can be tried out before you buy it.<br clear=all>
You will obviously need a computer and a modem (V90 preferred), ISDN or T3 cable connection would be even better.<br clear=all>
A dial-up account with an ISP. We do not provide this. It is not included in any of our packages. You can use any ISP you like, most of the free ones are OK.<p><br clear=all>

<li><b><font COLOR=#000000>Reasons for Wanting Your Own Domain Name</font></b></li><br>
<blockquote><p>If you intend to advertise your own business on the internet, it will create a better impression.
It's easy for you and your customers and friends to remember. For example to telling someone to look at your new website at:-<br>
<a HREF="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~chard01/">www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~chard01</a><br>
assuming you can remember it yourself!, isn't it easier to say:<br>
<a HREF="http://www.24carat.co.uk/">www.24carat.co.uk</a>?<br></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
You have already got a Bentley Turbo, a gold Rolex, and a personal registration plate.</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>You might be able to sell it for a fat profit. This is a strong possibility. A client recently asked us if we could get them a domain name which had been registered but parked, that is not used, we found the owner, and put him in touch. The asking price was $30,000 = about £19,000! The asking price for some names is well in 6 digits. We predict that the asking price of the best names will rocket when everybody wakes up to the potential of the internet. </blockquote><p>
<br clear=all><p><LI><b><font COLOR=#000000>How can we do it for £23.50 per year when Nominet charge £80 plus VAT?</font></b><P>It's very simple.  As members of Nominet we get a discount - we pass this on to our clients.  We are happy to work on a smaller profit margin than our competitors and expect a higher volume of registrations.<br>Some other agencies charge fees of up to £100 plus VAT in addition to the stated £80 "Nominet" charge.<br>We are pleased to offer the domain names at <font COLOR=#000000>£47 every two years</font> and hope it will highlight the special offer we can make on hosting the domain also.<br>As we keep saying, though, there is really no obligation to host your domain name with us.  Just let us know where to point it and we'll update the server at Nominet with the information it needs.</li><p><LI><b><font COLOR=#000000>Is the domain name mine?</font></b><P>Yes.  The domain name will be registered in your name.  Our fees of £47.00 include two years payment of Nominet fees.</li><p><p><LI><b><font COLOR=#000000>What name can I have?</font></b><P>You can make up any name you wish as long as it only contains the 26 letters of the alphabet, numbers 0-9 and a - (dash).  <br clear=all><table cellpadding="5" width="100%"><tr><td>So for example: <li>johnsmith.co.uk</li><li>1stchoice.co.uk</li><li>metropole-hotel.co.uk</li></td><td><p>are all acceptable</td></tr><tr><td><p>But:<br><li>marks&spencers.co.uk</li><li>£100.co.uk</li></td><td><br clear=all><p>are not</li><p></td></tr></table><p><LI><b><font COLOR=#000000>Why get a domain name?</font></b><P>Well its got more prestige.  It could be an extension of the marketing of your business.  In a few years time it will be the MAJOR marketing of your business.<br>If you don't snap the name up quickly chances are somebody may beat you to it.  It also could also be an investment.<br>We believe the internet is going to boom in Great Britain over the next ten years.  <br>Our domain name of &nbsp;your-name-here.co.uk&nbsp; actually cost us more than we charge you for yours - £50<br>We wouldn't sell it today for <font COLOR=#ff0000>£5,000.</font><br>We probably wouldn't for <font COLOR=#008000>£50,000</font>&nbsp; <B><FONT COLOR=#ff0000><B>UPDATE</B></FONT> - We definately wouldn't</B><br>We'd be seriously tempted for <font COLOR=#0000ff>£500,000</font> - ok we'd snatch your hand off but do you get the drift<p><LI><b><font COLOR=#000000>How do I transfer files to my website?</font></b><P>Files must be transferred to the web server via File Transfer Protocol (FTP). If you need FTP, telnet, mail, or other Internet software, visit <a HREF="http://www.shareware.com">Shareware.com</a>. Shareware.com is a source for the latest Internet applications with ratings and reviews to help you decide which application is best suited for your needs. An FTP tutorial is also available for beginner users who may not be familiar with FTP.</li><p><LI><b><font COLOR=#000000>What is a virtual domain?</font></b><P>A Virtual Domain means having your own domain name (http://www.your-name-here.co.uk) without having to install expensive server hardware and software. With a Virtual Domain, you utilize our server's storage space, however, you are still professionally represented via your own personal Internet web address domain name (www.your-name-here.co.uk) and by your own personal e-mail address domain name (you@your-name-here.co.uk).</li>

<p><LI> <b><font COLOR=#000000>Whats this yourname.www1.co.uk business all about?</font></b><P>OK....we can also supply anyname you want to go with our 2nd level domain name of www1.co.uk if the name that you really wanted has already gone.  So if you wanted virgin.co.uk and Mr Branson won't sell it to you - you could have an alternative with us of http://virgin.www1.co.uk<BR>
The name could be literally anythingyouwant.www1.co.uk<BR>
As its a third level domain name there are NO registration fees<BR>All you pay for is the hosting - we give you the name free for as long as you want us to host it.<BR></li>

As such, you can create and maintain your web pages on your own computer and upload files to your web site at your leisure.</li><p><LI><b><font COLOR=#000000>Can I use my account for commercial purposes?</font></b><P>Yes, you can use your account for commercial purposes. The World Wide Web has become the most efficient and cost-effective means of making information available to the users of the Internet community and we encourage our customers to utilize such an enormous medium.</li><p><LI><b><font COLOR=#000000>How long does it take to setup a new account?</font></b><P>New accounts are generally set up within 24 hours from the time we receive your order.

All Internet providers must update their records (DNS tables) to reflect the new site's location.  You don't have to do anything - we take care of this for you.</li><p> <LI> <b><font COLOR=#000000>Can I pay by credit card?</font></b><P><A HREF="https://roc.safe-order.net/your-name-here/order/index.html">You can - we now have Merchant Status</A></li><br></td></tr></table><br clear=all><br clear=all><p><div align="center"><a HREF="index.html">Home</a> | <a HREF="search.html">Domain Search</a> | <a HREF="hosting.html">Domain Hosting</a> | <a HREF="domainmoving.html">Domain Moving</a> | <a HREF="order.html">Order</a> | <a HREF="design.html">Web Design</a> | <a HREF="contact.html">Contact Us</a> | <a HREF="paymentoptions.html">Payment details</a></div><br clear=all><br clear=all><br clear=all><p></BODY></HTML>
