<B>Things I Wish I'd Known!</B>
<P>
We set up our website <A HREF="http://www.24carat.co.uk/">www.24carat.co.uk</A> only in November 1999.
It has already greatly changed our business for the better!, but there are
many things I wish we had known before.
<P>
Right from the first week, we started receiving enquiries about coins and
jewellery not just from the UK, but from all parts of the world. It took
about 2 months, though, before we made our first sale via our website.
Shortly after that we made the second sale, and since then the frequency
and volume of our internet sales has been steadily increasing.
<P>
For about 3 years beforehand, I believed that we should be on the
internet. The usual pressures, mainly time, stopped us from getting into
it earlier, and yet as each day ticked away, I knew we should be on the
web.
<P>
During 1998, I spent several months getting familiar with how to use the
internet, what could be found on it. The more I looked, the more urgently
I realised that our business had to be part of it. In about June, I
received a phone call from a close relation telling me that he was making
a major change to his business, and was moving into website design. "Would
I", he wanted to know, "like to be a guinea pig, a test customer for his
design work?" When he phoned me I had been sitting at my computer
wondering who I could get to either design a site for us or to show me how
to go about designing my own. It took me about one millisecond to say
"Yes!" We then started planning a structure for the site, and had weekly,
almost daily, phone calls about it. Within a few weeks, we had a front
page in place, but then... ...not a lot. My relation was busy trying to
move house, and several months went by, until one day...
<P>
Searching the internet for stuff about Blackpool, I came across "<A HREF="http://www.fyldecoast.co.uk/">Blackpool
& Fylde Coast Internet Magazine</A>", a very well designed and professional
looking website with lots of interesting material about Blackpool,
Cleveleys, trams, and all the other attractions of the Fylde Coast. It
offered free classified advertising for local residents! Never being one
to miss a bargain, I e-mailed a brief advert for our gold jewellery.
Within a few minute I received an e-mail reply from Doug Smith, the editor
of B&FCIM, and old acquaintance. He asked for some more details for our
advert, and within an hour, we had the electronic equivalent of a full
page colour advert on the web. For free! Unbelievable!
<P>
I was so impressed with the whole thing, that I told Doug about my ideas
for our own website, and the lack of progress. In less than an hour, he
came back with comments about the design, and quite a few positive
suggestions, so that it wasn't long before it became obvious that Doug was
the right person to help with our site. The only problem with a project
like this is that we were both aware of the potentially infinite nature of
the project. Doug solved this problem neatly by offering to create the
basic site design, and add a good number of pages, so that we had a
working site, and then at any time I could take over the design and
further implementation, Doug said once the job was complete, I could pay
him what I thought it was worth. I replied that surely he couldn't afford
to work for that kind of money! We shook hands on the arrangement.
<P>
It took only a few weeks for the site to come alive, with pages about gold
sovereigns, rare numismatic collectors coins, diamond rings, gold
jewellery, humour, guestbook, information sections, feedback forms. It
would take me a day to write the "copy", and within hours Doug would have
them designed, on site and uploaded, with an e-mail to me asking me to
check and "proof read" it.
<P>
Over these few weeks, I watched Doug write the HTML code for some of our
pages, adding and manipulating graphics, and I was amazed at how easy he
made it look.
<P>
Our site now contains close to 1000 pages, and over 1000 images! It has
been so successful for us that we have recently had to work 12 hour days
just to keep up with our e-mail sales enquiries! Indeed, we have since
started several more websites, with the intention of splitting up our
original site into smaller sites, each specialising in one aspect of our
business.
<P>
The title of this article was <B>"Things I wish I'd known"</B>. So far I have
only related briefly our delight at the success of our site. This brings
us back to the point. The things I wish I had known:-
<BR clear=all>
1)&nbsp;&nbsp;How successful the internet would be for us.<BR>
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;That Doug Smith (Snoop) could have a site designed, up and running,
in almost no time at all.<BR>
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;How easy it is to write web pages.<BR>
4)&nbsp;&nbsp;About the book <FONT COLOR=#ff0000>"SAMS Teach Yourself HTML in 24 Hours"</FONT>.<BR>
A year ago, I hunted round for a good book about website design and HTML (Hyper Text
Mark-up Language), and failed to find one! Recently I came across this
book. Even though I have now created over 900 web pages, this book has
been very useful. It is written in a simple, good style, and contains
great advice for both beginners and experts. A lot of web design
professionals should read it!
<P>
At this point I have an admission to make. Like Victor Kyam, the
American entrepreneur who famously said that he liked the product,
Remington Razors, so much that he bought the company, Doug and I went on
to form a business to help others set up, design and run their own
websites. It is of course called "Your-Name-Here". I have to admit that
Doug does most of the hard work, I still find it incredible how patiently
he answers FAQ's and provides very practical support for web hosting
clients. I reckon although we don't offer 24 hour 7 day support, the
support we give our clients is better than you would get from major
internet hosting companies who would charge up to 10 times our price!<BR clear=all><P>
