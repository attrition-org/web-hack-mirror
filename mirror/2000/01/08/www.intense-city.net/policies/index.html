any reason.&nbsp;

grounds for immediate account deactivation.&nbsp;

another customer's Web presence is strictly prohibited. Any violation of
the above terms or conditions will result in grounds for account termination.
We will be the sole arbiter as to what constitutes a violation of this
provision.
