<br>
Another hosting company falls to the notorious secto0r. What's up with all these 'hackers' who seem cool enough until I start to discuss an exploit i'm coding or something. They seem to be at a loss for words. The media and other clueless onlookers need to know the difference between us. Anyone can ./hack a server. Most of these kids don't even know why these exploits work. It's time to set the record straight.<br>
<br>
So many hosting companies falling, wonder why? These companies spend large amounts of money on dedicated lines, servers, routers, etc. Yet they take no time to really take a hard look at security. Half of these companies leave credit card numbers wide open in text files for kiddies to grab. You're lucky that i'm not that way. Over the past few days I have looked at thousands of credit card numbers, not writing one down. You people need to wake up. You have a responsibility to your customers to be secure. What kind of message does this hack portray? One that needs to be shouted by all people out there keeping it real..<br><br>
Word up to all my nigguhs keeping it real these days. Including all the regulars of
#crontab on dalnet. Especially my nigguh BlazinWeed. Mad respect and love goes out to herf, morbid, cybernetix, hacktic, f0bic, and NtWaK0.<br>
