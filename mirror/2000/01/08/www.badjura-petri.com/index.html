    href="http://www.healdsburg.net">www.badjura-petri.com</a> - I got some interesting mail
    in the last few days that I want to share with You. The first one is from a Security
    Consultant David Hove, who works for a company named &quot;RISCmanagment Inc.&quot; (</font><font
    color="blue" face="Verdana"><a href="http://www.riscman.com">www.riscman.com</a></font><font
    face="Verdana">), and this is what he wrote to me in his mail :</font></small><p><small><font
    face="Verdana">------</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Numb Nuts, </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Your judgments lay upon broken young souls who know no
    better. Let it be! Hackers will hack regardless of holes previously exploited. If the sys
    adm does not fix their holes this is not the issue. Hacking for fame is not the issue. You
    yourself mailed your hack in for recognition did you not. STOP THE HYPOCRISY AND SIMPLY
    HACK. Who the hell are U to dictate what should be placed on a defaced website? I
    personally work the other side of the fence specializing in keeping you out but thoroughly
    enjoy watching you and others like you go about your daily routine. Exploiting port 80,
    buffer overflows, running your little scripts, ect. Fuck ethics! The harder you try to
    hack the more aware we become as admins. For those admins who do not keep up Fuckem! </font></small></p>

    </font><p>-------</p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana"><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deer Mr. David, your email made me very sad because I
    realized that people don't get the message I'm trying to say. Hacking previously hacked
    sites is considered lame, and yes, hacking for fame is the issue. Hackers now adays hack
    only to get media attention. In my country a 16 year old Back Orifice user was raided for
    &quot;hacking&quot; a computer of a Croatian politian. The media made a national hero out
    of him. In the interview he said that he could hack into a bank with just two of his
    friends and a good computer. Now, people who read that newspaper bought the story, but
    people who know young Denis via IRC can confirm that he is a complete idiot an a lamer.
    His parents are so proud of him, not knowing that anyone can &quot;hack&quot; using Back
    Orifice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About me mailing my hack to
    attrition. Yes, I did mail the hack to attrition, you know why !? I deface to spread the
    message out. I personally think if I just deface the site that people wont notice it. So I
    report it to attrition and they put a mirror of the site I defaced so other people can
    view it too. I don't do it for the fame. I could hack under a different name everytime,
    but this is my style. I don't got braging on IRC &quot;I hacked this..&quot;, &quot;I
    hacked that..&quot;. I don't have to prove my skillz to anyone. People can respect me or
    hate me. I sincerely doubt that defacing a site will make me look better infront of my
    friends. Almost anyone can find himself a remote exploit and run it against the server.
    But not anyone can secure a Unix server, program or even make html. For me defacing
    is&nbsp;just expressing my opinion on stuff, nothing more.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 'fuck the ethics'
    thing. Mr. David, the ethics are here to prevent a major chaos. Without ethics people
    would just go around and delete anything they run into. I suggest every hacker to stick to
    the ethics as close as he can, hell, that's why they were written. I know people forget
    about them, but there are always people like me to remind hackers about the ethics. That's
    the balance. People don't stick to them, they life stupid messages like &quot;I 0wn3
    j00&quot;. I tell You people, that's bad. Can't You just write something. Anything, just
    not these stupid irritating messages. Ok, we started another discussion here. &quot;Who
    the hell are U to dictate what should be placed on a defaced website?&quot; - You say.
    Well, Your right. I'm nobody. I can't dictate what should be placed on a defaced website.
    But I can suggest people not to do it. I just suggested it, I didn't dictate or order it.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The harder you try to
    hack the more aware we become as admins.&quot; - Aware ?! If I deface Your site ten times,
    and don't tell You how I got in, You become more aware !? I damage Your company for 10.000
    $ by defacing it, because people say: &quot;How can they secure my server when they can't
    even secure their own.&quot; And nobody wants Your service anymore. Don't get me wrong.
    I'm sure You're a very good and experienced administrator, but nothing is secure enough,
    that hackers can't brake it. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's what we devoted Our
    lives to, penetrating systems. I enjoy hacking. That is really something unique. People
    through ages have always wanted to do something that's forbidden or illegal. Just remind
    Yourself of Adam &amp; Eve, and the Heaven garden. Eve had to eat that apple alldo God
    gave them everything they needed, and just forbid them to eat apples from that tree.
    Hacking is illegal in many countries. You could get worse sentence for hacking than for
    murdering someone.&nbsp; I don't really care if I get raided.&nbsp; Hacking is my crime. A
    crime out of passion. Respect me or hate me, the choice is Yours.</font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
