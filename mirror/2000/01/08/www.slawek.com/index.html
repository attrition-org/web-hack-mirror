<br>Ok this is getting rather boring now so i'll take this opportunity
to say something worthwhile. First let me address the script kiddies .....
<p>first of all defacing web sites is not clever and doesn't prove shit
about your technical ability,&nbsp; hell I could train a monkey to do this
all night and get away without leaving a trace. So stop msging me on IRC
asking *how* because i'll just tell you to fuck off&nbsp; and grow a brain.
<br>Hacking is not something you can be taught you either got it or you
don't , not that I even consider this hacking. So kiddies please go away
and learn how to use a computer before you queue up to ask&nbsp; how to
deface retarded webites.
<br>And that goes to you Unix kiddies who think your leet because you can
root a server by typing ./hack.
