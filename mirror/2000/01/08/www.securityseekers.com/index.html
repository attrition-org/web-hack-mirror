                    Hrm. Protesting is fun. Where to start.

Note: This is not a demonstration against the US Government. 
I am satisfyed in most ways with the US Government, except for the laws against *MOST* illegal drugs.
It should be considered a first amendment right. Stuff like Marijuana should be
legalized. It is NOT even close to being as bad as tobacco products. The fact is,
no one has ever died from OD'ing on Marijuana, got cancer from it, had any heart defects
directly caused by it, and etcetera. There are only 2 ways possible for someone to die
from it is to smoke so much that it makes them mentally defective, and it kills
most of their brain (Frontal Lobes, and work backwards from THC saturation), and
shuts down their nervous system and so on. But that would take immense ammounts of
THC (like, pounds of it) and no one would be able to do it. The other way is for
someone to operate heavy machinery (Cars, Forklifts, Etcetera), and get in a accident
of some sort. But then again, you can have SURGEON WARNING LABELS LIKE YOU HAVE ON
FREAKIN ALCOHOL BOTTLES. BAH!

FDA Already legalized it for medical purposes. They have seen that some NATURALLY
OCCURING PRODUCTS IN IT can CURE CANCER (like LUNG CANCER FROM CIGARETTES),
correct EYESIGHT IN SOME FORMS, and so on. Does the FDA say anything about that with
TOBACCO or ALCOHOL (sans Red Wine, which helps the heart). NO! Again, it's lobbyists
paying your asses off. Sad world we live in these days.
