<br>Here to say that the OHB sucks. To me, they are a disgrace to all the Brazilians. They bring their reputation down by defacing with FP, re-defacing other peoples defacements that were already lame because of their use of FP and re-defacing even their OWN defacements with no new statement but some arrogant talk only so many people can read.
<br>I believe in Brazil, and therefore I would like to ask the OHB to stop defacing with FP because that's just so lame.
<br><br>
Also, this is an FP defacement, so you as the OHB can reply, I hope in a decent READABLE manner (like english, because there are more people who know english then portugese.)
