For a while it did – particularly for Gay men in the States – but long-term it has failed. Quite what has failed is debatable: the message, as always, about condoms and safer sex, has changed little. Maybe that's part of the problem. Maybe men and women think they know it all. After all, apart from the odd bit of unsubstantiated paranoia about oral sex, little has changed in terms of the information we give out since the late 1980's. But what seems to have failed us, all of us, most of all is the WAY we tell people about these things.</TD>

For us that means men and women and the common cause – I sincerely hope – is the prevention of the spread of HIV. The problem is that even that common cause is being challenged by the so-called return of unsafe sex – or slippage" as it is sometimes called. My feeling is that it has been there all along – it's just that people didn't talk about it. And now, slowly, it might just be becoming possible to do so – to admit that actually safer sex is bloody hard work and that it DOESN'T come naturally (if you'll excuse the pun).<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>HIS is what our health education initiatives need to be based on – reality, not some well-meaning belief that just because condoms are relatively accessible to an increasing number of people, that people are actually USING them. There are far too many reasons why they may well NOT be using them and it is talking about those reasons that matters. And we need to talk about them at a level that makes connections with the reality of those people's sex lives – and, for that matter, their lives as a whole – so that somewhere along the line meaningful connections are made and the beginnings of potential behaviour change can be made possible.</TD>

The SAIMDC describes a doctor's duty to keep information confidential: &quot;(no practitioner may) divulge verbally or in writing any information which ought not to be divulged regarding the ailments of a patient except with the express consent of the patient or in the case of a minor, with the express consent of the guardian, or in the case of a deceased patient, with the consent of the next of kin or the executor of his estate. [ Rule 16 of SAIMDC's Rules of Practise]. Despite the guarantee of confidentiality that this clause offers, it is cases such as&nbsp; the McGeary case (where the patient's HIV status was disclosed by his doctor to a&nbsp; dentist on the golf course) that cause patients to doubt the reality of this confidentiality.</P>

This confession is often accompanied by embarrassment and the expression of guilty feelings. The level of anxiety related to the fear of contracting HIV is quite often out of proportion to the reality of the level of risk involved. An example of this would be the man who refused to accept assurances that masturbating in the presence of a sex worker was not a high risk activity. The fear of HIV appears to be linked to the degree of guilt felt towards the activity.</P>

Inability to concentrate, sleep disturbance and constant preoccupation with a possible positive result are some common issues mentioned by clients. Often the client will describe symptoms of full blown AIDS e.g. Night sweats, persistent dry cough, weight loss, diarrhoea, fatigue, swollen glands. As these symptoms are so vague and can describe a multitude of illnesses, it can be hard for the client&nbsp; to believe that he is not HIV positive. </P>

<P>Joe is getting married in a weeks time and his friends have arranged a party and also arranged for a stripper. As most of these parties go hand in hand with a lot of alcohol consumption, Joe has a reputation to live up to and a lot of pressure is also applied by his friends.
