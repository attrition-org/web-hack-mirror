<P><B>Are condoms effective against AIDS?<BR></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When properly used, condoms create a strong protective barrier to the spread of many sexually transmitted diseases (STD's). Early in the AIDS epidemic, scientists theorised that condoms would help prevent AIDS because the virus that causes the disease is roughly the size of herpes and other viruses which are unable to penetrate latex: further, neither air nor water can pass through condoms even though their molecules are a 1,000 times smaller than such viruses. In 1985, a rigorous laboratory study demonstrated that AIDS virus could not go through condoms. Throughout the 80's and 90's both clinical and human studies of condom effectiveness have continued to reach the same heartening conclusions. Further continuing studies of people at high risk for HIV infection who use condoms regularly are confirming these findings. Sexologists and others in the AIDS prevention field are more convinced than ever that condoms have an extremely important role in preventing the spread of AIDS.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Condoms also prevent the transmission of most STD's and several of the opportunistic infections or co-factors of HIV / AIDS. For example, they help stop genital transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes, chancroid, gonorrhoea and syphilis.&nbsp;<BR><BR><B>How to use condoms correctly<BR></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice makes perfect!! Instructions for condom use are simple but must be followed carefully. The main reason condoms fail is incorrect use. They seldom leak or break due to faulty manufacture.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep a convenient supply of condoms in a cool, dry&nbsp;&nbsp; place for &quot;every time&quot; use.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not test condoms by inflating or stretching them.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use condoms EVERY time you have intercourse, even for oral sex!<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the package carefully. Rough handling can damage condoms, especially if nails are long or jagged.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gently press any air out of the receptacle tip at the closed end before putting on the condom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plain-ended condoms require about a half inch free at the tip to catch ejaculation. In fact, leaving extra latex at the end of the condom and adding a dab of lubricant in the tip will solve the air problem and greatly increase sensation.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unroll the condom so that it covers the entire penis. To increase sensation when a man is uncircumcised, the foreskin should be pulled back before covering the head with the condom. Fitting an erect penis with a condom down to the base as the organ hardens. If the condom does not fit completely to the bottom of a man's penis, he should be careful not to insert beyond the condom base as this can cause the condom to come off. Pushing back the pubic hair at the base of the penis will help keep it from getting tangled in the condom.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use plenty of water-soluble lubricant on the outside of&nbsp; the condom and on the vagina or anus before entry. Areas that are too dry can pull condoms off and tear them as well. Oil-based lubricants like baby-oil, cold creams, vaseline, cause condoms to quickly break. Some topical medications and vaginal moistening creams contain oil. Watch out for these and use plastic condoms if you are unsure.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold onto the base of the condom when necessary so the condom won't slip off. If the penis is getting soft, or if a partner is very tight, the condom may tend to slip. Certain sexual positions also tend to cause slipping. For example when a woman is sitting on top of a man, the lips of her&nbsp; vagina can lift off the condom. Holding the base of the condom will solve the problem.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After ejaculation, hold onto the condom around the base to avoid spilling the contents or losing the condom inside a&nbsp; partner. Withdraw gently.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throw used condoms away! They should not be used more than once. NEVER go from one person to another without changing condoms.<BR><BR><B>Picking the condom that's right for you<BR></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When looking for the &quot;right&quot; condom the main thing to do is experiment!!! Try out lots of different kinds using low risk activities such as masturbation, and rubbing between the thighs or breasts. Be sure to break some so you know how much stress they can take and what it feels like when one is torn.<BR><BR><B>Latex, natural or plastic condoms?<BR></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although some users prefer condoms made from the appendix of sheep, latex and plastic condoms provide better protection. The animal fibre condoms have walls of unequal thickness and sometimes leak. It's much better to use good latex condoms. Penis condoms made of plastic are still being developed and hold much promise, for plastic conducts heat better than latex and can be made with a wide variety of texture and elasticity. This promises greatly increased pleasure. The Reality (female or internal) condom is on the market and a great favourite of many people. It can be used in the vagina or in the anus.<BR><BR><B>Wet or dry?<BR></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lubricated condoms do not break as easily as unlubricated ones. They also give a moist natural sexual feeling to the skin that the dry powered ones do not. This creates greater sensation for the wearer.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Condoms are lubricated with gels or silicone based products. Gel coat prophylactics unevenly inside the package, while silicone products lubricate all parts of the condom equally. The silicone coating is less likely to break from grabbing on dry spots during use.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some condoms are lubricated with nonoxynol-9, a substance which kills AIDS virus in test tube studies. These are advertised as having a spermicidal lubricant. Important considerations in choosing to use such condoms are:<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They may provide a minimum of local protection against&nbsp;&nbsp; HIV in case the condom breaks, leaks or spills.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonoxynol-9 lubricated condoms have only been tested for vaginal intercourse and tests were not rigorous. Accordingly, some using them for anal intercourse may wish&nbsp;&nbsp; to put the condom on and wipe off the outside so as to have added protection on the inside of the condom without using<BR>it on anal tissue.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people find nonoxynol-9 mildly irritating. Nonoxynol-9 products should be tried out first, using low risk activities before taking a chance on becoming chapped and creating a possible route for infection. Problems with irritation can usually be solved by simply changing spermicidal brands. For that matter, the amount of nonoxynol-9 lubricant on these condoms is so minimal that irritation is generally.<BR><BR><B>Should they fit like a glove?<BR></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With condoms, exact size isn't everything! Latex hugs and stretches to fit many sizes. Condoms which fit snugly slightly constrict the superficial veins of the penis making<BR>erections harder and orgasms more intense. Sex therapists often suggest this approach to men who are having trouble maintaining an erection during sex. Condoms with more room<BR>at the top allow the end of the condom to move and thus create more sensation. Length is not critical so long as the condom goes all the way to the base of the penis and people are careful during intercourse not to penetrate beyond the condom ends. Shop around with fun as well as safety in mind.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people have tremendous fear that condoms will come off during sex. Further, because of the variety in penis shapes and sizes a few men do have a serious problem finding a condom brand which will stay on well. There is an excellent brand of condoms on the market, Mentor Contraceptives, which has an adhesive on the inside that seals to the skin. Sometimes referred to as &quot;synthetic skin&quot; this particular condom has the ability to shrink or stretch if a man's penis becomes softer or harder during sex while staying firmly in place. Occasionally, the condom will be gripped by the vaginal or rectal muscles and the penis will move in and out of the condom. This can feel good but runs the risk of losing the condom. When the condom begins to slip, use your hand to &quot;get a grip&quot;.<BR><BR><B>Is thicker stronger?<BR></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some condoms are thicker than others but modern production techniques have led to condoms of reduced thickness without sacrificing essential strength required by federal standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More important than thickness for strength is the age of the condom and the way it is treated before and after use. Condoms have a shelf life of 5 years under the optimal conditions, but begin to deteriorate slowly after 2 &frac12; years. Buy from a distributor who has a good turnover. Condoms also age quickly from heat, strong light and rough treatment. Don't leave them in the sun or keep them in your car glove compartment and don't keep them in your wallet for a long period. Packages made of foil or opaque plastic protect condoms much better than ones that have &quot;see through&quot; covers.<BR><BR><B>What about different shapes?<BR></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Condoms with receptacle tips to catch the ejaculate are recommended over rounded ends, but both are fine.Condoms which have a mushroom top provide more sensation to the head of the penis by allowing it freedom of movement. For larger glans, these are also more comfortable.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ribbed condoms have little nobbies on the outside which provide more sensation to the condom wearer's partner. Some like this, others find it irritating. Try switching from ribbed to unribbed if your partner has had enough extra stimulation.<BR><BR><B>Colours, tastes and smells</B>.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People occasionally object at first to the taste or smell of latex, but after a few experiences with condoms and enjoyable sex most people find the taste and smell of latex an erotic turn on. Latex itself actually has very little taste. It is the additives that make condom brands distinct.<BR>Some silicone lubricated condoms actually have less taste than many unlubricated condoms.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be careful about condoms which are scented as the perfume can cause allergies. There is considerable variety in the taste and smell of condom lubricants so pick what you like best.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonoxynol-9 can make the mouth and gums feel numb, or sometimes have a bitter taste. Flavoured condoms are good for oral sex, but not advised for penetrative sex.<BR><BR><B>How can a person learn to enjoy condoms?<BR></B>&nbsp;&nbsp; First, experiment all you want. If you are clumsy, don't sweat it. If you make a mess, open another one and start over again. If the going is easy, that's fine too,<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep several types and sizes around so that you and /or your partner(s) will have a choice.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put your favourite fantasy partners into condom scenes while you masturbate. Think up ways you might get the partners to use condoms and what it would be like.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't make condoms feel the exact sane way as naked skin. But you can explore the sensations of latex. Once you do this, condoms often become extremely enjoyable – more&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like sexual enhancers than devices for sexual hygiene.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a thousand ways to make putting on condoms an exciting part of sex instead of an interruption.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men often make the mistake of thinking that once they've put a condom on they have to ejaculate or else. This is a sure way not to enjoy condoms. Use as many condoms during sex as you like.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Condoms cut down on friction and make some guys last longer before ejaculating. This is a wonderful feature of latex for lots of men (and women) but a problem for others. If you or your partner don't want to make sex last longer, use other low risk options until you're close to ejaculation and then put on a condom. In fact, do this as many times as you want.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use additional water-soluble lubricant. The lubrication on condoms helps but usually is not enough. As pointed out above, you can heighten enjoyment by pouring just a little bit of lubricant into the reservoir tip before putting a condom on. This helps keep air out of the tip and greatly<BR>&nbsp; increases sensation when the lubricant seeps around the glans. It takes a little practice to get the right amount down, but it is well worth the effort!!<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the best water-soluble lubricants dry out during use. But if you wet them again, they're as good as new.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the above suggestions, ask other people who use condoms how they have learned to enjoy them the most.<BR><BR><B>How to tell them you want to use a condom</B>.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When possible, communicate with partners about your desire to use condoms before you start having sex. Make it an extension of your usual sex play so that things go smoothly. Let yourself be creative! Thinking up new ways to incorporate condoms into your love life can be fun and very sexy. Talking about condoms is extremely helpful and becomes easy with practice. Be honest about your feelings. If you are nervous, embarrassed and inexperienced, say so!! It gives you room to experiment and lets the other person be honest too. If you are excited by condoms, say that too. It gives your partner a chance to explore, share tales of latex delight or deal with negative feelings, doubts and fears before you're in the middle of sex.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-verbal communication is easier or more fun for some people. You might put condoms near the place you have sex and have a copy of this book handy. Or you could simply pull<BR>one out and put it on when the right time comes around. As with other non-verbal sexual communication, it's pretty easy to tell if the other person is turned on or off. If turned on, go ahead. If turned off, you can usually smooth things out by laying the condom aside and continuing with low risk activities.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people find that being very direct is the best way to approach condom use. You might say, &quot;I use condoms, how about you?&quot; Some people love this kind of talk and others hate it. Make your approach fit your style and the occasion.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a partner refuses to use condoms, don't fight it – do things that are low risk or let them go. Nobody is so great that they are &quot;to die for, doll!!&quot;<BR><BR><B>When condoms don't work and what to do about it!!<BR></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major reason condoms fail to prevent disease is that people use them part of the time. Wear them every time! Researchers state that the most common reasons people give for not wearing condoms are:<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They think a partner is not infected.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They don't think condoms really work.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They forget to carry them.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are too embarrassed to bring the subject up-afraid a partner will be offended.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are too drunk or high on drugs to remember, or even unable to put their condoms on.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are too small / too big.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Urban legends around condoms, include it is a government plot to stop people from having more children.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AIDS don't exist.<BR><BR>&nbsp; Don't let this happen to you!! If you're going to use penetration during sex, be prepared, willing and able to use a condom.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second most important reason condoms don't prevent disease is they leak and break. Sometimes a condom is poorly manufactured. More often, they leak or break, because they<BR>are old, have been exposed to strong sunlight, heat or extreme cold. But the most common reasons are rough treatment and oil based lubricants.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember: Never use oil-based lubricants on latex. They gum up condoms, make them brittle and cause them to dissolve quickly.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you masturbate a condom-clad penis hard during foreplay, stretch the receptacle tip or twang it on the urethra, be sure to put on a new condom before penetration sex, because even if the condoms seems okay you may have weakened it.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a condom breaks during intercourse, stop, urinate, clean up well and use a new condom. If ejaculation has occurred, partners should not douche as this can create small tears and spread possible infection. Consider immediately inserting a spermicide with 3% or more nonoxynol-9.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordinary condoms only cover the penis and therefore only protect the organ and what it touches. The Reality condom covers a greater area and therefore is better for prevention. Unfortunately this is not enough protection against HIV or most other sexually transmitted infections because infected body fluids which get into cuts, abrasions, ingrown hairs, pimples, bleeding gums or broken skin may spread the disease. Be sure to check out yourself and your<BR>partner to avoid unnecessary risks. Consider putting band- aids over small problem areas as partial protection and a gentle reminder during sex. Also consider lubricants with nonoxynol-9 for problem areas not covered by a condom.<BR><BR><B>&nbsp;Other latex products<BR></B>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diaphragms. A diaphragm is a cup shaped device which covers a women's cervix. While the diaphragm by itself is not a complete barrier against infection, it is an important addition to the safe sex arsenal. The first step is to make sure that the diaphragm fits correctly. The diaphragm which<BR>holds the nonoxynol-9 cream or jelly, blocks the cervix (the neck of the uterus that projects into the vagina). By&nbsp; blocking the cervix the virus is unable to gain entry into the uterus which is easily accessible to the blood supply.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Latex and plastic examination gloves are superb for ass play, clitoral and vaginal stimulation, body massage and other delights. They come plain, powered or lubricated and in many different sizes, colours and tastes. Gloves can be bought individually at many pharmacies and can be obtained in quantity from almost all surgical supply stores without prescription.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rubber dams are squares of latex used by dentists to create a barrier to blood, saliva and germs during dental procedures. They are usually scented and make an excellent addition to any safe sex kit. Dams are available at many safe sex and adult sexually orientated stores and most<BR>dental supply stores.<BR><BR><B>Lubricants and Spermicides</B>.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can not be said enough times – The major reason condoms break is that they have been used with an oil-based lubricant!! Oil can be used for massage, salad dressings or lubricating cars, but it must not be used with latex condoms! Unlike the rubber in tyres which is hardened with<BR>sulphur to withstand heat and road conditions, the latex in condoms is &quot;soft cured&quot; to provide maximum elasticity and comfort. When oil is used on condoms, the latex quickly dissolves or become like crackly parchment.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many lubricants made for use with condoms. They are commonly found in, adult book stores and grocery stores. Some popular and easy to find brands are Slip, KY Jelly, ForPlay, Erogel, Prepair and AquaLube Plus (All stocked by DISA Health Care). Try out different brands to pick the one you like best.<BR><BR>Qualities to look out for:<BR><BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How well do they lubricate?<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long do they lubricate?<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do they affect your skin?<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the lubricant in a container which prevents spills or contamination during use?<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you like the smell and taste or does the lubricant have positive benefits which outweigh unpleasant features?<BR><BR><B>Spermicides and Nonoxynol-9<BR></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been known that the active ingredients of spermicides, primarily mild detergents, have antiseptic qualities. The most common agent is nonoxynol-9 (N-9). When used properly, this substance has been recognised as an important prophylactic aid against sexually transmitted<BR>diseases for over 25 years. The antiseptic nature of nonoxynol-9 was discovered when public health researchers noted that many STD-causing organisms are fragile and can be easily killed on contact with a wide variety of chemical agents. The researchers consequently set about studying<BR>common over-the-counter spermicides and &quot;feminine hygiene&quot; products to see if any of their ingredients would kill such pathogens. In laboratory tests, nonoxynol-9 and related detergents proved highly effective in destroying a wide variety of STD's on contact.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonoxynol-9 and its relatives work by bursting the outer protein cap of sperm and various disease organisms. In laboratory tests, they quickly and effectively killed herpes, gonorrhoea, syphilis, CMV, yeast and trichomonas. Most recently, nonoxynol-9 also has been found to kill AIDS virus in a test tube. Nonoxynol-9 kills HIV outside of cells at .05% but is essentially ineffective against HIV inside of cells until it reaches a 1% concentration. Most spermicides<BR>contain between 1% and 5%. It takes that much in a large enough quantity to make the necessary amount of N-9 available once it is mixed with body juices and spread over the vaginal walls. This is promising news, however nonoxynol-9 is considerably more effective under laboratory conditions than in actual sexual use because:<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inert ingredients in spermicides – foams, gels and creams – do not always spread evenly or form a sufficient chemical barrier for nonoxynol-9 to kill pathogens before they can reach uninfected tissue. People often use spermicides incorrectly and only when they &quot;think&quot; a partner is infected.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People abandon condoms instead of using nonoxynol-9 and condoms together.<BR><BR>It is very tempting to use nonoxynol-9 as a layer of prevention against AIDS while engaging in oral sex and anal intercourse, but make sure spermicides don't irritate you or your partner's genitals, mouth or rectum. When in doubt, check with your doctor. And to be sure the doctor is really<BR>up on the subject, be well informed yourself. There are conflicting studies of N-9 when used in the rectum. Some animal studies indicate that N-9 is safe for rectal use but others indicate it is dangerous. (See &quot;Reading up on condoms and spermicides&quot; at the end of the chapter).<BR><BR>Studies show that:<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spermicides provide a very important layer of&nbsp;&nbsp; protection from common STD transmission if used correctly and every time a person has intercourse (remember, the testing on spermicides and AIDS is incomplete). However, the effectiveness drops quickly when not used exactly as&nbsp; instructed on the label.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spermicides and condoms used together and correctly result in much greater disease prevention effectiveness than either technique alone.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonoxynol-9 has had a very good safety record for more than 45 years and has been used by gays in lubricating during anal intercourse over the last 10 years with almos no reports of problems. Animal studies of nonoxynol-9 excretion through the intestines showed no abnormalities.However, spermicides have only been tested for safe human use on the penis or in the vagina. The FDA noted in 1980 that spermicides are regularly swallowed during oral sex.<BR>&nbsp; Because of their extremely low toxicity and because nonoxynol-9 is used as a wetting agent in foods, The FDA deemed spermicides safe when swallowed in small quantities.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point not enough is known about the effect of nonoxynol-9 on human intestines (especially during sex) or about the AIDS virus to recommend spermicides totally<BR>&nbsp; without great reservation for anal sex or to recommend strongly against them! But they are certainly recommended for vaginal intercourse as a layer of AIDS prevention (provided a person is not sensitive to them – remember that changing brands usually takes care of this problem).<BR><BR>Research on Topical microbicides.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The various substances that kill STD's or inhibit disease transmission during sex are called &quot;topical microbicides&quot;. Unfortunately, this is one of the most neglected areas of prevention research. The development of antibiotics which easily cured STD's stunted the development of topical microbicides until recently when herpes and HIV made prevention once again a burning issue. Unfortunately, there is no FDA process for approving STD topical microbicides, only for spermicides which, as a secondary characteristic, kills STD's. If nonoxynol-9 were a completely effective form of prevention, the situation would not be so urgent. However, in addition to the information we have discussed above, the commercial grade of nonoxynol-9 used in most products contains impurities which are sometimes irritating and can damage cell membranes. As well, some researchers have raised the question of whether nonoxynol-9 or other mild detergents<BR>remove the mucosa from the vagina and rectum and thus leave it vulnerable to any virus not killed by common spermicides. The prevailing opinion among scientists is that a three to five percent N-9 spermicide can be used by most women four or five times a week without problems.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also questions about the most effective way to use nonoxynol-9 rectally. For example, to be effective, nonoxynol-9 should remain in the vagina for 4-5 hours after intercourse and women are advised not to douche. However, after anal intercourse, it is common to have a bowel movement. Must the nonoxynol-9 be reapplied in such cases? And how long must nonoxynol-9 remain in the bowel to be maximally effective? Is it irritating to be used at all rectally?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the need for further research on proper use of nonoxynol-9 products for AIDS prevention, it has become apparent in recent years that the inert ingredients of &quot;feminine hygiene&quot; products are almost as important in forming a barrier to infection as the active ingredients. An<BR>important 1979 overview of spermicides by researchers at the John Hopkins University found that the materials in the base can act as an extremely important physical barrier as well. No one has published research on the effects of various bases upon the AIDS virus.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, there are a few gels with nonoxynol-9 marketed as sexual lubricants for anal intercourse. Unfortunately they have been poorly tested for effectiveness. It may be that for anal use, because of the delicate membranes and the limited mucal secretions, a different combination of inert ingredients will be required. Considerable research is being conducted on bases at the<BR>time of this printing and hopefully better products will soon be on the market.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, the amount of nonoxynol-9 required to kill HIV depends in part upon the nature of the overall product. Those products which spread well and also create a physical barrier to transmission will not need as much detergents as today's gels.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly, nonoxynol-9 and its relatives are very important candidates for further research and development. However, researchers and health educators stress that there are many agents capable of killing HIV and other STD's on contact. Thus it might be that a foam, cream or gel with inert and antiseptic ingredients already approved and sold over the counter might be more effective against AIDS than any of the detergent products presently available. Some researchers feel that topical microbicides used in other countries should be made available in the US for example products which contain chlorhexadine and benzylkonium chloride. Others insist that new, better chemical agents must be developed and tested. Unfortunately, there is little government support for such a project and the need to protect patentable discoveries and trade secrets in the<BR>private sector makes the exchange of information and rapid progress almost impossible.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A general problem is that most research and new products are not sexologically sophisticated. Researchers ignore such factors as taste, smell and feel, yet these aspects of products seriously affect peoples' willingness to protect themselves. Also, researchers usually concentrate only on one sexual option – peno-vaginal intercourse. Since STD's are commonly transmitted through anal sex, oral sex and injured skin as well as coitus, vaginal products are not generally designed to provide the over-all protection people need to prevent HIV/STD transmission.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sexual lubricant industry which has grown out of safer sex movement is an exception to this bias for contraceptive technology. Taking a sex positive perspective, a few sexual lubricants aim to protect health while creating products which are sensuous, enjoyable and appealing.<BR>Lubricants with 1% nonoxynol-9 can be applied to provide protection to a much wider area of potential STD transmission than spermicides or condoms alone. As well, though condoms and lubricants should ALWAYS be used together, we know that millions of people continue to choose protective lubricants as their first defence during sex. This is because lubricants are already commonly sexually acceptable for most people: they decrease friction and increase sexual pleasure. It is tragic that in ignorance, people think that lubricating rectal and vaginal opening and<BR>putting lubrication on the penis is enough to provide protection during penetration sex. This is absolutely incorrect! To be effective, topical microbicides must coat all mucosal surfaces exposed to infection.<BR><BR><B>Other helpers</B>.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many other items which can easily create an effective barrier or kill HIV on contact. Some of these should not be placed on or in a person's body, but have a use in overall AIDS prevention.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diaper wipes often contain nonoxynol-9, alcohol and benzylkonium chloride (a substance which kills HIV). These wipes are excellent for cleaning up during and after sex.<BR>&nbsp; They are great for helping take off condoms! Read the ingredients and take your choice. Some have aloe vera in them to keep skin from drying out.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordinary soaps and detergents are very effective at killing the virus and should be used for cleaning up before and after sex and for cleaning sex toys.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hydrogen peroxide can be purchased from most pharmacies to beused as a gargle and for disinfecting sores or wounds. Though hydrogen peroxide comes from the bottle in a 3% solution. It kills the virus quickly even when diluted with water as low as 10 parts and can be used in many creative ways. For example it can be freshly diluted and used as an added layer of protection when rewetting water-soluble lubricants.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordinary rubbing alcohol at more than 35% concentration is also very effective at killing HIV. It's not much fun in sex but is very handy to have around in case there is an emergency such as when ejaculate accidentally gets into an open sore.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diluted household bleach (1 part bleach, 10 parts water) is excellent for cleaning many sex toys and cleaning up playrooms after sex.<BR>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plastic wrap creates an effective barrier between body juices and can be a lot of fun. It shouldn't be used as a condom unless absolutely necessary. But its &quot;see through&quot; quality makes for a wonderful body wrap for those who need extra protection. It is also great to use just for the fun of it.</TD>
