    lasts around here if it's not made well. Not clothing. Not equipment. Not gear. Not the
    people who use it.<br>
    <br>
    In 1927, <a href="http://www.jimbells.com" target="_top">Jim Bell &amp; Son, Inc</a>.
    began selling well-made goods in downtown <a href="http://www.cottonwoodfalls.com" target="_top">Cottonwood Falls, Kansas</a>, population 900, the county seat of Chase
    County, Kansas, population 2900. </p>
    <p>Protected from cultivation by the rough and rocky terrain, five indigenous grasses grow
    in the hills surrounding <a href="http://www.cottonwoodfalls.com" target="_top">Cottonwood
    Falls</a>, and those native grasses may very well constitute the most prolific source of
    vegetable protein in the world. Ranching is the basis of Chase County's economy, and the
    cowboy way informs a rural lifestyle that measures integrity and sturdiness above all
    other virtues. <br>
    <br>
    This is no town in which to challenge a customer's notion of long-term value.<br>
    <br>
    For 70 years <a href="http://www.jimbells.com" target="_top">Jim Bell's store</a> has
    furnished useful merchandise to people who go to the office only after the day's work is
    done. Jim knew craftsmanship by heart. He understood toughness on sight. Jim lived on this
    prairie, and he found there enough history, beauty, and deep-down freshness to build a
    life and a business on it.<br>
    <br>
    My name is Flint. I'm not Jim Bell, but I know what he saw here, in these hills, breathing
    this air, under a sky that too many of you have never known. You're<br>
    welcome anytime in Chase County. <a href="http://www.cottonwoodfalls.com">Well-made Chase
    County, Kansas.</a></td>
