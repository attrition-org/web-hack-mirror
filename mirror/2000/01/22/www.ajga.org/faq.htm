    <td width="618"><font color="#000000"><b>Q. <a name="Select">How does the AJGA select the
    tourna</a>ment fields?</b></font><p><font color="#000000"><b>A. </b>The AJGA typically
    receives between 300-500 tournament applications per event that the Selection Committee
    uses to select the tournament field. The AJGA tournament application is basically a resume
    of the player's golf experience on the Local, High School, State/Regional, and National
    levels. Because the AJGA conducts tournaments at the highest level of national
    competition, the State/Regional and National tournament experience carry the most weight
    on a application. In 1996, the AJGA published its Selection Process Guidelines and can be
    seen by clicking <a href="Admin/Guidelines.htm">HERE</a>.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>Q. Why does the AJGA allow players who have already signed <a
    name="LetterOfIntent">Letters</a> of Intent to college to play in their events?</b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>A. </b>After years of debate, the AJGA and the USGA agreed to
    create a universal definition of &quot;junior golfer.&quot; That definition is a player
    who has not yet entered college or who has not yet turned 19. By that standard there are
    many players each year who compete in AJGA events after signing a Letter of Intent.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Our theory on this is very simple: We will not penalize a player
    who fits the definition of a junior golfer and who has already signed with a university by
    not allowing them access to our tournaments. There are still many honors and awards that
    can be contended for (e.g. Player of the Year and All-American).</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">The college coaches have asked not to ban college signees from
    our tournaments. It provides them an opportunity to judge younger talent versus players
    who have already accepted college scholarships.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Although the USGA uses this definition of
    junior golfer in the rules of golf, it does not allow 18 year-olds to play in U.S. Junior
    Amateur or U.S. Girls Junior Amateur.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>Q. <a name="Contribution">If I make a contribution to the AJGA
    will my child stand a better chance of getting into the tournament?</a></b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>A. </b>Absolutely not! While contributions made to the AJGA
    Foundation are welcome, the AJGA Selection committee is not aware of these contributions.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">In the past, a player's entry fee has come with a &quot;little
    extra&quot; attached. We simply cash the check, keep enough for the entry fee and refund
    the rest.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>Q. <a name="Girls">Why are the girls fields so small at AJGA
    tournaments?</a></b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>A. </b>Field size of the individual divisions is determined on
    a percentage basis. There will always be a higher percentage of girls playing in the
    tournament than boys. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Typically, we receive about 300 applications per tournament. Of
    those, generally 240 are boys and 60 are girls. For a 120-player field in this instance,
    we would play 90 boys (38%), 30 girls (50%).</font></p>
    <p align="center"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>Q. <a name="Recruiting">What are your thoughts on recruiting
    services? </a></b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>A. </b>The AJGA is not the best organization to answer this
    question. We encourage parents and players who have this question to ask a college golf
    coach that their son or daughter may be interested in playing for. The coach is more able
    to give an opinion on this topic.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>Q. <a name="Seniors">My junior golfer just finished his/her
    junior year in high school and wasn't accepted into the tournament. I thought the AJGA
    gave rising seniors preference?</a></b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>A. </b>When selecting a field, it is the AJGA's obligation to
    our sponsors and our membership as a whole to select the best players among the
    applicants. Most of the time that includes some 13-16 year-olds and means some 17- and
    18-year-olds will not be accepted in the tournament.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">If there are two equal players with like resumes and one is a
    rising senior and the other is 15, the rising senior will get the preference. But the
    bottom line remains this: All players regardless of age, must have demonstrated the skills
    to play at the highest level of competition.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
    <p><b>Q. <a name="FirstAJGA">What does it take to get into my first AJGA event?</a></b></p>
    <p>A. An AJGA Tournament application is basically a resume of a player's performance on
    the local, high school, state/regional, and national level. Typically, all of the player
    that apply to an event have had success on the local level and in high school events. A
    player's performance on the state/regional as well as national level is what will separate
    one player from another. Therefore, I recommend participating in as many state/regional
    events and national tournaments that are not AJGA events.</p>
    <p>The Pepsi Qualifier Series is an excellent way to gain entry into your first event. The
    qualifiers were created to allow talented players to play their way into an AJGA
    tournament if he or she does not have a full resume. Qualifier fields are filled on a
    first-come, first-serve basis and a junior golfer does not need to be a member to compete.
    . If you do not qualify, the qualifier is still considered national tournament experience
    and a good opportunity to compare yourself to other players. To learn more about the Pepsi
    Qualifier Series, Click <a href="QSeries.htm">HERE</a>.</p>
    <p>Included in the membership packet is a contact list of 22 events that the American
    Junior Golf Association uses to select our All-American teams. All of these events are
    quality national events that will help a player gain exposure to college golf programs as
    well as fortify a player's AJGA tournament application. Tournaments such as the U.S.
    Junior, PGA Maxfli, and Big I have local or state qualifiers for the national event. There
    are also other organizations such as the PGA Junior Series, The Junior Tour, and the Nike
    Winternational Tour that run national tournaments all across the country. To view the
    contact information for the AJGA All-American events not conducted by the AJGA, click <a
    href="Tournaments/NonAJGA/99NonAJGA.htm">HERE</a>. </p>
    <p>Finally, it is recommended to play in your Stroke and/or Match Play Junior State
    Championship. A strong finish in state-wide events is a definite benefit especially when
    applying to AJGA events in your state or bordering states.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Most important, when applying to tournaments, DON'T GIVE UP!!!
    The more you apply, the more chances you give the selection committee to get you into
    tournaments.</p>
    <p align="center"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
    <p><b>Q. <a name="Geography">How much does geography affect acceptance to tournament?</a></b></p>
    <p><strong>A.</strong> We do try to have players play as close to home as possible but,
    this is not a guarantee. We would like to accept as many local players as possible but
    still keep the tournament's integrity as a competitive national junior golf tournament. </p>
    <p align="center"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
    <p><a name="Junior-Am"><strong>Q. What is a Junior-Am?</strong></a></p>
    <p><strong>A.</strong> <font size="3">Conducted at 43 of the AJGA's 55 events in 1999,
    Junior-Am Tournaments provide the opportunity for businesses and individuals to provide
    financial support for junior golf while participating in a first-class, competitive golf
    tournament. Similar to Pro-Ams conducted on the PGA and LPGA Tours, a Junior-Am is a team
    scramble comprised of four amateurs and a prominent junior golfer from that week's AJGA
    tournament field. Notable players that have participated in Junior-Ams as juniors include
    Tiger Woods, David Duval, Phil Mickelson, Michelle McGann, Emilee Klein and Vicki Goetze.
    Junior-Ams include numerous awards, prizes and the opportunity to play golf on a
    magnificent course such as Oak Tree Country Club (Ashworth Oklahoma Junior Classic),
    English Turn Golf &amp; Country Club (Classic Foundation Junior at English Turn), and The
    Hills Country Club (Tom Kite Chrysler Junior Classic). Junior-Ams are also a great
    opportunity to help young people who will be the leaders in golf, and in our nation, for
    years to come. If interested in participating in an AJGA Junior-Am in 1999, please contact
    the AJGA at (770) 998-4653 or E-mail at <a href="mailto:ajga@ajga.org">ajga@ajga.org</a>.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Q. <a name="PaceOfPlay">Why does the AJGA have a strict Pace of
    Play Policy?</a></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>A.</strong> The last thing the AJGA wants to do is to penalize
    players for slow play, but the AJGA stresses pace of play at their events for several
    reasons. First, every junior plays better and enjoys his or her AJGA experience when not
    forced to wait between every shot. Secondly, AJGA events are the training grounds for the
    next levels, whether it is college golf or a professional tour.</p>
    <p>Each AJGA tournament has a set pace of play, typically 4 hours, 12 minutes, or four
    hours, 30 minutes. Pace of play depends primarily on the difficulty of the golf course as
    well as weather conditions.</p>
    <p>For your group to be defined as &quot;out of position&quot; by the AJGA, you must 1)
    have an open hole in front of your group; and 2) play over the average allotted time per
    hole. The AJGA official will then time your group, allowing 45 seconds for each shot,
    until it is back in position.</p>

    <p align="left"><a name="Invitational"><strong>Q. How do I get an invited to the
    invitational tournaments?</strong></a></p>
    <p align="left">A. In order to be invited to the invitationals, you must meet requirements
    set forth by the AJGA. </p>
