<p>OK kids.&nbsp; Today's discussion is about security.&nbsp; Or in this instance, the
lack thereof.</p>

<p>Security, as defined in Webster's dictionary, is as follows: </p>

<p>And I quote: &quot;measures taken to guard against espionage or sabotage, crime,
attack, or escape&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -As from Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 10th Edition, page1056
second column def. 4b</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope that you all learned form today's lesson, kids.&nbsp; And remember, never leave
the front door unlocked, especially if you're</p>

<p>not sure what the people in the neighborhood are like.&nbsp; Because, even among the
sheep, there are a few wolves.</p>

<p>And don't forget to do your homework Mr. or Ms. Wells.</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>
