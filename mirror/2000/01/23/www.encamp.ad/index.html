release from HELL:</font></strong></p>

<table border="0" cellPadding="3" width="600">

  <tr>
    <td align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3"></font><font size="3"><font color="#FF0000">Good morning. </font><p><font color="#FF0000">Thank you all for taking the
    time to come out to Lompoc today, my first day of freedom in nearly five years. I have a
    brief statement to read, and I ask that you permit me to read my statement without
    interruption. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">First, I'd like to thank the millions of people who have visited
    the website kevinmitnick.com during my incarceration, and who took the time to show their
    support for me during the past five years. I relied on their support during the five years
    I've been incarcerated more than they will ever realize, and I want to thank them all from
    the bottom of my heart. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">As many of you know, I've maintained virtually complete silence
    during my incarceration -- I've refused dozens of requests for interviews from news
    organizations from around the world, and for very real reasons -- my actions and my life
    have been manipulated and grossly misrepresented by the media since I was 17, when the Los
    Angeles Times first violated the custom, if not the law, that prohibits publication of the
    names of juveniles accused of crimes. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">The issues involved in my case are far from over, and will
    continue to affect everyone in this society as the power of the media to define the
    &quot;villain of the month&quot; continues to increase. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">You see, my case is about the power of the media to define the
    playing field, as well as the tilt of that playing field -- it's about the power of the
    media to define the boundaries of &quot;acceptable discussion&quot; on any particular
    issue or story. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">My case is about the extraordinary breach of journalistic ethics
    as demonstrated by one man, John Markoff, who is a reporter for one of the most powerful
    media organizations in the world, the New York Times. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">My case is about the extraordinary actions of Assistant U.S.
    Attorneys David Schindler and Christopher Painter to obstruct my ability to defend myself
    at every turn. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">And, most importantly, my case is about the extraordinary
    favoritism and deference shown by the federal courts toward federal prosecutors who were
    determined to win at any cost, and who went as far as holding me in solitary confinement
    to coerce me into waiving my fundamental Constitutional rights. If we can't depend on the
    courts to hold prosecutors in check, then whom can we depend on? </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">I've never met Mr. Markoff, and yet Mr. Markoff has literally
    become a millionaire by virtue of his libelous and defamatory reporting -- and I use the
    word &quot;reporting&quot; in quotes -- Mr. Markoff has become a millionaire by virtue of
    his libelous and defamatory reporting about me in the New York Times and in his 1991 book
    &quot;Cyberpunk.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">On July 4th, 1994, an article written by Mr. Markoff was
    published on the front page of the New York Times, above the fold. Included in that
    article were as many as 60 -- sixty! -- unsourced allegations about me that were stated as
    fact, and that even a minimal process of fact-checking would have revealed as being untrue
    or unproven. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">In that single libelous and defamatory article, Mr. Markoff
    labeled me, without justification, reason, or supporting evidence, as &quot;cyberspace's
    most wanted,&quot; and as &quot;one of the nation's most wanted computer criminals.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">In that defamatory article, Mr. Markoff falsely claimed that I
    had wiretapped the FBI -- I hadn't -- that I had broken into the computers at NORAD --
    which aren't even connected to any network on the outside -- and that I was a computer
    &quot;vandal,&quot; despite the fact that I never damaged any computer I've ever accessed.
    Mr. Markoff even claimed that I was the &quot;inspiration&quot; for the movie &quot;War
    Games,&quot; when a simple call to the screenwriter of that movie would have revealed that
    he had never heard of me when he wrote his script. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">In yet another breach of journalistic ethics, Mr. Markoff failed
    to disclose in that article -- and in all of his following articles about me -- that we
    had a pre-existing relationship, by virtue of Mr. Markoff's authorship of the book
    &quot;Cyberpunk.&quot; Mr. Markoff also failed to disclose in any of his articles about
    this case his pre-existing relationship with Tsutomu Shimomura, by virtue of his personal
    friendship with Mr. Shimomura for years prior to the July 4, 1994 article Mr. Markoff
    wrote about me. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">Last but certainly not least, Mr. Markoff and Mr. Shimomura both
    participated as de facto government agents in my arrest, in violation of both federal law
    and jounalistic ethics. They were both present when three blank warrants were used in an
    illegal search of my residence and my arrest, and yet neither of them spoke out against
    the illegal search and illegal arrest. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">Despite Mr. Markoff's outrageous and libelous descriptions of me,
    my crimes were simple crimes of trespass. I've acknowledged since my arrest in February
    1995 that the actions I took were illegal, and that I committed invasions of privacy -- I
    even offered to plead guilty to my crimes soon after my arrest. But to suggest without
    reason or proof, as did Mr. Markoff and the prosecutors in this case, that I had committed
    any type of fraud whatsoever, is simply untrue, and unsupported by the evidence. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">My case is a case of curiosity -- I wanted to know as much as I
    could find out about how phone networks worked, and the &quot;ins&quot; and
    &quot;outs&quot; of computer security. There is NO evidence in this case whatsoever, and
    certainly no intent on my part at any time, to defraud anyone of anything. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">Despite the absence of any intent or evidence of any scheme to
    defraud, prosecutors Schindler and Painter refused to seek a reasonable plea agreement --
    indeed, their first &quot;offer&quot; to me included the requirement that I stipulate to a
    fraud of $80 million dollars, and that I agree never to disclose or reveal the names of
    the companies involved in the case. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">Have you ever heard of a fraud case where the prosecutors
    attempted to coverup the existence of the fraud? I haven't. But that was their method
    throughout this case -- to manipulate the amount of the loss in this case, to exaggerate
    the alleged harm, to cover up information about the companies involved, and to solicit the
    companies involved in this case to provide falsified &quot;damages&quot; consistent with
    the false reputation created by Mr. Markoff's libelous and defamatory articles about me in
    the New York Times. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">Prosecutors David Schindler and Christopher Painter manipulated
    every aspect of this case, from my personal reputation to the ability of my defense
    attorney to file motions on time, and even to the extent of filing a 1700 item exhibit
    list immediately before trial. It was the prosecutors' intent in this case to obstruct
    justice at every turn, to use the unlimited resources of the government and the media to
    crush a defendant who literally had no assets with which to mount a defense. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">The fact of the matter is that I never deprived the companies
    involved in this case of anything. I never committed fraud against these companies. And
    there is not a single piece of evidence suggesting that I did so. If there was any
    evidence of fraud, do you really think the prosecutors in this case would have offered me
    a plea bargain? Of course not. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">But prosecutors Schindler and Painter would never have been able
    to violate my Constitutional rights without the cooperation of the United States federal
    court system. As far as we know, I am the only defendant in United States' history to ever
    be denied a bail hearing. Recently, Mr. Painter claimed that such a hearing would have
    been &quot;moot,&quot; because, in his opinion, the judge in this case would not have
    granted bail. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">Does that mean that the judge in this case was biased against me,
    and had her mind made up before hearing relevant testimony? Or does that mean that Mr.
    Painter believes it is his right to determine which Constitutional rights defendants will
    be permitted to have, and which rights they will be denied? </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">The judge in this case consistently refused to hold the
    prosecutors to any sort of prosecutorial standard whatsoever, and routinely refused to
    order the prosecutors to provide copies of the evidence against me for nearly four years.
    For those of you who are new to this case, I was held in pre-trial detention, without a
    bail hearing and without bail, for four years. During those four years, I was never
    permitted to see the evidence against me, because the prosecutors obstructed our efforts
    to obtain discovery, and the judge in this case refused to order them to produce the
    evidence against me for that entire time. I was repeatedly coereced into waiving my right
    to a speedy trial because my attorney could not prepare for trial without being able to
    review the evidence against me. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">Please forgive me for taking up so much of your time. The issues
    in this case are far more important than me, they are far more important than an unethical
    reporter for the New York Times, they're far more important than the unethical prosecutors
    in this case, and they are more important than the judge who refused to guarantee my
    Constitutional rights. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">The issues in this case concern our Constitutional rights, the
    right of each and every one of us to be protected from an assault by the media, and to be
    protected from prosecutors who believe in winning at any cost, including the cost of
    violating a defendant's fundamental Constitutional rights. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">What was done to me can be done to each and every one of you. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">In closing, let me remind you that the United States imprisons
    more people than any other country on earth. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">Again, thank you for taking time out of your busy lives to come
    to Lompoc this morning, and thank you all for your interest and your support. </font></font></td>
