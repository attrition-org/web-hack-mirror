        its all gone!&quot;. Well I have news fer ya, the guys

        everyone who's pissed off by this pathetic crack - to all
        you dumbass crackers out there, if a site is so easy to

        sites visitors are inconvenienced by not being able to
        access the pages because someone fucking overwrote the

        want to read if you stumbled accross this site
        accidentally and have nothing to do : )</font></p>

            <br>
            CHORUS -<br>
            be what i wanna be! <br>
            what the fuck do you want from me?! <br>
            (quit messing with my head) <br>
            what if i don't want to be <br>
            what the fuck do you want from me <br>
            (quit messing with my head)<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            i see the problems, piling on by the pound <br>
            sometimes i wish, i lived six feet underground <br>
            and when i look, at myself in the mirror <br>
            i wish i could just lay dow and dissapear <br>
            i'm getting sick, and tired of this fucking place <br>
            sometimes i just, wanna put a gun up to my face <br>
            but i know i'd fuck that up in every way i could <br>
            knowing me i'd probably shoot myself in the...... <br>
            foot <br>
            <br>
            (chorus)<br>
            <br>
            well i don't have the right to judge the severity <br>
            of the problems that you deal with daily <br>
            just like you don't have the right, to judge mine <br>
            so get the fuck off my back, or get in line <br>
            see it's a pretty long wait if you wanna fuck with me
            <br>
            pretty soon you'll see my ass on tv <br>
            up in a water tower brandishing an uzi <br>
            learning how much fun target practice really could be
            <br>
            <br>
            (chorus) <br>
            <br>
            well i guess you couldn't ever see why <br>
            mabey cause you never looked me in the eye <br>
            guess you couldn't ever see why (you're right!) <br>
            mabey cause you never looked me in the eye (i'm
            wrong!) <br>
            <br>
            so wait till the day that i buy a gun <br>
            i'll load it up and let bullets fly at dawn <br>
            i wont single out the ones that joked and laughed <br>
            i'll just show up at the reunion and make it a mother
            fucking bloodbath <br>
            <br>
            (chorus)<br>
            <br>
            cause you cant forget the ones that just stood by <br>
            while you were picked on and beat up and left to die <br>
            dont bother apologizing cause i dont give a fuck <br>
            four years went by and you never said &quot;what's
            up&quot; <br>
            </font></p>
