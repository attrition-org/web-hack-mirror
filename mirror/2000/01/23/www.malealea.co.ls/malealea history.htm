        HISTORY
        OF&nbsp;<br>
 MALEALEA LODGE</font></b></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Merwyn Bosworth Smith, founder
        of Malealea Trading Store</b>, was born at Harrow School, England in 1878.
        His father was Assistant Master there for 37 years. Merwyn had five
        brothers and three sisters. All his brothers</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">were
        educated at Harrow, but Merwyn went to Rugby, where he excelled at rugby
        and athletics. He was also a brilliant scholar, writing Latin prose at
        14 years old. On leaving school he went to Oxford University.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">In about 1898 he came to South
        Africa and taught/coached rugby at Bishops. This was too tame for him,
        so he went to try his hand on the Diamond Diggings at Lichtenberg, where
        he did not have much luck. He decided to join the B.S.A.P. in Rhodesia
        (Zimbabwe), where he said he did not do much police work, as he played
        rugby most of the time.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">At the outbreak of the Boer
        War, he returned and joined the Dorset Regiment and served throughout
        the war. At the end of the war, he went to Maseru to visit his brother,
        Reginald, who had joined the Colonial Service and had been sent to
        Basutoland as Government Secretary.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Merwyn was fascinated by the
        country and spent months riding around the country, shooting for the
        pot, as he went along. One of the places he camped at, was Malealea. He
        fell in love with the place and decided to open a Trading Station there.
        He had to return to England to get permission, and was assisted by some
        of his school companions, who were by now in high places. On returning
        to Malealea he started in a tent, first building the store and sheds and
        then starting on the house, which was built of cut stone and under
        thatch. A swimming pool, covered by thatch, was also built, and a tennis
        court. As Merwyn was a fanatic for bridge and billiards he had a
        billiard table brought to Malealea by ox-wagon, as were all the building
        materials. The big verandah had all his shooting trophies on the walls.
        Many also hung in the Bloemfontein and Rand Clubs. The lounge and
        billiard rooms were wood panelled. The lounge was a replica of the
        lounge at Binghams Melcon Dorset, which was the family house, when his
        father retired from Harrow.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">He was well established, when
        the 1914 - 1918 war broke out. He returned to England and again joined
        the Dorset Regiment, who he served with throughout the war. He developed
        &quot;Trench Leg&quot;, which was a problem for the rest of his life.
        After the war he returned to Malealea and in 1919 got married. These
        were golden years. Trade flourished and they used to go on shooting
        safaris in Rhodesia, Caprivi Strip and the Zambezi Valley, - on one
        occasion, taking Basotho Ponies with them. They also had frequent trips
        to England to visit his family. They entertained a lot at Malealea and
        used to ride to Qaba to play tennis with his great friend, Jarvis.
        Merwyn's wife had a cheetah as a pet, but it had a depressing effect on
        trade, so was given to the Johannesburg Zoo!!!</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">The depression years nearly put
        Malealea out of business, but a Johannesburg friend gave Merwyn 12,000
        pound bond to tide him over. many of the local Basotho had credit to buy
        food during this period and they never forgot &quot;MOFANA&quot; for
        this. He was called &quot;MOFANA&quot;, because when he first arrived he
        spoke &quot;Fanagalo&quot;. Later he spoke Sesotho fluently.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">The war years brought
        prosperity, which continued to his death in 1951. During the war R.A.F.
        pupil pilots were entertained at Malealea. Pay for serving Basotho in
        the army was paid out to local families at Malealea. Merwyn arranged
        that on this day the R.A.F. sent a plane over Malealea to do a few
        acrobatics and Victory Rolls. At the end of the war, he had name plates
        made with the name and rank number of all the Basotho, who had fallen in
        the war. Oak trees from Malealea were planted at the police camp in
        Maseru and the idea was that each oak tree would have one of the name
        plates nailed to it.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">During and after the war he had
        two partners, first Scholl, then Crooks. He also had The Falls Store at
        Maletsunyane, but sold this to Frasers at the end of the war. All
        supplies went up by pack horse and the mohair, wool and wheat used to
        come to Malealea in big pack pony trains, and then he classed, graded
        and sent it off by transport to Rail Head Wepener.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">During the last years of
        Mervyn's life, he used to spend the winter months on the Zambezi at a
        Shooting Lodge he built. He had rondavels and a motor boat called
        &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. At this stage his one car was called
        &quot;George&quot; and the other &quot;Elizabeth&quot;. He used to go up
        to Johannesburg for a week just to play Bridge.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">All his life he had a passion
        for road-making and had to make the road from the &quot;Gates of
        Paradise&quot; to Malealea, to get building supplies to Malealea. In his
        latter years he used to set off with labourers, spades, picks and
        wheelbarrows to repair the road. One corner was known as &quot;Tickey
        Draai&quot; and another as &quot;Sixpenny Draai&quot;. The original
        wording at the &quot;neck&quot; as he called it, was: &quot;Wayfarer
        Pause Behold The Gates of Paradise&quot;. He always did this when he
        came home to Malealea.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">His other passion was letter
        writing. He used to write to &quot;The Friend&quot; newspaper in
        Bloemfontein entitled &quot;Basutoland from within&quot;, which covered
        every subject from Incorporation in the Union to strip roads for
        Basutoland on the Rhodesian Model.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">During the Royal Visit the King
        and Queen were to have visited Malealea, but only the rest of the Royal
        Party came for a luncheon. The well known BBC announcer Wynfred Vaughn
        Thomas gave a report of the visit in one of his BBC reports. Mervyn
        attended all the functions in Maseru and he proudly wore his war medals
        at the Ex Service Mens Parade. The King stopped to speak to him and
        said, &quot;I see you served in the SA War, as well as 1914-1918&quot;.
        To which Mervyn replied, &quot;No Your Majesty, not the SA War, I served
        in the Boer War&quot;. A cousin of Mervyn's was one of the Ladies in
        Waiting to the Queen, so he got a few `behind the scenes' stories of the
        tour.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Mervyn died suddenly in January
        1950 and was buried in the garden, by the Bishop of Basutoland. He had
        no headstone as Malealea is his memorial. Malealea was left in trust to
        his son, Anthony, but his partner, Crooks, had an option to purchase
        under the partnership agreement. After a long and expensive court action
        in the Supreme Court, it was ruled that the Trust Deed was not valid,
        because it had not been initialled on one page and Crooks exercised his
        option to purchase.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Soon after Crooks moved into
        the big house from the Cottage, the big house burnt down. There is only
        a bird bath, built out of stone, with ANNO VIC, chiselled around the
        top, that remains from the original house. Mervyn had this bird bath
        built at the end of the war &quot;Year of Victory&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Mervyn always maintained that
        the first thing a person saw, when visiting a Trading Station in
        Basutoland, was the &quot;Long Drop or Kleinhuisie&quot;. He built his,
        hidden away inside the bank below the house and had a beautiful view of
        the Thaba Putsoa range of mountains to gaze upon, in complete privacy.
        It has now been restored.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Many tales were told by
        Government Officials, Police, Tourists, who used to stay over at
        Malealea, before trekking into the mountains. They all enjoyed great
        hospitality at Malealea and if they played Bridge and Billiards, even
        more so. Snooker was only tolerated for Ladies. The leather bound
        billiard score books also stand as a diary for important happenings,
        such as bomb raids over Germany, The Invasion, Visits by Important
        People etc.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Stories about Mervyn begin with
        how he used to ride to Maseru of Mafeteng on a pony to play rugby, with
        an alarm clock tied around his neck, which he would set for half hours
        ahead, in case he dozed off and could wake up to check if the pony was
        still on course. He is reputed to have galloped down the gorge into the
        Ribaneng River, and that path was always known as &quot;Mervyn's
        Ladder&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">AFTER A WILD PARTY IN
        BLOEMFONTEIN, Mervyn and his friends decided to go back to Malealea to
        continue the party. A stranger, they had met, came along as well. In the
        car he was lolling to one side, then to the other side, but no one took
        any notice of him as they thought he was drunk. On arrival it was found
        he was DEAD !!! A wake lasting a few days was held and he lay inside on
        the Billiard Table and was duly buried under the Cherry Trees. Mervyn
        always referred to the grave as &quot;The Stranger's Grave&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">An extract from Kate Cretchley&#146;s
        version of the Stranger&#146;s death! &quot; I doubt it was the fact that
        the hitchhiker was DOA when Mervyn and his pals reached the mountain
        station of Malealea after a fairly lively weekend in Bloemfontein. I
        also doubt that it caused much of a headache when they stowed the old
        guy under the snooker table and went ahead with the intended game.
        However, it must have been a bit annoying to have been awoken by the
        scream of the early rising housemaid who found the old boy rather
        difficult to rouse, even when the best Malealea coffee was offered. A
        wake was held lasting some several days to see the dear departed on his
        way to the pearly gates, during which time he lay in state on the
        snooker table, and the grave of this total stranger still can be seen
        not twenty yards away from that of old Mervyn Smith who, out of the
        kindness of his heart, brought the old man to die in peace and
        tranquillity of Malealea, over fifty years ago.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Mervyn and his friend, Kenneth
        Nolan, were also known to have ridden through the Wepener Hotel on their
        &quot;Trusting Steeds&quot; !</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Keith Jandrell bought Malealea
        in 1961</b> from Norman Crooks. Various managers lived at Malealea operating
        the trading station. An airstrip was built at Malealea and the Jandrell
        family visited Malealea regularly for week-ends and holidays.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Mick &amp; Di Jones bought
        Malealea in December, 1986.</b> The idea was to start</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">a
        very casual lodge and continue with the Trading Station. The Trading
        Station burnt down on 6th March, 1987 due to a gas deep freeze. As the
        floors, walls &amp; ceilings were all wood, the shop went up in flames
        within minutes. Mick was awakened in the early hours of the morning with
        a comment by the night watchman &quot;There seems to be a small problem
        at the shop!!!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">An enormous steel structure was
        erected for the Trading Station - (nicknamed by Simon Fourie, The
        Malealea Emporium.) Over the years the Trading Station has declined and
        the lodge has grown from 10 to 60 beds. The shop was made smaller and
        the space was used to build Bacpackers Accommodation, a games room, a
        diningroom &amp; kitchen. Over the years, Nick King, an Australian
        friend, after driving overland trips from London to Harare, has spent a
        couple of months at Malealea renovating the lodge.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Pony Trekking was started at
        Malealea in February, 1991. Di, Caroline, James &amp; Sonja pony trekked
        into the mountains on a 6 day recce trip with Simon Mokala, now one of
        the main pony trekking guides for the various overnight treks. Cultural
        Tourism has developed at Malealea.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" color="#008000"><font FACE="Wingdings">J</font><font FACE="Times New Roman">
        GUIDES &amp; HORSES ARE HIRED FROM THE LOCAL BASOTHO PEOPLE FOR THE PONY
        TREKKING.&nbsp; </font></font></p>
        <p></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">A Pony
        Trekking Association has been formed, a committee is elected and a
        percentage of the income for trekking is kept in a fund. This is used to
        buy equipment for the association, for example saddlery, bridles, saddle
        blankets, etc. In the meantime to get the trekking on its way, the horse
        owners use their own saddlery until stocks build up over the years. We
        hand the bookings to the association every week and they organize which
        horses and guides take the treks. Horse Owners have realized the
        importance of strong and healthy horses. One day a German Tour Operator
        wanted to have a look at the horses used for the trekking. We asked a
        Basotho Guide to bring his best horse. Well when we went to have a look
        at it, to us it was the scruffiest, untidiest looking horse. On
        questioning the guide, he informed us that &quot;Sister&quot; was their
        best and strongest horse for getting up the mountain passes. We have
        since had reports from clients that &quot;Sister&quot; is indeed the
        best horse they have ridden.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Guides are learning to
        communicate and speak broken English with their visitors. One particular
        bright young guide often asks the clients the meanings of words he does
        not understand and immediately tries to use the words in further
        conversations. One couple were so pleased with their trek, they took
        their guide to the Lesotho Sun for lunch. This was an experience of a
        lifetime for someone who previously had only been herding cattle &amp;
        sheep. There are a quite a few young &amp; older guides who have managed
        to build their own houses from income received for guiding and hiring
        out their horses. Horses arrive from all directions and eventually,
        almost on time, the treks set off: - Clients, Pack Horses and Guides
        into the distant mountains. &quot;Amongst this confusion of horses there
        seems to be some sort of organized chaos,&quot; mused a client.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Within the first half hour of
        the pony trek, nerves are tested by going down the gorge to the
        Makhaleng river. One way of doing it, it is said is to &quot;Close your
        eyes, hold tightly onto your horse and pretend not to hear the rocks
        rolling down the mountainside.&quot; But you needn&#146;t be worried, the
        Guides are excellent in the way they coax the horses and nervous clients
        down the gorge and across river.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">En route to the remote villages
        you come across magnificent scenery and are often lucky enough to come
        across various activities,</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">a) Like boys preparing for
        initiation school.<br>
        b) Bali Girls and<br>
        c) A Sangoma throwing her
        bones.<br>
        d) It is etiquette for the
        guides to introduce the visitors the chiefs of the various villages and
        to inform them of their destination. As the areas are really remote, the
        children are curious to see the visitors. It is as if the circus has
        come to town!!!<br>
        e) Local traditions are
        explained to visitors as they pass by villages. When passing a certain
        place, (generally between two hills) where there is a heap of small
        stones piled together, one should pick up another stone alongside the
        path, spit on it and throw it on the heap. This is an omen of good luck
        and good eating along the journey and at the destination. Common
        mountains of Sefikeng and Sefikaneng derived their names from such big
        heaps made there in olden times.</font></p>

        in really remote areas of Lesotho. Half the accommodation fee is paid to
        the owner of the hut and the balance is kept in a fund for buying
        equipment for old and new huts opening as the trekking gets busier. The
        huts at this stage are equipped with mattresses on the floor, gas
        cookers, very basic pots &amp; pans and a bucket of water.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Arriving at the hut in the late
        afternoon, in time to see the herdboys returning with the cattle &amp;
        sheep, which are kept in the kraal nearby the huts where you stay.
        Firewood is scarce on the high mountain ranges, so fire is made from
        scrub and dried out cow-dung. The meals are prepared in large
        three-legged black pots.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">The children often sing for
        visitors in the evenings and are rewarded. This is still spontaneous and
        just seems to happen without any rehearsals. Come morning, the sounds of
        the cocks crowing, donkeys braying, cows mooing and pigs grunting gently
        wakes you up. No chance of a late morning sleep, but the spectacular
        sunrise is more than enough compensation for this sacrifice.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">There are many stories of
        delightful experiences in the villages. There is the story of the hen
        sitting on her eggs in the window-sill of a hut. Another group later
        reported that the chicks and hen still occupied the window-sill. Another
        group told with great relish of the chief who offered them home-made
        beer from a large black drum. Suddenly the donkey came along and also
        had a drink of beer from the same drum!!!</font></p>

        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">A particularly pleasant
        experience is the friendliness and helpfulness of the Basotho people.
        There is the story of the family whose car broke down in a remote area.
        A Basotho man took them into their village and then gave them a lift to
        Maseru in his &quot;Clapped out Bakkie&quot;. He was most informative
        about daily happenings and culture in the villages and turned out to be
        a talented tour guide. This was actually the highlight of the family&#146;s
        stay in Lesotho. From Maseru they then hired a local taxi back to the
        lodge late that night and again found the taxi owner to be a natural
        tour operator.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">The Keg Group tells of their
        delightful and unexpected pleasure when doing a pub crawl in the village
        shebeens. The Basotho Shebeens were so welcoming and honoured that our
        guests were visiting them, they wanted to kill a sheep there and then
        and great cultural interaction took place. The bar was then named
        &quot;The Keg &amp; Pere&quot;, which is the Sesotho name for Horse.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">I was once photographing a
        herdboy with his sheep &amp; goats. I jokingly said to him, &quot;Please
        make your goats move to another area.&quot; With that he took out his
        &quot;Basotho Leseba&quot; (kind of a flute), whistled and played a
        tune. The goats were directed to where we wanted them to go.</font></p>

        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">While I was on the original 6
        day recce trip with two friends and a Basotho Guide, Tseliso, we must
        have set off in one of the highest rainfall seasons in Lesotho. On the
        third day, while riding in three hours of solid rain to our next hut
        destination, we all decided we had had enough and asked Tseliso if we
        could get back a day earlier. He shook his head and said there was no
        way and the horses plodded along. I then said to Tseliso &quot; How
        about if we pay you for a 6 day trek, but we get home in 5 days!!!&quot;
        Well from that moment the horses just took off and we got home a day
        earlier. On the trek Chief Puli sent us a tray of tea in his best enamel
        tea pot and mugs, decorated with flowers. His village is called &quot;Sekoting
        sa lifarike&quot; (which means, &quot;The trough which the pigs
        dug,&quot; as this valley is surrounded by a magnificent ring of
        mountains,)</font></p>

        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">The Mountain Kingdom of Lesotho
        may be rough and tough, but it is at the same time as gentle as a spring
        flower, soft as the summer grass covering the undulating hills,
        refreshing as a sparkling mountain stream in autumn and awesome and
        austere as a winter landscape. Whatever your choice of climate may be,
        Lesotho can provide. Of particular value is the quiet nearness of nature
        offering the overworked and over stressed a tranquility nowhere else to
        be equaled. This makes Lesotho the ideal venue for conferences, because
        it forces people to leave behind their day to day routines so
        restricting for creative and innovative thinking. People caught in ruts
        are so busy fighting for their daily survival in competitive
        environments that they can&#146;t afford to risk replacing old ideas with
        new ones for fear of failure. Trekking in Lesotho restores those long
        forgotten feelings of daring and adventure.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">WHAT MAKES LESOTHO SO
        DIFFERENT?</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Well take those same life weary
        people and throw them into the cultural environments and experiences of
        a Lesotho Trek and they cannot but open their eyes and minds to the
        people around them, who behave differently, have different needs,
        priorities and goals in completely different circumstances. Yet the
        observer is surprised to find that the challenges are the same:
        Survival: Profit: Competition: &amp; Quality of Life.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">The discovery of this awareness
        inadvertently opens the eyes and suddenly, standing the clear crisp dawn
        you find that you are beginning to think differently. While you marvel
        at the quaintness of the people around you, you find that you are
        actually learning from them. Of course, facing the adventures of a trek
        is excellent for team building. All in all, there will be times when a
        pony trek in Lesotho, may force you to close your eyes and there will be
        times when it will open your eyes. Either way you return to your own
        environment with a greater energy and a new outlook on life.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;AN EXTRACT OF A TREK
        REPORT, OCTOBER 1991, INDICATING THE RESPONSIBILITY THE GUIDES HAVE ON
        THESE PARTICULAR TREKS&quot;</font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">
        Rough, tough and very, very different is this &quot;Roof of Africa&quot;
        trek into the Lesotho mountains. It must be hiking as it was many years
        ago - no detailed trail maps, no laid out trails with markers. no log
        cabins with toilet and braai facilities. Instead your guide (on pony)
        obtains the frequent help of the villagers as to the best way up the
        mountainsides, or across the many river crossings, and then negotiates,
        on your behalf, with the local chief for a suitable hut for that
        particular overnight stay !!! Plenty of drinking water is supplied, and
        even cleaning the mud off your hiking boots is included in the princely
        sum of R15.00 per person !!!!</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">There is no need to cater down
        to the last dehydrated pea, as the other Basotho Bay which accompanies
        the group is our pack-horse. It carries huge leather panniers into which
        are packed your food supplies, clothing and all other
        &quot;MEDICINAL&quot; requirements for the trek. The Pack Horse amazes
        all by the remarkable feats it performs in defying the laws of gravity
        on the many treacherous ascents and descents.</font></p>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">The &quot;Glamour&quot; of the
        trek lies in the innumerable mountain peaks, valleys, waterfalls,
        streams and rivers which are relatively unspoilt by mankind and mot
        least of all the very friendly locals. Lesotho is truly a country of
        water which is evident everywhere. We were unfortunate to be there
        during the highest rainfall recorded in the past 100 years !!! The last
        two days were a race to beat the fast rising rivers. Our crossing of the
        Makhaleng River could only be achieved by boat. Not so lucky for the
        horses who had to swim across the raging river. After a hard swim they
        arrived on the other side apparently no worse for wear as they began
        grazing almost immediately!!! We safely made our way to the comfort of
        the Malealea Lodge, which was our base, and left our rural guide in
        wonderment as to why these crazy hikers pushed on through the pouring
        rain, rather than rest up in a mountain hut and take another week or two
        to complete the trek when the weather cleared!!! At the end of it all
        the question is - Is it worth it? The answer is a very definite YES!!!
        The long treks are not recommended for the faint-hearted - but then the
        trail can be tailored for your individual requirements.</font></p>
