        <td width="95%"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2" color="#008000"><b>JOBO ADVENTURE</b> </font><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">Start out at Malealea Lodge, drive for 3 km, follow the left fork at
        Likhohloaneng for another 3 km, until you go through &quot;The Gates of Paradise
        Pass&quot;. A spectacular view of the &quot;Roof of Africa&quot;. Follow this road for
        another 1 km and turn left. Following this road you will have a good view of the gorge on
        the right, snow capped mountains (in winter) and villages scattered around. Up to this
        point it is a very good all weather road.</font>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" SIZE="2">After 7
        km driving on a plateau, you will reach the village of Ha Qaba. There are a few potholes
        and an average of 40 -50 km/h is advised. The road winds down to the Sekering, with a
        beautiful gorge on the left. 9 km from Qaba, the road makes a 180 degree turn to the river
        on the left. Follow this small two track road for 400m along the riverbank. Turn right at
        the poplar trees (good picnic spot) to cross the river. Here a high lift jack or a second
        vehicle would be recommended. Our Basotho Guide asked me the Million Dollar question,
        after being stuck in the river sand for 30 minutes, &quot;Why do you go through the river
        if the bridge is just around the corner???&quot; This is open to suggestions! Follow the
        road left up the escarpment on the opposite river bank. Follow the two track road straight
        into the village, Kakoanyane and turn left onto the &quot;main road&quot;. Follow this
        road past the Ribaneng High School. When you have travelled 9 km from the river, the road
        will fork, take the left fork. Follow this winding road through villages for another 4 km,
        on the main road. Here you must take the right fork, the road is badly eroded and a 4 x 4
        is recommended. As you follow the winding roads through the villages, remember the
        following code of makeshift flags, clolouring the landscape. Stop and sample, if you dare,
        the following goods:<br>
        1 White flag - Beer made of Sorghum - recommended for a strong stomach.<br>
        2. Yellow flag - Beer made of Barley<br>
        3. Green flag - selling vegetables.<br>
        4 Red flag - selling meat.</font><p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">Follow the mountain pass,
        at times very steep and difficult. Not recommended for novice drivers. On your way up,
        don&#146;t forget to absorb the beauty of the Ribaneng Gorge on the left and the Jobo
        Gorge on the right. The last 100 m being the most difficult, should only be done by very
        experienced drivers as there is no turn around point and a very tricky three point turn is
        required to follow the same route back down the mountain. I would advise your&nbsp;
        passengers to leave the car at this stage!!! When you get to the dead end on top, it is
        advised you take the 20 minute hike to the top of the mountain where a village, Jobo is
        situated with the most spectacular views of Lesotho you can ever imagine. It is this view
        and the challenge of the treacherous mountain pass, which makes this 4 x 4 route a must to
        any visitor in the area with the necessary experience. On your return home take the Qaba -
        Malealea 4 x 4 route.</font></td>

        back to Ha Qaba. Turn right at Ha Qaba lodge and follow this road for 1.5 km and turn
        right. Turn right another 300 m further. Turn left 800 m further and left again 300m
        further. Turn left 400m on and 300m further across the river on the right and up the steep
        embankment. Follow this road for 1.6 km and turn right onto the main road to Malealea
        Lodge. Here you will have Mick &amp; Di Jones welcoming you with a lovely hot shower, a
        good old bottle of Tassies and a scrumptious meal cooked by Aggie and Mantumeng. Sitting
        around a fire at night with travellers from all around the world, you can enjoy the
        peaceful tranquility and share a love for Africa.</font></td>

        4's<b>.</b> A morning drive past the Botsoela waterfall and circular route through remote
        villages back to Malealea. Road is quite good and not really 4 x 4 , but magnificent
        scenery. The road hugs the side of a mountain, also a hand-built road. Drive back towards
        the &quot;Gates of Paradise Pass&quot;. Take the right fork at 3 kms from Malealea Lodge.
        Continue for 14.1 kms and leave the vehicle at the bottom of the pass. En-route the 14.1
        kms do not take the road going straight, but turn sharp right to go down the pass. To get
        to the top of the waterfall look out point, hike downstream for about 500m on the right
        side of the stream. Hike over the small stream and continue around the top of the gorge to
        the far point. This is the best view of the waterfall and Botsoela stream gorge. The first
        view of the waterfall is not the best one. From here, on the left hand side of the stream,
        you can see the path going down to the waterfall, if you wish to join the pony trekkers.
        Continue the drive from the waterfall up the pass for about 5 kms until you reach the view
        point.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">Walk up a small hill to view the panoramic scene of
        Malealea and it&#146;s valleys. Either backtrack to the lodge with views in opposite
        directions or: Continue on a circular route taking all the left turns, until you are back
        at Malealea via &quot;The Gates of Paradise.&quot; This will take about 2 ½ hours.</font></td>
