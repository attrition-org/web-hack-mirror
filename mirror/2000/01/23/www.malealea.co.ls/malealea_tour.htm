              and unspoilt. The historical <b> cave house</b> of Rev Ellenberger &amp;
              his family is at the Masitise Primary School just before Quthing.
              He established the Paris Evangelical mission in 1835. Here you can
              view a <b> dinosaur footprint</b> embedded in the roof of the cave and the
              local priest will tell you about the history of the families. Just
              past the turnoff to Mt. Moorosi from Quthing are more Dinosaur
              Footprints embedded in the rock. There is a Danish-government
              sponsored complex at the sight alongside the road a few hundred
              metres from the turn off. Drive past <b> Mt Moorosi</b> and up the nearby
              mountain away from the main town. Introduce yourself to the chief
              or head man and find a compsite. A spectacular view overlooking
              the Orange or Senqu River.Here is the Mt. Moorosi mountain, well
              known for the gun war of Chief Moorosi and the Cape Mounted
              Rifles. (Old bullets are still found on the mountain &amp; Paul
              Kruger&#146;s inscription is inside one of the caves.)</font></td>

              Ha Reeng School sign turn left into the first village and ask for
              Paulus Thelang. This is difficult 4 x 4 track to traverse, but
              full of excitment trying to get to one of the most beautiful sites
              in Lesotho. Take a hike down to the confluence of the Orange
              River.</font>
