<p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">The night was very successful, it started with
the first round (a knockout round ) with 6 to each table we had over over 40 entrants. The
first round lasted 20mins. The winner fom each table gained a place in the semmi-final
from which 4 finalists came through. The final&nbsp; lived up to the Zappa motto, GO BIG
OR GO HOME, Wayne, last years finalist, was once again there showing how it is done. 3 of
the finalists did eventualy decide to call it a night before the time was up!! Leaving a
winner for the 1998 Zappa Sambuca coinage regional champs, good-luck to him in the
national finals in Cape Town. What made this evening extra big was the crowd
participation, especialy in the final.</font></small></p>
