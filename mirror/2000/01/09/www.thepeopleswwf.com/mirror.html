<p align="center">Serious Problem At Hand As you can all see on http://www.thepeopleswwf.com we were hacked. No, not by some little idiot who just got our password, this guy is a major player. If you check out the sites he posted, they are ALL major hacker sites.  I don't know why, or how he got into my ftp stuff, but he did.  Basically, I am at the guys mercy as we speak. I don't know what to do, and one slip up and he could take all my stuff out.</p><br>

<i><B>I won't take his shit out, i'm a nice guy =)</B></i>

Though I don't have to much respect for how our nation is dealing with people... Thanks for actually putting money toward our countries computer security. You should have done that the first time. <b>Take Eric Burns out of jail, and thank him... he could've done a lot more damage, and he could have been a foreign terrorist.</b>
