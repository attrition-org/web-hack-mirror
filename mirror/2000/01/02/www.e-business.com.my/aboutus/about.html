Swiftcom was established in 1995 by a group of computer and 
telecommunication professionals based on the vision of the accelerating 
trend of convergence of computer and communication services. 
Swiftcom is a subsidiary company of Swiftnet (M) Sdn. Bhd. which holds
a value-added data network license issued by the Telecommunication 
Department of Malaysia (or Jabatan Telekom Malaysia) to provide value-
added telecommunication services. Swiftcom operates an Internet access
network called Nasionet to provide value-added Internet and intranet 
services to customers.<BR><BR>

<B>Nasionet - A Seamless Data Network of Technology and Services</b><br><BR>

Nasionet is our high-performance data network backbone with point-of-presence
throughout Malaysia to deliver our comprehensive set of online access services, 
Internet access and corporate networking services. Currently we have a 
substantial customer base around the Klang Valley, Johor Baru and Penang regions.
We also operate an intranet service providing value-added private data
network to corporate users such as financial institutions having branches
in West and East Malaysia.<BR><BR>

The Nasionet Internet access service is enhanced with our high-performance
Internet backbone, which has multiple T1/E1 connections via several carriers
to the worldwide Internet. We emphasize availability and performance level
of our service. The Nasionet Internet service is backup with our 
knowledgeable technical service professionals to ensure the successful and 
satisfied installation of every network implementation of our customers.<BR><BR>

<B>Nasionet Products and Services Features</b><BR><BR>

We provide a broad range of products and services to enable companies
to leverage on the new trend of merging computer and communication
technology for business applications. Our products and services will
transcend the operational and marketing capabilities of the twenty-first
century businesses using the ubiquitous and cost-effective Internet
communication media and Internet-based technology.<BR><BR>

<B>Comprehensive, From-Start-To-Finish Range of Products</B><BR><BR>

We emphasize on providing flexible, cost-effective and start-of-the-art
but practical solutions that meet customers's requirements. Products
come with a wide range of flexible networking and technical services
to give customers end-to-end, one-stop solutions. We ensure quality and
successful set up of every system we installed.<BR><BR>

<B>Nasionet<I>Personal</I> Internet Service</B><BR><BR>

An off-the-shelf, instantly installable Internet dial-up access service
that comes with one e-mail account. Customer purchases from any of the 
Nasionet appointed dealers a Nasionet CD which enable him to install
the browser software and sign-u[ to the Nasionet Internet access and
e-mail service <U>on his own</u> within a few minutes.<BR><BR>

<B>Nasionet<I>Team</I> Internet Service</B><BR><BR>
This Internet service is similar to the "instant-online" Nasionet<I>Personal</I>
service but allows the customer to sign up a few more e-mail accounts
with Nasionet. This service is ideal for a small team of 2-5 members or very 
small businesses. Team members share a single Nasionet dial-up Internet access account.<BR><BR>

<B>Nasionet<I>Office</I> Internet Service</B><BR><BR>
This is a hassle-free and robust Internet service solution for offices
that have 5-20 (or more) users but does not have the Internet expertise
to handle the technical deatails. It allows all the users in an office
to share an Internet dial-up account, but unlike the other approaches
(such as the antiquated UUCP dial-up account) provided by other service
provides, it enables all the users on a local-area-network to browse
and access the Internet and Web information concurrently. Each of the
users has their own private e-mail account with individual e-mail access password.<BR><BR>

Customers of Nasionet<I>Office</i> have the choice of using software
or hardware based Internet proxy technology to achieve these features.
A dedicated Internet server for providing e-mail and Internet access
functions is not required, hence the administrative and technical chores 
associated with the maintenance of ane-mail and Internet server are
eliminated, as all the Internet and e-mail services are provided by
Nasionet. A single dial-up modem is shared among the users. For higher 
access speed, 2-4 modems are connected to our hardward-based Internet
proxy to enhance performance. All the necessary software and hardware
will be supplied by us as a total solution.<BR><BR>

The Nasionet<I>Office</i> configuration can be set up on a single PC,
several standalone PC's, or on a local area network without any hassle
and does not require any specialised technical know-how from the customers.
We assist in the installation of the network and system. The Nasionet<I>Office</i> 
comes with one free homepage and some free web page disk space.<BR><BR>

Customers may also register their own Internet domain name to reflect
their corporate identity on their e-mail accounts, i.e. in the form of
<U>whoiswho@yourcompanyname.com.my</u>. Nasionet also provides the
"Virtual Server Hosting" service which when used with the dial-up
Nasionet<I>Office</i>  will make a company's Internet presence to look
big by appearing to have a dedicated high-speed Internet access and server.
Your clients will access your homepage by pointing at the URL
<U>http://www.yourcompanyname.com.my,</u> instead of the usual, 
not-so-professional looking <U>http://www.ISPname/yourdirectory</U>
as provided by most other ISP's.<BR><BR>


<B>Nasionet<I>Value-Lines</I> Services</B><BR><BR>
These are dedicated leased-line Internet services for companies that allow
other Internet users to access to their Internet servers and Internet-based
applications and information services all the time. Companies that use
Nasionet<I>Value-Lines</I> are those running national-wide or international
operations and branch offices, Web-based information and content services,
commercial Web-accessed services (such as cyber cafes), electronic commerce
Web servers, and intranet applications. As a licensed value-added 
telecommunication service provider, we work closely with other telcos and 
carriers to provide the start-to-finish value-added solutions and technical
services to implement the Web-based system that progressive companies seek
to capitalise on the effectiveness of the Internet as a new business delivery
platform. Unlike other ISP's which tend to provide 'basic' Internet access
service only and leave the customers with a partial service, Nasionet emphasizes 
on business-oriented applications and provides companies witht the complete
products and services that require no special technical capabilities
from the customers to implement Internet-based solutions. There is a wide
base of businesses that potentially can use Nasionet services to improve
their business processes, and these businesses can be small and medium
scale companies that aspire to extend their boundaries by leveraging on
our value-added services.<BR><BR>

For example a manufacturer of motor vehicle spare parts may decide to
subscribe to the Nasionet<I>Value-Lines</I> service and run a computer
server that installed with an Internet-based order processing, inventory 
and 'electronic billing' software (also supplied and serviced by Nasionet).
This transcend the manufacturer's order processing and billing capability
to a much higher level by allowing its dealers (such as the car workshops 
and spare parts resellers) to place orders directly to the company by
accessing to its Web-based order forms via dial-up Internet access. The
dealers get online feedbacks on availability of goods and able to track
the status of their orders. The manufacturer has up-to-date picture about
the demands of its products and adjust its production process in a more
timely manner. Cash flow and credit control will improve through the 
process of sending invoices and even receiving payments through the
Internet-based system.<BR><BR>

The Nasionet<I>Value-Lines</I> Internet and intranet services are designed
for maximum flexibility and cost-effectiveness to meet the requirements of
the users. It can be configured with analog, digital, bandwidth-on-demand
(or dial-up) and combination of these telecommunication lines. 
Nasionet<I>Value-Lines</I> usually provides bandwidth of 28.8/33.6kbps,
2x28.8, 64kbps to 256 kbps - the typical range of most business applications
will need. For the users who need to go online urgently, we instantly install
a 2x28.8 bandwidth-on-demand (or dial-up) configuration and the users get
their access immediately while they wait for the dedicated lines to be
installed by the telcos - some effort that other ISP's will never do.
Customers can always rely on us to provide the responsive services and reliable
solutions.<BR><BR>

The Nasionet<I>Value-Lines</I> service comes with a pre-configured router, 
so that the customer will not need to worry about router installation. Modems
are also provided for the case of analog lines. The customer just needs
to connect the router to his local area network (hub). Our service includes
providing technical advice on the configuration and installation of the
customers' local area network, the Internet server and firewall. We aim to
make the entire system work for our customers.<BR><BR>

Nasionet operates a comprehensive set of automated network management tools
to ensure our customers' network is working reliably. Customers will get a
dependable network service, and will even be provided with up-to-date 
information of their network status and usage.<BR><BR>

<B>Internet Domain Name Registration Service</b><BR><BR>

An Internet domain name is usually a company name or trademark name. 
(It is highly advisable for companies to register their business and trademark
names as Internet domain names as commercial usage of the Internet is expected
to be widespread). We assist customers to register their Internet domain name
with the relevant bodies and proceed to host the domain name if the customers
do not have the required Internet servers.<BR><BR>

<B>Web Page Hosting Service and Virtual Server Hosting Service</B><BR><BR>

Disk space is allocated on our Internet servers for Nasionet users' Web pages.
This enables other Internet users to access to our customers homepages
and other Web pages in the fastest possible speed. When a Nasionet<I>Office</i> 
customer also signs up the Virtual Server Hosting Service, the customer will
get the advantage of having a professional Internet presence as if he is
running a high-speed dedicated Internet access leased line and server.<BR><BR>

<B>Intranet Solutions and Services</b><BR><BR>

Nasionet<I>Value-Lines</i> and the other Swiftcom supplied Web-based business
applications provide the complete package for companies to set up their 
corporate intranets. Intranets are company-wide internal networks that 
are built on Internet technology. The advantage of setting up internet 
technology-based company-wide network as compared to having a proprietary
network is that the company can choose to 'open' and extend some of its
services and business applications to their customers and business associates
who will access to the services via the borderless public Internet. We provide
state-of-the-art network security solutions such as firewall software and smart
card based Internet access security device to ensure the secure and controlled
access of a corporate Intranet from the public Internet.<BR><BR>

Our total intranet service package includes : the planning and design of
the intranet, the supply of Internet or Frame-relay routers and network 
equipment (such as modems), working with telcos for the installation and
commissioning of the communication lines, providing application software 
and security solution, and the on-going technical support and network 
management service.<BR><BR>

<B>Network Management Services</b><br><BR>

We operate 24-hour network management service to ensure customers of Nasionet 
services obtain the most reliable and effective network services possible. This
includes providing customers with up-to-date information on network status
and usage, and statistics to assist customers in network capacity planning.
Our routers comes with network management features that we exploit to 
manage the customers' networks.<BR><BR>

<B>Technical and Support Services</b><BR><BR>

Our strengths extend further than just providing basic Internet access or
communication line services. Our emphasis is on value-added products and 
services such as providing customers with complete consulting and implementation
services on Internet and intranet planning, design and set up. We develop business
applications that customers can deploy as the value-added services to their
Internet network or intranet. We have extensive experience, expertise and software
solutions on online transaction processing and database applications which we
apply to our technical assistance extended to our customers. Our customers too can
deploy real-world and robust data processing applications via the Internet and
intranet and exploit the real benefits of network computing for their businesses.<BR><BR>

<B>Other Business-critical Solutions and Services</b><BR><BR>

We provide other business-critical solutions such as Web-based business application
software, electronice fund transfer (EFT) switching software which interfaces to
automated teller machines, point-of-sales devices and card-based payment systems. We
had installed EFT and Internet home banking solution to local financial institutions.
We represent and support the complete EFT and Internet home banking solutions from
SLM Software Inc. of Canada. These electronic payment solutions form the core for
electronic commerce applications. Unlike other service providers and hardware vendors,
our business is already involved the actual implementation of Internet-based, secured 
payment systems. We see ourselves as having the best value-added solutions for
Internet or intranet business-critical applications and services that can transcend
our cutomers' business to exploit the newly emerged networked world.<BR><BR><BR>
