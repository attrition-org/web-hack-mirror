<CENTER><FONT FACE="Colonna MT"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF"><FONT SIZE=+2>The
Domain of Northern Virginia rose to prominence within the Camarilla shortly
after its establishment under the auspices of Prince Genna Xavias.&nbsp;
Though the Domain has faced numerous challenges through out the years,
it has remained in the forefront of Camarilla politics for quite some time.</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Colonna MT"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF"><FONT SIZE=+2>Unlike
some of her neighboring and sister Domains, unsavory elements like the
Sabbat, or even the Anarchs, have found no home or quarter in NVA.&nbsp;
Though the citizens of&nbsp; the Domain have fought numerous wars against
the Sabbat, Garou, and other assorted enemies, the Domain has remained
steadfastly Camarilla.</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Colonna MT"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF"><FONT SIZE=+2>Throughout
the years Northern Virginia began to develop a reputation as a very accepting
and tolerant domain, noted for it's large number of Independent residents
and relaxed attitude.&nbsp; However, the Domain is far from perfect.&nbsp;
From spies at the highest level of City Office to internal struggle and
strife within the Clans, Northern Virginia has always held its own nervous
edge.</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Colonna MT"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF"><FONT SIZE=+2>With
sister domains in Baltimore, Southern Maryland, and Washington DC, Northern
Virginia remains the oldest southern stronghold of the Camarilla along
the East Coast, serving as the first point of contact for the Sabbat and
Garou working up through the South-Eastern United States.</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Colonna MT"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF"><FONT SIZE=+2>Though
it has had it's troubles, Northern Virginia remains much like it was when
founded so long ago...</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Colonna MT"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF"><FONT SIZE=+2>Proud,</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Colonna MT"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF"><FONT SIZE=+2>Loyal,</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>
