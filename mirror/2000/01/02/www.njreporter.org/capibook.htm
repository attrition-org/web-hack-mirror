<font face="Century Schoolbook" size="2">
<B>Multiple Municipal Madness -- </B>Alan Karcher, a former New Jersey Assembly speaker, <img src="madness.jpg" border="0" align="right">
examines the petty conflicts -- from location of railroad stations to capture of existing ratables 
to the battles of "wets" vs. "drys" -- that led to the creation of 566 separate municipalities 
in a state with just 7,493 square miles. Karcher tells how "the incredible shrinking 
Shrewsbury Township" went from covering most of Monmouth and Ocean counties to just 
one-tenth of a square mile and how you have to be a member of the country club just to 
enter Pine Valley, whose population of 19 resides on the golf course grounds. 
A longtime student of public policy, Karcher concludes by urging the Legislature to 
pass a mandatory consolidation program that would require 461 municipalities to find 
partners for merger within 10 years. (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, November 
1998, 238 pages. $49 hardcover, $22 softbound)<br>

<B>Juries, Jails, and Justice: The Sheriff's Office in New Jersey since the Seventeenth Century -- </B>
Until the 1900's, the man with the sheriff's badge was the most powerful official in New<img src="jury.gif" align="right"> 
Jersey's county government. Today, the badge and the office remain, but decades of attacks 
by government officials and reformers have so eroded the sheriff's powers that the office 
may no longer be necessary, concludes Harris I. Effross, research professor at the Center 
for Government Services at Rutgers University's Bloustein School. Effross traces the 
history of the sheriff's office, the reform efforts of Governor Woodrow Wilson, and how 
the New Jersey State Police was created to take away the responsibility for apprehending 
criminals from county sheriffs. He recommends that a commission be set up to examine 
whether New Jersey will need sheriffs in the 21st Century.
