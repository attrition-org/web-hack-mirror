</B><P>The Center for Analysis of Public Issues is an independent, nonpartisan public policy institute dedicated to expanding public awareness, providing original analysis and proposing new solutions to the most crucial issues facing New Jersey.</P>
<P>CAPI was founded in 1970 by Richard Leone, Paul Ylvisaker and other state officials who would have been best described as "policy wonks" -- if the term had been in use 28 years ago. Today, the <a href="board.htm">Board of Trustees</a> is chaired by Linda Stamato, deputy director of the Center for Negotiation &amp; Conflict Resolution at Rutgers University. Mark J. Magyar, a veteran Statehouse reporter who served as a policy adviser in the Whitman administration, was selected last May as CAPI's new president. Sharon Naeole serves as vice president for administration and development.</P>
<P>CAPI's second president, John Kolesar, who is still a CAPI board member, started a newsletter in 1975 that grew into <I>New Jersey Magazine </I>the following year. It was renamed <I>New Jersey Reporter</I> in 1979 and has been published continuously ever since. The 23 years of analysis, commentary and investigative reporting its has provided led the <I>New York Times</I> to refer to CAPI as the "institutional memory" of the state. </P>
<P>But CAPI is more than just a magazine.</P>
<P>Over the years, we have issued public policy reports on subjects as varied as land use, education financing, tax reform and social services. We publish the <a href="http://royal.reliaserve.com/njrepforms/capibook.htm">New Jersey Political Almanac</a> every two years after the new Legislature is elected, and we have published books on political corruption and the impact of casino gambling in Atlantic City. CAPI's Senior Fellow, John Weingart, is writing a book this fall on low-level radioactive waste siting issues.</P>
<P>We also have developed special expertise in campaign finance issues and maintain a <a href="http://www.crp.org/capi/">Campaign Finance</a> website, with the assistance of the Center for Responsive Politics, that provides public access to campaign finance reports. The website, which is searchable by contributor, candidate and town, includes full data from the 1993 and 1995 state races, as well as gubernatorial primary and legislative leadership PAC contributions. Information from the gubernatorial general election and individual legislative races will be added as soon as it is available from the Election Law Enforcement Commission. </P>
<P>Five years ago, we started a weekly television show on Cable Television Network, the station that carries live coverage of the Legislature. The program appears Sundays at 11 a.m., as well as Mondays at 4 p.m. when the Legislature is not in session. Former Statehouse reporter Mary Caffrey anchors the program.</P>
<P>We made our first foray onto the web in 1996 and are upgrading our web site to make njreporter.org your first stop for news and research on public policy issues in New Jersey. Our website's "<a href="policyca.htm">Public Policy Calendar</a>" will be updated regularly, as will the "<a href="revolve.htm">Revolving Door</a>" and "<a href="policywonks.htm">For Policy Wonks Only</a>" features. We are in the process of putting all 23 years of our magazine on the web in a user-friendly format that will enable users to call up articles by subject, by author and through full-text-search.</P>
<P>We look forward to hearing from you. Please contact us:</P><DIR>
