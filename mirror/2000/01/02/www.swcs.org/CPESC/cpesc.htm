A certification program sponsored by the Soil and Water
Conservation Society and the International Erosion Control
Association</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Program Purposes</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The public demands evidence of professional
competence from persons whose activities affect the physical and
economic well being of people throughout the world. This need has
been recognized in such professions as medicine, law, and
engineering. Laws governing misuse of land and water resources
and damages inflicted on others by erosion and sediment have been
passed in many countries by their states and provinces. These
laws create a need for the services of professionals trained in
proper erosion and sediment control methods. Such professionals
increasingly must be able to show evidence of their
qualifications.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A certification program-identifying
professionals qualified for educational, scientific, and service
activities with public and private agencies in the erosion and
sediment field is in the public interest. Through the SWCS and
IECA, professionals in this field have developed standards and
procedures for certifying persons qualified in erosion and
sediment control. These pages explain the program, standards, and
procedures; contains a code of ethics for those professionals;
and includes an application for persons interested in
certification.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Certification</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Certification is based upon scholarly
preparation, knowledge, and experience. Professionals listed on
the registry will (a) meet the educational and practical
experience standards, (b) subscribe to the code of ethics, (c)
qualify for particular identification of special abilities, and
(d) pass a qualifying examination. A Certification Review
Committee (CRC) passes on the credentials of each applicant for
certification. All decisions of the CRC pertaining to eligibility
for certification and inclusion on the registry must be
considered final after due provision for an appeal.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>The CPESC Administrative Office is located
at the Soil and Water Conservation Society.</em></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Sponsors and endorsers</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Soil and Water Conservation Society, a
nonprofit scientific and educational organization, is widely
recognized and respected as an effective advocate for the
conservation of soil, water, and related natural resources and
the environment these resources support. As one of its
objectives, SWCS strives to improve the professional competency
of its members so that land and water resources left to future
generations will be at least as abundant and productive as they
are today. As part of this objective, SWCS administers this
voluntary certification program to recognize the education and
experience of individuals who have attained the designation of
Certified Professional in Erosion and Sediment Control. SWCS and
its chapters offer continuing education that can help applicants
achieve and maintain certification.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The International Erosion control Association
(IECA) is a nonprofit, member organization dedicated to providing
resource information for a broad spectrum of erosion and sediment
control topics. IECA is a sponsor of the CPESC program and offers
specialized training that can assist applicants in achieving
certification. Once certification has been achieved, IECA can
help CPESC&#146;s keep their skills sharp and meet continuing
education requirements through it annual conference and trade
exposition, professional development training courses, and other
useful resources.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The United States Department of Agriculture
Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an agency of the
U.S federal government charged with providing erosion and
sediment control assistance to citizens and corporations,
endorses the CPESC program. As an endorser, NRCS recommends that
qualified employees pursue the CPESC designation.</font></p>
