<p>News Release&nbsp; </p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">

<p>February is open enrollment month; register your kindergartner at your neighborhood
school in March </p>
</font></b>

<p><strong>To locate your child's residence school, consult the <a
href="http://www.wccusd.k12.ca.us/resdir.htm">Resident School Directory.</a></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are you interested in having your child attend a school other than your
neighborhood school? If so, you may apply for an intradistrict transfer through the month
of February. Applications have been given to every 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup>
grade student in the District. You may also pick up an application from any school. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mail your application to: WCCUSD Transfer Office, 157 - 9th Street,
Room 108, Richmond, CA 94801, during the entire month of February. Or you can drop it off
at the above address, except for the week of February 15-19, when the school district is
closed for Winter Break. Completed applications are not accepted at the schools. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">School Board policy permits student transfers as long as there is space
available at the requested school. Before approving any transfer, the Transfer Office must
also determine that the transfer does not cause the requested school to become racially
imbalanced. For more information, contact the WCCUSD Transfer Office at (510) 620-2273.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">March 1-31 is <b>kindergarten registration period</b> in the West
Contra Costa Unified School District. If your child turns five years old on or before
December 2, 1999, he or she is eligible to register for kindergarten at your local
neighborhood school for next fall. The tentative date for the first day of school for the
1999-2000 school year is September 1, 1999.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Register your child at your neighborhood school (sometimes called the
school of residence) from 9:00 a.m. to 12 noon, or 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. on school days during
March. Call your neighborhood school for more information; expanded registration hours may
be offered. Most schools will offer a.m. and p.m. kindergarten sessions; please indicate
which session you prefer when you register.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To register your child for kindergarten, bring the following papers to
your neighborhood school: </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Proof of age, such as a birth certificate or baptismal record.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. Proof of immunizations.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. Proof of residence, such as a current PG&amp;E bill. Telephone bills
are not accepted as proof of residence.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Immunizations are available at the Richmond Public Health Department
Immunization Clinic, which is located on the first floor at 39th Street and Bissell
Avenue. The clinic is open 2:00-4:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. Immunizations are free
for children 5 years old and younger.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a $7 fee per child for children 6 or older; there is a family
fee of $13 for immunizations for more than two children. TB tests are $10 per adult or
child. Call (510) 374-3101 for more information.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The month of March is also the transfer period for children entering
kindergarten. Fill out a transfer application at the same time you register your child and
mail or bring the completed transfer application to the Transfer Office.</p>
