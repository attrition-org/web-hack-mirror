<p><font face="Palatino">Today we know that children can learn to
be good readers by listening to literature, discussing
literature, reading literature and writing about it. When
learning happens in a meaningful and integrated manner, children
acquire skills because they are truly needed for communication.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino">With the integrated method, teachers
provide many opportunities for children to experience a variety
of wonderful literature that is our heritage. Teachers read to
students, offering a model of skillful oral reading, while
whetting their appetite for good stories. They provide many kinds
of books in the classrooms. Many classrooms have reading corners
for quiet reading, writing centers that include materials for
illustrating books, and areas for making and staging plays.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino">Children will be taught strategies for
decoding words, in a variety of meaningful contexts. Students
will attain a basic sight vocabulary and an enriched vocabulary
as they explore the great world of literature. Students learn the
conventions of the English language, including correct usage,
grammatical correctness, spelling, punctuation, and
capitalization, through listening, speaking, reading and writing
and through direct instruction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino">Parents and teachers have always been
interested in helping children to read; now they can help them
explore literature. The reading ability of children improves when
they learn to be good listeners and thinkers in both home and
school discussion. Their self-esteem increases when they know
adults listen to and value their opinions and ideas. Reading to
children plants the seeds of love for reading. Trips to the
library and checking out books are extremely worthwhile. Children
copy their parents when they see them reading. Parents and
teachers who love to read books are role models for children who
are successful in reading and learning language skills. Parents
and teachers want children to view reading as a pleasurable
activity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino"><b>Overview:</b> Kindergarten students
will develop an interest in an enjoyment of reading by paying
attention to stories read to them, telling a story, watching as
it is written down and listening as their stories are read aloud.
They will also learn to handle a book appropriately. A rich
spoken language experience will help children learn new
vocabulary. Students will have experiences that encourage
self-expression.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino"><b>Overview:</b> The primary curriculum
builds on what young children already know when they begin
kindergarten. They have developed important understandings of
space, time, cause, and effect. These connect the child to his or
her world. Children begin to see the world as orderly,
rule-governed, and predictive. In primary grades, children begin
to study geography and history through literature and primary
source documents but these are always connected to the child's
space and time. Each year, through the grades studies begin with
the immediate present and move on to develop links with the
larger geographic and economic world. Each year children study
people and events from the past to build sensitivity and
appreciation for contributions which affect their lives today.
Multicultural education plays a major role in the curriculum.</font></p>
