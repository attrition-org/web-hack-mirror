	The time has come. The newest turn of the century is upon us. More and more
people are overcomed by garbage and gossip and more and more hackers / newbies
are overcomed by useful underground information that will take forth a new breed
of crackers and phreakers and hackers and digital terrorists upon the new millenium.
Many say its the revelations. Many say its the end. But many don't understand
that this is only the beginning. Knowledge is power. At least some of it is. You 
don't need to be a genius to understand how to make black powder or a pipe bomb.
You don't need to be a genius to pull a trigger either. But, all these nifty little
thingamajiggaroos are useless and pointless without a sense of direction, a sense
of creativity, and a sense of knowing when to quit. Every day the werld tries to take
away more and more of us. Yet everyday, more and more of us are born. Some even reborn.
We are here and we aren't going anywhere as long as the world continues on insisting on
technology to do their derty werk. We know alot of yu computer geek fags are getting paid
$1500 an hour to give "technical support" for this y2k bullshit...but for $1500 hell...we might
as well give yu somethin to keep you busy and try to earn a little bit of that filthy money
that yur leeching off of our tax0r d0ll0rs. So with just a little bit of my usual ramblings...

hey everyone...<br>
this might seem like somewhat of a shock, but it isnt.  This is vent, --- former --- Level Seven Co-president... from the Level Seven Crew.  As all of you might have found out, or thought over the last few months.... i WAS raided, and yes, there is no more Level Seven Crew.
I have had the recent oppertunity to write this notice, along with the defacements of my good friend acidclown... i am using this oppertunity to prnounce the end of Level Seven (L7)... because due to my recent raid, along with the other members... we have quit the hacking scene, due to the many ....MANY problems it has caused in my, and the other members' lives.
Level Seven Was raided October 5th, 1999, nearly 4 months now.   Since that time, we have gone to court, and been charged with many different things, which i am not going to get into.  The way we got raided, doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out...   The FBI, notified local police that we resided somewhere in the area we live in, then when the local cops found the defaced ramada inn, and CRAK, a former member of L7 which is still being searched for to kill, (litterally) ratted us out... the local cops notified the FBI, and the local cops called us down thinking we were in trouble for just the Ramada Inn incident.
Anywho, Level Seven is DEAD.  There will be no more defacements made by us, there will be no more mail answered by us, there will be no more communication along hacked pages by us any longer.. this is the end, along with the new millenium, comes a new life for us, a new time for us to believe in different things, and different issues....
I wish you all a Happy New Year, and a happy life.. i would like to thank acidklown for this oppertunity to speak to the public...and the people who believed in us, and what we did.
    - vent</center>
