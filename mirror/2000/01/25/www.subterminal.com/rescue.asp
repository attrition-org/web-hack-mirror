    Is your company website sick? Is it out-of-control, unorganized, hopelessly out-of-date? Does it just not look as clean and professional as your company and image deserve? Protect your company's image, clean up your information and improve your on-line presence with our site rescue services.<br>
    
    <br>
    <strong>Why Redesign?</strong><br>
    Our culture is changing rapidly as access to and use of the Internet become more pervasive. For increasing numbers of people around the world, instant access to information and choices has become not only a reality, but a given. Website addresses pervade the media, and it is now nearly a self-understood fact that a serious business has a presence on the web. Two years ago, the web was cutting-edge. Now, any large business without a website is almost a curiosity.<br>
    <br>
    Easy web creation tools and templates help many businesses get started. But in an increasing number of fields, it is no longer enough simply to have a website. To be taken seriously, the site must be good. It must provide users with a reason to come, to stay and to return. It has to fit the company image- to compliment existing <a href="brands.asp" target="main" class="linknorm">brand</a>, marketing and promotional efforts. It has to look professional and offer something- information, contacts, product or service news, support, a store front- something to impress an audience that enters and leaves with their impressions in minutes.

    <strong>Critical Impressions</strong><br>
    Users don't want to search too hard to find your site, and when they get there, their first impression must be good, or they will never return. If they come and your site is professional and easy to use, you may win their business. But if they come and see an outdated, amateur site- particularly if it doesn't match the caliber of your other promotional efforts- in mere seconds, your site may destroy the <a href="brands.asp" target="main" class="linknorm">professional impression</a> you have worked so hard to create.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Rescue &amp; Enhancements</strong><br>
    Subterminal.com specializes in professional website re-design and construction. Let us help take the worry out of your electronic business front and give you a high-end site design worthy of your good business name. Advertising and marketing are critical to business success, and most successful businesses spend a good deal of time and effort creating a public impression. Many go to great lengths and spend a lot of money on printed promotional materials, TV ads and radio. But when it comes to the internet, too often a company's first (or second, or third) website does not get the same attention to professionalism and detail as other marketing efforts.<br>
