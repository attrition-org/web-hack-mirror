    A critical, yet often overlooked phase of the website development process is the Strategy and Goal-setting phase. We can help your site be more successful by walking you through the strategy process and helping you answer some important questions about what to expect from your site. We help define site goals and measurables and offer ways to track progress. We also offer full site implementation, including <a href="design.asp" class="linknorm" target="main">site building</a>, promotion, cross-marketing and advocacy. If needed, we offer tracking services, strategy refinement and re-assessments to ensure your site adapts to the rapidly changing business terrain of the Internet.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Why do <em>you</em> need a website?</strong><br>
    Far too often, in the mad rush to get on the web, this question goes unanswered. Worse still, the question may never get asked. Because no clear direction is set from the beginning, many company websites flounder; they grow stale because no one planned for updates, they run up enormous costs in development and time because no clear measurables or expected returns have been discussed, and no life-cycles or phases have been mapped out.
