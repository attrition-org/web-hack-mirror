<p><font face="Tahoma"><a href="http://www.ontla.on.ca/Documents/archives/Journals/bills/G96081e.htm" target="_blank">The Fewer Politicians Act (Bill 81)</a> came into force January 1, 1997.
This Act fullfills a campaign promise to introduce new ridings which mirror the federal
electorial boundries. This means that the number of ridings are reduced from 130 to 103.
My riding of Carleton will be split in half and merged into to neighbouring ridings to
make up Lanark Carleton and Nepean Carleton.&nbsp; I have provided two maps of the new
ridings that once made up Carleton. I have been re-elected&nbsp; in the riding of
Lanark Carleton so for those of you residing in the new riding of Nepean Carleton thank
you for your many years of support.&nbsp; </font></p>
