    <td width="55%"><font face="System">The history of KK Women's and Children's Hospital
    (KKH) traces back to 1924, when the former Kandang Kerbau Hospital began its operation as
    the only medical facility in Singapore to specialise in Obstetrics and Gynaecology and
    Neonatology. To<br>
    date, more than 1.2 million babies or one third of the nation&#146;s population, were
    delivered at the Hospital.</font><p><font face="System">The old Hospital, known fondly
    among Singaporeans simply as &quot;KK&quot;, had its share of historical moments. In 1966,
    the Hospital earned a place in The Guinness Book of Records for delivering the
    world&#146;s largest number of babies in a single medical facility. In 1983, it witnessed
    the delivery of the first test tube baby in Asia. The Hospital had also played a pivotal
    role in the training of obstetricians and gynaecologists in Singapore.</font></td>

    <td width="45%"><font face="System">In 1989, the concept for a new women&#146;s hospital
    was approved by the government. As a natural extension of the specialised care that the
    Hospital was already providing for women and new-borns, it was decided that the new
    facility will incorporate a hospital dedicated to the medical needs of children.The
    paediatric services offered at the Singapore General Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital and
    Alexandra Hospital were to be centralised at the first purpose-built Children&#146;s
    Hospital in Singapore.<br>
    <br>
    The new 898-bed KK Women's and Children's Hospital was completed in 1997. The Women&#146;s
    Hospital was opened on 10 March 97, following its move from the former premises at 1
    Hampshire Road. The Children&#146;s Hospital admitted its first patient two months later.</font></td>

    <td width="55%"><font face="System">The opening of the new KK Women's and Children's
    Hospital marked a significant milestone in Singapore&#146;s history of medical care. The
    integration of the Hospital&#146;s core disciplines in Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology,
    Neonatology and Paediatrics will enable the Hospital to channel its resources optimally to
    meet the health care needs of women, babies and children.<br>
    <br>
    As a teaching hospital, KKH is also committed to the training of doctors and nurses
    specialising in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Neonatology and Paediatrics. It is also
    committed to build a conducive environment for medical research to flourish.</font></td>
