<Br>
It's been a few issues since I last saw something from Paul Wood of Ensign Historical Miniatures, and as usual it was due to him being rather busy. This issue though I was lucky enough to receive details of Paul's latest release, plus something else he's now doing.<bR>
<Br>
The latest figure release is a mounted King Charles I which, as I've come to expect from Paul, is very well-sculpted and painted. Ensign is known for its traditional toy style, and I'd say the firm is one of the best, along with companies such as Trophy. This figure is certainly no exception and comes with beautiful bright, bold colors. Although gloss finish isn't my personal favorite, I would gladly have this figure in my collection as it is so well-produced and certainly more of a model than a toy.<bR>
<Br>
The other interesting new area Paul has moved into is vehicles, but don't misunderstand me he isn't making them, just retailing them. The tanks are made in China by Toy Mark. Although they are very &quot;toy&quot; in style, they still work really well as models to go with 54 mm figures. And they are very reasonably priced in comparison to many of the handmade models on the market.<bR>
<Br>
Toy Mark produces four different tanks: two versions of a Sherman M4A3 with varying markings and slightly different shades of green, each with one plastic figure; and two versions of a King Tiger in either sand or gray camouflage, both with three figures.<bR>
<Br>
For more details on either the new figure or the tanks, contact Ensign, see page 43 for its address.<bR>

Caption Correction<bR>
<Br>
Last issue many of you spotted the error in the article &quot;Passion of a Lifetime.&quot; In fact, there were three small caption errors in the article. The captions for the paintings of the Zouave and the grenadier were reversed. Also, the set of figures captioned as the French sacramental procession were in fact made by Graham Farish (with a few Courteney figures) and were produced in 1953 for the Coronation of current Queen.<bR>
<Br>
The Finest name change<bR>
<Br>
Last issue in my review of the Britains Waterloo set, I mentioned the departure of Richard Walker, Britains' U.S. product manager. Richard left Britains to begin work on his own range with collector Richard Conte and sculptor Ken Osen. They were originally going to call the company Finest Hour, however, this has changed and the company is now known as Conte Collectibles.<bR>
<Br>
Conte Collectibles is now into the production of its first releases, which are to be shown for the first time at this year's Chicago show. However, I have been lucky enough to get a few early pictures of some of the pieces that will make their debut at Chicago.<bR>
<Br>
As I mentioned last issue there are two sides to the business, the first is &quot;Fields of Glory,&quot; and under this brand name we will see the release of figures and playsets with a historical background such as the American Civil War and Zulu War.<bR>
<Br>
The other side to the company is &quot;Legends of the Silver Screen.&quot; Under this name will come the release of movie-related figures and playsets. In production at present are figures and accessories based around the films &quot;The Warlord,&quot;  &quot;Beau Geste&quot; and &quot;Zulu.&quot; These will be closely followed by pieces based on &quot;Spartacus,&quot; &quot;The Longest Day&quot; and &quot;The Vikings.&quot;<bR>
<Br>
So far I have only seen photographs of early prototypes (shown here), but from looking at these I think we're in for a real treat when the finished items hit the shops later this year. The thing that has most impressed me with this company is the fact that it plans to produce all of the sets in both a connoisseur metal finish and as plastic playsets, therefore catering to all collectors.<bR>
<Br>
To learn more about this exciting new range, see the Conte Collectibles advertisements on pages 11, 26 and 27, attend the Old Toy Soldier 's 19th annual show in Chicago on Sept. 26, or keep your eyes peeled for a more in-depth review in this magazine after the show.<bR>

It's not unusual for me to get phone calls from new companies just starting out in the hobby, and that was the case this issue. The company that got in touch was J&amp;L Miniatures from Devon. I had never heard of it before. It specializes in toy soldiers of British India. The masters for the figures are made by well-known sculptor Alan Caton.<bR>
<Br>
The figures are well-made and come painted in a traditional toy gloss style. The two sets that I received were a walking mule carrying a machine gun and ammo boxes, and a blacksmith set. Both sets are really well-done, but I prefer the blacksmith piece as it's a little more unusual. However, saying this I feel there are a couple of minor points with this set that let it down slightly. First, this mule casting is obviously used for both sets. Unfortunately, because of this, the blacksmith set's mule has small holes in its back where, on the other set, the machine gun fits. Also a leg that is bent at the knee appears to bend too low down the leg, although this is a very minor point.<bR>
<Br>
Overall both of these sets are very good and well-priced for the quality. For more information on J&amp;L, see its advertisement on page 48.<bR>

Britains Fly-by<bR>
<Br>
Now that things have settled down at Britains after the recent take-over, the UK team have been in touch with some eagerly awaited releases. You may remember from issue 20 that Rob Hendrie reviewed the Sopwith Camel, and I have been waiting ever since to see the Fokker which was due to be released shortly after. Unfortunately due to packaging problems and no doubt all the upheaval, the Fokker was greatly delayed, but finally I have seen one and now the question is, &quot;was it worth the wait?&quot;<bR>
<Br>
To answer this question in the simplest form would be to say, &quot;yes&quot;, although it still has a few down points. Overall, like the Sopwith, the Fokker is very well made and a model I would happily have in my cabinet. The main features I dislike, as did Rob with the Sopwith, are the prominence of the wing ribs and the slightly oversized bracing. <bR>
<Br>
The figures which accompany this model are Manfred von Richtofen (the Red Baron), hence the Fokkers striking paint job, and Lothair his faithful associate. The figures are also well sculpted and painted and of a much better quality than those of a few years ago. A minor quibble with the figures would be regarding the bases, as they are just not big enough, and Lothair has a distinctly forward lean.<bR>
<Br>
Overall the set is good and worth the £99 Britains are asking. I just hope they look a little closer at the minor details if they decide to release similar models.<bR>
<Br>
The other piece I decided to take a closer look at this issue is the new set (00170) &quot;Scots Greys duals 11<FONT  SIZE= 1 >th</FONT> Hussars.&quot; This is, I feel, one of the most aesthetically pleasing pieces I have seen Britains produce for a long time. The set was obviously well thought out and equally has been well put together. There isn't really much I can say except that I hope in next year's catalogue there are more pieces like this. But let's see them with metal bases. I say this because the only thing that detracts from the beauty of the metal figures is the rather plain looking resin base, but again overall the set is well made and very competitively priced (£39.99).<bR>
<Br>

PNF Return<bR>
<Br>
It's been quite a few issues since we featured something from the small Australian company PNF Figurines, and this has been due to them being so busy. They have now almost finished the large set which has kept them working and here you can see the first pieces. It is of course the Royal Marines band, and PNF have promised to forward the missing figures as soon as they are finished.<bR>
<Br>
The figures shown are a Drum Major, Conductor, Cymbals, Trumpeter, Tuba, Flute, Guard Officer and Guard (other rank). The figures as always for PNF are well put together and painted in a traditional toy gloss style, and with the Australian exchange rate being so good at present these really are worth looking at more closely. If I had to find a bad point with these figures it would be difficult, although the base from the knee to the foot is slightly narrow, but that's only if you look very closely.<bR>
<Br>
These are, as always, good figures and well worth the small investment. If you'd like more information contact PNF direct. Their address can be found on page 48.<bR>

A Spanish Classic<bR>
<Br>
Army House miniatures have featured rarely in the pages of this magazine simply due to keeping in touch with such a busy Spanish based company. This has changed, or at least for this issue, as they have sent me a number of pictures of their new mounted Spanish character figures. Probably the most easily recognised is &quot;El Cid&quot;.<bR>
<Br>
Dressed as he would have appeared trying to push the Moors back to Africa this figure has excellent detail. The painting is comparable to that emerging from some of the Russian studios and the sculpting is first class. Although the horse to me appears fairly stylised, especially in the head, there is still something about it that really made me look more closely.<bR>
<Br>
This figure is a good representation of the other pieces due for release, and I would suggest anyone with an interest in Spanish history talk to this company. Details on these new releases can be obtained direct from Army House, see their advertisement on page 18.<bR>

Competition Winner<bR>
<Br>
The lucky winner of the Ducal competition in issue 23 was Mr J P Mallard of Camborne in Cornwall. Congratulations to Mr Mallard and good luck to you all in this month's competition. If you turn to page 49 you could be in with a chance of winning a superb new release from Trophy Miniatures.<bR>

FormTech is a name more familiar to our American readers as they seem to have a presence &nbsp;at every US show, whereas here in the UK it's rare to see their products. Many UK readers should recognise the name though, as a number of bigger companies such as Britains have used FormTech pieces in their photographs and advertisements.<bR>
<Br>
FormTech produce the expanded foam scenic accessories which I mentioned for the first time a few months ago. Since then they appear to have gone from strength to strength and their range is increasing by the day. This fact is borne out by the box of items I received recently.<bR>
<Br>
Rather than trying to get everything into one issue, which to be honest would be impossible, I've decided to show it over a number of issues. The first pieces shown here are the new trench section for WWI/II and a Zulu hut. Both pieces are well sculpted and come in the usual light brown foam. They work okay unpainted but obviously a touch of paint here and there can really help bring them to life. As scenic items go these are excellent value for money, but a little more work is needed than with some other manufacturers.<bR>
<Br>
For further details on either of these new pieces contact Toy Soldiers of San Diego as they are acting as FormTech's agents, their address can be found on page 43.<bR>

A New Navy<bR>
<Br>
A quick mention this issue to the forthcoming release from King &amp; Country. Andy Neilson of the Hong Kong based company recently sent me a few transparencies of their new releases. Included were the new &quot;D-Day Yanks&quot; but as these are appearing on the back cover I didn't see a need to place them here.<bR>
<Br>
Of more interest to me were the new navy figures. There appears to be two versions; one current Royal Navy, which has an uncanny resemblance to a well-known member of the British Monarchy! The other is a portrait figure Nelson. Both figures are in King &amp; Country's recognisable style and appear very well made and painted with plenty of detail.<bR>
<Br>
For more information on these charming figures contact your local retailer or King &amp; Country direct.See the back cover for address information.<bR>

The Guard's Addition<bR>
<Br>
In issue 23 I featured some the first releases from the Guard Corps' new line of ACW figures and at the end of it I said &quot;I can't wait for more additions to this series&quot;, well I didn't have to wait long. This issue Allan was back in touch, excitedly chatting to me about the latest addition to the range, a Confederate Fife and Drum Corps.<bR>
<Br>
This set is equally as good as the others he produces as it accurately portrays the Fife and Drum Corps by using both boys and adults. All too often I find manufacturers stay away from areas such as this due to &quot;political correctness.&quot; Although I don't agree with casualty figures covered in red paint, I do think a sense of reality is needed, rather than this old practice by certain manufacturers to portray every soldier as being over the age of 30.<bR>
<Br>
This set as with the other previous releases comes in a traditional toy gloss finish and if you're interested in this conflict I would suggest taking a closer look at this range. For more information contact the Guard Corps at their usual address, which can be found on page 18.<bR>

JG's Ruin<bR>
<Br>
Now don't take my heading the wrong way JG Miniatures are still in business, the title actually applies to John's latest additions to his range, ruined buildings. As always with John's pieces they are excellent, highly detailed and a perfect background to WWI/II figures.<bR>
<Br>
Although John's scenic items are not the cheapest on the market, they certainly are some of the best. I would suggest anyone working on a WWI/II diorama should get in touch with John for details on these lovely new items. &nbsp;For further details contact your local retailer or JG Miniatures direct.<bR>
