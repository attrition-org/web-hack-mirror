Loved the slide show!  A most impressive web site, should encourage people like me to come and visit your beautiful town and amazing scenery.  I hope all the locals add their special event photos to the album, perhaps a few captions could be included indicating the names/ages/backround info. on the people in the pictures.  More Bamfield historical information would be appreciated too.  It's been an extraordinary priviledge to spend some time in your paradise by the ocean - thank you!

Hi. I hope this is more legible at your end than at mine.

I would like to learn more about your town, and am considering moving to your part of the world.

If you can read this,, please send me an email address where I could ask some questions about Bamfield and about the surrounding area,.

Best Regards,

Steve and Bobbie Mildenberger

Hi again.  I see it is only the font in the comment box that is funny, and that my message was legible after it was sent.  So here are a couple questions.

Is there a real estate agent who sells land in Bamfield?  It looks beautiful from the slied show, and I would imagine that very few people are wanting to sell houses or land.

Where are the nearest medical facilities (clinic, hospital)?  Is there a doctor resident in Bamfield?

What is the weather like in the winter?  How much of the year is 'shirtsleeve weather'?

We really like the web site.  Keep working on some moreof the links.  I will come back and visit it often.

Best Regards,

Steve and Bobbie Mildenberger

HI I'm good friend of Tina Charles, if who ever reading this knows her.  Her dad runs the Coast guard in Bamfield.  I was up there last summer a few times staying at Pachena Bay, and I have to say that Bamfield is the most beautiful place on earth.  Every time that I come up there it is so hard to leave. anyhoo, see ya.

We visited Bamfield in July, 1992 for about 2 hours aboard the Lady Rose.  We've been waiting 7 years 
to get back and spend much more time.  See you in June.

Hi I was there in March with Mrs Howard, it was a lot of fun and I sure liked the boat ride. But the only thing that I think is that it was a lab that a meal, a lab then a meal, a lab then a meal and sooooo on. You wouldn't even get to bed till about 10:00pm than you had to wake up at 6:00am or so and take a shower before Breakfast, all I am saying is you get too tired.

Beautiful web page!  It is very informative about your community; however, we were unable to find any information about the fishing derby that takes place at Bamfield (dates etc.).  Thus, perhaps, a link site to event information of this sort may be a welcome addition to the web page.  
We &amp; our family have visited, fished, &amp; loved Bamfield in the past, and we recommend all tourists &amp; residents of our province to visit Bamfield.
