Commands</a>, <a href="chatbox.htm#moderator">Moderator Commands</a></small></p>

<p align="left"><a name="connecting"></a><strong>How to connect:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;
click <a href="../Chatroom/lcht.htm">here</a> to launch the chat program, and then follow these
instructions.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the program loads, click
in the box located in the top right corner where it says YourName.&nbsp; Delete that text,
and replace it with an alias, or nickname you want to be referred to as.&nbsp; Now click
the Connect button in the top left area of the window.&nbsp; It should say after a short
time say &quot;Now talking in Channel #BamfieldChat&quot;.&nbsp; You are now connected and
in the chat channel.&nbsp; On the left of your chat window you will see a vertical
rectangular box with your alias in it.&nbsp; If there are no other names in this box, you
are the only one in the channel.&nbsp; Relax, your either early or you aren't planning on
meeting anyone.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="basiccommands"></a><strong>Basic Chat Commands: </strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>NOTE: when typing commands do not include the &quot;&lt;&quot; and
&quot;&gt;&quot; that are in the examples, these simply mean &quot;replace this
with&quot;.</strong></p>

<p align="left">Here are the most Basic commands you have to know to start chatting : <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; All commands in Internet Relay Chat begin with a &quot;/&quot;.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; To &quot;talk&quot; in IRC, type anything without a &quot;/&quot; at the
beginning. </p>

<p align="left">To execute commands, type them in the text box at the bottom of the
window.<br>
<br>
First,<small> </small><strong>DO NOT TYPE<big> </big></strong>/help, for some reason this
program will crash and you will have to reload if you type this command.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>/nick</strong> <br>
Allows you to change your nickname.&nbsp; Example: /nick Ben would change your name to
Ben.<br>
<br>
<strong>/list</strong> <br>
This will list ALL the available channels.&nbsp; NOTE: Most servers would produce a *very
lengthy* list but ours is fairly low-key and located in Denmark (I believe).</p>

<p align="left"><strong>/join</strong> #channel name (for example /join #mychannel) <br>
If you want to join one of the other channels on the server, use this.&nbsp; NOTE: We do
not own this server, it is free for our use.&nbsp; So all 99% of the people in other
channels will not be related to this sites content or purpose.&nbsp; If you want to split
a discussion or move your discussion once all the members have arrived, type /join
#&lt;whatever_you_want&gt; and make your own channel.&nbsp; Then invite the other people
into it by sending individual messages (/msg &lt;user&gt; &lt;message&gt;) to each, or by
notifying the entire channel (/notify #&lt;channel&gt; &lt;message&gt;).</p>

<p align="left"><strong>/whois</strong> &lt;nickname&gt;<br>
Give some specific information about a particular person (hostmark, server used...) <br>
<br>
<strong>/msg</strong> &lt;nickname&gt; &lt;message&gt;<br>
Sends a private message to another person</p>

<p align="left">|#,#<br>
Sets the color of text, Example: |4,0<font color="#FF0000">Hello. </font><font color="#000000">(| is the character above \ )</font></p>

<p align="left"><strong>/wake</strong> &lt;nickname&gt;<br>
Tries to get a users attention by playing a sound on their computer.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>/ignore</strong> &lt;nickname&gt;<br>
Does not display text sent from &lt;nickname&gt;.&nbsp; To take off ignore, simply perform
the command again.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>/ping</strong> &lt;nickname&gt;<br>
Displays the amount of time it takes for a message to reach &lt;nickname&gt;</p>

<p align="left"><strong>/opass</strong> &lt;password&gt;<br>
Obtain operator status.&nbsp; This is only available to the persons who register the
channel.&nbsp; In this case us.&nbsp; However if you want to permanently create your own
channel, you can do it from the <a href="http://www.leahcim.com">www.leahcim.com</a> page.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Moderator Commands (Channel Operator):</strong></p>

<p align="left">The moderator(s) or channel operator(s) of a channel have special powers
over what goes on the channel and its members.&nbsp; Channel operators are denoted by an @
symbol in front of their nickname in the nickname listing window (Note: the @ symbol isn't
included when writing private /msg 's to such individuals).&nbsp; <strong>The first person
to enter a channel automatically becomes the channel operator.</strong>&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left"><strong>/topic</strong> &lt;What ever you could possibly want&gt;<br>
Lets you set a topic for the channel, this text will scroll along the top of the window
for everyone connected to the channel.&nbsp; It will also be displayed to people who do a
/list command.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>/kick</strong> &lt;nickname&gt;<br>
Allows you to boot unwanted or unruly members of the conversation our of the channel.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>/OP</strong> &lt;nickname&gt;<br>
Gives operator status to another member of the channel</p>

<p align="left"><strong>/DEOP</strong> &lt;nickname&gt;<br>
Removes operator status from another member of the channel</p>
