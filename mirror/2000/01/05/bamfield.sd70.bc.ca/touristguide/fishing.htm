<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bamfield&#146;s quick
access to the sparkling waters of Barkley Sound make this small coastal community an
angler&#146;s paradise. Some of the most spectacular fishing in the world is within
minutes of the harbour. Hang out at the local docks, café, or pub and you&#146;ll hear
names like Whittlestone, Cape Beale, Edward King, Sanford, and Kirby Point bantered around
like they are what makes the world turn. Being there when the bite is on, whether
it&#146;s for a few minutes or a few hours, whether you&#146;ve come a thousand miles or
live a few minutes away, whether you&#146;ve fished for 50 years or five minutes, is what
fishing fantasies are made of. The only secret, I&#146;m told, is to know just when and
where the bite will be.</i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Salmon Fishery</p>
</b></font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it&#146;s the pride
of landing a big trophy spring salmon; the ecstasy of tasting fresh barbecued sockeye, or
the adrenaline rush of fighting a skyrocketing coho, you won&#146;t be disappointed with a
fishing trip to Bamfield. </p>
<font FACE="Gill Sans Condensed" SIZE="4"><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="Springs"></a>Spring Salmon</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every spring, the big spring salmon make their way down the coast; they
travel from the Charlottes in late June, to Nootka Sound in late July, reaching Bamfield
by late August. The average late summer catch is 15 to 20 pounds. Tyees over 30 pounds are
caught daily by late August, with the luckiest of anglers landing fish over 50 pounds.
Responsible angling means giving small fish a chance to survive &#150; please release
springs under 10 pounds.</p>
<font FACE="Gill Sans Condensed" SIZE="4"><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="Coho"></a>Coho</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By September, the voraciously feeding coho will reach 15 pounds. Until
then, catches of 3-10 pounds are common. This smaller species are known for their strength
and are the ultimate fighting fish. Unfortunately, effective June 1/98 fishing for Cho is
prohibited for the season.</p>
<font FACE="Gill Sans Condensed" SIZE="4"><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="Sockeye"></a>Sockeye</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Look for sockeye in late June and early July; they reach up to 10
pounds. The bright red flesh of this fish is the most delicious of the salmon species. Try
it barbecued or canned. </p>
<font FACE="Gill Sans Condensed" SIZE="4"><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="Wintersprings"></a>Winter Springs</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The winter run of spring salmon is one of Bamfield&#146;s best kept
secrets. The fish follow the schools of herring and squid into Barkley Sound from out at
sea. This happens every March, and you can bet that a little rain and wind won&#146;t stop
the serious angler from the challenge of a big spring.</p>
<font FACE="Gill Sans Condensed" SIZE="6"><b>

<p><a name="Halibut"></a>Halibut Fishery</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The firm white meat of the halibut is
another local treasure. Fish and chips take on new meaning after you&#146;ve tried fresh
caught halibut. Ask for it at the local restaurants, or try fishing for it yourself.
Fishing for halibut is an adventure in itself! Halibut grounds are twenty miles offshore
(make sure your boat is equipped for offshore travel). You&#146;ll need a large lure to
jig for halibut, usually in water up to 250 feet deep. The thrill of halibut fishing is
that you just never know how big a fish will take your lure. Until the fight begins, you
won&#146;t know if its 20 pounds, or 100! Be prepared though, 100 pound halibut are
brought in </p>
<font FACE="Gill Sans Condensed" SIZE="6"><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="Freshwater"></a>Fresh Water Fishery</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you&#146;re not into
salt, or just want a change of breathtaking scenery, try the freshwater fishery. There are
three good rivers near Bamfield, all with the streams and pools that are home to trout and
steelhead, and a multitude of small lakes including Pachena, Frederickson, and Sarita.
Nitinat is the biggest lake in the area and its tidal waters team with fish (it&#146;s
also a wind surfers dream!)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local freshwater anglers walk through the timber to reach the best
river locations, and then use waders or floatation to walk the rivers looking for the
quiet pools that trout and steelhead call home. Use salmon roe, lures, or worms and bring
lady luck. However many fish come your way, you can count on a memorable outdoor
adventure.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="Cod"></a><font FACE="Gill Sans Condensed" SIZE="6"><b>Cod
Fishery</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around here the ling cod are
affectionately known as bucketheads (you just need to look at one to see why!). But
don&#146;t let the name deter you from the taste, it is a delicious fish any way you
prepare it. To catch one, use a hand jig, or rod and reel jig, and bounce a big old
silvery lure or hootchie on the bottom. (They keep to the various reefs.) </p>
