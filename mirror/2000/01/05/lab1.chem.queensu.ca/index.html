-----------------------------------------

Year 2000 has arrived as we wash away our past and start a brand new chapter. 
A new chapter in which we can learn from our past mistakes, stop war and 
make love.

The last 100 years (1900), had a history of war and hate crimes. 
As you know, World War I, World War II, Gulf Persian War etc...
Why were most of these war caused? Because of one little incident? 
Or a small disagreement like &quot;which way is better&quot;? Or because we don't
like their skin color? What ever the reason it seems stupid for a huge 
war in which serveral million people die. 

My great grandfather was killed by the Japanese soldiers in the war 
between China and Japan in the middle 1900s which killed lots of people
both Chinese and Japanese. My grandfather was only 8 years old, and at
that time children had to work to support the family. Education cost 
a lot in China (and it still is today). It wasn't easy back then.
Can you imagine yourself at 8 years old working for a living and not
knowing if your loved ones will die in the war the next day?

Why do we have this &quot;hate&quot; for people who have different skin color?
Is it their fault that they are born with their appearance? 
Why did the Nazis think that their race was superior than any others?
Perhaps the fact that they from German? Why kill people because of their
religion or backgroud? If people hated you for your appearance how 
would you feel? If you immigrated to another country and you couldn't
make a living because you are from a different country how might you 
feel?

We all shall work together not against and advance our civilization.
We are living in an age where technology is changing the world. Where
most work is automated by machines and computers. Where medicine is 
curing diseases that were uncurable before. Where we can get education 
for free. Where my cyber friends judge me by what I say not by my 
ethnic background or skin color. Too bad we just don't realize how lucky
we are sometimes. In this new day and age we can make a difference,
contribute to society and get rewarded.

So in this new millennium please stop sitting in front of your TV watching
comedy, movies, cartoons etc... And start to do something that will
contribute to your cause, your family's cause, the human race's cause etc... 
And please, don't judge people by their appearance it hurts.
Last but not least, remember that God and Jesus is with you through the 
bad times and the good times. 

Let the new chapter begin, let it begin with a rebirth of you 
and this world.

Greetings
Kristen: smart, intelligent, beautiful inside and out.
