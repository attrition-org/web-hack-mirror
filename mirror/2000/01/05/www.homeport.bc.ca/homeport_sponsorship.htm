<p>If you are considering establishing a web-site but don't know where to start, we can
help.&nbsp; The internet is proving to be a popular means of reaching potential customers
in Greater Vancouver, the Pacific NorthWest, and worldwide, but it, like other means of
reaching customers, must have a clear message, and must reach its target audience. &nbsp;
Simply posting some pages on an unknown site will generate little or no customer
traffic.&nbsp; Successful &quot;location&quot; on the internet requires proper page
design, registration with search engines, the development of links with other sites, and
proximity to other related sites.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your site, hosted by Homeport, will benefit from proximity to other marine-related
businesses on the site, by its affiliation with Scouting, and by the efforts of Scouts and
Venturers actively promoting the site through registration with search engines, and links
to other marine and Scouting related sites.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You gain exposure for your business on the internet while supporting Scouting youth in
your community.&nbsp; Homeport is marine industry oriented, giving you greater exposure on
the internet.&nbsp; You might think of it as a &quot;virtual marina&quot; where a variety
of marine oriented products and services are available at one site.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A website is maintained on a &quot;Web Server&quot;, which is a computer with&nbsp;
full-time access to the internet.&nbsp; A server can maintain multiple websites, each with
their own address and domain name.&nbsp; </p>

<p>If you already have a web-site, you can still benefit by a sponsoring a link at
homeport to your own site.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sponsorship of Scouting, with an annoted link to
your site is only $100 per year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For further information contact Scouter
<a href="mailto://rickr@ingenium-tech.com">Rick Rolston</a>. at (604) 482-8536.</p>
