    If you become a teacher, you will make a difference for the children you teach and the
    society they will build.</p>
    <p>If you become a teacher, you make a commitment to be a life-long learner yourself.</p>
    <p>Teaching is learning - about subject matter, about the art of teaching, about how we
    learn, about your students, about your community and about yourself.</p>
    <p>Teaching is also about exercising leadership and helping people. You will have the
    opportunity to help children learn, thrive and grow into productive members of their
    community. Teaching is a well-respected, rewarding, intellectually stimulating profession.
    Ontario teachers are respected at home and abroad. Many foreign schools are enthusiastic
    about hiring Ontario-trained teachers. Other jurisdictions recognize that Ontario teachers
    are professionals with exceptional qualifications.<br>
    <br>
    If you like working with children and young people, if you are by nature a curious and
    thoughtful person who enjoys learning challenges and helping others to learn, teaching is
    your career.</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

    <p>There&#146;s been a dramatic change in the job market for teachers. Over the last
    several years, many new teachers found it difficult to get a full-time teaching job in
    Ontario. But now the province&#146;s education system needs thousands of men and women to
    be elementary and secondary school teachers in all the academic and technological
    subjects. About half of Ontario&#146;s 170,000 teachers will retire by 2008. And there
    simply are not enough people graduating from Ontario&#146;s faculties of education to
    replace them.</p>

    <p>The best preparation for a career in teaching is a well-rounded education. Today&#146;s
    teachers need a solid grounding in the liberal arts, mathematics and science. Elementary
    students now study many math and science concepts that used to be taught in high school -
    and elementary teachers need to be prepared to teach them.</p>
    <p>Today&#146;s teachers must be able to use computers and a wide range of learning
    technologies themselves, and be able to help students fully understand and make the most
    of these resources.</p>
    <p><strong><em>&quot;The complexity of the demands made upon teachers in modern schools
    requires that all teachers should possess a level of research literacy. Teachers need to
    be informed consumers of research. As well as being active researchers themselves... . The
    independent professional is a critical consumer of research.</em></strong><br>

    <p>To teach Kindergarten to Grade 6, you will need to complete an undergraduate degree and
    your Bachelor of Education (BEd) or equivalent. For Grades 7 and 8, you will need to be
    qualified as an expert in one subject. To teach high school, you must be qualified to
    teach two subjects. If you&#146;re not sure whether you want to teach at the elementary or
    secondary level, take a variety of courses. You will have enough time to specialize in
    university.</p>
    <p>Teachers who graduate from BEd programs at Ontario universities are much sought after
    by schools in the province and around the world. Admission to Ontario faculties of
    education is limited - you will need very good marks to get in.</p>
    <p>Doing volunteer work with children is an excellent way to help you prepare for
    teaching. Although it is not a requirement, it may help you gain admission to a faculty of
    education. Try your hand at tutoring or working with children or young people through
    school, community or religious programs. It will also help you discover whether you like
    to work with youngsters.</p>
    <p>After you&#146;ve successfully completed the teacher training program, your final step
    to your career in teaching is to become a member of the Ontario College of Teachers.</p>

    <p>In university, you&#146;ll choose to specialize in one or two subjects from the
    elementary curriculum like English, history, science or math. A course in psychology,

    classroom.</p>

    <p>Many of the qualifications are the same whether you teach in elementary or secondary

    <p>As a high school academic teacher, you will need to be qualified to teach two academic
    subjects. This means that you should choose accordingly in your university majors.</p>
    <p>Take English and history, for example, or music and mathematics, or mathematics and
    science. If you think you would eventually like to be a specialist department head or
    principal, you may want to consider taking an honours degree.</p>

    subjects</strong></font><font size="3"></p>
    <p>To teach technological subjects - communications, construction, hospitality services,
    manufacturing, personal services, design, transportation - you do not have to have an
    undergraduate degree. You must have experience and proven competence in your field.</p>
    <p>You need a secondary school diploma, five years of work experience in the technology
    subject area and the one-year teacher education program. You may also enter the teacher
    training program with less work experience if you have a combination of experience and
    post-secondary education related to the field. You could pursue this post-secondary
    education at either a college of applied arts and technology or a university.</p>

    <p>Whether you&#146;re preparing to become a teacher immediately after you finish your
    formal education, or whether you&#146;re preparing to become a teacher after you&#146;ve
    been in the working world for five or 15 years, working with children and adolescents as a
    volunteer is a plus. In fact, it&#146;s often their volunteer work as youth group leaders
    or sports coaches that prompts people working in a technological field to realize
    they&#146;d like to make teaching their career.</p>
    <p>If you have the experience and the interest, contact one of the faculties of education
    that prepares future teachers of technological subjects. Brock University, Queen&#146;s
    University, University of Ottawa, University of Western Ontario and the Ontario Institute
    for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto offer these programs - you can find
    their addresses in the list of faculties of education in this brochure.</p>

    <p>If you received your teacher training outside Ontario, the College of Teachers will
    evaluate your credentials to ensure that you have education, training and experience
    equivalent to that required in Ontario. If you do, and are fluent in either English or
    French, you can be licensed to teach in Ontario.</p>
    <p>If your qualifications do not meet Ontario standards, the College will advise you how
    to acquire additional qualifications, usually at an Ontario faculty of education.</p>
    <p>To apply for membership in the College and a licence to teach in Ontario, contact the
    College of Teachers and ask for the Registration Guide for Teachers Trained Outside
