    Minister Janet Ecker <br>
    Address to Council</strong></font><p><font face="Book Antiqua">Nov. 18, 1999</font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Thank you very much to you Chair and my apologies for being
    late today, I was participating in my daily testing program at Queen&#146;s Park and
    sometimes that runs over a little late in Question Period and the Chair and I were just
    talking outside about being on the firing line. We have a lot in common these days on
    those kinds of issues but I really appreciate the invitation to be here and to join you at
    your Council meeting and have an opportunity to talk directly to you. And many of you I
    had met in the past and I am sure I&#146;m going to have &#150; is the Sun ready, is it
    working? Good, okay. We want to make sure the Fourth Estate has got every thing in order
    here too &#150; and I know I&#146;ll have many opportunities in the future to meet many
    more of you that I haven&#146;t met before.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">I&#146;ve had the opportunity, first in August, to meet with
    your Chair, with your Vice-Chair and the other senior staff at the College as we discussed
    a lot of issues of very much mutual interest and it was an opportunity for me to
    familiarize myself with the College&#146;s work over the past three years --of which there
    is an awful lot that you&#146;ve done -- and I&#146;ve been very impressed with the scope
    and the caliber of the work that you&#146;ve been wrestling with, the work that&#146;s
    been done both by staff and by Council members. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Earlier this week, I had another opportunity to meet with
    Donna Marie and John and once again we had what Premier Davis used to call full and frank
    discussions and they were very, very helpful as we move along on a lot of policy issues
    that are certainly of interest to you today. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">As the first governing Council of the College of Teachers,
    you play a very crucial role in maintaining and in improving the quality of teaching and
    enhancing learning in our province. I know that you&#146;ve done a lot of hard work to
    meet that mandate and to try and build a solid foundation as a self-funding independent
    professional body. And I recognize one of the things from the time I spent at the College
    of Physicians and Surgeons and I certainly know and appreciate the commitment and the
    dedication not only of the professional members, the teachers here in the room, but also
    the public members just as well because all of you have busy lives, you have many other
    things that you do and this time that you take from those very busy lives is very much
    appreciated and I know how much time and effort can be consumed by your role here.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Colleges have a very, very unique role and it&#146;s a very,
    I think, difficult role for many people to appreciate and to fully understand &#150;
    it&#146;s also a very important role I have always believed very strongly. And because
    you&#146;re not for the professional members if you will &#150;you&#146;re not necessarily
    speaking for teachers, you&#146;re speaking on behalf of teachers in the public interest.
    And as public members, you&#146;re not here to represent any particular special group or
    organization, you&#146;re here to speak in the public interest. And it&#146;s a very, very
    unique role and many organizations do not have the challenges that you have to walk that
    very, very delicate, but very, very important line, as you do the work that you do here
    and will continue to do in the future.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">I have spent the last couple of months meeting with many of
    the groups and the organizations in the education sector. In a fit of new Minister
    optimism I said that my door was open, that I would meet with all the interested groups
    from the education sector &#150; no one had told me how many there are. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">So it has been time-consuming but it also has been, for me, a
    very useful exercise, a very useful opportunity to hear where all of the different groups
    are coming from, to get a clear understanding of the various issues and the points of
    view, but also to open up what I hope will be good communications links between the
    different sectors and also use that as a building block for good effective working
    relationships, which I think again will be very important as we move forward in the
    education sector. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">And it&#146;s certainly one of the reasons I am here today
    because the Ontario College of Teachers is a key partner in a collaborative effort to
    provide the best quality education system we can for our children. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">I need your advice, I need your support, I need your skills,
    I need your expertise. If we are going to jointly equip Ontario&#146;s youth with the
    learning tools and the knowledge that they&#146;re going to need to succeed in a very very
    rapidly changing world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Here&#146;s the body regulating the teaching profession. You
    bring together teachers, parents and all of the other education partners with a common
    purpose and that is of strengthening the quality of the teaching profession, which in turn
    improves the quality of the classroom learning. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">For example, I am aware of the work you have been doing on
    standards of practice and professional learning and I believe it&#146;s very important
    work that&#146;s going to contribute to quality education. I also know that our
    perspectives are going to differ. We are going to have different views on some issues
    &#150; I can&#146;t imagine which ones they might be but I am sure there might be some.
    And that&#146;s okay because all of the different groups in education, we all wear
    different hats and that&#146;s okay too. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">But the choice we can make is that we can have those
    differences around tables such as this and work them out for the benefit of what I
    believe, based on the discussions I have had with everybody, the common ground we all
    share. We have very similar goals and that&#146;s to give Ontario&#146;s kids the best
    quality education that we can and to ensure that Ontario&#146;s teachers are the best that
    they can be as well. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">The future that our kids face &#150; our children face &#150;
    and I probably don&#146;t need to tell any of you here, especially the parents in the
    room, but you know people call it the wired world, wired world of tomorrow, world of
    technology, knowledge-based skills, all of those buzz words that we&#146;ve heard from all
    of those folks out there in the economy and management consultants who like to speak about
    these things but it&#146;s important that we recognize that&#146;s the world our children
    are going into and if the past is any guide, the structure of work, the employment
    patterns that our children are going to face are going to be very, very different from
    what we are experiencing today. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">And it&#146;s also been said too that many of the children
    who graduate several years from now are going to be working at jobs that you and I have
    never even heard of. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">So the change to the education system that we have been
    implementing since 1995 have been initiated to meet those challenges, to respond to those
    challenges that children are facing. Because we want to ensure that our children have the
    skills and the motivation to think, to learn, to adapt, to grow and to win out there in a
    very, very tough global marketplace. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">An education system that strives for excellence is one of the
    most important investments we can make &#150; and not only strives for excellence but can
    produce excellence. And we all know there are many excellent things that we can point to
    out there that are happening today as we speak. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">But we also know that we have to do an even better job if we
    want to meet that challenge for our children. So funding, curriculum, standards, overall
    performance, accountability, all of the past education approaches have cried out for fresh
    ideas and new directions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">It was considerable agreement that change was needed and many
    of you may know that back in 1994-1995, we put out several discussions papers based on the
    consultation that the Premier &#150; party leader at the time-- Mike Harris had done with
    many, many groups across the province and there was considerable agreement around many of
    those changes. There was too much school board bureaucracy, property taxpayers were
    complaining that property taxes for education were going through the roof and teachers in
    the classroom were sure telling you that they didn&#146;t see those increases in the
    support that they needed. It was too much spending outside the classroom, there was
    performance that parents and employers said that was seriously lacking. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Parents wanted more information about their children&#146;s
    performance and what they were learning and how they could keep and be involved. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">We didn&#146;t invent these problems or these challenges but
    we did accept the responsibility for dealing with them based on what teachers, students,
    parents, taxpayers told us needed to be done. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">And we&#146;ve made some very clear commitments which we take
    very seriously &#150; the higher standards, more challenging curriculum, more
    accountability, safer schools, more money in the classroom in a way that is fair and
    equitable. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">And we take those commitments seriously and that&#146;s what
    guides us, not speculative articles in papers like the Toronto Star &#150; I don&#146;t
    know if they&#146;re here or not, but anyway. I digress a minute but one thing I would
    like to mention, since it has dominated a fair bit of attention, is that every year the
    ministries go through program review. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">It&#146;s not a secret, we announce it, we talk about it, and
    I want to be clear that we intend to respect our promises with respect to education
    funding as we laid out in the election. Our government is committed, our classroom funding
    will not only be protected, but enhanced, we are, and we will keep that promise. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">We will also keep our promise that we continue to look at
    ways that we can find spending savings in bureaucracy and waste and duplication and how do
    we put those savings back into classroom education. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Now, I know our critics like to say that we&#146;ve given up
    on public education, but that is not the case. Nothing could be further from the truth
    because education is the building block not only for our economic prosperity in terms of
    our young people to able to go out there and succeed in whatever profession or work or
    trade or jobs that they might choose. It&#146;s not only economic prosperity but it&#146;s
    also quality of life so that those young people can succeed not only in the workplace but
    also as individuals in the community. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">And that is a building block of Ontario. So we take it very
    seriously and in reforming our education system, we have consulted widely and we have
    continued and I will continue to seek the advice of all of our education partners.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Now just to touch on a couple of specific issues that I know
    you are interested in. I am asking you to provide advice on how to implement a teacher
    testing program that is cost-effective and that addresses the following parameters:</font><ul>
      <li><font face="Book Antiqua">The regular assessment of the teacher&#146;s knowledge and
        skills </font></li>
      <li><font face="Book Antiqua">Written and other assessment techniques with a link to
        re-certification </font></li>
      <li><font face="Book Antiqua">Remediation for those who fail assessments, and </font></li>
      <li><font face="Book Antiqua">De-certification as a consequence of failed remediation.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">I am aware that the idea of putting teachers to the test has
    its worries as recent headlines describe this initiative. I am aware that it may sound
    threatening to some teachers and I know that for some, they consider it demeaning, but
    it&#146;s not. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">And it&#146;s not meant to be. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Because I know we have excellent teachers in this province. I
    know because I&#146;ve had some &#150; I&#146;ve had many actually -- who had a real
    influence in my life and I made the mistake in one of my speeches of actually naming them.
    I didn&#146;t realize at the time how much effort and energy the media present would put
    in to tracking them down and finding out who they were and asking them all what they
    thought of the new Education Minister an d how well she had done in school. I am pleased
    to report that they&#146;ve all been very, very discreet but also they then to fall into
    two categories &#150; those who are quite happy to claim responsibility for producing a
    Mike Harris Cabinet Minister from their classroom and those who don&#146;t. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">So it has been interesting. So you&#146;ll forgive me if I
    don&#146;t name the many teachers who I&#146;ve had but who I remember and who have indeed
    had an impact on me. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">So I understand how important that is for all of our children
    and I think any parent here and any parent that you ask can tell you how important a
    teacher is to that child&#146;s education year &#150; extremely important. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Now I also want to be clear that I recognize that many, many
    teachers participate in various professional learning programs and activities on an
    on-going basis. Staying up-to-date, though, is not a challenge that is unique to the
    teaching profession. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">All professions, from teachers to lawyers to accountants, to
    child and health care workers are facing this challenge and they, too, are addressing the
    need for constant upgrade and while the mechanisms may vary from profession to profession
    or from regulatory college to regulatory college, the goal of helping the profession both
    individually and as a group to constantly get better and the challenges to do that are
    very, very similar because I also recognize that simply testing knowledge does not mean
    that someone can teach or someone can teach that knowledge. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">So we quite recognize that if we&#146;re going to have an
    effective and appropriate program, we have to make sure that knowledge, skills, abilities
    are all properly and appropriately assessed so we can ensure that we have the best
    teachers in our classroom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">The other thing I should mention about it as well is that
    training, on-going professional development are essential and teacher testing is meant to
    be a form of quality assurance if you will and a guarantee for all of our students and our
    parents that all of our teachers are as good as they can be. It&#146;s meant to
    complement, not replace, current teacher assessments by school boards and principals. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">I look forward to receiving the College&#146;s advice by year
    end and I know that&#146;s a tight deadline and I also understand that several groups,
    however, including faculties and teacher federations, have already started some very
    important work on teacher testing and as you formulate your advice to me I encourage you
    to consult these organizations and other education partners. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">In moving forward with this program, we are also seeking the
    advice of parents, principals, board officials and other education partners. And in
    addition, ministry staff are continuing their research and work to identify best practices
    in other professions, other jurisdictions, as part of our on-going policy development in
    this very important area for a made-in-Ontario solution. And I know that by working
    together, we are going to ensure that we have a good program that meets the goals that we
    have set. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">I&#146;d like to just touch on a couple of other matters
    because I want to thank the members, staff of the College, the members of the Council for
    some very remarkable accomplishments over the past two years because I have been pleased
    to see you moving forward as a regulatory body with the development of the <strong><em>Standards
    of Practice for the Teaching Profession</em></strong> &#150; I haven&#146;t had an
    opportunity yet to review this document but I certainly expect and hope I am able to do so
    soon &#150; and it is my hope that it will prove to be timely and we may wish to consider
    how we apply these standards to all teachers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Your members have also responded well to the College&#146;s
    first accreditation reviews of teacher training programs offered by education faculties in
    Ontario universities. This is the final year for the pilot phase of the accreditation
    program and I look forward to receiving an update and further information from the College
    about a proposed accreditation regulation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">I also look forward to receiving a draft of the ethical
    standards for teachers, which I understand, is currently being developed by the College. A
    quality education, as I mentioned, depends very much on quality teaching and I think that
    this framework is another step to help ensure that. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">With the anticipated high rate of retirement by Ontario
    teachers in the next few years, there is going to be a massive wave of new hires over the
    next decade and the College&#146;s registry, along with the data from the data from the
    Ontario Teacher Pension Board and the ministry will be very valuable in predicting and
    helping us meet shortages of qualified teachers that may occur. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Your study on teacher supply and demand drew public attention
    to the teacher shortage and I am pleased with the increased number of applicants to
    faculties of education as more teachers retire, but also as more and more young people
    understand and recognize the importance, the enjoyment that might come as they stand in
    front of a classroom and help young people to learn. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Finally, I applaud the College&#146;s new criminal record
    screening policy, which came into effect last January, because I think that making a
    criminal reference check a condition of certification for new teachers will ensure that
    they are worthy of the trust placed into them by their students, their parents and their
    professional colleagues. And our government supports the notion of requiring all staff
    that come into contact with children in schools to be screened and we will certainly be
    keeping you informed of our progress on this initiative. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Before I close, I want to take a few minutes to address some
    other current issues of concern to you and I know that one of the outstanding items is the
    College&#146;s six-month extension of the term of the current governing Council to October
    31 of next year. I am very pleased to tell you today that the government has approved the
    College&#146;s request for this extension and I appreciate your patience. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Another is the status of the College&#146;s proposed election
    regulation, which seeks a number of changes to your first election regulation and this is
    currently under review by the ministry staff and I hope to give you more information on
    this matter very shortly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">I know that one of the things that Donna Marie raised with me
    &#150; we had an opportunity for a telephone call recently and she asked me what I could
    do about the 18 issues that you had referred to the ministry which had not yet been dealt
    with. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">When I asked staff to answer this question for me, I was
    answered that we had 21 issues that had not yet been dealt with so I have asked for them
    to develop a work plan that will enable us to bring closure on other outstanding requests
    from your organization as soon as possible and again I appreciate your patience for this.
    I understand one of the reasons for this is when the College was set up, you promptly
    stole the best and the brightest of staff from the ministry so I used that as my excuse
    but it is now worn out and we need to move forward with these issues so you can move
    forward with your job.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">In the weeks and months ahead, I look forward to working very
    closely with the College on these and other very important matters that focus on
    excellence in teaching and in learning because protecting and enhancing resources
    committed to classroom education is one of the cornerstones of provincial responsibility
    and we do indeed take that seriously. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">And just again because that&#146;s an issue that&#146;s been
    talked about publicly in the last couple of days, school boards are projected to receive a
    total of 13.25 billion dollars in funding for 1999-2000 and funding for classroom
    education will increase to match rising enrolment. The level of classroom funding in the
    coming year will be 575 million dollars higher than in 1997 and we will continue to keep
    up the pressure in eliminating waste and duplication in areas outside the classroom such
    as admin. cost or any other unnecessary bureaucracy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">We will launch initiatives that will ensure safe and
    productive school environments &#150; you may have heard us talk about some of those under
    our code of conduct &#150; we also want to continue to support school councils and direct
    parental involvement in the school system. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">The government has a new mandate and a very, very ambitious
    agenda and I tried to be very clear about the directions of that agenda and what we want
    to achieve in this particular mandate and I&#146;ve also been very clear about the need
    for your advice, your assistance, as well as that of the other education partners if we
    are to meet the challenges that lay ahead for all of us. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">The education sector is made up with many different groups,
    teachers, students, parents, school boards, faculties, educators, trustees, taxpayers and
    the education system belongs to none of us. It belongs to the children who are going to
    get their future through it and it belongs to the communities who support our schools. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Your members here, all of you who have dedicated your
    careers, in some cases, indeed a great part of your lives to education and there is
    perhaps no greater reward than seeing a student flourish in a positive learning
    environment that we&#146;ve worked hard to shape and develop. And there&#146;s perhaps no
    greater privilege than helping our young people with the knowledge and the skills that
    they need to succeed in their individual lives. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">So I look forward very much to our continued working
    relationship &#150; or I guess the beginning &#150; of hopefully a good relationship and I
    wish you all the best in your future deliberations. I know if you&#146;re anything like
    our caucus and our Cabinet, you have people around this table who get along all the time
    and there is great consensus on all of the issues and I wish you the best in your
    deliberations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Book Antiqua">Thank you very much.</p>
