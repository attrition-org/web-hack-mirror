    Standards of Practice for the Teaching Profession </b><p><big>T</big></font>he standards
    of practice for the teaching profession were developed using a variety of sources and
    resources. Existing statements from other educational jurisdictions were reviewed. This
    review included both national and international examples. Standards of practice statements
    from other self-regulatory bodies in Ontario were also examined.</p>
    <p>Hundreds of members of the College and the public contributed through structured
    research activities to the development of the standards of practice. The structured
    research activities included interviews, focus groups, and written responses to questions
    posed on the College web site and in College publications. In addition, many participants
    offered feedback through e-mail, discussion groups, writing teams and written
    correspondence.</p>
    <p>A preliminary draft was reviewed by more than 500 members of the College and the public
    who engaged in developmental feedback sessions. Many groups and individuals also prepared
    written responses to this early draft. Data from the developmental feedback sessions and
    the issues brought forward in these responses provided the basis for the revision of the
    preliminary draft.</p>
    <p>The standards of practice have been developed to answer the question &quot;What does it
    mean to be a teacher?&quot; The responses contributed by participants in the development
    and revision processes were highly personalized, deeply reflective and complex.
    Participants spoke passionately about the importance of teaching &#150; for now and for a
    future we can not yet envision.</p>
    <p>The standards of practice are descriptors for the teaching profession. They will also
    serve as a catalyst for discussion, debate and movement toward a consensus about what it
    means to be a teacher. </p>
    <p>The document, <i>Standards of Practice for the Teaching Profession</i>, was approved by
    the Council of the Ontario College of Teachers on November 19, 1999.</p>
    <p>Ce document est disponible en fran<font face="Arial" size="2">ç</font>ais sous le

    <strong><font COLOR="#800080"><p>Introduction</font></strong><b></p>
    <p>Self-Regulation and Standards of Practice</b></p>
    <p>The Ontario College of Teachers is the self-regulatory body for the teaching profession
    in Ontario.</p>
    <p>A self-regulatory body must be able to articulate what it is that makes that
    professional body unique. In the case of the Ontario College of Teachers, it means
    answering the question &quot;What does it mean to be a teacher?&quot; Professional
    self-regulatory bodies use the term &quot;standards of practice&quot; to refer to the
    descriptors that answer this question. For the teaching profession, this description
    includes statements about students and student learning, professional knowledge, teaching
    practice, leadership and community, and ongoing professional learning.</p>
    <p>The standards of practice for the teaching profession provide the foundation for
    pre-service and in-service programs accredited by the Ontario College of Teachers. </p>
    <p>This means that the Ontario College of Teachers has now assumed, through legislation,
    the responsibility for the accreditation of pre-service education programs at the
    faculties of education in Ontario universities. It also means that the College will
    accredit forms of in-service professional learning. In-service professional learning
    currently accredited by the College through Regulation 184/97 under the <i>Ontario College
    of Teachers Act</i> includes programs such as the Additional Qualification Courses, the
    Principal's Qualification Program, and the Supervisory Officer's Qualifications Program.
    Another challenge will involve identifying ways to accredit other programs and the ongoing
    professional learning that takes place in practice.</p>
    <p>Professional growth is at the core of teacher professionalism. The Ontario College of
    Teachers through the accreditation of pre-service and in-service programs based on the
    standards of practice provides members of the College with opportunities for this ongoing
    professional growth.</p>
    <p>The professional learning programs accredited by the Ontario College of Teachers must
    address the professional growth needs of members from the time they prepare to enter the
    teaching profession to the time they retire. In this document the term professional
    learning refers to those programs accredited by the Ontario College of Teachers.
    Professional growth is a more inclusive term recognizing the many ways teachers acquire
    professional knowledge. </p>
    <p>In the <i>College of Teachers Act</i>, Regulations under the Act, and in this statement
    of standards of practice &quot;teacher&quot; means a member of the Ontario College of
    Teachers. This definition requires that the College accredit professional learning
    programs for not only classroom teachers but also for members in a broad range of roles
    such as principals, occasional teachers, superintendents, and directors of education.</p>
    <b><p><big><font COLOR="#800080">Principles</font></big></b></p>
    <p>The standards of practice for the teaching profession were developed to support these
    principles.</p>
    <b><p>The standards of practice describe what it means to be a member of the teaching
    profession in Ontario.</b></p>
    <p>This description highlights, in a general way, the knowledge, skills, and values that
    are inherent to the teaching profession. They articulate the goals and aspirations of a
    profession with a mandate to foster student learning. Members of the College, as members
    of the teaching profession, foster student learning through a variety of roles in
    education.</p>
    <b><p>The standards of practice are reflective of the beliefs and values expressed by the
    participants in the development process.</b></p>
    <p>The standards of practice were developed with input from members of the College and the
    public. The participants in the development process recognized the contribution the
    teaching profession makes to Ontario society. These participants highlighted the need to
    ensure that professional learning programs accredited by the College are based on the
    standards of practice and that these programs prepare members of the profession to meet
    the challenge of preparing students to be contributing members of Ontario society.</p>
    <b><p>The standards of practice recognize and value diversity in teaching.</b></p>
    <p>The description of what it means to be a member of the teaching profession recognizes
    that effective teaching requires the use of a range of teaching styles and techniques.
    These variations afford teachers the opportunity to make choices, accommodate change, and
    meet student needs.</p>
    <b><p>The standards of practice are based on the premises that personal and professional
    growth is a developmental process and that teachers move through a variety of career and
    life stages.</b></p>
    <p>Standards of practice provide the foundation for ongoing professional growth through
    the professional learning programs accredited by the Ontario College of Teachers. </p>
    <p>Teacher candidates in a pre-service program are involved in professional learning based
    on the standards of practice at a level appropriate for beginning teachers. Candidates in
    the Principal's Qualification Program engage in professional learning based on the
    standards of practice as well &#150; but from a school administration perspective.
    Participants in the Supervisory Officer's Qualifications Program will see the standards of
    practice from a system perspective. Participants in the Additional Qualification Course
    for Special Education experience professional learning based on the standards of practice
    and highlighting the needs of exceptional students.</p>
    <p>Teachers, as they move through different career and life stages, will engage in a
    variety of professional learning activities. The basis for this professional learning will
    be the standards of practice for the teaching profession.</p>
    <b><p>The standards of practice for the teaching profession are interdependent.</b></p>
    <p>The question &quot;What does it mean to be a teacher?&quot; generates multiple
    responses. Focusing on a single area of the standards of practice does not address the
    complexity of the teaching profession. </p>

        the College also recognize that the teaching profession can not carry this responsibility
        alone. In order to ensure that Ontario students are well prepared to meet the challenges
        of the future, the teaching profession needs the support of government, employers,
        parents, students and the Ontario public-at-large. As individuals, and through our
        respective organizations, all must work together to create classrooms, schools and
        education systems where the teaching profession is able to work toward the goals and
