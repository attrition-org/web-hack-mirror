    </b>August 1999<br>

    </font><font FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold" SIZE="4"><p></font><font size="4" color="#800080">DESIGNING THE SURVEY</font><font SIZE="3"></p>
    <p>The Standards of Practice and Education Committee approved a written questionnaire. Two
    outside consultants from OISE/UT were contracted to create the pre-test questionnaire.
    Several consultation sessions were held between the consultants and staff of the Standards
    of Practice and Education Unit. In April 1998, the Committee agreed to pre-test the
    questionnaire.</p>
    <b><p><font color="#800080">Pre-test</font></b></p>
    <p>Using a representative sample of the College membership, 69 questionnaires were mailed
    directly to College member's homes in June 1998. The Institute for Social Research at York
    University provided the mail-out and statistical data information on returns.</p>
    <p>The pre-test return rate was 42 per cent. The survey returns were very slow. However,
    excellent feedback was provided on question sequencing and clarity. These results were
    used to create a revised questionnaire in the fall of 1998.</p>
    <b><p><font color="#800080">Larger Survey</font></b></p>
    <p>The Standards of Practice and Education Committee decided that the questionnaire would
    be distributed to a larger group of classroom teachers. Using the College's registry
    system, a random sample group of 1,200 members was created. This sample group was then
    used as the foundation for the larger survey sample. A random sample of 870 classroom
    teachers was selected from the pool of 1,200 (800 English and 70 French).</p>
    <p></font><font SIZE="4"><font color="#800080">CONDUCTING THE SURVEY</font></p>
    </font><font SIZE="3"><p>The College contracted the Institute for Social Research at York
    University to distribute the survey to the larger group of members. The implementation
    strategy included four mailings if needed. In March 1999, the first coded mailing was
    made, followed by a postcard reminder after three weeks if the questionnaire had not been
    returned. In late April 1999, a second mailing was made to all non-respondents of the
    first mailing. Three weeks later a final postcard reminder was mailed to all
    non-respondents.</p>
    <p>The Institute for Social Research compiled the survey results with data sets and
    frequencies and made this information available to the College in June 1999.</p>

    <p><font color="#800080">Formal Learning Programs</font></p>
    </b><p>Professional learning is defined as any learning activity participants undertake
    with deliberate intention of gaining additional skills, knowledge and understandings
    related to teaching. In this first part of the questionnaire, we asked participants to
    think about their professional learning activities in the last two years. This included
    the 1996-97 and 1997-98 school years and the preceding summers.</p>
    <p>Listed below are activities typically associated with professional learning. Ninety-two
    per cent of the respondents indicated they had participated in formal learning activities
    in the last two years. The formal learning activities are indicated below.<ul>
      <li>77 per cent had attended a one-day or half-day program</li>
      <li>65 per cent had attended a conference related to their work</li>
      <li>35 per cent participated in two-day conferences with and without a scheduled follow-up </li>
      <li>25 per cent attended Additional Qualification and university courses </li>
      <li>23 per cent participated in a train-the-trainer program </li>
      <li>3 per cent indicated that they had attended Principal's Qualifications Program and
        Supervisory Officer's Qualifications programs<br>

    <font SIZE="3"><p>In general, College members who responded to this survey are very active
    in a variety of formal learning programs. Ninety-two per cent (92 per cent) confirmed
    their participation in at least one formal program during the last two years.</p>
    <p>Another major finding of the professional learning survey is that College members who
    completed the questionnaire have been heavily involved in various informal learning
    activities during the last two years.</p>
    <p>The majority of the respondents to the questionnaire (over 75 per cent) agreed that as
    they became more experienced, their interests in professional learning became much more
    focussed. As well, they said that their school culture encouraged professional learning
    and that most of the time they could find the professional learning programs and resources
    they needed. Most of the respondents (70 per cent) said they felt very much in control of
    their professional learning. Very few respondents (15 per cent) agreed that professional
    development (PD) days provided most of the professional learning needed in a typical year.

    <p>This questionnaire survey was the first quantitative research project for the Standards
    of Practice and Education Committee. The results will be helpful in the decision-making
    process related to the development of a professional learning framework for the teaching
    profession in Ontario. The Standards of Practice and Education Committee will consider
    expanding the research database with a second survey on professional learning for the
    members of the College who are in leadership roles.</p>
    <p>The Network for New Approaches to Lifelong Learning (NALL), in conjunction with the
    Canadian Teachers' Federation (CTF) conducted a survey in the spring of 1999. Many of the
    questions on this survey are comparable to the College's survey on professional learning.
    The response data will also be studied to see if there are implications for the
    professional learning framework.</font></p>
