Algorithm Cracker hacked this server. I did no damage so
don't worry just delete this index.html and rename index.2.html
to index.html

Just to let everyone know, Y2K bug is not gone, it's still
alive waiting to strike. So prepare your systems. The Y2K 
bug is partly COBOL's fault.

Anyway, read my article <a href="./savior.html">here</a> I really
want people to read this, it took me a lot of time and effort 
to write the "essay".

Greetings to Kristen of course i'm in love with her.
