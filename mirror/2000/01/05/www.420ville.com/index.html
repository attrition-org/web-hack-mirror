<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">We defaced this website because these people
are using this domain for some gaming shit when they could be enlightening the
less-intelligent about that wonderful plant that's known and loved by many.</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">I'm talkin' about da chronic, of course! The
bud, weed, green, mary jane, buddah, ganja, reefer, dope, doja, dank.. whatever
you call it, it's all the same - a great plant that not only stimulates the mind
but could also drastically change the way we live (were it not for the fucked up
government) for the better. Hemp can produce 4 times as much paper as trees. Just think about
that. It is also unknown by most that our founding forefathers were hemp farmers
(George Washington toked it up). The Declaration of Independence was even
written on hemp paper. There are so many uses for hemp it's crazy. It could
really help farmers during droughts when regular crops cannot grow, but thanks
to our fucked up government and unaware citizens, legalization may or may not be
near. That's why everyone should visit <a href="http://www.norml.org">www.norml.org</a>
and spread the word about our friend, herb, and let the truth be known!!!</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">This site was defaced for a reason, and that's
how it will be from now on. No more senseless bullshit defacements. We encourage
all the other little script kiddie defacers to do the same.</font></b></p>
