        <p><small><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Here are some general tips which we hope may help
        you if you're computer system has trouble digesting sites on the internet or if you're
        having trouble at salmankhan.com especially. Check it out and see if something here won't
        help you over any hurdles you've found that are preventing your participation. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Windows Optimization Tips </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Arial, Helvetica">1. Try to run Scandisk and re-boot (without
        network connections if your PC is connected to one). Also, remove any non-essential
        applications, system monitors and virus checkers which are hogs on memory. If you think
        you might want to surf to an area that is unsafe, you can always restore the Virus
        software for that specific purpose. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Arial, Helvetica">2. Lock-ups and GPF's (more common with Win3.xx)
        tell us that something in Windows is conflicting in memory. One likely culprit is network
        drivers (which often reside in lower memory eating up the available conventional memory
        for other applications). In addition, an otherwise unaffected graphics driver may fail
        during browsing on the internet where memory is heavily taxed and which may occur when
        you're trying to launch Netscape 3.xx and MS Internet Explorer 3.xx on a 486 system with
        8MB of RAM or less. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Arial, Helvetica">3. Make sure Win95/98 is properly tuned before
        heading out on the net. Be sure to check your Win95/98 System Icon in Control Panel. Next,
        select the Device Manager Tab to see if any hardware is incorrectly configured. You should
        see a small yellow exclamation point next to any device causing problems due to improper
        configuration. Also check the Performance Tab using the System Dialog Box to make sure
        performance is indicated as Optimum. Let Windows manage memory where it indicates a
        choice. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Arial, Helvetica">4. Be sure to have at least IE3.xx or Netscape
        3.xx or higher on your system. You can easily find both Netscape and Microsoft on the web
        to check for updates and bug reports on your particular browser and version. On Compuserve
        or AOL, search using the FIND feature to locate Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape
        Navigator. You can find either browser's download area by using &quot;IEXPLORER&quot; or
        &quot;NETSCAPE&quot; as the keywords. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Arial, Helvetica">5. In Win95/98, use SAFE MODE during reboot to
        isolate problems with drivers (press F8 during the reboot sequence when you see
        &quot;Starting Win 95.... &quot; on the screen). See if you still get the lock up after
        re-booting in SAFE MODE. If the system won't boot in SAFE MODE, then use the
        &quot;step-by-step&quot; confirmation method to reboot so you can eliminate anything in
        Config.sys, or Autoexec.bat that may be causing the problem. &quot;Step-by-Step&quot;
        boots are available from the Menu that will appear after clicking the F8 key while
        &quot;Starting Win95...&quot; is on the screen. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Arial, Helvetica">6. Video drivers are very important
        troubleshooting areas with any Win3.xx system or Win95/98 system, especially when you're
        noticing screen freezes or lockups. Again, trying a reboot with a minimal Config.sys and
        Autoexec.bat should isolate any problems. Furthermore, you should check Control Panel for
        the &quot;386 Enhanced&quot; icon in Win3.xx to make sure you're using a &quot;Permanent
        Swap File&quot;. This isn't necessary in Win95/98 as memory is swapped dynamically without
        user intervention. Finally, again I'd recommend upgrading Netscape Navigator or Internet
        Explorer to at least version 3.xx. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Arial, Helvetica">7. Possible Configuration. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Arial, Helvetica">386 System - Nothing but problems here. This
        system is going to cause trouble and you may not get optimum performance browsing,
        especially to a highly graphic web site on the internet. If you're serious though, you
        might try disabling your browser's graphics downloading in PREFERENCES and seeing if that
        will allow access. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Arial, Helvetica">486 System - The trick here is to be sure you have
        a lot of RAM. 16MB minimum and then you'll have a slow response. Disabling graphics here
        too can help improve performance. Disabling other applications and non-essential system
        monitors, shells, TSR's in DOS, and anything else that is a hog on memory is sure to
        improve your experience. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Pentium System - This is the preferred CPU for
        browsing on the Internet. If you have MMX Technology, so much the better. If you're
        surfing with a Pentium II, then you should be flying through sites. Again, the more RAM
        the better, and at least 32MB of RAM should give the best performance on the web. Make
        sure you've loaded either MS Internet Explorer 3 or 4 or Netscape Navigator 3 or 4. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Modems: You really must have at least a 28.8K BPS
        modem to get any kind of enjoyment from internet browsing. A 14.4K BPS internet experience
        is livable, but it will increase the wait time while graphics are loading. You might see
        improvement by disabling graphics in your browser's PREFERENCES or OPTIONS settings. Its
        also important to be sure that your modem is configured properly. Most manufacturers
        provide installation disks with modems, but even then you might have an out-dated
        configuration file that may have been revised since you purchased the modem or computer.
        If the modem came installed with your system, check at the manufacturers web site for
        recommendations for upgrading modem initialization strings. Many modem and PC
        manufacturers are available on Compuserve in the MODEM VENDOR A &amp; B Forums or in the
        PC Manufacturer's Forum (i.e., the Packard Bell Forum). On AOL you should be able to find
        support for Modem Manufacturer's as well by using the FIND tool and typing KEYWORD
        &quot;Modem.&quot; </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Arial, Helvetica">8. Miscellaneous Surfing Tips. Okay, let's say
        you've configured the system correctly and everything was working fine for a while but
        then suddenly you find new errors and problems pop up and you're suddenly surfing too
        slow. If SCANDISK and a reboot doesn't clear up your problem, then you should try clearing
        out the browser's cache and temporary files. Often, a hard disk will fill up with all the
        stuff you've been surfing through on the internet and then your machine will start choking
        as the browser's cache grows to unmanageable sizes and available disk space begins
        shrinking. Besides the cache, it is also a good idea to clean out your &quot;HISTORY&quot;
        and &quot;TEMP&quot; folders as well. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Arial, Helvetica">9. Next, the way your browser uses its cache is an
        important consideration. Highly dynamic sites (like Salman Khan's Web Site which
        constantly changes) will often fail if your browser is set to use its hard disk cache
        first when looking for files. Caches were designed to speed up performance on the net. The
        idea that its quicker for your browser to retrieve data from the hard drive is a good one,
        as long as the web page isn't constantly changing. Check the OPTIONS or PREFERENCES area
        of your browser to make sure that its checking the site first (and not the cache) on every
        request your browser makes seeking data. Sometimes, the option might be set to only check
        the web site once each session (or even once each day.) </font></small></p>
