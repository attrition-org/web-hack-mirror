          <u><b>A Growing&nbsp;Company.</b></u> RSL is a small, 
        woman-owned business based in SE Michigan with an office specializing in 
        the provision of highly qualified&nbsp; consultant programmers 
          located&nbsp;in Austin, Texas.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have programmers located in Maryland, Ohio and Kansas who 
          work through telecommuting on projects for customers located throughout the 
          Eastern and Central states. This environment requires a disciplined, 
          responsible and mature work force. <font color="green" face="">Clear project management and task definition is crucial to being able 
          to manage these scattered resources. RSL has been making this work for over 
          3 years. </font>The cost savings for this environment allow us to keep 
          overhead costs to a minimum, which are reflected in our charges. RSL can 
          provide experienced personnel at exceedingly competitive rates.
