<p><font size="-1"><b>A day after Apple customers were warned of a security flaw in the
Macintosh operating system, users are saying the fix issued by the company causes as many
problems as it cures. </b></p>

<p>Apple sought to reassure customers today that the fix--created for a security flaw that
would allow a third party to corral some Apple computers in a &quot;denial of
service&quot; attack--indeed works properly, and that at least some of the reported
problems could be a case of simple misunderstanding. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yesterday, customers learned of the potential flaw in Apple networking software that
could potentially allow a malicious programmer to use Macs to attack other computers under
a limited set of circumstances. </p>

<p>Users posting comments to various Web sites such as Apple's own online support site
noted a variety of maladies after installing the software, including network connections
that were unstable or impossible to maintain and problems running other software such as
Internet browsers. </p>

<p>In some instances, the problems can be cured by not using the software. The patch is
only needed by Mac users if their computer is hooked up to the Net via &quot;always
on&quot; digital subscriber line (DSL) or cable modem connections, said Phil Schiller,
vice president of worldwide marketing for Apple. Users with dial-up modems don't need the
software, he said. </p>

<p>Barring that exception, some other problems might be cured by a push of a button. </p>

<p>Network settings often change after each time a computer initiates a connection to the
Net, because many service providers assign a computer a new IP (Internet protocol) address
each time--a practice analagous to giving out a new phone number or home address to
uniquely identify a user every time someone makes a call. </p>

<p>Normally, if a user's network settings are changed, they take effect immediately,
Schiller explained. He said that the software patch works correctly, but in this instance
the computer needs to be restarted if settings are changed. Future versions of the fix
will rectify that issue, he said. </p>

<p>However, if a user's settings are always changing--in other words, the IP address is
different every time the computer is turned on--the patch isn't needed, he said, because
an attacker has to know the computer's address in order to exploit the vulnerability. </p>

<p>The fix was issued because Mac computers could be used to aid in what's known as a
denial-of-service attack. According to the Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Emergency
Response Team, in such a circumstance: &quot;Intruders can flood networks with
overwhelming amounts of traffic or cause machines to crash or otherwise become
unstable.&quot; </p>

<p>Dr. John Copeland, who chairs the Georgia Institute of Technology's School of
Electrical and Computer Engineering, recommended that the correction for the flaw be
applied before New Year's Eve in order to prevent the Macs from being used to attack other
computers. Copeland was first to uncover the issue. </p>

<p>As previously reported by CNET News.com, security experts have warned of a possible
concerted effort to attack computers on New Year's Eve although no direct evidence of any
plots has been gathered. </p>

<p>There is no evidence yet that Macs have been used to perpetrate an attack.</font></p>

there security holes.&nbsp; All you do is cover them up and try to keep them from the
public.&nbsp; And even thou Apple's patch went astray and didnt work they made a new one
that worked.&nbsp; So please take this down and try to follow there direction.</strong></font></small></p>
