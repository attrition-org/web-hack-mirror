    href="http://www.themastersschool.com">www.vea.org</a> - I came across this article while
    surfing the net. YTcracker said it all. Active web page defacer YTCracker has written an
    article in response to Brian Martin's article Is It Worth IT, published by HNN last week.
    Mr Martin asked if the recent spate of web page defacements was worth the trouble it
    causes the perpetrators. YTCracker has recently defaced such high profile pages as Bureau
    of Land Management National Training Center and the Defense Contracts Audit Agency.
    YTCracker now explains the motivation and says that, Yes, it is worth it. </small></font><p><font

    <p><small><font face="Verdana">This article was written in response to an article written
    by Brian Martin concerning web page defacement, its risks, and its consequences. He asks
    the eternal question &quot;Is it worth it?&quot; to those who participate in these kinds
    of activities. Many of the individuals I have talked to have mixed thoughts about the
    article. Some individuals say it really taught them something valuable. Some said it
    scared them into considering quitting. Others, including myself, carry a somewhat
    apathetic attitude toward the whole thing in general. Allow me to explain. A few things
    need to be established about this defacement culture. One, I believe that this in no way
    constitutes as hacking. On any level, no matter how you look at it, web page defacement is
    destructive. In some cases, it can ruin the credibility of a company or a government
    agency. Two, I believe that web page defacement should carry a &quot;message&quot;. When I
    spoke with Brian earlier, I tried to make it clear that we [as third person onlookers to a
    defacement] cannot determine this message in some cases. To us, &quot;hack0r x 0ens u in
    9d9&quot; probably means nothing at all. To hack0r x, it may have. However, I personally
    believe that if hack0r x is going to break into this page and disrupt their message, his
    better be worthwhile. Thirdly, I believe that there is a &quot;whiter&quot; side to
    defacement. This side operates within definitive ethical boundaries and attempts to make
    web page cracking as non-malicious as possible. I do my best to have the ability to define
    myself under this ethical side. I back everything up. I leave the administrator
    information on how to fix the security hole. I don't disrupt the flow of information - I
    leave a link to the original page in plain sight. While these factors don't guarantee my
    immunity, they surely aren't raising any eyebrows and leading people to contemplate my
    threat to national security. I am not concerned with leaving messages like &quot;fuq da
    fedz in 9d9 suk0r my nutsaq.&quot; That, frankly, is asking for trouble. It also serves no
    purpose. Why do I do it? There are a few key reasons. I am sure that everyone out there
    that contributes to this scene has their own. First off, I am seventeen [before I go any
    further, I am referring to seventeen as &quot;kid&quot;, not &quot;a minor and therefore
    will receive lesser penalty&quot;]. As a young member of society oftentimes I find that my
    voice goes unheard. In a book titled Rise and Fall of the American Teen by Thomas Hine
    [NPR broadcast] , the theory is presented that the proverbial &quot;teenager&quot; did not
    exist until the 1930s. Until that time, teenagers were too busy supporting the family,
    getting married, and having children. Nowadays, if I were to write my senator, correct my
    teacher, or start a business, people automatically assume that I am incapable. This is a
    stereotype that I have not established for myself; other teenagers have given me a
    reputation unbefitting of who I really am. By defacing a website, people have to listen.
    The volume of people that visit the site as it is defaced combined with the volume of
    people that view it mirrored is immense. Therefore, I have effectively gotten my message
    out, and people can choose to listen to it or not. If this sounds extremely selfish, I
    agree. The twist comes in the questions that people ask themselves. For instance, one of
    my motivations is enlightening system administrators. There has been many a case where I
    have noticed a vulnerablilty, mailed the admin, and his/her cockyness resulted in ignoring
    my warning. Two or three days later, I see this admin's page on the mirror. Sometimes, the
    best way to inform someone is to show them. Seeing is believing. The point is, if I can
    get at least one of the hundred people that see that site, including the administrator, to
    realize that security isn't all its cracked up to be and change their views, I have done
    my job. This line of thought is very common in the heads of most defacement practitioners.
    Second, I am a graffiti artist. I throw burners on walls and trains. I have ran with some
    infamous crews. I do not represent the &quot;tagging&quot; aspect [for the uninitiated,
    the equivalent of &quot;b0n3r oenz u&quot; on a defacement]. I strongly feel that graffiti
    can be very artistic and carry a very strong message if done correctly. People will pass
    by your piece and either love it or hate it. For that moment they take their mind off of
    their jobs, their children, their lives and they contemplate what they are looking at.
    This is very much so the purpose of web defacement in my eyes. Third, I don't care. I
    can't care. I haven't been raided, haven't stared down a lawman's gun, and haven't been
    investigated for computer crime. If any of these were to happen to me, I have no doubt in
    my mind I will see things in a different light. This ignorance is obviously not very
    healthy. I have weighed the consequences and see very little in favor of me stopping. I
    will most likely continue to deface until it gets old, I have nothing else to say, or
    simply don't have time. I would argue that ninety percent of web page defacements fall
    under this mindset. This is sad, but true. This is not to say that I or anyone else isn't
    aware of the rules. That assumption is far from the truth. What it means is that we are
    basically carefree in the sense that we could be arrested and still feel good about
    ourselves. ;) In a sense, it isn't worth it. There are only a few of us singlehandedly
    cracking with good intentions. The rest of the scene is too busy talking shit to each
    other or rm -rfing everything they can that there is a stereotype affiliated. As
    aforementioned, stereotypes are the ultimate backpedal to anything we accomplish. Just as
    teenagers are ignored and pigeonholed, everyone who totes a computer and investigates
    security will be labeled a threat. What does make it worth it? Arguably, the few who carry
    on the tradition. PHC and Narcissus - using their defacements as a political tool. DHC -
    putting an interesting poetic twist to their cracks. ULG - for making BIG statements on
    BIG sites. Last but not least, v00d00 - for his cynical views and unique style. There are
    others, no doubt, but these guys definately take the cake for originality and style - they
    have my respect. So next time you see my name or anyone else's pop up on attrition and
    wonder why we do it, think back to this article. Is it worth it? You decide.</font></small></p>
