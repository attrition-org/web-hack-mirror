  <i>War Industries are a bunch of trojan using frauds(as if you hadn't noticed).<br>
  </i><font size="3">brought to you by the pimp with a capital &quot;P&quot;.</font></h2>
<p> Hello, I'm here to tell you about a group of lamers who call themselves &quot;Mad 
  Hacker&quot;(gay name, eh?), &quot;System 33&quot;, &quot;Ph33r&quot;, &quot;r00ted&quot;, 
  and War industries. They registered a site on Hypermart.net(wiredconnection.net) 
  using fake info, put up a defaced site index to make them look like they cracked 
  a site, and used it to urge people to 'attack' their critics. Now, that doesn't 
  seem too cool if you ask me, if they want on Attrition's mirror that bad, all 
  they had to do is use their &quot;l33t&quot; script kiddie skills and deface 
  some obscure web server. I'm not trying to be cool, or &quot;l33t&quot; by doing 
  this, I'm just stating a point. Hopefully this group of prepubescant group of 
  horny 12 year olds, also known as &quot;War Industries&quot; will get their 
  act together soon. Down with the kiddie media whores! Oh, and good luck &quot;hacking&quot; 
  mediahype.cjb.net, but I don't think you can &quot;hack&quot; and a site with 
  winnuke. </p>

<p><b>/* UPDATE!!! */</b><br>
  This update was taken directly off the war industries website, now, if this 
  isn't proof on what lame kiddies they are, I don't know what is.<br>
  ----start of Wi2k update----<br>
  Posted by Ph33r (25.01.2000) Soon some new things will come up, i havn't realy 
  had time for it because im ill. Well, im thinking of starting a new section 
  (AOL) but i dont got much tools for it, so if anyone have tools for AOL just 
  email them to Ph33r. Also i have a fun thing for you to read, visit www.mediahype.cjb.net 
  wich is ran by Dj Silicon, wich hate us for some reason. He post fake logs and 
  shit about us and trying to close us down so pay him a visit and email him a 
  message with a couple of lines so he get bombed =) <br>
