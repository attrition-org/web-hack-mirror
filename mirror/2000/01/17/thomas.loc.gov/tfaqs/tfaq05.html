<strong>Q5. Why can't I find what I'm looking for in the section called <cite>Major Legislation</cite>?</strong><p>

The <strong>Major Legislation</strong> link on the THOMAS homepage is a "short cut".  It is not a comprehensive list of legislation.  Legislative analysts in the Congressional Research Service at the Library of Congress identify for inclusion here bills that have undergone floor action, hearings, debate and/or media attention.  There is naturally some element of subjectivity in any process of selection, so you may not find what you are looking for here.  Also, this link is not updated as fast as other links.  If you do not find what you are looking for in <strrong>Major Legislation</strong>, please try either <strong>Bill Text</strong> or <strong>Bill Summary & Status</strong>.<p>
 
The most popular section in <storng>Major Legislation</strong> is <cite>By topic</cite>.  Topics listed are derived from the <cite>LIV</cite>,  the <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/lexico/liv/brsearch.html">Legislative Indexing Vocabulary</a>.  If you do not see the topic you have in mind in the list presented on the <cite>By Topic</cite> link, look for an alternative term that might also describe the topic you are researching.<p>

Keep in mind that items are added to the topic list as a legislative session progresses.  That is, not all possible topics are displayed on the list at the beginning of a Congress.  Topics are added as bills touching that topic are deemed of major interest.<p>
