<strong>Q20. What's this about legislation imposing a tax or long distance telephone charge on internet access?</strong><p>
 
Any report of pending or actual Federal Legislation imposing a tax or long distance telephone charge on internet access is a <strong>hoax</strong>.<p>

No such legislation exists or has been introduced.<p>

Often this <strong>hoax</strong> is associated with a bill "602P" or "602p".  The numbering schene for identifying a particular Federal bill, resolution or law never includes an ending "P" or "p".<p> 

You can read about this <strong>hoax</strong> at the <a href="http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html#internetcharge">US Dept. of Energy Computer Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC)</a>site.<p>

Also, in response to erroneous reports that the FCC is planning to impose per minute usage charges on customer access to Internet Service Providers (ISP's), you can view these FCC Fact Sheets:<p>

<a href="http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Common_Carrier/Factsheets/nominute.html">No Comsumer Per-Minute Charges To Access ISPs</a><BR>
<a href="http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Common_Carrier/Factsheets/ispfact.html">The FCC, Internet Service Providers, and Access Charges</a><p>

Additionally, the <a href="http://www.usps.gov/news/press/99/99045new.htm">US Postal Service</a> in a recent Press Release officially disclaims any validity to the rumor of bogus legislation imposing the payment of an Internet e-mail fee.<p> 

Legislation has been introduced in the current Congress that calls for a <strong>reduction or elimination of telephone taxes</strong> -- to wit:<p>

<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d106:h.r.1234:">H.R. 1234</A><BR>
SPONSOR: Rep Miller, Gary (introduced 03/23/99)<BR>
A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the excise tax on telephone and other communications services.<p>

SPONSOR: Sen McCain, John (introduced 01/19/99)<BR> 
 A bill to repeal the telephone excise tax.<p>

Other legislation has been introduced that specifically calls for <strong>prohibiting tax on Internet access</strong>.  For example:<p>
