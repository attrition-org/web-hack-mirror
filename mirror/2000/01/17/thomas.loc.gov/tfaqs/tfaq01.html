<strong>Q1. How do I search in <cite>THOMAS</cite>?</strong><p>

The design of the <cite>THOMAS</cite> home page includes 3 areas for accessing and searching data.  Each area presents a particular focus:<p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>banner</strong> - Located across the top of the screen, this provides a <strong>quick way</strong> to access current House and Senate legislative activities, as well as input boxes for searching full bill text in the current Congress.<p>

<li>The <strong>center</strong> - <strong>Primary search arena</strong>; has 3 columns, "Legislation," <cite>Congressional Record</cite>, and "Committee Information."  Here's what you can expect to do under each column.<p>

   <ul>
        <li>"Legislation" - Search or browse the current *106th* or a *Previous* Congress for: bill summary text (not full bill text) back to 1973 and actual full bill text back to 1989, roll call vote information for the House back to 1990 and the Senate back to 1989, major legislation back to 1995 and public laws by law number back to 1973.<p>   

        <li><cite>Congressional Record</cite> - Search or browse the current *106th* or a *Previous* Congress for: most recent issue and all daily issues of this publication back to 1989 and its Index back to 1994, Resumes of Congressional activity back to 1969, and the historic <cite>Annals of Congress</cite>, 1789-1793.<p>   

        <li>"Committee Information" - Search or browse the current *106th* or a previous Congress for: full committee reports back to 1995, current committee home pages, House Committtees Schedules and Oversight Plans, and selected hearing transcripts.<p> 
      
   </ul>

<li>The <strong>left margin</strong> - Provides links to <strong>secondary resources</strong>, such as *Congress in the News*, *House and Senate Directories*, federal, legislative, executive and judicial branch Web sites, state and local government Web sites, authoritative documents explaining *The Legislative Process*, and also links to *Historical Documents*.<p>  

</ul>

<strong>Can I simply search through all Congresses at once for a particular bill or other document?</strong><p>

No, <cite>THOMAS</cite> stores bills and related documents under the Congress in which the item was introduced, enacted, reported, etc.  Therefore, you must search one Congress at a time for whatever it is you're looking for.<p>

<strong>What about searching a previous Congress?</strong><p>

From the <cite>THOMAS</cite> home page, you can initiate a search of a previous Congress for a particular database by clicking on the *Previous* link for that database.  This connects you to a Previous Congress selection screen where you can identify the particular Congress you wish to search.  This selection screen is grouped into individual database areas which list the previous congresses available for each database.   Simply find the database area you wish to search, then locate the particular Congress you are interested in, and click on that link.  This will connect you to the search screen for that Congress.<p>
