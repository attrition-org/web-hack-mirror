<strong>Q10. How do I find voting records of Members of Congress?</strong><p>
 
<cite>THOMAS</cite> does not maintain a separate database for voting records, but they are available through various links.<p>

Bear in mind that the House and Senate do not cast recorded votes on all bills.  In fact, many bills are voted on by voice vote and no record of who voted how is made.  For those bills and amendments for which votes are recorded by name, there are sources avaiable for accessing voting information using <cite>THOMAS</cite>.  Note, some of these sources are found at non-THOMAS public information web sites.<p>

From the <cite>THOMAS</cite> home page under the "Legislation" column at <strong>Roll Call Votes</strong>, you can initiate a search of vote information for either <strong>House</strong> or <strong>Senate</strong>.  Click on the Chamber (House or Senate) you wish to search.  The next screen lists Congresses and Sessions from the current 106th Congress 1st Session back to the 101st Congress 2nd Session (1990). Click on the Congress and Session you are interested in.  The next screen lists roll call information, arranged in descending (latest first) roll call number order for that Congress and Session.  Find the roll call number/bill number you're interested in and click on that link.<p> 

Additional detailed information on <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/votes/member.html">Compiling A Member Voting Record</a> is also available in <cite>THOMAS</cite>.<p>
