<strong>Q2. How do I find actual text of legislation passed before 1989 and other historical information?</strong><p>

There are probably no web sites with a comprehensive, full text database of legislation introduced into Congress before 1989.  <cite>THOMAS</cite> does have summary information under <strong>Bill Summary & Status</strong> for legislation introduced since 1973.  This does not contain full text of bills.<p>

From <cite>THOMAS</cite> you can also access <a href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwac.html">Annals of Congress</a>, 1789-1793</cite>, early precursors to the Congressional Record.<p>

For government research or possible information on obtaining a print copy of the text of a legislative document prior to 1989, via a Federal Depository Library (FDL) nearest you, visit the <a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/dpos/adpos004.html">FDL Program</a> web site.  Or, you can contact the Gov't Printing Office at any of the following.  <cite>(Caution: The Gov't Printing Office web site, <strong>GPO Access</strong>, is a large omnibus site and you may experience long delays.)</cite>
<ul>
   <li><cite>toll free phone:</cite> 1-888-293-6498
   <li><cite>web site:</cite> <a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov">GPO Access</a>
   <li><cite>email:</cite> gpoaccess@gpo.gov<p>
</ul>

The <strong>United States Code</strong>, the body of federal law into which bills signed into law eventually find their place. is online from several sources, e.g. the <a href="http://law.house.gov/">House of Representatives Internet Law Library</a> and <a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov">GPO Access</a>.  There are no links available in <cite>THOMAS</cite> or any other internet site which map a given public law to its place in the <strong>United States Code</strong>.<p>

Also, the U.S. House of Representatives Clerk's Office provides a very useful <strong>Congressional archives</strong> searching tool entitled, <a href="http://clerkweb.house.gov/histrecs/history/history.htm">Historical Information</a>.<p>
