<strong>Q19. Any suggestions for citation models of documents viewed from <cite>THOMAS</cite>?</strong><p>

The University of
Memphis Government Publications Department has a page entitled:
"Uncle Sam: Brief Guide to Citing Government Publications,"
which includes a section on citing <a href="http://www.lib.memphis.edu/gpo/citeweb.htm">online government publications</a>.<p>

At the bottom of the University of Memphis page
mentioned above, there are "Hot Links" to several additional
online electronic style guides.<p>

They give the basic citation form for online sources as:<p>

Author, Title (edition), TYPE OF MEDIUM.  Date of publication.  Supplier. Available: [online address]. [Access date.]<p>

An example for the <cite>Congressional Record</cite>:<p>

Ford, Rep. [TN] "Tribute to Rhodes College Mock Trial Team." <cite>Congressional Record</cite>. ONLINE. 25 May 1995.  THOMAS.  Available: http://thomas.loc.gov/home/r104query.html [2 February 1999].<p>

An example for a Congressional bill:<p>
 
U.S. House. 104th Congress, 1st Session, H.R. 1950, <cite>Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1995</cite>, as introduced in the House.  ONLINE. THOMAS. Available: http://thomas.loc.gov/home/c104query.html [2 February 1999].<p>

An example of a Committee Report:<p>
 
U.S. House. Committee on the Judiciary. <cite>Proposing an Amendment to
the Constitution of the United States with Respect to Tax Limitations</cite> (to accompany H.J.Res.62). (H. Rpt. 105-50). ONLINE.  THOMAS. Available: http://thomas.loc.gov/home/cp105/cp105query.html [2 February 1999].<p>

<center>(End of suggestions for citation models)</center><p>

In the last several years, several online style guides have 
been published in paper.  Perhaps the best known is:<p>

Li, X., & Crane, N. B. (1996). Electronic styles: A handbook for citing
electronic information (Revised edition). Medford, NJ: Information Today.
[ISBN: 1-57387-027-7, $19.99]<p>
