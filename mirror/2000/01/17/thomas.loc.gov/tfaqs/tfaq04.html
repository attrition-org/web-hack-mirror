<strong>Q4. How do I find all bills sponsored or cosponsored by a Representative or Senator?</strong><p>
 
From the <cite>THOMAS</cite> home page go to the "Legislation" column and under <strong>Bill Summary & Status</strong> click on the Congress you are interested in.<p>  

NOTE: If you're interested in a previous Congress, click *Previous* and at the next screen at the <strong>Bill Summary & Status</strong> area, click on the Congress you want.  The next screen is the Bill Summary & Status search page for the Congress you're interested in.<p>

<strong>If you're simply interested in identifying all bills sponsored/cosponsored by a Member of Congress,</strong> the quickest way is to go to the line at the top of the search page that starts "Browse:" and click on the link to "Sponsors/Cosponsors".  The next screen lists all House and Senate Members with hot links to all bills spnsored and cosponored by each.<p>   

<strong>If you're interested in limiting your search to, say, only bills on a particular subject (e.g. environment) sponsored/copsonsored by a Member of Congress,</strong> go to the section of the page called "1. <cite>Word/Phrase</cite>" and in the box under that label enter your search term.  Then scroll down to "6. <cite>Sponsor/Cosponsor</cite>".  There you will see two selection boxes, one for the Senate, and one for the House, where the names of all members of each chamber are listed in alphabetical order.  Click on the name(s) of interest to you. <p> 

NOTE: There are three "radio" buttons in the selection boxes: <cite>Sponsored</cite>, <cite>Cosponsored</cite>, and <cite>Sponsored/Cosponsored</cite>.  The default box is <cite>Sponsored</cite>.  If you are interested in bills a Member of Congress has both sponsored and co-sponsored, you must click that box.  (Each bill has one sponsor.  Each bill may or may not have multiple cosponsors).<p>

When you have finished making your selection(s), click the Search button.<p>

Also, when you have the <cite>Sponsored/Cosponsored</cite> section on your screen, you can obtain additional information by clicking on the <cite>HELP Searching Multiple Sponsors</cite> link.<p>
