<strong>Q6. How do I link a particular part of THOMAS to my own web site?</strong><p>

Bear in mind that since <cite>THOMAS</cite> provides access to information about federal legislation which is in the public domain, <strong>no special permission is required</strong> to use (e.g. photocopy, build permanent links to, etc.) the data, or the <cite>THOMAS</cite> web site itself.<p>

The URL addresses you see when you execute a search, are temporary addresses and will expire in about 30 minutes.  However, you may wish to establish a permanent link to a bill, a committee report, a list of bills sponsored by a member of Congress, or some other search result without having to re-execute the search every time.  Detailed information about how to do this can be accessed from the <cite>THOMAS</cite> homepage by clicking on <cite>About THOMAS</cite> and at the next screen clicking on <cite>About InQuery</cite>.  There it is explained in the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/example.html">Web Developer's Guide on How To Make Direct Links to THOMAS Documents</a>.<p>
