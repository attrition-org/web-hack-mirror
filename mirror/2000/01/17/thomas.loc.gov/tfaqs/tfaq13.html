<strong>Q12. How often are Bill Text, the <cite>Congressional Record</cite>, and Committee Reports updated in <cite>THOMAS</cite>?</strong><p>

The text of bills, the Congressional Record and Committee Reports are first processed by the Government Printing Office (GPO) before they are transmitted electronically to the Library of Congress, which makes them available for online retrieval on THOMAS. Data received by the Library from GPO must also be processed  for use by THOMAS' underlying vendor-supplied retrieval engine, called InQuery.<p>

The Congressional Record is updated the most rapidly of the three. GPO processes a day's proceedings from the Senate and House overnight and usually transmits them to THOMAS by 9 a.m. (or earlier) the next day. The text is normally available online about one hour later.<p>

The processing of bill text takes a little longer. GPO usually needs one or more days to process the official bill text and to digitize it for transmission. Early in the session, when a very large number of bills are introduced, the process may take longer. When the text is lengthy, the process may also take longer. Once the Library of Congress receives the text from GPO, and processes it for InQuery, it becomes available online within a few hours.<p>

The time line for the availability of Committee Reports is less predictable. Reports  released by the Committees are sent first to GPO, which may take several days to properly format them. Reports are generally available online in THOMAS  about an hour after they have been received from GPO, but can be delayed when there is the need for manual adjustments to the text.<p>

While GPO is very efficient in processing large volumes of information day after day, technical problems can sometimes delay delivery to the Library. Also, on occasion, THOMAS may not receive a particular item due to  an electronic transfer failure. In such instances you may be able to find the missing data by directly checking GPO's web site at <a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov">GPO Access</a>.<p> 

The notation "Last Updated" followed by a particular date that appears  near the bottom of some THOMAS web pages, does not reflect the currency of the data displayed. Rather, it indicates the last time that the particular web page itself was changed,  e.g. the text modified or reformatted, links added, etc.<p>
