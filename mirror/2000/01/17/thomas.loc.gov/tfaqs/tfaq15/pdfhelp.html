<a name="what"><strong>What is a PDF File?</strong></a><br>
 <strong>PDF</strong> stands for <strong>P</strong>ortable <strong>D</strong>ocument <strong>F</strong>ormat.  It is a proprietary file 
format developed by Adobe  Systems  for viewing electronic copies of 
paper documents.  It has become a <i>de facto</i> standard, and its 
use is particularly widespread on the Web.

<p><a name="why"><strong>Why use PDF?</strong></a><br>

PDF has become a very popular format for several reasons.  It allows an exact copy, replicating  the layout -- including fonts, tables, graphics, page numbers and colors -- of the paper document.  A PDF document captures the "look and feel" that has become associated with well-known paper publications, for example, the Government Printing Office (GPO) hard-copy publications of bills and committee reports.  But, more important in accounting for its great popularity, the software required for reading these PDF documents on the Web -- the Adobe Acrobat Reader -- is freely available.

<p><a name="how"><strong> Reading PDF Files with Your Web Browser</strong></a><br>
The THOMAS site links to GPO-created PDF files of bills and committee reports.  To view,  navigate, and/or print bills or committee reports in PDF format, you will need the Adobe Acrobat software.  Obtain Adobe Acrobat from the Adobe Web site.  Follow the instructions to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html">download</a> and install the latest version of the Reader (3.01) on your pc.  To use the Adobe Reader as a <a href="#plugin">plug-in</a>, you need a later version of a Web browser, e.g., Netscape 3.0 or above.  Follow the instructions to <a href="http://home.netscape.com/download/download_instructions.html">download
</a> and install the latest version of Netscape (Navigator 4.0) to your pc.

<p><i>The following basic tips are written for Adobe Acrobat Reader version 3.01 and Netscape Navigator 
4.0 for  Windows.</i>  Acrobat Reader should run comparably on other Windows-based browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, or on other graphical platforms, such as the Macintosh,  but the functionality may differ slightly based on the version of the Adobe Reader, the "brand" and version of Web browser you are running, its configuration,  and the configuration of your pc. </P>

<p>You can configure the Adobe Acrobat Reader to work under Netscape in two ways:  as a <a href="#plugin">"plug-in"</a> or as a <a href="#helper">"helper application."</a>  

<p><a name="plugin"><b>USING THE ADOBE ACROBAT READER as a  PLUG-IN</b></a>
<P>If you are running Netscape 3.0 or Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher, 
and you download and install the Adobe 3.01 reader, or if the Acrobat 
Reader is already on your hard drive when you install a new version of 
the browser, the browser  automatically configures the Reader as a "plug-in" 
application.   Plug-ins are software programs that extend the 
capabilities of your Web browser in a specific way - giving you, 
for example, the ability to play audio samples or view video movies 
or read PDF files  from <b>within</b> the browser's window, and 
you can use your browser's <code>BACK</code> button to return to your 
previously viewed Web page.  

<p>If you run the PDF reader as a plug-in under Netscape, your screen will look similar to this:</p>

<img src="bill1.gif"  align="center" alt="[View of Adobe Reader as Plug-In under Netscape]">

<p><center><a name="toolbar"><strong>The Adobe Reader Toolbar</strong></a></center>
<p>When Adobe Reader is run as a plug-in, the top row of buttons 
showing on the page is part of the Netscape browser interface; those 
buttons invoke Netscape-specific  features and functionality.  But, 
in the page view above, notice that the Adobe Reader  "toolbar" -- a row of feature buttons for viewing, printing, and navigating the PDF file -- appears <b>within</b> the Netscape browser window, below the Netscape "Location" bar.  These buttons invoke Acrobat Reader features and functions.

<p><a name="helper"><strong>USING THE ADOBE READER as a HELPER APPLICATION</strong></a>
<p>For older versions of Netscape (3.0 and below), when the browser encounters a sound, image, video file, 
of PDF file, it hands off the data to other programs, called helper applications, to run or display the file.  When 
the Adobe Reader is configured as a helper application, the browser actually spawns a separate window and launches Acrobat <b>within</b> that separate window -- not within the Netscape window -- to display 
the PDF file.  (When you wish to return to the Web page you were previously viewing, close the Reader window [by clicking on the "X" in the upper 
righthand corner or by selecting <i>File</i>, then <i>Exit</i> from the menu bar] to return to Netscape.  Alternatively, you can "switch" applications by clicking on the open Netscape window.  This leaves Adobe Acrobat open and running in the background.)

Here is a view of Netscape 3.0 launching the Adobe Reader in its own window:

<p><center><img src="helpapp4.gif" alt="[Acrobat as a Helper App]"></center>

<p><b>HOW TO CONFIGURE ADOBE ACROBAT as a HELPER APPLICATION</b>

<p>The following example screen shots are for Netscape 3.0.  

<p>From the Netscape "Options" menu, choose "General Preferences,"  then the "Helpers" tab.

<p><center><img src="helpapp1.gif" alt="[Netscape Options Menu]"></center>

<p>A pop-up "Preferences" dialog box appears.  Click on "Create New 
Type."  A secondary box appears prompting for the <b><i>MIME 
Type</i></b> -- type <code>application</code>  -- and <b><i>MIME 
Subtype</i></b> -- 
type <code>pdf</code>.  Then click "OK."

<p><center><img src="helpapp2.gif" alt="[Netscape MIME 
Type Dialog Box]"></center>

<p>In the "Preferences" dialog box, type the <b><i>File Extension</i>
</b> -- <code>pdf</code>  -- and the path where  the Adobe Acrobat 
Reader is found on your hard drive (you may have to use the 
"Browse" button find the path].  Finally, choose whether you want to 
"Launch the Application" to bring up Acrobat in its own window when 
you encounter a PDF file, or merely "Save to disk."  You can then 
bring up the PDF file later after starting the Adobe Reader from your 
desktop.

<p><center><img src="helpapp3.gif" alt="[Netscape Preferences Dialog Box]"></center>

<p>For additional help with the features and functionality of the Adobe Reader, pull-down <i>Help</i> menu in the Acrobat Reader and select <i>Reader Online Guide</i>.
