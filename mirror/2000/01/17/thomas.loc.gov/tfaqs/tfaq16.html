<strong>Q16. In the THOMAS Bill Text files, how do I identify the latest 
version of a bill's text?</strong><p>

<p>On its way to becoming a law, a bill completes a number 
of stages in the legislative process.  The completion of a particular
stage is reflected by the creation of a new bill version.
However, not all bills complete all stages in the legislative process.  In
fact, the majority of bills never make it farther than the first stage,
and thus have only one version (introduced).

<p>Below is a list of the most common versions of bills in the 
<strong>chronological</strong> order they appear in the legislative process.  
Not all bills will have all the versions set forth below.  Click on the 
active links for a definition of that bill version.  For a more complete
explanation of the stages in the legislative process, see

Process</a></i>.

<p align="center"><b>DEFINITIONS OF BILL VERSIONS</b></p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="introduced"><b>Introduced in the House (or Senate):</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Representatives and Senators 
formally present a bill or resolution to their respective chambers by delivering it to a clerk on the floor of their chamber when that chamber is in session -- thus <i>introducing</i> the measure.  Both the House and Senate permit 
any number of Members to take part in introducing a measure -- the first 
Member listed is considered the <b>sponsor</b>, the others <b>cosponsors</b>.  
Often a bill is written in committee or subcommittee, and then introduced or sponsored by the Committee Chair and sometimes cosponsored by other committee 
members.</dd>

<p><dt><a name="referred"><b>Referred in the House (or Senate):</b></a></dt>
<dd>After a measure is introduced in the House or Senate, it is almost always 
sent to the Committee that has jurisdiction over the subject matter in the 
bill, as defined by House and Senate rules and precedents. In the House, the 
Speaker officially refers each measure; in the Senate, this official duty 
belongs to the <i>president of the Senate</i> or the <i>president pro 
tempore</i>.  In practice, however, those officers delegate referral duties 
to the House and Senate Parliamentarians, and usually get involved only 
when there is a disputed referral. 

<p>In the House, the Speaker must refer a bill to the committee with primary 
jurisdiction over its subject matter, but he is authorized to refer the bill 
sequentially to additional committees -- <i>sequential referrals</i>. In the 
Senate, a bill dealing with several subjects may be assigned 
concurrently to several committees -- a <i>joint referral</i>. Multiple 
referrals are much more common in the House than in the Senate, 
where in practice, they are made only by unanimous consent. 


<p>Measures are usually referred on the day that they are introduced.  
At the beginning of a session, however, the number of bills is so large, 
it might take several days to refer them all to the proper committee.

<p>Sometimes a bill or resolution is not referred to committee at all, 
especially if it is expected that the House or Senate will consider it on 
the floor in the near future.

<p><dt><a name="reported"><b>Reported in the House (or Senate):</b></a></dt>
<dd>The committee may vote to approve or "report" the bill favorably 
(i.e., recommending passage) for further deliberation by the full House or 
Senate on the floor.  On some occasions, a committee may report a bill 
unfavorably (recommending against passage); however, the committee is much 
more likely to take no action on a bill it opposes, allowing the bill to die 
at the end of the Congress.  The reported bill is generally printed with 
any committee amendments, indicating the insertions and deletions that each 
committee amendment would make.  The reported version carries the report 
number and the date the measure was formally reported. 

<p>If a House committee proposes major amendments to a bill that was referred 
to it, the committee may scrap the original bill and report a "clean bill" 
that the committee chairman proposes and that incorporates all the propoposed 
amendments.  The clean bill is a different bill with a different number from 
that of the bill the committee had considered and marked up. 

<p>Senate committees have the authority to report "original" bills -- bills 
that the committees wrote without the bills first having been introduced and 
referred to them.  When a Senate committee reports such an original bill, it 
is introduced and assigned a number at the same time it is reported.  Only a 
few House committees, such as the Committees on Appropriations and Rules, 
have this authority.

<p>Technically, the final vote in committee is to order the bill reported.  
The bill actually is reported back to the House or Senate when the committee 
chairman returns it to an official of his or her chamber, usually with the 
accompanying written report that discusses the bill and its provisions.

<p>The committee's report summarizes the purpose of a bill and the reasons 
for its approval, sets forth the committee's findings and recommendations, 
and includes the text of any amendments to the bill that the committee 
proposes.  The report also contains executive agency comments and a 
statement estimating the costs (or revenues) resulting from the bill's 
potential enactment for the current fiscal year and five successive 
fiscal years. All changes in existing law usually are indicated in the 
report, as well as the text of laws being repealed.  <i>See also</i> <a href="/home/definitions/reported.html">"Reporting a Measure."</a></dd> 

<p><dt><a name="calendar"><b>Placed on the House (or Senate) Calendar</b></a></dt>
<dd>A calendar is a list of measures -- most of them favorably 
<a href="/home/definitions/reported.html">reported</a> by committees -- 
that are eligible for <a href="/home/definitions/floor.html">floor</a> 
consideration.  

<p>Once a bill has been <a href="/home/definitions/reported.html">reported</a> 
in the House, it is placed on one of the legislative calendars: 
<ol>
   <li> Union Calendar: for authorization and appropriations bills and bills raising revenues; 
   <li> House Calendar: for all other public bills and resolutions; 
   <li> Corrections Calendar: created during the 104th Congress. Measures 
must first have been <a href="/home/definitions/reported.html">reported</a> 
by the committee of jurisdiction and placed on either the House or Union 
Calendar. After consulting with the minority leader, the Speaker of the 
House then decides which bills are to be placed on the Corrections Calendar. 
Bills and resolutions on this calendar are considered on the House floor 
on the second and fourth Tuesday of each month. Amendments are restricted, 
and the measure must pass by a three-fifths vote. Measures failing to pass 
remain on the calendar to which they were originally assigned. 
   <li> Private Calendar: for bills of a private nature that usually are passed without debate, e.g., for the relief of an individual with a claim against 
the federal government, immigration of individual(s), etc. -- scheduled 
for the first and third Tuesdays of each month; or 
   <li> Discharge Calendar: for <a href="/home/definitions/motion.html">
motions</a> to discharge committees from further consideration of measures 
referred to them. In the House, if a committee does not <a href= 
"/home/definitions/reported.html">report a bill</a> within 30 days after 
the measure was referred to it, any member may file a discharge <a href="/home/definitions/motion.html">motion.</a> This motion, treated as a petition, 
needs the signatures of 218 members (a majority of the House). Occasionally, 
to expedite non-controversial legislative business, a committee is discharged 
by unanimous consent of the House, and a petition is not required. 

</ol>
<p>In the Senate, only one legislative calendar is kept, and one 
"executive" calendar -- for treaties and nominations submitted to the Senate 
for consideration. 

<p>Each chamber decides which measures and matters it will take up -- bring up for <a href="/home/definitions/floor.html">floor</a> consideration -- 
and in what order, according to its rules, precedents, and practices.</dd>

<p><dt><a name="agreed"><b>Agreed to by the House (or Senate):</b></a></dt>
<dd>This term is used to describe approval by one chamber or the other of 
<a href= "/home/definitions/conres.html">concurrent resolutions</a> 
(H.Con.Res. or S.Con.Res.) or <a href = "/home/definitions/simple_res.html">
simple  resolutions</a> (H.Res. or S.Res.).  These types of measures are said 
to be "agreed to," unlike House and Senate bills (i.e., H.R. and S.), which 
are said to be "passed."  When the House or Senate agrees to a simple resolution, that constitutes final action on the resolution because the other chamber 
does not act on it. "Agreed to" also is the parliamentary term for the 
approval of <a href="/home/definitions/motion.html">motions</a> and 
amendments.</dd>

<p>
<dt><a name="engrossed"><b>Engrossed in the House (or Senate):</b></a></dt>
<dd>An engrossed bill is the official copy of a bill or joint resolution 
that has been passed by <b>one</b> chamber, including the text as changed 
by any amendments that have been agreed to on the <a href= 
"/home/definitions/floor.html">floor</a>, and certified by the 
Clerk of the House or the Secretary of the Senate.  The House's engrossed 
documents are printed on blue paper; the Senate's on white paper.</dd>

<p><dt><a name="received"><b>Received in the House (or Senate):</b></a></dt>
<dd>Once the House or Senate approves a measure (other than a simple 
resolution), it is sent to the other chamber for consideration, where it is 
received and reprinted.  

<p><dt><a name="engrossedamend"><b>Engrossed House (or  Senate) Amendment</b>:</a></dt>
<dd>The formal printed copy of amendments that one chamber has adopted to a 
measure or amendments of the other.  An "amendment in the nature of a 
substitute" proposes to replace the entire text of a  measure.  It strikes 
out everything after the enacting clause and replaces it with text that may be 
somewhat, substantially, or totally different.</dd>

<p><dt><a name="publicprint"><b>House Appropriations Bill as Passed Senate (Public Print):</b></a>
<dd>The House of Representatives lays claim to the exclusive right to originate appropriations bills.  While the Senate denies this claim in theory, it accepts it in practice.  Nevertheless, like all legislation, 
appropriations bills must pass both houses of Congress to be enacted into law.  

<p>A public print is based on three versions of the bill: 1) the engrossed 
version of an appropriations bill from the House (that is, the House-passed 
version); 2) numbered engrossed amendments to the bill from the Senate 
(that is, Senate-passed amendments); 3) the reported version of the Senate bill.

A public print is "ordered to be printed with [engrossed] amendments of the 
Senate numbered."  The intent was to show the differences between the House 
bill and the Senate-amended version.  When there were many hundreds of 
amendments, the public print consisted of the text of the House bill 
interspersed with bold numbers (<b>1, 2, 3, 4</b>, etc.) showing where the
 text of the engrossed Senate amendments was to be interpolated. To expedite 
matters and make things more straightforward 
for the Senate Enrolling Clerk, the Senate began to pass it own bill (with a 
Senate bill number), incorporating its engrossed amendments, then amend the 
House bill (with the House bill number) by striking all after the enacting 
clause and substituting the text of the Senate-passed bill (that is, "the 
<b>one</b> amendment of the Senate numbered" (the one engrossed Senate 
amendment in the nature of a substitute which consisted of the entire text of 
the Senate bill).  The result is a bill with the bill number of the House 
appropriations bill, but the text of the Senate bill.  

<p>A public print is the version printed before the appropriations bill goes 
to <a href="/home/definitions/bills_in_conference.html">conference</a> for 
reconciliation between the two houses of Congress.</dd>

<p><dt><a name="enrolled"><b>Enrolled Bill:</b></a></dt>
<DD>The <STRONG>enrolled bill</STRONG> is the final copy of the bill that 
has been passed in identical form by both the House and Senate.  It is printed 
on parchment, certified by an officer of the house of origin (Clerk of the 
House or Secretary of the Senate) and then signed by and the President of 
the Senate, and then presented to the President for his signature or veto.
<p>The text of the enrolled bill contains all the provisions that take effect 
if and when the bill becomes law unless the bill was vetoed or pocket-vetoed.
