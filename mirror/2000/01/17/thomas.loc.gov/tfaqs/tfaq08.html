<strong>Q8. How do I find out what is currently the law of the land on a particular subject?</strong><p>

From the <cite>THOMAS</cite> home page under the "Legislation" column, if you initiate a search under <strong>Bill Text</strong>, <cite>THOMAS</cite> offers access to the full text of Public Laws back to 1989.  Under <strong>Bill Summary & Status</strong>, access to the text of bill digests back to 1973 is available.<p>

 Access to the <strong>United States Code</strong>, or what is commonly referred to as "the law of the land", is available from <cite>THOMAS</cite> through non-<cite>THOMAS</cite> links.<p> 

The <strong>United States Code</strong> (or <strong>USC</strong>) is the body of federal law into which bills signed into law eventually find their place.  Here all general and permanent laws are codified and published in 50 titles, according to subject matter.  This information is available from various online sources, e.g. the <a href="http://law.house.gov/">House of Representatives Internet Law Library</a> and through a local Federal Depository Library near you via <a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov">GPO ACCESS</a>.<p>
