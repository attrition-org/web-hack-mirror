<strong>Q14. Why is the <cite>THOMAS</cite> server not working properly, and why am I getting error messages?</strong><p>
 
If the problem is ...<p>
<ul>
     <li> <strong>Slow response</strong><p>

            <cite>Action(s)</cite>:<p>
            
<strong>*</strong> If this occurred between 10-11 a.m. or 4-5 p.m. e.d.t. during a week day, this is our busiest usage time.  Try <cite>THOMAS</cite> later.<p>

<strong>*</strong> If your browser will allow it, turn off your graphics function.  Try <cite>THOMAS</cite> again.<p>

<strong>*</strong> Clear your browser by turning it off and then on.  Try <cite>THOMAS</cite> again.<p>

<strong>*</strong> If your system has a "ping" command, you might try seeing what your  path is to <cite>http://thomas.loc.gov</cite> or if and where it hangs up.<p> 

     <li> <strong>Received "Fatal Error 500"</strong><p>

            <cite>Action:</cite>:<p>

<strong>*</strong> This is a universal transient error on the internet.  Try <cite>THOMAS</cite> again.<p>

     <li> <strong>Received "Server Error" message attempting a GPO PDF copy</strong><p>

            <cite>Action</cite>:<p>

<strong>*</strong> This pdf function extracts documents from the GPO site.  An error message here indicates the bill which you are attempting to copy has not been completed for pdf copying by GPO.  <cite>THOMAS</cite> has no control over this availability.  Try later.<p>

     <li> <strong>Can't connect to the House link</strong><p>

            <cite>Action</cite>:<p>

<strong>*</strong> Try other non-THOMAS web sites.  At the bottom of the <cite>THOMAS</cite> homepage go to the <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/global/legislative/congress.html">U.S. Legislative Branch</a> web site.  Or try the <a href="http://www.house.gov">U.S. House of Representatives</a> homepage.<p>

     <li> <strong>Unable to find retrieved information in display of the <cite>Congressional Record</cite> or a committee report </strong><p>

            <cite>Action</cite>:<p>
<strong>*</strong> When a retrieved document is so large that it cannot be entirely displayed on a single web page, the <cite>Forward</cite> option is highlighted (located near the bottom as well as near the top of this display screen).  This indicates to the user that the document exceeds more than the current web page and that after scrolling to the bottom of the current portion of the retrieved document, the next portion can be viewed by clicking the <cite>Forward</cite> button.<p>

</ul>
