      breakfast meeting of the year this morning at Union Café in Union
      Station. Speakers included Senator Bill Kenney, Representative Randall
      Relford, and Representative Bill Tudor. The legislators spoke about the
      upcoming session, their specific priorities and their thoughts regarding
      The Chamber’s Public Policy Agenda. All three legislators addressed the
      subject of highway funding, with Rep. Relford noting, &quot;There are
      streets in my small town that ride more smoothly than spots of I-70.
      Commerce, my family, and your families all ride on those roads – they’re
      not safe and we need to do something about it.&quot;</font></p>
