      <p>Nominations are now open for The Chamber’s <i>Top 10 Small Businesses
      of the Year.</i> This annual awards celebration honors the true
      &quot;engine&quot; of the Greater Kansas City economy: small business.</p>
      <p>To be nominated, a business must be for-profit and headquartered in the
      Greater Kansas City area, with no more than 250 full-time employees and a
      minimum of three years in business.</p>
      <p>Success in business is just one of the criteria used to select the <i>Top
      10 Small Businesses.</i> In addition, those businesses must exhibit a
      commitment to good business practices, and a history of both good employee
      relations and service to the community.</p>
      <p>One of the <i>Top 10</i> will receive the top honor – the &quot;Mr.
      K. Award,&quot; named after famed entrepreneur Ewing Kauffman. Each
      spring, The Chamber’s Metropolitan Entrepreneurs Council (MEC) hosts a
      series of events honoring small business. This year, activities begin
      March 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2000, with the <i>Top 10 Candidates Showcase,</i>
      and culminate May 12, 2000, with the <i>14<sup>th</sup> Annual Small
      Business Celebration Awards Luncheon.</p>
      </i>
      <p>The deadline for nominations is December 17, 1999. More information and
