    with all it has to offer. </p>
    <p>Kansas Citians enjoy a standard of living higher than most at a cost of living lower
    than most. Friendly and down-to-earth, the city is also surprising cosmopolitan. <br>
    A careful regard for beauty is evident throughout the city's boulevards, lavish fountains,
    spacious parks and attractive business centers. </p>
    <p>Arts and entertainment run the gamut from the highly acclaimed Nelson-Atkins Museum of
    Art and Missouri Repertory Theatre to the city's crown jewels of professional sports, the
    Kansas City Chiefs football and Royals baseball teams. </p>
    <p>Add in affordable housing, excellent schools and a strong, stable economy to see why
    Kansas City really has the good life. </p>
    <p><font size="+2"><b>We're the Heart of America </b></font></p>
    <p><img align="left" vspace="5" src="kcusa.gif" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="167"> Kansas City is the most centrally located
    principal U.S. city. Founded as a river landing at the confluence of the Missouri and
    Kansas rivers, Kansas City is now a bistate community of 1.6 million residents. The
    central city is Kansas City, Missouri, but the metro area encompasses 4,777.4 square miles
    and 144 municipalities in seven counties of Missouri and four counties of Kansas. </p>
    <p><font size="+2"><b>The good life costs less</b></font> </p>
    <p>Although enjoying an exceptionally high standard of living, Greater Kansas City is very
    affordable, with one of the lowest costs of living of all major U.S. cities. The area
    consistently ranks below the national average in costs of housing, transportation, food
    and utilities. </p>
    <p>The city was named the country's No. 1 most affordable housing market by Ernst &amp;
    Young and the National Real Estate Index in their 1993 Study of Housing Costs. Plus,
    Greater Kansas City is the first major city to have earned clean air status from the
    E.P.A. </p>
    <p><font size="+2"><b>Strong mix of commerce and industry</b></font> </p>
    <p>With a diverse and growing economy, Greater Kansas City is a center for financial
    services, communications, health care, law, education and government, which is the area's
    largest employer. Warehousing, manufacturing and distribution are also major industries,
    thanks to Kansas City's central location and abundant intermodal freight resources.
    Agribusiness is also strong, particularly in management and research. </p>
    <p>Fortune 500 giants Farmland Industries, Sprint, Yellow Corp. UtiliCorp United and
    Payless Cashways are headquartered here, along with locally grown Hallmark Cards, Hoechst
    Marion Roussell, H&amp;R Block, Twentieth Century Services, Kansas City Southern
    Industries, Interstate Bakeries, Russell Stover Candies, Seaboard Corp. and Kansas City
    Power and Light. </p>
    <p>Inc. named Kansas City one of the best places to own a business, calling the city
    &quot;an entrepreneur's dream.&quot; Entrepreneur ranked the city one of the top 10 places
    in the U.S. for small business. </p>
    <p><font size="+2"><b>Enjoy classics to jazz, shopping to sports</b></font> </p>
    <p><img align="left" vspace="5" src="royals.gif" WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="130"> Greater Kansas City's arts and
    entertainment options range from an internationally famous art museum, highly acclaimed
    repertory theater, symphony orchestra, lyric opera and state ballet to six professional
    sports teams: Chiefs football, Royals baseball, Blades hockey, Attack indoor soccer, Wiz
    outdoor soccer and Explorers tennis. There's also professional car, dog and horse racing
    and river boat gaming. </p>
    <p>Kansas City has more professional theater than any U.S. city its size. Outdoor rock
    concerts, blues and jazz clubs, a new zoo and the Harry S. Truman Library are other
    popular choices. </p>
    <p><img align="left" src="lion.gif" WIDTH="110" HEIGHT="100"> Outdoor enthusiasts love the area's 24 public lakes,
    200 public parks, Worlds of Fun theme park and Oceans of Fun water park. </p>
    <p>The Country Club Plaza shopping district, dubbed the &quot;Rodeo Drive of the
    Midwest,&quot; and Kansas City's world-famous steaks and barbecue draw visitors from a
    four-state region. </p>
