        <p>NOTE: $25 of your annual Chamber investment is applied toward a subscription to the
        Kansas Citian </p>
        <p><b>Investment Schedule</b> <br>
        The cost of membership is calculated by type of business, number of employees and role
        within the area economy. Members are expected to adhere to the following formula,
        developed by the Board of Directors. </p>
        <p><b>Calculating Your Investment</b> <br>
        The base or minimum membership cost is $400 annually, plus a one-time initiation fee. </p>
        <p><b>Step 1.</b> Locate the appropriate schedule for your type of business - see below.
        Figure your investment by the formula specified. Employee count should reflect the number
        of full-time equivalent, permanent employees in the metropolitan area. (Two half-time
        employees equals one full-time, etc.) Seasonal employee calculations should be based on
        average employee number. </p>
        <p><b>Step 2.</b> Headquartered firms, add 20 percent to your total investment. </p>
        <p><b>Step 3.</b> Companies falling between $1,000 and $4,999, add an additional five
        percent. Companies at $5,000 or more should add 25 percent, by request of the Board of
        Directors. </p>
        <p><b>Not-For-Profits</b> <br>
        Not-For-Profit organizations may invest half the calculated investment but a minimum of
        $400. </p>
        <p><b>NOTE: Investments may be tax deductible as a necessary business expense but are not
        deductible as a charitable contribution. However, 25 percent of the investment is
        non-deductible lobbying expense.</b> </p>
        <p><b>Schedule A</b> <br>
