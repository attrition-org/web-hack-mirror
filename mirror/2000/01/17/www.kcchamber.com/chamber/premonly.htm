        Here's another great benefit of Chamber membership. The Chamber's Premium Only Plan can
        save you and your employees money. Here's how: </p>
        <p><i>The Premium Only Plan lets you cut payroll taxes without cutting your payroll</i> </p>
        <p>The Section 125 Premium Only Plan (POP) saves you and your employees money by reducing
        payroll taxes. It works by making one simple adjustment in your payroll process: Employees
        pay their portion of insurance premiums on a pre-tax basis rather than an after-tax-basis.
        </p>
        <p>The Premium Only Plan reduces your taxable payroll by reducing your employees' taxable
        income. So both you and your employees pay less in taxes. </p>
        <p><i>One of the best tax savings allowed by the IRS</i> </p>
        <p>IRS-sanctioned Premium Only Plans were created by the Revenue Act of 1978 and are
        governed by Internal Revenue Code Section 125. <ul>
          <li>Employees don't pay FICA, federal or, where applicable, state or local taxes on money
            used to pay for their portion of employer-sponsored insurance premiums. </li>
          <li>Employees' tax savings help to defray the cost of insurance premiums. </li>
          <li>Employees can increase their take-home pay. </li>
          <li>The Premium Only Plan reduces your taxable payroll by the total amount of employer
            contributions for benefits. Low taxable payroll means lower payroll taxes. </li>
          <li>You can allow employees to realize an increase in pay and take credit for a terrific new
            benefit, while still saving money. </li>
          <li>You can increase your employees' share of insurance premiums without negatively
            affecting their take-home pay. </li>
          <li>If you are not requiring employees to contribute to the cost of their insurance, this
            Section 125 Premium Only Plan allows you to do so with the lease impact on employees
            salaries. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The suggested retail price: $630 Per Kit, special price through Greater Kansas City
        Chamber: $430 Per Kit. </p>
