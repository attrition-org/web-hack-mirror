<br>We've been labeled as "Cracker's", "Script Kiddie's"
<br>and a few other things I won't go into here.
<p>It's just amazing how people feel a need to put a label
<br>on things they don't understand!
<p>I'm not going to give you a long speech on language usage
<br>or evolution, but here is a couple of short definitions to the above
terms,
<br>as I <b><font size=+1>"interpret"</font></b> them.
<p><b><font size=+1>Cracker</font></b>:
<br>Someone who gains entry to a server by brute force
<br>cracking passwords.
<br>[How This Does Not Apply To Us]
<br>We have never gained access to a server via a cracked password.
<p><font size=+1>Script Kiddie</font>:
<br>Someone who gains entry to a server via a
<br>pre-made shell scripts or programs.
<br>Also someone who uses known exploits to gain entry.
<br>[How This Does Not Apply To Us]
<br>We have never used pre-made scripts to gain access.
<br>With the exception of two sites, we have never gained access via
<br>known exploits.
<p><b><font size=+1>Our Intent</font></b>:
<br>Our intention has always been to educate.
<br>Too many people think that security on the
<br>internet is a given. Be it security of your
<br>web page, server, personal information,
<br>or credit card data.
<br>You may not agree with the vehicle of
<br>our message, but the informed have to agree
<br>Security on the net is currently just a myth.
