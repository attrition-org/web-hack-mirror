These sites were found to contain explicit images and movies of child and<br>
teenage sexual exploitation through forcible and abusive sexual interaction<br>
by adults. <br>
Although we are not normally defacers nor will we begin defacing regularly<br>
we felt that this was necessary to get the attente of some people we know<br>
are usually too busy to investigate anonymous tips with little proof.<br>
Zdraste, Interpol...<br>
We believe these sites are operated by a child porn ring associated with<br>
the recently uncovered Russian ring busted by the Interpol.<br>
However, after keeping a watch on this issue we believe this sect of deviants<br>
was overlooked. If Interpol determines after investigation that our information<br>
was incorrect, we concede. However, the material present on these machines<br>
is still in violation of international and national laws and must be accounted<br>
for. <br>
<br>
Violaters will not be tolerated. <br>
Below is list of frequent IP ADDR who visit site.<br>
Unfortunately we do no longer have this dates associated with IP ADDR.<br>

Kalyegu was right.. Russia has best hackers..<br>

Interpol, we will contact you with more.<br>

For now, prashaytye.<br>
