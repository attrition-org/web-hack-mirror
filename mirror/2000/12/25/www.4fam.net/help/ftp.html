<p align="center"><font size="5"><u><i>Uploading Your Website</i></u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Your website can be accessed at: http://www.4fam.net/~&lt;username&gt;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">For example if my user name is jason, my site is 
  located at:</font><br>
  <font color="#3333FF"><u>http://www.4fam.net/~jason</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The actual html files must loaded in www.4fam.net/~jason/public_html 
  as you will see in a moment.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Uploading your web site to MICS servers is a very 
  easy process that may seem intimidating.&nbsp; No need to worry, after you have 
  read this page and followed he instructions you will be ftping with the best 
  of them.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The first thing you need is a good ftp client.&nbsp; 
  This is a software application that allows you to transfer files from your local 
  machine to our servers.&nbsp; We recommend WS_FTP.&nbsp; This easy to use application 
  is hard to beat.&nbsp; You can get it at <a href="http://www.tucows.com">http://www.tucows.com</a> 
  or on our cdrom.&nbsp; It is free for personal use.&nbsp; After installing follow 
  these directions step by step.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">When you open WS_FTP it will prompt you for some 
  connection information.&nbsp; Make sure you already have an open connection 
  to the internet.&nbsp; It will look like this..</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="ftp.ht1.gif" width="401" height="313"></font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">For the profile name put in 'MICS'.&nbsp; Host 
  name should be 'ftp.mics.net'.&nbsp; Leave host type at auto detect.&nbsp; Lastly 
  put your username and password in and you&nbsp; are ready to go.&nbsp; &quot;Hit 
  OK&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Once you are connected to our server the screen 
  will look like this......</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="ftp.ht2.gif" width="853" height="440"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">On the left side you have your local machine and 
  on the right side you have our server.&nbsp; At this point you need to double 
  click on the public_html folder in the right pane.&nbsp; This is where you want 
  to put your web files.&nbsp; You can select multiple files by clicking one time 
  on the top file in your selection....hold down your &quot;shift key and clicking 
  on the last file you want to select.&nbsp; This will select all files in between, 
  and will look like this.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="ftp.ht3.gif" width="853" height="440"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">You can now proceed to click the arrow pointing 
  over to the remote location.&nbsp; Wha-La! it will start transferring files.&nbsp; 
  If you have chosen a directory to transfer it will ask if you want to transfer 
  the directory structure...say yes.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Now when you point your browser to your website 
  or location you will see the new files.&nbsp; Also when you update files on 
  your locale machine you can just FTP them up and the changes will show up.&nbsp; 
  Be advised that ftp replaces the file when you transfer....also you can pull 
  your site down to your local machine and it will stay on ours as well.</font></p>
