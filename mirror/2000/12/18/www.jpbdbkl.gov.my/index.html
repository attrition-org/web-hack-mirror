Released From Fla. Jail </u></strong><br>
<br>
By PAT LEISNER, Associated Press Writer <br>
<br>
BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) - A Palestinian was released from jail and
walked into the arms of his weeping family Friday, after being
locked up for three years on secret government evidence without
being charged with a crime.<br>
<br>
``It's a great day for justice and a sad day for arrogance and
oppression,'' Mazen Al-Najjar told a crowd outside the Manatee
County Detention Center.<br>
<br>
Attorney General Janet Reno had earlier lifted an order that had
kept Al-Najjar behind bars. In a statement, Reno said that
Justice Department (news - web sites) officials ``anticipate he
could be deported from the United States soon.''<br>
<br>
The government has maintained that Al-Najjar had links to Mideast
terrorists and was a threat to national security. A 43-year-old
academic who has lived in the United States since 1981, Al-Najjar
denied the allegations. Not even his lawyers have seen the
evidence against him.<br>
<br>
When he was released, Al-Najjar's wife, Fedaa, grabbed him around
the neck, hugging and kissing him in a long embrace. He then
picked up and hugged his three young daughters. Tears rolled down
the face of his sister, Nahla Al-Arian.<br>
<br>
``I hope this is the end of the nightmare,'' Al-Najjar said.<br>
<br>
Al-Najjar was among about three immigrants believed held this
week in U.S. jails without criminal charges on classified
evidence. The government does not release the names of such
prisoners. But more than two years ago, immigrant advocate
groups, using the Freedom of Information Act, found government
documents showing that 23 aliens, mostly Arabs, were held on
secret evidence.<br>
<br>
``Since then, all but two of the cases we know about have been
released,'' said Kit Gage, director of the National Coalition to
Protect Political Freedom.</font><br>
