  Yes Mr. Admin Your Systems Security Was Compromised By A &quot;Hacker&quot;. 
  This Was Only Done Because Of The Media Always Looking At Us Like We Are Bad. 
  We Are Not Bad!! We Are As Needed As The Air You Breate You See Without Failure 
  You Can Not Understand Success. And Secondly We Are Not Here To Make Your Life 
  Hell By Fucking Up Your Web Site We Are Here To Let You Know You Need A Little 
  More Work And We Would Appriate It If You Gave Us A Little More Credit. Your 
  Old Html Is <a href="olddefault.htm">Here</a> and You Can Go Get The Patch So 
  Other Hackers Wont Do This To You Again <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/critical/q269862/default.asp">Here</a> 
  Thank You.
