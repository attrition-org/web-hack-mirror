Palestinians killed on Sunday's confrontations with the Israelis<br>
</b></font><font face="Verdana"><i>Palestine, Politics,
12/18/2000</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Verdana">Confrontation have been
escalated on Sunday in various areas of the West bank and Gaza
despite of the news which talked about Palestinian, Israeli and
US consultations on resuming the negotiations. These news coupled
with the escalation of the Israeli terrorism against the
Palestinians.<br>
<br>
The Palestinians Eyad Mahmoud Dawoud ( 27) and Ahmad Abdul Jalil
Qassas ( 33) were killed by the Israeli fire bullets in the
confrontations which took place in Rafah city, near Salah eddine
gate on the Palestinian borders. As a result five Palestinian
were hit, one of them was seriously wounded and they were
admitted to the hospital.<br>
<br>
Eye- witnesses said the Israeli occupation solders were opening
fire randomly against the Palestinian citizens and that a special
unit from the Israeli forces assassinated the activist at &quot;
the Fatah&quot; movement Samih al-Murabi at Qalindya camp.
Al-Murabi is 27 year old. The Palestinian Muhammad Shalash ( 18)
was killed by the guns of the Israeli settlers near Ramullah.<br>
<br>
Meantime, Palestinian demonstrations broke into several
Palestinian areas and then the Palestinian youths started to
strike Israeli positions by stones in Khan Younis, at the
crossroad to Ghoushe Kteive settlement, in Hebron ( al-Khalil)
and near the settlements and they damaged an Israeli military
vehicle and two coaches carrying armed settlers near Ghoushe
Kteive. They also attacked Jewish settlements in Jerusalem, and
Gaza and wounded a settler near Jenin.<br>
<br>
Meantime, Palestinians detonated an explosive near Eibal mountain
when Israeli military vehicles passed by and attacked an Israeli
on- foot patrol near Ramullah.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the Israeli forces continued their bombardment of the
Palestinian cities and villages and missiles on Sunday were
dropped on positions in al-Khalil ( Hebron), and Raheel dome and
also in Bethlehem and Gaza and the Israeli forces carried out a
vast detention campaign in various parts of the west bank and
Gaza.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, news reports said that the Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat announced that a Palestinian delegations
and another Israeli one will head for Washington within the few
coming days to make consultations with the American
administration on resuming the negotiations.<br>
<br>
To this effect, the Israeli foreign minister Shloumo Bin Ami
talked about a possible settlement with the Palestinians over
al-Aqsa mosque.<br>
<br>
He explained there should be a definite solution for the question
of al- Aqsa mosque. He continued that the Palestinians and the
Israelis will discuss in Washington the two issues of halting the
Intifada and means of pushing forward bilateral talks.<br>
<br>
Bin Ami added that what has been so far discussed between the two
sides were Camp David ideas, and the red lines that israel still
persistent on. He ruled out any Israeli concessions in the issue
of having sovereignty over Jerusalem.</font></p>
