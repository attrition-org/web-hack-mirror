    You loved your site, the files could have been together. Think about it. <BR>
    We replaced them now, We hope you can't sleep and you dream about it. <BR>
    And when you dream, We hope you can't sleep and you scream about it. <BR>
    We hope your conscious eats at you and you can't breathe without me.<BR>
    See Admin, Cause if he suffocates, he'll suffer more, and then he'll die too. 
    <BR>
    Well, gotta go, We are almost at the deep end now. <BR>
    Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to erase this shit out? <BR>
    <BR>
    <BR>
    Oh, what's a matter Admin? Are We too smart for you?? <BR>
    Too bad bitch, your gonna finally hear someone out this time <BR>
    At first, We are like all right, you wanna throw us out, that's fine. <BR>
    But not for you to take my place, are you out you're mind? <BR>
    This computer, this server, this whole thing is now mine. <BR>
    How could you let him operate with no decent security? <BR>
    <BR>
    Why are we doing this? <BR>
    <BR>
    You're never going to get away at this.. <BR>
    You think we give a fuck! </p>
  <p>Keep In Mind One Thing:</p>
  <p>We 0wn You</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>The Revolution is Coming.....</p>
