Student participation is always viewed instrumental in the successful 
operations  of the lab. We have a volunteer program that allows students to 
participate on  a volunteer basis all lab activities including system 
administration. Students  with enthusiasm to learn are given access to the 
resources available based on  their levels of participation. It may range from 
helping out in a single event to full system administration responsibilities.
Their contributions have made it possible for the lab to provide computing
services to the users in a scale that normally requires full-time employees.
We credit our success largely to all the student volunteers who have 
participated in  the establishment, daily as well  as special activities of
the lab. Their hardworking have made the lab an important and pleasant resource
of learning for students.
