Thanks to a generous donation from <a HREF="http://www.motorola.com">
Motorola</a>, and with matching funds from the 
<a HREF="http://www.eng.fau.edu">College of 
Engineering</a>, the Telecommunications and Computer Networking Laboratory 
(TCN) was established in the <a HREF="http://www.cse.fau.edu/">Computer 
Science and Engineering (CSE) Department</a> in 1996. It is a 
state-of-the-art, multimedia-grade computing laboratory. All the computers 
are pentium-based equipped with audio and video facilities, and are all 
connected to the Internet. The systems run in an NT environment with one 
local NT server and 10+ Windows/NT clients.

<!--<p>In recognition of the increasing importance of the computer communications field, it is a high priority of the Department of Computer Science andEngineering (CSE) to provide its students good fundations in the field.We deeply believe that an adequately equipped communication laboratory iscrucial in the aim to impart to our students both theoretical knowledge aswell as practical experience in the constantly changing and evolving technicalfield.<p>Thanks to the generous donation from Motorola with matching funds from theEngineering College, we have established the Telecommunications and ComputerNetworking Laboratory (TCN) in the CSE Department in the beginning of 1996. Itis a state-of-the-art, multimedia-grade computing lab. All computers arepentium-based, equipped with audio and video facilities, and are all connectedto the Internet. It is a NT environment with one local NT server and 10 NT/Windows 95 clients. <p>We believe that well-educated students are assets to our society. We are, onone hand, maximizing the use of the available computing equipment to preparetechnically skilled students for the work environment of today. On the otherhand, we are also doing our best to keep up with the advancement of thetechnology by constantly updating our computing equipment in this lab to preparestudents for meeting the technical needs of tomorrow's world.</div><p><p><br><div align="right"><dfn><font size=+1>Sam Hsu</dfn></font></div></td></tr></table></center>-->
