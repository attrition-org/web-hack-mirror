<P>To:  Post-Testbed Registrars and Pending Applicants
<BR>From:  <A HREF="mailto:mclaughlin@icann.org">Andrew McLaughlin</A>, ICANN
<BR>Date:  14 June, 1999
<BR>Re:  Registrar Competition - Testbed and Accreditation Update #2

<P>This memo is to give you an update on the status of ICANN's Registrar
Accreditation Program and various activities in connection with the testing
of the Shared Registry System (SRS).  As you know, the SRS is being deployed
by NSI as required by its agreement
with the US Government to enable the opening the .com, .net, and .org TLDs
to competition in registration services.  In particular, I want to give some
additional details on the procedures for a registrar's entry into
competition that have become better
defined as the testbed has progressed.  We hope these details will assist
you in your planning, so that you can begin offering
registration services at the earliest possible time.

<P>1.  <U>Status of the testbed</U>.  
<P>As reported at ICANN's Berlin meeting,
significant technical problems were encountered early in the testbed period.
As a result, the first accredited registrar to offer competitive
registration services (register.com) inaugurated its service last week --
six weeks into the two-month testbed period.  Although NSI has declined to
publicly explain the reasons for these delays, it appears that some aspects
of the SRS did not initially work as expected, so that testbed registrars
have experienced great difficulties in connecting to the SRS and
implementing and testing their interfaces to the system.

<P>Even register.com's system does not presently support important aspects
of the SRS (such as transfer of domain name registrations and SLD holder
data between registrars).  We are hopeful, however, that the more basic
technical problems with the SRS system have been resolved so that thorough
testing can proceed promptly.  We expect other testbed registrars to begin
offering registration services within the next two weeks.

<P>It is up to NSI and the US Department of Commerce to decide whether to
extend the testbed period.  As far as ICANN is aware, no decision has yet
been made to extend the testbed.  It should be kept in mind, however, that
the US Government's Statement of Policy (a.k.a., the White Paper) calls for
competition to be introduced in a manner that preserves the operational
stability of the Internet.  At the present time, there are unresolved
technical problems with the SRS that should be solved before introduction of
additional registrars on the system.  While the testbed registrars are
attempting to resolve those issues as promptly as possible, so that they
themselves can offer the full range of registration services, it is possible
that some extension of the testbed may become necessary.

<P>2.  <U>NSI's Registrar Operations During and After the Testbed.</U>

<P>During
the testbed period, NSI is being permitted to continue offering registration
services on a legacy basis.  This allows the new, competitive system for
registrations to be introduced in a stable manner, while providing customers
with access to the long-established mechanisms for registration.  NSI may
not substantially change the nature of its legacy services without approval
from the US Government.  This means that during the testbed period NSI and
the testbed registrars are operating under somewhat different ground rules.
The testbed registrars must operate in conformity with ICANN's
registrar-accreditation policy, which allows each registrar to set its own
pricing competitively, but which establishes various best practices for
registrars including, for example, the requirement for prepayment of
registration fees.  NSI, on the other hand, is instead required to conform
to the conditions of its cooperative agreement with the US Government, which
does not require prepayment, but fixes NSI's prices at $70 for an initial,
two- year registration and $35 for one-year renewals.

<P>     During the testbed period, NSI is adjusting its business and technical
systems to separate its operation of the registry from its registrar
business.  Although earlier this month NSI was not using some aspects of the
SRS in its own registrar business, it appears that NSI has recently been
migrating its systems to employ the SRS.

<P>     After the conclusion of the testbed period, NSI will be required to
operate its registry business on the same terms and conditions as all other
registrars, including accreditation by ICANN.

<P>     3.   <U>Summary of Process for Gaining Access to SRS.</U>
<P>  As the testbed has
proceeded, details in the sequence of procedures for registrars have been
better defined. For your planning purposes, those procedures may be
summarized as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     a.  <I>Apply for accreditation by ICANN</I>.  The addressees of this memo have
all completed this step.

<P>     b.  <I>Receive notification that you qualify for accreditation</I>.  Upon
review and verification of the information in the application and
resolution of any outstanding questions regarding the application, ICANN
will inform the applicant whether its application qualified for
accreditation.  In addition to the five testbed registrars, thirty-seven
applicants have completed this step.  Ordinarily, this occurs within thirty
days of the application.

<P>     c.  <I>Sign an accreditation agreement with ICANN</I>.  Signing the registrar
accreditation agreement is required as the final step in becoming accredited
by ICANN.  The agreements are not yet available for signature by
post-testbed registrars, but will be before the conclusion of the testbed
period.  The agreements will be sent in hard copy by mail and should be
signed and returned promptly upon receipt.

<P>     d.  <I>Sign a confidentiality agreement with NSI</I>.   NSI requires that you
sign a Confidentiality Agreement before you are given access to certain SRS
software and documentation.  See Exhibit C to the Registrar License and
Agreement at [<A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/rla42199.htm">http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/rla42199.htm</A>].

<P>     e.  <I>Obtain a performance bond</I>.  The version of the Registrar License
and Agreement currently approved for use by NSI during the testbed
<http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/rla42199.htm> requires
registrars to have in place a $100,000 performance bond before their license
with NSI to use the SRS becomes effective.  Although the burden on
registrars associated with the requirement for a bond in the post-testbed
period is a matter of concern to ICANN and the bonding requirement remains a
subject of negotiations between NSI and the US Government, it would be
prudent, in order to avoid unnecessary delays, for registrars to assume that
this requirement may remain, and take steps to ensure that a bond will be
promptly available to them.

<P>     f.  <I>Arrange to obtain an appropriate SSL license</I>.  Your system's
communications with the SRS will employ a secure sockets layer interface.
Testbed registrars have experienced compatability problems with certain SSL
toolkits.  These compatibility issues are still being investigated; we hope
an accurate list of compatible toolkits will be available soon.  Also under
discussion is whether certificates generated by third-party Certificate
Authorities will be required.

<P>     g.  <I>Prepare to sign a post-testbed Registrar License and Agreement with
NSI.</I>  To date, only the terms of the NSI-Registrar License and Agreement for
use in the testbed period have been agreed by NSI and the US Government.
The terms of the post-testbed NSI-Registrar agreement remain to be
negotiated by the U.S. Department of Commerce and NSI, and must be approved
by the Department of Commerce.  (Any comments you have on matters that
should be negotiated should be sent to ICANN at  [<A HREF="mailto:mclaughlin@icann.org">mclaughlin@icann.org</A>] and
[<A HREF="mailto:lltouton@jonesday.com">lltouton@jonesday.com</A>] 
and will be passed on to the negotiators at the US
Department of Commerce.)

<P>     h.  <I>Prepare to pay NSI's License Fee</I>.  NSI's SRS software license fee
is currently a $10,000 one-time fee, but also remains subject to NSI's
negotiation with and approval by the US Department of Commerce.  Before you
are allowed to connect with the SRS system, you will be required to pay this
fee to NSI.

<P>     i.  <I>Obtain the SRS software and documentation from NSI.</I>  According to
the ordinary procedures, you will receive the SRS software (including the
APIs, a reference implementation for Java, and documentation) from NSI after
you have:  (1) signed the post-testbed Registrar License and Agreement, (2)
signed the Confidentiality Agreement, and (3) paid the NSI license fee.  To
allow post-testbed registrars to obtain early access to the software and
documentation so that they can begin working during the testbed period to
prepare their systems, the US Department of Commerce has made special
arrangements with NSI so that, beginning June 15, you can obtain the SRS
software and documentation from NSI by:  (1) signing the **testbed**
Registrar License and Agreement (review section 6.1(a) and (d) of the
agreement as to the effect of this); (2) signing a confidentiality
agreement; and (3) paying the license fee.  While these steps are not
themselves sufficient to permit you to connect with the SRS, they will give
you a head start in preparing to do so.

<P>     j.  <I>Prepare your systems to interface with the system.</I>  The C and Java
languages are supported by the APIs.  In addition to the direct registration
functions to be implemented through the SRS, your system must also provide
Whois (or similar) service for the names you will register for customers and
must support the ICANN data escrow program.

<P>     k.  <I>Test your software.</I>  NSI has established a test platform for your
use in testing your system's interoperability with the SRS.  You will be
given a userid and password for this system.

<P>     l.  <I>Verification of your system's functionality.</I>  NSI will verify that
your system properly interfaces to the SRS.

<P>     m.  <I>Make arrangements with NSI for payment of registration fees.</I>  NSI
will require that before you may actually register domain names through the
SRS, you must make arrangements to pay the registry fees through a letter of
credit, deposit account, or other credit terms acceptable to NSI.

<P>     n.  <I>Complete preparation of your agreement with customers and your
domain-name dispute policy.</I>  The ICANN accreditation agreement provides some
guidance on these requirements.  At present, ICANN has endorsed the
principle that registrars in the .com, .net, and .org TLDs should have a
uniform dispute resolution policy, but the details of the policy to be
adopted by ICANN are under consideration and will not be finalized until at
least August.  In the meantime, each registrar is required to adopt its own
policy for use in its registration operations unitl the ICANN policy is
finalized.  The testbed registrars have been working together on a voluntary
basis to formulate a common interim dispute resolution policy.  You should
soon receive a copy of a draft of that policy from register.com, which is
coordinating the drafting effort, offering you an opportunity to comment.

<P>     o.  <I>Inaugurate your service.</I>  After the above steps have been
completed, you should be in a position to begin offering services to the
public.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>     4.  <U>Current Whois Situation</U>

<P>  The introduction of the SRS has resulted in the reformulation of Whois
service for the .com, .net, and .org TLDs.  Partly because these changes
have not been understood by the Internet user community, significant
confusion has resulted.  This confusion has been compounded by technical
issues involving the sequence of transition to the SRS.  In brief terms, NSI
is providing a registry-level Whois service (web interface available at
www.nsiregistry.com) that basically gives the domain name, the sponsoring
registrar, and the nameservers for all SLDs registered in the .com, .net,
and .org TLDs.  Under NSI's technical plan, each registrar is to provide
registrar-level Whois service giving additional details (e.g., SLD holder's
name and technical contacts) **as to the names it sponsors only**.  (NSI's
registrar-level Whois service is currently located at internic.net and
netsol.com.)  While ICANN does not believe that this is a satisfactory
long-term solution, it is the situation that NSI has imposed for the short
term.  ICANN plans to provide more detailed information in a later memo.  In
the meantime, those of you providing Whois service in your reseller
operations may wish to adjust the service to minimize public confusion.

<P>     5.  <U>DNSO Registrar Constituency</U>

<P>     As mentioned in my May 13 memo, one important way for registrars to
have input into decisions affecting their interests is the Registrar
Constituency group of ICANN's <A HREF="http://www.dnso.org">Domain Name 
Supporting Organization</A> (DNSO).
That constituency was provisionally recognized by the ICANN Board of
Directors at its recent Berlin meeting, and is attempting to give voice to
the concerns of current and prospective competitive registrars.  For more
information, contact the registrar consitiuency group's acting secretatiat,
Michael D. Palage of InfoNetworks at <A HREF="mailto:mpalage@ipwarehouse.com">mpalage@ipwarehouse.com</A>.

<P>     6.  <U>ICANN Registrar Web Pages</U>

<P>     ICANN has posted a revised set of registrar and accreditation web pages
at [<A HREF="http://www.icann.org/registrars/accreditation.html">http://www.icann.org/registrars/accreditation.html</A>].  
Since you have all
navigated the process of applying for registrar accreditation--and because
many of you are, or employ, experienced web designers--we encourage you to
look at those pages and pass on any suggestions you might have for
improvement.  In addition, you should be sure to check your company's entry
on the listing of post-testbed registrars at
[<A HREF="accreditation-qualified-list.html">http://www.icann.org/registrars/accreditation-qualified-list.html</A>] to
ensure that the description, link, and contact information are up-to-date.

<P>     7.  Feedback

     Comments on ICANN accreditation should be addressed to Andrew
McLaughlin at [<A HREF="mailto:mclaughlin@icann.org">mclaughlin@icann.org</A>] and
