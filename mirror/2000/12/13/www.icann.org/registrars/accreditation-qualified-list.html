The American Domain Name Registry seeks to contribute to the growth

For example, during the initial phase of its development, the
American Registry will attempt to develop an easier and more user-friendly
approach for searching and registering domain names. But the hallmark
of the American Registry will be its turnkey e-commerce package
(e.g. Internet storefront) and technical support that will be
offered to its registrants&#151; during the second phase. Registrants
will be able to open Internet storefronts without programming
knowledge. This is the type of innovation and public service that
the American Registry will strive to achieve. To implement these
plans, the American Registry plans to raise working capital by
listing itself on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ in the
near future.</FONT></P>
