      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">FRIDAY, 14 JULY 2000 - The Governmental
      Advisory Committee of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
      and Numbers held its sixth meeting yesterday and today in Yokohama.
      The attending Committee members, representing 31 national governments,
      distinct economies as recognised in international fora, and multinational
      governmental and treaty organisations, reflecting representation
      from all of ICANN&#146;s geographic regions, issued the following
      statement:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC)
      has had fruitful discussions around substantive issues relating
      to the usage of the Internet across the worldwide community,
      ICANN activities, and the administration of the country code
      top level domains:</FONT></P>

      <P><A NAME="A"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">A. With regard to ICANN&#146;s
      funding and budget:</FONT></B></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The governments, public authorities and
        organisations that comprise the GAC support ICANN; it is recognised
        that ensuring that ICANN has a sufficient level of funding is
        a crucial component of enabling it to complete the tasks for
        which it was created. Accordingly, it is important that ICANN
        receive a level of funding which will allow it to fulfil its
        responsibilities, including consensus development and ensuring
        the reliable technical operation of the domain name system.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is noted that through its document &quot;Principles
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level
        Domains&quot; (the GAC Principles), the GAC has indicated its
        view that ccTLD administrators should contribute towards the
        funding of ICANN in accordance with an equitable scale, based
        on ICANN&#146;s total funding requirements (including reserves),
        developed by ICANN on the basis of consensus.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">With regard to the contribution for the
        past fiscal year, the view of the GAC is that ccTLDs should pay
        the prescribed contribution contained in ICANN&#146;s 1999-2000
        Budget.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Recognising that situations may differ
        among various ccTLDs, the GAC encourages ccTLDs to explore means
        appropriate to their particular circumstances to ensure payment
        of their contribution to ICANN within a reasonable time frame.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">With respect to the future allocation of
        ICANN&#146;s cost recovery obligations, the GAC recommends that
        ICANN develop and broadly communicate procedures to ensure that
        consensus exists with respect to funding allocations. Those procedures
        should spell out the obligation of all parties to participate
        in opportunities such as notice and comment periods designed
        to determine whether or not consensus is present.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As decisions within ICANN are based on
        consensus, the GAC encourages ICANN&#146;s Task Force on Funding,
        the ccTLD community and others to continue their efforts to achieve
        consensus on the determination of:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">1. the future appropriate share of ICANN&#146;s
          budget contributed to by all relevant participants; and</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">2. the appropriate criteria and mechanism
          for calculating the amount of each ccTLD&#146;s annual contribution
          to the funding of ICANN.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The GAC encourages ICANN to present the
        results of this work in time for its next round of meetings in
        November 2000.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><A NAME="B"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">B. With regard to the
      addition of new top level domains (TLDs):</FONT></B></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">That this is a very important area and
        the GAC wishes to consider it further.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><A NAME="C"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">C. With regard to the
      delegation and administration of country code top level domains
      (ccTLDs):</FONT></B></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The GAC has had constructive discussions
        with the ccTLD Constituency of the DNSO. It is noted that there
        are many areas of common ground between the GAC and the ccTLD
        Constituency, however there are also a number of areas where
        further discussion should be undertaken.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The GAC reconfirmed its support for the
        GAC Document &quot;Principles for the Delegation and Administration
        of Country Code Top Level Domains&quot;. The GAC noted in particular
        that while governments and public authorities need not be involved
        in day to day decision making, they exercise ultimate public
        policy authority, representing the interests of the people for
        which the ccTLD has been delegated.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In order to minimise prejudice (potential
        or otherwise) ICANN should not enter into any contractual arrangements
        with ccTLD administrators of ccTLDs for which redelegation requests
        are pending.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The GAC invites ICANN, as a first step,
        to write to the relevant governments and public authorities to
        ascertain their views concerning the current delegation for the
        ccTLDs that correspond to their jurisdictions.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The GAC advises ICANN not to enter into
        contracts with any ccTLD registries until they have received
        the relevant communication, as referred to above, from the relevant
        government or public authority.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thereafter, the GAC encourages that any
        future contracts between ICANN and ccTLD administrators should
        reflect the administrators&#146; commitment to be bound by the
        GAC Principles (as they are implemented by the relevant government
        or public authority) and minimize the liability of ICANN for
        implementing a redelegation according to these principles.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">With reference to the draft ccTLD Manager
        / ICANN Status Quo Agreement, the GAC:</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">notes that unfortunately, given the short
          time period for comments in preparation for Yokohama, the GAC
          has not had sufficient time to consider and comment on this matter;</FONT>
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">notes that this is a discussion document
          from the ICANN staff and that ICANN will not act on this before
          full consultation; and</FONT>
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">considers that the issues in this document
          need thorough discussion to take full account of the view of
          governments and public authorities and they will be examined
          by the GAC for consistency with the GAC Principles document,
          and notably the communication-based regime proposed by the GAC</FONT>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN should make reference to existing
        international norms for regional distribution of countries.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The GAC thanks the Japanese government,
      the Yokohama Host Committee, the Japan Network Information Centre
      (JPNIC) and the sponsors for hosting its meeting.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The next face-to-face meeting of the GAC
      will be held in November 2000 in Marina Del Rey to coincide with
      ICANN&#146;s next round of meetings.</FONT></P>
