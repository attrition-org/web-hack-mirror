<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The ICANN Bylaws (Article VII, Section 3(b))
describe the Governmental Advisory Committee as follows:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">There shall be a Governmental Advisory
    Committee. The initial chairman of the Governmental Advisory
    Committee shall be appointed by the Board and shall hold that
    position until the election of his or her successor; subsequent
    chairs shall be elected by the members of the Governmental Advisory
    Committee pursuant to procedures adopted by such members. Membership
    of the Governmental Advisory Committee shall be open to all national
    governments. Membership shall also be open to Distinct Economies
    as recognized in international fora, and multinational governmental
    organizations and treaty organizations, on the invitation of
    the Governmental Advisory Committee through its Chair, or on
    invitation of the ICANN Board. Members of the Governmental Advisory
    Committee shall appoint one accredited representative to the
    Committee. The accredited representative of a member must hold
    a formal official position with the member's public administration.
    The term &quot;official&quot; includes a holder of an elected
    governmental office, or a person who is employed by such government,
    public authority or multinational governmental or treaty organization
    and whose primary function with such government, public authority
    or organization is to develop or influence governmental or public
    policies. The Governmental Advisory Committee should consider
    and provide advice on the activities of the Corporation as they
    relate to concerns of governments, particularly matters where
    there may be an interaction between the Corporation's policies
    and various laws, and international agreements. The Board will
    notify the chairman of the Governmental Advisory Committee of
    any proposal for which it seeks comments under Article III, Section
    3(b) and will consider any response to that notification prior
    to taking action.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
