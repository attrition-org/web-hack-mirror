      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">This staff working paper is being published
      for public comment with the intention that it contribute to accomplishment
      of three objectives:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(1) Provide an updated cost recovery structure
        for Top Level Domain Name Registries that can be used in completing
        agreements with the organizations selected to operate the new
        registries.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(2) Provide a basis for discussion with
        the country code top level domain registry community leading
        to completion of registry agreements with those organizations.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(3) Provide a means to simplify and harmonize
        the existing revenue structure, which was adopted in 1999, particularly
        with reference to DNS scaling and registry business model issues.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Comment is welcome on all aspects of this
      paper, but in particular, comments and possibly alternative approaches
      and formulations are sought on the following points:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">application of a common structure to all
        top level domain name registries/registrars that are comparably
        situated in the DNS, as measured by their business model, volume
        and level of service, etc.<BR>
        </FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">the appropriate division of the annual
        fee structure between a fixed and a variable component, as discussed
        in <A HREF="#C">sections C</A>, <A HREF="#D">D</A>, and <A HREF="#E">E</A>.<BR>
        </FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">the granularity and levels of fixed annual
        fees presented in <A HREF="#E.1">sections E.1</A> and <A HREF="#E.4">E.4</A>.<BR>
        </FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">the continued and expanded use of the
        proportionate registry size formula for calculating the variable
        annual fee that is contained in section <A HREF="#E.3">E.3</A>.</FONT>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In addition to public comment, ICANN is
      obligated under current Board policy to consult directly with
      representatives of the Domain Name and IP address registries
      in matters affecting the budget, and will do so with respect
      to the recommendations and proposals in this staff paper.</FONT></P>

      <H3><A NAME="B"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">B. <U>Background</U></FONT></H3>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The present budget structure for ICANN
      was adopted by the Board in November, 1999, following completion
      of the work of the Task Force on Funding (TFF). The complete
      TFF report may be accessed at: &lt;<A HREF="../tff/tff.htm">http://www.icann.org/tff/tff.htm</A>&gt;</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The ICANN Board, in directing the creation
        of the TFF, charged it with &quot;formulating recommendations
        on cost-recovery mechanisms that fairly apportion ICANN's funding
        needs, as reflected in the budget that has been adopted, among
        the Internet name and address registry administrators and registrars
        and possibly other parties...&quot;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The subsequent report contained a number
      of recommendations, of which the one most pertinent to the topic
      of cost recovery structure is:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;The TFF recommends that for the foreseeable
        future the basic funding needs of ICANN be supported by IP address
        registries and domain name registries and registrars. As articulated
        in the White Paper, ICANN constituents benefiting from ICANN's
        technical coordination and policy development activities should
        contribute to its budget, whether individually or through intermediary
        fee aggregating organizations.&quot;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Following the above points, the goals of
      the revenue structure may be stated as,</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">to produce the funding necessary to support
        ICANN's mission and programs,<BR>
        </FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">to allocate fairly the responsibility
        for providing that funding, <BR>
        </FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">to develop a cost recovery, i.e. revenue,
        structure that is understandable and that can be administered
        without excessive costs</FONT>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The revenue structure developed in support
      of these goals and recommended in the TFF report has been only
      partially implemented as a result of delays in executing agreements
      with country code Domain Name Registry organizations. With respect
      to the ccTLD agreements, part of the delay is related to disagreement
      on an appropriate structure for contributions to support ICANN's
      funding requirements. (An explanation of the details of the current
      structure appears in <A HREF="#fn1">Note 1</A> below.)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">This staff working paper does not deal
      with the issue of the appropriate balance between revenue contributions
      from Domain Name registries and from IP Address registries, which
      currently stands at 90%-10% based on last year's Task Force on
      Funding (TFF) recommendation. All of the sections below assume
      10% of the total annual budgeted revenue requirement continues
      to be met by the Address registries.</FONT></P>

      <H3><A NAME="C"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">C. <U>Revisions to the
      Domain Name Registry/Registrar Revenue Structure</U></FONT></H3>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">After reviewing the pertinent background
      material and the operating experience of the past year, the staff
      believes the following general precepts ought to be applied to
      the development of an updated domain name registry/registrar
      revenue structure.</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(1) <U>Scope of Application</U>. In the
        interests of consistency and harmonization, the new structure
        should apply uniformly to all registries and registrars. In effect,
        ICANN should shift from its current practice of treating registries
        in terms of who or what they are, to a new policy in which the
        basic financial relationship is modulated by the business model
        of the registry. See <A HREF="#E">section E</A> below for more
        elaboration on this point.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(2) <U>Registry &amp; Registrar Relationships</U>.
        In general, the revenue arrangements should be executed with
        and administered by the registry operator. This appears to be
        the most flexible and administratively efficient approach. For
        the time being, ICANN should continue to deal separately with
        registries and registrars, where that is the locally preferred
        or required arrangement, with the intention of working toward
        a registry centered relationship.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(3) <U>Fixed and Variable Components</U>.
        The structure should continue to have both a fixed and a variable
        component to reflect the diversity of economic circumstances
        prevailing among the domain name registries worldwide. Commercial
        registry operators, who provide more than 80% of ICANN's domain
        name registry revenue under the existing structure, have recommended
        that the variable component of the revenue structure should provide
        a substantial proportion of the total needed revenue, since this
        is believed to most equitably apportion the funding burden.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(4) <U>Use of Proportional Registry Size</U>.
        The algorithm for determining the variable part of the individual
        organizational shares in the domain name revenue component of
        the ICANN budget should continue to be based on proportional
        registry size as measured by number of domain names registered.
        The present procedure, adopted by the Board in November, 1999,
        at the recommendation of the Task Force on Funding, calculates
        the proportional shares once each quarter based on registry data.
        Although there has been some debate about using other measures,
        such as gross revenues or net profits of registry companies,
        or economic measures associated with countries in which registries
        are located, or self-identification of amounts to be treated
        as voluntary donations toward revenue needs, none of them meets
        the tests of being administratively feasible and of meeting an
        overall fairness criterion.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(5) <U>Simplify Calculation</U>. The TFF
        recommended revenue structure has a two tier, two step process
        in which the approved expense level to be recovered from Name
        and Address Registries and Registrars is first divided into &quot;macro&quot;
        shares and then subsequently recovered through a second formula
        within each of the three macro contributors - Address Registries,
        gTLD registries/registrars, and ccTLD registries/registrars.
        During its deliberations, the TFF members agreed that a fair
        apportionment of the macro shares, based on conditions prevailing
        in the summer and fall of 1999, was 10% - 55% - 35% for the Address
        community, gTLD community, and ccTLD community respectively.
        Subsequently, these macro divisions have been challenged on the
        grounds that they lack substantive rationale and hence are only
        the subjective opinions of a small and not necessarily representative
        committee of registry and registrar executives. The staff believes
        that the recommendations of the TFF were sound under the circumstances
        of the task force work, but that improvements are desirable.
        To that end, this staff paper proposes that all of the domain
        name portion of the revenue calculation be based on the fixed
        and variable structure proposed in section D below. As noted
        above, there are issues related to the division of ICANN's budget
        support between Address Registries and Name Registries that are
        not dealt with in this paper.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(6) <U>Provide for Special Registry Circumstances</U>.
        At the same time that some simplifying assumptions are adopted
        as proposed above, a number of exception or waiver conditions
        should be considered by the Board in order to allow the staff
        to deal with financial hardship and other special situations
        where needed.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H3><A NAME="D"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">D. <U>Revenue Versus Expense
      Considerations</U></FONT></H3>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">One of the agreements reached in the TFF
      process a year ago, and subsequently adopted by the Board, was
      that the budget should be driven from the expense side, not the
      revenue side. This principle essentially commits the Board, with
      respect to potential new revenue from the new TLDs, to using
      any revenue capacity in excess of reasonably projected incremental
      operating costs to rebalance and achieve improved consistency
      of revenue shares among all the domain name registries and registrars.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">With respect to the costs to be recovered
      in the domain name portion of the revenue structure, the amount
      budgeted for the current fiscal year is $4.386 million. This
      does not reflect revisions that will be necessary to accommodate
      increased expenses in ICANN's budget for management and administrative
      costs of the new TLDs.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Although the Board has not yet had an opportunity
      to review staff proposals on a midyear budget revision to cover
      such costs, an increase in expenses of $614,000 has been assumed
      for the purposes of this working paper, resulting in a total
      domain name expense amount to be recovered of $5.000 million.
      This figure is used in the projections in the following section.
      Please note that in the actual application of the revised structure
      to the current fiscal year, there would be adjustments for less
      than twelve month's applicability.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(There are other currently unbudgeted new
      expenses to be considered in the mid-year financial review in
      January, such as the At Large membership program, and the root
      server system improvement program. Provision for recovery of
      these costs is not included in the calculations in this staff
      paper.)</FONT></P>

      <H3><A NAME="E"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">E. <U>Revised Revenue
      Structure</U></FONT></H3>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As noted above, the proposed revisions
      to the ICANN revenue structure are based on the type of business
      model being employed by the registry. This section of the staff
      paper presents a proposed business model registry classification
      scheme, followed by sample calculations of fixed and variable
      components of the fees to be assessed. The current evolution
      of business models for domain name registries is rapid. The classifications
      proposed here will benefit from public comment, and from alternative
      formulations by registries themselves, if offered.</FONT></P>

      <P><A NAME="E.1"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">E.1 Registry Business
      Model Classifications</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In order to calculate the fixed component
      of the annual fee, a classification of registries is proposed,
      based on the business model under which the registry is operating.
      ( N.B. Example TLD names used in this section that do not currently
      exist are only illustrative of applications received by ICANN.)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The proposed classes are:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Class 1 - Commercial. (Either the registry,
      or the registrar, or both, are operated as for-profit entities.)
      Registrant categories are as follows.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">1a - Worldwide availability, unrestricted
      as to registrants. E.g., .com, .nu, .tv, .cc</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">1b - Worldwide availability, restricted
      as to registrants. E.g., possible new TLDs such as .air.<BR>
<BR>
      1c - Restricted to country or territorial presence of registrant,
      E.g., .au, .ca</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Class 2 - Noncommercial. (Both the registry
      and the registration activities are operated on a non-profit
      or not-for-profit, cost recovery basis.)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">2a - Worldwide availability, unrestricted
      as to registrants. E.g., possible new TLDs such as .health</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">2b - Worldwide availability, restricted
      as to registrants. E.g., .int, .union</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">2c - Restricted to country or territorial
      presence of registrant.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Class 3 - Special Purpose. For registries
      with no cost recovery structure, or qualifying under other criteria
      such as demonstrated financial hardship. Currently is set at
      $500 per year.</FONT></P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><A NAME="E.2"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">E.2 Allocation Between
      Fixed and Variable Component</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">During the negotiations leading to registry/registrar
      agreements for .com/net/org in 1999, a formula containing both
      fixed and variable components was selected. In the current fiscal
      year, $3.636 million ($2.140 M from gTLDs and $1.496 M from ccTLDs)
      of the total $4.386 million of domain name revenue is shown to
      be from variable sources, for a ratio of 83% variable to 17%
      fixed. However, treating all of the ccTLD budgeted revenue share
      of $1.496 million as variable per the amounts invoiced by ICANN
      does not reflect the view among some ccTLD managers that a large
      share of the support for ICANN should be based on an annual fixed
      amount.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">For the sake of illustration, an allocation
      of 60% variable and 40% fixed revenue to be recovered in the
      revenue structure is used here. This results in an amount of
      $3.000 million for the variable component and $2.000 million
      for the fixed component. It should be noted that in an environment
      of strong growth in the registration of commercial domain names,
      which has been the trend in recent years, a reliance on a high
      annual fixed component disadvantages the non-commercial or otherwise
      slow growing registries, whose relative share in the calculation
      of total revenue would otherwise decline quarter by quarter based
      on registry data.</FONT></P>

      <P><A NAME="E.3"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">E.3 Calculation of
      Variable Component</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The variable category of the revised revennue
      structure is required to recover $3.000M under the assumptions
      in this staff paper. This is accomplished using an algorithm
      first constructed by the TFF to deal with registry and registrar
      activity in .com/net/org. It is extended here to all Domain Name
      Registries. According to the most recent announcement from Net
      Names, domain name registrations currently stand at:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">.com=18M names, .net/org=5M names, and
      all cc's together = 7M names, for a total of 30M names worldwide.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The existing formula for calculating the
      variable component of domain name registry/registrar fees would
      become, under the revised new structure:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Quarterly Fee = .25E x n/N</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Where:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">.25E = division into quarterly payments
      of the approved expense cost recovery budget</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">n = number of domain name registrations
      attributable to a given registry at the close of the quarter</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">N = total number of domain name registrations
      at the close of the quarter</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Example - using data from previous section:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">.25E = .25x$3.000 million = $750K<BR>
      n = .com = 18M<BR>
      N = total registrations = 30M</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">18M/30M = 60% share of total registrations
      = $450,000 per quarter or $1.800M per year if the 60% registry
      share did not change</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">For 1% share of total registrations = 300,000
      names = $7,500 per quarter or $30,000 per year</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">For 1/10th of 1% share of total registrations
      = 30,000 names = $750 per quarter or $3,000 per year</FONT></P>

      of Fixed Component</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Within the fixed category, which under
      the assumptions in this paper needs to recover $2.000M, a range
      of annual fixed amounts is established, which are matched to

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Briefly summarized, ICANN's current revenue
      structure for domain name registries and registrars has four
      components:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(1) Verisign (formerly NSI) Registry pays
        a fixed annual fee of $250,000, which includes the three .com/net/org
        registries.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(2) The .com/net/org registrars, including
        NSI Registrar, pay a variable fee based on their proportionate
        share of the total registrations in .com/net/org which amounts
        to a total of $2.140 M in the current fiscal year budget. The
        shares are recalculated quarterly based on data from Verisign
        Registry and invoices issued accordingly.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(3) The ccTLD registries have been billed
        a total of $1.496M based on their estimated proportionate share
        of total ccTLD name registrations. Some ccTLD registries have
        objected to this formula but have not made an alternative proposal.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(4) The .com/net/org registrars pay an
        annual fixed fee of $5,000 in connection with their registrar
        agreements. We previously &quot;fenced&quot; this in the one
        time category of our revenue budget because we expected a registrar
        group of 20-30 companies and the resulting fees to be totally
        absorbed in administrative costs of processing agreements, etc.
        Subsequently, we have accredited well over a hundred companies
        and we have also committed to the registrar group an aggressive
        support program for them. Thus, we believe this funds component
        should be moved into the continuing revenue category and integrated
        into the general registry/registrar revenue structure.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In addition, items (1) through (3) are
      subject to a TFF recommended division of revenue shares among
      gTLDs, ccTLDs and IP Address Registries of 55%/35%/10%.<BR>
