      This document contains the proposed budget for ICANN for FY2000-2001,
      commencing July 1, 2000, which was presented by the President
      to the Board of Directors on May 4, 2000 in accordance with the
      provisions of <A HREF="/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-10mar00.htm#XI-4">Bylaw
      Article XI, section 4</A>. The proposed budget has been developed
      by the ICANN staff through a consultative process with members
      of ICANN constituencies. An <A HREF="/financials/cairo-fy00-01-budget-issue.htm">earlier
      version</A> was posted on the ICANN web site on March 6 and presented
      at the Cairo public meeting on March 9. The proposed budget was
      discussed by the ICANN Board at its monthly meeting on May 4
      and approved for posting for public comment. The Board will consider
      public comments, make further revisions to the budget if needed,
      and adopt the FY00-01 budget at its scheduled meeting in June
      2000.<BR>
<BR>
      Fiscal year 2000-2001 will be the second full budget year for
      the corporation and the first in which the preparation of the
      budget is based on significant operating experience. The proposed
      expenditures for the next fiscal year are $4.279 million, which
      is $21,000 less than those proposed in the original budget for
      the current year of $4.300 million. (All dollar amounts are in
      US dollars.)<BR>
<BR>
      Revenues for support of continuing expenses are proposed to decline
      from $5.000 million to $4.314 million, which is $686,000 or 14%
      less. This difference reflects the recommendations of the Task
      Force on Funding, which were approved by the ICANN Board in November
      1999. In the category of one-time and special project income,
      there is a year-to-year decline of $190,000.<BR>
<BR>
      The net effect of the changes in budgeted revenue and expense
      from the prior year is a reduction in the budgeted contribution
      to the corporation's operating reserve of $855,000, from $1.600
      million to $745,000.<BR>
<BR>
      The Board has established a goal of creating an operating reserve
      approximately equal to one year's operating expenses. The FY99-00
      and FY00-01 budgets, if fully realized, would accomplish about
      one-third of that objective, with operating reserves projected
      to stand at $1.223 million at June 30, 2001<BR>
<BR>
      Creation of this level of reserve requires that budgeted revenue
      targets in both the current and the next fiscal year are achieved,
      and assumes that currently outstanding short term loans in the
      amount of $1.025 million are repaid on schedule in August, 2000.
      The transition status of ICANN and the slow progress toward reaching
      agreements with major ccTLD managers and with IP Address Registries
      makes the realization of the budgeted surplus and related reserve
      increments subject to some doubt. In the event that assurances
      from ccTLD and IP Address Registry managers with respect to their
      contributions to ICANN are not forthcoming, the proposed budget
      will require revision.<BR>
<BR>
      The following sections of the proposed budget document contain
      additional background information and details of the budget and
      of the budget process for the next fiscal year.</FONT></P>

      Fiscal year 2000-2001 will be the second full budget year for
      the corporation and the first in which the preparation of the
      budget is based on significant operating experience. During the
      startup fiscal period from October 1998, through June 1999, the
      corporation was supported primarily by donations. Total revenue
      for the eight months was $708,000, with total expenses of $1,466,637.
      An operating loss of $758,767 was carried forward to the current
      fiscal year. During the summer of 1999, unsecured loans were
      obtained by the corporation in the total amount of $1.025 million
      to offset the prior year loss and provide working capital. Additional
      accounting detail on the startup period is available at &lt;<A
      HREF="/financials/financial-report-fye-30jun99.htm">http://www.icann.org/financials/financial-report-fye-30jun99.htm</A>&gt;.
<BR>
<BR>
      A budget for fiscal year 1999-2000 was developed by the staff
      and posted for public comment in April 1999. A revised version
      was adopted by the Board at its Berlin meeting on May 27, 1999.
      Following consideration of a mid-year financial report in February
      2000, the Board further revised the FY99-00 budget to bring it
      in line with current projections of revenue and expense. See
      &lt;<A HREF="/general/budget.htm">http://www.icann.org/general/budget.htm</A>&gt;
      and &lt;<A HREF="/financials/financial-report-fpe-31dec99.htm">http://www.icann.org/financials/financial-report-fpe-31dec99.htm</A>&gt;.<BR>
<BR>
      In July 1999, the Board <A HREF="/minutes/minutes-26july99.htm#99.62">directed</A>
      the President to convene a Task Force on Funding (TFF) composed
      of representatives of Domain Name and Address Registries and
      Registrars with the objective of reviewing ICANN budgetary needs
      and making recommendations to the Board. A final draft of the
      TFF report was published in October 1999, and its recommendations
      were adopted by the Board at its Los Angeles meeting on November
      4, 1999. See &lt;<A HREF="../tff/tff.htm">http://www.icann.org/tff/tff.htm</A>&gt;.<BR>
<BR>
      In November 1999, ICANN <A HREF="/nsi/nsi-agreements.htm">executed
      a series of agreements</A> with the United States Department
      of Commerce and with Network Solutions, Inc. that provide, among
      other things, for specified payments to ICANN from the NSI operated
      Registry for the .com, .net and .org domains, and from NSI acting
      as a competitive Registrar in those same domains. These payments
      are projected to reach a total amount in the current year of
      $2.250 million. This amount is included in the schedule accompanying
      the TFF report and in the revised budget for FY99-00. See &lt;<A

<BR>
      <A NAME="IIIB1"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">(1) Income</FONT></B><FONT
       FACE="Arial">. As a result of discussions with the Registry/Registrar
      Budget Group, the amounts and proportionate shares of income
      for continuing expenses from among the three major income sources
      that were recommended by the Task Force on Funding in the fall
      of 1999 and approved by the Board for this fiscal year are changed
      only slightly for the next fiscal year, with a total increase
      in these revenue categories of $39,000, all of which is being
      contributed by the gTLD registrars. <BR>
<BR>
      A budgeted increase in accreditation fees of $460,000 results
      from a very substantial increase in the number of registrars
      accredited for the .com, .net and .org domains. There are offsetting
      incremental expenses associated with administration and monitoring
      of accreditation agreements, which are described below under
      expenses. <BR>
<BR>
      Under Special Project Grants, the $200,000 awarded by the Markle
      Foundation for support of At Large membership startup costs will
      be expended in approximately equal shares between the current
      and next fiscal year. Other grants anticipated in the prior year
      budget have not materialized, producing a year-to-year reduction
      in grant income of $300,000. <BR>
<BR>
      Contributions are projected to decline as a result of ICANN's
      continuing income sources having been established during the
      current fiscal year, with a resulting year-to-year decline of
      $350,000.<BR>
<BR>
      The net of all year-to-year revenue changes is a decrease in
      income from $5.900 million to $5.024 million, or $876,000.<BR>
<BR>
      </FONT><A NAME="IIIB2"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">(2) Expense</FONT></B><FONT
       FACE="Arial">. Overall expense, including equipment acquisition,
      is projected to decrease, on a budget-to-budget basis, from $4.300
      million to $4.279 million, or $21,000. However, there is an increase
      from $2.813 million to $4.279 million, or $1.466 million, from
      the projected actual in the current fiscal year to the proposed
      budget in the next fiscal year. This increase reflects primarily
      the following factors: (1) filling of authorized staff positions,
      (2) holding of four quarterly public and Board meetings rather
      than three, (3) travel and meeting expenses associated with a
      full Board of nineteen Directors and a full staff complement,
      and (4) increased administrative costs associated with full staffing,
      including an increase in space rental and office support. Additional
      detail on specific expense line items is included below.<BR>
<BR>
      </FONT><A NAME="IIIB3"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">(3) Surplus
      and Operating Reserve</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">. The originally
      budgeted surplus of $1.600 million for the current fiscal year
      was earmarked by the Board to offset an initial operating loss
      of $759,000, experienced in the startup period ending 6/30/99,
      and to provide working capital and a down payment on an operating
      reserve for the corporation. The current year surplus is now
      projected at $2.262 million as of June 30, 2000, provided that
      all budgeted revenue is received. As noted above in the <A HREF="#I">Executive
      Summary</A>, delays in reaching agreements with ccTLD and IP
      Address Registry managers have raised concern that the budgeted
      revenue from those sources may not be received, thus jeopardizing
      the corporation's working capital position and threatening its
      ability to repay outstanding short term loans, which are due
      in August, 2000.<BR>
<BR>
      For the next fiscal year, assuming that revenue commitments to
      the continuing expenses of the corporation from its three major
      constituencies are met, a contribution to the operating reserve
      of $745,000 is budgeted. This amount would produce a reserve
      total at the end of the year of $1.223 million, or approximately
      one-third of the planned target of having one year's operating
      expenses covered by reserves. <BR>

<BR>
      <B>(a) Personnel</B>. <A HREF="#IIIC">Exhibit 1</A> in the following
      section contains detail on current staffing levels and position
      descriptions. This category includes all salary, wage, benefit
      and recruiting expenses. It also includes costs of consultants
      and part time employees who are filling staff positions on a
      temporary basis. <BR>
<BR>
      A number of adjustments in positions have been made as a result
      of operating experience. In addition, the number of authorized
      staff positions in the next fiscal year's budget has been increased
      by one to meet increased workload in the registrar accreditation
      area. The year-to-year change in budgeted full time equivalent
      positions is from 14.0 to 15.3. <BR>
<BR>
      Assuming that currently vacant staff positions are filled at
      the midpoint of existing ranges, total personnel costs are projected
      at $1.611 million. This amount may vary up or down based on actual
      recruiting experience in the course of the fiscal year.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>(b)</B> <B>Professional &amp; Technical Services</B>. This
      category includes agreements for legal services and for public
      affairs support. The projected amount of $984,000 is a reduction
      from the current year, which results from filling some of these
      requirements with inhouse staff.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>(c)</B> <B>Board and Public Meetings</B>. This category covers
      expenses associated with the Board's quarterly public forums
      and face-to-face meetings, as well as monthly teleconferences.
      Included are travel, hotel, meeting room, technical and administrative
      support, etc. The projected amount of $600,000 is for four meetings
      and is a decrease from the original budget, primarily as a result
      of the willingness of local host committees of the quarterly
      meetings to significantly defray the costs of the meetings. The
      low number for current year actual is a result of holding three

<BR>
      Introduction</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">. The proposed organization
      plan for ICANN for FY00-01 includes 15.3 full time equivalent
      positions, an increase of 1.3 from the current year. It is Board
      policy that these positions are to be filled flexibly to meet
      the needs of the corporation through a combination of full-time
      and part-time employees, consultants, fellowships and other means
      as appropriate. Positions at the Officer level, except the President,
      may be filled at the Manager level depending on the needs of
      ICANN and the experience of the incumbent. The position descriptions
      shown here will be updated as necessary from time to time. <BR>
<BR>
      Several changes have been made to the staff positions over the
      course of the past year as operating experience has been accumulated.
<BR>
<BR>
      The ICANN Board recently eliminated the position of Chief Technical
      Officer. This position was created in the original ICANN staffing
      plan to support the work of Jon Postel, whose contributions to
      IANA and the Internet were unique and irreplaceable. The Board
      believes that timely and effective technical advice is available
      to it from the members of ICANN's Supporting Organization Councils
      and from other sources and that a full-time staff position of
      CTO is not necessary.<BR>
<BR>
      The positions of Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial
      Officer have been combined into the single position of Business
      and Finance Manager, which more closely reflects actual requirements
      in this area.<BR>
<BR>
      The position of Manager of Publications has been staffed at 0.3FTE,
      rather than full time, so that ICANN/IANA may have the benefit
      of the extensive experience of Joyce Reynolds, who has separate
      responsibilities to the IETF as RFC Editor, a position funded
      by the Internet Society through the USC Information Sciences
      Institute.<BR>
<BR>
      A new position of Registrar Liaison has been created to deal
      with a substantially larger than anticipated workload in the
      registrar accreditation program and will be filled with two full-time
      staff members. <BR>
<BR>
      A new position of Administrative Assistant to the IANA Manager
      has been created to deal with an increase in workload in that
      area as well. <BR>
<BR>
      A Policy Analyst position has been created to provide additional
      support to the Board and to the Supporting Organizations in the
      development of ICANN policy issues. A position formerly identified
      as Technical Specialist is now being filled as Network Administrator.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>Staff Positions</B>. The staff positions and their status
      in May, 2000, is as follows:</FONT></P>

      Budget Process for FY 2000-2001</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Included in the October 1999 report of
      the Task Force on Funding are the following two recommendations:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;The TFF believes that ICANN's budget
        process needs to be improved in future iterations to give the
        entities providing the funds -- the domain name and address registries
        and registrars -- a formal role in the budgeting process. The
        goal of the Task Force's recommendations in this area is greater
        accountability, predictability, participation, and transparency
        in the budgeting process.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot; In addition to the entities directly
        contributing the funds to ICANN's cost-recovery program, the
        rest of the ICANN community must have a fair opportunity to review
        the proposed budget and participate in the consensus-development
        process. The Task Force recommends that ICANN require that the
        proposed annual budget be placed on the agenda for at least one
        Public Forum prior to adoption.&quot;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As noted above, these recommendations have
      been adopted by the Board and are being used to guide the staff
      in developing the next fiscal year's budget. The following specific

      Budget Issues for FY2000-2001</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The following issues, presented as questions,
      are among those which the Board and staff have been considering
      in the development of the budget for FY00-01. Public comment
      on these issues, and others not listed, is encouraged.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Q. Does the preliminary budget properly
      support achievement of the basic purposes of ICANN, which are
      stated in the Articles of Incorporation as:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;... promoting the global public interest
        in the operational stability of the Internet by (i) coordinating
        the assignment of Internet technical parameters as needed to
        maintain universal connectivity on the Internet; (ii) performing
        and overseeing functions related to the coordination of the Internet
        Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;) address space; (iii) performing and
        overseeing functions related to the coordination of the Internet
        domain name system (&quot;DNS&quot;), including the development
        of policies for determining the circumstances under which new
        top-level domains are added to the DNS root system; (iv) overseeing
        operation of the authoritative Internet DNS root server system;
        and (v) engaging in any other related lawful activity in furtherance
        of items (i) through (iv).&quot;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Q. Do the proposed general and specific
      budget priorities for FY00-01 relate appropriately to the purposes
      of ICANN? Since much of ICANN's ability to meet the stated priorities
      is based on staff resources, is the projected staffing of 15.3
      full time equivalent positions the appropriate level of staff?
      For what reasons should the number of ICANN staff positions be
      increased or decreased?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Q. Up to the present time, it has been
      assumed that ICANN's Supporting Organizations will conduct their
      activities without financial support from the central budget,
      relying instead on donated and volunteer services. Is this a
      reasonable assumption? If the SO's are to receive financial support
      in the annual budget, what means should be used to establish
      appropriate support levels and what income sources should be
      used to cover the related expense?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Q. Up to the present time, the operation
      of the thirteen Domain Name System root servers has been subsidized
      by the organizations hosting the machines. Should this volunteer
      system be continued in the future, or should some provision be
      made in the ICANN budget for partial or full support of root
      server operating costs?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Q. Since ICANN's charter is a global one,
      the Board has scheduled its quarterly meetings, including public
      forums, to rotate among the five major geographic regions defined
      in the Bylaws. Should this practice be continued? To what extent
      should webcasting and other electronic outreach techniques be
      continued or expanded?</FONT></P>
