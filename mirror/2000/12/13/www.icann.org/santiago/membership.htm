  <h3>Implementation Reports of ICANN Staff and Counsel</h3>
  <hr width="80%" noshade>
  <p align="left">One of the most important tasks facing ICANN's Initial Board 
    of Directors is the establishment of an At-Large Membership structure.</p>
  <p align="left">At its Berlin meeting in May, the ICANN Board of Directors received 
    the <a href="../macberlin.htm">Final Report</a> of the <a href="../membership-com.html">Membership 
    Advisory Committee</a>.</p>
  <p align="left">In response, the Board &quot;direct[ed] staff to review the 
    MAC Commentary and report back to the Board before the Santiago meeting on 
    the administrative requirements, likely cost, and logistical details of an 
    election process responsive to the MAC Commentary.&quot; [See the <a href="../berlin/berlin-resolutions.html#3">Berlin 
    Resolution on At-Large Membership</a>]. In addition, the Board &quot;direct[ed] 
    counsel to report to it before the Santiago meeting on the legal implications 
    of an election process responsive to the MAC commentary.&quot; Finally, the 
    Board &quot;direct[ed] staff to recommend to the Board a process for repopulating 
    the MAC, so that it can advise the Board on promotion and encouragement of 
    membership and solicitation of sponsorship for outreach programs.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Those reports have now been submitted to the Board and posted 
    for public comment. </p>
