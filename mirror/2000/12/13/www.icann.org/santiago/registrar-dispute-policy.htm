<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1. <B>Purpose.</B> This Domain Name Dispute
Resolution Policy (the &quot;Policy&quot;) is incorporated by
reference into your Registration Agreement, and sets forth the
terms and conditions in connection with a dispute between you
and any party other than us (the registrar) over the registration
and use of an Internet domain name registered by you. <BR>
<BR>
2. <B>Your Representations.</B> By applying to register a domain
name, or by asking us to maintain or renew a domain name registration,
you hereby represent and warrant to us that (a) the statements
that you made in your Registration Agreement are complete and
accurate; (b) to your knowledge, the registration of the domain
name will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of
any third party; (c) you are not registering the domain name for
an unlawful purpose; and (d) you will not knowingly use the domain
name in violation of any applicable laws or regulations. We do
not check to verify, and it is your responsibility to determine,
whether your domain name registration infringes or violates someone
else's rights. <BR>
<BR>
3. <B>Cancellations, Transfers, and Changes</B>. We will cancel,
transfer or otherwise make changes to domain name registrations
under the following circumstances:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We may also cancel, transfer or otherwise
make changes to a domain name registration in accordance with
the terms of your Registration Agreement or other legal requirements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">4. <B>Mandatory Administrative Proceeding</B>.<BR>
<BR>
This Paragraph sets forth the type of disputes for which you are
required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding. These
proceedings will be conducted before one of the administrative
dispute resolution service providers listed at &lt;URL&gt; (each,
a &quot;Provider&quot;).</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">a. <B>Applicable Disputes</B>. You are
  required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding in
  the event that a third party (a &quot;complainant&quot;) asserts
  to the applicable Provider, in compliance with that Provider's
  rules of procedure, that (i) your domain name is identical or
  misleadingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which
  the complainant has rights; and (ii) you have no rights or legitimate
  interests in respect of the domain name; and (iii) your domain
  name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">b. <B>Evidence of Registration and Use
  in Bad Faith</B>. For the purposes of Paragraph 4(a)(iii), the
  following, in particular but without limitation, shall be evidence
  of the registration and use of a domain name in bad faith: (i) offer
  to sell, rent or otherwise transfer the domain name registration
  to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service
  mark or to a competitor of that complainant, for valuable consideration;
  or (ii) your attempt to attract, for financial gain, Internet
  users to your website or other on-line location, by creating
  confusion with the trademark or service mark of the complainant;
  or (iii) your registration of a domain name in order to prevent
  the owner of the trademark or service mark from reflecting the
  mark in a corresponding domain name, provided that a pattern
  of such conduct has been established on your part; or (iv) your
  registration of a domain name in order to disrupt the business
  of a competitor.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">c. <B>Selection of Provider. </B>The Provider
  who will administer a particular proceeding shall be <B>choose
  one</B> [selected by the complainant] <B>or</B> [assigned by
  us].</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">d. <B>Initiation of Proceeding and Process</B>.
  Each Provider's rules of procedure state the process for initiating
  and conducting a proceeding and for selecting the panel that
  will decide the dispute (the &quot;Administrative Panel&quot;).
  The rules of procedure for each Provider appear at &lt;URL&gt;.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">e. <B>Consolidation</B>. In the event of
  multiple disputes between you and a complainant, either you or
  the complainant may petition to consolidate the disputes before
  a single Administrative Panel. This petition shall be made to
  the first Administrative Panel selected to hear a pending dispute
  between the parties. This Administrative Panel may consolidate
  before it all such disputes in its sole discretion, provided
  that (i) such domain name registrations are governed by a domain
  name dispute resolution policy identical to this Policy in all
  material respects; and (ii) all of the disputes are before Providers
  listed at &lt;URL&gt;.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">f. <B>Fees</B>. All fees incurred in connection
  with any dispute before an Administrative Panel pursuant to this
  Policy shall be paid as set forth in the relevant Provider's
  rules of procedure.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">g. <B>Our Involvement in Administrative
  Proceedings</B>. We do not, and will not, participate in the
  administration or conduct of any proceeding before an Administrative
  Panel. In addition, we will not be liable as a result of any
  decisions rendered by the Administrative Panel.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">h. <B>Remedies</B>. The remedies available
  to a complainant pursuant to any proceeding before an Administrative
  Panel shall be limited to requiring the cancellation of your
  domain name or the transfer of your domain name registration
  to the complainant.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">i. <B>Notification and Publication</B>.
  The Provider shall notify us of any decision made by one of its
  Administrative Panels with respect to a domain name you have
  registered with us. All decisions under this Policy will be published
  over the Internet, except when an Administrative Panel determines
  in its sole discretion not to have its decision published.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">j. <B>Availability of Court Proceedings</B>.
  The mandatory administrative proceeding requirements set forth
  in Paragraph 4 shall not prevent either you or the complainant
  from submitting the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction
  for independent resolution before such mandatory administrative
  proceeding is commenced or after such proceeding is concluded.
  If an Administrative Panel decides that your domain name registration
  should be cancelled or transferred, we will wait ten (10) calendar
  days after being informed by the applicable Provider of the Administrative
  Panel's decision before implementing that decision. We will then
  implement the decision unless we have received from you during
  such ten (10) calendar day period a copy of a complaint, file-stamped
  by the clerk of the court, against the complainant regarding
  your right to use your domain name. If we receive such a complaint,
  we will not implement the Administrative Panel's decision, and
  we will take no further action, until (i) we are informed of
  a resolution between the parties; (ii) we are informed that your
  lawsuit has been dismissed or withdrawn; or (iii) we receive
  a copy of an order from such court dismissing your lawsuit or
  ordering that you do not have the right to continue to use your
  domain name.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">5. <B>All Other Disputes and Litigation</B>.
All other disputes between you and any party other than us regarding
your domain name registration that are not brought pursuant to
the mandatory administrative proceeding provisions of Paragraph
4 shall be resolved between you and such other party through any
court, arbitration or other proceeding that may be available.<BR>
<BR>
6. <B>Our Involvement in Disputes.</B> We will not participate
in any way in any dispute between you and any party other than
us regarding the registration and use of your domain name. You
shall not name us as a party or otherwise include us in any such
proceeding. In the event that we are named as a party in any such
proceeding, we reserve the right to raise any and all defenses
deemed appropriate, and to take any other action necessary to
defend ourselves.<BR>
<BR>
7. <B>Maintaining the Status Quo</B>. We will not cancel, transfer,
activate, deactivate, or otherwise change the status of any domain
name registration under this Policy except as provided in Paragraph
3 above.<BR>
<BR>
8. <B>Transfers During a Dispute</B>.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">a. <B>Transfers of a Domain Name to a New
  Holder</B>. You may not transfer your domain name registration
  to another holder (i) during a pending administrative proceeding
  brought pursuant to Paragraph 4 or for a period of fifteen (15)
  calendar days after such proceeding is concluded; or (ii) during
  a pending court proceeding or arbitration commenced regarding
  your domain name unless the party to whom the domain name registration
  is being transferred agrees, in writing, to be bound by the decision
  of the court or arbitrator. We reserve the right to cancel any
  transfer of a domain name registration to another holder that
  is made in violation of this subparagraph.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">b. <B>Changing Registrars</B>. You may
  not transfer your domain name registration to another registrar
  during a pending administrative proceeding brought pursuant to
  Paragraph 4 or for a period of fifteen (15) calendar days after
  such proceeding is concluded. You may transfer administration
  of your domain name registration to another registrar during
  a pending court action or arbitration, provided that (i) the
  domain name you have registered with us shall continue to be
  subject to the proceedings commenced against you in accordance
  with the terms of this Policy; and (ii) the new registrar has
  a domain name dispute policy under which it will recognize and
  implement any decision rendered in any such proceeding. In the
  event that you transfer a domain name registration to us during
  the pendency of a court action or arbitration, such dispute 
  shall remain subject to the domain name dispute policy of the 
  registrar from which the domain name
  registration was transferred.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">9. <B>Policy Modifications</B>. We reserve
the right to modify this Policy at any time. We will post our
revised Policy at &lt;URL&gt; at least thirty (30) calendar days
before it becomes effective. Unless this Policy has already been
invoked, in which event the version of the Policy in effect at
the time it was invoked will apply to you until the dispute is
over, all such changes will be binding upon you with respect to
any domain name registration dispute, whether the dispute arose
before, on or after the effective date of our change. In the event
that you object to a change in this Policy, your sole remedy is
to cancel your domain name registration or transfer your domain
name registration to another registrar, provided that in the event
of a transfer, you will not be entitled to a refund of any fees
you paid to us. The revised Policy will apply to you until you
cancel or transfer your domain name registration.</FONT></P>
