  the ICANN Board, and other legitimately interested parties. The group will present 
  an interim report before the second ICANN public meeting in 2000. A final report

<P><A NAME="anchor16725"></A><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Uniform
Dispute Resolution Policy for gTLD Registrars</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, on April 30, 1999, the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) presented a report with its recommendations
to ICANN on, among other things, a uniform dispute resolution
policy for domain name disputes; and</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, at its Berlin meeting the Board
referred the dispute-resolution recommendations to the Domain
Name Supporting Organization and encouraged the testbed registrars
to develop a model dispute resolution policy for voluntary adoption;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, on August 3, 1999, the DNSO Names
Council submitted to the Board five recommendations on a uniform
dispute resolution policy as consensus positions;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, the testbed registrars, under the
leadership of America Online and register.com, consulted among
themselves and with post-testbed registrars and Network Solutions
and proposed a Model Dispute Resolution Policy for Voluntary Adoption,
which approximately twenty registrars have agreed to adopt; it
is now</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [99.81] that the Board accepts the DNSO's recommendation 
  that ICANN adopt a uniform dispute resolution policy for accredited registrars 
  in the .com, .net, and .org top-level domains;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.82] that the President is directed, 
  with the assistance of ICANN staff and counsel, to prepare implementation documents 
  for approval by the Board after public notice and comment, on a schedule that 
  allows the policy to be put into place within 45 days.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.83] that the Board gives the following 
  guidance as to the preparation of the implementation documents:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><FONT FACE="Arial">1. The registrars' Model Dispute Resolution Policy should 
      be used as a starting point;</FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Arial">2. The President or his delegate should convene a small 
      drafting committee including persons selected by him to express views and 
      consider the interests of the registrar, non-commercial, individual, intellectual 
      property, and business interests;</FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Arial">3. In addition to the factors mentioned in paragraph 
      171(2) of the WIPO report, the following should be considered in determining 
      whether a domain name was registered in bad faith:</FONT> </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><FONT FACE="Arial">(a) Whether the domain name holder is making a legitimate 
        noncommercial or fair use of the mark, without intent to misleadingly 
        divert consumers for commercial gain or to tarnish the mark</FONT></p>
      <p><FONT FACE="Arial">(b) Whether the domain name holder (including individuals, 
        businesses, and other organizations) is commonly known by the domain name, 
        even if the holder has acquired no trademark or service mark rights; and</FONT> 
      </p>
      <p><FONT FACE="Arial">(c) Whether, in seeking payment for transfer of the 
        domain name, the domain name holder has limited its request for payment 
        to its out-of-pocket costs.</FONT> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><FONT FACE="Arial">4. There should be a general parity between the appeal 
      rights of complainants and domain name holders.</FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Arial">5. The dispute policy should seek to define and minimize 
      reverse domain name hijacking;</FONT> </p>
  </blockquote>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.84] that the President is authorized 
  to provisionally approve dispute resolution providers under the uniform dispute 
  resolution policy. From time to time, a list of provisionally approved providers 
  should be compiled and provided to each accredited registrar to be incorporated 
  into its policy. The DNSO is requested to recommend principles for a more formal 
  dispute resolution provider accreditation program for consideration by the Board 
  in 2000.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.85] that the Board requests WIPO to 
  provide recommendations on the topics set forth in a list to be transmitted 
  to WIPO by the President.</FONT></P>

of Initial At Large Director Terms</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [99.86], that under in Article V, Section 1 of 
  the Corporation's bylaws the term of each of the At Large Directors of the Initial 
  Board is extended to expire on the sooner of (i) the seating of the At Large 
  Director's successor selected pursuant to the process referred to in Article 
  V, Section 4(iv) of the Bylaws and (ii) September 30, 2000.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="anchor21816"></A><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">At-Large
Membership</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [99.87] that the At-Large Directors should be selected 
  by an At-Large Council, the members of which are directly elected by the at-large 
  members of ICANN;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.88] that the At-Large Council shall 
  consist of a maximum of 18 members, selected pursuant to an election process 
  to be developed by the President and approved by the Board that is consistent 
  with the following principles:</FONT></P>

        diverse, broadly representative of the Internet user community, and shall 
        consist of at least 5,000 individuals.</FONT> 
      <p><FONT FACE="Arial">2. Of the members of the At-Large Council, at least 
        one and not more than two per region shall be elected directly by the 
        residents of ICANN's 5 defined geographic regions, with each regional 
        Council member elected by the residents of his or her region. The remaining 
        Council members (no more than eight) shall be elected globally by all 
        ICANN At-Large members. A candidate for a regional At Large seat must 
        be a citizen of a country located in that region. No two members of the 
        At Large Council elected from the same region shall be citizens of the 
        same country.</FONT> 
      <p><FONT FACE="Arial">3. Election to the At Large Council should be conducted 
        in at least two stages, if consistent with the selection of at least some 
        At Large Directors prior to July 1, 2000.</FONT>

</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.89] that the President is authorized 
  to convene a Membership Implementation Task Force, which shall generate and 
  implement strategies for outreach and recruitment of a broad and numerous membership 
  that is globally representative of the Internet user community; identify potential 
  sources of funding for the initial At Large Council elections; design effective 
  membership authentication and online election procedures; and monitor and oversee 
  the initial At Large Council elections to ensure that they are conducted openly 
  and fairly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.90] that, while the Board reiterates 
  its determination that the At Large membership will ultimately be expected to 
  fund its operations (including the election process), the President and staff 
  are directed to seek to obtain the necessary funding to conduct the election 
  of the initial At Large Council, and authorized, subject to the availability 
  of adequate funds, to hire or retain sufficient staff support to administer 
  the At Large membership program; support the At Large Council; develop and implement 
  computer and software systems for membership records and online election processes; 
  coordinate the outreach program; and other necessary and related tasks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.91] that the President and staff are 
  directed to prepare implementing bylaws, including a definition of the specific 
  rights of members and the responsibilities and scope of the At Large Council, 
  to be presented to the Board for its review and approval following public notice 
  and comment.</FONT></P>
