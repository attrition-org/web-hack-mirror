<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A meeting of the Board of Directors of the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (the &quot;Corporation&quot;)
was held at 9:00am local time at the Pan Pacific Hotel in Singapore
on March 4, 1999. Of the initial Directors of the Corporation,
the following were present either in person or by telephone: Geraldine
Capdeboscq, George H. Conrades, Gregory L. Crew, Esther Dyson,
Frank Fitzsimmons, Hans Kraaijenbrink, Jun Murai, and Michael
Roberts. Of the initial Directors of the Corporation: (i) Geraldine
Capdeboscq participated in the meeting by telephone until the
point noted in the minutes below; and (ii) Eugenio Triana and
Linda S. Wilson were absent. Also present at the meeting were
Joe Sims, Mike Weinberg (by telephone), Jeff LeVee (by telephone),
and Louis Touton (by telephone) of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue;
and Andrew McLaughlin, Molly Shaffer Van Houweling, and Suzanne
Woolf of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.
Andrew McLaughlin acted as secretary for the meeting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The meeting was called to order by Esther
Dyson. Opening the meeting, Mike Roberts introduced the Board
to Suzanne Woolf, outlining her role on the ICANN/IANA staff and
as staff to the Root Server System Advisory Committee.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="DNSO"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">DOMAIN NAME SUPPORTING
ORGANIZATION</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Joe Sims outlined the status of the Paris
and Barcelona-Monterrey-Washington applications for DNSO recognition
and the statement of consensus principles facilitated by CENTR.
Mike Roberts then presented to the Board the staff's proposal
that the Board: (i) accept neither application in full; (ii) discuss
and, where possible, resolve the remaining areas of disagreement
between the Paris and BMW drafts, in light of comments received
in Singapore and elsewhere, by email, and on the ICANN website;
(iii) prepare and approve a statement of the Board's intentions
articulating consensus principles for the organization of the
DNSO; and (iv) direct the Corporation's staff and counsel to translate
the Board's statement of principles into specific changes and
amendments to the Corporation's Bylaws in the weeks to come.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">After reviewing the substance of public
comments received, the Board proceeded to discuss the various
points of consensus and disagreement among the applications and
drafts and directed Molly Shaffer Van Houweling to prepare a statement
of principles embodying the Board's consensus views, to be considered
for approval later in the meeting.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="RegistrarAccreditation"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">REGISTRAR
ACCREDITATION</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At this point in the meeting, Joan Wasylenki
of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue joined by telephone and was
introduced to the Board.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Following up on the presentation of Joe
Sims to the Board at the March 3 open meeting, Mike Roberts summarized
the substance of the public comments received on the staff's draft
guidelines for the accreditation of registrars in the .com, .org,
and .net generic top level domains. Mike Roberts then presented
and the Board discussed a set of changes to the draft guidelines
proposed by the staff in response to the weight of the public
comments, including: (i) converting the minimum financial qualifications
to safe harbor provisions, to allow smaller firms to compete where
demonstrably appropriate; (ii) lowering the working capital requirement
to USD $70,000; (iii) providing for the confidential handling
of business plans and other confidential information; (iv) assuring
registrars that accreditation will be renewed under then-existing
accreditation standards, absent misconduct or serious failings;
(v) simplifying previously-used IAHC language on technical requirements
to more accurately reflect the goal of ensuring that the prospective
registrar has successfully configured one domain, as a technical
matter; (vi) reducing business uncertainty by requiring that ICANN
act on accreditation applications with reasonable promptness;
(vii) setting the fixed component of the annual registrar accreditation
fee at USD $5,000, and the variable fee component at no more than
USD $1 per domain; (viii) increasing significantly the frequency
of registrar data escrow to daily updates; (ix) requiring registrars
to maintain in force during their accreditation the level of liability
insurance that constitutes the basis for their accreditation;
(x) making clear in the guidelines that domain-name holders will
be permitted to retain their domain names by renewal, absent a
limited and unusual set of circumstances; (xi) setting no maximum
length for the term for any given domain name registration; (xii)
requiring registrars to make reasonable efforts to investigate
and correct inaccuracies in contact data for domain name holders;
(xiii) providing that only a willful failure to provide updated
contact data will constitute grounds for cancellation of the registration;
(xiv) clarifying that the prepayment requirement can be met by
charging a credit card or similar mechanism; (xv) revising the
limited anonymous-registration mechanism to make clear that a
facilitating ISP or second-party domain name holder for an anonymous
third party is liable for harm caused by use of an anonymously-registered
second-level domain, unless the ISP or second-party holder promptly
discloses the identity of the domain name holder upon a reasonable
showing of harm by the requesting party; (vxi) expanding the period
for a registrar to cure a violation of the accreditation agreement
to 30 days; (xvii) providing that arbitrations will be handled
promptly; (xviii) requiring SRS testbed participants to enter
a supplemental agreement to publicly release their non-confidential
operational information and to participate in a public forum at
the conclusion of the test period; and (xix) expressly scheduling
a Board review of the accreditation guidelines for Spring 2000.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A full summary and discussion of the comments
received and other considerations weighed by the Board is attached
as Exhibit A hereto.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Roberts emphasized the staff's general
view that the guidelines should be made less burdensome and more
flexible. Mr. Roberts stated that the staff is ready to implement
a comprehensive program following the Board's statement of policy.
By adopting the proposed policy, Mr. Roberts stated, the Board
would set in motion a series of logistical steps on the part of
the staff to prepare for applications from prospective registrars,
including the preparation of application materials and instructions.
Joe Sims noted that once the first five registrar participants
in the testbed phase of the Shared Registry System were accredited,
those companies will still have to negotiate contracts with Network
Solutions, Inc., subject to the approval of the United States
government.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Board unanimously approved the adoption of the following resolutions:</FONT></P>

    U.S. Government adopted a policy of transitioning management responsibility

    formed by private-sector Internet stakeholders;</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, Amendment 11 ascribed to the not-for-profit

  for accrediting registrars for the .com, .net, and .org top-level
  DNS domains;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, on November 25, 1998, the U.S.

  be in place and the steps necessary to transition DNS management
  functions to the private sector;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, on February 26, 1999, the U.S.
  Government formally recognized ICANN as the &quot;NewCo&quot;
  identified in Amendment 11 of the Cooperative Agreement for the
  purposes of carrying out the functions and activities ascribed
  to &quot;NewCo&quot; in that Amendment;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, on February 8, 1999, proposals
  for registrar-accreditation policies (&quot;Draft Guidelines
  for Accreditation of Internet Domain Name Registrars&quot;),
  attached hereto as <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/draftguidelines.html">Exhibit
  E</A>, were posted on the Corporation's website, providing public
  notice explaining what policies are being considered for adoption
  and why;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, through the Corporation's website
  and otherwise, parties have been provided a reasonable opportunity
  to comment on the adoption of the proposed policies, to see the
  comments of others, and to reply to those comments;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, on March 3, 1999, the Corporation
  held a public forum at which the proposed policies were discussed;

  IT IS NOW RESOLVED [resolution 99.15] that the Corporation accepts
  the U.S. Government's recognition of the Corporation as &quot;NewCo&quot;
  under Amendment 11 to Cooperative Agreement No.&nbsp;NCR-9218742

<P><A NAME="ConflictsofInterest"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">CONFLICTS
OF INTEREST POLICY</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Andrew McLaughlin presented the staff's
draft conflicts of interest policy and recommended that the draft
policy be altered to incorporate a public comment that Board abstentions
from voting on the basis of financial interest or conflict of
interest be reflected in the minutes of the meeting. The Board
proceeded to discuss the seven questions raised in the draft policy,
reaching the following consensus conclusions: (1) the $100 financial
interest standard should be eliminated in favor of the more general,
legally-recognized and -defined standard of &quot;materiality;&quot;
(2) the financial disclosure statements of the Directors of the
Board should not be made public; (3) the question of the applicability
of the conflicts of interest policy to candidates for the At-Large
Board seats should be deferred until the At-Large membership structure
is in place; (4) the financial disclosure statements of Officers
should not be made public; (5) the policy should not apply to
non-Officer employees; (6) the policy should not apply to the
non-Director members of the Corporation's Advisory Committees;
and (7) the minutes of the Conflicts Committee should not include
the personal financial information contained in the disclosure
statements of Directors and Officers.</FONT></P>

items, stating her view that the financial disclosure statements
