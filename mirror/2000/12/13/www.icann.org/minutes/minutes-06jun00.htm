      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">A meeting of the Board of Directors of
      the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (&quot;ICANN&quot;)
      was held by teleconference on June 6, 2000. The following Directors
      of the Corporation were present by telephone: Esther Dyson, Chairman,
      Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Abramatic, Amadeu Abril i Abril, Vint Cerf,
      Jonathan Cohen, Phil Davidson, Ken Fockler, Hans Kraaijenbrink,
      Michael Roberts, Linda S. Wilson, and Pindar Wong. Directors
      Geraldine Capdeboscq, Greg Crew, Jun Murai, and Alejandro Pisanty
      joined the teleconference while it was in progress. Also present
      on the teleconference were Louis Touton, Vice-President, Secretary,
      and General Counsel of the Corporation; Andrew McLaughlin, Chief
      Financial Officer of the Corporation; and Joe Sims of Jones,
      Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue.</FONT></P>

      <P><A NAME="Reconsideration"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">RECOMMENDATION
      OF THE RECONSIDERATION COMMITTEE</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. McLaughlin reported that the <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/reconsideration/">Reconsideration
      Committee</A> has adopted three recommendations, with respect
      to requests 99-1, 00-4, and 00-5, that are ready for Board consideration.
      Early in the Board's discussion of these matters, directors Geraldine
      Capdeboscq, Greg Crew, and Jun Murai joined the teleconference.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Committee has adopted the following
      recommendation on Request for Reconsideration 99-1:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><A NAME="RC99-1"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">[RC 99-1] On June
        25, 1999, the Reconsideration Committee received a request for
        reconsideration from Eric Brunner and Robert Gough relating to
        ICANN's recognition of the Intellectual Property Constituency
        (IPC) of the Domain Name Supporting Organization. The request
        complains of ICANN's decision not to recognize a distinct DNSO
        constituency for &quot;indigenous intellectual property&quot;
        interests. The request raises questions about the Intellectual
        Property Constituency (IPC)'s membership criteria and their application;
        the openness and transparency of its procedures; the process
        by which the IPC was recognized; and whether any bylaws &quot;or
        other guidelines&quot; were violated by the parties involved.
        The request asks for three specific remedies:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;(1) modification of the provisional
          recognition to extend to our group, in effect, partitioning a
          single constituency in recognition that no compromise between
          corporate and indigenous groups was achieved, and that the exclusion
          of either is unnecessary, and actionable.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;(2) modification of subsequent language
          concerning WIPO's work product to reflect its inadequacy, consistent
          with our formal response to WIPO RFC3, on record at WIPO's web
          site.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;(3) modification of the VI-B(3)(b)(7)
          constituency allocation of seats on the Names Council, transferring
          one seat from the group provisionally recognized at Berlin (corporate)
          to our (indigneous) group.&quot;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The crux of the request appears to be a
        feeling that the indigenous intellectual property group led by
        Messrs. Brunner and Gough was not treated fairly by the other
        IPC organizers, and that a separate constituency with its own
        Names Council representative should be created. [Request 2 appears
        to have nothing to do with the recognition of the IPC, reflecting
        instead a substantive disagreement with the recommendations of
        the World Intellectual Property Organization relating to domain
        names.]</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In response to the request, the Reconsideration
        Committee asked a series of questions to the IPC, which are posted
        at http://www.icann.org/reconsideration/ipc-letter-27dec99.htm.
        Mr. Steve Metalitz, then president of the IPC, responded to the
        questions; his response is posted at http://www.icann.org/reconsideration/metalitz-response-10jan00.htm.
        Mr. Brunner followed with a response of his own, posted at http://www.icann.org/reconsideration/brunner-response-13jan00.htm.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Over the past 11 months, the ICANN staff
        and the Reconsideration Committee (in its past and present incarnations)
        have scrutinized the structure and By-laws of the IPC, both in
        theory and in practice. See http://ipc.songbird.com/IPC_Bylaws_dec_15_correct.htm.
        The Committee has observed the operation of the IPC over an extended
        period of time, and concludes that there is no basis on which
        to alter or overturn its recognition by the Board. The IPC is
        open to new members (including Messrs. Brunner and Gough and
        any organizations represented by them); it has applied its membership
        criteria evenhandedly; it is reasonably open and transparent;
        and it was recognized on the basis of a general community consensus
        (which obviously did not include Messrs. Brunner and Gough, but
        was nevertheless an evident consensus).</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Committee notes that all current members
        of the IPC have been required to complete and submit applications
        for membership, something it appears Messrs. Brunner and Gough
        have elected not to do. As Mr. Metalitz notes in his response,
        Messrs. Brunner and Gough have been invited to apply for membership
        in the constituency. Through Mr. Metalitz, the IPC has stated
        publicly its commitment to treat any such applications fairly
        and impartially, consistent with its stated policies. As members
        of the IPC, Messrs. Brunner and Gough would be able to take part
        in its activities and deliberations on an equal basis with any
        other members, and to advocate for indigenous intellectual property
        interests within the IPC and the DNSO. The Reconsideration Committee
        sincerely hopes they will do so. In the meantime, the Committee
        sees no reason to revoke or alter the Board's recognition of
        the IPC.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In sum, the Reconsideration Committee recommends
        that the Board take no action in response to RR 99-1.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">With respect to Request for Reconsideration
      No. 00-4, the Committee adopted the following recommendation:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><A NAME="RC00-4"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">[RC 00-4] On May 6,
        2000, the Reconsideration Committee received a request for reconsideration
        from Bret Fausett, complaining that no minutes for the April
        6, 2000 Special Meeting of the Board had been posted as of the
        time of his request. Mr. Fausett asks the Reconsideration Committee
        to take two steps:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;(a) prompt posting of detailed minutes
          of April 6, 2000 Special Meeting; and</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;(b) formulation of internal ICANN
          policy to ensure future compliance with Article III, Section
          2 of the Bylaws.&quot;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In response to point (a), the Committee
        notes that the minutes for that meeting were posted on March
        [sic, May] 9, approximately twelve days late. Accordingly, this
        request has already been met.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In response to point (b), the Committee
        agrees that ICANN should have an improved procedure for informing
        the community about actions taken during its telephone meetings,
        while nevertheless allowing all 19 members of the Board sufficient
        time to review and edit the draft minutes of the Secretary to
        ensure accuracy before they are publicly posted. The Committee
        believes that this can be accomplished by amending the Bylaws
        to require that any resolutions passed by the Board be posted
        within five (5) business days, while requiring that full minutes
        be posted no later than the day after the date on which the Board
        formally approves them. In that way, ICANN can provide rapid
        notice of actual actions, without having to wait for the entire
        Board to complete its work on the full minutes, which record
        discussions and housekeeping matters.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Article III, Section 2 of the ICANN Bylaws
        currently states:</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In sum, in response to RR 00-4, the Reconsideration
        Committee will recommend to the Board that it consider adoption
        of the foregoing amendment to the Bylaws.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, with respect to Request for Reconsideration
      No. 00-5, the Committee adopted the following recommendation:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><A NAME="RC00-5"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">[RC 00-5] The Reconsideration
        Committee received on 11 May, 2000, a request for reconsideration
        from James Trefil, submitted on behalf of Adam Corelli. Mr. Correlli
        is the registrant of a domain name which was the subject of a
        recent administrative proceeding pursuant to ICANN's Uniform
        Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP). The proceeding
        was handled by the National Arbitration Forum, which posted the
        resulting administrative decision on April 12, 2000 (NAF File
        No. FA0094235). The decision has been posted by the National
        Arbitration Forum at http://www.arbforum.com/domains/decisions/94235.htm.
        Links to the decision have been posted on the ICANN site on the
        various lists of UDRP proceedings and decisions, such as the
        List of Proceedings Arranged by Commencement Date; the List of
        Proceedings Arranged by Proceeding Number; and the List of Proceedings
        Arranged by Domain Name.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Unhappy with the outcome of the administrative
        decision, Mr. Corelli exercised his right under Paragraph 4(k)
        of the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy to challenge the result
        by filing a lawsuit in U.S. federal court (Corelli v. T.M. Pacific
        Co., United States District Court for the Eastern District of
        Virginia, Civ. Action No. 00-701-A, filed April 27, 2000). Quite
        understandably, Mr. Corelli is not pleased with the decision's
        determination of bad faith in his registration and use of the
        domain name.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In his reconsideration request, Mr. Corelli
        asks that the ICANN Board reconsider the decision to maintain
        a link to the administrative decision on the ICANN website. [At
        one point, Mr. Corelli states that ICANN continues to &quot;post&quot;
        the NAF decision &quot;on its web site&quot;. The Committee notes
        that this characterization is mistaken, as the administrative
        decisions are posted by the dispute resolution providers themselves,
        and simply linked from the ICANN site. Likewise, Mr. Corelli
        mistakenly characterizes the decision as being &quot;ICA[N]N's&quot;;
        rather, the decision has been rendered by the National Arbitration
        Forum, an approved dispute resolution provider.]</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Specifically, Mr. Corelli asks &quot;that
        the link to the text of the opinion be removed from ICANN's web
        site, and that the status of the dispute be shown as 'judicial
        determination pending.'&quot; Moreover, &quot;[i]f removing the
        link to the opinion is contrary to an existing ICANN policy,
        Mr. Corelli requests that such policy be reconsidered and modified.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Committee notes that the Uniform Dispute
        Resolution Policy requires dispute resolution providers to publish
        &quot;all decisions under this Policy . . . in full over the
        Internet,&quot; except when the Panel determines to redact portions:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;4.j. Notification and Publication.
          The Provider shall notify us of any decision made by an Administrative
          Panel with respect to a domain name you have registered with
          us. All decisions under this Policy will be published in full
          over the Internet, except when an Administrative Panel determines
          in an exceptional case to redact portions of its decision.&quot;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Likewise, the Rules for the UDRP provide:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;16.(b) Except if the Panel determines
          otherwise (see Paragraph 4(j) of the Policy), the Provider shall
          publish the full decision and the date of its implementation
          on a publicly accessible web site. In any event, the portion
          of any decision determining a complaint to have been brought
          in bad faith (see Paragraph 15(e) of these Rules) shall be published.&quot;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">This policy was adopted after a lengthy
        and open consensus-building process. Many individuals expressed
        a strong view that the administrative dispute resolution providers
        should be required to operate transparently by posting all of
        their decisions on the Internet. The publication of all opinions
        allows the broad community of interested and/or affected individuals
        to analyze and evaluate the results of decisions, the strength
        and validity of the panelists' reasoning, etc. In effect, the
        mandatory posting rule permits any individual to form an independent
        judgment about how well the dispute resolution providers and
        panelists are doing their appointed tasks. Such transparency
        and openness is essential: the UDRP is in its infancy, and public
        scrutiny and input will be necessary if ICANN and the dispute
        resolution providers are to properly evaluate and make improvements
        to the policy.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">While the Policy and Rules apply only to
        registrars and dispute resolution providers, the ICANN staff
        has provided regularly updated web pages that index administrative
        proceedings from all approved dispute resolution providers, including
        information known to ICANN (the existence of the dispute, along
        with a link to or notation of the resolution). The ICANN tables
        do not include notations relating to subsequent litigation, because
        the ICANN staff is simply too small and too overstretched to
        monitor and verify the hundreds of legal disputes that will surely
        ensue. The Reconsideration Committee finds the ICANN staff indices
        to be a valuable service for the benefit of interested and affected
        parties, and believes that ICANN should continue to provide the
        listed information in full.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Moreover, the Committee observes that the
        administration decision which Mr. Corelli objects to is merely
        an administrative decision, setting forth the panelist's view
        of the facts, along with her opinions. While Mr. Corelli is certainly
        correct that his U.S. federal lawsuit may eventually render the
        decision moot, the suit does not alter the fact that an administrative
        proceeding was filed and that it produced a decision. The principles
        of openness and transparency that underlie the UDRP's publication
        rule argue strongly in favor of continuing the publication rule.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Accordingly, the Reconsideration Committee
        recommends that the Board reject Mr. Corelli's requests in RR
        00-5. The Committee urges Messrs. Corelli and Trefil to advocate
        their views on the publication rule to the broader community
        during ICANN's review of the UDRP later this year.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Board discussed the three recommendations
      of the Reconsideration Committee. In the discussion of Request
      00-5, the question was raised whether ICANN should undertake
      to report on its web site the status of court proceedings related
      to UDRP proceedings. Doing so would involve reviewing and making
      assessments about the validity and effect of various documents
      filed in courts throughout the world and would likely lead to
      disputes among the litigating parties as to the accuracy of ICANN's
      posted summaries. It was noted that Request 00-5 was not asking
      that such a procedure be established. In the discussion, the
      ICANN staff was informally advised to place a notice on the pertinent
      web pages alerting readers of the possibility of related court
      proceedings that are not reflected on the web pages, and it has
      done so.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The following motion was duly made, seconded,
      and adopted by the Board:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><A NAME="00.34"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [00.34] that
        the Reconsideration Committee's Recommendations RC 99-1, 00-4,
        and 00-5 are adopted for the reasons stated in those recommendations.
        With respect to RC 00-4, the Board directs the staff to post
        the proposed bylaw changes for public review and comment in advance
        of the Board's meeting in Yokohama.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Roberts noted that the Board's resolutions
      authorizing the signing of checks on behalf of the Corporation

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Touton gave a report summarizing progress
      toward formulation of documents concerning ICANN's relationships
      with ccTLDs. In Cairo, the Government Advisory Committee <A 
      HREF="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/icann/cairo/archive/PT_ccTLD2.html">presented</A>
      a <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">proposal
      concerning the administration and delegation of ccTLDs</A>. The
      Board adopted <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-10mar00.htm#00.13">Resolution
      00.13</A> authorizing the President and staff to work with the
      ccTLD managers, Governmental Advisory Committee, and other interested
      parties to prepare draft language for contracts, policy statements,
      and/or communications, including appropriate funding arrangements,
      to be presented to the Board and posted for public comment. Since
      that time, various groups of ccTLD managers have been working
      on proposals responding to the Government Advisory Committee's
      report, but no document having consensus support among ccTLD
      managers has emerged. A draft agreement is being prepared by
      the staff for possible consideration by the affected parties.
      It would not change the present policies that currently apply
      to ccTLDs, but would provide the flexibility for changes in policy
      to reflect discussions among ccTLD managers, governments, ICANN,
      and others. Once a draft is completed, it will be disseminated
      to the community for comments.</FONT></P>
