<CENTER>[BEGINNING OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]</CENTER>


<P>[??]: I think one of the problems which has to be solved in the near
future, but don't look for the initial board to solve it right away. Like,
maybe I may bring in some of the discussion I am aware of on the trademark
issue and the definition of the famous names. I believe that the business
community and the international community has itself some obligations to
give clarity on this.

<P>As on other occasions, the ICANN board or the ICANN organization will
be the enabler to keep a continuous growing and stable Internet. But many
of the issues are either political issues or are copyright issues, trademark
issues, or international policy issues to be dealt with on an international
level. And what I've learned up to now is that I am, and Jon Postel and
others, and let's say the Internet community at large has been able to
solve these problems, to work their way around without referring to international
treaties, and using what was available. And I believe that at least I would
like to work and build ICANN in that tradition, to set a not-for-profit
private corporation which can stimulate discussion, can guide to solutions
without referring to international treaties and government like structures.

<P>Michael Schneider: Thank you. I am very pleased to find that Keith Gymer
is going to make a statement. Hopefully he will follow up to what he said
earlier and to the ICC's position, for example, on the SOs. Thanks.

<P>Keith Gymer: I'm not going to follow up on that immediately. I was actually
going to pick up on this issue of the ccTLDs and the ISO3166 lists that
Bob, I think, very helpfully clarified. Because I noted that Boudewijn,
in his presentation, stated explicitly that there is no difference between
ccTLDs and GTDLDs other than in the perception of the user. And I think
that's very important to remember for the board in the future. And I hear
exactly what Hans said, that it's obviously not something that the board
wants to leap into considering. But you certainly shouldn't . . . Speaking
from the business perspective, where we're moving to a situation where
we're seeing these ISO3166 TLDs being used in a way which is not the traditional
method of association with a geographic region or the country or location,
but a ________ gTLDs. Those do raise issues which are common to the same
sort of concerns that arise in relation to the existing gTLDs and any future
gTLDs. In that instance, I think it would be very difficult to say that
because you happen to be on the ISO3166 list, you should be treated to
some special level of autonomy which doesn't apply to other gTLDs. And
I think that issue needs to be looked at as a policy issue in the future.
It's one that shouldn't be discounted in saying, oh no, total autonomy
for anyone on 3166 list. I don't think that would be appropriate.

<P>Michael Schneider: I think this requires a statement of one of the ccTLDs
or CENTR.

<P>[??]: It's on the agenda. But what I can say within CENTR, the constituency
of CENTR, the members now, I think all of them are operating in the style
of the sense that the ccTLD is something on a national level. That doesn't
imply automatically that it's not allowed for a ccTLD to register some
name coming from abroad. But that's not the rule.

<P>But there are many ccTLDs within CENTR that are explicitly having a
rule that those who are not incorporated in the country are not allowed
to have a name under that ccTLD.

<P>Michael Schneider: Thank you. Daniel Karrenberg?

<P>Daniel Karrenberg: Daniel Karrenberg again, RIPE-NCC. I'd like to .
. . As somebody not involved in names . . . But I've historically been
involved with some of the ccTLD conflicts and things like that. I'd like
to, for those who are relatively new to this game, put Bob Shaw's comments
into perspective because while they're all true, everything that he has
said is true, the vast majority of the ccTLDs, as far as I know at least,
are operated in the sense that Boudewijn has sketched. By some entity that's
within that country, that very importantly accepts the jurisdiction of
that country and requires a registrant to accept the jurisdiction of that
country which is very convenient, you compare it to gTLDs who have to operate
on a global level. So you shouldn't . . . While everything that Bob has
said is true, you shouldn't get the impression that the whole ccTLD ISO3166
system is falling apart or is being taken over by interests that wants
to turn them into gTLDs.

<P>That is certainly happening, and it's a result of the shortage of genuine
gTLDs. But that doesn't mean that ccTLDs that are operated properly have
no legitimacy at all. To the contrary.

<P>Michael Schneider: Okay, Esther?

<P>Esther Dyson: Yeah. As everybody has pointed out, we have a lot to learn,
and we come to this knowing very little. But I do understand that it's
the fact that things worked okay previously doesn't mean that we don't
need to start thinking about how to make some more formal rules and deal
with things a little more explicitly than was done in the past.

<P>I personally find this issue of ccTLDs fascinating intellectually, as
well as being an important issue. And I see the ccTLDs, especially the
weirder ones, as models of what we might either want to consider or avoid.
But to the extent that they exist, they are kind of a lab for different
policies. And so I think we're going to spend a lot of time trying to understand
this, not simply in order to make policy, but to actually look at it as
kind of a set of experiments in how things work and do not work without
encouraging people to go wild. And then see whether from that we can, in
consultation with all the parties affected, start becoming a little more
explicit and a little more directive about what should be happening.

<P>And so, of course, we welcome all kinds of input and actual information
about what is really happening with a variety of these ISO3166 TLDs.

<P>Michael Schneider: Thank you. Any additional questions or remarks? Please.

<P>Paul Kane: My name is Paul Kane. I'm coming here wearing a number of
hats, one of which we administer a number of small ccTLDs on behalf of
national governments. And actually at the Boston meeting, an administrator
of a ccTLD came forward and asked if we would administer theirs.

<P>The issue I would like to back up, really what Daniel and Boudewijn
said . . . It is relatively easy to have a restrictive practice, only to
reserve ccTLDs for nationals. However, it is also very easy for third parties
to act as effectively nominee holders of ccTLDs to circumvent such regulation.
And through experience, it is easier to have an open-door policy with policies
well defined so that should someone violate the rights of third parties,
they are fundamentally nailed. And that, in itself, is effectively like
a self-regulating, self-policing activity.

<P>Wearing another hat, we are fundamentally a data processing house, and
we run databases for a number of G7 information society[??] projects. Some
935,000 users currently are in our system. And the thing that is fundamental
to all users, I believe, on the Internet, is stability. And I would urge
that if ICANN is considering any changes, it does so very slowly, rather
than potentially suggesting policy for comment a little possibly prematurely.

<P>And whilst I agree that there is need for some ccTLDs to have a direct,
possibly an agreement with the ICANN board, possibly such things should
be clearly thought through on a longer-term basis. And possibly by the
fall board of ICANN rather than the interim board. Just a few thoughts.
Thanks.

<P>Michael Schneider: Thank you. I should like to encourage the other speakers
to limit their statements to one or one and a half minute, due to time
constraints, please.

<P>Philip Sheppard: Thank you. It's Philip Sheppard here from AIM, the
European Brand Association. I'd just like to raise one word, which is that
of trust. The way businesses, successful long-term in the past has been
where you build consumer trust. This is going to be no different on the
Internet, and trust in electronic commerce is absolutely essential.

<P>Where trust is undermined is where you have deception and where you
have confusion. And I think where we've seen uses of country codes as pseudo
gTLDs is precisely where there was intentional deception and intentional
confusion. I think it does the long-term future of the Internet no good
at all if we are sort of happy with that sort of thing in the past. Because
we must be looking to the future and, in particular, to our responsibilities
I think here, in saying that user trust on the Internet should be the fundament
for the ICANN board wishes to establish. And therefore, removing abuse
like this misuse of the ISO codes, I think, should be a very important
principle that I would like them to consider at the earliest possible stage.

<P>Michael Schneider: Thank you. Any other statements? Please.

<P>Siegfried Langenbach: My name is Siegfried Langenbach. I am coming from
Germany and speaking on behalf of myself this time. Esther and Hans mentioned
some timeframes they were thinking of. And I would like to know a little
bit more about these, about your imaginations of the next steps, when the
supporting organization should be installed, when they, in your opinion,
should start activities.

<P>Esther Dyson: To be honest, probably slower than we expect. We'd like
to do this, as I mentioned earlier, as quickly as possible, but not before
these supporting organizations are ready. And so, as we found with our
own establishment, these things often take longer than anybody plans. And
I can tell you when our next board meetings are. They are in March and
at the end of May. And those are the points at which we make big informal
decisions following proposals, open comment, and so forth. And so to some
extent, it depends on whether there are SOs ready to be recognized. And
we just heard that that may not happen by March, so it may be at the end
of May.

<P>[??]: May I add something? Supposing the address part is ready to start
and the other was not because they have some problems of whatever it is.
Is it assumable that it will start, for example, with the one supporting
organization only?

<P>Esther Dyson: Yeah, that's entirely possible they will come in one at
a time. And, in fact, that's probably going to be easier in terms of .
. . Again, we don't want to make our decisions hastily, and making them
one at a time is probably easier. Because when the time comes, we're going
to have to hear from at least one supporting organization, possibly several.
We're going to have to hear from their critics. It's not a simple send
in a form and we'll recognize you kind of process. And we're hearing both
do things right away as long as you do them the way we want, and don't
do anything at all until you know everything. Don't let the initial board
do anything at all. And so, again, we're dealing with a lot of conflicting
advice, and we need to operate deliberately and make sure that we earn
that trust by doing the right thing and by being seen to do the right thing.

<P>[??]: Allow me a final question to the floor before I ensure that we
get our slot in the queue. Not considering the delegation of new gTLDs,
and taking into consideration that the issue between the U.S. government
and NSI has been settled, does anybody of you see any good reason to rush
now with regard to the establishment of the NSO or with regard to any action
in the DNS?

<P>Amadeu Abril i Abril: Amadeu Abril i Abril speaking. Personally, I do
not understand the question. You say, some reason for rushing into that?
The question should be, is there any reason for delaying ICANN doing its
work and the supporting organization working? And I would like saying something
about what Hans Kraaijenbrink said before. He said, you know, talking about
the domain and supporting organization and the participant ____________,
I encourage all of you to strike compromises in everything and try to come
with agreements.

<P>Well, yes and no. As Bob has said, there are some registries that prefers
self-dealing and registering domain names for themselves in the ______________.
You will never make these people agree for clear economic reasons. With
those that think that about the registration be publicly available in order
to make _________ searches and the conflicts resolution policies easier.

<P>You will not make easily compromises between those that think that the
data into the database registries are the proprietary right of the registry
and those who believe that they are public resources. You will not have
easily convincing everyone to agree whether lots of new gTLDs or no gTLDs
is the best thing, because there are people on both sides and many of them
in between with valid reasons for all of them.

<P>Indeed, making everybody agree 100% is impossible. You will need, as
a board, to strike whether is to the side, whether there is 90 or 95% agreement
on something, and then you can go forward or not. If not, nothing will
happen. Absolutely nothing will happen in the domain name area. And remember,
this is your best bet. Protocols and numbers had been run quite smoothly
for the last years, and within all these grand plans for ensuring continuity
and stability there yet. It probably will be the case in some years, but
not yet.

<P>The really sticky question was domain names. And somehow, ICANN's usefulness
will be judged with, you know, against the ability of taking reasonable
decisions on that that satisfy the larger person of the Internet community
and the general business allot [??].

<P>Michael Schneider: Thank you. I allow one further comment on my question,
please.

<P>Werner Staub: My name is Werner Staub. I come from . . ., and I speak
for myself at this time. When I hear the question rushing or delaying,
I very often get the impression that people talk about people just being
impatient or people wanting improvements. I don't think that's the situation
we have here.

<P>We have a patient here. The best picture that we could use would be
a cartoon of the last century by ______________, who pictured doctors quarreling
while the patient dies. And that is precisely what I am concerned about.

<P>We have to look at the figures, and the figures are we have in an accumulation
of power in some locations, especially in one location, don't need to name
it, that is changing the equilibrium progressively so that it is no longer
going to be the same thing. We've already seen the results, up to now,
in terms of decisions not being possible anymore. Corrections no longer
being possible, like if you look at the rights to the NSI database and
discussion, it turned out that action came too late. It was no longer possible
to correct it, and the power of that basically undocumented ownership,
was basically just cast in concrete by dollars. And we have to be concerned
about that. This is a moving system, and this system is going to move,
whatever we do, even if we do nothing. And if we don't act, we will possibly
not be able to recognize it in the future.

<P>Michael Schneider: Thank you. I think those have been two great final
statements and I now should like to hand over to Esther Dyson and Christopher
Wilkinson for their wrapup and for lunch.

<P>Esther Dyson: Honestly, I don't think we're ready to wrap up yet. I
think we will go to lunch and continue the discussion. Most of these issues
are combined, and so this has been very helpful, not that it has led us
to any decisions, but I look forward to more after lunch. And Christopher
is going to . . . Is there anything we need to tell them?

<P>Christopher Wilkinson: I think there are enough people who have been
here that have [drop in tape] The cafeteria is on the fifth floor. There
are a number of restaurants in the vicinity. We reconvene at 2 o'clock.

<P>[LUNCH BREAK]

<P>Christopher Wilkinson: Good afternoon. Welcome back. Just a few minutes
late, I apologize. The moderator for this session will be Thomas Bertrand.
He represents the high level strategy group of the electronic telecommunications
and related and consumer electronics industries of . . . He's been an active
member of the European community panel of participants, many members of
which are here present. So let me pass the floor over to him and his speakers,
which he will introduce. Madame G&eacute;raldine Capdeboscq, a member of
the board, has also agreed to reply to the debate on behalf of the ICANN
board. But, of course, all the board members and other participants who
wish to contribute to the discussion in the time available will be able
to take the floor. Over to you, Thomas. Thank you.

<P>Thomas Bertrand: Thank you, Christopher. Just as a lead in, my name
is Thomas Bertrand, and I am representing, today, the HLSG, as Christopher
said, the high level strategy group. This is made up . . . Essentially,
this is a . . . For lack of a better term, a working group made up of Etno
[??] which is network operators in Europe, ECTEL, which is communications
equipment manufacturers, Eurobit, which is IT equipment manufacturers,
as well as SATEBU which is broadcasting in cable operators. And, of course,
ECAM which is electronic consumer products in Europe. So there are five
different trade associations which are working together within the HLSG,
particularly on standards, strategic standards issues. And this is, obviously,
a topic of great interest to us.

<P>I hope you all enjoyed your caloric intermission, and that between the
cold outside and the number of bottles of Beaujolais Nouveau still circulating,
I hope that we can have a bit of an energized session this afternoon.

<P>From the HLSG perspective, I would like to provide support today. We
give our support, today, to the ICANN organization. We believe that it
should reflect the role of IANA. This was a body that has continued to
provide the administration and numbering functions of the Internet. This
is a critical role to our businesses. It is also vital that this transfer
take place in a timely manner. It is also very important that it remain.
We welcome this session today, and we believe it's important this level
of transparence continue. And I understand from Esther's earlier presentation,
this is the plan. We welcome that decision.

<P>There also has to be a very efficient and effective body in place because
the level of innovation today taking place will put significant demands
upon this body in terms of . . . Just as an example, next year, a number
of very large PC manufacturers will be integrating high-speed Internet
modems as a standard component in a number of their PCs, the home PCs,
etc.

<P>Another issue is, for example, is the fact that wearable computers are
no longer science fiction films or very specific applications. These are
applications that will be hitting the market within the next couple of
years. So these will put enormous pressures on a body which is there to
serve the administrative function. And stet need to be aware of that in
designing this body or implementing the design in terms of being flexible
to the requirements or the needs this type of innovation will create.

<P>I must make one point in that I would have preferred to have seen more
representatives from ICANN at the meeting. I understand, though, that while
we're here discussing the question of ICANN, most of the other reps are
back in the U.S. discussing the question of can I? Can I eat more turkey?
Can I eat more apple pie in the annual feast of Thanksgiving? That's forgivable.
But the point being that for us, the HLSG, most of us are global operators,
obviously, and we have a global focus. There is no regional issues or divide
for us, so we need to see that it is the operation of the ICANN body. I
see no reason why it wouldn't be so.

<P>Let me move quickly into our presentation. We have a very broad topic:
industrial end-user aspects. And I let the speakers define a bit of the
issues so that we can move quickly into a discussion following that. Our
first speaker will be Cecilia Jorgensen from IT Finance where she has been
a managing director. Our second speaker will be Christian Van der Valk,
who is here from ICC, the International Chamber of Commerce, where he is
a deputy director of policy commissions. And finally, G&eacute;raldine,
from the board of ICANN, will present briefly. Can I ask Cecilia to start
please?

<P>Cecilia Jorgensen: Good afternoon. I would just to like to give perhaps
a few background about myself. IT Finance is a company specializing in
Internet training for senior management. This was started in late '95,
and before that, I was a Vice President for J.P. Morgan. For your information,
I am also the chairperson for the forming committee of the Internet Society
chapter of Belgium, which is, in fact, going to get started now in December.
So whoever is interested in joining us, we are very happy to see you.

<P>Well, I was ________ only two days ago by the European commission to
speak about user issues. It means that my observations are fairly rapidly
pulled together. Before we get started, I would like to define the word
user. And I've, in fact, drawn a little model here that we are going to
work from which shows, in fact, what's happening in our society today.
I'm going to do it very fast, don't worry. We're talking about the information
age society and what does that mean? Does it work?

<P>What it means is that we have a big change process taking place. The
change process is driven by Internet technologies. And you see that one
in the middle, a round ball, it's not very round, but this was not me drawing
it. This represents the driving force of our society today. And in that
little ball are all people involved in the Internet systems. I think you're
all here today, the registrars, the DNS systems, the telecom providers,
it's all a whole series of organizations and providers helping to drive
the new information age process.

<P>So, the three balls around this Internet which is pushing them, who
are they? Well, the first one is up to the righthand corner. It's basically
what I call . . . It's pushing the lifestyle changes of individuals. The
catch word is empowerment of the individual. The individual is now able
to purchase on the Internet. He can have communication all over the world.
I mean, I don't have to give you the whole list of items that the individual
can do today which he couldn't do before Internet came into place.

<P>And that lifestyle change drives changes as well into the little ball
at the bottom, and that is strategy. Company strategies have to change
in order to meet the new behavior of the individual. So that is the strategy
at the bottom there, and then we have the ball up there to the left that
is the organization itself. New organization structures are needed.

<P>And today, what I am going to speak about is the lifestyle, because
that is the entry point, in fact for most people. The individual end-user.
I've identified four, let's say, points that I think is important for the
end-user. Now these points are not unique. Nothing is unique today. I mean,
we have heard about them many times before. I have just sorted them in
a little bit of a different way, perhaps, and I've actually changed my
sorting as I sat through these sessions today, because ICANN itself . .
. I wasn't quite sure what the mission for ICANN was. And from this morning's
session, I can see that there's a very much focus on the technical side.
So I'm starting with that, in fact, that one of the four needs of the end-user
is a reliable infrastructure. That's what we heard here before. That was
one of the missions of ICANN to provide that.

<P>Now in the infrastructure, I also include, of course, not of course,
but I also include a good regulatory system. For the user, this is part
of an infrastructure that can work. During the round table recently, Sir
Leon Britain said, "What we need now are global laws, not detailed national
laws. But the laws have to be feasible to implement." The new privacy law
in Sweden, where people were prohibited from posting individual stet persons'
name on the Internet without their approval, is impossible to implement.
Local governments can only control local production, but not local consumption.

<P>When I think about, because I think you are particularly interested,
of course, on the ISP registrars and what users wants from them, from ISP,
we want to be sure that we are dealing with correct people. And I can give
you an example in Belgium. The Internet Society Association, the ISPA,
the Internet Service Providers Association, they have created a certain
document called codes of conduct. I think that's an excellent initiative,
and I'm sure that perhaps it exists in other countries.

<P>The registrar in Belgium, Professor Verbaten [??], happens to be an
ideal person. He is very ethical, he has got a great sense of responsibility,
and he can, himself, be an arbitrator on domain name issues. But is that
. . . So in all countries, I don't know. At least some kind of function
has to exist which ensures that these organizations are behaving in a good
way to the end-users.

<P>So that was the infrastructure. Secondly, what the end-user needs is
some kind of consumer protection. I can see a model which probably could
be of interest to ICANN, although it might not be in your mission, eh?
And that is the Security and Exchange Commission. I don't know if you have
heard about that one. It's an American organization that is there to protect
the private investors. So you can really feel that you can go to them for
complaints if you felt that you were misled in your share purchases or
any other thing.

<P>And this organization is extremely busy to track down Internet fraud
now on investments. I think that is a very good model that should be needed
for Internet as well. And I think ICANN would be the ideal organization
for that, because we need one organization, and this is what we have. And
I think it's the common denominator for all of us when it goes to Internet.

<P>Other organizations that could help in that is the Internet Society.
This is a very very important end user organization which I am actually
starting myself, as I said. But they have chapters in nearly 30 countries,
and there are new ones starting all the time in formation.

<P>The consumer protection should also include, let's say, lobbying for
more reasonable prices on the telecom companies. I can give you, again,
Belgium as an example, which I know the best. We pay $3.00 almost, per
hour, for a connection. Now that is pretty bad if you want to promote the
Internet development in Belgium, especially when you look at the United
States, where you can call for free. So immediately we're going to see
some very awkward and unfair, let's say, treatment of Internet users. And
somebody needs to think about these issues. And I think as I said, ICANN
would be a perfect organization for that.

<P>Okay, the third item that I'm talking about which might be a bit detailed
here, but we need to have meaningful ground rules. With ground rules, I
mean not really loss, but let's say common conduit. And somebody has to
put them down somewhere on a piece of paper. Today, we are self-governed,
and I think it works fine, but it works even better if we can somehow put
it down on a piece of paper. I'm just giving a few examples.

<P>Unsolicited mail. There are easy ways to stop that. Two, intelligence
ordering[??] cookies, I mean, you know, users are concerned about being
tracked for their behavior and who they are. But they are not all bad either.
It sometimes is good to get targeted advertising for _______ perhaps, so
it's not all bad things. But again, somebody has to put some kind of rules
in place not only sort of hoping that everybody is following these standards.

<P>And talking about standards, we also have commercial ethics. I don't
know how many of you have not been stuck with an online subscription and
not being able to cancel it. I have. I tried for eight months to cancel
my MSNBC subscription, and this is a serious company. Finally, I call American
Express, ask them to stop my credit card, and they said, can't do it. You
have to cancel your whole card, otherwise we cannot do it. Now that is
a problem, I think, too.

<P>And then, of course, we have harmful content and I'm more particularly
thinking of parents, children, children getting access to pornography.
And, also, the sheer nature of Internet with its interactivity, where these
children can participate in chat rooms with nobody supervising them. I
think that's a serious problem where we need also to have some rules or
some kind of a supervisory system.

<P>The fourth item, which is my pet favorite, that is called the need for
education. That is absolutely critical. We cannot just have a whole work
generation growing up just by learning themselves. I call it not being
able to eat with knife and fork. I mean, I have been into the Internet
world here since '95, and I find it sort of very complex. I mean, it's
people communicate their thoughts and it's hundreds of papers, there is
no structure, and we need to have some kind of improved education in that
area. That's my opinion. And also, for the parents, again, who is supposed
to check what their kids are doing.

<P>Also for regulators, if you want to regulate, you have to understand
what it is. And that is why we have put the little arrow into lifestyle.
If you want to enter this whole information age, which comprises all of
these four balls, you have to know, yourself, how this works. That is what
I teach the senior managers who are already extremely isolated in their
organizations. They'd rather stay completely away than to be part of it.
But I just spoke over lunch, and you said that soon everything in the company
will be posted on the Intranet, which is another topic. So you have to
know how to do it. Pensioners are getting on with it too now. They are
also learning how to use this tool.

<P>Finally, I would like to, then, in this context, quote U.S. Senator
McGovern who said recently, "There are three issues that block the development
of Internet. The first one is education. The second one is education. And
the third one . . ." I'm not going to say it. I think that's all I had
to say. If you have any questions, I would be happy to take them.

<P>Thomas Bertrand: I think we'll save the questions for the end. Can you
please get the . . . I appreciate your help. Thank you Cecilia for a very
interesting point of view from the stakeholder point of view, the stakeholder
point of view of a user which we don't hear very often, especially the
end-user. I need to reply immediately, though, as being a representative
of an industry, the HLSG, I need to reply immediately in saying that we
do not foresee . . . We certainly do not wish that the ICANN become involved
in these rather global policy issues. ICANN has clearly an administrative
task in front of it, and it needs to focus in doing that task as best as
possible in the shortest time as possible. I think many people agree on
that. I'm not making anything astounding a pronouncement here. But we would
certainly not support the role of ICANN into these policy issues such as
security, data protection. There are other ways . . .

<P>[??]: Content control.

<P>Thomas Bertrand: Content, etc., thank you. I think you might have had
a reply as well. You asked to make a reply. [Drop in tape] Then I would
like to move on, then, perhaps, then, from my point of view, from ICC.
Christian? Thank you.

<P>Christian Van der Valk: Right. Okay. I was. Good afternoon, everyone.
I was even more unfortunate, because I only found out that I would be a
speaker this morning. So during part of the morning session, I put together
a very small PowerPoint presentation on partially what the ICC is, just
for your general information, and a few words about the ICC's views on
some of the governance and domain names issues that we've been talking
about.

<P>As a general introduction, the ICC is a . . . We call ourselves a world
business organization, and I think that's justified. The ICC represents
all types of business in about 130 countries. And if I say all types of
business, it includes shipping companies, insurance companies, but also
ISPs and anyone who would call himself a business is welcome to join the
ICC. And companies throughout the world have been doing that for about
80 years now, to do mostly, one of the things that we've been talking about
in the context of Internet and electronic commerce quite a bit, and that
is self-regulation.

<P>For 80 years, the ICC has been producing rules that apply to international
transactions and business, globally, in quite a large number of fields
that are not only being respected by business, but also being respected
by governments and courts of justice throughout the world, applied as though
it is the law.

<P>So self-regulations, one of my main points . . .
<CENTER>[END OF SIDE A; BEGINNING OF SIDE B]</CENTER>


<P>Christian Van der Valk: . . . last centuries, if not for much longer
since the beginning of all commercial activity.

<P>The ICC is, and I have to apologize, my battery has run out, so I have
to look at my own slides behind me, the ICC is also operating the largest
commercial arbitration court in the world. We settle hundreds of multibillion-dollar
cases every month. And the ICC, obviously, is interfacing with global government
organizations such as the U.N. and the U.N., agencies. Next slide, please.

<P>This also, then, looking at what the ICC has been doing as general background,
in the field of electronic commerce, we have been developing sort of extending
that traditional ICC role into the field of electronic commerce. We've
been active in that doing self-regulation for EDI. And today, we have produced
a number of rules, guidelines, and codes in different fields relating to
electronic commerce that are being applied by commercial players, again,
throughout the world.

<P>Finally, one of the things I would like to mention is that at the OECD
ministerial that was held last month or two months ago, the ICC together
with a large number of other global business organizations, put together
what we call the global action plan for electronic commerce. That was supported
by about 200 other organizations that tries to set out, comprehensively,
which issues need to be addressed in electronic commerce, and by whom,
in order to get a clearer picture of what the respective agendas of business,
business organizations, and governments and governmental organizations
are. Next slide, please.

<P>Then in the field of Internet governance and domain names, the ICC has
pulled together about a year and a half ago an international task force
of business people from all continents that look at the different issues
involved. And they have articulated as their main objective or the main
objective of the transition that we're talking about here, and as the development
of an effective, stable and equitable system of Internet government and
the domain name administration. Next slide.

<P>You will have seen . . .If not, I would encourage you to go and pick
one up. At the table at the door, we have made available copies of the
ICC's foundation paper called ICC Principles for An Electronic Commerce
Friendly Domain Name System. This slide just briefly summarizes some of
the objectives that that paper sets out from a business and user point
of view.

<P>The ICC, traditionally, is a great supporter of competition. One of
the things that was not mentioned here, but obviously runs throughout this
presentation, I hope, is the need from a business user point of view, competition.
And competition is absolutely essential for this tool to work and even
for governance to work.

<P>Stability, integrity, and security. Obviously, again, it was said before
from a user, from a sort of general business point of view, are absolutely
essential issues. Predictability and certainty are part of that.

<P>Secondly, we believe that business is the primary force of future investment
in the Internet. It creates and trades most of the value that is traded
over the Internet. And we feel that business ought to be fully included
in not only the processes, but even in the formation of the different processes
that we are talking about and we're trying to promote that.

<P>There's a number of other principles that I don't think I should repeat,
just to be a little bit brief. I would ask you to pick up one of those
papers and read it carefully, if you're interested. I'll otherwise be ready
to take questions afterwards. Thank you.

<P>Thomas Bertrand: Thank you, Christian. I'd like to have our final speaker
then, G&eacute;raldine, give us the point of view from ICANN, since this
is the reason that we're all here today. Thank you.

<P>G&eacute;raldine Capdeboscq: I have been asked to speak about the industrial
aspects, probably because I am coming from the industry. You know that
I am one of the members of ICANN who are not at all participating in the
process before a small number of weeks, I think now. And it is for me and
this will be my contribution which is to hear and understand how we can,
as well as possible, answer the different questions which are reasoned
by all these discussions we have and all the requests which are pushed
on ICANN to be solved rapidly.

<P>I understand that while the first point is that for the users, I speak
first of the industrial users. Very certainly, a problem which is to be
sure that there will be continuity and that the ICANN organization will
be able to continue what has been well done by IANA before. And this is
____ be our goal and this is, obviously, an area where we have . . . We
are pretty sure that we will have the correct supporter of the technical
information and technical organization. And this will be probably done
not easily, but very . . . One of the first of our activities.

<P>The second aspect is probably one which I have heard strongly was the
relationship with the ISPs. With two kind of questions. The first one was,
they want to have an efficient system, and probably there is the question
of the relationship between the registries and the common APIs of the relation,
the way information will be used through different registries. So this
is certainly something on which we will have to work.

<P>The second point which has been strongly mentioned this morning, was
the fact that it seems to be a need for very increased number of IP addresses.
And this means that we have to work on this subject rapidly. There is .
. . It was in the process of establishing our bylaws, probably one of the
subjects which was not covered. At the same time, in terms of openness,
clarity, and concern about the fact that we ought to take into consideration
the needs from each area of the world and have support from different countries.

<P>When we speak of the industrial aspects, also it's inhibitance [??]
that industry is commercial and that the key subject will be the relationship
with the trademarks and intellectual property organizations. This will
be . . . That was by the following round table. So I just mentioned it,
but I think this is very important, and it will be one of our preoccupation
[??] to create the correct bridges and have the good relationship with
those organizations which are working on the different subjects to provide
us in this area, as you know the areas, the best information, the best
corporation so that we can find the good ways to solve these difficult
questions.

<P>For the end-users, the question is how to associate easily the name
and the address. And this has also different aspects. It is certainly done
by important industries, but there is a lot of potentialities to create
newer activities in this area. The end-users want to have the same name
everywhere, even if it can be the case for societies, organization. It
can be the case for individual users. But it doesn't take the same way
to solve this kind of problem, so we have . . . We will have certain need
to take council and be informed about the ways to solve these kind of questions.

<P>There will be probably also the need to develop directories in the different
registries, or there is a certain number of subjects which have been written
and we have to be more informed about it to know what we can do on this
subject.

<P>Just to be sure upon the question, behind all of this, we will not be
able to deal with all the contents of all the different aspects which were
reasoned by the previous interrogators[??]. We want to have the maximum
information coming from different organizations dealing on different subjects,
and how our real objective will be to take the time and the efficiency
and the rapidly, however, the time to come to provoke discussion and consensus
and create a ground for solutions which will be as much as possible, based
on anonymity, but certainly not always based on anonymity. Very soon based
on efficiency and rapidity to answer the needs which are provided by all
of you and which will be given to us to solve.

<P>Thomas Bertrand: Thank you, G&eacute;raldine. That was a very quick
______________ from the end-user perspective to the very broad commercial
interest of the International Chamber of Commerce, finally ending up with
G&eacute;raldine's perspective from ICANN.

<P>I would like to open it up now for questions. Please respect the previous
protocol of introducing yourself first and which organization you are from
and who you are representing. And the time, yeah. We have a very tight
schedule. Questions?

<P>Anthony ________: Thank you Mr. Chairman. My name is Anthony ________
and I wear two or three different hats. The hat I am wearing for this question
is chairman of round table three and the ICT partnership organized by DG13.
We look at quality of service. It's a term I have not heard. The question
is, does either IETF or either one of the associated organizations deal
with the quality of service issues? If not, will you be tackling this topic,
or is it outside your limit?

<P>And also, among the audience, are there anyone who is interested in
working on quality of service, or is there some studies being carried out?
Thank you.

<P>Esther Dyson: First, I have a question. Do you mean quality of service
in the sense of service quality, or quality of service in terms of protocols
for guaranteeing it?

<P>Anthony __________: Yes. Quality of service as seen by the user. In
particular, the e-mail and telephony over IP. So it would be the call user's
parameters as accuracy, quality of the security aspects, the quality of
the mail when you receive ___________ and the way it has been sent, and
in the case of telephony it will be quality of speech, etc. It would be
those parameters which are of relevance to the user.

<P>Esther Dyson: Someone from the audience may also want to answer. But
let me just . . . Pardon? Oh, go ahead. Okay, I want to step back a moment
and kind of clarify what ICANN is for.

<P>The example of the Securities and Exchange Commission, I liked in one
sense in that although it is U.S. based, investors actually and particularly
companies wanting to raise money go to the United States in order to come
under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The problem
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, of course, is that it is run
by the U.S. government. And we are not. We are run by an international
board, and, therefore, it's appropriate for us to operate worldwide.

<P>But it is likewise not appropriate for us to deal with a lot of issues,
and those include, as noted before, consumer protection, content control,
fraud, redress of fraud, service quality, all those kinds of things. They
follow from some of the standards that are set by the IETF and the protocols
and the protocol supporting organization that we will recognize in due
course, but we are not directly connected with those issues. And we are
very careful to be controlling only the administration of some of the basic
functions. We are not a government, and, therefore, we do not want to take
over a lot of government functions. And for better or worse, that is the
way we are currently designed.

<P>Thomas Bertrand: Thank you. Any other points or questions?

<P>[??]: With this comment from Professor _____, I am one person interested
in this aspect of quality of service. As Esther has said, ICANN is not
that involved in deciding this aspect. But, of course, there are many many
parameters affecting the policy's definition. In establishing criteria
for _____________ to become a registry, to become a registrar, and to incorporate
the quality of service perspective in those criteria because we are, of
course, interested, too, in providing this kind of quality of service.

<P>On the other hand, in the sideline aspects is . . . For instance, in
the definition of protocols and standards __________ today is a normal
practice, but it's important to insist on to incorporate this interest
of quality of service. And I think that the approach, for instance, related,
is very familiar in telecommunication. You know very well about the comparable
performance indicators that is used in telecommunication business could
be translated in some way to the services that leave[??] over Internet.
But it's a matter probably more of . . . natural to deal with in some of
the supporting organizations.

<P>Esther Dyson: I am going to take the liberty of continuing to talk for
a second, partly because what I see as open meetings is that you can actually
watch the board learning and discussing these issues. And Eugenio has made
some very good points that certainly, quality of service delivered is going
to be one of the criteria that we expect to operate in the competing registrars
that ultimately will arrive.

<P>One point I would like to make here is that we are very concerned as
an organization to foster competition. And our hope is that most of those
criteria will be set in the marketplace by competition rather than simply
by ICANN or even its designees. We're very much hoping to see a market
in which market forces foster these kinds of results. And, of course, we
will make sure that somehow that happens.

<P>[??]: Yeah, market forces need not necessarily give you the best of
. . . The best it can give you the lowest common denominator. There is
a date . . .

<P>Esther Dyson: We'll do that later.

<P>Thomas Bertrand: Thank you. Next question, please?

<P>Manuel Hurtado: Thank you, Mr. President. Again, Manuel Hurtado from
Asimelec, the Spanish Association of I Space. I see many things are happening
here. I would like to speaking in a powerful industry, high space. We deal
directly with the consumer, with the user. We talk to them every single
day. We may get some needs. We identify part of the needs.

<P>I agree with Esther that . . . Sorry I agree . . . I prefer be auditing
by the market in my quality that for any kind of regulations. If I have
any kind of bad quality in terms of services, of course I will be out of
the market.

<P>Either question is, if in this quality controls, will be a quality control
of the process in terms of protocols, _____ elements, all these kind of
things that make guarantee correct application , you know, then to give
a balance _____ to everyone to protect their business or those situation.
In terms of contents, we're dealing here with cultural behaviors, and cultural
aspects. We always know that the thing this absolutely ________ in one
country will be absolutely forbidding in other ones. So governments, they
also have to work in their own way.

<P>We may go to a newspaper stand in different countries and we may buy
different items, depending in which country we are. So I would like to
encourage IANA, new IANA, the ICANN, excuse me, this is the old _____,
ICANN to go ahead and set up the basis and I invite the people on the floor,
because at the end, the responsibility will be on our side, to participate
in this supporting organizations will be no time to claim if we leave past
the time longer, because in the middle time, we will have a lot of conflict
that we have to resolve in America's future[??] So, anyway, we would like
to encourage ICANN to distinguish between the part that they have to regulate
and the part that the market would regulate by theirselves.

<P>Thomas Bertrand: Thank you. I don't know if there is a response from
ICANN on that or accept that as given? Another question down front?

<P>Erik Huizer: Erik Huizer, Internet Architecture Board. I'd like to go
on on what you just said and react to the presentation by Cecilia Jorgensen
at the same time, is, indeed, distinguish between the Internet as the information
on there and the uses that's made of it. The Internet as a technical entity
with its protocols, and the Internet parameters that need to be registered.
And ICANN is only going to deal with this last part. ICANN is not, in my
view, going to deal with contents of the Internet and regulation of contents,
and will certainly not deal with protocols and standards on the Internet.

<P>Let me make it absolutely clear that if there is a protocol standards,
protocol supporting organization, and the IETF will be part of that, that
we will still decide what standards will be made. And in the traditional
way, we will do that in very close cooperation with the market. And with
the ISPs and with software and hardware providers, etc. But it's not ICANN
that decides what kind of standards we will make. Once we've made a standard
and it needs parameters which needs to be assigned and registered, that's
when we will ask ICANN to take on that task. It's not the other way around
because[??] ICANN is going to decide which kind of standards we are going
to make.

<P>Thomas Bertrand: Thank you. I had one last question out back?

<P>Fred Eisner: My name is Fred Eisner. I am representing, I think, the
European ISPs. I am President and CEO of the Dutch IPSA. I want to go in
a bit more on the subject that Ms. G&eacute;raldine Capdeboscq raised,
and also the rest of the description I heard, because we are largely _________
great concerns about let's say two topics. The relation with ISPs, I share
that with Ms. G&eacute;raldine Capdeboscq. But I hear relation with ISPs
and self-regulation. Those are two terms we hear a lot, last week in the
States and also here in Brussels.

<P>As ISPs, we have, let's say, we are looking very critical at that because
we are the ones who are running the actual domain name system for all the
customers. I think it goes for more than 90% of the people here when you
start up your browser and you type in www.icann.org, it's the DNS of your
provider, who is providing you with the correct IP address.

<P>So self-regulation, in this business, is very close to us. ISPs . .
. I read in the papers, ISPs are considered part of the industry. We are
not in the board. There is no supporting organization for that. That's
one of the worries we have because we have to implement the policy, we
have to do a lot of the technical work, and we do the day-to-day operations.
Now we are very glad there was always a very good organization who did
that job. There is now standing up another organization who is going to
do that job, ICANN . . . We understand it's your problem, but we make it
our problem also.

<P>They offered a set of rules, the bylaws. They offered an organization.
They offered the board of directors. And they want to do that job for us,
for you, for all the world to see. The problem is, the way the things are
going and the debate is running, we still have the question when, and if
there is a consensus on doing that job. We still think there isn't. There
is no general international acceptance, as you might say, because a large
part of the Internet industry being the ISP industry, ISP industry is not
all Internet industry, but we think ISP industry is a crucial part of Internet
industry.

<P>Still have a few problems, and those were also the problems Ms. G&eacute;raldine
Capdeboscq mentioned. We would like to emphasize them. Because we still
think, still after the last change, we still think the rules are inadequate.
They are leaving too much open for the board to change at will. And that's,
of course, a problem because, the second problem, the board is selected,
well, let's say, in a not very transparent process, and still not very
open in its decision making.

<P>And we think the board is imbalanced, not quite put together representative,
because, well, you can see what I am leading toward. All of the ISP industry
is not incorporated in the whole of the decision making. And some other
organizations are. That's a bit like . . . It remembers me . . . It reminds
me of Animal Farm. We do it for the build[??] and all animals are equal
but some animals are more equal than others. That's why we say, well, the
board is a bit imbalanced. And we say either you make the board representative,
but then you make it really representative, or you don't make it representative
at all, and you choose the members through other criteria. Either way,
that's still open to us, it's still open to discussion. But you have to
choose. You can't just say, "Well now we made a choice and we call it a
consensus." I'd like to state there is no consensus at this time.

<P>Thomas Bertrand: How about a rough consensus? Seriously, though, I understand
you have an issue. You have an opinion, but I've been following quite closely
the process, and I've seen the ________ letters . . . response made to
this particular issue by ICANN, the letter to the United States government,
because these issues have been brought up by the Department of Commerce
to the ICANN body. And maybe you'll pass that to Esther, but I think these
issues have been covered at some length. While they're still valid opinions,
I don't know if we need to cover that in great length here. Can I ask .
. . ?

<P>Fred Eisner: Well maybe _____ it by interference. We are not asking
for a solution as yet. We just think while the process is still going on,
while every organization who is putting himself forward to say, "We do
a task" or "We have a responsibility," we think, also, the other sounds
have to be heard.

<P>Thomas Bertrand: I completely agree. Can I ask someone from ICANN to
speak, please?

<P>Esther Dyson: I want to respond in two ways. One, simply to correct
a fact. There are, in fact, two members of the board who are intimately
connected with the ISP industry: George Conrades was, in fact, CEO of BBN/GTE
Internetworking. You may consider that not a representative ISP because
it was so large, but it was.

<P>And I, personally, am an investor, and through my fund, own about a
third of an ISP in Poland called Poland Online. And I would take exception
to that not being considered to be a serious operation. We are an ISP;
we have all the same problems every other ISP has, including being ignored.
And so, I assure you that there is some representation for ISPs on the
board.

<P>Nonetheless, I understand your concerns, and there's a further answer,
which is, you're right. We were not elected. That's why we are going to
resign within two years, because we should be replaced by people who are
elected by an at-large membership and a supporting organization membership.
We are going to make sure that the various SOs represent a consensus that
includes ISPs in whatever they do, and I would assume that one way or another,
the ISPs will also be somehow represented among the at-large membership
and maybe more directly.

<P>So, please keep giving us constructive criticism. Do keep giving us
advice, and we hope you will find that we're responsive.

<P>Thomas Bertrand: Just on the same subject, please, I see a hand in the
back?

<P>Dennis Jennings: Dennis Jennings, University College, Dublin. I have
some difficulty understanding some of the contributions in this session.
Because it seems to me that people are stating a problem, but not relating
that problem to the mechanisms that are being discussed or to the roles
and responsibilities of ICANN.

<P>It would seem to me that if the ISPs have a particular concern, then
those concerns should be addressed as proposals in the context of either
the protocol supporting organization, the address supporting organization,
the name supporting organization, or the at-large. But to simply state
a problem and dump it and say, "I have a problem," is really not a very
constructive way of moving this forward, in my opinion.

<P>Thomas Bertrand: Thank you. I think we'll close here. And I would like
to thank the speakers and the ICANN officials. And we can take this up
later. There is another discussion at the end with the whole panel. Thank
you, again. And I'd like to thank, again, the commission and ICANN for
having organized this, what I hope is a number or a series of future open
meetings. They seem to be quite useful. Thank you.

<P>[??]: Thank you. Can we have the trademark team on board as quickly
as possible. Thank you very much, Bertrand. [Drop in tape]

<P>Keith Gymer: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. If we move on, we're
running slightly behind so this session will go now till 10 to, so we've
only got 45 minutes instead of the original planned one hour. So we'll
move on quickly. It's entitled Trademarks and Dispute Resolution, but that
certainly wasn't intended to be restrictive and consistent with the scope
of the WIPO processes for those of you who are familiar with it. I certainly
intend this to be open to discussion of dispute prevention as well as dispute
resolution, and if necessary, to touch on the issue of famous marks and
gTLDs where they impact on the trademark issue as well.

<P>I don't think there can be many people who aren't aware of the disputes
and the types of dispute that are being on between trademark owners and
domain name owners. The issue has, as a result I think perhaps wrongly
and unfortunately, come to be polarized. It's seen as a polarized debate
between owners of trademark rights and domain name registrants at-large.
And I think that is actually unfortunate and not one that should be taken
forward as I'm sure Geert will go into that further.

<P>There are a number of important initiatives taking place now, pursuant
to the white paper, one of which is the WIPO initiative which you should
be familiar with, and Francis Gurry will be talking on that for a few minutes
later. And there's also a parallel initiative going to be initiated, if
it hasn't already been in the States, following Senator Lahey's initiative
there, I think, Esther.

<P>And it has been noted since we're in the . . . People have been in the
mood for pointing out where they perceive that ICANN board members might
not be experts in the issues. Of course, in the trade, various people have
suggested that there may not be any ICANN board expertise in trademark
issues. I'll leave it to us. Correct me if I'm wrong on that, but it's
certainly . . . I'm sure that from a trademark and commercial perspective,
we would strongly recommend that the ICANN board takes full note of the
WIPO process and WIPO's contribution, because WIPO certainly is an acknowledged
expert in that area, and has made strenuous efforts to undertake a very
wide consultation process on this issue.

<P>Without any adieu then, in view of the short time, I shall move on and
introduce Geert Glas, my first speaker. Geert is from Loeff Claes, Verbeek,
a large Belgian law firm, and has been the chair of the INTA Internet subcommittee
for the last year. He has also been INTA's representative on POC, and I
guess is going to give us a few overheads. So if you could switch them
on, thank you.

<P>Geert Glas: Thank you, Keith. Okay. We're actually a totally new team,
the gentleman who is putting up the slides and myself, so we'll have to
rehearse a little bit as to how that goes. Mostly when I nod my head, it's
about time to move the slide. However, I nod my head a lot when I talk.

<P>The first slide which is coming on is actually one of saying, when you
talk about the trademark owner's position, what is it not. And when I talk
about trademark owners, I have one clear mandate, that is, to talk on behalf
of the International Trademark Association, which has about 3 to 4,000
members and about 120 different countries in the world. I do not pretend
to be able to talk on behalf of other organizations, although I am aware
of the fact that other organizations have views which are similar to the
ones that INTA has defended in the past and is defending today.

<P>What is it not? I think it is not as Keith has suggested, a fight. Trademark
owners . . . First, there's domain name owners. I think, at some point,
people have tried to push both categories or both situations in a different
category, and so that's the real fight. We don't think that is true. We
think that it's . . . that you do injustice if you portray it that way,
because as a matter of fact, a lot of domain name owners happen to have
trademarks and a lot of trademark owners happen to have domain names. So
I think that's the wrong perception.

<P>The second thing which is not as . . . I do not come here as a representative
of the International Trademark Association to say in a Khruschev way, no,
no, no. The trademark owner's point of view is not one of an obstinate
refusal of any new gTLDs. It's not an obstinate refusal against any change
of the current system.

<P>A second no is, or a third no is, we've tried. We're not always successful
in that way, but we've tried since day one not to sit on the fence. And
INTA was involved in the original IAHC, was involved in POC, and tries
to remain involved, because I think that, in a way, sitting on the fence
is maybe not the best way to try to influence the process and to have a
voice in it.

<P>And fourthly, what we're not about is we're not there to derail the
whole process. We're not there to say ICANN has no authority, ICANN should
not be there, etc. We're not there to derail it.

<P>Four recommendations is a strong word, but four issues. One, the new
gTLDs. In our view, it's something one should not talk about in abstract.
You can't really have a debate as to should there be additional ones or
should there not, because you have to look at the specific situations.
Clearly from a trademark owner's perspective, noncommercial gTLDs are far
less threatening than commercial ones. In the old IAHC and then POC plan,
there was .nom[??] for individuals in order to prevent that Mr. Dupont
[??] basically has his Dupont [??] TLD and then the company Dupont [??]
can't have one anymore. I think, clearly, from a trademark owner's perspective,
that's not much of a threat.

<P>The same thing with political, religious, and other gTLDs. At the beginning
of POC, there was a proposal. Bob Shaw, I think, can testify to that, of
I think IATA, who wished to have a .air gTLD, saying, "We are the International,
what is it, "Air Transport Association." We have members. We'd like to
administer a .air domain space. And we have our rules. I mean not everybody
can just become a member of IATA, and we'll just do that.

<P>And clearly, we know that's something that from a trademark owner's
perspective, you can't be very much against. So we say let's distinguish
between gTLDs. And don't say, they're all good or they're all bad. What
we also say is that the WIPO process is probably the first time that people
have really looked at the issue in an organized and reasoned way. Because
there's been lots of gut feelings about this. I mean people have said I'm
convinced that there should be another 100 gTLDs. As people have said,
I am convinced there should be none. I think it's the merit of the WIPO
process that Francis will talk about that at least for the first time,
the questions asked to a lot of people, there is input from a lot of capitals
in the world. And we support that initiative fully, and people of the INTA
have been both in the experts panel and testifying before. We welcome that
initiative.

<P>Which is why we say in the end, as INTA, our approach is what we call
a reasoned go slow. Reasoned in the sense that we like there to be a serious
debate. We like there to be a little bit evidence as to what is the effect
of additional gTLDs on trademarks, etc. And we think that that's what WIPO
is doing and what will come out of the WIPO process, which, in a way, is
also a hints[??] that we would have a hard time understanding if ICANN
or the DNSO would not even await the outcome of the WIPO process before
making . . . And make decisions in that regard.

<P>It's a reasoned approach. It's also a go slow approach, because we do
believe that should it appear that, indeed, additional gTLDs are necessary
or should be implemented, that you should do so not in an avalanche way,
but that you should do so in a go slow process, one by one or two by two.

<P>The second issue which is dear to our heart: minimum standards for domain
name registrations. It's a little bit of a slogan, but we say, "Accountability
means identity." In the sense that if you have a domain name out there,
if you want to be active on the Web, well we think that we should know
or that as a third party, you should know who is behind a domain name.
And people have valid privacy concerns about this.

<P>But our view is that those privacy concerns can be met in a different
way and do not outbalance the fact that as a third party, have the right
who is the owner of who has a domain name. And so we plead for contact
addresses for service of process addresses to know who is this person,
who is this company and where can I contact him and, if necessary, where
can I sue them because of the content of what's on his Web page or because
of the name itself.

<P>We like people to accept the jurisdiction. We like the ISPs to clearly
state, in their contract, with whoever signs up a domain name, that by
doing so, you do accept the jurisdiction forever of, for example, of that
particular ISP. Because there's nothing more frustrating than to have a
conflict that's with somebody and to have no place in the world to bring
the dispute that you have with that person. And we also plead for an accessible,
be it a database or a Web page, but a way of getting that information in
a public and clear way.

<P>We don't go as far as I once called somebody who we call a cyber squatter
who had registered a couple of hundred . . .
