        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Whereas, the Domain Name Supporting Organization

        trademarks in the context of introduction of new TLDs;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Whereas, the Names Council of the DNSO

        including the recommendation that the Board establish a policy

        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Whereas, on 15 July 2000 a public forum
        was held in Yokohama concerning the issues discussed in the staff

        the President is authorized to implement this policy according
        to the following schedule, which the President may adjust if
        necessary to accommodate circumstances that arise:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">1 August 2000 - ICANN to issue a formal
          call for proposals by those seeking to sponsor or operate one
          or more new TLDs, accompanied by a New TLD Registry Application
          Form, instructions for filling out the application, and a statement
          of criteria for the Board's eventual decision.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">1 October 2000 - Deadline for ICANN's receipt
          of applications. Portions of these applications deemed appropriate

          of negotiations.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><A NAME="00.48"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">Resolved [00.48], the
        President is authorized to establish a non-refundable fee of
        USD $50,000 for the submission of an application to become a
        sponsor or operator of a registry, which the Board finds is a
        reasonable estimate of ICANN's costs likely to be associated
        with receipt and evaluation of such applications, and follow-up.</FONT></P>
        <P><A NAME="00.49"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">Resolved [00.49], in
        connection with applications, the President should seek information
        that he determines is appropriate. Without limiting the information
        that may be sought, the Board commends to the President's consideration
        the data elements described in section IV of the staff paper,
        and also notes that the data elements should include:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">full information about the technical, business,

          contemplated to promote orderly registration of names in the
          initial phases of introduction of the TLD;</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">full details concerning arrangements proposed
          to protect users in the event of registry failure; and</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">measures proposed for minimizing use of
          the TLD to carry out infringements or other abuses of intellectual
          property rights.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><A NAME="00.50"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">Resolved [00.50], that
        the President is authorized to establish guidelines for assessing
        which proposals to select for negotiations toward entry of agreements
        with registry sponsors and operators. The Board commends the
        following topics to the President for inclusion in the guidelines:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The need to maintain the Internet's stability,
          and especially the protection of domain-name holders from the
          effects of registry or registration-system failure.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The extent to which selection of the proposal
          would lead to an effective &quot;proof of concept&quot; concerning
          the introduction of top-level domains in the future, including
          the diversity the proposal would bring to the program, such as
          fully open top level domains, restricted and chartered domains
          with limited scope, noncommercial domains, and personal domains;
          and a variety of business models and geographic locations.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The enhancement of competition for registration
          services at the registry and registrar level.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The enhancement of the utility of the DNS.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The evaluation of delegation of policy-formulation
          functions for special-purpose TLDs to appropriate organizations.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The extent to which the proposal would
          meet previously unmet types of needs.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The importance of appropriate protections
          of rights of others, including intellectual property rights,
          in connection with the operation of the TLD, especially during
          the start-up phases.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><A NAME="00.51"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">Resolved [00.51], that
        the President is authorized to seek technical advice from appropriate
