Mr. Triana noted that it may be appropriate at a future date to
consider the appointment of a Chief Technical Officer as well.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><A NAME="BoardRelationswithSOs"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">BOARD
RELATIONS WITH SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
The Board discussed designating specific members of the Board
to act as liaison to each of the supporting organization councils
and determined that it will consider such an appointment if a
need appears to arise.<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Kraaijenbrink asked that a future agenda include a review
of the relationship of the supporting organizations to the Board
of Directors.<BR>
<BR>
Ms. Capdeboscq noted that a future agenda might also include a
review of the process for replacing the original, appointed Directors
with their elected successors once the At-Large Membership Council
is in position to make appointments to the Board.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><A NAME="AgreementswithDOCandNSI"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">AGREEMENTS
WITH U.S. COMMERCE DEPARTMENT AND NETWORK SOLUTIONS</FONT></B><FONT
 FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
Messrs. Sims and Touton distributed to the Board the set of proposed
agreements among Network Solutions, Inc. the U.S. Department of
Commerce, and the Corporation. These proposed agreements were
the result of extensive negotiation. After several months of negotiations
by the three parties, a tentative agreement was reached and <A
HREF="http://www.icann.org/nsi/tentative-agreements.htm">draft
agreements</A> were posted for public comment on September 28,
1999. A large number of <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/mb/agreements/?expire=100000">written
comments</A> were received on these agreements, some in favor
of the agreements, some opposed, and some suggesting modifications.
At the public forum held on November 3, 1999, a number of stakeholders
raised concerns about various provisions of the agreement. In
particular, a group of accredited registrars presented a <A HREF="minutes-04nov99-7points.htm">seven-point
list of concerns</A> with the terms of the agreement. In response
to these concerns, the Corporation's attorneys conducted additional
negotiations with Network Solutions and Department of Commerce
personnel to discuss the points of concern that had been raised,
including those raised by the registrars during the public forum
on November 3.<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Touton then reviewed the specific provisions of the Registry
Agreement, the Zone File Access Agreement, the Registrar Accreditation
Agreement, the Transition Agreement, the Registrar Licensing Agreement,
Amendment 19 to the Co-operative Agreement, and additional Amendment
1 to the Memorandum of Understanding in detail with the Board.
He explained the changes that had been negotiated overnight. Those
changes from the previously posted version of the documents were
incorporated in the new agreements, and addressed six of the seven
<BR>
points raised by the registrars, as well as other comments that
had been made in writing and at the public forum. He indicated
the staff's view that the other point raised by the registrars
(<A HREF="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-04nov99-7points.htm#Point4">Point
No. 4</A>)--proposing a change in the approval procedure for financial
contributions by the registrars--would risk unstable finances
for the Corporation in the future. Accordingly, he recommended
that no changes be made to address the seventh point. <BR>
<BR>
Counsel advised the Board that, other than the changes described
above made in response to comments, no substantive changes had
been made to the agreements since publication on the ICANN web
site.<BR>
<BR>
In response to a question, counsel confirmed that the registrar
community had seen the documents and contributed to the terms
to the extent possible, given the quick nature of the discussions
due to the timing of the Board meeting.<BR>
<BR>
The Board discussed the agreements and the changes.<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Abril i Abril noted that, while he did not like the agreements,
he felt that they were the best under the circumstances and he
noted his concern related to the potential continuing influence
of the U.S. Department of Commerce.<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Fockler noted the ability of the Board to monitor compliance
with the agreements and the outcome related to competition.<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Triana noted that the agreements would stabilize the Corporation's
financial situation.<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Conrades noted the value of moving forward with the important
duties of ICANN once the agreements are in place.<BR>
<BR>
Ms. Wilson noted that it continues to be important to receive
the comments of the registrar community as the relationships unfold
under the agreements.<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Kraaijenbrink concurred that it is important to move forward
with the responsibilities of ICANN.<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Cohen thanked all of the individuals involved in the negotiations,
which he noted were challenging and extensive and commended them
on a successful outcome.<BR>
<BR>
Ms. Capdeboscq also commended the negotiators and noted that there
are many important issues related to the next tasks of ICANN including
addressing issues related to country-code delegations and the
root servers. She said it continues to be important to complete
the internationalization process of the oversight of technical
aspects of the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Wong said that he would abstain from voting on the agreements
because he was new to the Board and unfamiliar with them but that
he supported the policy they represent and that he was pleased
with their substance.<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Roberts noted that the development of the relationship with
Network Solutions had consumed much of the time and attention
of the Board and staff and said he was pleased that the agreements
would allow the Corporation to proceed with other important components
of its mission.<BR>
<BR>
Ms. Dyson said that, while not perfect, the agreements represent
a fair and open way to level the playing field in registering
domain names and move forward to other challenges and added her
thanks to all involved in the negotiations.<BR>
<BR>
Upon motion duly made and seconded, the Board approved the adoption
of the following resolutions:</FONT></P>

Mr. Crew reported on the development of an At-Large Membership
and a process for direct election of an At-Large Council, in two
stages, which will in turn select nine At-Large Board members
in 2000. He reported on the grant of funding in the amount of
$200,000 pledged by <BR>
the Markle Foundation to assist with administrative and outreach
aspects of the process of forming the At-Large Membership and
electing the At-Large Council. He said that the next step would
be the creation of a task force to assist with implementation
of the At-Large Membership and reviewed related resolutions with
the Board.<BR>
<BR>
Several members of the Board expressed their appreciation to the
Markle Foundation for its financial support of the implementation
of this important part of the Corporation's structure. Several
Directors emphasized that the Markle Foundation's financial support
will not <BR>
result in special influence over policy matters for the Markle
Foundation and its other grant recipients. Mr. McLaughlin noted
