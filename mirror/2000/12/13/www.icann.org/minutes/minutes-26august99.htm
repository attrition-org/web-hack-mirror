<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A meeting of the Initial Board of Directors
of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (the
&quot;Corporation&quot;) was held at 8:35 a.m. local time at the
Facultada de Ciencias Economicas y Administrativas, University
of Chile, 267 Avenida Diagonal Paraguay, Santiago, Chile, on August
26, 1999.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The following Initial Directors of the Corporation
were present: Gregory L. Crew, Esther Dyson, Frank Fitzsimmons,
Hans Kraaijenbrink, Jun Murai, Michael Roberts, and Linda Wilson.
The following Initial Directors were absent: Geraldine Capdeboscq,
George H. Conrades, and Eugenio Triana.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Also present at the meeting were Joe Sims
and Louis Touton of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue; and Andrew
McLaughlin and Ann Marie Plubell of the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers. Ann Marie Plubell acted as Secretary
for the meeting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The meeting was called to order by the Interim
Chairman, Esther Dyson. Ms. Dyson reviewed the procedures for
the meeting, noting that members of the public are welcome as
observers. Mr. Michael Roberts, Interim President and Chief Executive
Officer of ICANN and a member of the Initial Board of Directors
then reviewed the agenda.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="DirectorTerms"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">TERMS OF
THE ORIGINAL DIRECTORS SELECTED BY THE SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Fitzsimmons reviewed the background
for the proposed change of the reference to the initial term of
the Directors selected by the Supporting Organizations from &quot;October
1, 1998&quot; to &quot;October 1, 1999&quot;. Ms. Wilson noted
that it continues to be important that the Supporting Organizations
retain their focus on selecting well-qualified directors from
the beginning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Initial Board unanimously approved the adoption of the following
resolution:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><A NAME="99.73"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [99.73], that
  the date &quot;October 1, 1998&quot; in the third sentence of
  Article V, Section 9(d) of the Bylaws is replaced with &quot;October
  1, 1999&quot;.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="PSO"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">PROTOCOL SUPPORTING
ORGANIZATION</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Roberts reviewed the background and
noted the extensive discussions which led to the proposed resolution
before the Initial Board of Directors to ratify the Protocol Supporting
Organization Memorandum of Understanding that was signed by ICANN,
the IETF, the W3C, and ETSI, along with related changes to the
ICANN Bylaws.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Initial Board unanimously approved the adoption of the following
resolutions:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS the President signed a Memorandum

  Oslo on July 14, 1999, it is now</FONT></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="ASO"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">ADDRESS SUPPORTING
ORGANIZATION</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Kraaijenbrink reviewed the extensive
discussions with interested parties related to the formation of
the Address Supporting Organization (ASO) and read the related
proposed resolutions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In response to a question from the Interim
Chairman, Mr. Kraaijenbrink confirmed that the purpose of the
review mechanism provided for in the proposed resolution is to
ensure a periodic check on the mission and progress of the ASO,
and is similar to the review procedure established for the PSO.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Initial Board unanimously approved the adoption of the following
resolutions:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><A NAME="99.76"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [99.76] that
  the Board accepts the proposal for the formation of a Memorandum-of-Understanding-based
  Address Supporting Organization (ASO) submitted by ARIN, RIPE
  NCC, and APNIC.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="99.77"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [99.77] that
  the Interim President and CEO is authorized and directed to prepare
  implementing Bylaws and to sign an appropriate Memorandum of
  Understanding in cooperation with the proponents of the proposal,
  subject to ratification by the Board. The Interim President and
  CEO is further directed to ensure that the Memorandum of Understanding
  includes a review mechanism similar to that set forth in the
  Protocol Supporting Organization Memorandum of Understanding,
  to occur periodically, the first review to occur by the time
  of ICANN's Annual Meeting in 2000.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="99.78"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [99.78] that
  the Board notes with approval the continuing efforts toward the
  organization and establishment of new regional Internet registries
  for the African and Latin American/Caribbean geographic regions
  (AFRINIC and LACNIC), notes the strong support for these efforts
  among the existing regional internet registries, and encourages
  all parties involved to work expeditiously to complete the necessary
  structural and technical tasks to enable the new registries to
  sign the MoU as soon as possible. Pending final recognition of
  the new regional internet registries, the Board encourages the
  ASO Council to involve representatives of those registries in
  the activities of the ASO as observers.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="AdHocGroup"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">AD HOC GROUP
ON FUTURE NUMBERING POLICIES</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Kraaijenbrink explained the proposal
for an ad hoc group group to be charged with developing the objectives
and proposing structures for future policies in the area of numbering,
especially as required to meet global market needs and taking
into account the convergence of information technology services
and networks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Murai said that it is important to clarify
that the ad hoc group would not actually have any direct involvement
in address allocation and this would remain the duty of the ASO.
He noted that past experience and the nature of IP address space
require highly technical understanding and input.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Kraaijenbrink confirmed Mr. Murai's
understanding and said that an example of the type of concern
the ad hoc group might consider is to identify numbering issues
related to the interconnection of the IP networks with fixed and
mobile telecommunications systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Interim Chairman noted that the group
is intended to function similar to a study group and to identify
where there are gray areas or areas of potential conflict and
to refer them up to the technical groups to be addressed within
the appropriate structures or new structure as may be required.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Sims, legal counsel to ICANN, confirmed
that, consistent with the By-laws, the Supporting Organizations
have the primary responsibility for policy recommendations within
their areas and the ad hoc group is not a replacement for the
ASO.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In response to a question, Mr. Roberts noted
that, in consultation with Mr. Kraaijenbrink, he would be charged
with developing the structure of the ad hoc group and he intends
to convene a meeting of interested parties at the earliest opportunity
in light of demands on staff.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Messrs. Crew and Fitzsimmons requested a
business plan to accompany the group structure to know that it
is properly focused on relevant topics and who will be involved.
Mr. Roberts agreed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Murai affirmed the importance of the
address space and the need for the IAB to be an active participant
in the ad hoc group. He noted that his concern is architectural:
the address space is essential to everything else on the Internet,
as everything else sits on top of it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Initial Board unanimously approved the adoption of the following
resolution:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><A NAME="99.79"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [99.79] that
  the Interim President and CEO, working with Director Kraaijenbrink,
  is directed to establish an ad hoc group to be charged with developing
  the objectives and proposing structures for future policies in
  the area of numbering, especially as required to meet global
  market needs and taking into account the convergence of information
  technology services and networks. The group will include representatives
  of businesses, including telecom operators and Internet service
  providers and trade organizations, the ASO Council, the ICANN
  Board, and other legitimately interested parties. The group will
  present an interim report before the second ICANN public meeting
  in 2000. A final report from the ad hoc group will be presented
  to the ICANN Board prior to the Annual Meeting in 2000.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="NCDNHC"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">NON-COMMERCIAL DOMAIN
NAME HOLDERS CONSTITUENCY</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Roberts then reviewed the background
of the proposed resolution to provisionally recognize the Non-Commercial
Domain Name Holders Constituency on the same terms and conditions
as the other constituency groups of the DNSO and consistent with
the prior related action of the Initial Board.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Initial Board unanimously approved the adoption of the following
resolution:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><A NAME="99.80"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [99.80] that
  the Non-Commercial Domain Name Holders Constituency of the Domain
  Name Supporting Organization is provisionally recognized until
  the Annual Meeting of the Board in November, 1999, on the same
  basis and subject to the same conditions as set forth in Resolutions
  99.31 through 99.34.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="UDRP"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">UNIFORM DISPUTE RESOLUTION
POLICY</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Louis Touton, legal counsel to ICANN,
then reviewed the status of efforts to develop a uniform dispute
resolution policy, following public notice and comment and the
extensive discussions by interested parties which preceded the
presentation of the proposed resolution.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">He noted that a number of interested parties
had raised valid concerns which were reflected in the resolution.
He noted that it was the broad consensus of the General Assembly
of the DNSO that the mechanics of dispute resolution be put in
place. He said that a small drafting group would be convened to
assist the ICANN staff in preparing the implementation documents
so that they are ready for implementation within 45 days.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At the request of the Interim Chairman,
the proposed resolution was revised to include reference to the
need to define &quot;reverse domain name hijacking.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Initial Board unanimously approved the adoption of the following
resolutions:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, on April 30, 1999, the World Intellectual
  Property Organization (WIPO) presented a report with its recommendations
  to ICANN on, among other things, a uniform dispute resolution
  policy for domain name disputes; and</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, at its Berlin meeting the Board
  referred the dispute-resolution recommendations to the Domain
  Name Supporting Organization and encouraged the testbed registrars
  to develop a model dispute resolution policy for voluntary adoption;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, on August 3, 1999, the DNSO Names
  Council submitted to the Board five recommendations on a uniform
  dispute resolution policy as consensus positions;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, the testbed registrars, under
  the leadership of America Online and register.com, consulted
  among themselves and with post-testbed registrars and Network
  Solutions and proposed a Model Dispute Resolution Policy for
  Voluntary Adoption, which approximately twenty registrars have
  agreed to adopt; it is now</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="99.81"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [99.81] that
  the Board accepts the DNSO's recommendation that ICANN adopt
  a uniform dispute resolution policy for accredited registrars
  in the .com, .net, and .org top-level domains;</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="99.82"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.82]
  that the President is directed, with the assistance of ICANN
  staff and counsel, to prepare implementation documents for approval
  by the Board after public notice and comment, on a schedule that
  allows the policy to be put into place within 45 days.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="99.83"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.83]
  that the Board gives the following guidance as to the preparation
  of the implementation documents:</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <DIR>
    <P><A NAME="99.83-1"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">1. The registrars'
    Model Dispute Resolution Policy should be used as a starting
    point;</FONT>
    <P><A NAME="99.83-2"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">2. The President
    or his delegate should convene a small drafting committee including
    persons selected by him to express views and consider the interests
    of the registrar, non-commercial, individual, intellectual property,
    and business interests;</FONT>
    <P><A NAME="99.83-3"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">3. In addition to
    the factors mentioned in paragraph 171(2) of the WIPO report,
    the following should be considered in determining whether a domain
    name was registered in bad faith:</FONT>
    <DIR>
      <P><A NAME="99.83-3a"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">(a) Whether the
      domain name holder is making a legitimate noncommercial or fair
      use of the mark, without intent to misleadingly divert consumers
      for commercial gain or to tarnish the mark</FONT>
      <P><A NAME="99.83-3b"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">(b) Whether the
      domain name holder (including individuals, businesses, and other
      organizations) is commonly known by the domain name, even if
      the holder has acquired no trademark or service mark rights;
      and</FONT>
      <P><A NAME="99.83-3c"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">(c) Whether, in
      seeking payment for transfer of the domain name, the domain name
      holder has limited its request for payment to its out-of-pocket
      costs.</FONT>
    </DIR>
    <P><A NAME="99.83-4"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">4. There should be
    a general parity between the appeal rights of complainants and

    <P><A NAME="99.83-5"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">5. The dispute policy
    should seek to define and minimize reverse domain name hijacking;</FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><A NAME="99.84"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.84]
  that the President is authorized to provisionally approve dispute
  resolution providers under the uniform dispute resolution policy.
  From time to time, a list of provisionally approved providers
  should be compiled and provided to each accredited registrar
  to be incorporated into its policy. The DNSO is requested to
  recommend principles for a more formal dispute resolution provider
  accreditation program for consideration by the Board in 2000.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="99.85"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.85]
  that the Board requests WIPO to provide recommendations on the
  topics set forth in a list to be transmitted to WIPO by the President.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="InitialTermExtension"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">EXTENSION
OF TERM OF THE INITIAL AT-LARGE DIRECTORS</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Roberts reviewed the resolution to extend
the terms of the Initial At-Large Directors. He noted that, in
light of the fact that the process for selecting the elected At
Large Directors was still being developed, it was appropriate
to extend the term of the Initial Board members until their replacements
were in place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Initial Board unanimously approved the adoption of the following
resolutions:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><A NAME="99.86"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [99.86], that
  under in Article V, Section 1 of the Corporation's bylaws the
  term of each of the At Large Directors of the Initial Board is
  extended to expire on the sooner of (i) the seating of the At
  Large Director's successor selected pursuant to the process referred
  to in Article V, Section 4(iv) of the Bylaws and (ii) September
  30, 2000.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="AtLargeMembership"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">AT-LARGE
MEMBERSHIP</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Crew reviewed activity related to the
development of an At-Large membership and related legal issues.
He stated that, considering the legal effect of directly electing
Board members and the desirability of maintaining parity among
the Supporting Organizations and the At Large membership, it would
be desirable to create an At-Large membership structure which
would provide for the election of an At-Large Council similar
to that of the Supporting Organizations. The Council would have
a number of duties including representing the views of the At-Large
constituency. The Council would also select the At-Large members
of the Board of Directors. He observed that the Council must be
geographically diverse and reflect broad representation. He said
that it would be elected upon the determination that at least
5000 At-Large members had enrolled in ICANN. He also noted that
the At-Large Membership must be self-supporting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Crew noted that there are many details
to be addressed related to election procedures, confirmation of
residency and the like.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Initial Board discussed the size of
the Council and agreed that it was appropriate to provide for
up to 18 members with some elected by regional members and some
elected from among the global constituency and in such manner
as to assure proper geographic diversity and to assure that there
were enough individuals to carry out the work of the Council.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Kraaijenbrink noted that it may be helpful
to have 2 members from each of the five regions with each of the
two being from a different country in their region, with the remaining
8 elected globally.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Fitzsimmons stated that it is important
to assure that the process produces knowledgeable and capable
Council members with regional depth to support each other.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Sims noted that specific amendments
to the Bylaws might be necessary to implement the final structure
as recommended by the ICANN staff.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Crew observed that it might be prudent
to test a worldwide online election process through the election
of some part of a Council before attempting to elect the entire
Council. This would mean that a limited number of Council members
would initially elect some limited number of At-Large Board members.
Mr. Crew reported that he and Mr. Roberts had met with interested
individuals related to the formation of a Membership Advisory
Implementation Task Force and were pleased at the broad diversity
of the expressions of interest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Roberts emphasized the need for proper
funding for staff resources to support the development of the
At-Large Membership before any large-scale outreach to the worldwide
community occurs so as not to frustrate expectations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ms. Wilson noted that it might be easier
to identify resources for the initial election process than for
ongoing funding.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In response to a question, Mr. Crew said
that he did not foresee that participation on the Task Force would
disqualify someone from serving on the Council. However, he did
not anticipate that a person could be both a member of the Council
and a member of the Board of ICANN.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Sims said that, while this was the intention
of the Bylaws, it might be desirable to amend them to make clear
that a person could not simultaneously serve on the ICANN Board
and on a Supporting Organization or At Large Council.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ms. Wilson proposed that the resolution
restate the Board's action in Berlin which stated that the At-Large
Membership has the responsibility to find funding.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. McLaughlin suggested that the staff
would propose a policy related to the At-Large membership structure
for the Initial Board's consideration in November and would publish
it for public comment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Initial Board unanimously approved the adoption of the following
resolutions:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><A NAME="99.87"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [99.87] that
  the At-Large Directors should be selected by an At-Large Council,
  the members of which are directly elected by the at-large members
  of ICANN;</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="99.88"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.88]
  that the At-Large Council shall consist of a maximum of 18 members,
  selected pursuant to an election process to be developed by the
  President and approved by the Board that is consistent with the
  following principles:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><A NAME="99.88-1"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">1. The At-Large membership
    shall be geographically diverse, broadly representative of the

    5 defined geographic regions, with each regional Council member
    elected by the residents of his or her region. The remaining
    Council members (no more than eight) shall be elected globally
    by all ICANN At-Large members. A candidate for a regional At
    Large seat must be a citizen of a country located in that region.
    No two members of the At Large Council elected from the same
    region shall be citizens of the same country.</FONT></P>
    <P><A NAME="99.88-3"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">3. Election to the

    if consistent with the selection of at least some At Large Directors
    prior to July 1, 2000.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><A NAME="99.89"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.89]

  election procedures; and monitor and oversee the initial At Large
  Council elections to ensure that they are conducted openly and
  fairly.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="99.90"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.90]
  that, while the Board reiterates its determination that the At
  Large membership will ultimately be expected to fund its operations
  (including the election process), the President and staff are
  directed to seek to obtain the necessary funding to conduct the
  election of the initial At Large Council, and authorized, subject
  to the availability of adequate funds, to hire or retain sufficient
  staff support to administer the At Large membership program;
  support the At Large Council; develop and implement computer
  and software systems for membership records and online election
  processes; coordinate the outreach program; and other necessary
  and related tasks.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="99.91"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.91]
  that the President and staff are directed to prepare implementing
  bylaws, including a definition of the specific rights of members
  and the responsibilities and scope of the At Large Council, to
  be presented to the Board for its review and approval following
  public notice and comment.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ms. Wilson reviewed the Final Report of
the Advisory Committee on Independent Review, and stated that
the next step would be for the ICANN staff to prepare a final
written policy to implement the Committee's Final Report, to be
considered by the Board at its next meeting in November.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In response to a question, Ms. Wilson suggested
that the process for selecting the members of the contemplated
Independent Review Panel should be revisited and potentially revised
after the At-Large membership structure is fully functional.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Murai then reviewed the activity of
the Root Server System Advisory Committee relating to Y2K matters.
He noted that the root server operators have been working on these
matters since July 1998 and the Committee has authored, in co-operation
with a range of interested parties, a report which has been published
on the ICANN website.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Murai stated that the Committee has
investigated Y2K readiness issues related to the root server system
and has concluded that the Y2K event poses little threat to its
operations. He noted that no system is 100% perfect and that work
will continue to assure the best outcome.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Murai thanked Messrs. Conrad, Kato and
Manning for their efforts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Roberts noted that ICANN has no official
role in Y2K compliance but it is of concern to all the Internet
community and, therefore, it is appropriate to focus on these
matters.</FONT></P>

be made on a time-sensitive basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. McLaughlin then reviewed the tentative
meeting schedule for Board meetings through 2000. He noted that
