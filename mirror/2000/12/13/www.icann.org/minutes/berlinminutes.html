<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A meeting of the Board of Directors of the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (the &quot;Corporation&quot;)
was held at 8:45 a.m. local time at the Adlon Hotel in Berlin,
Germany, on May 27, 1999. All of the initial Directors of the
Corporation were present: Geraldine Capdeboscq, George H. Conrades,
Gregory L. Crew, Esther Dyson, Frank Fitzsimmons, Hans Kraaijenbrink,
Jun Murai, Michael Roberts, Eugenio Triana, and Linda Wilson.
Also present at the meeting were Joe Sims, Mike Weinberg, and
Louis Touton of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue; and Andrew McLaughlin,
Molly Shaffer Van Houweling, and Ann Marie Plubell of the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Molly Shaffer Van
Houweling acted as secretary for the meeting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The meeting was called to order by Esther
Dyson. Michael Roberts opened the meeting by reviewing the agenda.
<BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;</FONT><A NAME="TransitionStatus"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">TRANSITION
STATUS REPORT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Counsel gave a report on ICANN's transition
process under its Memorandum of Understanding with the U.S. Department
of Commerce and reported that the Corporation is approximately
halfway through its transition tasks. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;</FONT><A NAME="DNSORecognition"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">DOMAIN
NAME SUPPORTING ORGANIZATION CONSTITUENCY RECOGNITION</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Staff then summarized the proposals (and
related commentary) received for Domain Name Supporting Organization
(DNSO) Constituencies. Changes made in the proposals as a result
of organizational Constituency meetings held in Berlin on May
25 were noted, and in particular, that proposals for the Intellectual
Property and ISP and Connectivity Providers Constituencies had
been modified to broaden participation. Possible outstanding problems
with the Constituency proposals were highlighted, including: limited
participation in the organization process, uncertainty regarding
compliance with the geographic diversity requirements in the ICANN
Bylaws, and overly discretionary participation criteria. It was
noted that the various organizers of the Non-Commercial Domain
Name Holders Constituency had come close to reaching a compromise,
but that they had not yet settled on a plan setting out the process
for selection of Names Council members.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, on a related matter, staff reported
that ICANN had solicited public comments on the question of whether
&quot;initial DNSO Constituencies currently identified as 'ccTLD
registries' and 'gTLD registries' be re-categorized as 'open registries'
and 'closed registries,' identified according to whether the registry
is open to any registrant, worldwide ('open'), or is instead limited
to certain registrants based on geography, intended use, or other
criteria ('closed'),&quot; and that the response had been largely
negative; therefore, the staff did not recommend taking any action
on the matter at this time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Board discussed the possibility of provisional
recognition of all of the Constituencies except for the Non-Commercial
Domain Name Holders (based on proposals attached hereto as <A
HREF="http://www.icann.org/minutes/exhibita.htm">Exhibit A</A>)
for a limited period of time in which the Constituencies could
operate on an interim basis, while making improvements in their
structures. In particular, the Directors emphasized the importance
of conducting Constituency outreach to potential participants;
articulating clear statements of Constituency participation criteria;
solidifying specific plans for compliance with geographic representation
requirements; and conforming Constituency Names Council representative
voting and related plans to the provisional period timeline. The
Board also discussed possible solutions to the specific problems
regarding the gTLD Constituency, the Non-Commercial Domain Name
Holders Constituency, and the geographic diversity requirements
for Constituencies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Board unanimously approved the adoption of the following resolutions:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED (Resolution 99.31), that the following
Constituencies (as defined in Article VI-B of the Bylaws) are
provisionally recognized until the annual meeting of the Board
in 1999, to operate in accordance with the proposals received
by the Corporation and ordered attached to these minutes:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <UL>
    <UL>
      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">ccTLD registries</FONT>
      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Commercial and business entities</FONT>

      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Intellectual property</FONT>
      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">ISPs and connectivity providers</FONT>
      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Registrars</FONT>
    </UL>
  </UL>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.32), that
the President of the Corporation is directed to work with the
Constituencies to amend their proposals to address deficiencies
noted by the Board, which amended proposals must include a commitment
of the submitting Constituency to hold a new election of Names
Council representatives promptly following the approval by the
Board of such amended proposal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.33), that,
when such proposals are so amended, the Board should examine such
proposals to determine whether the deficiencies have been satisfactorily
addressed and whether to extend the recognition today made.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.34), that
the Names Council representatives chosen by the provisionally
recognized Constituencies shall constitute the provisional Names
Council, with all the powers set forth in the Bylaws other than
the selection of ICANN Directors (pursuant to Section 2(e) of
Article VI-B of the Bylaws), which selection powers will be deferred
until such time as the Board determines it has made sufficient
final recognitions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.35), that
the Board requests that the Constituency for gTLD registries agree,
for so long as Network Solutions is the only participant in such
Constituency, to select only one individual (rather than three)
to represent that Constituency on the provisional Names Council,
and the Board states that if such Constituency does not agree
to make only one such selection, the Board will amend the Bylaws
to effectuate such goal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.36), that
the phrase &quot;except with the consent of the Board&quot; shall
be inserted after the twenty-first word of Section 3(c) of Article
VI-B of the Bylaws.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.37), that
the Board considers geographic diversity to be an important requirement
that should be met promptly, but consents to waiver of the Names
Council geographic diversity requirement of Article VI-B(3)(c)
of the Bylaws, for the period of provisional recognition only.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.38), the
Board determines that no proposal to create a non-commercial domain
name holders Constituency has yet been submitted that is appropriate
for recognition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.39), with
the recognition that the interests represented by a non-commercial
domain name holders Constituency should be involved as early as
possible in the DNSO organization process, the Board urges that
the organizers of this Constituency should submit a consensus
application for provisional recognition as soon as possible, so
that the issue of recognition can be reconsidered by the Board
no later than an anticipated meeting during the week of June 21
so that representatives of this Constituency can join the provisional
Names Council.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Directors then discussed whether an
additional Constituency for individual domain name holders should
be added to the initial seven Constituencies called for in the
ICANN Bylaws--an addition supported by some commentators (including
some remote, online participants) at the May 26 public meeting.
Some Directors expressed concern that some individual domain name
holders may not be adequately represented by the Initial Constituencies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Board noted that ICANN had announced
that no applications for additional constituencies would be considered
until the original constituencies it had established in Singapore
were constituted. There was also general consensus that whether
a DNSO constituency for individuals should be established could
be affected by how the At-Large membership was structured and
operated. Given this, the Board decided to defer consideration
of this proposal until a later date. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;</FONT><A NAME="Employment"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">EMPLOYMENT
MATTERS</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Board next discussed the possibility
of engaging a recruiter to search for a permanent CEO, and other
staffing issues. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;</FONT><A NAME="BylawChanges"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">BYLAW
CHANGES REGARDING GOVERNMENTAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At this point Paul Twomey, Chair of the
Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), joined the meeting and
gave a presentation requesting that the ICANN Board amend its
Bylaws to ensure that the Membership definitions for the GAC in
the Bylaws align with the membership definitions in the GAC's
adopted Operating Principles. In particular, he proposed that
the membership definition be altered to permit GAC participation
by &quot;Distinct Economies as recognized in international fora,&quot;
and to specify that each GAC Member shall appoint as its accredited
representative to the Committee someone who holds a formal official
position with the Member's public administration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Subsequently, upon motion duly made and
seconded, the Board unanimously approved the adoption of the following
resolution&nbsp; (Director Capdeboscq being absent):</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS the Board has received the Operating
Principles adopted by the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC);
and</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS the GAC has requested that the Board
conform the applicable Bylaws to the membership criteria established
in the Operating Principles;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">BE IT RESOLVED (Resolution 99.40) that Article
VII, Sec. 3(a) of the Bylaws be amended to replace the third sentence
with the following:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;Membership of the Governmental Advisory
Committee shall be open to all national governments. Membership
shall also be open to Distinct Economies as recognized in international
fora, and multinational governmental organizations and treaty
organizations, on the invitation of the Governmental Advisory
Committee through its Chair, or on invitation of the ICANN Board.
Members of the Governmental Advisory Committee shall appoint one
accredited representative to the Committee. The accredited representative
of a Member must hold a formal official position with the Member's
public administration. The term &quot;official&quot; includes
a holder of an elected governmental office, or a person who is
employed by such government, public authority or multinational
governmental or treaty organization and whose primary function
with such government, public authority or organization is to develop
or influence governmental or public policies.&quot; <BR>
&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A petition submitted to the Board by the
International Association of Top Level Domains was then discussed.
Dr. Twomey described GAC discussions on the issues raised by the
petition and responded to questions regarding these issues.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Dr. Twomey then departed.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="WIPORecommendations"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">WORLD
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ORGANIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Staff summarized the World Intellectual
Property Organization's &quot;Final Report of the WIPO Internet
Domain Name Process&quot; and the comments that ICANN received
on its recommendations. (In advance of the meeting the Directors
had an opportunity to consider a full summary of the comments
received on the WIPO recommendations, attached as <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/minutes/wipo_comments.htm">Exhibit
B</A> hereto.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The report was summarized as consisting
of three parts: one part recommends registrar practices (such
as contact information requirements and pre-payment) to forestall
intellectual property disputes; one part recommends a uniform
administrative procedure for dispute resolution regarding &quot;abusive
registration&quot; of domain names; and one part proposes prerequisites
for moving forward with new gTLDs--including a proposed mechanism
for excluding registration in new gTLDs of &quot;globally famous
or well-known&quot; marks by non-mark owners. Staff noted that
a large group of commentators took the position that ICANN should
not act on any part of the report, but should instead refer it
to the DNSO; another significant group of commentators urged ICANN
to act quickly and to adopt as many of the recommendations as
possible right away.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The staff noted that ICANN's Registrar Accreditation
Agreement already requires most of the registrar practices called
for in the first part of the WIPO report. It was also noted that
the Agreement calls for registrars to adopt dispute resolution
policies, and that accredited registrars are already working together
to do so. Counsel noted that Network Solutions' registry-registrar
contract also calls for registrars to have dispute resolution
policies in place, and that registrars are anxious to have guidance
on a uniform policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Staff noted that although many commentators
expressed support for the concept of a uniform dispute resolution
policy, some raised questions about the specific mechanism proposed
by WIPO. In particular, concern has been raised about whether
domain name holders who lost in the proposed administrative proceeding
would have any effective way to challenge the outcome in court.
The Directors discussed that the scope of the mechanism recommended
by WIPO may be insufficient for registrars, as ICANN's agreement
with accredited registrars calls for them to adopt a dispute resolution
policy covering SLD-related disputes, not only abusive registrations.
The consensus among the Directors was that the Board supported
the general concept of uniform dispute resolution for gTLD registrars,
but that the details should be referred for further study by the
DNSO--under an expedited time-line designed to facilitate adoption
of uniform policies by registrars as soon as possible.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Staff noted that the WIPO recommendations
regarding an exclusion mechanism for &quot;globally famous or
well-known&quot; marks were the most controversial--with several
commentators arguing that they would provide mark owners with
rights beyond those granted under trademark law. The consensus
among the Directors was that this issue also should be considered
further by the DNSO.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Board then unanimously approved the adoption of the following
resolutions (Director Capdeboscq being absent):</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, in the White Paper the U.S. Government
called on the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
to develop recommendations regarding trademark disputes concerning
domain names;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, on April 30, 1999, WIPO submitted
a report to the ICANN Board containing numerous recommendations
that resulted from an extensive consultative process;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, the first ICANN-accredited registrars
(testbed registrars), are preparing to introduce competition in
the provision of domain registration services and accordingly
are required soon to implement dispute resolution policies;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED (Resolution 99.41), the ICANN Board
commends the WIPO on its report, which the ICANN Board finds represents
a substantial and positive contribution to the analysis and discussion
of issues concerning the relationship between the domain-name
system and intellectual property rights;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.42), the
ICANN Board notes that most of the recommendations in Chapter
2 of the WIPO report relating to best practices for registrars
are closely similar to many of the elements of the Statement of
Registrar Accreditation Policy adopted by the Board on March 4,
1999 and that the provisions of that policy are scheduled for
review by the Board in the first half of 2000;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.43), the
ICANN Board endorses the principle that a uniform dispute resolution
policy should be adopted for Registrars in the .com, .net, and
.org Top-Level Domains (TLDs);</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.44), the
ICANN Board encourages the testbed registrars to work together
to formulate a model dispute resolution policy for voluntary adoption
and directs the President to provide information and similar assistance
to the testbed registrars in this regard;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.45), the
ICANN Board refers the recommendations in Chapter 3 of the WIPO
report (with associated annexes) to the ICANN Domain Name Supporting
Organization (DNSO) for recommendations the DNSO</FONT><A NAME="QuickMark"></A><FONT
 FACE="Arial">, to be submitted to the ICANN Board by July 31,
1999;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.46), the
ICANN Board requests that by July 31, 1999 the DNSO submit to
the Board any other recommendations the DNSO may have concerning
a uniform dispute resolution policy for registrars in the .com,
.net, and .org TLDs;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.47), the
ICANN Board requests all persons desiring to make written comments
concerning a uniform dispute resolution policy for registrars
in the .com, .net, and .org TLDs to submit those comments by August
20, 1999, in advance of the Board s meeting scheduled for August
24-26, 1999 in Santiago, at which time Board action on such a
policy is hereby scheduled; and</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.48), the
ICANN Board refers the recommendations in Chapters 4 and 5 (with
associated annexes) of the WIPO report to the ICANN DNSO for recommendations
on the topics of those chapters, to be submitted to the ICANN
Board at the earliest practicable time after the Board s meeting
scheduled for August 24-26, 1999 in Santiago. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="AtLargeMembership"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">AT-LARGE
MEMBERSHIP STRUCTURE</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Board then discussed the Membership
Advisory Committee's &quot;Commentary on the Principles of the
At-large Membership,&quot; (attached as <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/minutes/exhibitc.htm">Exhibit
C</A> hereto) which was finalized by the Committee members who
met in Berlin on May 25. There was a comprehensive discussion
of the Commentary, which touched on all aspects of the set of
principles advanced. In particular, there was considerable discussion
about the size of membership that was necessary or desirable to
make the At-Large electorate effective, workable, and representative,
and the appropriateness of charging fees to pay for the (likely
quite costly) membership and election process, and the need to
have a process that could be adjusted if it proved to be unworkable.
The consensus of the Board was that it was inappropriate for the
costs of the process to be borne by domain name holders or other
ICANN constituents that did not participate in the At-Large membership
or elections, but there was also concern that membership fees
that were too high might have the practical effect of disenfranchising
some potential members. The Board directed the staff and counsel
to analyze the MAC principles in the light of its discussion,
and report back prior to the Santiago meeting, with the goal of
moving forward with the creation of an At-Large Membership structure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Following extensive discussion, and upon
motion duly made and seconded, the Board unanimously approved
the adoption of the following resolutions (Director Capdeboscq
being absent):</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, the Board has received and reviewed
the Commentary on the Principles of the At-Large Membership from
the Membership Advisory Committee;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, the Board recognizes the significant
contribution to the discussion and evaluation of the process of
establishing the ICANN At-Large Membership made by the MAC, expresses
its deep appreciation for the personal sacrifices that effort
required, and accepts the retirement of the current members of
the MAC;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, the Board has also considered the
public comments submitted via the Internet and at the Singapore
and Berlin open meetings;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, the Board reaffirms its intention
to establish, as soon as practicable, a system that permits individuals
to select geographically diverse At-Large Directors, but also
recognizes that this effort, given the unique context of a new
form of global consensus organization with responsibility for
oversight of an important global resource, is likely to be both
administratively complex and expensive (especially in relation
to ICANN s anticipated budget);</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS the Board believes that the cost
of implementing an At-Large membership and election process should
primarily be borne by that membership;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, the Board also reaffirms its intention
to implement an At-Large election process that supports the principal
responsibility of ICANN, which is to preserve the operational
stability of the Internet, and thus to implement any such process
over a transitional period that will permit any adjustments to
the process determined to be necessary to meet this commitment;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">NOW THEREFORE, the Board directs staff to
review the MAC Commentary and report back to the Board before
the Santiago meeting on the administrative requirements, likely
cost, and logistical details of an election process responsive
to the MAC Commentary.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">AND FURTHER, the Board directs counsel to
report to it before the Santiago meeting on the legal implications
of an election process responsive to the MAC commentary.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">AND FURTHER, the Board directs staff to
recommend to the Board a process for repopulating the MAC, so
that it can advise the Board on promotion and encouragement of
membership and solicitation of sponsorship for outreach programs.
<BR>
&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Following the meeting, Director Geraldine
Capdeboscq asked that her agreement with the resolutions regarding
membership be noted in the minutes. <BR>
&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="IRACRecommendations"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">INDEPENDENT
REVIEW ADVISORY COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Staff then reported on the Interim Report
and Draft Principles of the Advisory Committee on Independent
Review (attached as <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/minutes/exhibitd.htm">Exhibit
D</A> hereto), an Addendum to the Interim Report (attached as
<A HREF="http://www.icann.org/minutes/exhibite.htm">Exhibit E</A>
hereto) and public commentary received. The key issue is the power
of the independent review panel called for in the recommendation.
Since no Committee consensus position could be reached, the Committee
proposed three options. In addition to the power to (i) declare
whether an action or inaction of the ICANN Board was contrary
to the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation and/or Bylaws,
(ii) request additional written submissions from the claimant,
the Board, the Supporting Organizations, or from other parties,
and (iii) recommend that the ICANN Board stay any action or decision
until such time as the Board reviews and acts upon the opinions
of the IRP, the panel might be empowered to: (a) immediately stay
enforcement or execution of the contested decision of the Board;
(b) stay enforcement or execution of the contested decision of
the Board only if the Board has failed to act on the IRP's determination
within 14 days; or (c) require the Board to act on the IRP's determination
at its next meeting or within 30 days, whichever is sooner.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Board unanimously approved&nbsp; the adoption of the following
resolutions (Directors Wilson and Capdeboscq being absent):</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS the Board of Directors has received
and considered the Interim Report and Draft Principles submitted
by the Advisory Committee on Independent Review on May 7, 1999,
along with the Addendum to the Interim Report submitted on May
26, 1999; and</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS the Board has reviewed and considered
the public comments submitted via the Internet and at the Berlin
open meeting;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">BE IT RESOLVED (Resolution 99.49) that the
Board (1) accepts the Draft Principles, as amended by the Addendum;
(2) states its preference for option (c) to Draft Principle 9
set forth in the Addendum; and (3) requests that the Advisory
Committee on Independent Review complete and submit its final
report and recommendations by August 10, 1999; and</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED (Resolution 99.50)
that the Board thanks the Advisory Committee on Independent Review
for its hard and productive work so far. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;</FONT><A NAME="DNSRootServer"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">DNS
ROOT SERVER ISSUES</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Board then received a briefing on the
status of the Root Server System Advisory Committee's activities,
the proposed formation by the IETF of a Domain Name Server Operations
working group, and the need for better coordinated and defined
mechanisms for fulfilling the Corporation's obligations concerning
the root server system under its November 25, 1998 Memorandum
of Understanding/Joint Project Agreement.&nbsp; Counsel reported
on the status of discussions with the U.S. Department of Commerce
regarding contractual mechanisms for establishment of a cooperative
research project intended to develop, implement, and test improvements
to the management of the root server system.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Board unanimously approved the adoption of the following resolutions:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, the Corporation's staff and counsel
have negotiated with the U.S. Government a Cooperative Research
and Development Agreement (CRADA) establishing a joint research
and development project concerning Improvements to Management
of the Internet Root Server System to be conducted by the Corporation,
the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
and the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA);</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, a copy of the CRADA has been provided
to the Board;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED (Resolution 99.51), the Corporation
accepts the terms of the CRADA and directs the President to sign
it on behalf of the Corporation with such changes as the President
may determine;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED (Resolution 99.52), the President
is directed to prepare appropriate work plans and other proposals
to NIST and NTIA detailing the Corporation's proposed activities
under the CRADA; and</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED (Resolution 99.53), the President
is authorized to expend funds of the Corporation to purchase equipment
and software necessary to perform the activities contemplated
under the project. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;</FONT><A NAME="PSO"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">PROTOCOL
SUPPORTING ORGANIZATION</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Staff described a proposal for the Protocol
Supporting Organization (PSO) submitted on behalf of the IETF
POISSON working group (attached hereto as <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/minutes/exhibitf.htm">Exhibit

ITU, ETSI, W3C, and others have expressed support for the proposal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Staff explained that the proposal contemplates
a Memorandum of Understanding between standards organizations
participating in the PSO and ICANN, and recommended that the President
be directed to draft bylaws provisions formally establishing the
PSO, to be considered for approval by the Board.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Board unanimously approved&nbsp; the adoption of the following
resolution (Directors Wilson and Capdeboscq being absent):</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS the Board of Directors has received
the proposal for a Protocol Supporting Organization submitted
on April 23, 1999; and</FONT></P>
