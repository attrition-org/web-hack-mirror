      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Whereas, the Names Council of the DNSO
      <A HREF="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/notes/19990625.NCsj-admin.html">created
      working groups B and C</A> to study and report on these topics
      in July 1999;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Whereas, those working groups have discussed
      these topics for over eight months;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Whereas, on March 8, 2000, the Names Council
      requested that reports from these working groups be submitted
      to it for comment within ten days and declared its intention
      to submit the reports for public comment for a period of four

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">1. The Board adopted <A HREF="minutes-26aug99.htm#99.87">resolutions

        on August 26,1999 directing the staff to prepare amended Bylaws,
        and <A HREF="consent-29oct99.htm#99.116">resolution 99.116</A>
        on October 29,1999, adopting <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-29oct99.htm">amended
        Bylaws</A>, that established, in <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-29oct99.htm#II">Article
        II</A>, an At Large membership and procedures for the selection
        of At Large Directors; and</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">2. The Board has received a significant
        amount of input from the Internet community relating to both
        the practical and conceptual bases underlying new Article II
        as adopted; and</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">3. The Board has observed that there remains,
        despite considerable efforts by the Board, ICANN staff, and other
        entities and individuals, and the limited technical mission of
        ICANN, a considerable diversity of views concerning the purpose
        of and rationale for the At Large membership and Council, and
        the advisability of the various electoral structures and procedures
        now set forth in Article II; and</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">4. The Board has observed that these widely
        divergent views have the effect of creating fundamentally different
        perspectives about the expected or desired results of the continuation
        of the At Large processes now underway; and</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">5. As a result, the Board has concluded
        that the concept and execution of the At Large membership requires
        careful and thorough reconsideration.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Whereas:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">1. The Board believes that, notwithstanding
        this conclusion, it is important that the various stakeholders
        that do not or cannot easily participate in the ICANN process
        through the Supporting Organizations have a voice in the development
        of ICANN policy; and</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">2. The Board believes that such opportunity
        should not await the results of that reconsideration;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">3. The Board believes that any solution
        to this problem pending the outcome of that reconsideration should
        ensure that, as is the case with the Directors selected by any
        single Supporting Organization, the At Large Directors should
        not be able to by themselves acting in the aggregate control
        the actions of the Board; and</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">4. The Board believes that it can accomplish
        all these objectives with the following set of actions.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Therefore it is resolved that the staff
      is directed to draft and present to the Board for its review
      and subsequent posting for public comment prior to adoption proposed
      amendments to Article II of the Bylaws and other resolutions
      that accomplish the following objectives:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">1. Establish a deadline for the initial
        selection of five (5) At Large Directors (one each representing
        each ICANN region) by a direct ballot of qualified ICANN members
        in each region by no later than November 1, 2000 to serve a term
        to expire at the conclusion of the Annual Meeting of the Corporation
        in 2002;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">2. Extend the terms of four (4) of the
        Initial At Large Directors, identities to be determined on the
        basis of willingness, geographic, and other factors, to expire
        at the conclusion of the Annual Meeting of the Corporation in
        2001, and extend the terms of the other five (5) Initial At Large
        Directors to expire at the conclusion of the annual meeting in
        2000;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">3. Establish a Nominating Committee consisting
        of members appointed by the Board to accept recommendations and
        nominations from the Internet community as a whole, and to nominate
        five or more candidates for consideration by the At Large membership
        for selection to the ICANN Board;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">4. Establish a petition process for additional
        nominations from the At Large membership that meet certain minimum
        qualifying criteria; and</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">5. Initiate a comprehensive study of the
        concept, structure, and processes relating to the At Large membership,
        on the following schedule:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">a. The study to begin promptly following
          the selection of the five At Large Directors (to take place no
          later than 11/1/00), with such initial design as is feasible
          to be done prior to that time;</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">b. Results of the study to be presented
          to the Board no later than the second ICANN quarterly meeting
          in 2001;</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">c. The ICANN Board to consider the results
          of the study, and propose for public comment whatever actions
          it deems appropriate as a result on a schedule that would permit
          taking final actions no later than the Annual Meeting of the
          Corporation in 2001; and</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">d. Implementation of any actions taken
          so that any subsequent At Large selections can take place on
          a schedule that would allow any new At Large Directors to be
          seated by the conclusion of the ICANN Annual Meeting in 2002;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">6. Extend an open invitation to organizations
        worldwide to assist in the comprehensive study; and</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">7. Suspend those provisions of Article
        II of the Bylaws that deal with the structure and process of
        the selection of At Large Directors pending the completion of
        the study referenced above and any subsequent actions by the
        Board.</FONT></P>
