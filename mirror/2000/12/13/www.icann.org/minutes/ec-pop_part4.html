<P><BR>
<P>Christopher Wilkinson: The . . . Where additional adjustments are necessary
to . . . for the consensus to become operational. I do not favor a recursive
debate, and I think the public authorities, starting here, and I hope that
my counterparts in the United States recognize the same responsibility.
Do have a responsibility vis-&agrave;-vis their authorities and their members
to be able to tell the difference between a real consensus that can be
achieved, and an argument where at least half of the argument seems to
be about avoiding a consensus. That is a very different situation, and
it has to be appreciated. But on the other aspects of your question, I
would refer to the members of the board. And then I agree with the chairman
that we should return the chair to Madam Dyson and continue the final session.
<P>Kenneth Neil Cukier: There will be a press conference at 5:30.
<P>[??]: Okay. Still, I don't know if you want to reply now or to open
the final session.
<P>Esther Dyson: I'd like to reply to this. ___________________ brief .
. .
<P>[??]: I'm sure _______________________ a good debate for the final session.
But it is your responsibility.
<P>Esther Dyson: _________________ if you just want to say what you want
to say, and I'll deal with this.
<P>[??]: Only ___________________. Of course, we are in the process to
have a harmonization as well of the different use from the different public
entities affecting ICANN from. And that's true. That's true that we have
a more clear recognition. It is necessary to this language from the European
countries and the European stakeholders. They're from the American guans[??]
up to now. That this is a clear situation. And I think that a meeting like
that, a conference like that, all the process, is a very important help.
It is a very important support to convince to other countries, particularly
the United States, that Europe is an important part in this process. And
we have the support from the European countries, the European Internet,
the stakeholders. This aspect, this parameter, cannot be ignored at all.
That is clear. And that is the position we have. Another different thing
is the ICANN board must be a board. It must be a board working on the rule
of super majority and the rule of consensus. We are working this way. And
thanks to working in this way, with the help of some people like Christopher,
we arrive for _______________ to introduce, in the last week, significant
amendments, coming not only from the most _______________, coming not only
from our American partners. Coming from the European Partnership, from
the European Commission. Some of these amendments, in my view, are fundamental
for the purpose of this _______________. The purpose of how to interact
public policies with the interests of the private stakeholders of Internet.
<P>Of course, we are working on the ways of the benefitter approach of
everybody. And we have very much confidence in that we are in the right
track to have this recognition that this absolutely fundamental for continues
working on. And I think that the spirit of the European parts, the spirit
of these meetings is a tremendous support for getting this. And I am sure
that having a chairperson like Esther, the input for this meeting will
be very important for this to arrive to this point. Thank you very much.
<P>Esther Dyson: Yeh, Eric, I want to respond to that. And let me first
give you a somewhat personal response. I know this is the point at which
we should all start holding hands and singing, but I personally feel somewhat
insulted at the notion that this is a war between American interests and
European interests. And I do not feel that I represent America. Yes, I'm
American, but I do not represent the American government. I don't represent
the American point of view. I take great offense when the American Congress
starts complaining that we're handing over American property to foreign
interests. But in the same way, I encourage you to see yourself not as
a European citizen, but as a world citizen. And that is our goal. It's
not to balance European interests and American interests, but it really
is to look at the various interests of the Internet stakeholders, most
of which do not operate per country, and to try and balance those. And
so we genuinely are trying to do this. It's not easy, and we have lots
of different groups, all of whom turn themselves into interest groups,
rather than considering the system as a whole. And that's what we are most
trying to do.
<P>I secondly just want to say please, the U.S. government did not simply
read the <I>New York Times</I> article and call us up and tell us what
to do. It was somewhat different. And these were decisions of the board
as a whole. In the future, we will, indeed, be publishing roll call votes
on important issues. But we did get together as a board, amazingly enough,
all 10 of us, on the telephone, and argue over these issues.
<P>On the issue of privacy, I've thought a lot about this one too. And
it seems to me, individual citizens should have a great deal of privacy.
But when you decide to sit on a board like this, and you make a certain
amount of sacrifice of your time, you also sacrifice some of your privacy.
You are, no longer, simply an individual citizen. You are directly involved
in responsibility for systems, whether or not they're assets, but for systems
and functions in which the public-at-large has a genuine interest. And,
therefore, I think you have a responsibility to disclose a little more
than you might have to as a private citizen. And this is something that
we all, individually as board members, agreed to take on. So having said
that, I can shortly open the last session in a much more conciliatory way.
<P>[??]: So according to your words, it isn't a closed decision on public
policy interest, and I give the floor back to Esther for the final _____________.
Thank you.
<P>[??]: First of all, could all the moderators and speakers who are still
in the room, come to the table so . . . according to available seats, so
that . . .?
<P>Esther Dyson: Well, I'm not sure what we want to do in this final session,
other than hear remaining questions and points of view that for some reason
were not sufficiently aired earlier. And I will use the chairman's prerogative
to make sure that they are aired somewhat briefly. But I'd like to start
the conclusion, first of all, by thanking Christopher Wilkinson for hosting
us in the first place. All of you here, those of you still here, for coming
to participate and share your points of view, and educate us. I want to
assure you that in addition to the board members sitting here, the other
board members will be getting the transcript and will also be getting a
report from those of us who are here, of what happened and what your concerns
are.
<P>As you can tell, we're going through very much of an education process.
We were selected, specifically, not to have too much history, so that we
could have open minds. Unfortunately, some of us may be considered to have
empty minds in this context, and we're trying to fill them as rapidly as
we can.
<P>A second thing that is worth note is that the traditional system by
which the Internet was governed had a lot of trust from its stakeholders.
It grew up organically. Nobody noticed it really when it began, other than
its users. And so it gained legitimacy by working and being the place where
people went to get names and addresses and protocols, and everything worked
fine. We are now heading to a stage where certain parts of our past have
become a burden. One part of that is the Americanness of it. Another is
the fact that while it worked very well, it wasn't very explicit. And there
weren't, other than the protocols themselves, there weren't a lot of procedures
and policies for resolving disputes. A lot of things were left unanswered
or handled in a very ad hoc manner. And we're living with some of that
past right now. So we, as a new board, as the initial board, have come
in without legitimacy, with some authority, whatever authority you think
the U.S. government had in the first place, and a challenge to win both
trust and legitimacy over the next couple of years by our actions, by the
transparency of our decisions, and, frankly, the quality of our decisions.
If they're transparent and stupid, that isn't going to get us very far.
We understand that, and we understand the challenges that face us. And
that's one reason, quite apart from our bylaws, and all the requirements
for transparency, that we're here. We need good advice from people who
have thought about these issues. Some of the arguments, as Bob Shaw said,
you've done all the work for us. But we need to see what it is you've done.
We need to pick the arrows out of your backs and try and resolve some of
these issues with all the light you can shine on them, and all the light
you are shining on us. So we hope that in the space of 2 years, we can
do that well and credibly, and create an organization and a set of policies
and procedures that the permanent board will take over and use to evolve
in the future as the Internet, itself, evolves.
<P>So again, I want to thank everybody here, our very patient board members,
and everyone on this panel, and open it up. It's 5 o'clock, but those of
you who wish to stay, we're . . . I think most of us are happy to stand
here and answer questions.
<P>Daniel Karrenberg: Just to be on the record and be perfectly clear,
Daniel Karrenberg, RIPE-NCC. The RIPE-NCC and its membership, which is
an international organization with members from more than 80 countries,
has participated constructively in the development of the current ICANN
structure. And we have publicly welcomed Version 5 of the bylaws, and would
like to proceed on this basis. However, I had some discussions with my
board and some of the members today, and we are concerned about the changes
made to Article 6, Section 1.F, which basically changes the voting procedures
and . . . about policy proposals, voting procedures of the board, to say
that no recommendation of the supporting organizations can be adopted unless
the board's in favor of adoption would be sufficient for adoption by the
board without taking a count of either the directors nominated or for election
by that supporting organization or their votes.
<P>It will be . . . Given the history of this process, during which the
influence of the supporting organization has been consistently diluted,
this may just go one step too far. It will be very difficult to sell this
to our supporting organization or to our membership basically, especially
since there's a perception. And I note the word perception here, that this
was put into the bylaws based on comments by very few vociferous people.
And the reference to newspaper articles here comes also to mind of the
members that I have spoken to. So I would ask the board to either reconsider
this, or help us, and help us forcefully to counter these perceptions and
to sell it to our membership.
<P>Erik Huizer: I'd like to second that from the IETF perspective. I haven't
been able to talk about this with the IAB and the IETF yet, but I've had
a couple of e-mails about it by now. If you look at the way it's phrased
now, that means that the 9 at-large members can vote against any proposal
from any SO. And since we haven't got a clear structure yet for 9 at-large
members, which makes it very difficult to put some trust in that just to
say it will be filled in __________________. It's very difficult at this
point in time to put some trust in that. I'm very curious as to how I need
to sell this to the IETF, that they are not allowed to vote on their own
proposals.
<P>Esther Dyson: To some extent, we hope to relieve you of that burden
because I think it's . . . Hans is planning to come to IETF, right? And
so will I and Mike Roberts. And we will be there as we are here, to talk
to you, listen to you, try and persuade you that . . . I mean, you can
take a conspiratorial point of view and say that the at-large members have
some vested interest in defeating your proposals. And they don't. We all
have a common interest in the Internet continuing to work stably. IETF
and the address people, in particular, . . . There's less political reason
. . . There's no reason to try and foil you. But I do think it's legitimate
that you should be able to persuade a majority of the board without yourselves,
of the validity of whatever proposal exists. And so this was not a plot
by the Boston Working Group. It was, I believe, a proper check and balance.
<P>Erik Huizer: I think the first issue works both ways.
<P>[??]: Maybe I can comment on this issue. I believe it's important to
note that the changes which were made to the bylaws last Saturday, and
which were sent to the Department of Commerce last Monday, were a unanimous
vote of all initial board members. So these changes are carried. And I
believe that you should consider these changes all in one. It is a set
of improvements after serious consideration by the members of the board.
You should also not go to the legal speak in the bylaws itself, but you
should also read the transmittal letter to the Department of Commerce signed
by Esther, and you should probably read and you'll find it all at www.ICANN.org.
The press release, it will be available outside, what the intention of
these changes are. And, of course, reading the legal text of bylaws, you
can always dream up the situations which you may not wish or like. But
may I give this in the consideration, that decisions and policy decisions
of proposals by the supporting organizations are very important decisions
for the Internet community. And we have discussed, also, that these decisions
would merit a two-thirds majority. And if you start counting the number
of votes, the situation we have written down now in the bylaws is more
or less equal to a two-thirds majority. You need quite a number of the,
let's say, representatives on the board, to carry a proposal. And I do
know that whatever you decide, you will always meet opposition. We haven't
gone to that through our journey around the world, and probably we will
again when we travel further. I feel confident that the decision which
has been laid now in the bylaws is a good one to start from. And as Esther
keeps reminding us, this is only one moment in time, and it will evolve
in the future when the supporting organizations get their place and the
at-large membership will be defined and board members from the at-large
membership will be chosen. Thank you.
<P>[??]: I'd just like to come back and comment from the perspective of
. . . The ICC certainly discussed this in business issues and had made
several submissions seeking stronger voting, higher voting, super majorities.
So in principle, I think we would feel this is a sensible move and would
support ICANN on that. Because also thinking about it, I think it does
believe . . . It does, actually, safeguard against the issue of capture.
And it removes concerns. You can't claim that that SO is captured if it
hasn't swung the vote with it. So I think that that's actually quite a
valuable safeguard, looking at it on the face of it.
<P>Roberto Gaetano: Thank you. Roberto Gaetano from ETSI. Also a member
of CORE. I think I can pretty well live with a new set of bylaws as long
as we can make sure that this is . . . the intention was to get to a final
package where we could accept certain modification, even some for which
we were not completely in agreement. I'm talking about the EC-POP group,
because I personally share the concern expressed by Daniel Karrenberg.
But I accept, also, the principle that at a certain point, you need to
make a negotiation and then get to a final set. And you need to make also
some concessions. So as long as this is the final set, and this will get
the ICANN board to be finally recognized and empowered by the NTIA, and
finally we can turn the page and get into business, okay. I can make the
effort and swallow the parts that I don't like. But if this is another
chapter of this absurd situation in which we slide sideways from a set
that was the fifth set of bylaws where we had overwhelming consensus all
over the world with the exception of a very small minority, and if we continue
to slide sideways towards the position of the Boston Working Group and
the ORSC, I think that this support to the new set of bylaws will start
becoming slimmer. So I think that . . . Trying to summarize, I think that
it is okay, as long as it is the final step and the final setup. But I
don't think that the EC-POP and the other people that have constituted
the majority of their[??] support to ICANN starting from Version 3 and
then Version 5, will be able to swallow some other modification that's
maybe down the road. Thank you.
<P>Esther Dyson: All I can say is, stand by. We're hoping to assuage those
concerns eminently, but we haven't yet got word. Believe me. The moment
we know, we'll tell you. Did you have a comment, Chris?
<P>Christopher Wilkinson: No.
<P>Esther Dyson: There was a question over here.
<P>Ivan Pope: Ivan Pope. Net Names, again. I'm just going to be a little
bit obsessive here and go back to the 11th Amendment to the ___________________
Agreement. I know that this is very interesting about the bylaws. And I
know that ICANN are gonna merge them. But it's very important to me that
there's some real things going on in the real world, seeing as I've come
here today to ICANN and not to talk to the EU or the other people who've
moderated groups. I just want to obsess slightly on one specific question
of ICANN. Assuming that ICANN is NEWCO, as referred to in the 11th Amendment,
it says that on December the 1st, NEWCO is supposed to designate 10 individuals
to make up a technical advisory group to look at the functionalist[??]
interface specification for the shared registration system that NSI put
together. That's about 6 days away in my estimation. I'd like to ask NEWCO,
aka ICANN, whether they have those 10 people designated, when they intend
to release a list of those 10 people, and if not, what they think is gonna
happen next. This is very very important from a business perspective. And
that's my perspective. Thank you.
<P>Esther Dyson: Assuming it happens, the moment we were to become NEWCO,
we would have to start dealing with that. Unfortunately, I think probably
December 1st is unrealistic. But we are aware of this particular deadline
that doesn't yet apply to us. And we're gonna try and do things like that
as rapidly as possible.
<P>[??]: Could I _______________ as a _______________, whether you have
an expected time frame to become NEWCO, or whether it's just going to drift
towards the end of the year and beyond. Because this is now very seriously
affecting a lot of planning that needs to go on in the real world. Thank
you.
<P>Esther Dyson: Patrick, do we have any news?
<P>Patrick Worms: Not yet.
<P>Esther Dyson: Not yet. Okay. Imminently. As I said before, this is the
day before a holiday. We're hoping to get some word before the holiday.
We also cannot presume. We can't be . . .
<P>Ivan Pope: Sorry to obsess like this, but it seems to me that if you
got the go-ahead tomorrow, then you're gonna start working on this group
of 10 people. So you're not even prepared for the event.
<P>Esther Dyson: There are some people who have been thinking about it,
but we do not have a list yet ready to spring upon the world. But no, it's
not a surprise to us that these things exist. These requirements.
<P>[??]: I know I'm not one to address that question to the Commission.
But two or three supplementary points. First of all, the Commission has
already said, officially, that the 11th Amendment is a significant issue
from the point of view of competition policy, and it is currently being
reviewed by DG4, and if necessary, the Commission in the U.S. Department
of Justice will communicate on the matter.
<P>Secondly, the objective of a shared registry database, at least for
the existing Internet gTLDs, was, in fact, an agreed position. One of the
few agreed positions nearly 18 months ago. There is, to our mind, no political
. . . There has been no political obstacle in the past 18 months, to introducing
a shared registry system with a common SRS as some considerable time ago.
So I share Ivan's impatience, although I have no brief for this particular
form of registration system.
<P>Finally, the SRS ought to be standardized. Each registry, particularly
if we have multiple registries, . . . Because each registrar is going to
be dealing on behalf of its customers, with a wide range of TLD registries
in different parts of the world, in different markets, in different languages.
There is no reason, whatsoever, in addition to impose on the registrars,
different technologies. This is a simple interface; it should be standardized.
<P>[??]: If I may just make a comment in that regard. And, of course, we
have our own standards organization already built in. And I hope that the
first standardization effort that is going on will intimately involve the
IETF and the IAB, and, therefore, signal forward how the ICANN will operate.
<P>Amadeu Abril i Abril: Well, you know, we are approaching Christmas,
and when I was officially a child, I'm only mentally a child right now,
I remember that when we approached Christmas, it was an exciting time,
because we were waiting for what we called the Kings of Orient that present
some gifts. This is, you know, the _____________, the _______________ los
Nicklaus, or Santa Claus, or call as you want. We always had some _______________
of legitimacy of this strange person. You always suspected that our parents
were behind the cabal, allowing those people to come and bring the presents.
Well, no matter all that. What we really wanted is that they accomplish
our wishes, and we judge it their legitimacy against the gifts we got,
you know? Here in Europe, we tend to believe that you are the __________
and __________ Claus and Santa Claus and La Befana[??] and the Kings of
Orient, all together. I mean, we are ready to accept that you are the board,
and we applaud that. We suspect some of the cabals behind your magic brushes
of selection, but, you know, some of there are also our parents, so we
don't complain. Bad. You know, ultimately, we will judge your ________________
to be _____________ Santa Claus and the Kings of Orient against the gifts
you bring. And the gifts you bring us echoing something like Daniel or
Ivan said is first, that you learn, very soon, to distinguish noise from
voice, as you see where I mean.
<P>Second, you are not here in order to compete for the Hamurabi Code International
Award for the best ever written bylaws for international associations.
We can leave with less-than-perfect bylaws, provided that these bylaws
are used for certain policies for the well and the good of the Internet.
And this is exactly what we want from you. Thanks.
<P>Esther Dyson: I can't imagine any finer conclusion to this meeting.
Do you have . . .?
<P>[??]: ______________________.
<P>Esther Dyson: I'm not sure we're ready for that. Maybe you can all have
some beer and we hope you will toast us with champagne the next time we
come before you.
<P>Again, I want to thank everybody involved here, starting with the EU
and Christopher, all the panelists who shared their wisdom, all the attendees
who also shared their wisdom, and especially Abril who shared a metaphor.
Thank you very much.
<P>Esther Dyson: If anybody would like to hear a very carefully-phrased
announcement which I'm not going to read because I can't read his handwriting,
and this is written by the lawyers, I here present to you Patrick Worms,
our P.R. Counsel, who's going to read you a very carefully-hedged statement.
<P>Patrick Worms: This is the kind of writing that I would never be able
to get down on paper, so listen carefully. "I can announce today, that
it has been advised by the U.S. government, that the government will enter
into a Memorandum of Understanding with ICANN, pursuant to which ICANN
will become responsible for the privatization of the domain name system."
