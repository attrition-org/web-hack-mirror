<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A meeting of the Board of Directors of the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (the &quot;Corporation&quot;)
was held by teleconference on October 24, 1999. The following
Directors of the Corporation were present by telephone: Geraldine
Capdeboscq (joined after beginning of meeting), George Conrades,
Gregory L. Crew, Esther Dyson, Hans Kraaijenbrink, Michael Roberts,
Eugenio Triana, and Linda Wilson. Also present on the teleconference
were Andrew McLaughlin, Interim Secretary of the Corporation;
and Joe Sims, Louis Touton, and Michael Weinberg of Jones, Day,
Reavis &amp; Pogue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The meeting was called to order by Esther
Dyson at 8:05 am U.S. Eastern Daylight Time.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="Approval"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">APPROVAL OF MINUTES</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Touton noted that minutes of nine Board
meetings since March 4, 1999, had been posted on the ICANN web
site and should be formally approved by Board resolution. Two
corrections were noted to the posted version of the minutes of
the August 24, 1999 meeting. First, in the second paragraph under
the heading &quot;Independent Review,&quot; the word &quot;when&quot;
should read &quot;after.&quot; Second, the second sentence under
the heading &quot;Y2K Report by Root Server System Advisory Committee&quot;
should read: &quot;He noted that the root server operators have
been working on these matters since July 1998 and the Committee
has authored, in co-operation with a range of interested parties,
a report which has been published on the ICANN website.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Initial Board unanimously adopted the following resolutions:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><A NAME="99.110"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [99.110]
  that the Minutes of the Meetings of the Board for March 4, March
  31, May 27, June 23, July 16, July 26, August 12, and September
  9, 1999, are hereby approved and adopted by the Board as posted.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="99.111"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [99.111]
  that the Minutes of the Meeting of the Board for August 26, 1999,
  are hereby approved and adopted by the Board as corrected.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A corrected version of the August 26 minutes
will be posted on the ICANN website.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="UDRP"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">IMPLEMENTATION OF
UNIFORM DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICY</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Touton described the proposed implementation
of the uniform dispute resolution policy adopted by the Board
at its August 26, 1999 meeting in Santiago, Chile. He noted that
implementation documents, consisting of a <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-policy-29sept99.htm">written
statement of the policy</A> and <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-29sept99.htm">rules
for administrative proceedings</A>, had been posted on the ICANN
website (on September 29, 1999) and that over 90 written comments
had been received. He then reviewed three documents that had been
furnished to the Board, consisting of a policy statement and rules
that staff had revised in view of the comments and the &quot;<A
HREF="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-second-staff-report-24oct99.htm">Second
Staff Report on Implementation Documents for Uniform Dispute Resolution
Policy</A>.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ms. Dyson raised the issue of public access
to decisions in administrative proceedings under the policy. Mr.
Touton noted that under <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-policy-24oct99.htm#4j">paragraph
4(j) of the policy</A>, decisions are presumptively public. Only
in an exceptional case may the administrative panel redact portions
of its decision (such as when they contain trade secrets and the
like) from the publicly available version. Mr. Touton indicated
that staff's intent is to review redactions to ensure they are
not being made inappropriately.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At this point, Ms. Capdeboscq joined the
meeting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Triana noted that the policy is minimalist
in that only cases of abusive registration are subject to administrative
proceedings. Mr. Touton described the various alternatives for
selection of providers and panelists and explained that the documents
being considered adopted a mechanism giving both parties a say
in the selection of panelists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Touton noted that, once the policy and
rules documents are approved, a substantial amount of work remains
to complete implementation, including coordination with registrars
and dispute-resolution service providers. He indicated that staff
would strive to have the policy in effect for new cases arising
from currently accredited registrars by approximately the end
on November, but that full implementation, including arrangements
for handling backlog cases, could take several months longer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">During this discussion, Mr. Conrades left
the meeting, noting his support for approval of the implementation
documents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon motion duly made and seconded, the
Initial Board unanimously adopted the following resolutions:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, on April 30, 1999, the World Intellectual
  Property Organization presented a report with its recommendations
  to ICANN on, among other things, a uniform policy for resolution
  of domain name disputes;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, at the ICANN meeting held in Santiago,
  Chile on August 24-26, 1999, a group of approximately twenty
  registrars presented a proposed a Model Dispute Resolution Policy
  for Voluntary Adoption, which they had agreed to adopt;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, at the Santiago meeting in <A
  HREF="minutes-26august99.htm#99.81">Resolution
  99.81</A>, the Board accepted the consensus recommendation of
  the Domain Name Supporting Organization, and adopted a uniform
  domain-name dispute resolution policy for accredited registrars
  in the .com, .net, and .org top-level domains;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, in <A HREF="minutes-26august99.htm#99.82">Resolution
  99.82</A> the Board directed the President, with the assistance
  of ICANN staff and counsel, to prepare implementation documents
  for approval by the Board after public notice and comment;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, in preparing implementation documents
  the President, staff, and counsel received valuable insights
  and advice from a small drafting committee consisting of J. Scott
  Evans, A. Michael Froomkin, Kathryn A. Kleiman, Steven J. Metalitz,
  and Rita A. Rodin;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, the Board recognizes the significant
  contribution of the members of the small drafting committee and
  expresses its deep appreciation for the personal sacrifices that
  effort required;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, the implementation documents (consisting
  of a draft policy and procedures) prepared by the President,
  staff, and counsel were posted on the ICANN web site for public
  comment on September 29, 1999;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, approximately 90 comments were
  received on the web site;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, the Board members have reviewed
  or been informed of the comments received on the draft policy
  and procedures and have given them due consideration;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, the President, staff, and counsel
  have made various adjustments and clarifications to the implementation
  documents in response to the comments; and</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">WHEREAS, the President recommends that
  the implementation documents be approved for use in implementing
  the policy; it is now</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="99.112"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">RESOLVED [99.112]
  that the Board finds that the implementation documents (namely,
  the statement of &quot;Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution
  Policy&quot; attached as <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-policy-24oct99.htm">Exhibit
  A</A> to these minutes and the &quot;Rules for Uniform Domain
  Name Dispute Resolution Policy&quot; attached as <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm">Exhibit
  B</A> to these minutes) faithfully embody the uniform dispute
  resolution policy adopted in <A HREF="minutes-26august99.htm#99.81">Resolution
  99.81</A>.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="99.113"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.113]
  that the President is authorized and directed to proceed immediately
  with implementation of the uniform dispute resolution policy
  adopted in <A HREF="minutes-26august99.htm#99.81">Resolution
  99.81</A> using the implementation documents approved in <A 
  HREF="#99.112">Resolution 99.112</A> (or such variation as he
  determines, with the concurrence of the General Counsel, is consistent
  with the policy adopted in <A HREF="minutes-26august99.htm#99.81">Resolution
  99.81</A>) on a schedule the President establishes to allow orderly
  implementation, including notification of accredited registrars
  and the entry of agreements for the provisional approval of one
  or more dispute-resolution service providers as provided in <A
  HREF="minutes-26august99.htm#99.84">Resolution
  99.84</A>.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="99.114"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.114]
  that the President and General Counsel are authorized to monitor
  the ongoing operation of the administrative dispute-resolution
  mechanism described in <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-policy-24oct99.htm#4">Paragraph
  4</A> of the &quot;Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy&quot;
  and to make such adjustments to the Policy's implementation from
  time to time as they determine appropriate, including adjustments
  to the terms and extent of provisional approval of dispute-resolution
  service providers.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="99.115"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [99.115]
  that the Board requests the General Counsel, with the assistance
  of staff, to prepare a summary of matters arising in the drafting
  process that should be considered as possible future refinements
  to the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy and to transmit that
  list to the Domain Name Supporting Organization for its study
  of those matters, with a view toward submission to the Board
  in the year 2000 of any recommendations the DNSO may have for
  such refinements.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="AtLargeBylaws"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">AMENDMENTS
TO BYLAWS CONCERNING AT LARGE MEMBERSHIP AND OTHER MATTERS</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. McLaughlin described the proposed amendments
to the bylaws that were posted on the ICANN website on October
10, 1999. These amendments had been prepared by the staff to implement
the Board's <A HREF="minutes-26august99.htm#99.91">directions</A>
concerning At Large Membership in Resolutions <A HREF="minutes-26august99.htm#99.87">99.87</A>
and <A HREF="minutes-26august99.htm#99.88">99.88</A>. At the meeting,
the Board discussed the geographic diversity requirements for
the At Large Council. Mr. McLaughlin noted a technical drafting
error in the posted documents, which had failed to require that
regionally selected At Large Council members be citizens of their
regions. It was concluded that this technical error should be
corrected. During this discussion, Mr. Triana left the call. The
Board also discussed the possibility of providing for a maximum
limit on the number of At Large Council members who are citizens
from any one region. The Board determined that this issue warranted
further consideration. After this discussion, Ms. Wilson left
the call.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the continuing discussion, the Board
reviewed the various comments submitted and concluded that several
deserved further discussion, and possible adoption. A few additional
technical drafting corrections were also noted. The Board instructed
the staff to further consider the various suggestions and to make
recommendations to the entire Board at its Los Angeles meeting.
Nevertheless, the Initial Board believed that it had the obligation,
under the bylaws by which it came into existence, to implement
its resolutions creating an At Large membership, and it did not
want to avoid that responsibility by deferring this entire issue
to Los Angeles, when approximately half the Board (those selected
by the SOs) will not have had the intensive exposure to, and extensive
discussion of, the At Large membership issues. The Board decided
that it was most appropriate to adopt the bylaws implementing
the At Large membership as originally recommended by the staff
(with correction of technical errors), and the Board did adopt
those bylaws after the meeting by <A HREF="consent-29oct99.htm">unanimous
consent</A>. In adopting these bylaws, however, the Board acted
with the clear understanding that at the Los Angeles meeting it
intends to consider, and perhaps adopt, some of the suggestions
(or variations thereof) contained in the comments submitted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The meeting was adjourned at 9:24 am Eastern
Daylight Time.</FONT></P>
