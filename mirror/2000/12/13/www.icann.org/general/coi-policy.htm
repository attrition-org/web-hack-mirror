<P><font face="Arial"><b>1. Purpose</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"> The purpose of the Conflicts of Interest policy is to ensure 
  that the deliberations and decisions of the Corporation are made in the interests 
  of the global Internet community as a whole, and to protect the interests of 
  the Corporation when it is contemplating entering into a transaction, contract, 
  or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an Interested Director, 
  Officer or Person (as defined below). An Interested Director, Officer or Person 
  may not use his or her position with respect to the Corporation, or confidential 
  corporate information obtained by him or her relating to the Corporation, in 
  order to achieve a financial benefit for himself or herself or for a third person, 
  including another nonprofit or charitable organization. This policy is intended 
  to supplement but not replace any applicable laws governing conflicts of interest 
  in nonprofit and charitable corporations.</font></P>

  transaction, contract, or arrangement in which a Director, Officer, or Interested 
  Person has a material financial interest.</font> 
  <p></P>

    possible conflicts of interest, an Interested Director or Interested Officer 
    must disclose the existence and nature of his of her material financial interest 
    to the Conflicts Committee prior to the consideration of the proposed transaction, 
    contract, or arrangement by the Board or any Committee of the Board.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial"> 7.3 Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists. 
    After disclosure of the financial interest, the disinterested members of the 
    Conflicts Committee shall determine whether a conflict of interest exists. 
    Neither the Board nor any Committee of the Board shall vote upon any proposed 
    transaction, contract, or arrangement in connection with which an actual or 
    possible conflict of interest has been disclosed by an Interested Director 
    until such time as the Conflicts Committee has addressed the actual or possible 
    conflict of interest. For matters pending before the full Board of Directors, 
    a referral to the Conflicts Committee will not be required where the Interested 
    Director fully discloses to the Board his or her financial interest and abstains 
    from participation in the Board's consideration of the proposed transaction, 
    contract, or arrangement.</font></P>

    Conflicts Committee and the Conflicts Committee has concluded that a conflict 
    of interest exists, the chairman of the Board or Committee of the Board shall, 
    if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate 
    alternatives to the proposed transaction, contract, or arrangement.</font> 
    <p></P>
    <P><font face="Arial"> 7.4.2 After exercising due diligence, the Board or 
      Committee shall determine whether the Corporation can obtain a more advantageous 
      transaction, contract, or arrangement with reasonable efforts from a person 
      or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest. </font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial"> 7.4.3 If a more advantageous transaction, contract, 
      or other arrangement is not reasonably attainable under circumstances that 
      would not give rise to a conflict of interest, the Board or Committee shall 
      determine by a majority vote of the disinterested Directors whether the 
      transaction, contract, or arrangement is in the Corporation's best interest 
      and for its own benefit and whether it is fair and reasonable to the Corporation, 
      and shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction, 
      contract, or arrangement in conformity with such determination.</font>

<BLOCKQUOTE><font face="Arial"> 8.1 If the Conflicts Committee has reasonable 
  cause to believe that a Director or Officer has failed to disclose an actual

  the basis for such belief and afford the Director or Officer an opportunity 
  to explain the alleged failure to disclose.</font> 
  <p></P>
  <P><font face="Arial"> 8.2 If, after hearing the response of the Director or 
    Officer and making such further investigation as may be warranted in the circumstances, 
    the Conflicts Committee determines that the member has in fact failed to disclose 
    an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall recommend to the Board 
    of Directors appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.</font></P>

    of a Director or Officer, or the termination of any contractual relationship 
    the Corporation may have with an Interested Person or other party.</font>
