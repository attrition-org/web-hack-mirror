        The ICANN <A HREF="bylaws.htm">Bylaws</A>
        require that ICANN have a conflicts of interest policy applicable
        to the Board of Directors. The basic elements of that policy
        are set forth in the <A HREF="bylaws.htm">Bylaws</A>,
        and have been elaborated in the <A HREF="coi-policy.htm">Conflicts
        of Interest Policy</A>. The Bylaws provision follows:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;The Board, through a committee designated
          for that purpose, shall require a statement from each Director
          not less frequently than once a year setting forth all business
          and other affiliations which relate in any way to the business
          and other affiliations of the Corporation. Each Director shall
          be responsible for disclosing to the Corporation any matter that
          could reasonably be considered to make such Director an 'interested
          director' within the meaning of Section 5233 of the California
          Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law (&quot;CNPBCL&quot;).
          In addition, each Director shall disclose to the Corporation
          any relationship or other factor that could reasonably be considered
          to cause the Director to be considered to be an 'interested person'
          within the meaning of Section 5227 of the CNPBCL. The Board shall
          adopt policies specifically addressing Director, Officer and
          Supporting Organization conflicts of interest. No Director shall
          vote on any matter in which he or she has a material and direct
          interest that will be affected by the outcome of the vote.&quot;
          [Bylaws, Art. V, Sec. 7]</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
