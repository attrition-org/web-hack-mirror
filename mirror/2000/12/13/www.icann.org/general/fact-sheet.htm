<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><b><u>What:</u></b></font></P>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">Formed in October 1998, the <a href="../index.html">Internet 
    Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)</a> is a non-profit, private 
    sector corporation formed by a broad coalition of the Internet's business, 
    technical, academic, and user communities. ICANN has been recognized by the 
    U.S. Government as the global consensus entity to coordinate the technical 
    management of the Internet's domain name system, the allocation of IP address 
    space, the assignment of protocol parameters, and the management of the root 
    server system. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">ICANN is dedicated to preserve the operational stability 
    of the Internet; to promote competition; to achieve broad representation of 
    the global Internet community; and to coordinate policy through private-sector, 
    bottom-up, consensus-based means.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><u><font face="Arial">Who: </font></u></b></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial">ICANN is a non-profit corporation with a 19-member volunteer 
    <a href="abouticann.htm">Board of Directors</a>. 
    Its Board has worked to pave the way for a smooth and stable transition from 
    the present technical management system, which has been funded and controlled 
    by the US government, to a new privatized and internationalized system. The 
    Board's chairman is Esther Dyson, the chairman of <a href="http://www.edventure.com">EDventure 
    Holdings</a>, which publishes the monthly Release 1.0 newsletter. The other 
    Directors have been drawn from a range of backgrounds and nations around the 
    world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">In early November 1999, ICANN's nine-member Initial Board 
    was joined by nine newly-elected Directors chosen by ICANN's three supporting 
    organizations -- the <a href="http://dnso.icann.org">Domain Name</a>, <a href="http://www.aso.icann.org">Address</a>, 
    and <a href="http://www.pso.icann.org">Protocol Supporting Organizations</a> 
    -- which collectively represent a broad cross-section of the global Internet's 
    business, technical, academic, and user communities. In addition, ICANN has 
    recently launched its <a href="http://members.icann.org">At Large Membership</a>, 
    which will be responsible for choosing At-Large Directors to replace those 
    on the Initial Board. By November 2000, the first round of At Large elections 
    will choose five At Large Directors.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><b><u>Why: </u></b></font></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial">In the past, many of the essential technical coordination 
    functions of the Internet were handled on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by the U.S. 
    government, its contractors and volunteers. This informal structure represented 
    the spirit and culture of the research community in which the Internet developed. 
    However, the growing international importance of the Internet has necessitated 
    the creation of a technical management and policy development body that is 
    both more formalized in structure, more accountable, and more fully reflective 
    of the diversity of the world's Internet communities. Specifically, ICANN 
    is assuming responsibility to coordinate the stable operation of the Internet 
    in four key areas: the Domain Name System (DNS); the allocation of IP address 
    space; the management of the root server system; and the coordination of protocol 
    number assignment.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><u><font face="Arial">How: </font></u></b></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial">ICANN's mandate is not to "run the Internet." Rather, 
    it is to coordinate the management of only those specific technical, managerial 
    and policy development tasks that require central coordination -- the assignment 
    of globally unique names, addresses, and protocol parameters.</font></p>
