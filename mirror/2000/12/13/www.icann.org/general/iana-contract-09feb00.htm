  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The contractor shall furnish the necessary
  personnel, material, equipment, services and facilities (except
  as otherwise specified), to perform the following Statement of
  Work/Specifications.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="12.2"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">12.2 BACKGROUND</FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Department of Commerce (DOC) has initiated
  an effort to transition the technical management of Internet
  Names and Addresses from the United States Government to the
  private sector. In June, 1998, DOC issued its Statement of Policy
  &quot;Management of Internet Names and Addresses,&quot; 63 Fed.
  Reg. 31741 (1998) (Statement of Policy) that sets forth the transition
  process. The Statement of Policy indicates that in order to maintain
  the stability and continuity of services, the United States Government
  will continue to participate in oversight Internet technical
  management functions during the transition.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Part of the transition process relates
  to the performance of certain Internet technical management functions
  collectively known as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
  (IANA). The IANA functions are currently performed by the Information
  Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California (USC)
  pursuant to a contract with the Department of Defense's Advanced
  Research Project Agency (DARPA).</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The portion of the IANA functions related
  to the DARPA/USC contract is nearing completion. However, the
  continued performance of these technical functions is vital to
  the stability and smooth functioning of the Internet. The National
  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), an
  agency of DOC, has initiated this purchase order action to fulfill
  its need for stability and continuity of services in the performance
  of the IANA technical functions during the transition period
  described in the Statement of Policy, and other related activities.</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="12.3"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">12.3 CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS</FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">NTIA has a requirement for a contractor
  to maintain the smooth operation of the Internet by performing
  the technical functions collectively known as the Internet Assigned
  Numbers Authority (IANA). The IANA technical functions are currently
  operated by the Information Sciences Institute at the University
  of Southern California pursuant to a contract with the Department
  of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency. In performance
  of this purchase order, the contractor shall perform the following
  IANA functions:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Coordination of the assignment of technical
    protocol parameters. This involves the review and assignment
    of unique values to various parameters (e.g., operation codes,
    port numbers, object identifiers, protocol numbers) used in various
    Internet protocols. This function also includes the dissemination
    of the listings of assigned parameters through various means
    (including on-line publication) and the review of technical documents
    for consistency with assigned values.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Administrative functions associated with
    root management. This function involves facilitation and coordination
    of the root zone of the domain name system. It includes receiving
    requests for and making routine updates of ccTLD contact and
    nameserver information. It also includes receiving delegation
    and redelegation requests, investigating the circumstances pertinent
    to those requests, and reporting on the requests. This function,
    however, does not include authorizing modifications, additions,
    or deletions to the root zone file or associated information
    that constitute delegation or redelegation of top-level domains.
    The purchase order award will not alter root system responsibilities
    defined in Amendment 11 of the Cooperative Agreement.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Allocation of IP address blocks. This
    involves overall responsibility for the allocation of IPv4 and
    IPv6 address space. It includes delegations of IP address blocks
    to regional registries for routine allocation, typically through
    downstream providers, to Internet end-users within the regions
    served by those registries. It also includes reservation and
    direct allocation of space for special purposes, such as multicast
    addressing, cable blocks, addresses for private networks as described
    in RFC 1918, and globally specified applications.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Other services. The contractor will perform
    other IANA functions as needed upon request of DOC. These functions
    may include the performance of periodic functions or supplemental
    functions identified by the contractor as part of the three (3)
    month performance progress report.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><A NAME="12.4"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">12.4 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Performance Reporting. The contractor shall
  prepare a final report regarding the performance of the IANA
  technical functions that shall include a description of the techniques,
  methods, software, and tools employed in the performance of the
  functions. The purpose of the report is to document standard
  operating procedures that may be readily adopted by other organizations.
  Further, the contractor shall submit a performance progress report
  every three (3) months that documents the performance of the
  functions. The contractor, therefore, shall:</FONT></P>

    report every three (3) months that contains statistical and narrative
    information on the performance of the functions during the previous
    three (3) months. The report shall include a summary of the major
    work performed for each of the functions during the previous
    three (3) months, including technical status, major events, problems
    encountered, and any projected significant changes related to
    performance of the functions.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

    of top-level domains. The purchase order award will not alter
    root system responsibilities defined in Amendment 11 of the Cooperative
    Agreement.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">-This purchase order, in itself, does not
    authorize the contractor to make substantive changes in established
    policy associated with the performance of the IANA functions.
    Procedures for policy development will remain the subject of
    a Joint Project Agreement (JPA) between DOC and ICANN. The JPA
    contemplates that the policy-development procedures developed
    under the JPA may result in adoption of new or changed policies
    concerning Internet technical management functions. To the extent
    those policies require alterations in the manner in which the
    IANA functions are performed, those alterations may be implemented
    upon mutual agreement of the parties.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
