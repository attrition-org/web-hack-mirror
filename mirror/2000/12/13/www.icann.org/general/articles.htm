server system; and (v) engaging in any other related lawful activity
in furtherance of items (i) through (iv).</P>

<P>4. The Corporation shall operate for the benefit of the Internet
community as a whole, carrying out its activities in conformity
with relevant principles of international law and applicable international
conventions and local law and, to the extent appropriate and consistent
with these Articles and its Bylaws, through open and transparent

or hereafter in effect, no director of the Corporation shall be
personally liable to the Corporation or its members, should the
Corporation elect to have members in the future, for or with respect
to any acts or omissions in the performance of his or her duties
as a director of the Corporation. Any repeal or modification of
this Article&nbsp;6 shall not adversely affect any right or protection
of a director of the Corporation existing immediately prior to
such repeal or modification.</P>

<P>7. Upon the dissolution of the Corporation, the Corporation's
assets shall be distributed for one or more of the exempt purposes
set forth in Article&nbsp;3 hereof and, if possible, to a &sect;&nbsp;501
(c)(3) organization organized and operated exclusively to lessen
the burdens of government and promote the global public interest
in the operational stability of the Internet, or shall be distributed
to a governmental entity for such purposes, or for such other
charitable and public purposes that lessen the burdens of government
by providing for the operational stability of the Internet. Any
assets not so disposed of shall be disposed of by a court of competent
jurisdiction of the county in which the principal office of the
Corporation is then located, exclusively for such purposes or
to such organization or organizations, as such court shall determine,
that are organized and operated exclusively for such purposes,
unless no such corporation exists, and in such case any assets
not disposed of shall be distributed to a &sect;&nbsp;501(c)(3)
corporation chosen by such court.</P>

<P>8. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Articles,
if the Corporation determines that it will not be treated as a
corporation exempt from federal income tax under &sect;&nbsp;501(c)(3)
of the Code, all references herein to &sect;&nbsp;501(c)(3) of
the Code shall be deemed to refer to &sect;&nbsp;501(c)(6) of
the Code and Article&nbsp;5(a)(ii), (b), (c) and (e) shall be
deemed not to be a part of these Articles.</P>

<P>9. These Articles may be amended by the affirmative vote of
at least two-thirds of the directors of the Corporation. When
the Corporation has members, any such amendment must be ratified
by a two-thirds (2/3) majority of the members voting on any proposed
amendment.</P>
