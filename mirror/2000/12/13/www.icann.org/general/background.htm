<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The <a href="../index.html">Internet Corporation 
  for Assigned Names and Numbers</a> (ICANN) is a private sector initiative to 
  assume responsibility for overseeing the technical coordination of the Domain 
  Name System (DNS), which allows Internet addresses (for example, web pages and 
  email accounts) to be found by easy-to-remember names, instead of numbers. Thanks 
  to the DNS, users can find the server at 140.147.248.209 simply by typing </font><A HREF="http://www.congress.gov"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>www.congress.gov</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> 
  into their browsers. </font></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Incorporated and headquartered in California, ICANN 
  is a non-profit corporation structured to make decisions on the basis of Internet 
  community consensus. As ICANN's start-up phase progresses, its Board of Directors 
  will be elected in part by a global membership of individual members of the 
  Internet community, and in part by supporting organizations representing the 
  business, technical, non-commercial and academic communities.</font></P>

<P><a name="#2"> </a>ICANN IS A COALITION OF THE INTERNET'S BUSINESS, TECHNICAL, 
  NON-COMMERCIAL, AND ACADEMIC COMMUNITIES</P>
</i></B> 
<P>ICANN represents a unprecedented effort by the Internet business, technical, 
  non-commercial and academic communities to create a globally representative 
  <U>private sector</U> (that is, non-governmental) policymaking body. Consistent 
  with the principle of maximum self-regulation in the high-tech economy , ICANN 
  is perhaps the foremost example of collaboration by the various constituents 
  of the Internet community – individuals and organizations, entrepreneurs and 
  educators, corporate enterprises and non-profit advocacy groups. Though often 
  contentious, the ICANN structure creates an open and transparent global forum 
  in which competing interests can work toward consensus.</P>
<B><I> 
<P><a name="#3"></a>ICANN HAS EARNED THE BROAD SUPPORT OF THE INTERNET COMMUNITY</P>
</i></B> 
<P>The many hundreds of individuals, organizations, corporations, engineers, entrepreneurs, 
  educators, and others that have participated in the process of creating and 
  building ICANN encompass a wide cross-section of the global Internet community. 
  ICANN recognizes that it will require significant ongoing effort in the coming 
  months to reach out and to bring previously uninvolved individuals and organizations 
  into the ICANN process, particularly in the developing world.</P>
<B><I> 
<P><a name="#4"></a>ICANN IS ENABLING COMPETITION FOR DOMAIN NAME (.COM) REGISTRATIONS</P>
</i></B> 
<P>To accomplish this, ICANN and the Department of Commerce (DoC) entered into 
  a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on November 25, 1998, agreeing to work together 
  to manage the transition from government control to private sector control. 
  The single most visible and important element of DNS management is the registration 
  of domain names (for example, .com, .org and .net). A single historical provider, 
  Network Solutions, has for years enjoyed a government-granted monopoly over 
  new domain name registrations and renewals.</P>
<P>Under the MoU, ICANN has already accredited an initial group of five new competitive 
  registrars (America Online, CORE, France Telecom, Melbourne IT, and register.com), 
  as part of a test of the Shared Registration System, which will permit competition 
  among multiple registrars in this very public component of the Internet’s underlying 
  technology. Following completion of the test and the negotiation of an acceptable 
  registry agreement with Network Solutions, at least 52 other companies from 
  around the world will also be eligible to offer registration services alongside 
  Network Solutions, heralding a new era of full and open competition.</P>
<B><I> 
<P><a name="#5"></a>COMPETITION WILL DRIVE DOWN REGISTRATION COSTS AND IMPROVE 
  CONSUMER CHOICE FOR BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS</P>
</i></B> 
<P>The move to ICANN-administered open competition in the market for domain name 
  registrations, with the addition of dozens of accredited competitive registrars, 
  is likely to see consumers reap significant price benefits far in excess of 
  ICANN's administrative costs.</P>
<B><I> 
<P><a name="#6"></a>ICANN HAS NO INHERENT AUTHORITY AND CANNOT IMPOSE "TAXES" 
  ON ANYONE</P>
</i></B> 
<P>Building a global, consensus-driven organization has been a complicated and 
  contentious task. The development of consensus from vastly diverse views and 
  interests is a daunting challenge. </P>
<P>ICANN has no statutory or other governmental power: its authority is entirely 
  a consequence of voluntary contracts and compliance with its consensus policies 
  by the global Internet community. It has no power to force any individual or 
  entity to do anything; its &quot;authority&quot; is nothing more than the reflection 
  of the willingness of the members of the Internet community to use ICANN as 
  a consensus development vehicle.</P>
<B><I> 
<P><a name="#7"></a>ICANN SEEKS PUBLIC INPUT BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER ITS CONSENSUS-BASED 
  DECISION MAKING PROCESS</P>
</i></B> 
<P>ICANN was created and has developed under the full scrutiny of the public eye. 
  The agendas, results, and minutes of the Initial Board’s deliberations are widely 
  publicized, and posted in advance. The Board holds a quarterly public meeting 
  where everything on the agenda is subject to full and open public discussion. 
  In order to reduce costs for participants, ICANN broadcasts its public meetings 
  live over the Internet, allowing remote participants to watch and send comments 
  and questions by email to the meeting room. The text of all resolutions adopted 
  by the Board is immediately released, and the Board holds a public press conference. 
  All decisions of substance are preceded by prior notice and a full opportunity 
  for public comment.</P>
<P>Beginning at its <a href="http://www.icann.org/santiago/santiago-details.htm">August 
  24-26 meetings in Santiago</a>, ICANN's Board meetings will be open to the public 
  for observation, in person and via realtime webcast.</P>
<P> </P>

<P><a name="#8"></a>ICANN WAS FORMED IN RESPONSE TO A U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 
  WHITE PAPER</P>
</i></B> 
<P>ICANN was created by members of the Internet community in response to a June 
  1998 <a href="white-paper-05jun98.htm">White Paper</a>, issued by the U.S. Department 
  of Commerce (DOC). As the Internet developed, DNS functions were carried out 
  by a variety of volunteers and US Government contractors. A non-competitive, 
  government-funded system developed. The DOC's White Paper envisaged a &quot;global, 
  consensus, non-profit corporation&quot;, to serve as the means by which DNS 
  management could be privatized, enabling an open, competitive system.</P>
