        <H5><FONT FACE="Arial">(Posted September 13, 1999)</FONT></H5>
        <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Q:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> What
        is ICANN doing regarding resolution of trademark/domain-name
        disputes?<BR>
<BR>
        <B>A:</B> As envisioned in the U.S. Government's <A HREF="white-paper-05jun98.htm">White
        Paper on Management of Internet Names and Addresses</A>, one
        of the issues ICANN has been addressing is a dispute-resolution
        policy for trademark/domain name disputes. At the ICANN meeting
        held August 24-26, 1999 in Santiago, Chile, ICANN's Board of
        Directors <A HREF="../santiago/santiago-resolutions.htm#anchor16725">adopted</A>
        a dispute resolution policy to be applied uniformly by all ICANN-accredited
        registrars in the .com, .net, and .org top-level domains.</FONT></P>
        <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Q:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> How
        are disputes to be handled under the policy?</FONT></P>
        <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">A:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> In
        general, the policy provides that registrars receiving complaints
        concerning the impact of domain names they have registered on
        trademarks or service marks will take no action until they receive
        instructions from the domain-name holder or an order of a court,
        arbitrator, or other neutral decision maker deciding the parties'
        dispute. There is an exception in the policy, however, for disputes
        involving domain names that are shown to have been registered
        in abusive attempts to profit from another's trademark (i.e.
        cybersquatting and cyberpiracy). In these cases of abusive registration,
        the complaining party can invoke a special administrative procedure
        to resolve the dispute. Under this procedure, the dispute will
        be decided by neutral persons selected from panels established
        for that purpose. The procedure will be handled in large part
        online, is designed to take less than 45 days, and is expected
        to cost about $1000 in fees to be paid to the entities providing
        the neutral persons. Parties to such disputes will also be able
        to go to court to resolve their dispute or to contest the outcome
        of the procedure.</FONT></P>
        <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Q:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> What
        process was used to formulate the policy?</FONT></P>
        <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">A:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> In
        1997 and 1998, the U.S. Government, in connection with its formulation
        of the <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/dnsdrft.htm">Green
        Paper</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">White
        Paper</A> on privatization of management of the Internet domain-name
        system, received many comments regarding problems that had arisen
        concerning disputes between holders of domain names and holders
        of trademarks. At the conclusion of this process, the U.S. Government
        invited the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to
        conduct a study of the relationship between domain names and
        intellectual property and make recommendations to ICANN. After
        a ten-month process of public consultation, WIPO presented <A
        HREF="http://wipo2.wipo.int/process/eng/final_report.html">recommendations
        on dispute resolution</A> on April 30, 1999.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">At the May 25-27, 1999 ICANN meeting (held
        in Berlin), ICANN's Board of Directors <A HREF="../minutes/berlinminutes.html">endorsed</A>
        the principle that there should be a uniform dispute-resolution
        policy for all registrars that register names in the .com, .net,
        and .org top-level domains, and asked the ICANN Domain Name Supporting
        Organization (DNSO) to study the issues and make recommendations
        concerning dispute resolution. In view of the impending introduction
        of competition by many registrars under the Shared Registry System
        testbed program, the Board also called on the ICANN-accredited
        testbed registrars to work together to formulate a model dispute-resolution
        policy for prompt voluntary adoption.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">On August 3, 1999, the DNSO <A HREF="../santiago/udrp.htm">recommended</A>
        to ICANN's Board that it adopt a uniform dispute-resolution policy
        for all registrars in the .com, .net, and .org top-level domains.
        Later in August, a group of about 20 registrars (including testbed
        registrars, post-testbed registrars, and Network Solutions) <A
        HREF="../santiago/registrar-dispute-policy.htm">presented
        a model policy</A> they had worked together to prepare. These
        two proposed policies, which were quite similar in principle,
        were considered by various groups, including ICANN's Board, at
        the August 1999 ICANN meeting held in Santiago, Chile.</FONT></P>
        <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Q:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> Was
        the public given an opportunity to provide input?</FONT></P>
        <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">A:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> Yes.
        Throughout the process, there were many invitations for public
        comment, both online and at meetings held throughout the world.
        These invitations started in the U.S. Government's Green and
        White Paper processes in 1997 and 1998, and continued in the
        WIPO consultations and in connection with the analysis conducted
        by ICANN's DNSO. As a result, several thousand comments were
        received from a broad array of Internet stakeholders. The resulting
        policy is the collective effort of dozens of individuals who
        worked to find the best reconciliation of and compromise among
        all the comments.</FONT></P>
        <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Q:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> Is
        the policy that was adopted the one that WIPO presented on April
        30?</FONT></P>
        <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">A:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> In
        its <A HREF="http://wipo2.wipo.int/process/eng/final_report.html">April
        30 report</A>, WIPO recommended several general principles for
        dispute resolution and presented a written policy and procedures
        that would implement those principles. Based on the work of the
        DNSO and the registrars' group, as well as public comment, there
        was strong general support for most of the WIPO-recommended principles.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">However, some groups in the ICANN community,
        particularly those representing non-commercial organizations
        and individual domain-name holders, voiced concerns that some
        aspects of the policy would have unintended consequences or did
        not adequately meet their concerns regarding individual and non-commercial
        uses, free speech, rights to court review, and reverse domain-name
        hijacking. In response, ICANN's Board determined that some clarifications
        and revisions should be made to address these concerns.</FONT></P>

        24, 1999 and various public comments received that a uniform

        of cybersquatting and cyberpiracy so that legitimate individual,
        non-commercial, and free-speech activities are not impaired;
        (b) to give both parties equal rights to challenge administrative

        adopted by ICANN's Board at the August 1999 meeting in Santiago.
        The committee expects to prepare two main implementation documents:
        a statement of the dispute resolution policy that includes a
        precise set of criteria for establishing &quot;abusive registration&quot;
        and a set of procedures to be used for administrative resolution

        issues requiring further consideration, ICANN's Board will promptly
        consider approving the implementation documents, probably at
        a telephone meeting. To the extent that the implementation documents

        In July, 1997, the Clinton Administration published an executive
        order calling for privatization of the Internet Domain Name System
        (DNS) and began an open and consultative policy development process
        which lead to the publication of a document entitled &quot;Management
        of Internet Names and Addresses,&quot; commonly known as the
        <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">White
        Paper</A>, in June, 1998 . The White Paper stated the desire
        of the U.S. Government that a private, non-profit corporation
        be formed to assume responsibility for the Domain Name and IP
        addressing systems and certain related functions, and called
        for proposals to be submitted to accomplish this goal.</FONT></P>

        in new DNS Corporation</FONT></U></I><FONT FACE="Arial">. With
        respect to representation, the White Paper stated,</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;The new corporation should operate
          as a private entity for the benefit of the Internet community
          as a whole. The development of sound, fair, and widely accepted
          policies for the management of DNS will depend on input from
          the broad and growing community of Internet users. Management
          structures should reflect the functional and geographic diversity
          of the Internet and its users. Mechanisms should be established
          to ensure international participation in decision making.&quot;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

          is sufficiently flexible to permit evolution to reflect changes
          in the constituency of Internet stakeholders. Nominations to
          the Board of Directors should preserve, as much as possible,
          the tradition of bottom-up governance of the Internet, and Board

        Subsequently, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) recognized
        ICANN -- the corporation proposed by Dr. Jon Postel in September,
        1998 -- in a Memorandum of Understanding/Joint Project Agreement
        dated November 25, 1998. With regard to membership, the MOU specified
        that ICANN and DOC would, &quot;8. Collaborate on the design,
        development, and testing of appropriate membership mechanisms
        that foster accountability to and representation of the global
        and functional diversity of the Internet and its users, within
        the structure of the private-sector DNS management organization.&quot;</FONT></P>

         FACE="Arial">. The ICANN Bylaws provide for four organizational
        units having membership attributes. Three of the units are named
        &quot;Supporting Organizations&quot; (SO) and are designed to
        provide specific mechanisms for the participation of business
        and technical interests in the policy development and consensus
        mechanisms of ICANN. The fourth is an At Large membership designed
        to ensure adequate representation, on a worldwide basis, of the
        interests of all Internet users. Each SO names three ICANN Directors,
        while the At Large membership names nine, for a total of eighteen
        elected Directors and an ex officio voting Chief Executive Officer.
        Consistent with both Internet tradition and the guidance of the
        White Paper, the ICANN Board has worked closely with the Internet
        community to support bottom-up and self-organizing efforts for
        all four of its membership entities. As of August, 1999, constituents
        of each of the Supporting Organizations had submitted and received
        approval of proposals for their creation and self-administration.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Seeking advice from the community on the

        ICANN created a <A HREF="../membership-com.html">Membership

        its recommendations on a range of membership policy and procedural
        issues. To assist the MAC with its work, ICANN commissioned a

        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">After considering the staff reports and

        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In addition, to give some sustainable momentum
        to the planning and implementation of a large and globally diverse
        membership, the ICANN Board authorized the creation of a Membership

         FACE="Arial">. After considering a range of issues affecting
        structure, the ICANN Directors have adopted an indirect representation
        mechanism in which an At Large membership of a minimum size of
        5000 individuals will elect an At Large Council composed of up
        to eighteen members. The At Large Council will in turn select
        nine individuals to become the At Large Directors of ICANN. Up
        to ten members of the At Large Council will be elected from each
        of the five geographic regions into which ICANN is currently
        divided, with no two regional members coming from the same country.
        The remaining up to eight members will be elected from a single
        global pool of candidates, with no restrictions on geographic
        origin.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Balancing a desire to encourage wide participation
        in ICANN membership on a worldwide basis with the need to protect
        against election fraud, the minimum requirements for an individual
        to become an At Large member will be (a) completion of an online
        membership application, including a statement of a commitment
        to participate in ICANN's activities; (b) a working Internet
        email address; and (c) a single physical residence verified by

        wish to proceed expeditiously with implementation of the At Large
        membership so that their elected successors may take office as
        soon as possible. However, translation of the membership structure
        that has been adopted by the Board into detailed plans and procedures
        that can operate faultlessly in a worldwide, interactive Internet
        environment requires significant staff and technical resources.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The membership implementation plan, which
        is being developed under the direction of interim President/CEO
        Mike Roberts, has six program elements, which will proceed in
        a parallel but coordinated manner.</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(1) Identify a funding source sufficient
          to meet the minimum expenditure requirements of the initial phase
          of the At Large membership program. An estimated budget of $100,000
          has been adopted.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(2) Engage staff to manage and implement
          the program for at least the next six months. A membership program
          manager position has been defined and created. A search for qualified
          applicants will begin as soon as funding is assured.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(3) Complete plans for the creation of
          an At Large membership component of ICANN. The membership program
          manager will be responsible for development of detailed plans,
          resource requirements and timing. The plan will be based on previous
          work by the MAC and ICANN staff, Board membership resolutions,
          and assistance from the new Membership Implementation Task Force.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(4) Obtain necessary computer and network
          resources to support the membership database and applications.
          The membership database and online server will be located at
          the ICANN administrative headquarters in Marina del Rey, California,
          using ICANN computer facilities and under the supervision of
          ICANN technical staff. Design, development, installation and
          testing of membership software and hardware will be contracted
          to a qualified technical services firm.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(5) Provide administrative and logistic
          support for the new Membership Implementation Task Force. The
          membership program manager will be primary liaison to the task
          force, whose intended functions include carrying out a worldwide
          outreach program to recruit At Large members, reviewing specifications
          for membership computer programs, assisting with organization
          of the At Large Council, providing independent oversight of the
          initial At Large Council election, and proposing a permanent
          funding mechanism for the At Large Membership.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(6) Specify, develop and test necessary
          processes and procedures and hold the first At Large Council
          election. Depending on progress toward meeting the minimum At
          Large membership threshold requirement of 5000 individual members,
          the ICANN Board is expected to approve election procedures and
          set a date for the first election of members of the At Large
          Council at its first meeting in the year 2000, currently expected
          to be the first week in March. Prior to approving the election
          date, the membership staff, working with the task force, will
          have completed and tested the required computer programs and
          related fraud protection provisions of the election procedures.</FONT></P>

        <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">A:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> ICANN
        and its constituent organizations have recently begun the process
        of considering whether, how, and when to add new generic top-level
        domains (gTLDs) to the domain name system. In recent years, a
        number of plans have been proposed to create new gTLDs, such
        as .firm, .store, .law, and .arts., and some companies have even
        taken orders for them. ICANN, which administers the domain name
        system, has not yet made a decision for or against the addition
        of new generic top-level domains. The ICANN process provides
        for the development of consensus-based policies (such as policies
        concerning new names) in an open, transparent and bottom-up manner
        in which interested individuals have an opportunity to participate
        and comment.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">There are many arguments both for and against
        new gTLDs: for example, those in favor argue that new gTLDs are
        technically easy to create, will help relieve perceived scarcities
        in existing name spaces, and are consistent with a general push
        towards consumer choice and diversity of options; those opposed
        point to greater possibilities for consumer confusion, the risk
        of increased trademark infringement, cybersquatting and cyberpiracy.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN's <A HREF="http://www.dnso.org/">Domain
        Name Supporting Organization (DNSO)</A> has primary responsibility
        for making a recommendation on new gTLDs to the ICANN Board.
        On May 27, 1999, the ICANN Board of Directors referred to the
        DNSO a set of recommendations on new gTLDs submitted by the World
        Intellectual Property Organization; the DNSO's provisional Names
        Council responded by creating a Working Group to review the issue.
