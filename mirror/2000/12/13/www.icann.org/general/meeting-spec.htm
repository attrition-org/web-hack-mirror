  <p><font face="Arial">ICANN is actively seeking proposals from organizations 
    interested in hosting one of ICANN's meetings in the year 2001. In the Internet's 
    tradition of bottom-up self-organization, ICANN relies on the efforts of local 
    Internet organizations and/or <i>ad hoc</i> host committees to make its meetings 
    possible.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The Board has tentatively <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-10mar00.htm#ScheduleforFutureMeetings">decided</a> 
    to hold its meetings according to the following schedule and regional rotation:</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial">ICANN meetings run at least four days. A set of ICANN 
    meeting typically runs four days:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>Day 1</b> - Orientation session for new participants; 
      Advisory Committees; DNSO Constituencies and Working Groups; Governmental 
      Advisory Committee</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>Day 2</b> - Advisory Committees; DNSO Names Council 
      and General Assembly; Governmental Advisory Committee</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>Day 3</b> - ICANN Public Forum</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>Day 4</b> - ICANN Board of Directors meeting (open 
      to public observation)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">Days 1 and 2 entail a range of differently sized rooms 
    (detailed below). Days 2, 3, and 4 require a large auditorium with Internet 
    connectivity suitable for webcasting (see below).  The large auditorium, and all locally-provided facilities associated with it,
    must also be available starting 
    on "Day 0" to allow two full days of setup.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">By way of example, previous ICANN meetings have been held 
    in <a href="../minutes/prelim-report-16jul00.htm">Yokohama</a>, 
  <A href="../minutes/prelim-report-10mar00.htm">Cairo</A>,

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial">As a small non-profit organization, ICANN asks the local 
    host organization (or committee) to provide substantial in-kind support for 
    the costs of a set of meetings. For some past meetings, the local hosts have 
    secured sponsorships from local sources; for others, a local host organization 
    has assumed responsibility for providing the necessary meeting space, equipment, 
    personnel, and logistical support. ICANN will independently seek sponsors 
    from the broader Internet community to offset the costs of Board travel and 
    expenses, webcasting services, receptions, and coffee breaks.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">ICANN's objective is to keep its direct expenses as low 
    as possible (i.e., as close to zero as possible). One of the most important 
    factors in choosing a meeting location will necessarily be the ability of 
    the local organization or host committee to provide (directly or through local 
    sponsors) the necessary meeting space, equipment, personnnel, and logistical 
    support.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">At a minimum, ICANN asks the local host organization to 
    divide responsibilities as follows:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial"><b>Responsibility of local host organization/committee: 
      </b> </font> 
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial">Meeting spaces</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial">Work space for ICANN Board and staff</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial">Equipment (see below)</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial">Network connectivity and related equipment</font></li>
