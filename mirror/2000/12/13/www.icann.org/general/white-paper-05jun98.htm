      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Domain names are the familiar and easy-to-remember
      names for Internet computers (e.g., &quot;www.ecommerce.gov&quot;).
      They map to unique Internet Protocol (IP) numbers (e.g., 98.37.241.30)
      that serve as routing addresses on the Internet. The domain name
      system (DNS) translates Internet names into the IP numbers needed
      for transmission of information across the network. <BR>

      Development:</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
      &nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">More than 25 years ago, the U.S. Government
      began funding research necessary to develop packet-switching
      technology and communications networks, starting with the &quot;ARPANET&quot;
      network established by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research
      Projects Agency (DARPA) in the 1960s. ARPANET was later linked
      to other networks established by other government agencies, universities
      and research facilities. During the 1970s, DARPA also funded
      the development of a &quot;network of networks;&quot; this became
      known as the Internet, and the protocols that allowed the networks
      to intercommunicate became known as Internet protocols (IP).
<BR>
      &nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As part of the ARPANET development work
      contracted to the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA),
      Dr. Jon Postel, then a graduate student at the university, undertook
      the maintenance of a list of host names and addresses and also
      a list of documents prepared by ARPANET researchers, called Requests
      for Comments (RFCs). The lists and the RFCs were made available
      to the network community through the auspices of SRI International,
      under contract to DARPA and later the Defense Communication Agency
      (DCA) (now the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)) for
      performing the functions of the Network Information Center (the
      NIC). <BR>
      &nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">After Dr. Postel moved from UCLA to the
      Information Sciences Institute (ISI) at the University of Southern
      California (USC), he continued to maintain the list of assigned
      Internet numbers and names under contracts with DARPA. SRI International
      continued to publish the lists. As the lists grew, DARPA permitted
      Dr. Postel to delegate additional administrative aspects of the
      list maintenance to SRI, under continuing technical oversight.
      Dr. Postel, under the DARPA contracts, also published a list
      of technical parameters that had been assigned for use by protocol
      developers. Eventually these functions collectively became known
      as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). <BR>
      &nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Until the early 1980s, the Internet was
      managed by DARPA, and used primarily for research purposes. Nonetheless,
      the task of maintaining the name list became onerous, and the
      Domain Name System (DNS) was developed to improve the process.
      Dr. Postel and SRI participated in DARPA's development and establishment
      of the technology and practices used by the DNS. By 1990, ARPANET
      was completely phased out. <BR>
      &nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The National Science Foundation (NSF) has
      statutory authority for supporting and strengthening basic scientific
      research, engineering, and educational activities in the United
      States, including the maintenance of computer networks to connect
      research and educational institutions. Beginning in 1987, IBM,
      MCI and Merit developed NSFNET, a national high-speed network
      based on Internet protocols, under an award from NSF. NSFNET,
      the largest of the governmental networks, provided a &quot;backbone&quot;
      to connect other networks serving more than 4,000 research and
      educational institutions throughout the country. The National
      Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Department
      of Energy also contributed backbone facilities. <BR>
      &nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1991-92, NSF assumed responsibility
      for coordinating and funding the management of the non-military
      portion of the Internet infrastructure. NSF solicited competitive
      proposals to provide a variety of infrastructure services, including
      domain name registration services. On December 31, 1992, NSF
      entered into a cooperative agreement with Network Solutions,
      Inc. (NSI) for some of these services, including the domain name
      registration services. Since that time, NSI has managed key registration,
      coordination, and maintenance functions of the Internet domain
      name system. NSI registers domain names in the generic top level
      domains (gTLDs) on a first come, first served basis and also
      maintains a directory linking domain names with the IP numbers
      of domain name servers. NSI also currently maintains the authoritative
      database of Internet registrations. <BR>
      &nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1992, the U.S. Congress gave NSF statutory
      authority to allow commercial activity on the NSFNET.<SUP><A
      HREF="#N_5_">(5)</A></SUP> This facilitated connections between
      NSFNET and newly forming commercial network service providers,
      paving the way for today's Internet. Thus, the U.S. Government
      has played a pivotal role in creating the Internet as we know
      it today. The U.S. Government consistently encouraged bottom-up
      development of networking technologies, and throughout the course
      of its development, computer scientists from around the world
      have enriched the Internet and facilitated exploitation of its
      true potential. For example, scientists at CERN, in Switzerland,
      developed software, protocols and conventions that formed the
      basis of today's vibrant World Wide Web. This type of pioneering
      Internet research and development continues in cooperative organizations
      and consortia throughout the world. <BR>

        by allocating blocks of numerical addresses to regional IP registries
        (ARIN in North America, RIPE in Europe, and APNIC in the Asia/Pacific
        region), under contract with DARPA. In turn, larger Internet
        service providers apply to the regional IP registries for blocks
        of IP addresses. The recipients of those address blocks then
        reassign addresses to smaller Internet service providers and
        to end users.</FONT>

        &nbsp;</FONT>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The domain name space is constructed as
        a hierarchy. It is divided into top-level domains (TLDs), with
        each TLD then divided into second-level domains (SLDs), and so
        on. More than 200 national, or country-code, TLDs (ccTLDs) are
        administered by their corresponding governments or by private
        entities with the appropriate national government's acquiescence.
        A small set of gTLDs do not carry any national identifier, but
        denote the intended function of that portion of the domain space.
        For example, .com was established for commercial users, .org
        for not-for-profit organizations, and .net for network service
        providers. The registration and propagation of these key gTLDs
        are performed by NSI, under a five-year cooperative agreement
        with NSF. This agreement expires on September 30, 1998. <BR>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Internet technical community has been
      actively debating DNS management policy for several years. Experimental
      registry systems offering name registration services in an alternative
      set of exclusive domains developed as early as January 1996.
      Although visible to only a fraction of Internet users, alternative
      systems such as the name.space, AlterNIC, and eDNS affiliated
      registries<SUP><A HREF="#N_7_">(7)</A></SUP> contributed to the
      community's dialogue on the evolution of DNS administration.
<BR>
      &nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In May of 1996, Dr. Postel proposed the
      creation of multiple, exclusive, competing top-level domain name
      registries. This proposal called for the introduction of up to
      50 new competing domain name registries, each with the exclusive
      right to register names in up to three new top-level domains,
      for a total of 150 new TLDs. While some supported the proposal,
      the plan drew much criticism from the Internet technical community.<SUP><A
      HREF="#N_8_">(8)</A></SUP>&nbsp; The paper was revised and reissued.<SUP><A
      HREF="#N_9_">(9)</A></SUP>&nbsp; The Internet Society's (ISOC)
      board of trustees endorsed, in principle, the slightly revised
      but substantively similar version of the draft in June of 1996.
<BR>
      &nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">After considerable debate and redrafting
      failed to produce a consensus on DNS change, IANA and the Internet
      Society (ISOC) organized the International Ad Hoc Committee<SUP><A
      HREF="#N_10_">(10)</A></SUP>&nbsp; (IAHC or the Ad Hoc Committee)
      in September 1996, to resolve DNS management issues. The World
      Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the International
      Telecommunications Union (ITU) participated in the IAHC. The
      Federal Networking Council (FNC) participated in the early deliberations
      of the Ad Hoc Committee. <BR>
      &nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The IAHC issued a draft plan in December
      1996 that introduced unique and thoughtful concepts for the evolution
      of DNS administration.<SUP><A HREF="#N_11_">(11)</A></SUP>&nbsp;
      The final report proposed a memorandum of understanding (MoU)
      that would have established, initially, seven new gTLDs to be
      operated on a nonexclusive basis by a consortium of new private
      domain name registrars called the Council of Registrars (CORE).<SUP><A
      HREF="#N_12_">(12)</A></SUP>&nbsp; Policy oversight would have
      been undertaken in a separate council called the Policy Oversight
      Committee (POC) with seats allocated to specified stakeholder
      groups. Further, the plan formally introduced mechanisms for
      resolving trademark/domain name disputes. Under the MoU, registrants
      for second-level domains would have been required to submit to
      mediation and arbitration, facilitated by WIPO, in the event
      of conflict with trademark holders. <BR>
      &nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Although the IAHC proposal gained support
      in many quarters of the Internet community, the IAHC process
      was criticized for its aggressive technology development and
      implementation schedule, for being dominated by the Internet
      engineering community, and for lacking participation by and input
      from business interests and others in the Internet community.<SUP><A
      HREF="#N_13_">(13)</A></SUP>&nbsp; Others criticized the plan
      for failing to solve the competitive problems that were such
      a source of dissatisfaction among Internet users and for imposing
      unnecessary burdens on trademark holders. Although the POC responded
      by revising the original plan, demonstrating a commendable degree
      of flexibility, the proposal was not able to overcome initial
      criticism of both the plan and the process by which the plan
      was developed.<SUP><A HREF="#N_14_">(14)</A></SUP>&nbsp; Important

      Others suggested that even if competition initially exists among

      systems would create lock-in and switching costs, making competition
      unsustainable in the long run. Finally, other commenters suggested

      their rights without very expensive litigation. For cyberspace
      to function as an effective commercial market, businesses must
      have confidence that their trademarks can be protected. On the
      other hand, management of the Internet must respond to the needs
      of the Internet community as a whole, and not trademark owners
      exclusively. The Green Paper proposed a number of steps to balance
      the needs of domain name holders with the legitimate concerns
      of trademark owners in the interest of the Internet community
      as a whole. The proposals were designed to provide trademark

      comments on an arrangement whereby, at the time of registration,
      registrants would agree to submit a contested domain name to

      of a domain name in the event of an objection by a trademark
      holder within a specified period of time after registration would
      significantly extend trademark holders' rights beyond what is
      accorded in the real world. They argued that such a provision
      would create a de facto waiting period for name use, as holders
      would need to suspend the use of their name until after the objection
      window had passed to forestall an interruption in service. Further,
      they argue that such a system could be used anti-competitively
      to stall a competitor's entry into the marketplace. <BR>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The suggestion that domain name registrants
      be required to agree at the time of registration to submit disputed
      domain names to the jurisdiction of specified courts was supported
      by U.S. trademark holders but drew strong protest from trademark
      holders and domain name registrants outside the United States.
      A number of commenters characterized this as an inappropriate
      attempt to establish U.S. trademark law as the law of the Internet.
      Others suggested that existing jurisdictional arrangements are
      satisfactory. They argue that establishing a mechanism whereby
      the judgment of a court can be enforced absent personal jurisdiction
      over the infringer would upset the balance between the interests
      of trademark holders and those of other members of the Internet
      community. <BR>

       FACE="Arial"> The U.S. Government will seek international support
      to call upon the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
      to initiate a balanced and transparent process, which includes
      the participation of trademark holders and members of the Internet
      community who are not trademark holders, to (1) develop recommendations
      for a uniform approach to resolving trademark/domain name disputes
      involving cyberpiracy (as opposed to conflicts between trademark
      holders with legitimate competing rights), (2) recommend a process
      for protecting famous trademarks in the generic top level domains,
      and (3) evaluate the effects, based on studies conducted by independent
      organizations, such as the National Research Council of the National
      Academy of Sciences, of adding new gTLDs and related dispute
      resolution procedures on trademark and intellectual property
      holders. These findings and recommendations could be submitted
      to the board of the new corporation for its consideration in
      conjunction with its development of registry and registrar policy
      and the creation and introduction of new gTLDs. <BR>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In trademark/domain name conflicts, there
      are issues of jurisdiction over the domain name in controversy
      and jurisdiction over the legal persons (the trademark holder
      and the domain name holder). This document does not attempt to
      resolve questions of personal jurisdiction in trademark/domain
      name conflicts. The legal issues are numerous, involving contract,
      conflict of laws, trademark, and other questions. In addition,
      determining how these various legal principles will be applied
      to the borderless Internet with an unlimited possibility of factual
      scenarios will require a great deal of thought and deliberation.
      Obtaining agreement by the parties that jurisdiction over the
      domain name will be exercised by an alternative dispute resolution
      body is likely to be at least somewhat less controversial than
      agreement that the parties will subject themselves to the personal
      jurisdiction of a particular national court. Thus, the references
      to jurisdiction in this policy statement are limited to jurisdiction
      over the domain name in dispute, and not to the domain name holder.

      database, we believe that a database should be maintained that
      permits trademark owners to obtain the contact information necessary
      to protect their trademarks. <BR>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Further, it should be clear that whatever
      dispute resolution mechanism is put in place by the new corporation,
      that mechanism should be directed toward disputes about cybersquatting
      and cyberpiracy and not to settling the disputes between two
      parties with legitimate competing interests in a particular mark.

      rightly settled in an appropriate court. <BR>

      the jurisdiction of a court where the &quot;A&quot; root server
      is maintained, where the registry is domiciled, where the registry
      database is maintained, or where the registrar is domiciled.
      We believe that allowing trademark infringement suits to be brought
      wherever registrars and registries are located will help ensure
      that all trademark holders - both U.S. and non-U.S. - have the
      opportunity to bring suits in a convenient jurisdiction and enforce
      the judgments of those courts. <BR>

      before it becomes available to the applicant. The failure to
      make a domain name applicant pay for its use of a domain name
      has encouraged cyberpirates and is a practice that should end

      development of policies or practices would need to be included
      in the new corporation's originating documents. For example,
      the new corporation's activities would need to be open to all
      persons who are directly affected by the entity, with no undue
      financial barriers to participation or unreasonable restrictions
      on participation based on technical or other such requirements.
      Entities and individuals would need to be able to participate
      by expressing a position and its basis, having that position
      considered, and appealing if adversely affected. Further, the
      decision making process would need to reflect a balance of interests

      changes should also be coordinated. <BR>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Similarly, coordination of the root server
      network is necessary if the whole system is to work smoothly.
      While day-to-day operational tasks, such as the actual operation
      and maintenance of the Internet root servers, can be dispersed,
      overall policy guidance and control of the TLDs and the Internet
      root server system should be vested in a single organization
      that is representative of Internet users around the globe. <BR>
      &nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Further, changes made in the administration
      or the number of gTLDs contained in the authoritative root system
      will have considerable impact on Internet users throughout the
      world. In order to promote continuity and reasonable predictability
      in functions related to the root zone, the development of policies
      for the addition, allocation, and management of gTLDs and the

      for robust, professional management of the new corporation. The
      new corporation could rely on separate, diverse, and robust name
      and number councils responsible for developing, reviewing, and
      recommending for the board's approval policy related to matters
      within each council's competence. Such councils, if developed,
      should also abide by rules and decision-making processes that
      are sound, transparent, protect against capture by a self-interested
      party and provide an open process for the presentation of petitions
      for consideration. The elected Board of Directors, however, should

      decisions should be recorded and made publicly available. Super-majority
      or even consensus requirements may be useful to protect against
      capture by a self-interested faction. The new corporation does
      not need any special grant of immunity from the antitrust laws
      so long as its policies and practices are reasonably based on,
      and no broader than necessary to promote the legitimate coordinating
      objectives of the new corporation. Finally, the commercial importance
      of the Internet necessitates that the operation of the DNS system,
