        <P><A NAME="1"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">1. This Memorandum of Understanding
        (&quot;MOU&quot;) defines an agreement between the Internet Engineering
        Task Force and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
        Numbers. Its intent is exclusively to define the technical work
        to be carried out by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
        on behalf of the Internet Engineering Task Force and the Internet
        Research Task Force. It is recognized that ICANN may, through
        the IANA, provide similar services to other organisations with
        respect to protocols not within IETF's scope (i.e. registries
        not created by IETF or IRTF action); nothing in this MOU limits
        ICANN's ability to do so.</FONT></P>
        <P><A NAME="2"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">2. This MOU will remain
        in effect until either modified or cancelled by mutual consent
        of the Internet Engineering Task Force and the Internet Corporation

        with at least six (6) months notice.</FONT></P>

        <P><A NAME="4"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">4. <U>Agreed technical
        work items</U>. ICANN agrees that during the term of this MOU
        it shall cause IANA to comply, for protocols within IETF's scope,
        with the following requirements, which ICANN and IETF acknowledge
        reflect the existing arrangements under which the IANA is operated:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><A NAME="4.1"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">4.1.The IANA will assign
          and register Internet protocol parameters only as directed by
          the criteria and procedures specified in RFCs, including Proposed,
          Draft and full Internet Standards and Best Current Practice documents,
          and any other RFC that calls for IANA assignment. If they are
          not so specified, or in case of ambiguity, IANA will continue
          to assign and register Internet protocol parameters that have
          traditionally been registered by IANA, following past and current
          practice for such assignments, unless otherwise directed by the
          IESG.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">If in doubt or in case of a technical dispute,
          IANA will seek and follow technical guidance exclusively from
          the IESG. Where appropriate the IESG will appoint an expert to
          advise IANA.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The IANA will work with the IETF to develop
          any missing criteria and procedures over time, which the IANA
          will adopt when so instructed by the IESG.</FONT></P>
          <P><A NAME="4.2"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">4.2. In the event of
          technical dispute between the IANA and the IESG, both will seek
          guidance from the IAB whose decision shall be final.</FONT></P>
          <P><A NAME="4.3"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">4.3. Two particular assigned
          spaces present policy issues in addition to the technical considerations
          specified by the IETF: the assignment of domain names, and the
          assignment of IP address blocks. These policy issues are outside
          the scope of this MOU.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Note that (a) assignments of domain names
          for technical uses (such as domain names for inverse DNS lookup),
          (b) assignments of specialised address blocks (such as multicast
          or anycast blocks), and (c) experimental assignments are not
          considered to be policy issues, and shall remain subject to the
          provisions of this Section 4. (For purposes of this MOU, the
          term &quot;assignments&quot; includes allocations.) In the event
          ICANN adopts a policy that prevents it from complying with the
          provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the assignments
          described in (a) - (c) above, ICANN will notify the IETF, which
          may then exercise its ability to cancel this MOU under Section
          2 above.</FONT></P>
          <P><A NAME="4.4"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">4.4. The IANA shall make
          available to the public, on-line and free of charge, information
          about each current assignment, including contact details for
          the assignee. Assignments published in RFCs by the RFC Editor
          and available publicly will be deemed to meet the requirements
          of this Section 4.4.</FONT></P>
          <P><A NAME="4.5"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">4.5. The IANA shall provide
          on-line facilities for the public to request Internet protocol
          parameter assignments and shall either execute such assignments,
          or deny them for non-conformance with applicable technical requirements,
          in a timely manner. There shall be no charge for assignments
          without the consent of the IAB. Requests shall only be denied
          on legitimate technical grounds.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">For protocols within the IETF scope (i.e.,
          registries created by IETF action), appeals against such denials
          may be made to the IESG and subsequently to the IAB as provided
          in 4.2 above.</FONT></P>
          <P><A NAME="4.6"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">4.6. The IANA shall have
          non-voting liaison seats on appropriate IETF committees as determined
          by the IETF, and may participate in all IETF discussions concerning
          technical requirements for protocol parameter assignment through
          such liaisons.</FONT></P>
          <P><A NAME="4.7"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">4.7. The IANA shall review
          all documents in IETF Last Call to identify any issues of concern
          to the IANA, and shall raise these issues with the IESG.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><A NAME="5"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">5. <U>Application to IRTF/IRSG</U>.
        The parties understand that certain of the protocol parameters
        to be assigned by IANA will be relevant to IRTF, rather than
        IETF. With respect to these protocol parameters, IANA will comply
        with the procedures set forth in Section 4, with the understanding
        that IRTF and IRSG shall be substituted for IETF and IESG, respectively,
        in such procedures. In the event of any question as to whether
        a particular protocol parameter relates principally to IETF or
        IRTF, the IAB shall have the authority to answer such question
        in its discretion.</FONT></P>
        <P><A NAME="6"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">6. <U>General</U>. This
        MOU does not constitute any of the parties as a partner, joint
        venturer, agent, principal or franchisee of any other party.
        The waiver of any provision of this MOU on any occasion shall
        not constitute a waiver for purposes of any other occasion. No
        party may transfer or assign any interest, right or obligation
        arising under this MOU without the prior written consent of each
        other party to this MOU.</FONT></P>
        <P><A NAME="7"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">7. <U>Effectiveness of
        MOU</U>. This Agreement requires the approval or ratification
        of the ICANN Board of Directors. The signatory for ICANN shall
        use his best efforts to secure and deliver to IETF such approval
        or ratification within two months of signing.</FONT></P>
