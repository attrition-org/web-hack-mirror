<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Formed in November 1998, the Internet 
  Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a non-profit, private 
  sector corporation that coordinates a select set of the Internet’s technical 
  management functions currently performed by the U.S. Government or its contractors 
  and volunteers. Between now and September 2000, ICANN will be gradually assuming 
  responsibility for coordinating the assignment of protocol parameters, the management 
  of the domain name system, the allocation of IP address space, and the management 
  of the root server system.</font></P>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">ICANN is a non-profit corporation headquartered 
    in Los Angeles, California, and managed by a board of directors. ICANN's structure 
    will consist of a broad At-Large Membership of individuals and several technical 
    and policy advisory organizations drawn from all over the world.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The At-Large Membership of ICANN will be designed 
    to be open and represent the broadest possible range of the Internet’s numerous 
    communities worldwide. The precise criteria for membership and the rights 
    and obligations of members are currently being formulated by the ICANN Board, 
    in response to recommendation’s from ICANN's Membership Advisory Committee. 
    The most important function of the At-Large members will be to elect successors 
    to the current nine members of the Initial Board, all of whom must step down 
    no later than September 2000. </font></p>

      Supporting Organization</a></U> (ASO) is concerned with the system of IP 
      addresses, such as 128.9.128.127, that uniquely identify the Internet's

      Name System, which makes possible the easy-to-remember names commonly used 
      to identify Internet locations and resources. The domain name system translates 
      domain names (like www.house.gov) into the IP address numbers that have 
      been assigned to specific computers;</font></li>

    to organise itself and define its own rules, and to be truly representative 
    of its unique, specialized constituencies – a process that involves substantial 
    public comment and discussion. Once recognized by the Initial Board, each 
    Supporting Organization has the right to name three directors and to serve 
    as ICANN’s primary policy advisory body for its respective area of expertise.</font></p>
