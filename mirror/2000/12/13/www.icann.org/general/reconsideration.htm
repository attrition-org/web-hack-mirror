<P><CENTER>[Adopted March 4, 1999, pursuant to ICANN Bylaws, Art. III, Sec. 4(a)]</CENTER></P>



<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Any person affected by an action of the Internet Corporation 
for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") may request review or reconsideration 
of that action by the Board of Directors. </P>

<P>The Board will establish and maintain a Committee of the Board consisting 
of not less than three directors to review and consider any such requests 
("Reconsideration Committee").  The Reconsideration Committee will have the 
authority to:  (i) evaluate requests for review or reconsideration, (ii) 
determine whether a stay of the contested action pending resolution of the 
request is appropriate, (iii) conduct whatever factual investigation is deemed 
appropriate, (iv) request additional written submissions from the affected party, 
or from other parties, and (v) make a recommendation to the Board of Directors 
on the merits of the request.</P>

<P>ICANN will absorb the normal administrative costs of the reconsideration 
process.  It reserves the right to recover from a party requesting review or 
reconsideration any costs which are deemed to be extraordinary in nature.</P>

<P>A request for review or reconsideration must be filed within 30 days after 
(a) the affected party or its affiliate receives notice of the action, or (b) 
ICANN posts notice of the action on its web site, whichever is sooner.  Requests 
for review or reconsideration must be submitted by email to 
<A HREF="mailto:reconsider@icann.org">reconsider@icann.org</A>.  
No particular form is required, but requesting parties must include 
at least the following information:</P>
<Blockquote>          - name, address, and contact information for the requesting party, including postal and email addresses;</P>
<P>          - the specific action of ICANN for which review or reconsideration is sought;</P>
<P>          - the date of the action;</P>
<P>          - the manner by which the requesting party will be affected by the action;</P>
<P>          - whether a temporary stay of the action is requested;</P>
<P>          - what specific steps the requesting party asks ICANN to take - i.e., whether and how the action should be reversed, cancelled, or modified;</P>
<P>          - the grounds on which the action should be reversed, cancelled, or modified;  and</P>
<P>          - any documents the requesting party wishes to submit in support of its request.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If a temporary stay of the action is requested, the requesting party 
should identify what harms will result if the action is not stayed.</P>

<P>The Reconsideration Committee will endeavor to complete its work and 
submit its recommendation to the Board within 30 days of the filing of the 
request;  its recommendations will be made public on the ICANN web site.  
The Board will not be bound to follow the recommendations of the Reconsideration 
Committee.  The final decision of the Board will be made public as part of the 
minutes of the Board meeting at which it was made.</P>

<P>To protect against abuse of the reconsideration process, a request for 
reconsideration may be dismissed by the Reconsideration Committee where it 
is repetitive, frivolous, non-substantive, or otherwise abusive, or where the 
affected party had an opportunity, but was unwilling, to participate in the 
public comment period relating to the contested action, if applicable.  Likewise, 
the Reconsideration Committee may dismiss a request when the requesting party has 
not shown that it will be "affected" by ICANN's action.</P>
