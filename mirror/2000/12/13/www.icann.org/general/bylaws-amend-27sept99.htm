<P>The following amendments to the ICANN Bylaws were approved unanimously by the 
  Initial Board of Directors on September 27, 1999. These amendments relate to 
  the election procedures by which ICANN's three Supporting Organizations will 
  select a total of nine Directors of the corporation. These amendments were proposed 
  by the ICANN staff in response to public comments and to apparent areas of confusion 
  about the Bylaws requirements for the SO election processes. The proposed amendments 
  were intended to clarify and, in several cases, modify the election procedures 
  established by the existing Bylaws.</P>
<P> In approving these amendments, the Initial Board noted the opposition of some 
  current members of the SO Councils, on the grounds that the proposed Article 
  VI, Section 4, was (i) not necessary and (ii) proposed only a few weeks before 
  the elections are to be held. On the merits, the Initial Board believed that 
  the amendments were essential for a fair, ethical, and transparent election 
  process. As to the timing of the proposal, the Board agreed that it would have 
  been better to adopt these amendments much earlier in the process. However, 
  the Board concluded that the temporary inconvenience that will be caused by 
  the amendments is outweighed by the importance of the principles at stake. In 
  order to make clear that no constituency group or standards development organization 
  will lose any of its voting strength due to the nomination of one of its SO 
  Council members as a candidate for the ICANN Board, the Initial Board adopted 
  a clarifying statement that the entity that selected the nominated SO Council 
  member will have the ability to name a replacement for purposes of the election.</P>
<P>The Board noted the opposition of several organizations and individuals to 
  the proposed amendment to Article V, Section 6 (see below), which specifies 
  that the minimum geographic representation requirement will be enforced through 
  the At-Large portion of the ICANN Board. </P>
<P>First, the objectors argued that this amendment might effectively mean that 
  some regions will go unrepresented until the At-Large Director elections, to 
  be held next year. The Initial Board agreed, but concluded that there is no 
  practical way to force a particular SO to elect a Director from a particular 
  region -- after all, there are five geographic regions and the SOs each elect 
  only three directors. The Initial Board felt that an effort to dictate specific 
  geographic regions would be inconsistent with the basic autonomy of each SO, 
  and would be nearly impossible to enforce. Instead, the Initial Board will apply 
  the requirement that at least one director be a citizen of each of the five 
  geographic regions by means of the At-Large elections.</P>
<P>Second, the objectors argued that the proposed deletion of the former clause 
  (3) of Article V, Section 6 (see below) would allow more than half of the Board 
  to be citizens of a single region. This objection reflects a misunderstanding 
  of how the geographic diversity provisions interoperate. </P>
<ul>
  <li>As to the At-Large Directors, the new Bylaws provision continues the rule 
    that no more than half of the At-Large Directors can be citizens of countries 
    in the same geographic region. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>As to the Directors elected by the Supporting Organizations, the net result 
    of the various applicable geographic diversity requirements -- which are set 
    forth in the ICANN Bylaws relating to the DNSO, in the ASO Memorandum of Understanding 
    (when completed), and the PSO Memorandum of Understanding -- is that no more 
    than four of the nine SO-elected Directors can be citizens of countries in 
    the same geographic region. </li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the Bylaws amendment maintains (and, indeed, strengthens) the overall 
  principle that no more than half of all ICANN Directors can be citizens of countries 
  in the same geographic region.</p>
