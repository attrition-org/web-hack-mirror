      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">On June 5, 1998, the United States Government
      published its <A HREF="white-paper-05jun98.htm">Statement
      of Policy, Management of Internet Names and Addresses</A>, 63
      Fed. Reg. 31741(1998) (commonly known as the &quot;White Paper&quot;),
      declaring the Government's policy to transition responsibility
      for functions involving the technical management of the Internet
      from the U.S. Government and its contractors to a private-sector,
      globally representative, non-profit, consensus-based organization.
      On November 25, 1998, the United States Department of Commerce
      (&quot;DOC&quot;) and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
      and Numbers (&quot;ICANN&quot;) entered a <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/general/icann-mou-25nov98.htm">Memorandum
      of Understanding</A> (&quot;MOU&quot;) formally recognizing ICANN
      as that organization and establishing a joint project under which
      ICANN and DOC agreed to design, develop, and test the mechanisms,
      methods, and procedures that should be in place and the steps
      necessary to transition the U.S. Government's technical management
      responsibilities to ICANN.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/general/icann-mou-25nov98.htm">MOU</A>
      provides for the joint project to run for approximately twenty-two
      months, through September 30, 2000. ICANN provided an initial
      status report to DOC on June 15, 1999; that report can be found
      at &lt;<A HREF="statusreport-15june99.htm">http://www.icann.org/general/statusreport-15june99.htm</A>&gt;.
      This report includes and updates the accomplishments since that

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The MOU provides that &quot;the Parties
      will jointly design, develop, and test the mechanisms, methods,
      and procedures that should be in place and the steps necessary
      to transition management responsibility for DNS functions now
      performed by, or on behalf of, the U.S. Government to a private-sector
      not-for-profit entity.&quot; The mechanisms, methods, and procedures
      developed were intended to &quot;achieve the transition without
      disrupting the functional operation of the Internet.&quot; Upon
      successful testing, the MOU stated &quot;management of the DNS
      will be transitioned to the mechanisms, methods, and procedures
      designed and developed in the DNS Project.&quot;</FONT></P>

      Toward Completion of Specified Tasks</U></FONT></H3>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The MOU sets forth nine specific tasks
      for which ICANN committed its resources as part of the joint
      project for the design, development, and testing of the mechanisms
      for post-transition private-sector technical management of the
      Internet. (It also provides, as a tenth task, that ICANN will
      collaborate with DOC on other activities as appropriate to achieve
      the purposes of the joint project, as agreed by the parties.)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The mechanisms in several of these tasks
      have been fully designed, developed, and tested, and are successfully
      operating to permit private-sector technical management. For
      other tasks, work is still underway. The following sets forth
      the MOU's description of each of the nine tasks and describes
      the progress made to date toward completion of that task:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><A NAME="Task1"></A><B><I><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Task 1</FONT></U><FONT
         FACE="Arial">:</FONT></I></B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"> Provide
        expertise and advice on private sector functions related to technical
        management of the DNS such as the policy and direction of the
        allocation of IP number blocks and coordination of the assignment
        of other Internet technical parameters as needed to maintain
        universal connectivity on the Internet.</FONT></I></P>
        <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Status of progress on task 1</FONT></U><FONT
         FACE="Arial">:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> Throughout the
        joint project, ICANN has contributed its technical advice and
        expertise on various aspects of private-sector management of
        the Internet domain-name system. To assist in this regard, at
        the beginning of 1999 ICANN entered a <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/general/usc-icann-transition-agreement.htm">transition
        agreement</A> with the University of Southern California's Information
        Sciences Institute (ISI), under which ICANN secured the services
        of the IANA team at ISI.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Additionally, ICANN has made good use of
        other expertise in the Internet technical community to contribute
        to this task. Reliable, timely, and fair allocation of IP addresses
        and protocol parameters is a key requirement for the continued
        stable operation of the Internet and for its growth and evolution
        to satisfy the ever-increasing and ever-changing demands that
        its success is generating. At the time the DOC-ICANN MOU was
        entered, these functions were performed by the <A HREF="http://www.iana.org/">IANA</A>
        (a set of functions undertaken by personnel of the University
        of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute) in coordination
        with the <A HREF="http://www.aso.icann.org/rirs/">regional Internet
        registries</A> (RIRs) and Internet standards-development organizations
        (SDOs). Thus, a key aspect of the DNS Project was to devise and
        implement stable relationships with those existing organizations,
        so that the organizations are integrated into ICANN's overall
        technical-policy-coordination function. These organizations have
        extensive expertise in the address and protocol policy arenas
        that is vital to effective functioning of the ICANN policy-development
        process in these technical areas; similarly, smooth implementation
        requires their cooperation in abiding by the resulting policies.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the last half of 1999, ICANN entered
        into memoranda of understanding with the RIRs and SDOs. These
        agreements set forth the ongoing roles of those organizations
        in the ICANN policy-development process, so that the development
        and implementation of global addressing and protocol-parameter
        assignment policies through the ICANN process benefit from their
        full cooperation. Specifically, the ICANN <A HREF="http://www.pso.icann.org/">&quot;Protocol
        Supporting Organization&quot;</A> (PSO) was formed on July 14,
        1999, through the entry of a Memorandum of Understanding signed
        by representatives of ICANN and four standards-development organizations:
        the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), World Wide Web Consortium
        (W3C), International Telecommunications Union (ITU), and European
        Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). &lt;<A HREF="http://www.icann.org/pso/pso-mou.htm">http://www.icann.org/pso/pso-mou.htm</A>&gt;
        On October 18, 1999, the ICANN <A HREF="http://www.aso.icann.org/">&quot;Address
        Supporting Organization&quot;</A> (ASO) was formed through the
        entry of a Memorandum of Understanding signed by representatives
        of ICANN and the world's three current regional internet registries:
        APNIC, ARIN, and RIPE NCC. &lt;<A HREF="http://www.aso.icann.org/docs/aso-mou.html">http://www.aso.icann.org/docs/aso-mou.html</A>&gt;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">These memoranda of understanding establish
        the ASO and PSO as the bodies primarily responsible for formulating
        address and protocol policy recommendations within the ICANN
        process.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The ASO is managed by an <A HREF="http://www.aso.icann.org/ac/">Address
        Council</A> composed of members selected by the RIRs through
        open and transparent processes. The Address Council has been
        in active operation since October 1999 and the ASO's first general
        assembly was held in May 2000. In October 1999, the Address Council
        <A HREF="http://www.aso.icann.org/board/">selected three directors</A>
        by vote who have since served on ICANN's Board of Directors.
        Since then, the Address Council has been working both on its
        own procedures for developing global address policy recommendations
        and on current address-policy issues, such as guidelines for
        creation and recognition of new RIRs and the definition of the
        division between global address-policy issues (handled directly
        by the ICANN process) and regional address-policy issues (delegated
        to the RIRs).</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The PSO also voted to select three directors
        to ICANN's Board in October 1999. Since then, ICANN has been
        working to strengthen its operational relationships with the
        SDOs that are PSO members. On March 10, 2000, ICANN and the IETF
        entered a <A HREF="ietf-icann-mou-01mar00.htm">Memorandum
        of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the Internet
        Assigned Numbers Authority</A>, under which the IETF has appointed
        ICANN to perform the protocol-parameter assignment functions
        arising from the technical Internet standards developed by the
        IETF. The ICANN-IETF memorandum of understanding contemplates
        that ICANN may perform similar services for other SDOs so that
        the technical development of the Internet has a convenient, single
        repository for the assignment of parameters under technical standards.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In sum, ICANN has achieved stable relationships
        with the Internet SDOs and the RIRs. These relationships allow
        those organizations to continue their technical work in their
        respective areas of activity, while bringing them together within
        the ICANN process to formulate policies that span the areas of
        activity of multiple organizations. Significant collaborative
        work is ongoing between ICANN (including its ASO) and the RIRs
        on issues such as the appropriate allocation of responsibilities
        for address policy formulation and implementation between regional
        and global forums. One area not yet completed is the establishment
        of formal legal relationships under which the RIRs will contribute
        to ICANN's costs of operation. The RIRs have each agreed to a
        contribution for the current fiscal year which, collectively
        among all three RIRs, comprises 10% of ICANN's general costs,
        but contractual documents memorializing this commitment have
        not yet been completed. With this exception, the design, implementation,
        and successful testing of these sound interrelationships among
        the Internet's key technical standards and IP-address-assignment
        bodies fulfills the requirements of Task 1 of the DOC-ICANN joint
        project.</FONT></P>

        three principal mechanisms have been designed and developed for
        addressing claims by members of the Internet community that they
        have been adversely affected by decisions in conflict with ICANN's
        bylaws:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">a. <U>Reconsideration process</U>. On March
          4, 1999, ICANN adopted a <A HREF="reconsideration.htm">reconsideration
          policy</A> under which members of the Internet community affected
          by actions of the ICANN staff or Board can seek reconsideration
          of those actions by the Board. Requests for reconsideration are
          addressed first by a reconsideration committee consisting of
          three ICANN directors, which investigates as appropriate and
          makes recommendations to the ICANN board. Approximately ten such
          requests have been received and acted on; while most did not
          involve allegations that ICANN's bylaws had been violated, the
          process has on occasion been used to raise such complaints.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">b. <U>Independent review process</U>. On
          March 10, 2000, ICANN adopted an <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/indreview/policy.htm">independent
          review policy</A>. Under the policy, a panel consisting of legally
          trained persons (e.g., current and former judges) not holding
          any office or position within the ICANN structure will consider
          complaints that the ICANN Board has acted or failed to act in
          a manner contrary to ICANN's Articles of Incorporation and/or
          Bylaws. The formation of a committee to nominate members of the
          independent review panel is currently underway by the various
          ICANN Supporting Organizations.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">c. <U>Arbitration process</U>. In the domain-name
          arena, ICANN policies are mainly implemented through ICANN's
          entry of agreements with domain-name registries and registrars.
          Many of these agreements include provisions paralleling protections
          in ICANN's bylaws concerning open and transparent policymaking,
          fostering of competition, and prohibitions of arbitrary or unjustifiable
          action. They also include arbitration provisions, which give
          the parties contracting with ICANN access to a neutral decisionmaker
          to resolve questions under these provisions.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In sum, the design of multiple mechanisms
        for neutral review of ICANN's compliance with its bylaws is complete.
        Although one of the mechanisms is in the implementation phase,
        the others are in place and, in the case of the reconsideration
        process, extensively tested. Task 2 is thus well underway and
        should be completed within the next few months.</FONT></P>

        of ICANN's work under the joint project during the first three
        quarters of 1999 was devoted to this task, which is now complete.
        In January-March 1999, in consultation with DOC (which had laid
        the groundwork by entering <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/nsi/coopagmt-amend11-07oct98.htm">Amendment
        11</A> to the U.S. Government's cooperative agreement with Network
        Solutions, Inc.), ICANN developed and adopted a <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/registrars/ra-agreement-12may99.htm">registrar
        accreditation policy</A> for the .com, .net, and .org top-level
        domains.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">That initial policy, which incorporated
        various requirements for accredited registrars to permit robust
        competition at the registrar level while preserving stable operation
        of these top-level domains, led to the <A HREF="../announcements/icann-pr21apr99.htm">April
        1999 designation</A> of five registrars to participate in a testbed.
        Actual live operations under the testbed began in June 1999.
        After initial operation of the testbed with the five registrars,
        it was extended to other registrars. At the end of November 1999,
        the testbed was concluded.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The registrar accreditation policy has
        been subject to refinement through subsequent discussions within
        the Internet community, which resulted in a <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/nsi/icann-raa-04nov99.htm">revised
        set of agreements</A> approved by the ICANN Board at its annual
        meeting on November 4, 1999 and in further revisions by the adoption
        of an interim <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/nsi/registry-sla-05apr00.htm">registry
        service level agreement</A> in April 2000. Ongoing competitive
        operations by approximately fifty registrars are now underway,
        with an additional sixty accredited registrars in the process
        of developing their business systems to enter the market. In
        less than one year since testbed operations began, the share
        of net new registrations attributable to Network Solutions (the
        sole registrar since 1993) has dropped from 100% to under 50%.
        Over the same period, retail registration pricing has dropped
        from $35 per year to as little as $10 per year, with some registrars
        even offering domain-name registration &quot;free&quot; as part
        of larger service packages.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thus, while the constantly changing character
        of the Internet merits periodic review of the accreditation program,
        a plan for introduction of competition has been designed, developed,
        and tested in fulfillment of this task.</FONT></P>

         FACE="Arial">:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> In view of ICANN's
        fundamental character as a consensus-based technical-coordination
        body, the design of mechanisms for affected parties to participate
        in the formulation of policies concerning the Internet's technical
        management has been a central and continuing focus of the joint
        project since its inception. Many different mechanisms have been
        designed, developed, and tested. The different mechanisms tested
        have, in practice, shown different strengths and weaknesses;
        the refinement of participatory mechanisms likely will be a ongoing
        feature of ICANN's design.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">One of the challenges in the design of
        participatory mechanisms is that, in view of ICANN's non-governmental
        character, many of the mechanisms used in governmental policy-making
        are too cumbersome to meet the needs of the ICANN process. Moreover,
        ICANN lacks any governmental power to compel compliance with
        its policies. ICANN's policies instead will be implemented only
        to the extent that those in a position to do so (registrars,
        ISPs, etc.) in fact implement them, either by previous agreement
        or otherwise. Given this circumstance, bottom-up participation
        by the implementing parties in policy formulation, in circumstances
        where it is practical, has an advantage over mechanisms traditionally
        used by governments because bottom-up mechanisms tend to ensure
        that resulting policies are widely embraced by the implementers.
        On the other hand, experience to date under the joint project
        has indicated that fully bottom-up mechanisms can require extended
        periods to reach resolution.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Some of the major mechanisms already evaluated,
        currently being evaluated, or under design for evaluation, in
        the joint project are:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">a. <U>Notice-and-comment mechanisms</U>.
          ICANN's bylaws provide for <A HREF="bylaws.htm#III-3">notice
          and public comment</A> (both in writing and at a public forum)
          on any policies that substantially affect the operation of the
          Internet or third parties. During the joint project ICANN has
          developed and implemented various methods for electronic publication
          of policy proposals and for electronic collection of comments
          from affected parties and the public generally. In addition to
          e-mail based mechanisms (mailing lists and mail-in bulletin boards),
          ICANN has developed software to support web-based comment mechanisms
          that are in active use.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">b. <U>Address and Protocol Supporting Organizations</U>.
          In the areas of IP-addressing and protocol policy, organizations
          (RIRs and SDOs) existing prior to ICANN employed their own processes
          for policy formulation. The ASO and PSO make good use of their
          member organizations' processes by referring most address- and
          protocol-policy issues, at least in the first instance, to those
          organizations. To the extent particular policy issues are not
          appropriately resolved at the member-organization level, the
          ASO and PSO offer additional forums for participation by other
          member organizations and by the Internet community generally.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">c. <U>Domain Name Supporting Organization
          (DNSO)</U>. In the case of domain-name policy, community sentiment
          at the beginning of the joint project indicated that the supporting
          organization for domain-name issues should be formed anew, rather
          than seeking to incorporate existing policy-development organizations.
          In March 1999, at the ICANN meeting in Singapore, the Internet
          community presented a consensus proposal, based on which the
          ICANN Board adopted a &quot;<A HREF="http://www.icann.org/dnso-formation.html">Statement
          of Domain Name Supporting Organization Formation Concepts</A>.&quot;
          Under this statement of concepts, seven constituencies of Internet
          stakeholders were self-organized. Later in 1999, they were provisionally
          recognized by the ICANN Board and the <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/dnso/dnso.htm">DNSO</A>
          began operating. After five months of operation, the DNSO and
          its constituencies were accorded final recognition.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Within its design, the DNSO has many opportunities
          for bottom-up participation in the policy-formulation process.
          As noted, a principal feature of the DNSO's structure is the
          seven interest-based constituency organizations. In addition
          to choosing representatives to the DNSO Names Council (which
          has overall responsibility for managing the policy-development
          process within the DNSO), each constituency organization serves
          as a forum for its members to raise and debate issues of mutual
          interest, whether initially raised within the constituency or
          developed by another DNSO body. The Names Council has also chartered
          several working groups, which are charged to do preliminary evaluations
          of issues or proposals in focused policy areas. Working groups
          conduct their business primarily by <A HREF="http://www.dnso.icann.org/listsdnso.html">e-mail</A>.
          Finally, the DNSO embraces a general assembly as a forum for
          discussion and participation in the work of the DNSO open to
          all who are willing to contribute effort to the work of the DNSO.
          In support of this forum, the DNSO hosts a mailing list and periodically
          holds meetings of DNSO participants.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">d. <U>Contractual consensus requirements</U>.
          Because policies developed through the ICANN process can only
          be implemented by agreement of businesses in a position to do
          so (registry operators, registrars, etc.), ICANN has entered
          into agreements with those businesses under which they agree
          to implement various present or future policies. In many aspects,
          these agreements establish that the businesses will follow future
          policies created through the ICANN consensus-development process.
          These provisions have prompted consensus-based policy development
          efforts within particular constituencies, such as the registrar
          constituency.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">e. <U>Working groups, task forces, drafting
          committees, etc</U>. As noted above, the DNSO has made active
          use of working groups as participatory mechanisms for preliminary
          evaluations of policy issues or proposals in the domain-name
          area. In addition, ICANN has adopted the practice in its budgeting
          process of convening a task force consisting of representatives
          of organizations that provide the funds for defraying ICANN's
          operating costs. At times, ICANN has also convened small groups
          drawn from various segments of the Internet community to advise
          ICANN's staff on the implementation of various policies.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">f. <U>Delegation of policy formulation
          to specialized consensus-based groups, such as top-level domain
          sponsors</U>. A longstanding feature of Internet coordination
          is the delegation of most aspects of policy formulation to local,
          regional, or other bodies that themselves have participatory
          mechanisms. For example, most aspects of IP addressing policy
          are established by the RIRs, which each have policy forums in
          which affected members of the Internet communities in their regions
          can participate. In the domain-name arena, the hierarchical structure
          of the domain-name system lends itself well to a similar delegation
          of policy responsibilities. For example, the local aspects of
          policy within country-code top-level domains are established
          by the organizations to which management of those domains are
          delegated. Increasingly, those delegations are held by organizations
          broadly representative of the Internet communities in their respective
          countries or territories. These delegation arrangements work
          well to afford the most affected stakeholders focused participation
          in development of specialized or local policies.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">With respect to the design of appropriate
        mechanisms for affected segments of the Internet community to
        participate in the issues concerning the management and delegation
        of ccTLDs, significant work remains to be completed. Various
        segments of the community, including the <A HREF="../gac/gac.htm">Governmental
        Advisory Committee</A>, various groups of ccTLD managers, and
        others have submitted <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/yokohama/cctld-topic.htm">position
        papers</A> for discussion within the ICANN process. It is anticipated
        that the ensuing discussion will result in agreements or other
        documents that will better define the relationships of the ccTLD
        managers, relevant governments and other public authorities,
        and ICANN. Completion of this design should be a high priority
        under the joint project.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In sum, many different participatory mechanisms
        have been designed, developed, and tested under task 6. In the
        context of private-sector technical management of the Internet,
        the goal of achieving timely resolution of policy issues with
        the participation of affected parties is and will continue to
        be challenging. Based on the work to date under the joint project,
        it appears that the goal is best addressed by use of a varied
        and evolving array of participatory mechanisms. Although the
        mechanisms designed, developed, and tested to date each have
        strengths and weaknesses, and will no doubt continue to evolve
        over time, in combination they now provide a range of channels
        that can suit most policy development needs. Accordingly, although
        there will likely always be room for enhancement of participatory
        mechanisms, as contemplated in task 6 a robust initial set of
        mechanisms has been developed and tested with respect to issues
        other than the management and delegation of ccTLDs.</FONT></P>

        mechanisms, including bylaw requirements and operational practices
        for postings on its website as well as for the other mechanisms.

        will result in the selection and seating later this year of five
        directors based on a vote of members of the Internet community
        that have registered for that purpose. Currently, over 28,000
        members have applied to become registered. An initial group of
        at-large directors selected by these members of the Internet

      <H3><A NAME="D"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">D. <U>Steps Required for
      Completion of the Joint Project</U></FONT></H3>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As can be seen from the above summary,
      most tasks are either completed in design, development, and testing,
      or are in the implementation and testing phase.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The major focus of efforts under the joint
      project is now on those areas where design and development aspects
      are still uncompleted: implementation of root-server system enhancements
      and development of stable and appropriate funding and other relationships
      with operators of country-code top-level domains. Significantly,
      these two areas are related, due to the fact that country-code
      organizations rely on the stability of their delegations within
      the root-server system.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">To help address these issues, the following
      immediate steps would be appropriate:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">1. The RSSAC recommendations, when received,
        should be finally reviewed by DOC and ICANN to ensure that the
        root-server-system security issues have been properly addressed.
        Implementation of the final recommendations should then begin
        promptly. DOC and ICANN should also enter into an agreement that
        provides for ICANN's day-to-day operation and coordination of
        the root-server system. Such an agreement, possibly modeled on
        Amendment 11 to the Network Solutions cooperative agreement,
        should preserve existing arrangements concerning authority for
        ultimate approvals in the context of the new operational regime.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">2. Consistent with the results of the ongoing
        discussions within the Internet community, ICANN should continue
        its efforts to achieve agreements with the organizations operating
        country-code top-level domains which cover delegation and redelegation
        issues; allocation of global and local policy-formulation responsibility;
        the relationship among the ccTLD operator, the relevant national
        government and ICANN; and the ccTLD operator's contribution to
        ICANN's funding.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">3. As ICANN reaches appropriate and stable
        agreements concerning ccTLDs with their managers, DOC and ICANN
        should agree on simplified procedures that enable ICANN to assure
        those ccTLD managers that the authoritative root will point to
        the ccTLD nameservers they designate for so long as the agreements
        remain in effect.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">4. Since it appears that all of the continuing
        tasks under the joint project may not be completed by the current
        termination date of the MOU, the MOU should be extended until
        all the conditions required to complete full transition to ICANN
        are accomplished.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
