        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
        (the IANA), as part of the administrative functions associated
        with management of the domain-name system root, is responsible
        for receiving requests for delegation and redelegation of top-level
        domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent to those requests,
        and reporting on the requests. In early 1997, the IANA received
        a request for delegation of a top-level domain for Palestine.
        That request was initially declined, but was renewed in October
        1999. This report gives the findings and conclusions of the IANA
        on its investigation of these requests.</FONT></P>

         FACE="Arial">Factual and Procedural Background</FONT></B></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In February 1997, the IANA received inquiries
        about the possibility of delegating a country-code top-level
        domain (ccTLD) for Palestine.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Country-code top-level domains in the Internet
        domain-name system are designated by two-letter codes (&quot;alpha-2
        codes&quot;) shown on the <A HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1.html">ISO
        3166-1 list</A> maintained by the <A HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/index.html">ISO
        3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA)</A>. That list consists
        of codes given in the UN Bulletin &quot;Country Names&quot; and
        in the code list of the &quot;Standard Country or Area Codes
        for Statistical Use.&quot; There is also provision for assignment
        of codes by the Maintenance Agency in certain limited circumstances
        in response to a request of the affected national government
        or national standards body. The ISO 3166-1 list is used worldwide
        in many applications involving coded information concerning names
        of countries and of physically separated dependent territories.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">At the time of the 1997 inquiries, no code
        for Palestine was included on the ISO 3166-1 list. Instead, in
        November 1995 the United Nations Statistics Division had included
        the name &quot;Palestine&quot; on an interim list of area names
        and, in response, the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency agreed to set
        aside the alpha-2 code &quot;ps&quot; to represent the name &quot;Palestine&quot;
        in the event a later decision was made to include Palestine on
        the ISO 3166-1 list. In practical effect, such a reservation
        means that the code reserved should not be used to refer to any
        other country, territory, or region. In April 1996 the Maintenance
        Agency formally moved the &quot;ps&quot; code to its <A HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/reserved.html">list
        of reserved code elements</A> under the category of &quot;exceptional
        reservations.&quot; At that time, it did not assign the &quot;ps&quot;
        code to Palestine on the ISO 3166-1 list.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Because no code for Palestine was then
        on the ISO 3166-1 list, in May 1997, the IANA declined to delegate
        a ccTLD to Palestine.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In April 1998 the IANA indicated that it
        would delegate the second-level domain &quot;palestine.int,&quot;
        based on Palestine's Status as a Permanent Observer to the United
        Nations. The IANA noted that this registration was to be &quot;in
        lieu of a current top level domain for Palestine and would eventually
        be transferred to the top level domain when the TLD is accepted
        by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Dr Ghassan Z. Qadah, the Supervisor-General
        of the <A HREF="http://www.gov.palestine.int/gcc/default.htm">Government
        Computer Center</A> in Palestine as well as the Senior Advisor
        for Technology to the Palestine Ministry of Planning and International
        Cooperation, was proposed to become the designated administrative
        contact for palestine.int. On 14 May 1998, after investigation
        showed overwhelming community support for this appointment, the
        IANA delegated palestine.int, with Dr Qadah named as administrative
        contact and Dr Yaser Dolah named as technical contact. The palestine.int
        domain has been in operation since, being used in a limited way
        for a governmental-purposes third-level domain (gov.palestine.int).</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In summer 1999, the United Nations Statistics
        Division notified the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency that it had
        included &quot;Occupied Palestinian Territory&quot; on the United
        Nations list of Standard Country and Area Codes for Statistical
        Use. On 30 September 1999, the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency <A
        HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/new10_99.html">announced</A>
        that effective 1 October 1999 it was adding the alpha-2 code
        &quot;ps&quot; to the ISO 3166-1 list to designate &quot;Occupied
        Palestinian Territory.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">On 11 October 1999, Drs Qadah and Doleh
        applied to the IANA for delegation of the .ps top-level domain.
        Dr Qadah is a computer scientist with a specialty in database
        algorithms and, as noted above, has headed the Government Computer
        Center for the Palestinian Authority for several years. Dr Doleh,
        who resides in New York State, USA, holds a PhD in computer science
        from Kent State and has done work in system-independent user
        interfaces.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">On 2 February 2000, Dr Nabeel Shaath, Minister
        of Planning &amp; International Cooperation of the Palestinian
        Authority, wrote to the IANA stating that his ministry and the
        Government Computer Center had been entrusted with receiving,
        managing, operating, and regulating the Palestinian top-level
        domain.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The IANA has conducted a follow-up to its
        earlier investigation of the proposed managers, including a review
        of the Government Computer Center's plans to establish the Palestinian
        Network Information Center to manage the .ps top-level domain.
        The IANA finds the plan to be technically sound and to be well-suited
        to meet the needs of academic, commercial, governmental, and
        other existing and future Internet users in Palestine. The Government
        Computer Center is the only information-technology planning unit
        in Palestine, having led the Y2K campaign there, and has contributed
        substantially to making the Internet available in Palestine.
        The IANA's follow-up investigation turned up nothing to show
        a diminution in the previously observed community support for
        the applicants serving as trustees for the community as designated
        managers of a domain for Palestine.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">This report is being provided under the
        9 February 2000 <A HREF="iana-contract-09feb00.htm">contract
        for performance of the IANA function</A> between the United States
        Government and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
        Numbers. Under that contract, the IANA is responsible for receiving
        delegation requests, investigating the circumstances pertinent
        to those requests, and reporting on the requests.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The policies currently followed in connection
        with the delegation of Internet top-level domains are summarized
        in &quot;Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation&quot;
        (<A HREF="../icp/icp-1.htm">ICP-1</A>), which
        was issued in May 1999 to reflect &quot;the current policies
        being followed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
        in administering delegations of Top Level Domain Names of the
        Internet Domain Names System (DNS).&quot; ICP-1 represents an
        update of the portions of <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt">RFC
        1591</A> (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs,
        to reflect evolution of the policies followed by the IANA through
        May 1999. Although there is ongoing consideration within the
        ICANN process of proposals for changes in policies concerning
        ccTLDs, no significant policies have yet been adopted that are
        at variance with ICP-1.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The delegation request raises two principal
        issues: (a) should a .ps ccTLD be delegated and, (b) if so, are
        the proposed managers the appropriate ones.</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><A NAME="A"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">A. <U>The .ps top-level
          domain should be delegated</U>.</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">A threshold issue is whether a .ps top-level
        should be delegated at all, in view of Palestine's special status.
        This issue is answered by <A HREF="../icp/icp-1.htm#i">section
        (i) of ICP-1</A>, which makes the <A HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1.html">ISO
        3166-1 table</A> the authoritative reference as to which ccTLDs
        are subject to delegation. Assessments regarding sovereignty
        and nationhood are not among the IANA's functions. Indeed, many
        of the alpha-2 codes included on the ISO 3166-1 list, for which
        ccTLDs have been established and delegated, are plainly not &quot;countries&quot;
        at all, but are instead dependencies of other countries. Examples
        include <A HREF="http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/hm.html">Heard
        Island and McDonald Islands</A> (.hm) (a territory of Australia),
        <A HREF="http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/nt.html">Netherlands
        Antilles</A> (.an) (part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands),
        and <A HREF="http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rq.html">Puerto
        Rico</A> (.pr) (a commonwealth associated with the US). A top-level
        domain for <A HREF="http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/ay.html">Antarctica</A>
        (.aq), which also appears on the ISO 3166-1 list, has also been
        established and delegated.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Because the IANA is not in the business
        of assessing whether or not particular areas are &quot;countries,&quot;
        the policy set forth in ICP-1 and RFC 1591 for delegation matters
        has been to avoid political considerations and simply refer to
        the ISO 3166-1 list as an independent source of two-letter abbreviations
        for countries and areas. The ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency, in
        determining which countries and areas should be provided codes
        on the ISO 3166-1 list, looks to two other lists provided by
        the <A HREF="http://www.un.org/Depts/unsd/methods/m49.htm">United
        Nations Statistics Division</A>. As <A HREF="http://www.un.org/Depts/unsd/methods/m49alpha.htm">noted</A>
        by the Statistics Division in connection with its listing of
        countries and areas: &quot;The designations employed and the
        presentation of country or area names in this list do not imply
        the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the Secretariat
        of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country,
        territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning
        the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.&quot; Thus,
        it is well-settled under current delegation policy that issues
        about the legal status of a listed entry on the ISO 3166-1 list
        are not pertinent to whether a ccTLD should be established and
        delegated.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">After over two years of deliberations,
        the United Nations Statistics Division and the ISO 3166 Maintenance
        Agency have determined that a code should be provided for the
        Occupied Palestinian Territory, and the code .ps code has been
        added to the ISO 3166-1 list. Thus, a crucial change in circumstances
        has occurred since this matter first arose in early 1997. Then,
        although .ps was included as an &quot;exceptional reservation&quot;
        for possible future inclusion on the ISO 3166-1 code list, it
        was not actually included on that list. The IANA's policy is
        to delegate ccTLDs only from the ISO 3166-1 list, so that in
        1997 .ps did not meet that requirement for delegation. The ISO
        3166-1 list now includes .ps, and accordingly that code now qualifies
        for delegation as a ccTLD.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(A few of the currently delegated ccTLDs
        do not appear on the ISO 3166-1 list. The United Kingdom was
        assigned the <A HREF="http://www.nominet.net/nominet/intro.html">ccTLD
        .uk</A> in the <A HREF="http://www.networksolutions.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois?!UK-DOM">mid-1980s</A>
        even though ISO 3166-1 calls for use of .gb. This assignment
        occurred before the IANA began using any standard list of country-code
        abbreviations. During a brief period in 1996, the IANA followed
        the policy of delegating ccTLDs not only from the ISO 3166-1
        list but also from codes the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency had
        reserved specifically for purposes of the Universal Postal Union.
        That policy proved unsatisfactory and was quickly abandoned in
        favor of strict adherence to the ISO 3166-1 list. Finally, a
        few ccTLDs that were established from the ISO 3166-1 list were
        later deleted from that list. An example is the ccTLD for Zaire,
        .zr.)<BR>

        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">A fundamental principle reflected in ICP-1
        is that ccTLDs are intended to be operated for the benefit of
        the Internet community in the nation or other territory with
        which the country-code is associated. As Dr Postel wrote in RFC
        1591 (and as <A HREF="../icp/icp-1.htm#b">reiterated
        in ICP-1</A>):</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The designated manager is the trustee of
          the top-level domain for both the nation, in the case of a country

          and &quot;ownership&quot; of domains are inappropriate. It is
          appropriate, however, to be concerned about &quot;responsibilities&quot;
          and &quot;service&quot; to the community.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thus, in ccTLD-delegation matters, the
        IANA seeks input from persons concerned or affected by the transfer,

        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICP-1 gives the <A HREF="../icp/icp-1.htm#a">following
        guidance</A> concerning requirements for delegation of a ccTLD:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(a) Delegation of a New Top Level Domain.
          Delegation of a new top level domain requires the completion
          of a number of procedures, including the identification of a
          TLD manager with the requisite skills and authority to operate
          the TLD appropriately. The desires of the government of a country
          with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously.
          The IANA will make them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer
          discussions. Significantly interested parties in the domain should
          agree that the proposed TLD manager is the appropriate party.
          The key requirement is that for each domain there be a designated
          manager for supervising that domain's name space. In the case
          of ccTLDs, this means that there is a manager that supervises
          the domain names and operates the domain name system in that
          country. There must be Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to
          the nameservers and electronic mail connectivity to the entire
          management, staff, and contacts of the manager. There must be
          an administrative contact and a technical contact for each domain.
          The administrative contact must reside in the country involved
          for ccTLDs. . . .</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Here, Drs Qadah and Doleh possess the skills
        and authority to operate the .ps TLD appropriately. Both are
        accomplished computer scientists. They have operated the palestine.int
        domain competently. Dr Qadah is Supervisor-General of the Government
        Computer Center and has obtained the authority to commit that
        organization's resources to providing reliable nameservice for
        the ccTLD. The Palestinian Authority has given its support to
        his operation of the ccTLD. Dr Qadah and the Government Computer
        Center have contributed significantly to development of the Internet
        in Palestine, and their assuming stewardship over the domain
        should further promote availability and use of the Internet in
        Palestine. This has earned them support from the Internet community
        in Palestine, as well as the strong support of the Palestinian
        Authority.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The IANA is satisfied that Drs Qadah and
        Doleh recognize the solemn nature of the trust they seek to assume
        and that they intend to operate the .ps ccTLD in the interest
        of both the Internet community in Palestine and those throughout
        the world who are or may in the future be affected by the operation
        of the .ps TLD. In this regard, the IANA notes that Dr Qadah
        has indicated that the Government Computer Center and the Palestinian
        Authority will work with ICANN in accordance with global norms
        and regulations.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The IANA has verified IP connectivity to
