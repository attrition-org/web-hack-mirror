<p><font face="Arial">A set of proposed amendments to the existing ICANN Bylaws 
  has been posted for public review and comment. The proposed amendments include 
  (1) amendments implementing the resolution on At Large Membership adopted by 
  the Board in Santiago; (2) amendments implementing the ASO proposal recognized 
  in Santiago (subject to the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding by ICANN, 
  ARIN, APNIC, and RIPE-NCC); (3) a redefinition of the term "Initial Board" to 
  provide that once SO-elected directors are seated the entire Board -- including 
  the SO-elected directors -- is responsible for all future decisions of the Board; 
  and (4) various clarifying and editorial changes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Because they are intended to implement prior Board resolutions 
  and to faciliate the transition to a Board of elected Directors, these amendments 
  are appropriate for action by the Initial Board and will be posted for public 
  review and comment for two weeks, until October 22, 1999. The Initial Board 
  will take them up in a telephone meeting shortly thereafter.</font></p>
