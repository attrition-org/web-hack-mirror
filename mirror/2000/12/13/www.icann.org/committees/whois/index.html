        <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To the .com/.net/.org
        Whois committee:</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, let me thank
        each of you for agreeing to help on reviewing the various issues
        concerning implementation of the Whois requirements embodied
        in the current agreements with registrars for the .com, .net,
        and .org TLDs.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I understand that
        in some respects your discussions of the current Whois service
        requirements have led the committee to conclude that some new
        approaches to providing Whois services (and some new policies)
        should be considered.&nbsp; For example, I understand that you
        have been discussing some changes to the terms for access to
        Whois data that are embodied in the current agreements.&nbsp;
        To the extent that the committee, or any other group of stakeholders,
        feels that some policy additions/changes should be considered,
        it is of course appropriate and helpful to the consensus-based
        process to make those views, and any supporting analysis, available
        to the Internet community.&nbsp; I encourage the committee (or
        any of you individually) to prepare a detailed report on any
        policy extensions you feel are appropriate.&nbsp; As stated at
        the committee's inception, the ICANN staff intends to refer any
        such report to the DNSO (and, if protocol matters are involved,
        the PSO) for consideration of whether policy changes or additions
        should be recommended.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The primary purpose
        of this committee, however, is to generate some advice on specific
        issues that have arisen in the implementation of existing Whois
        provision for registrars in the .com, .net, and .org TLDs.&nbsp;
        To assist the committee in giving focused feedback on the staff's
        implementation of the existing agreements, I have prepared the
        following list of specific questions.&nbsp; It would be very
        helpful to me if the committee would give its feedback to these
        questions in a separate document from any report you might prepare
        on policy additions/changes that should be considered.&nbsp;
        This will make it easier to determine which portions of the committee's
        feedback are intended for use by the ICANN staff and which portions
        are appropriately referred to a supporting organization.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An overall goal
        of the Whois provisions of the Registrar Accreditation Agreements
        was to help restore the InterNIC Whois service that existed in
        .com, .net, and .org prior to the introduction of multiple registrars.&nbsp;
        This service is described in Section 6.4 of <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1580.txt">RFC
        1580</A> (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/fyi/fyi23.txt">FYI

        <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the advent
        of multiple, competitive registrars in .com, .net, and .org,
        contact data on domain-name holders was broken up into separate
        databases maintained by each sponsoring registrar.&nbsp; As a
        result, searches that were previously possible (e.g., a search
        for all .com/.net/.org entries that reference a particular person)
        were no longer possible on a TLD-wide basis.&nbsp; The approach
        of the agreements was to require, as an immediate measure, the
        provision of Whois service from each registrar's database (<A
        HREF="http://www.icann.org/nsi/icann-raa-04nov99.htm#IIF1">subsection
        II.F.1</A>), and to provide a pathway toward restoration of a
        TLD-wide Whois capability.</FONT></P>
        <P><A NAME="ImplementationIssues"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Implementation
        Issues</FONT></B></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Implementing this
        approach has presented significant problems.&nbsp; With a few
        exceptions, most registrars have simply implemented a domain-name-lookup
        capability, rather than the full features of Whois described
        in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1580.txt">RFC 1580</A>.&nbsp;
        These deficiencies have been aggravated by the differences in
        the format and other details implemented by registrars; these
        differences have made it difficult for registrars to provide
        even a consistent TLD-wide domain-name-lookup service.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To move toward achieving
        the goals of the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (or, as some
        would put it, fixing the now-broken Whois), it appears that efforts
        should be made to remedy these problems.&nbsp; This effort, of
        course, should be done in a manner that minimizes the burdens
        on registrars, which are (quite properly) occupied with competing
        to meet the many facets of registration-market demand.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ICANN staff could
        benefit from the committee's views on the following implementation
        issues:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><A NAME="Implementation-1"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1.&nbsp;
          Should registrars provide Whois replies in a standard format?&nbsp;
          Currently, registrars use a wide variety of formats for Whois
          responses.&nbsp; If a standard format were employed, it would
          simplify the efforts of registrars to provide a seamless, TLD-wide,
          domain-name-lookup capability.&nbsp; While this would not satisfy
          the long-delayed goal of restoring full TLD-wide Whois service,
          it would at least ameliorate the delay in achieving that goal.</FONT></P>
          <P><A NAME="Implementation-2"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.&nbsp;
          If a standard format is to be encouraged, what should it be?</FONT></P>

          If registrars provide supplementary data in response to Whois
          queries, how should it appear in the overall format?&nbsp; (Some
          registrars, for example, provide an indication that the domain
          name is subject to a UDRP proceeding.)</FONT></P>
          <P><A NAME="Implementation-4"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4.&nbsp;
          Should registrars be permitted to limit the number of queries

          all active SLD registrations,&quot; indicating that limitations
          on the number of queries are not contemplated.&nbsp; The use
          of governors, however, can prevent inappropriate heavy loading
          of a registrar's Whois systems.&nbsp; The ICANN staff would benefit
          from guidance as to the extent to which it should, as a matter

          registrars in implementing TLD-wide domain-name-lookup service.&nbsp;
          Should limitations on this access be permitted, even if governors

          for true &quot;Whois&quot; service.&nbsp; However, prior to implementation
          of the TLD-wide Whois service contemplated by <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/nsi/icann-raa-04nov99.htm#IIF4">subsection
          II.F.4</A>, registrar-by-registrar Whois service appears to be
          of limited value.&nbsp; Would it be better to avoid burdening
