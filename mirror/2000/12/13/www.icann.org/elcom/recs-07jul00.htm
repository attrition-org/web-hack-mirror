      </FONT></FONT></B></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1><B>The vote for the five At-Large Directors 
  should be conducted by region, as defined in the ICANN Bylaws. A candidate 
  will run in the region in which he/she is a citizen. An At-Large Member will 
  vote in the region in which he/she resides. Thus, the At Large election will 
  be 5 separate elections in 5 distinct districts, with one candidate emerging 
  as the winner in each district.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1><B>Commentary:</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT face=Arial>The original ICANN Bylaws defined five regions (Africa, 
    Asia/Pacific, Europe, Latin America/Caribbean, and North America), and 
    mandated that there must always be at least one citizen of each region on 
    the Board at any given time. The geographic diversity requirement was thus 
    stated in general terms, which proved unworkable when applied to the 
    realities of ICANN's distributed structure. (Nine of the ICANN Directors are 
    chosen by three Supporting Organizations, which choose their Directors 
    asynchronously, which raised the possibility that an SO would be restricted 
    to electing a citizen of a single region, if the departing Director was the 
    only citizen of that region on the Board.) For practical reasons, the 
    geographic diversity mandate was amended to require that the At Large 
    Directors (without reference to the 9 SO Directors) must include at least 
    one citizen of each geographic region. At ICANN's March meeting in Cairo, 
    the Board voted to hold a round of elections for 5 Directors by November, 
    retaining the minimum requirements of "one citizen of each 
    region."</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT face=Arial>It has been suggested that this year's election be 
    conducted globally, rather than by region, meaning that members from each 
    region would be able to cast votes for any candidate from any 
    region.</FONT></P><FONT face=Arial>
    <P><FONT face=Arial><B>Reasons for preferring Regional 
    Elections:</B></FONT></P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>- Regional elections prevent North Americans and/or 
      Europeans from choosing the winner in every region, due to their 
      overwhelming numbers (roughly 80% of the current At Large Membership 
      applicants are from North American and Europe)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>- Regional elections make overall capture less likely, 
      because any corporation or other special interest group would have to 
      organize large numbers of At Large Membership in each region </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>- Regional elections tend to focus each region's 
      attention on one race for one Director, reducing voter confusion and 
      increasing the stakes for each region.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT face=Arial><B>A Note on Citizenship vs. Residence:</B></FONT></P>
    <P><FONT face=Arial>Since its creation, ICANN&#8217;s bylaws have measured 
    geographic diversity in terms of citizenship (rather than actual residence) 
    for purposes of its Directors. However, ICANN looks to residence (of the At 
    Large Members) for purposes of voting. This is because it is easy to verify 
    residence (to some degree of confidence) through the use of postal mail. To 
    vote, an At Large Member must receive the PIN number that is sent through 
    postal mail. By contrast, it would be impossible for ICANN to attempt to 
    verify the legal citizenship of every At Large 
  Member.</FONT></P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Arial>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT face=Arial>The elements of the questionnaire (and hence the 
    ICANN-provided web page) are designed to facilitate candidate communication 
    of relevant information to At Large Members in a fair and equal way. The 
    biographical information, candidate statement, and hyperlink provide 
    candidates the ability to explain to voters why he/she would be the best 
    choice for a position on the ICANN board. The required disclosures are 
    intended to give voters the necessary information about connections the 
    candidate may have with entities who have an interest in the outcome of the 
    ICANN policy process while maintaining to the greatest extent feasible the 
    privacy of the candidates.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT face=Arial>The limited and structured nature of the web page 
    provided by ICANN serves numerous practical and substantive 
    purposes:</FONT></P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>- Reduces voter confusion and heightens ease of access 
      to relevant information</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>- Promotes fair and equal candidate communications

      <P><FONT face=Arial>- Makes feasible ICANN management of the web

      <P><FONT face=Arial>- Makes feasible translations of candidate pages into 
      major languages of the regions</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT face=Arial>Any hardship imposed by the word limits or structured 
    nature of the web page should be alleviated by each candidate's ability to 
    provide a hyperlink to a web site of his/her choice. However, ICANN should 
    promote fairness, equality, and focus on substantive issues by encouraging 
    candidates to use the hyperlink to link to relevant information and to 
    refrain from significant spending on the production of a web 
  page.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Arial>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT face=Arial>In the interest of holding a fair and effective 
    election, ICANN should attempt to minimize the relative advantages enjoyed 
    by candidates with money, whether personal, corporate, or organizational. By 
    facilitating communication on equal terms, ICANN can discourage overt 
    campaign expenditures, while focusing the membership on candidates' 
    qualifications and views as they relate to ICANN&#8217;s technical coordination 
    mission.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT face=Arial>Formal restrictions on speech and spending would be both 
    unwise and impossible to monitor and enforce. Thus, to ensure the fairness 
    of the election, ICANN should rely on the Internet to promote dialogue and

  <P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1><B>ICANN should use the Alternative (also 
  known as "Preferential" or "Single-Transferable") Voting System to conduct 
  this election.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1><B>In an Alternative Vote system voters rank 
  the candidates in order of preference. ("1" for their first choice, "2" for 
  their second, etc.) Voters may rank as many or as few candidates as they 
  choose. The votes are then tallied according to the first preferences (the 
  "1"s). If at that point one candidate has an absolute majority (50% + 1) of 
  the vote, he/she is elected. If not, the candidate with the fewest votes is 
  eliminated. The eliminated candidates votes are redistributed to the next 
  ranked candidates (the "2"s). The votes are counted again to determine whether 
  any candidate has a majority. If not, the elimination process is repeated 
  until one candidate gains a majority.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1><B>Commentary:</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT face=Arial>The advantage of this system is its intuitive fairness. 
    It allows votes for candidates with similar voter appeal to accumulate. It 
    allows voters to rank candidates in order of their true preferences while 
    still being assured that their vote will influence the election. It 
    encourages candidates to appeal broadly to voters.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT face=Arial>One other option on which the Election Committee also

<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <P><font face="Arial"><FONT size=+1><B>The Board should revise the current member-nomination 
    (also called &quot;self-nomination&quot;) requirement that candidates obtain 
    the support of 10% of activated members. In choosing another ballot access

  <BLOCKQUOTE>

        members. </B></FONT></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><FONT size=+1><B>Conversely, to protect against the 
        possibility that no candidate is able to meet the requirement, this option

        be nominated in any event.</B></FONT></font></p>
      <p><font face-"Arial"><FONT size=+1><B>In addition, this option could
        include a qualification that all those who obtain a certain number of

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT face=Arial>The Election Committee has chosen to use the term 
    "Member Nomination" in place of the term "Self-Nomination" used in the 
    proposed staff recommendations. The Election Committee believes that "Member 
    Nomination" better represents the intent of the extra-Nominating Commitee 
    nomination procedure. However, the substantive meaning of the term "Member 
    Nomination" is the same as the meaning of the term "Self-Nomination" as it 
    was used in the staff proposal for Self-Nomination procedures. 
  </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1><B>General Commentary:</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT face=Arial>Among the many options considered by the Election 
    Committee, the above options are the ones that garnered substantial 
    support from members of the Election Commitee. This commentary provides, in 
    a general sense, the issues raised by the different options. Election 
    Committee members offer their individual views below.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT face=Arial><B>Option 1.</B> The advantage of option 1 is that it is 
    the least restrictive for ballot access. All those with a significant amount 
    of support may get onto the ballot. The disadvantages of option 1 are (1) 
    that it is difficult to gauge the correct percentage-based threshhold to 
    allow access but to deter frivolous candidacy, and (2) that the number of 
    candidates on the ballot could be quite large, potentially causing voter 
    confusion and vote dilution.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT face=Arial><B>Option 2.</B> The advantages of option 2 are (1) that 
    it guarantees a manageable but still relatively large field of candidates, 
    and (2) that it prevents either the Nom Com candidates or the Member 
    Nominated candidates from having an appearance of special preference because 
    of the numbers allowed on the ballot. The disadvantages of option 2 are (1) 
    that it could encourage head-to-head competition between potential member 
    nominated candidates, and (2) that it could limit ballot access for some 
    potential member nominated candidates who have a significant percentage of 
    member endorsements.</FONT></P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT face="Arial"><B>Charles Costello:</B></FONT></P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT face="Arial">The formula I favor is to make 10 
        or 12 the maximum number of slots on the ballot, thus most likely
        giving members a chance to put somewhere between 5-9 candidates 
        on the ballot.  The top endorsement getters would get the 
        available ballot slots, keeping only the 20-endorsement 
        minimum.  Members would be allowed to endorse 3-5 candidates. 
        The tradeoff here is that voters get more choice 
        in the nominating process, balanced by having presumably a 
        smaller number of final candidates to choose from.  Entry 
        barriers to the ballot (up to the fixed ceiling) are minimized, 
        thus ensuring a "full" ballot without requiring what might 
        be difficult percentages to achieve.  The problem of "too many"
        candidates placing a burden (disincentive to vote) on members 
        to find out who's who is avoided.  As long as we allow a 
        reasonable number to "win" a slot on the ballot, I don't mind 
        the competitive element because it lets candidates energize 
        the voters a bit and demonstrate their voter attractiveness 
        at the outset of the campaign period.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT face="Arial"><B>Lorrie Faith Cranor:</B></FONT></P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>I support Option 1 with a 2% threshold. 
      In regions with less than 1,000 members a minimum threshold of 
      20 supporters should be required. In large regions of over 
      10,000 members the threshold should be fixed at 200 
      supporters.<BR>Option 2 basically turns the member 
      nomination period into a competitive primary in which each candidate will 
      have to actively campaign in order to ensure that he or she is among the 
      top candidates. In option 1, candidates will have to demonstrate a minimum 
      level of support, but they will know what that level is and will have 
      fewer incentives to actively campaign to exceed that level of support. 
      While Option 1 may lead to a large number of candidates on the ballot, I 
      do not consider this to be a problem.</FONT></P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT face="Arial">I prefer a system which allows any Member 
        to be on the ballot with a reasonable amount of support.
        With no previous experience to guide us it is difficult to 
        judge the possible number of potential candidates.  However 
        by setting a fixed limit on the number of candidates the 
        nomination process becomes a competitive process.
        Thus I favour Option 1 with a 2% threshold. And with a 
        minimum of 20 supporters in regions with under 1,000 members 
        and a maximum of 200 supporters for regions over 10,000.
        I also support the ability of Members to endorse more than 
        one candidate.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial">I favour reducing the percentage from 10% 
        to at least 5% with a minimum number of 20 At Large Member endorsements 
        and no upper limit. This should keep the total number of candidates 
        down, but as a safety net I would strongly advise the Board to limit 
        the number of Member nominated candidates to no more than two times 
        the number of Nominating Committee candidates.

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT face="Arial">In choosing between the two options the Board should
      consider which option will best provide a panel that is independent, 
      thorough, impartial, and not burdensome to ICANN financially or in terms of 
      ICANN staff time and resources.</FONT></P>  
    <P><FONT face="Arial">The Election Committee has considered several
      specific options for composition of the Election Monitoring and Oversight
      Panel:</FONT></P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT face="Arial">One possibility that is consistent with Option 1 is 
        to invite the participation
        of the non-ICANN Board members of the current Election Committee to
        sit on the Election Committee.  In the event that some or all of the
        non-ICANN Board members of the Election Committee are not able to serve
        on the Election Monitoring and Oversight Panel, similarly qualified and 
        independent individuals could be selected in their place.  Generally,
        Option 1 is likely to result in a panel that can be very independent and
        impartial.  It raises concerns with regard to ability to donate sufficient
        time and resources to both be thorough and avoid unduly burdening ICANN.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial">One possibility consistent with Option 2 is to 
        appoint a group of international election oversight institutions organized 
        by the Carter Center.  The Carter Center has volunteered to pay the costs 
        of monitoring itself.  A second possibility consistent with Option
        2 is to invite the International Foundation for Election Systems (IFES), 
        which has submitted a proposal to the Election Committee to oversee the
        election process, to perform the Election Monitoring and Oversight panel
        functions.  Generally, Option 2 is likely to result in a panel 
        that has significant experience and resources and will be very thorough. 
        On the other hand, selection of institutions rather than individuals limits 
        ICANN's ability to ensure impartiality.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT face="Arial"><B>Scope:</B></FONT></P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT face="Arial">The Election Committee recommends limiting the scope of 
      the Election Monitoring and Oversight Panel to gathering and making public 
      information and observations about the election process. This approach allows 
      the Panel great latitude to obtain and evaluate information about the election 
      systems, with the ability to make that information public. Considering the 
      possible complications of turning any formal authority over the election results 
      to any group formed and operating outside of the ICANN process, the Election 
      Monitoring and Oversight Panel should provide full information while the power 
      to act should be retained by ICANN.</FONT></P>
