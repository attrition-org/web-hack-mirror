        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT face=Arial>"There shall be an At-Large Election Committee 
          responsible for recommending to the Board for its approval procedures

          measures to prevent fraud, etc. The committee will also be responsible 
          for oversight and monitoring of those processes. The committee shall 
          operate to the extent practical in an open and transparent manner, 
          giving due regard to protecting the confidentiality of private 
          information of ICANN At-Large members, proprietary information of 
          election companies, and other matters (such as certain information
