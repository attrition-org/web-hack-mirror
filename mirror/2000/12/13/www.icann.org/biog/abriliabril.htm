in a number of pro-bono Net-related initiatives, such as BCNet,
a local community network; a pioneering project on electronic
democracy (http://bcnet.upc.es/democ.htm); and the domini .ct
campaign, a 7000+ adherents strong campaign seeking the recognition
of a TLD aimed for the Catalan-speaking cultural community. He
has been specially involved in all the DNS reform process that
eventually has brought ICANN into existence. He was elected to
the gTLD-MoU Policy Oversight Committee. He was a member of the
DNSO Names Council representing the Registrars Constituency until
his selection for the ICANN Board of Directors, and co-chaired
DNSO Working Group A on uniform dispute resolution policy.</FONT></P>
