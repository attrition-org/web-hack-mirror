law, including, more recently, domain name issues. Mr. Cohen is
actively involved in numerous national and international IP organizations,

CBA, and IBA, which collectively represent the interests of all
categories of intellectual property stakeholders, including small
and large businesses, and individuals. Mr. Cohen has taken an
active role in Internet governance reform and the ICANN formation
process from the start, beginning with his participation in the
WIPO-IAHC meetings in Geneva in 1997, through the formation of
the DNSO, and ultimately the Intellectual Property Constituency,
where he served as the IPC&#146;s first President and Names Council
representative until his election to this Board. Mr. Cohen has
also co-chaired Working Groups A and B, and worked on the Registrars&#146;
Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy.</FONT></P>
