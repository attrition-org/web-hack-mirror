      <H3><A NAME="Workshop"></A><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Workshop at
      ICANN Annual Meeting (13 November)</FONT></U></H3>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">For several months, a <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/idn-charter.html">working
      group of the Internet Engineering Task Force</A> (IETF) has been
      working to develop a standard specifying the requirements for
      internationalized access to domain names. This standard, when
      it is completed, will extend the operation of the Internet's
      Domain Name System (DNS) to character sets other than ASCII (the
      only character set currently supported) such as Arabic, Chinese,
      Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, the Scandanavian languages, and
      Spanish.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Several experimental testbeds are in operation
      or have been announced. These testbeds are testing a variety
      of approaches under consideration by the IETF working group,
      but are part of a common commitment to converge on whatever standard
      solution is ultimately adopted.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">These developments, which could bring very
      significant changes to the way the DNS can be used, have attracted
      remarkably little public notice. To help explain the status of
      these efforts and their potential effects (both positive and
      negative) and to increase public awareness, ICANN will sponsor
      a workshop on internationalized domain names on Monday, 13 November
      2000, in conjunction with its annual meeting in Marina del Rey,
      California. The meeting is planned to take place at 10:30 am
      in the Santa Monica Room of the Marina Beach Hotel. (For details
      on the ICANN annual meeting, please see &lt;<A HREF="../mdr2000/index.html">http://www.icann.org/mdr2000/</A>&gt;.)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The workshop will begin with a presentation
      on the status of the efforts of the IETF Internationalized Domain
      Names working group, followed by brief talks by several companies
      working toward implementation of internationalized domain names,
      including <A HREF="http://www.i-dns.net/">i-DNS.net</A>, <A 
      HREF="http://verisign-grs.com/multilingual/multilingual.html">Verisign
      Global Registry Services</A>, and the <A HREF="http://www.minc.org/">Multilingual
      Internet Names Consortium</A>. After these presentations, there
      will be an open discussion and questions will be taken from the
      press and public.</FONT></P>

      <H3><A NAME="BeginningofRegistrations"></A><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Beginning
      of Registrations in Verisign Testbed (10 November)</FONT></U></H3>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The workshop will be held just three days
      after one of the testbeds begins taking registrations of names
      in the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean character sets. Verisign
      Global Registry Services has announced that it will begin taking
      registrations beginning at 00:00 UTC on Friday, 10 November 2000,
      of names consisting of the multilingual (Unicode) characters
      listed at &lt;<A HREF="http://verisign-grs.com/multilingual/unicode.html">http://verisign-grs.com/multilingual/unicode.html</A>&gt;.
      (A graphic presentation of the listed characters can be found
      at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.unicode.org/charts/">http://www.unicode.org/charts/</A>&gt;.)
      Approximately twenty ICANN-accredited registrars are expected
      to participate, offering registrations in competition with one
      another. The testbed plan is to have the registered names become
      operational after several weeks in which only registrations will
      be taken.<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE SIZE="1"></FONT>
