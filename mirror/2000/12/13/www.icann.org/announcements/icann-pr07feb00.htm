  <H2><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial">Update on ICANN Cairo Meetings
  &amp; Call for Sponsors</FONT></CENTER></H2>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">On behalf of the local organizing committee,
  I would like to extend a warm welcome to all who plan to attend
  the 7-10 March ICANN meetings in Cairo, Egypt. Details on the
  meetings have been posted at &lt;<A HREF="../cairo2000/cairo-details.htm">http://www.icann.org/cairo2000/cairo-details.htm</A>&gt;,
  including information on hotel options, meeting schedules and
  agendas, and pre-registration.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Hosted by the Egyptian Ministry of Communication,
  the Cabinet Information and Decision Support Center (IDSC), and
  the Internet Society of Egypt, this will be the first ICANN meeting
  in the Middle East, and the first on the African continent. The
  local organizing committee is working hard to ensure a productive
  and enjoyable gathering for ICANN and its constituent organizations.
  In that regard, the committee is seeking sponsors for the Cairo
  meetings. Sponsorships are available at two levels:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Meeting Sponsors will be asked to contribute
    US $10,000. Meeting Sponsors will be prominently recognized at
    the meetings and in online and print materials, and will have
    the opportunity to distribute informational materials to meeting
    attendees in the hotel foyer. Most importantly, Meeting Sponsors
    will be highlighted at the gala dinner being planned for the
    evening of 8 March.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Meeting Co-Sponsors will be asked to contribute
    US $5,000. Meeting Co-Sponsors will be recognized at the ICANN
    meetings and in online and print materials, and will have the
    opportunity to distribute informational materials to meeting
    attendees in the hotel foyer. Each meeting Co-Sponsor will be
    highlighted at one reception, lunch, or event during the course
    of the meetings.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
