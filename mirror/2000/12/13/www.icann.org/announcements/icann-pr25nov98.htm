<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>ICANN Membership Advisory Committee—Expressions of
Interest Sought by 5 December, 1998</FONT></CENTER>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>The ICANN Bylaws call for a membership structure to be established
to elect At Large directors.&nbsp; (See <A
HREF="http://www.icann.org/bylaws-pr23nov98.html">Bylaws</A>
Article V, Section 9(c))

<P>The Initial Board is establishing an advisory committee (see <A
HREF="http://www.icann.org/bylaws-pr23nov98.html">Bylaws</A>
Article VII, Section 3(c)) to advise it on the appropriate membership
structure
to satisfy the need for world wide representation on the board, and in
particular how to create a diverse and open membership without
subjecting
the corporation to undue risk of capture by any particular interest
group.&nbsp;
The advisory committee will consist of up to ten members, and will
include
Initial Board members George Conrades as Chairman, and Greg Crew. The
Berkman
Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School has agreed to
provide
assistance to the committee, including an independent study of
membership
issues.

<P>Expressions of interest are invited from individuals willing to serve
on this committee, which will address specific issues including but not
limited to:

<P>a) membership structures and arrangements that will provide a world
wide representative body to nominate and elect the 9 At Large ICANN
board
directors (with the goal of recommending three to five options to the
ICANN
Board).

<P>b) appropriate rights and obligations of members, including
membership
application and registration requirements, membership fee structures,
liability
limitation of members, and voting rights and procedures.

<P>c) requirements and procedures for various forms of membership,
including
individual, corporate and association.

<P>d) efficient procedures for members to nominate and participate in
the
election of At Large directors, and to participate in general meetings
of the corporation.

<P>The work of the advisory committee will be open and inclusive of all
members of the Internet community.&nbsp; Draft and final recommendations
will be posted on the ICANN web site, and suggestions and comments via
the Internet will be invited from interested parties.&nbsp;
Recommendations
from the committee will be subject to the notice and comment procedures
set forth in the <A
HREF="http://www.icann.org/bylaws-pr23nov98.html">Bylaws</A>,
Article III, Section 3.

<P>The ICANN Board will select the committee with the goal of assembling
a diverse and broadly representative group.&nbsp; Expressions of
interest
to participate are to be directed to <A
HREF="mailto:msvh@icann.org">msvh@icann.org</A>,
by midnight, 5 December, 1998, US west coast time. Applicants are
requested
to state what contribution they would expect to make towards the work of
this committee; such statements need not be more than 100 words.

<P>The committee will commence work in December, 1998.&nbsp; Most of the
work of the committee will be conducted via phone or the Internet.&nbsp;
A final meeting is planned to be held in Singapore on 1 March, 1999, to
prepare a report to the ICANN board by the end of March. Committee
members
will be expected to devote sufficient time to the work of the committee
to achieve this very tight schedule.

<P>Pending the identification of an ICANN funding mechanism and the
actual
receipt of funds, ICANN's resources to support meeting and travel
expenses
of its committees is very limited.&nbsp; We ask that committee members
assist us by assuming personal responsibility for their travel expenses,
if possible.&nbsp; We will facilitate phone participation in
face-to-face
meetings as necessary.
