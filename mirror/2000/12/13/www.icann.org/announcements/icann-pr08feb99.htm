<CENTER><B>ICANN Releases Draft Accreditation Guidelines for Domain-Name
Registrars--</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>Proposal to be Available for Public Comment at www.icann.org</B></CENTER>


<P>Los Angeles-In a first step towards establishing fair and consistent
guidelines and procedures that will increase competition and global participation
in domain-name registration services, the non-profit Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) today is releasing for public comment
a draft proposal for the accreditation of Internet domain-name registrars.&nbsp;
The draft includes criteria for selecting the five registrars who will
test the system for a two-month period beginning at the end of April.

<P>The proposed accreditation guidelines, comprising nearly 30 pages of
detailed analysis and proposed standards, will be published on ICANN's
Web site (www.icann.org) today for public comment and suggestions.&nbsp;
The final version of the guidelines will provide requirements for accreditation
of domain-name registrars in the .com, .org and .net top-level domains
(TLDs).&nbsp; Following public comment submitted in response to today's
posting, and comment and discussion at an open meeting in Singapore on
March 3, 1999, ICANN's initial board will consider adoption of the proposed
guidelines or a revised version.

<P>"We are pleased to have the opportunity to work with the Internet community
to create a stable but competitive market for domain-name registration
services in these three important domains," commented Esther Dyson, interim
chairman of the ICANN board.&nbsp; "One of the major reasons for the creation
of ICANN was to foster fair and open ground rules in the domain-name system,
and we are now approaching a major milestone in achieving that goal.&nbsp;
We aim to design a system that promotes the stability of the Internet and
is capable of evolving in the future."

<P>The immediate development and adoption of accreditation guidelines is
necessary to implement an agreement by Network Solutions Inc. (NSI) to
develop a system that allows multiple registrars to register names in the
.com, .net, and .org TLDs in competition with NSI.&nbsp; Since 1993, NSI
has been the sole provider of direct domain-name registration services
in these TLDs as part of a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Government.&nbsp;
In the interests of opening the process to robust competition, a recent
amendment to the cooperative agreement paved the way for other companies
to register unique second-level domain names on behalf of their customers
in the NSI-maintained TLD database (the "registry").

<P>NSI initially will open the database to five registrars as part of a
test phase in which the shared registration system will be launched, evaluated
and improved.&nbsp; Rather than participating in the test as one of the
five registrars, NSI will continue its existing registrar operations during
the test phase.&nbsp; After completion of the test, NSI will be required
to provide equal access to registry services through the shared registration
system to all accredited registrars (including itself) at prices to be
agreed upon by the U.S. Government and NSI under the terms of the cooperative
agreement.&nbsp; The price charged by NSI for registry services will be
based on NSI's costs, plus a reasonable return on its investment.

<P>Key elements of the proposed guidelines on which ICANN is soliciting
comments include minimum technical, operational and financial criteria
for entering the registration business; requirements for portability of
domain names among registration companies; protections against fraud and
infringement of intellectual property rights; data security, privacy, and
protection; and special technical requirements to protect the stability
and operational integrity of the Internet.&nbsp; ICANN is seeking public
comment on these proposed criteria, as well as on a proposed fee structure
based on an initial accreditation fee and an ongoing charges on regisration
volume.

<P>Because testbed participants will be required to provide enhanced technical
and engineering support to interface with NSI during the testing phase,
the proposal specifies additional criteria for selection of the five testbed
registrars.&nbsp; The early accreditation of these registrars for the test
period is not intended or expected to give them any competitive advantage.&nbsp;
Indeed, they will be required to devote significant time, expertise, and
resources to ensure the success of the testing process, and they must be
prepared to publish operational information as part of the test evaluation.

<P>"Much of the material in these proposed guidelines reflects planning
and analysis done by others in recent years," said Michael Roberts, ICANN
interim CEO and head of the proposal drafting effort.&nbsp; "We've pulled
that thinking together, updated it to reflect the agreement between ICANN
and the government, and tailored it to the needs of NSI's agreement with
the U.S. Government for the introduction of competition in the .com, .org
and .net domains.&nbsp; ICANN thanks all those who contributed."

<P>As with any other change in Internet management, the introduction of
the guidelines will be controversial. "We recognize that implementing changes
in the domain-name system will be a contentious issue," said Interim Chairman
Dyson.&nbsp; "The point is to make the transition fair, and the results
fair.&nbsp; As long as everyone knows the rules and can play on the same
terms, we will have achieved that.&nbsp; As the initial board considers
comments on the guidelines, we will work hard with the Internet community
to develop guidelines that strike everyone as reasonable, sound, and transparent."

<P>Along with the draft guidelines, ICANN also is posting several other
policy drafts and documents on which it is seeking public comment-including
a draft conflict of interest policy, a draft reconsideration policy, and
applications received from entities seeking recognition as ICANN Supporting
Organizations.

<P>About ICANN:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a new, private, non-profit, international
corporation formed by the global Internet community to assume responsibility
for managing Internet technical coordinating functions including domain-name
system (DNS) management, IP address block allocation, the coordination
of the assignment of technical protocol parameters, and root server system
management, now performed by, or on behalf of, the U.S. Government.

<P>ICANN was created by the global Internet community in response to "Management
of Internet Names and Addresses," a U.S. Government statement of policy
issued in June 1998, that invited the global Internet community to form
a new, private sector organization to undertake management of Internet
domain-name system functions.&nbsp; In November 1998, ICANN entered into
an agreement with the U.S.&nbsp; Government to design and develop the methods
and procedures that should be in place to transition DNS management responsibility
to the private sector from the government.&nbsp; It is expected that this
transition will be completed by September 2000.

<P>ICANN's initial board is led by interim chairman Esther Dyson, and has
members from six nations.&nbsp; This initial board, with assistance from
staff and several committees, is working to pave the way for a smooth and
stable transition to private sector management of technical management
functions.&nbsp; The day-to-day management of ICANN is led by its interim
President and CEO, Mike Roberts.&nbsp; The initial board members will be
succeeded by board members elected by four different constituency groups,
collectively representing a broad range of the Internet's technical and
user communities around the globe.
