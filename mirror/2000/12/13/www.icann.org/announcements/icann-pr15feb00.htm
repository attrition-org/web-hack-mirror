  <H2><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN Public Forum for Ad Hoc
  Group on Numbering and Addressing</FONT></CENTER></H2>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In response to requests from a number of
  interested companies and individuals, ICANN has created an ad
  hoc group to study and report on requirements for future numbering
  policies. The objective of the ad hoc group is to identify issues
  and problems of relevance to future policy in the area of addressing
  and numbering.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The work of the ad hoc group will take
  place in a public comment forum, being launched today, and is
  open to any interested participant or observer. See &lt;<A HREF="../adhoc/index.htm">http://www.icann.org/adhoc/index.htm</A>&gt;
  to access the public comment forum.</FONT></P>

  </UL>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">At the August 1999 ICANN meeting in Santiago
  a <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-26aug99.htm#99.79">resolution</A>
  was adopted to establish an ad hoc group to be charged with developing
  the objectives and proposing structures for future policies in
  the area of numbering, especially as required to meet global
  market needs and taking into account the convergence of information
  technology services and networks. A draft charter for the ad
  hoc group was <A HREF="../minutes/minutes-04nov99.htm#Ad-HocGroup">endorsed</A>
  by the ICANN Board at its November 1999 meeting in Los Angeles,
  as follows:</FONT></P>

    <LI><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Charter for the Ad Hoc group.</FONT></B>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;The ad hoc group should identify
    the key technology, commercial and economic drivers that will
    affect addressing and numbering in the Internet. Recognising
    the risks of specifying modifications to core Internet technologies
    in a small group that inevitably understands some elements of
    the picture better than others, the group will identify issues,
    problems, risks, and opportunities, but is not expected to propose,
    much less adopt, technical solutions to them. The assessment
    must include current trends in services and network convergence
    and globalisation, particularly those emerging from the telecommunications
    sector, as well as changes in the demands on traditional IP address
    space. Examples of technology forces to be considered include
    IMT 2000, 3GPP, and Bluetooth. The group will examine and identify
    any characteristics of these applications that they believe are
    so unusual as to challenge the Internet's technical tradition
    of an application-independent basic architecture for addressing
    and routing structures.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;The ad hoc group shall focus on the
    future demands and impacts these new technologies will have on
    the administration of IP address space. Particular attention
    must be given towards global policy formation and the identification
    of any requirements to Internet addressing in the future. If
    the ad hoc group identifies areas in which they believe changes
    to addressing architectures or other technologies should be considered,
    they should clearly identify the problems that require resolution
    rather than suggesting technical solutions so that appropriate
    responses to those requirements can be considered in a broader
    more open and technically<BR>
    responsive forum.&quot;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Ad Hoc Group will work through a dedicated
  ICANN Public Comment Forum on the ICANN website. Representatives
  of the organizations specified within the Resolution passed at
  the ICANN meeting held in Santiago (August 1999) have been invited
  to post their observations to this Forum. In order to progress
  work within the challenging timescale set out in the ICANN Resolution
  the<BR>
  ICANN Board has invited a small Editorial Group to co-ordinate
  the Forum.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The group includes representatives of businesses,
  including telecom operators and Internet service providers and
  trade organizations, the ASO Council, the ICANN Board, and other
  legitimately interested parties. The group will present an interim
  report before the second ICANN public meeting in 2000. A final
  report from the ad hoc group will be presented to the ICANN Board
  prior to the Annual Meeting in 2000.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">All conclusions and recommendations will
  be posted on the ICANN web site for<BR>
  public comment.</FONT></P>
