        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN has seen reports that Regland, Inc. has filed 
          a lawsuit against ICANN in state court in Texas. The lawsuit complains 
          about ICANN's statements concerning Regland's business practices in 
          taking money for &quot;pre-registrations&quot; in proposed top-level 
          domains (TLDs) that do not exist, have not yet been approved by ICANN, 
          and may never be available on the Internet. Regland's claims are utterly 
          baseless and ICANN regards the lawsuit as frivolous.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN believes that it is entirely appropriate to 
          alert the public that no TLDs have been selected and that no company 
          &#151; including Regland &#151; is yet authorized to be selling domain 
          names in new TLDs. These statements are entirely true and are designed 
          to caution consumers who may be mislead into believing that they have 
          actually registered a name in a TLD that does not yet exist.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">On 29 September, ICANN's primary advisory body on 
          domain name issues &#151; the Names Council of ICANN's <a href="http://www.dnso.icann.org">Domain 
          Name Supporting Organization</a> &#151; issued a statement warning consumers 
          that &quot;it is premature for companies to offer pre-registration services 
          for domain names in speculative new TLDs. To date, no new TLDs have 
          been selected and there is no guarantee that any particular organization 
          will be authorized to take registrations for any particular TLD. The 
          registration of names in new TLDs will be done on a fair basis, and 
          the practice of pre-registration should not be encouraged.&quot;</FONT></P>
