        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">On Monday, 2 October 2000 the application
        period for those seeking to sponsor or operate new TLDs ended.
        A total of 47 applications were received during the application
        period. ICANN has posted a <A HREF="/tlds/tld-applications-lodged-02oct00.htm">list
        of the applicants and the TLD strings they are requesting</A>.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN's staff is currently doing an initial
        review of the applications. This includes:</FONT>
        <UL>
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Reviewing the applications to ensure they
          include all the required parts.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Reviewing <A HREF="/tlds/new-tld-application-instructions-15aug00.htm#VI">requests
          made by applicants for confidential treatment of the materials
          they have submitted</A>. This involves ensuring that applicants
          are not refusing to allow public disclosure of materials they
          submit, except in cases of legitimate trade-secret information.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Where an application seeks alternative

        portions of applications on the ICANN web site on approximately
        Wednesday, 11 October 2000. This is a delay from the previous
        goal of Saturday, 7 October 2000 because (a) we received more
        applications than assumed in establishing that goal and (b) many
        applicants have made broad claims of confidentiality that should
        be resolved before full posting.</FONT>
