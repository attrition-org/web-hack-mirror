<P><B>Meeting to be held in Cambridge, Massachusetts</B>
<BR><B>Saturday, November 14, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm</B>
<BR><B>Cambridge Marriott, Cambridge, MA</B>

<P>The Board of Directors of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers (ICANN) will hold a public meeting on Saturday, November 14,
at the Cambridge Marriott, Cambridge, Massachusetts, from 9:00 am until
4:00 pm.&nbsp; The meeting is open to all interested parties.&nbsp; The
board members will introduce themselves and they hope to hear comments
and concrete suggestions from the attendees on issues including:
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
Accountability and Representation—Possible Membership Structures</LI>

<UL>We have listened to comments and have decided to have members in order
to foster accountability and representation - and better decisions!&nbsp;
How should we do it? What are appropriate criteria for membership? Should
there be different kinds - and if so, what kinds? How should members elect
At-Large Board Members? How can we ensure broad geographical representation?</UL>
&nbsp;
<LI>
Technical Advice and Unbiased Expertise—Supporting Organization Structures</LI>

<UL>We need a structure to ensure that we get good technical advice and
unbiased expertise. Our chosen approach, Supporting Organizations, needs
clarification and definition.&nbsp; How can we design a structure so that
SOs are broadly representative of their communities? How can we avoid conflicts
of interest? What criteria should we use to approve SOs? What role should
they play vis a vis the Board?&nbsp; How should SO Board members be selected
and elected? What are the differences among the three SOs and how does
that affect the appropriate structure for each?</UL>
&nbsp;
<LI>
Conflicts of Interest and How to Avoid Them—Transparency, Rules, and Other
Mechanisms</LI>

<UL>We want this organization to be open, transparent, responsive, and
free of hidden conflicts of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can we ensure that?&nbsp;
What kinds of rules and disclosure are necessary? How quickly can we realistically
post minutes? We plan to hold open meetings along with most face-to-face
board meetings, in all parts of the world.&nbsp; How often should we do
that?
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
Time permitting, other issues may be discussed as well.

<P>The Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School
will be facilitating and moderating this meeting, which will be one in
a series of public meetings that the ICANN board will hold around the world
during the course of the next year.
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Registration</B>

<P>In order to prepare for its moderation and facilitation of the meeting,
the Berkman Center would like comments that help in framing the agenda
and fully understanding the issues. The ICANN board would also like information
about how many people expect to attend the meeting, and about how many
who cannot attend would access online video or audio coverage, which ICANN
is trying to arrange. You may submit comments without registering and you
may register without submitting comments.&nbsp; <A HREF="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/icann/sign-up.html">Registration/Comment
