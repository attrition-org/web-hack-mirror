<P>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which now
coordinates the Internet's address system, domain names and protocols,
has submitted its proposal for future management of Internet names and
addresses to the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

<P>In recently submitted written congressional testimony, Jon Postel,
Ph.D., a research scientist at the University of Southern California's
Information Sciences Institute (ISI) who has directed IANA since its
inception, said "this proposal is the result of an extensive process
of discussions and negotiations among a large number of interested
people and organizations conferences and, most appropriately for this
purpose, extensive use of the Internet with people all over the
world."

<P>IANA has been operating under a U.S. government contract.  Last
June, the NTIA issued a white paper calling on private-sector Internet
stakeholders to form a not-for-profit corporation to administer policy
for the Internet name and address system.

<P>The new IANA proposal, written in response to this white paper,
includes proposed articles of incorporation for a new, nonprofit
public-benefit corporation to be called the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), bylaws for the new organization,
and a list of nominations for an interim board to govern it until a
permanent board is elected.  The new organization, formally
incorporated in California, will not elect a board or adopt bylaws
until the NTIA has completed reviewing the IANA proposal.

<P>Dr. Postel said IANA will continue to function under its current
government contract until the new organization is formed to take over
its duties.  Comments on IANA's proposal should be directed by email
to comments@iana.org and will be posted electronically on the IANA
website at <A HREF="http://www.iana.org">http://www.iana.org</A>.  The
transmittal letter to NTIA, the proposed articles of incorporation,
bylaws and brief bios of the nominated board candidates are also
posted on the IANA website.

<P>Because he is recovering from surgery, Postel is currently
unavailable for comment on specifics of the IANA proposal and
transition.  While Postel is recuperating, all functions of IANA will
continue to be carried out reliably by ISI, and in accordance with
the directions of the appropriate authority.
