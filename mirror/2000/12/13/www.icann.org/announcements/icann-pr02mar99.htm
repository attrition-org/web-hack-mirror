<P><font face="Arial"><b><i>For Immediate Release </i></b> </font>
<P><font face="Arial">(Singapore, March 2, 1999) -- A powerful group of governments 
  today endorsed the establishment of the private-sector model for the technical 
  administration of the Internet. In a critical milestone for the establishment 
  of the new market-led technical management structure, nearly 20 national governments 
  from around the world reinforced the need for market-led solutions to the fast-moving 
  evolution of the Internet. Their actions confirmed the principles first put 
  in motion by the United States government in July 1998. </font>
<P><font face="Arial">Until late 1998, the Internet's technical administration 
  was performed by or on behalf of the United States government. </font>
<P><font face="Arial">The Governmental Advisory Committee of the Internet Corporation 
  for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) concluded its inaugural meeting today 
  by endorsing the principles behind the creation of ICANN and committing themselves 
  to play a constructive role in support of its processes. </font>
<P><font face="Arial">The national governments were joined by representatives 
  of key multilateral governmental organizations and treaty organizations, including 
  the European Commission, the International Telecommunications Union, the Organization 
  for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the World Intellectual Property 
  Organization. </font>
<P><font face="Arial">"Today represented a significant milestone in the establishment 
  of ICANN," said Australia's Dr. Paul Twomey, the Chairman of the Governmental 
  Advisory Committee. "We saw a broad cross-section of the community of nations 
  express strong support for the idea that the Internet is best managed by the 
  Internet community itself." </font>
<P><font face="Arial">The meeting was attended by representatives of 17 nations, 
  including Argentina, Australia, Bhutan, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Japan, 
  Korea, Mexico, Peru, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, Tuvalu, United States. Germany's 
  representative also attended today's meeting on behalf of the President of the 
  European Union. </font>
<P><font face="Arial">Dr. Twomey stated, "The governments and organisations attending 
  today's meeting represent the vast majority of Internet users. They also reflected 
  some of the most innovative policy approaches to the use of the Internet." </font>
<P><font face="Arial">For example, Tuvalu has recently made Internet history by 
  entering a lucrative commercial arrangement for the marketing of its .tv country 
  code top level domain (ccTLD). </font>
<P><font face="Arial">The discussions in Singapore covered a broad range of issues, 
  including matters of structure and organisation, as well as significant policy 
  issues such as the administration of ccTLDs. </font>
<P><font face="Arial">The Governmental Advisory Committee is not a decision-making 
  intergovernmental organization, but a forum for providing advice to ICANN. Under 
  ICANN's Bylaws, the ICANN Board may refer matters to the Governmental Advisory 
  Committee, or the Governmental Advisory Committee may raise issues and make 
  recommendations on its own initiative. </font>
<P><font face="Arial">A website for the Governmental Advisory Committee has been 
  established, which can be accessed through the ICANN Homepage <a href="../index.html">(http://www.icann.org)</a>. 
  </font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><font face="Arial"><b><i>About ICANN </i></b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial">The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers 
  (ICANN) is a new, non-profit, international corporation formed to oversee a 
  select number of the Internet's core technical management functions. Between 
  now and September 2000, ICANN is slated to gradually take over responsibility 
  for coordinating domain name system management, IP address space allocation, 
  protocol parameter assignment coordination, and root server system management. 
  </font> 
<P><font face="Arial">In the past, many of these functions have been handled by 
  the U.S. government, or by its contractors and volunteers. This informal structure 
  represented the spirit and culture of the research community in which the Internet 
  developed. However, the growing size and international importance of the Internet 
  has necessitated the creation of a technical management body that is both more 
  formalized in structure, and more fully reflective of the geographic diversity 
  of the Internet community. </font>
<P><font face="Arial">ICANN is a non-profit corporation with an international 
  board of directors. Its initial board is led by interim chairman Esther Dyson, 
  and has members drawn from several nations. This initial board is finalizing 
  ICANN's by-laws and procedures and working to pave the way for a smooth and 
  stable transition from the present administrative system. The initial board 
  members will be replaced by board members elected by four different constituency 
  groups, collectively representing a broad range of the Internet's technical 
  and user communities around the globe. </font>
