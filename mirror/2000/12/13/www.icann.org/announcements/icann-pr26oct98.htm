<P>NEW YORK, Oct. 26, 1998 -- The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers ("ICANN") today announced that it had elected its Initial Board
and chosen Michael M. Roberts as its Interim President and Chief Executive
Officer at a meeting yesterday.

<P>In addition, the Board chose Esther Dyson as its Interim Chairman, and
appointed an Executive Committee consisting of Dyson, Gregory L, Crew of
Australia, Hans Kraaijenbrink of The Netherlands and Roberts. The other
Initial Board members include Geraldine Capdeboscq (France), George H.
Conrades (United States), Gregory L. Crew (Australia), Frank Fitzsimmons
(United States), Hans Kraaijenbrink (The Netherlands), Jun Murai (Japan),
Eugenio Triana (Spain), and Linda S. Wilson (United States). [Editors note:
bios appear at the end of this release.]

<P>ICANN is a private, non-profit corporation, managed by an international
board, formed to coordinate and administer policies and technical protocols
relating to the domain name and address system that permits Internet communications
to be routed to the correct person or entity. Its proposed duties include
those now performed under U.S. Government contract by the Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority, whose Director, Internet pioneer Jon Postel, died earlier
this month.

<P>ICANN was originally proposed by Postel on behalf of a broad coalition
of Internet stakeholders in response to the request by the United States
last June that the Internet community create a global consensus non-profit
corporation to which the United States could transition the responsibility
for overseeing and funding those coordination activities. On October 16,
Dr. Postel unexpectedly passed away. With the loss of Dr. Postel, who had
served a central coordinating role in the creation of ICANN and in the
submission of the IANA proposal, many of the supporters of the IANA proposal
urged that the nascent ICANN organization be quickly constituted and elect
its Initial Board members so that ICANN, through its Initial Board, could
take on the management of the remainder of the transition process.

<P>At its first meeting, which took place in New York, the Board also adopted
basic organizational resolutions. The Board did not adopt bylaws, deferring
that until it had finished its consideration of the issues raised in the
Commerce letter and by various groups and individuals.

<P>With respect to the election of Roberts as Interim President, Board
members had been asked to suggest candidates for the position in advance
of the meeting, and several possible candidates were discussed. Following
this discussion, Dyson said, Roberts was appointed because his background,
experience and availability were a good fit with ICANN's needs at the moment.
Roberts has extensive experience with both networking and with non-profit
institutions, including service as the Vice President for Networking of
EDUCOM, an association of more than 600 member colleges and universities.
In 1991, he was detailed from EDUCOM to serve as a Founding Trustee and
the first Executive Director of the Internet Society, where he carried
out for this international organization many of the same start-up organizational
functions that will be required for ICANN. In 1996-97, he was an organizer
and first project director of the Internet2 project, a university effort
to design, integrate and deploy advanced networking infrastructure and
applications to support research, teaching and learning. His work in that
role included structuring and incorporating the University Corporation
for Advanced Internet Development (UCAID), another effort that will be
particularly helpful in the early organizational efforts for ICANN.

<P>Said Dyson: "Mike's long background in the networking field, and particularly
his experience in starting up significant non-profit organizations in this
field, are particularly applicable to what ICANN will need as it completes
its initial organizational efforts. His reputation and credibility will
be important assets for ICANN. He knows most of the relevant people and
organizations worldwide, but he is known for being nonpartisan."

<P>Roberts will begin work immediately. "It is critical," said Roberts,
"that the functions that ICANN will be responsible for be carried out without
interruption, and that the transition from United States control of some
of these functions and related assets be accomplished efficiently and quickly.
The tasks that require immediate attention include:
<UL>-- ICANN's short and long term funding mechanisms must be established;

<P>-- The Initial Board activities must be staffed and supported; given
the international character of that Board, the logistics of this effort
will be complex; and,

<P>-- The Initial Board needs to quickly make itself available to the entire
Internet community, both electronically and in person, so it can be certain
to hear and understand the concerns and needs of the community that it
is to serve."</UL>
Like the Initial Board members, who will serve only until the complete
permanent ICANN structure and full Board are in place (planned for the
fall of 1999), Roberts is not a candidate to be the long-term President
and Chief Executive Officer of ICANN. The Board will immediately begin
the process of searching for a long-term President and Chief Executive
Officer.

<P>Interim Chairman Dyson said that the Board is working on a response
to the Commerce letter relating to ICANN policies and bylaws, and that
it plans to deliver it in an open letter within two weeks. "in addition,"
she said, " we hope to begin to discuss the specific terms of a transition
agreement with the Commerce Department very soon. We hope ICANN can get
these preliminary issues resolved quickly, and turn to the long list of
important tasks that face us, including the establishment of a final membership
structure, the procedures for the election of Board members by that membership,
and the recognition and certification of the specialized Supporting Organizations
for Addresses, Protocols, and Domain Names that will be the working policy
bodies of ICANN."
