      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(10 November 2000) On the morning of 9
      November 2000, Economic Solutions, Inc. (&quot;ESI&quot;) filed
      a lawsuit against ICANN in United States District Court in St.
      Louis, Missouri. In the complaint it filed with the court, ESI
      seeks, among other things, to prohibit ICANN from establishing
      a &quot;.biz&quot; or &quot;.ebiz&quot; top-level domain (TLD)
      or any other TLD that is similar to the country code for Belize,
      &quot;.bz.&quot; ESI <A HREF="/tlds/correspondence/bz-letter-18oct00.htm">claims
      to have entered into a marketing agreement</A> with the Country
      of Belize to market the &quot;.bz&quot; country code TLD (ccTLD),
      and it claims that establishment of a .biz or .ebiz TLD would
      injure ESI, which allegedly has intellectual property rights
      in &quot;.bz.&quot; In its lawsuit, ESI also seeks to cause the
      transfer of the administration of the &quot;.bz&quot; TLD from
      the <A HREF="http://www.iana.org/root-whois/bz.htm">current administrators</A>
      to ESI.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Later that same day, ICANN opposed, on
      multiple grounds, ESI's motion for temporary restraining order.
      Following the hearing, the Court asked the parties to file additional
      briefs and supporting papers on November 13, 2000.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN believes that ESI's lawsuit is without
      merit. Procedurally, ICANN objects to being required to litigate
      the matter in Missouri. ICANN also denies that ESI has intellectual
      property rights in the &quot;.bz&quot; ccTLD. That ccTLD has
      been established for the operation in the benefit of the Internet
      community in Belize under the trusteeship of managers <A HREF="http://www.iana.org/cctld/icp1.htm">designated
      by the IANA</A> (ESI is not the designated manager or the designated
      sponsoring organization). It is important to note that ccTLD
      matters are governed by the longstanding principle, noted by
      Jon Postel in <A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1591.txt">RFC
      1591</A>, that &quot;Concerns about 'rights' and 'ownership'
      of domains are inappropriate. It is appropriate to be concerned
      about 'responsibilities' and 'service' to the community.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN believes that community-based discussion,
      through the ICANN process, about what TLDs should be established
      should be allowed to proceed without interference. Legal precedents
      <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/tlds/correspondence/bz-response-23oct00.htm">refute
      the claim</A> that TLDs enjoy trademark protection. The United
      States Patent and Trademark Office has <A HREF="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/tac/notices/guide299.htm">made
      clear</A> that a top-level domain name, when used as a registry
      under which lower-level domain names are registered, does not
      function as a source identifier subject to service-mark rights.
      This conclusion has been <A HREF="/tlds/correspondence/iod-v-core-22jun00.htm#IVB">followed
      in court</A>, and is consistent with the <A HREF="/gac/communique-24aug99.htm">advice
      of ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee</A>. Accordingly,
      ICANN intends to defend vigorously the Internet community's consensus-based
      process, with the hope that it leads to establishment of TLDs
      according to the community's wishes.</FONT></P>
