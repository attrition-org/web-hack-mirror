        <P><B><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial">ICANN Launches CEO Search,
        Retains Christopher Mill to Assist</FONT></B></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(May 3, 2000) The Internet Corporation
        for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) announced today the launch
        of a global search to recruit its next President and CEO. To
        guide the search process, the corporation has<BR>
        retained Christopher Mill of Christopher Mill &amp; Partners,
        a highly experienced executive search consultant based in London.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Finding the right person to lead ICANN
        in the next stage of its mission is critical. The Board is looking
        for candidates of demonstrated leadership, managerial competence,
        technical credibility, and international experience<BR>
        who will work to serve the entire Internet community, from individual
        and business to academic and public interests. The job requires
        patience, persistence, an open style, and the ability to generate
        an active-minded consensus around difficult issues that are nonetheless
        essential for the effective and efficient operation and growth
        of the Internet.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN actively welcomes expressions of
        interest and recommendations of possible candidates. Communications
        and queries should be sent to Christopher Mill at &lt;<A HREF="mailto:%20%20exec-search@icann.org">exec-search@icann.org</A>&gt;.
        Details about the position and the search process have been posted
        at &lt;<A HREF="../committees/exec-search/index.html">http://www.icann.org/exec-search/</A>&gt;.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN's current President and CEO, Mike
        Roberts, accepted the position in October 1998 with the understanding
        that he would lead ICANN through its start-up phase, including
        the establishment of a stable corporate structure<BR>
        and the transition to a fully constituted Board of Directors.
        As that process nears completion, ICANN's Board of Directors
        intends to appoint the next President and CEO before the end
        of 2000.</FONT></P>
        <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">About ICANN</FONT></B></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
        and Numbers (ICANN) is a technical coordination body for the
        Internet. Created in October 1998 by a broad coalition of the
        Internet's business, technical, academic, and user communities,
        ICANN is assuming responsibility for a set of technical functions
        previously performed under U.S. government contract by IANA and
        other groups.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Specifically, ICANN coordinates the assignment
        of the following identifiers that must be globally unique for
        the Internet to function:</FONT></P>
        <UL>
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Internet domain names</FONT>
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">IP address numbers</FONT>
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">protocol parameter and port numbers</FONT>
        </UL>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In addition, ICANN coordinates the stable
        operation of the Internet's root server system.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As a non-profit, private-sector corporation,
        ICANN is dedicated to preserving the operational stability of
        the Internet; to promoting competition; to achieving broad representation
        of global Internet communities; and to developing policy through
        private-sector, bottom-up, consensus-based means. ICANN welcomes
        the participation of any interested Internet user, business,
        or organization. See <A HREF="../index.html">http://www.icann.org</A>.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
