<h3 align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>ICANN BOARD APPOINTS LOUIS TOUTON <br>
  VICE PRESIDENT, GENERAL COUNSEL & SECRETARY </b></font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">Marina del Rey, CA (October 19, 1999) - The Internet Corporation 
  for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) announced today that its Interim Board 
  had appointed Louis Touton as the organization's Vice President, General Counsel 
  and Secretary. ICANN is the non-profit, global, consensus based organization 
  charged with overseeing the technical administration of the Internet. Touton 
  will be the first Vice President and General Counsel for the year old organization. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In his new capacity, Touton will be responsible for all 
  legal affairs of the corporation and report to the CEO and Board of Directors. 
  Touton joins ICANN from the law firm of Jones Day Reavis & Pogue where he has 
  been a partner since 1989. Touton joined the firm in 1981 and has primarily 
  handled intellectual property work for technology clients. Touton will assume 
  his new responsibilities on November 1 and will participate in ICANN's first 
  annual meeting November 1-4 in Los Angeles, CA. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">"I feel very fortunate in having someone of Louis' demonstrated 
  talents, experience, energy and enthusiasm on the ICANN staff," said ICANN Interim 
  President and CEO Mike Roberts. While at Jones Day, in the capacity as one of 
  ICANN's outside counsel, Touton has already made substantial contributions to 
  the development of ICANN policies in the areas of registrar accreditation and 
  domain name dispute resolution. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">"The Members of the ICANN Board and I are extremely pleased 
  that Louis is joining ICANN," said Interim Chairman of the ICANN Board Esther 
  Dyson. "His professional credentials are impeccable, but in addition he is a 
  pleasure to work with and has already invested a great deal of professional 
  and personal time in understanding the challenges and work ahead for ICANN." 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Touton has his J.D. from Columbia University School of Law 
  and B.S. degrees in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering from MIT. Following 
  his appointment, in a letter to Interim ICANN President Mike Roberts, Touton 
  announced his intention to waive his salary for his first year of service. In 
  his letter, Touton says, "I firmly believe that the ICANN cause is a good one 
  and deserves the volunteer spirit it has so broadly evoked."</font></p>
