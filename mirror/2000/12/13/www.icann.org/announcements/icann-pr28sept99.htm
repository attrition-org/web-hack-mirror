<P><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN, U.S. Department of Commerce,
and Network Solutions, Inc., Announce <BR>
Tentative Agreements on Future of Domain Name System</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">(Marina del Rey, CA) -- The Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) announced today
that it had tentatively reached a set of agreements with the U.S.
Department of Commerce and Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI), to resolve
outstanding differences among the three parties.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The agreements have been posted
for a thirty-day public comment period on the ICANN website at
<A HREF="http://www.icann.org/nsi/tentative-agreements.htm">http://www.icann.org/agreements.htm</A>
and will come before the Board for final consideration at its
November meeting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;The ICANN Board is pleased
that the lengthy negotiations over these issues have produced
a workable structure based on compromises by all sides,&quot;
said Esther Dyson, Interim Chairman of the ICANN Initial Board.
&quot;Our next step is to consider the input of the engineers,
businesses, academics, individual users and other interested parties
that make up the worldwide Internet. We look forward to welcoming
Network Solutions as an ICANN accredited registrar and to working
with them and the community to develop consensus policies regarding
the management of the Domain Name System.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The agreements consist of: (1)
a Registry Agreement between ICANN and NSI; (2) a revised Registrar
Accreditation Agreement between ICANN and all registrars in .com,
.net, and .org; (3) a revised post-testbed Registrar-License and
Agreement between NSI as registry and registrars; (4) an amendment
to the Cooperative Agreement between the Department of Commerce
and NSI; and (5) an amendment to the Memorandum of Understanding
between the Department of Commerce and NSI.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Among the key provisions set forth
in the agreements:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">NSI will recognize ICANN and
  agree to operate the .com, .org and .net registries in accordance
  with the Registry Agreement between ICANN and NSI and future
  consensus policies adopted by ICANN.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">NSI agrees to become an ICANN
  accredited registrar for the .com, .org, and .net domains. The
  ICANN accreditation agreement has been revised to include improvements
  suggested by registrars during the testbed phase.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">NSI has agreed to participate
  in the funding of ICANN through registry and registrar fees,
  provided that they are equitably apportioned.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">All accredited registrars (including
  NSI) will be required to provide continued public access to &quot;WHOIS&quot;
  data.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The InterNIC website will be
  maintained as a public information site with a directory of links
  to accredited registrars.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Today&#146;s agreements
signal the end of the months of uncertainty which have limited
ICANN&#146;s ability to address its responsibilities,&quot; said
Mike Roberts, ICANN&#146;s Interim President &amp; CEO. &quot;Subject
to the comments of the global Internet community, the staff and
I look forward to working with the Board and the community to
implement these agreements.&quot;</FONT></P>
