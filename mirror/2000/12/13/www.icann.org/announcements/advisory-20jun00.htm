      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Overview</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">On June 8, 2000, the Internet Corporation
      for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was named in a lawsuit
      by Afternic.com, Inc., a New York company that operates a domain-name
      auction site. In the lawsuit, which is pending in White Plains,
      New York, Afternic claims that ICANN treated Afternic unfairly
      in handling its application for accreditation by ICANN as a domain-name
      registrar. ICANN believes that it has handled Afternic's application
      in an appropriate manner, according to ICANN policies and legal
      requirements, and consistently with the manner in which other
      applications have been handled.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">History of Afternic Application</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In August 1999, ICANN adopted a dispute-resolution
      policy to address the practice of registering another company's
      or person's name with the intent to demand a ransom from the
      company or person (cybersquatting). In November 1999, the U.S.
      Congress passed the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act
      outlawing such abusive practices.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In investigating Afternic's application
      for accreditation, ICANN discovered that Afternic's web site
      presented many offers to sell domain names based on other company's
      names, some with remarks reflecting the abusive nature of the
      offers. One company name, for example, was offered with the remark
      that it would be an &quot;Excellent domain for a reseller, owner,
      or competitor of&quot; the company (this example was offered
      at a starting bid of $125,000). Although ICANN alerted Afternic
      to the situation, Afternic denied any responsibility for these
      offers on its web site. Several months later, Afternic's site
      is still offering the example name mentioned above, though the
      starting bid has now been reduced to $50. Currently, Afternic's
      site is offering many other domains incorporating well-known
      business, celebrity, and government agency names, such as:</FONT></P>

        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">mircosotf.com (with the remark &quot;this
        is a common miss spelt version of one of the most active sites
        on the web&quot;).</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">TheOlympics2000.com (Section 220506 of
        title 36 of the United States Code prohibits use of the word
        &quot;Olympic&quot; to falsely suggest authorization by the International
        or United States Olympic Committees; Section 3002(a) of the Anticybersquatting
        Consumer Protection Act prohibits bad-faith registration of domain
        names covered by Section 220506).</FONT>

      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Background on Accreditation Process</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Since April of 1999, ICANN has accredited
      over 100 registrars as a way of introducing competition to the
      domain-name registration business. Under an agreement ICANN has
      entered with Network Solutions (which operates the central database
      for domain names ending with .com, .net, and .org), registrars
      accredited by ICANN have the ability to put names directly into
      the database. In accord with this privileged position, accredited
      registrars agree to abide by policies developed through the ICANN
      process in consultation with the Internet community. As a part
      of the application process, prospective registrars submit an
      application to ICANN, which investigates the applicant as part
      of its responsibility for management of the domain name system.
      It was during this review that ICANN became concerned about the
      level of cybersquatting activity taking place on the Afternic
      site.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN communicated the concerns to Afternic
      and offered to work with them to find an acceptable solution.
      After some discussions, Afternic's owners submitted a substitute
      application in the name of a different company that would be
      operated separately, but later decided that such an approach
      was unacceptable to them and filed the lawsuit.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Status</FONT></U></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
      On Friday, June 9, the New York federal court denied Afternic's
      request that ICANN be ordered immediately to accredit Afternic.
      The court set a trial date for late July but also allowed ICANN
      to make a formal request to dismiss the case or transfer the
      case to Los Angeles, where ICANN is located and where Afternic
      submitted its application. The Court has scheduled a hearing
      on that request for Thursday, June 22, 2000.</FONT></P>
