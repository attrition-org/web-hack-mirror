  <P align=left>(August 11, 1999) The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names 
    and Numbers (ICANN) announced today that seven additional applicant companies 
    have met its registrar accreditation criteria. </P>
  <P align=left>As accredited registrars, these seven companies will compete in 
    the market for domain name registration services in the .com, .net, and .org 
    domains. In addition, they will be able to participate the ongoing testbed 
    program for the <a href="http://www.nsiregistry.com/documents/SRS_Overview_02.pdf">Shared 
    Registry System</a>, which allows multiple ICANN-accredited registrars to 
    provide domain name registration services in the .com, Net, and .org domains. 
    Under an <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/press/dns08061999.htm">agreement 
    announced August 6</a> by the U.S. Department of Commerce and Network Solutions, 
    Inc. (the developer of the Shared Registry System), new registrars that have 
    signed an accreditation agreement with ICANN will be eligible to join the 
    initial five testbed registrars as participants in the testbed operation. 
    The testbed phase is currently scheduled to conclude on September 10, 1999. 
  </P>
  <P align=left>The seven companies named today join the 57 companies that have 
    already been accredited by ICANN starting in April, 1999. Until the initial 
    introduction of competition in June, registration services in the .com, Net, 
    and .org domains were provided solely by Network Solutions, Inc., under a 
    1992 Cooperative Agreement with the US Government. </P>

  <P align=left>ABOUT REGISTRAR ACCREDITATION </P>
  <P align=left>Under an October 6, 1998 amendment to the Cooperative Agreement 
    between Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) and the US Government, the process of 
    opening the Internet Domain Name System's three largest domains to competition 
    was launched with a testbed phase that began on April 26. Five companies were 
    initially accredited to use the NSI Shared Registry System in a test operation 
    designed to ensure that the introduction of competition occurs in a smooth, 
    coordinated manner. The original testbed participants, all of which are now 
    offering registration services in competition with NSI, are: America Online; 
    CORE (Internet Council of Registrars); France Telecom/Oléane; Melbourne IT; 
    and register.com. For more on the testbed registrars, see <a href="http://www.icann.org/registrars/icann-pr21apr99.htm">http://www.icann.org/registrars/icann-pr21apr99.htm</a>.</P>
  <P align=left>By qualifying to be accredited as registrars in the .com, Net, 
    and .org top-level domains, the seven registrars named today join the five 
    original testbed registrars, as well as the 52 other companies that have already 
    qualified for ICANN accreditation. Under an agreement announced on August 
    6, 1999, the Shared Registry System testbed program has been expanded to extend 
    to all accredited registrars that sign the standard testbed registrar agreements 
    with NSI and meet technical certification requirements. For further details, 
    see <a href="http://www.icann.org/registrars/accreditation.html">http://www.icann.org/registrars/accreditation.html</a>.</P>
