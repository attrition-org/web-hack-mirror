          AT-LARGE MEMBERSHIP REGISTRATION <br>
          EXCEEDS 158,000 INTERNET USERS WORLDWIDE</font></b> </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">July 31, 2000 - Marina del Rey, CA 
          -- <a href="../index.html">The Internet Corporation for Assigned 
          Names and Numbers (ICANN)</a> announced today that it had ended its 
          first At-Large Membership registration period with more than 158,000 
          Internet users signed up worldwide. The registration period extended 
          from February 25 - July 31. The ICANN At-Large members will select five 
          members to the Board of Directors in October. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">ICANN's At-Large Membership program 
          is intended as a means for Internet users from all over the globe to 
          have a voice in ICANN's technical policymaking structure for the Internet's 
          domain name and numbering systems. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">During <a href="../at-large/at-large.htm">planning</a> 
          in 1999 and 2000 for the At-Large elections, many members of the Internet 
          community expressed concern that few people would be interested enough 
          in ICANN's technical coordination functions and domain name policy issues 
          to apply to become At-Large members. The projection adopted by the Board 
          in November 1999, called for at least 5,000 members before the election 
          process could continue. Since the At-Large member signup system began 
          operations in late February 2000, the registration numbers have far 
          surpassed all expectations, reaching more than thirty times the original 
          estimate.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"> Unfortunately, this success has not 
          come without its costs. The overwhelming number of registrations produced 
          significant logistical and financial problems for a system that was 
          established and intended to deal with fewer than 10,000 registrations. 
          Despite several system upgrades and a variety of other changes, the 
          registration system could not keep up with the demand, and many who 
          tried to register were not able to do so near the end of the registration 
          period. This is regrettable; ICANN believes that At-Large membership 
          should be open to all who are interested in joining. Unfortunately, 
          any postponement of the registration deadline would have made it impossible 
          to complete the elections this year, and the Board concluded that the 
          continued implementation of the ICANN structure -- including the addition 
          of At-Large representatives to ICANN's Board of Directors -- should 
          move forward on schedule. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">"This is only the beginning," said 
          ICANN Chairman Esther Dyson. We're delighted at the level of participation, 
          though somewhat dismayed at the competitive atmosphere that sometimes 
          emerged and the over-hyped expectations of ICANN's role. Now the task 
          is to move on to the next stage of the elections: finding good candidates 
          both from ICANN's Nominating Committee and among individuals nominated 
          by the At-Large members. We hope these candidates will engage in lively 
          and constructive debate about ICANN's activities and specific policies 
          as it carries out its mission of supporting the Internet's growth as 
          an open, robust and reliable medium for communications and commerce." 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">ICANN's <a href="http://www.icann.org/nomcom">Nominating 
          Committee</a> is scheduled to announce its set of nominees for this 
          year's election tomorrow, August 1. At-Large members who have activated 
          their membership will be eligible to cast a vote for one At-Large member 
          of the ICANN Board of Directors - one for each of five geographic regions 
          - in an all-electronic election that will be held for ten days commencing 
          October 1, 2000. Following registration, At-Large applicants will receive 
          a postal letter containing a personal identification number (PIN), and 
          must visit the At-Large website to activate their membership and become 
          eligible to vote. To date, approximately 40% of those who have received 
          their PIN letters have actually activated their membership. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Preliminary total registration numbers 
          by region are:</font> </p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Following the October election, ICANN 
          will conduct a thorough study of the ICANN At-Large membership program. 
          The study, to be completed by mid-2001, will evaluate the At-Large experience 
          to date, including the registration process just completed and the unanticipated 
          level of interest shown, as well as the actual experience of the initial 
          At-Large election processes. The results of the study will guide the 
          ICANN Board in establishing a permanent direction for the At-Large membership. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">"Even though it is clear that some 
          of those who registered were prompted to do so by outreach efforts that 
          significantly overstated the scope and significance of ICANN's technical 
          functions related to the domain name system, members of the ICANN Board 
          and staff are gratified to see that there are a considerable number 
          of Internet users who are willing to take the time and make the effort 
          to participate in the ICANN process," said ICANN President and CEO Mike 
          Roberts.</font></p>

          coalition of the Internet's business, technical, academic, and user 
          communities, ICANN is assuming responsibility for a set of technical 
          functions previously performed under U.S. government contract by <a href="http://www.iana.org">IANA</a> 
          and other groups. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Specifically, ICANN coordinates the
