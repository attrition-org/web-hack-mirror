      <P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial">ICANN and U.S. Government
      Agree to Extend Agreements</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(4 September 2000) ICANN announced today
      that its agreements with the United States Government will be
      extended for up to one year. Under the agreements, the first
      of which was entered in November 1998, the U.S. Government and
      ICANN have been engaged in a transition of selected Internet
      technical-management functions (such as the domain-name system)
      to the private sector. The extensions are necessary to allow
      ICANN and its constituent organizations to complete the privatization
      of these functions, and were approved by the ICANN Board at its
      meeting on 30 August 2000.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Under a <A HREF="/general/icann-mou-25nov98.htm">Memorandum
      of Understanding</A> (MOU) reached between ICANN and the U.S.
      Department of Commerce in November 1998, the parties agreed to
      work jointly on a series of tasks necessary to complete the privatization.
      The parties originally anticipated that the tasks would be completed
      in approximately two years and scheduled a completion date of
      30 September 2000. In a <A HREF="../general/statusreport-30jun00.htm">progress
      report on the MOU</A> submitted to the Department of Commerce
      in June 2000, ICANN gave a detailed account of progress on the
      privatization tasks, noting that many of them have been completed
      but that some work remains to be done on a few others. The tasks
      remaining to be completed include:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">the <A HREF="/tlds/application-process-03aug00.htm">process
        for evaluation and possible creation of new Internet top-level
        domains</A> (TLDs);</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">the completion of composition of the ICANN
        Board by <A HREF="http://members.icann.org/">selection of Directors

        root-nameserver system</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">;</FONT>
        <LI><A HREF="../general/statusreport-30jun00.htm#Task1"><FONT FACE="Arial">formalization
        of contractual relationships between ICANN and the regional Internet

        and</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">establishment of <A HREF="/yokohama/cctld-topic.htm">stable
        arrangements between ICANN and the organizations responsible
        for the operation of country-code TLDs</A> (ccTLDs).</FONT>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Under the agreement, the MOU is extended
      to 30 September 2001 or sooner if ICANN and the U.S. Government
      agree that the work under the MOU has been completed. In addition
      to being extended, the MOU is being revised to recognize ICANN's
      progress by narrowing the list of remaining tasks. The arrangement
      as modified and extended assumes that a gradual transition will
      continue, with policy and operational responsibilities transferred
      from the U.S. Government to ICANN as the various remaining tasks
      are completed. Among the areas to be transitioned is responsibility
      for operational coordination of the root-nameserver system. With
      respect to ccTLDs, ICANN will assume the authority to perform
      under contracts with ccTLD organizations once those agreements
      are reached.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Also included in the agreed extensions
      are two subsidiary agreements: a <A HREF="/committees/dns-root/crada.htm">Cooperative
      Research and Development Agreement</A> (CRADA) between ICANN
      and the U.S. Department of Commerce for enhancements to the root-nameserver
      system and a <A HREF="../general/iana-contract-09feb00.htm">contract
      for operation of the Internet Assigned Number Authority</A> (IANA).
      The CRADA is being extended for one year; the IANA contract extension
      results from ICANN's acceptance of a new provision in the contract
      allowing the U.S. Government unilaterally to extend the period
      of performance by up to six months.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mike Roberts, ICANN's President and CEO,
      noted that, in agreeing to the extension, the U.S. Government
      has recognized the enormous strides that the Internet community
      has made since late 1998 in demonstrating its ability to perform
      the functions being transitioned to the private sector. According
      to Roberts, &quot;We have made much progress, and the end is
      in sight. With the continuing support of the U.S. Government
      and the Internet community as a whole, we expect to complete
      the remaining transition tasks without the need for additional
      extensions.&quot;</FONT></P>
