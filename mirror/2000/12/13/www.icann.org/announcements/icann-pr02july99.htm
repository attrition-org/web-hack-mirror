CORPORATION FOR ASSIGNED NAMES AND NUMBERS (ICANN) STATEMENT ON

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>

<p>INTERNET CORPORATION FOR ASSIGNED NAMES AND NUMBERS (ICANN)
STATEMENT ON HACKING OF NETWORK SOLUTIONS' SERVERS</p>

<p>Marina Del Rey, CA (July 2, 1999) - For several hours earlier
today, access to the server which hosts the ICANN Web site was
disrupted. The information on ICANN's Web site is administrative
in nature and was not damaged.</p>

<p>We have since been made aware of a concerted effort to tamper
with some of the servers currently operated by Network Solutions,
Inc. of Herndon, Virginia. The incident, which is potentially
criminal, has been referred to the appropriate law enforcement
officials. An investigation into the source of the attack, and
the manner in which it was carried out, is currently underway.
While there is no evidence that the servers under its control
have been harmed, ICANN is taking the appropriate measures to
protect its equipment located at the Information Sciences
Institute of the University of Southern California.</p>

<p>ICANN condemns this action as an attempt to undermine the
stability of the domain name system and will cooperate fully with
any investigation into the matter.</p>

<p>About ICANN: The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers (ICANN) is the new non-profit corporation that was formed
to take over responsibility for the IP address space allocation,
protocol parameter assignment, domain name system management, and
root server system management functions now performed under U.S.
Government contract by IANA and other entities.</p>
