  <h4>Preliminary Report <br>
    on the August 12 Special Meeting of the<br>
    ICANN Initial Board of Directors </h4>

  <p align="center"><b><i>ICANN Board Clarifies DNSO Constituency Representation</i></b></p>
  <p align="left">After taking account of all comments received and modifying 
    the <a href="../dnso/dnso-nc-amendments.htm">proposed amendments</a> 
    accordingly, the ICANN Board of Directors unanimously adopted the following 
    resolutions at its special meeting today: </p>
  </div>
<blockquote> RESOLVED, that Section 2(a) of Article VI-B of the Bylaws of the 
  Corporation is hereby replaced in its entirety with the following: 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>"The NC shall consist of representatives, selected in accordance with Section 
      3(c) of this Article, from each Constituency recognized by the Board pursuant 
      to the criteria set forth in Section 3 of this Article." </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>FURTHER RESOLVED, that Section 3(c) of Article VI-B of the Bylaws of the 
    Corporation is hereby replaced in its entirety with the following: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Each Constituency shall select up to three individuals to represent that 
      Constituency on the NC, no two of whom may be citizens of the same Geographic 
      Region, as defined in Article V, Section 6, except that, with the consent 
      of the Board, this latter requirement may be suspended for the term of a 
      particular individual upon a showing that it is impracticable for the Constituency 
      to obtain such geographic diversity. Any such waiver shall be granted only 
      upon a commitment by the constituency to a substantive plan to diversify 
      its membership, thereby minimizing the likelihood of the need for future 
      waivers from the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Constituency may 
      have more representatives on the NC than there are members of the Constituency." 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The formal minutes of this special meeting will be posted shortly.</p>
<p align="left">Given the lengthy period of time and extensive public comment 
  since this matter was first discussed at ICANN's May meetings in Berlin, and 
  because of the need of the DNSO Names Council for prompt clarification of its 
  membership structure prior to its next scheduled meeting in Santiago, the ICANN 
  Initial Board adopted these Bylaws amendments at its special meeting today.</p>
<p align="left">As was announced last month, the ICANN Initial Board has decided 
  to open its <a href="http://www.icann.org/santiago/santiago-details.htm">next 
  quarterly Board meeting in Santiago</a> to public observation and Internet webcasting. 
  <a href="http://www.icann.org/santiago/santiago-details.htm"> </a> The Board 
  addresses significant Internet policy issues at its quarterly meetings, not 
  on special meeting teleconferences. </p>
