      <P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial">ICANN Welcomes Positive
      Report from U.S. General Accounting Office</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(July 7, 2000) The Internet Corporation
      for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) welcomed today's release
      of a <A HREF="../general/gao-report-07jul00.pdf">report by the
      United States General Accounting Office</A> that confirms the
      legality and propriety of ICANN's formation and its relationship
      with the U.S. Department of Commerce.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;After an exhaustive study and careful
      legal analysis, the GAO has concluded that ICANN's project partnership
      with the U.S. government rests on a strong and secure legal foundation,&quot;
      said ICANN President and CEO Mike Roberts. &quot;We welcome its
      findings, which are consistent with the actions ICANN has taken
      over the past year and a half.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;It's nice to see some independent,
      authoritative validation of ICANN's sound legal footing,&quot;
      said Esther Dyson, chairman of ICANN's board of directors. &quot;The
      challenge for all those involved in the ICANN process is to build
      on that foundation. ICANN is a platform for the Net's diverse
      communities fo work together to develop policies for themselves
      in a structure that is stable, open, transparent, and consensus-based.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The <A HREF="http://www.gao.gov/">General
      Accounting Office</A> is the investigative arm of the U.S. Congress.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Also today, ICANN released its second status
      report to the U.S. Department of Commerce, available on the ICANN
      website at<BR>
      &lt;<A HREF="../general/statusreport-30jun00.htm">http://www.icann.org/general/statusreport-30jun00.htm</A>&gt;.
      The status report outlines ICANN's progress toward meeting the
      goals defined in the joint memorandum of understanding between
      the Department of Commerce and ICANN, and spells out the next
      steps to complete the transition to private-sector technical
      management of the Internet's naming and numbering systems.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">About ICANN</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
      and Numbers (ICANN) is a technical coordination body for the
      Internet. Created in October 1998 by a broad coalition of the
      Internet's business, technical, academic, and user communities,
      ICANN is assuming responsibility for a set of technical functions
      previously performed under U.S. government contract by IANA and
      other groups.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Specifically, ICANN coordinates the assignment
      of the following identifiers that must be globally unique for
      the Internet to function:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Internet domain names</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">IP address numbers</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">protocol parameter and port numbers</FONT>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In addition, ICANN coordinates the stable
      operation of the Internet's root server system.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As a non-profit, private-sector corporation,
      ICANN is dedicated to preserving the operational stability of
      the Internet; to promoting competition; to achieving broad representation
      of global Internet communities; and to developing policy through
      private-sector, bottom-up, consensus-based means. ICANN welcomes
      the participation of any interested Internet user, business,
      or organization. See <A HREF="../index.html">http://www.icann.org</A>.</FONT></P>
