      <P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial">Afternic.com Drops
      Lawsuit, Agrees to ICANN's Terms</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(July 7, 2000) The Internet Corporation
      for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) announced today that Afternic.com,
      Inc., has agreed to voluntarily <a href="http://www.icann.org/registrars/afternic-dismissal-07jul00.htm">
      dismiss its lawsuit</a> against ICANN,
      and to accept ICANN's terms under which a separate company, eXtraActive,
      would be accredited.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Under the agreement, Afternic.com will:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Drop its lawsuit against ICANN;</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Withdraw Afternic.com's application for
        registrar accreditation; and</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Substitute the registrar accreditation
        application of eXtraActive, an affiliate of Afternic.com that
        will be required to operate as a separate enterprise from Afternic.com.</FONT>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The terms of the agreement are identical
      to those <A HREF="/registrars/extraactive-agreement-06jul00.htm">offered
      by ICANN to Afternic.com on April 7, 2000</A>, approximately
      two months before Afternic.com filed its federal lawsuit against
      ICANN.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;Today's agreement represents a total
      vindication of ICANN's position. We are pleased that Afternic.com
      has agreed to resolve its dispute on ICANN's original terms,&quot;
      said ICANN President and CEO Mike Roberts. &quot;ICANN is committed
      to a fair, open, and consensus-based policy process; we do not
      look kindly on efforts to sidestep that process through litigation.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">According to Louis Touton, ICANN's general
      counsel, &quot;The agreement allows the accreditation of eXtraActive
      as a registrar, not Afternic, provided that the two entities
      are fully and actually separated in their operations. ICANN will
      be monitoring eXtraActive and Afternic.com very closely to ensure
      that the conditions of the agreement are met.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;Afternic.com's application for registrar
      accreditation presented a novel set of issues: Where an accredited
      registrar also acts as a domain name auctioneer, does the registrar
      have an obligation to protect against the use of its site for
      illegal cybersquatting? Should accredited registrars be able
      to use their privileged access to the authoritative registry
      database for the benefit of a domain name auction business, or
      should registrars be neutral intermediaries?&quot; said Andrew
      McLaughlin, ICANN's chief policy officer: &quot;By ending its
      lawsuit on ICANN's terms, Afternic.com has agreed to resolve
      these issues through the ICANN policy process, rather than in
      the US courts.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Background on Accreditation Process</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Since April of 1999, ICANN has accredited
      over 100 registrars as a way of introducing competition to the
      domain-name registration business. Under an agreement ICANN has
      entered with Network Solutions (which operates the central database
      for domain names ending with .com, .net, and .org), registrars
      accredited by ICANN have the ability to put names directly into
      the database. In accord with this privileged position, accredited
      registrars agree to abide by policies developed through the ICANN
      process in consultation with the Internet community.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">About ICANN</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
      and Numbers (ICANN) is a technical coordination body for the
      Internet. Created in October 1998 by a broad coalition of the
      Internet's business, technical, academic, and user communities,
      ICANN is assuming responsibility for a set of technical functions
      previously performed under U.S. government contract by IANA and
      other groups.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Specifically, ICANN coordinates the assignment
      of the following identifiers that must be globally unique for
      the Internet to function:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Internet domain names</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">IP address numbers</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">protocol parameter and port numbers</FONT>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In addition, ICANN coordinates the stable
      operation of the Internet's root server system.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As a non-profit, private-sector corporation,
      ICANN is dedicated to preserving the operational stability of
      the Internet; to promoting competition; to achieving broad representation
      of global Internet communities; and to developing policy through
      private-sector, bottom-up, consensus-based means. ICANN welcomes
      the participation of any interested Internet user, business,
      or organization. See <A HREF="../index.html">http://www.icann.org</A>.
