<P><center><b>ICANN Announces International Education and Public
Outreach Support in Collaboration with Alexander Ogilvy</b></center>

<P>Los Angeles, Calif. - The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers (ICANN) announced today that Alexander Ogilvy and its
parent company Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide will provide support
for its international education and public outreach programs.  The
firms' offices in major cities worldwide will assist the new
organization through a structured program of event support,
educational materials and media coordination.

<P>Esther Dyson, Interim Chairman of the ICANN Board, said "We're
looking forward to the ability to use the well-known strengths of
Alexander Ogilvy in our programs to reach and hear from the diverse
constituencies of ICANN.  Together, we can advance the goals of our
new organization in fostering strong and stable growth of the Internet
around the world."

<P>Routine press inquiries will now be handled through the Alexander
Ogilvy/Ogilvy contacts listed below.  Members of the ICANN Board and
staff will continue to make themselves available for interviews
concerning ICANN programs.

<P><b>About ICANN:</b>
<P>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is
a new, non-profit, international corporation formed to oversee a
select number of the Internet's core technical management functions.
Between now and September 2000, ICANN will take over responsibility
for coordinating domain name system management, IP address space
allocation, protocol parameter assignment, and root server system
management, a privatization called for the in U.S. Government's White
Paper on the Management of the Internet Domain Name System.

<P>In the past, many of these functions have been handled by the U.S.
government, or by its contractors and volunteers.  This informal
structure represented the spirit and culture of the research community
in which the Internet developed. However, the growing size and
international importance of the Internet has necessitated the creation
of a technical management body that is both more formalized in
structure, and more fully reflective of the geographic diversity of
the Internet community.

<P>ICANN is a non-profit corporation with an international board of
directors.  Its initial board is led by interim chairman Esther Dyson,
and has members drawn from several nations. This initial board is
completing ICANN's by-laws and procedures and working to pave the way
for a smooth and stable transition to private sector management of
technical management functions.  The day-to-day management of ICANN is
led by its interim President and CEO, Mike Roberts.  The initial board
members will be succeeded by board members elected by four different
constituency groups, collectively representing a broad range of the
Internet's technical and user communities around the globe.=
