      Institute as New Dispute Resolution Provider</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(May 15, 2000 - Marina del Rey, California,
      USA) -- The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
      (ICANN) announced today that the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution
      has been designated an approved provider under their Uniform
      Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) for domain name disputes. CPR
      will begin accepting complaints on Monday, 22 May 2000. For the
      first two months of operation it will commence a maximum of twenty
      proceedings per month.<BR>
<BR>
      CPR, a widely respected alliance of 500 general counsel of global
      corporations and partners of major law firms, is the fourth dispute
      resolution provider to be designated by ICANN to handle domain
      disputes, joining the National Arbitration Forum, the Disputes.org/eResolution
      Consortium, and the World Intellectual Property Organization.
       The members of the CPR Domain Name Disputes Panel are listed
      at the CPR website, see <A HREF="http://www.cpradr.org/">http://www.cpradr.org</A>.<BR>

      The UDRP was adopted in August 1999 and placed into effect by
      all competitive registrars in .com, .org and .net during December
      1999 - January 2000. It establishes a streamlined, economical
      process administered by neutral arbitration companies to provide
      a quick and cheap alternative to litigation. The procedure applies
      to cases that meet all three of the following criteria:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The domain name must be identical or confusingly
        similar to a name in which the complaining party has trademark
        rights (either through a registered trademark or a common-law
        trademark).</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The domain name holder must have no legitimate
        right or interest in the name.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The domain name must have been registered
        and used in bad faith.</FONT>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In its first few months of operation, the
      UDRP has proven to be a very popular means of quickly resolving
      trademark/domain name disputes. To date, 691 proceedings have
      been commenced under the policy involving 1022 domain names.
       Of those proceedings, 348 have already been resolved.</FONT></P>
