      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Individuals planning on attending the ICANN
      meetings should immediately review the applicable visa requirements,
      as visas can be time-consuming to obtain. To determine your visa
      requirements, you should contact your local Japanese Consular
      Office or review the information at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/02.html">http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/02.html</A>&gt;.
      If a visa is necessary, you should complete the form at<BR>
      &lt;<A HREF="http://mc-net.jtbcom.co.jp/icann/vif.pdf">http://mc-net.jtbcom.co.jp/icann/vif.pdf</A>&gt;
      and return it to the ICANN-Yokohama Travel Assistance Desk according
      to the instructions at the top of the form. Please fill out the
      form carefully and completely, as the information provided will
      be used in the preparation of the support documents necessary
      for your visa application. Because the application process often
      takes more than one month, it is important that you return the
      completed Visa Information Form as soon as possible. For more
      information about Japan's visa requirements, see &lt;<A HREF="http://mc-net.jtbcom.co.jp/icann">http://mc-net.jtbcom.co.jp/icann</A>&gt;.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In connection with the Yokohama meetings,
      ICANN's Board of Directors and senior staff will be present in
      the Asia/Pacific region. As such, there is an excellent opportunity
      for ICANN to build better ties with Asia/Pacific Internet communities.
      In that spirit, the ICANN senior staff has made a commitment
      to visit various economies in the region to the extent feasible
      in July.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Internet communities that are interested
      in hosting meetings with ICANN staff or Directors should indicate
      their interest by email to Andrew McLaughlin &lt;<A HREF="mailto:%20%20ajm@icann.org">ajm@icann.org</A>&gt;
