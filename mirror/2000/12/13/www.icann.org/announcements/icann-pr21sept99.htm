  DOMAIN NAME REGISTRARS</font></b></i></h2>
<P><font face="Arial">(September 21, 1999) <a href="../index.html">The 
  Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a> (ICANN) announced today 
  that twelve additional applicant companies have met the criteria to be accredited 
  as registrars in the .com, .net, and .org domains.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">As accredited registrars, these twelve companies will compete 
  in the market for domain name registration services by participating in the 
  Shared Registry System (SRS), which allows multiple ICANN-accredited registrars 
  to register domain names ending in .com, .net, and .org. Under an agreement 
  announced August 6 by the U.S. Department of Commerce and Network Solutions, 
  Inc. (the developer of the SRS), new registrars that have signed the accreditation 
  agreement with ICANN will be eligible to join the five testbed registrars as 
  participants in the SRS's initial test phase. The testbed operation is currently 
  scheduled to conclude on September 30, 1999.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The twelve companies named today join the 64 companies that 
  have already been <a href="../registrars/accredited-list.html">accredited 
  by ICANN</a>, starting in April, 1999. Until the initial introduction of competitive 
  registration services in June, registration services in the .com, .net, and 
  .org domains were provided solely by Network Solutions, Inc., under a 1992 Cooperative 
  Agreement with the U.S. Government.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial"><b>ABOUT REGISTRAR ACCREDITATION </b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Under an October 6, 1998 amendment to the Cooperative Agreement 
  between Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) and the U.S. Government, the process of 
  opening the Internet Domain Name System's three largest domains to competition 
  was launched with a testbed phase that began on April 26. Five companies were 
  initially accredited to use the NSI Shared Registry System in a test operation 
  designed to ensure that the introduction of competition occurs in a smooth, 
  coordinated manner. The original testbed participants, all of which are now 
  offering registration services in competition with NSI, are: America Online; 
  CORE (Internet Council of Registrars); France Telecom/Ol&eacute;ane; Melbourne 
  IT; and register.com.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">By qualifying to be accredited as registrars in the .com, 
  .net, and .org top-level domains, the seven registrars named today join the 
  five original testbed registrars, as well as the 64 other companies that have 
  already qualified for ICANN accreditation. Under an agreement announced on August 
  6, 1999, the Shared Registry System testbed program has been expanded to extend 
  to all accredited registrars that sign the standard testbed registrar agreements 
  with NSI and meet technical certification requirements. For further details,
