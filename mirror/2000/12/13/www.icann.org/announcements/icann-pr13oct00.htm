        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">On Monday, 2 October 2000 the application
        period for those seeking to sponsor or operate new TLDs ended.
        A total of <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/tlds/tld-applications-lodged-02oct00.htm">47
        applications were received</A> during the application period.
        Fourty-four of these applications are still active.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN has completed the following steps
        in its review of applications:</FONT>
        <UL>
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Acknowledging receipt of applications.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Reviewing the applications to ensure they
          include all the required parts. All applications being considered
          now have all the required major parts, though some still appear
          to be missing exhibits, postable HTML versions, etc.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Verifying payment of the application fee.
          Two of the 47 applications submitted were not accompanied by
          the US $50,000 application fee. These two applications (.number/.tel/.phone
          and .wap) have been returned.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Performing an initial review of confidentiality
          requests and contacting applicants to notify them of the disposition
          of the request. One of the 47 applications (.nyc) has been withdrawn
          because the applicant and ICANN did not agree on treatment of
          confidentiality claims.</FONT>
        </UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN is currently involved in the following
        aspects of the review:</FONT>

          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Where an application seeks alternative
          or multiple TLD strings, <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/tlds/new-tld-application-instructions-15aug00.htm#VIII">verifying
          that it is a single application</A> (i.e. that all parts of the
          application apply, without significant variation, to all of the
          strings). Applicants submitting materials that constitute more
          than one application will be notified in the next several days.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Posting non-confidential portions of <A

          as soon as possible. In some cases, we are awaiting resolution
          of confidentiality claims so that we can post the application
          material for public comment. In other cases, we are working to
          correct problems with the electronic versions of applications
          that were submitted. We expect the majority of the posting to
          be completed soon.</FONT>
