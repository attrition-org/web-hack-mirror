<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Since the implementation of the Internet
domain-name system in the 1980s, the specifications published
and implemented by the Internet community have not permitted labels
making up domain names to have trailing hyphens (e.g., &quot;example-.com&quot;).
Througout this period, the specifications for the format of domain
names have been well-known throughout the Internet technical community.
They have been set forth in several RFCs, including <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1035.txt">RFC
1035</A> (published in 1987) and <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1123.txt">RFC
1123</A> (published in 1989). The commonly accepted specifications
are reflected in the <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hollenbeck-rrp-00.txt">functional
specification for the Shared Registry System</A>, through which
competitive registrar services were introduced in the .com/.net/.org
top-level domains last year, which requires that labels end with
letters or digits, not hyphens.<BR>
<BR>
In the past several weeks, however, over 800 domain names with
labels containing trailing hyphens were registered by mistake
in the .com/.net/.org registry. These names do not conform to
the the functional specification under which the .com/.net/.org
registry is operated. The registry software in use before January
3, 2000, however, permitted registrars to enter these malformatted
names into the registry, and some registrars' software similarly
failed to screen out requests to register these names. Promptly
upon learning that these names had been registered, the registry
operator (<A HREF="http://www.nsiregistry.com/">NSI-Registry</A>)
revised the software to reject additional requests to register
names of this format.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN supports these corrections to maintain
the stability of the Internet. At the ICANN annual meeting on
November 4, 1999, the ICANN Board <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/nsi/nsi-agreements.htm">approved
a package of agreements</A> among NSI, ICANN, the United States
Department of Commerce, and the ICANN-accredited registrars. Those
agreements require any names that are registered to comply with
the format specified in the registry's functional specification.
They also provide that those registering domain names must agree
to cancellation of the registration in the event of a registry
or registrar mistake, and in the case of every one of the trailing-hyphen
names the registering party did in fact have such an agreement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The use of domain names in this noncompliant
format presents interoperability problems. The documented format
is well-known throughout the Internet technical community. Among
other things, domain names that violate this format have the potential
of causing software written in reliance on these formats to malfunction,
and several instances of actual malfunctions have been identified.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The U.S. Government's <A HREF="../general/white-paper-05jun98.htm">Statement 
  of Policy on the Management of Internet Names and Addresses</A>, 63 Fed. Reg. 
  31741 (June 10, 1998) (commonly known as the &quot;White Paper&quot;) specifies 
  that preserving the stability of the Internet should be the first priority of 
  any DNS management system. A second principle that the White Paper states should 
  guide DNS-management activities is the promotion of competition in the provision 
  of registration services.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">After consultation among ICANN, NSI-Registry,
and the registrars involved, notices have been given to the registering
parties that these names were accepted and registered by mistake
and will be cancelled. These cancellations reflect implementation
of longstanding policy, rather than adoption of any new policy.
ICANN commends NSI-Registry and the registrars involved for working
constructively within the competitive framework adopted at the
March and November 1999 ICANN meetings to effectively and promptly
address this challenge to Internet stability. This sort of commitment
to stability and competition will continue and expand the many
public benefits the Internet has brought.</FONT></P>
