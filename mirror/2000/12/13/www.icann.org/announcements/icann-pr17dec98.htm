<P>LOS ANGELES, December 17, 1998 -- The Internet Corporation for
Assigned
Names and Numbers is pleased to announce that the following individuals
have been appointed to the ICANN Membership Advisory Committee:

<P>-Izumi Aizu (Asia Network Research; Asia &amp; Pacific Internet
Association;
Malaysia/Japan)
<BR>-Diane Cabell (Fausett, Gaeta &amp; Lund, LLP; United States)
<BR>-George Conrades, chairman (ICANN; United States)
<BR>-Greg Crew (ICANN; Australia)
<BR>-Pavan Duggal (Cyberlaw Consultant; India)
<BR>-Kanchana Kanchanasut (Asian Institute of Technology; Thailand)
<BR>-Daniel Kaplan (Consultant; Internet Society France; France)

<BR>-Dan Steinberg (Open Root Server Confederation; Canada)
<BR>-Tadao Takahashi (Internet Society Brazil; Brazil)
<BR>-Jonathan Zittrain, non-voting liaison to Berkman Center membership
study (Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School;
United States)

<P>Expressions of interest were received from over eighty individuals
who responded to ICANN's invitation for expressions of interest, which
was posted on the ICANN website on November 25 and distributed to
relevant mailing lists--including the list associated with the
International Forum on the White Paper.

<P>Those selected meet the goals of constructing a committee that both
is geographically diverse and includes a wide variety of interests and
perspectives.&nbsp; The board appreciates the willingness of so many
people to participate in this important activity and encourages all to
continue to participate as a key source of feedback and expertise for
the committee.

<P>This committee, called for in the ICANN bylaws, will advise the
ICANN board on the creation of an at-large membership structure.&nbsp;
The committee's work will begin immediately; it is scheduled to report
on its progress at the next ICANN meeting, planned for Singapore March
2-4.

<P>One of the committee's first tasks will be defining its work plan
and methods.&nbsp; Among other things, it will determine how to
involve the public in its work, especially all the volunteers who are
not part of the formal committee, while striving to accomplish its
objectives as soon as possible.

<P>The committee will be working in conjunction with the Berkman
Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School--which, along
with other support to ICANN, is undertaking a study of membership
issues.

<P>Thanks to all of the enthusiastic and qualified individuals who
expressed interest in joining the committee.
