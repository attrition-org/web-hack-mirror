        <P> <font face="Arial"><b>Marina del Rey, CA and Garden City, NY, September 
          21, 2000</b> - The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers 
          (ICANN), the technical coordination body for the Internet, and <i><a href="http://www.election.com">election.com</a></i>, 
          a leading global Internet election company, announced today that <i>election.com</i> 
          will conduct ICANN's first worldwide online vote. ICANN's <a href="http://members.icann.org">At-Large

          the world's largest all-Internet votes to date.<br>
          <br>
          Since this is ICANN's first online vote, we needed a company that could 
          provide assurance of reliable security for the balloting as well as 
          experience in working with a diverse, global online membership," said 
          Esther Dyson, Chairman of the ICANN Board. "Among the several voting 
          system proposals we considered, we were impressed by <i>election.com's</i> 
          track record and international experience, and its commitment to security. 
          In addition, <i>election.com</i> was willing to work with us on a process 
          unprecedented in its geographic breadth. Overall, <i>election.com</i> 
          was simply the best match for ICANN's needs."<br>
          <br>

          The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a 
          technical coordination body for the Internet. Created in October 1998 
          by a broad coalition of the Internet's business, technical, academic 
          and user communities, ICANN is assuming responsibility for a set of 
          technical functions previously performed under the US government contract 
          by IANA and other groups. As a non-profit, private-sector corporation, 
          ICANN is dedicated to preserving the operational stability of the Internet; 
          to promoting competition; to achieving broad representation of global 
          Internet communities; and to developing policy through private-sector, 
          bottom-up, consensus-based means.<br>
