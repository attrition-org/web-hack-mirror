      Council Warns Pre-Registration of Speculative New Domain Names
      Is Premature</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">September 29, 2000 -- Commenting on the
      process for establishing new top-level domain names (TLDs) the
      Names Council of the Domain Name Supporting Organization (DNSO)
      emphasizes that no new TLDs have been selected as of this date
      and no one is authorized to pre-register names. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Noting that some companies are claiming
      to offer pre-registration services to consumers who may wish
      to register in the new TLDs, the Names Council has issued the
      following statement. &quot;The Names Council feels it is premature
      for companies to offer pre-registration services for domain names
      in speculative new TLDs. To date, no new TLDs have been selected
      and there is no guarantee that any particular organization will
      be authorized to take registrations for any particular TLD. The
      registration of names in new TLDs will be done on a fair basis,
      and the practice of pre-registration should not be encouraged.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Names Council statement was made following
      its meeting on the 21 September 2000, at which the Council welcomed
      ICANN's initiative to invite proposals for new top level domains.
      With the application process well under way the Names Council
      considers it may be helpful to the Internet community to outline
      the process and its associated time line.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">At its meeting in July 2000 in Yokohama,
      Japan, the Board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
      and Numbers (ICANN) adopted a plan to receive and evaluate proposals
      to operate or sponsor new TLDs. These names will complement existing
      TLDs such as &quot;.com&quot;.  No selections of any new TLD
      strings have yet been made, nor has any decision been made regarding
      the number that will be introduced. The application process will
      close on 2 October 2000 and ICANN will publish (via its web site
      http://www.icann.org) all applications soon afterward. Members
      of the Internet community will have at least a two-week period
      to comment on the proposals. ICANN then expects to enter into
      dialogue with a short-list of applicants to ensure that the growth
      of the Internet is undertaken in a stable and controlled manner.
