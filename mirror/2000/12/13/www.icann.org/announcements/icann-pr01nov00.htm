      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">On Monday, 2 October 2000 the application
      period for those seeking to sponsor or operate new TLDs ended.
      A total of <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/tlds/tld-applications-lodged-02oct00.htm">47
      applications were received</A> during the application period.
      Forty-four of these applications are still active.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Tasks That Have Been Completed</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN has completed the following steps
      in its review of applications:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Acknowledging receipt of applications.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Reviewing the applications to ensure they
        include all the required parts. All applications being considered
        now have all the required major parts, although some still appear
        to be missing exhibits, postable HTML versions, etc.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Verifying payment of the application fee.
        Two of the 47 applications submitted were not accompanied by
        the US $50,000 application fee. These two applications (.number/.tel/.phone
        and .wap) have been returned.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Reviewing confidentiality requests and
        contacting applicants to notify them of the disposition of the
        request. One of the 47 applications (.nyc) was withdrawn because
        the applicant and ICANN did not agree on treatment of confidentiality
        claims. All other confidentiality claims have been resolved by
        agreement. In general, ICANN agreed to treat only a very limited
        portion of application materials as confidential.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Completing posting of non-confidential
        portions of <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/tlds/index.html">applications
        on the ICANN web site</A>.</FONT><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">
        </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">We have now posted all of the basic
        application materials, though a few partial omissions are still
        being addressed.</FONT>
      </UL>

      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Tasks Currently Underway</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN is currently involved in the following
      aspects of the review:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The <A HREF="/mbx/tldapps/">web-based
        public comment forum</A> is currently collecting public comments
        on the applications. In nineteen days of operation, over 3000
        comments have been submitted. We are reviewing and digesting
        the comments.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Technical, business/financial, and legal
        review of applications.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Where an application seeks alternative
        or multiple TLD strings, <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/tlds/new-tld-application-instructions-15aug00.htm#VIII">verifying
        that it is a single application</A> (i.e. that all parts of the
        application apply, without significant variation, to all of the
        strings). Applicants submitting materials that constitute more
        than one application will be notified in the near future.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">We have begun sending questions out to
        many of the applicants. As responses are received, we will post
        the questions and responses with the application materials.</FONT>

         FACE="Arial"> The results of the staff review of the applications
        will be posted on approximately 8 November 2000. We expect these
        results to be presented in a detailed report, including an explanation
        of the goals of the analysis, a detailed statement of how the
        analysis was performed, identification of those who participated
        in the review process, summaries of findings as to each application,
        compilations of comparative data on the applications, observations
        regarding how the posted criteria for evaluation apply, and other
        relevant results of the analysis.</FONT>

         FACE="Arial">A second web-based public comment forum will be
        established at the time the Staff Report is issued to allow the
        public to comment on the report. The second forum will also permit
        persons wishing to make their own comments on the applications
        to do so.</FONT>

      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Legal Claims Concerning TLDs</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">We continue to receive various correspondence
      concerning additional legal claims concerning TLDs. We are preparing
      responses that we will <A HREF="/tlds/correspondence/">post</A>
      along with the correspondence asserting the claims.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Avoiding Conflicts of Interest</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is important that persons having financial
      interests in the applicants not be involved in making selections
      among the applications. Accordingly, the members of ICANN's Board
      of Directors (who will vote on the selections) and its officers
      and employees (who will be advising the Board on the selections)
      have reviewed whether they have any relationship to applicants
      or applications that would make their participating in the selection
      inappropriate. Based on this review, the following persons recused
      themselves prior to their consideration of any application:</FONT></P>
