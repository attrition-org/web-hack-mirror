<P><B>ICANN Board Announces Public Meeting </B>

<P>The Board of Directors of the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (ICANN) is pleased to invite any interested party to
a special open public meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA on
Saturday, November 14, 1998, commencing at 9 am and concluding at 4
pm.
 
<P>The purpose of the meeting is to let the new ICANN Board hear the
views and concrete suggestions of the Internet community on matters of
current importance to the work of ICANN. The Board members wish to
understand the issues and to engage in open dialogue on ways to
achieve the goals of the U.S. government's White Paper.

<P>We are developing an agenda.  It will be posted at the www.iana.org
web site by Monday, November 2, along with information on the location
of the meeting.  The closest international airport to the meeting
location is Boston's Logan airport.

<P>The Board wishes to express its appreciation to the organizers of
the previously scheduled Domain Name Support Organization (DNSO)
meeting in Monterrey, Mexico for their willingness to adjust their
meeting agenda so that attendees wishing to participate in both
meetings can do so. Information on the DNSO meeting can be found at
