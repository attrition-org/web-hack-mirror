<H2><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN Launches Membership Web Site
for Individual Internet Users</FONT></CENTER></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Marina del Rey, CA, USA (25 February 2000)
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
announces the launch of its At Large Membership web site.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">After considerable public input, the ICANN
Board has developed this program as a new way for Internet users
from all over the globe to participate directly in the ICANN process
and help ensure the smooth coordination of the Internet's technical
infrastructure. Individuals can begin registering today to become
ICANN members at <A HREF="http://members.icann.org/">http://members.icann.org</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The At Large Membership of ICANN will give
individual members of Internet communities worldwide a voice in
the selection of Directors to the ICANN Board.  By becoming an
ICANN member, individuals will have an opportunity to become part
of the ICANN &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach to making policy concerning
Internet Names and Addresses. ICANN members will be able to receive
regular news, updates and announcements about ICANN activities
and policy initiatives.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The basic requirements for applying to become
an ICANN At Large member are:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">*       The completion of an online membership
application,<BR>
*       A working Internet email address; and<BR>
*       A single physical residence verified by a postal mail
address.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thanks to a grant from the Markle Foundation,
the initial launch of ICANN's At Large Membership program has
been funded without the need for membership dues.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The ICANN Board will consider and adopt
further policy about composition and structure of the At Large
Membership, and to establish rules for the nomination and election
of candidates for the At Large Council, at the Board's next meeting,
to be held March 9-10. It is hoped that the target goal of 5000
members can be reached in the next few weeks in order to move
forward with the At Large Elections later this year.</FONT></P>
