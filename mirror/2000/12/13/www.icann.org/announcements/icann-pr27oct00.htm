      of Directors to Serve Extended Term</FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Marina del Rey, California, USA (27 October
      2000) - The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
      (ICANN) announced today the names of four of its original nine
      Directors who will serve extended terms until November 2002.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Directors with extended terms are Frank
      Fitzsimmons, Hans Kraaijenbrink, Jun Murai, and Linda Wilson.
      At the conclusion of the ICANN annual meeting on 16 November
      2000, they will be joined by newly elected At Large Directors
      Karl Auerbach, Ivan Moura Campos, Masanobu Katoh, Andy Mueller-Maguhn,
      and Nii Quaynor to comprise the At Large component of the ICANN
      Board of Directors. Nine other Directors are selected by ICANN
      Supporting Organizations for Domain Names, Addresses, and Protocols.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The five original Directors who will be
      leaving the Board after the annual meeting on November 16th are
      Chairman Esther Dyson, Geraldine Capdeboscq, George Conrades,
      Greg Crew, and Eugenio Triana.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The extended terms for four of the original
      Directors are part of a plan for ICANN At Large membership that
      was adopted by the Board at its March and July 2000 meetings
      in Cairo and Yokohama. The decision on those who would accept
      extended terms was made by the nine original Directors.</FONT></P>
