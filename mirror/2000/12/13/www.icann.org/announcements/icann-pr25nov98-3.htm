<BR>BRUSSELS, 25 November 1998 - Responding to the increasingly global
nature of the Internet, the US government recently decided<BR>
to transfer responsibility of the Internet's core standards and
technical
administration from the incumbent Internet Assigned<BR>
Numbers Authority (IANA), which is acting under US Government
contract,
to a new, membership-based multinational body, the<BR>
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN
announced
today that it has been advised by the U.S.<BR>
Government that the Government will shortly enter into a memorandum of
understanding pursuant to which ICANN will become<BR>
responsible for matters referenced in ICANN's incorporating documents.
An announcement is expected on Monday.<BR>
<BR>
Representatives of industry, business and the different European
communities
of Internet users met the Initial Board of ICANN today<BR>
in Brussels at a gathering hosted by the European Commission to
explore
the ways in which the management of the Internet's<BR>
technical foundations will evolve.<BR>
<BR>
ICANN, a private, international non-profit corporation, is hoping to
administer
the policies and technical protocols that let Internet<BR>
communications be routed to the correct place anywhere on the
globe. Its

proposed duties include those now performed by IANA,<BR>
which include managing the Domain Name System, or DNS.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
"The purpose of ICANN is to operate as a world-wide, consensual
non-governmental
body to replace the primarily American<BR>
arrangements under which the Internet's standards and protocols have
hitherto
been managed", said Ms Esther Dyson, ICANN's<BR>
Interim Chairman.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
"I am glad we had this opportunity to discuss issues with European
Internet
users and stakeholders", said Ms Dyson. "We want to be<BR>
a truly global organisation. Our immediate aim is to ensure ICANN
reflects
the needs and wishes of the many Internet communities<BR>
wherever on this planet they might be. Today's meeting was a necessary
step to ensure ICANN can truly meet this aspiration".&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
With its new bylaws, ICANN is a fully accountable corporation,
answerable
through a Board that will be elected by a broad<BR>
membership acting through four different membership pools representing
the many different Internet communities around the globe.<BR>
Accountability and continuity are reflected in ICANN's design: the job
of its Initial Board, including Interim President and CEO,<BR>
Michael Roberts, is to set up the permanent structures that will allow
ICANN to set policies responsibly and with the full participation<BR>
of all interested parties. Reflecting their architect's jobs, the
Initial
Board including the Interim President will depart once ICANN is<BR>
built. In the words of Hans Kraaijenbrink, the Dutch ICANN Initial
Board

Member, "we are setting up structures. [Our constituencies]<BR>
will have to suggest policies".<BR>
<BR>
Today's meeting, the second in a series that started in Massachusetts
on

14 November and will continue in Asia in March 1999, had<BR>
one overriding aim, according to Ms Dyson. "Our first step is to start
communicating with the different Internet communities. We need<BR>
to get three things done - for the Board to get to know the
communities
and vice-versa, to learn about the issues we as a Board will<BR>
be facing and to generate concrete proposals about key issues. We hope
to gain people's trust by the way we go about this - openly<BR>
and interactively".&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
The latter is a crucial point. ICANN's membership pools comprise four
different
groups. One represents the Internet's end users,<BR>
while the three others, known as Supporting Organisations (SO), are
best

thought of as functional constituencies representing<BR>
addressing (the numbers, like 128.9.128.127, which software
translates

into domain names that humans can remember, like<BR>
www.icann.org), domain names (the system of names, especially the
top-level
domain suffixes such as .com, .org, or .net), and<BR>
protocols (the grammar that lets computers running under many
different
standards talk to each other).&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
"Our key governance issue is how to be truly responsive and
transparent
to a global community of users numbering in the hundreds<BR>
of millions", said Ms Dyson. "The supporting organisations will have
to
create themselves - and convince the Board that they are<BR>
truly representative of their communities. Only then can they be
recognised
by the Board as ICANN Supporting Organisations." A<BR>
formal call to submit proposals for the creation of SOs will be made
in
mid-December.<BR>
<BR>
The pressures generated on the current DNS system by the explosive
commercial
growth of the Internet are huge. "Domain Names<BR>
are the hottest issue we face", said Mr Kraaijenbrink. "It is a
potential
time-bomb because commercial pressures may conflict with<BR>
stability".<BR>
<BR>
The solution, Ms Dyson said, was for all user constituencies to come
up
with a DNSO that is responsive to these conflicting interests.<BR>
"We have no positions [on domain name issues]", said Mr Triana, an
Initial
Board member from Spain. "It will be up to a DNSO to<BR>
suggest policies".<BR>
<BR>
The latest iteration of ICANN's bylaws, submitted to the
U.S. Department

of Commerce on Monday, will ensure that, whatever policies<BR>
are suggested, they will satisfy the majority of Internet
stakeholders.
Each SO will nominate three Directors to the ICANN Board.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
In Europe, the American nature of the arrangements under which ICANN
predecessor
IANA and Network Solutions, Inc. have hitherto<BR>
coordinated most of the global Internet have long been a source of
concern.
On 4 November, for example, Commissioner Martin<BR>
Bangemann wrote to U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley announcing
a Commission review of the U.S. Government agreement<BR>
with Network Solutions, Inc. on competition grounds. The Commission
has
thus expressed satisfaction at the moves to establish an<BR>
international Internet governance system. "The Commission welcomes the
progress that has been made", said Christopher<BR>
Wilkinson, an official with the directorate-general in charge of
telecommunications.
"Member states and the private sector had<BR>
already expressed widespread support for the new arrangements to
us". Ms

Dyson said that it was part of her Board's job to be "truly<BR>
responsive to European positions, along with those of the rest of the
world".
This is reflected in the composition of ICANN's Initial<BR>
Board, which includes three Europeans.<BR>
