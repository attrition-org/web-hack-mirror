      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(May 9, 2000) The Internet Corporation
      for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) today announced the appointment
      of <A HREF="../elcom/index.html">Election</A> and <A HREF="../nomcom/index.html">Nominating
      Committees</A> that will play key roles in the process by which
      five At Large Directors of ICANN will be selected later this
      year through a global online election.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The At Large Members of ICANN are individuals
      who have indicated an interest in participating in ICANN. They
      will vote to select five Directors for the ICANN Board, one from
      each of five defined geographic regions (Africa, Asia/Pacific,
      Europe, Latin America/Caribbean, and North America). With nearly
      15,000 applications so far, ICANN's At Large Membership outreach
      effort has been greeted with notable enthusiasm among the members
      of the global Internet community.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Today's announcement marks the beginning
      of the first phase of this selection process. The Nominating
      Committee will nominate a set of At Large candidates. At the
      same time, ICANN's Election Committee will solicit and select
      an outside vendor for the online voting system, and complete
      detailed recommendations for ICANN's campaign and voting procedures,
      including independent oversight and monitoring.</FONT></P>
