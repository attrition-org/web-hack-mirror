      ICANN At Large Nominations Period Nears Conclusion<BR>
      </FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The nominations period of ICANN's At Large
      membership election process will conclude tomorrow, September
      8, midnight GMT. September 8 also marks the deadline for membership
      applicants to activate their memberships, allowing them to cast
      ballots in this year's round of elections.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The next stage of the At Large process
      will be the voter education and dialogue phase. Starting September
      9, the ICANN website will feature a basic webpage for each nominee
      (including links to their own websites), and a Question &amp;
      Answer Forum to facilitate public dialogue among the nominees
      and the At Large members. The voting period will run from October
      1 - 10.</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Brief History of the Nominations Process</FONT></B>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The nominations process began in May 2000,
      when the <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/nomcom">Nominating Committee</A>
      issued a public open <A HREF="../nomcom/index.html#call">call
      for recommendations and expressions of interest</A>, along with
      its criteria of selection. Over the next two months, the NomCom
      received communications from over 400 individuals worldwide.
      On July 31, the Nominating Committee <A HREF="../nomcom/index.html#report">announced
      a set of 18 nominees</A>.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">On August 1, the <A HREF="http://members.icann.org/nom.html">member-nomination
      phase</A> began. A total of 161 individuals put their names forward
      as candidates for member-nomination: 3 in Africa; 24 in Asia/Australia/Pacific;
      74 in Europe; 7 in Latin America/Caribbean; and 53 in North America.
      Starting August 15, activated At Large members could make an
      endorsement of a candidate in their geographic region. Each candidate
      for member-nomination was given a basic webpage on the ICANN
      site (again, including links to homepages and candidate sites).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In order to encourage At Large members
      to examine the candidate pages, ICANN has sent a weekly email
      reminder to every activated member (4 emails total); in addition,
      ICANN has sent a weekly email to all unactivated membership applicants,
      encouraging them to activate their memberships to participate
      in this year's process. The objective of the candidate-webpages-plus-weekly-email-reminders
      communication strategy is to give members regular reminders to
      take part in the process, while (1) facilitating communication
      on equal terms for all candidates; (2) preventing the disclosure
      of members' personal information (such as email addresses) to
      candidates or others; (3) avoiding a flood of unsolicited email
      from many dozens of candidates; and (4) minimizing any communications
      advantages that might be enjoyed by candidates with access to
      greater financial resources.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">To be member-nominated, a candidate must
      receive the online endorsements of 2% of the activated members
      in his/her region (or 20 members, whichever is greater), from
      at least 2 different countries. Together with the nominees of
      the Nominating Committee, the member-nominees will appear on
      the October ballot, up to a maximum of 7 total nominees per region.
      The final ballot (including qualifying member-nominees) will
      be posted on September 9. Barring any last-minute surges in activations,
      it now appears that at least one candidate will qualify for member-nomination
      in each region.</FONT></P>

        Process</FONT></B>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The membership application phase launched
      on February 25, 2000, with a goal of 5,000-10,000 members. By
      the time of the July 31 deadline for applications, <A HREF="icann-pr31jul00.htm">over
      158,000</A> had been received. Applicants were required to give
      their personal name, along with a valid email address and valid
      physical address. For verification purposes, each applicant was
      sent a member number and password via email, and a PIN number
      via postal mail. To activate a membership, the applicant must
      enter each of those data elements. ICANN is continuing to conduct
      a careful review of the membership database.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">To date, over 75,000 members have activated
      worldwide, representing a remarkable accomplishment for a program
      whose original goal was at least 5,000 members.</FONT></P>
