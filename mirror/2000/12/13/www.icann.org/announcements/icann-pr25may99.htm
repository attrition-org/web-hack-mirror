<P>(May 25, 1999)  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) announced today that eight additional applicant companies have met its accreditation criteria and, upon completion of the ongoing testbed program, will be accredited to compete as registrars in the .com, .net, and .org domains. Currently, registration services in the .com, .net, and .org domains are provided by Network Solutions, Inc.

The eight companies named today will join the 5 already-accredited testbed registrars and the 29 post-testbed registrars that were announced by ICANN on April 21, 1999.

<P><B>ABOUT REGISTRAR ACCREDITATION</B>

<P>The 8 companies named today have qualified to be accredited upon the completion of the competitive registrar testbed program for the Shared Registry System in the .com, .net, and .org domains.  Under the Cooperative Agreement between NSI and the U.S. Government, the testbed program began on April 26 and is scheduled to last until June 24, 1999.  Following the conclusion of the testbed phase, the Shared Registry System for the .com, .net, and .org domains will be opened on equal terms to all accredited registrars, meaning that any company that meets ICANN’s standards for accreditation will be able to enter the market as a registrar and offer customers competitive domain name registration services in the .com, .net, and .org domains.  A FAQ on the registrar accreditation and testbed programs has been posted at <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/QANDA.htm">http://www.icann.org/QANDA.htm</A>
