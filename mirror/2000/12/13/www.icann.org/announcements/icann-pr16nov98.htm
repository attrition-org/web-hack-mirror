<CENTER><B>ICANN Holds First of Many Open Public Meetings</CENTER></B>
<BR>
<p>CAMBRIDGE, MA, Nov. 16, 1998 -- Over 200 members of the
international Internet community gathered here yesterday to advise and
question the initial board and management of the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers at the first of many open public
meetings to be held around the world. Others participated in the
Cambridge event through a real-time webcast and real-time email
comment.

<p>"It was a useful meeting, drawing together a broad swath of
internet stakeholders," said Jonathan Zittrain, Executive Director of
the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School,
which facilitated the meeting.  "For ICANN to succeed, it must be
responsive to the diverse voices heard--no easy task, but one that the
board has now shown it is willing to take up with energy and passion."
 
<p>Extensive notes, video and background materials from the all-day
meeting are posted at cyber.harvard.edu, the Berkman Center's web
site. A full transcript will be available in about a week.
 
<p>"This meeting had three broad purposes -- introducing the board to
the community and vice versa, trying to foster more consensus and
generating concrete proposals about governance issues such as
membership and board structure and accountability, and educating the
board about some of the issues we'll be facing," said interim ICANN
chairman Esther Dyson. "I'd say it was successful on all three counts,
with a lot of collaboration from all sides. We need to earn people's
trust over time, and I think we took a few useful steps in that
direction yesterday. People don't need to believe we'll do everything
they want, but they do need to believe we'll be fair and transparent
about what we do."

<p>"I think we now have the basis on which to move forward with a
transition agreement with the U.S. Government and to address the
lengthy list of ICANN action items," said ICANN interim president
Michael Roberts.

<p>ICANN initial board member Gregory Crew, speaking for the board's
advisory committee on membership, said that the input on these issues
was particularly useful. The staff of the Berkman Center will help the
committee in the formulation of formal membership options, which will
be posted for public comment prior to a board vote, as called for by
ICANN bylaws.
 
<p>Separately, ICANN noted that the process of Supporting Organization
recognition is moving forward, with criteria to be published by
yearend, after which applications will be accepted and posted for
public comment.
 
<p>Following its Cambridge premiere, ICANN is taking its show on the
road. Its second open public meeting will take place under the
auspices of the European Community Private Sector Panel of
Participants (EC-POP), hosted by the European Commission, in Brussels
on November 25. Another meeting will take place in Asia in March, time
and location to be announced shortly. Detailed information on these
and all other public meeting will be posted at www.iana.org, the web
site of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, ICANN's predecessor
organization.  ICANN's own www.icann.org will be operating soon.
