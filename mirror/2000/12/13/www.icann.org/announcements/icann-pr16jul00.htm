      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">New Top Level Domains</FONT></U></B><FONT
       FACE="Arial"> - The Board unanimously adopted the following
      schedule for the addition of new TLDs in a measured and responsible
      manner as recommended by the Domain Name Supporting Organization
      (DNSO) and public comment.</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">August 1, 2000 - ICANN to issue a formal

      </UL>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Data elements to be included in proposals:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">full information about the technical,
        business, management, and financial capabilities of the proposed
        operator of the registry;</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">a detailed description of the policies
        contemplated to promote orderly registration of names in the
        initial phases of introduction of the TLD;</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">full details concerning arrangements proposed
        to protect users in the event of registry failure; and</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">measures proposed for minimizing use of
        the TLD to carry out infringements or other abuses of intellectual
        property rights.</FONT>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Guidelines to be considered in assessing
      proposals for selection:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The need to maintain the Internet's stability,
        and especially the protection of domain-name holders from the
        effects of registry or registration-system failure.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The extent to which selection of the proposal
        would lead to an effective &quot;proof of concept&quot; concerning
        the introduction of top-level domains in the future, including
        the diversity the proposal would bring to the program, such as
        fully open top level domains, restricted and chartered domains
        with limited scope, noncommercial domains, and personal domains;
        and a variety of business models and geographic locations.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The enhancement of competition for registration
        services at the registry and registrar level.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The enhancement of the utility of the
        DNS.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The evaluation of delegation of policy-formulation
        functions for special-purpose TLDs to appropriate organizations.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The extent to which the proposal would
        meet previously unmet types of needs.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The importance of appropriate protections
        of rights of others, including intellectual property rights,
        in connection with the operation of the TLD, especially during
        the start-up phases.</FONT>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Board established an application fee
      of $50,000 USD. The fee is intended to cover the likely costs
      of the evaluation and approval process, and to ensure that the
      remainder of the ICANN community is not required to subsidize
      the new TLD application process.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">This action is the culmination of a process
      that has extended for more than five years and is intended to
      test the feasibility of the addition of new TLDs while maintaining
      the stability and integrity of the Internet.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">At Large Membership &amp; Elections</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Board finalized the process for initial
      selection of five Directors by its At Large Membership. Those
      Directors should be seated in time for ICANN's annual meeting
      in Los Angeles on November 13-14, 2000. Following is the election
      schedule adopted by the Board:</FONT></P>

      </UL>

      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Root Server System Enhancements</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The ICANN Board accepted the recommendation
      of its Root Server System Advisory Committee to submit, no later
      than the end of August 2000, a proposal to the United States
      Department of Commerce for the transition of the current root
      server system architecture to an enhanced architecture based
      on the use of a dedicated primary nameserver operated by ICANN.
      In addition the Board authorized the negotiation of agreements
      between ICANN and U.S. Department of Commerce for ICANN to assume
      responsibility for the maintenance and operation of various aspects
      of the root zone files.</FONT></P>

        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Revise its bylaws to publicize actions
        taken by the Board more quickly than was required in the past;
        in general actions taken by the Board shall be made available
        on a publicly accessible Internet World Wide Web site no later
        than five days after each meeting</FONT>
