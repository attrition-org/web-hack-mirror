  with interests in management of Internet Address space and related
  resources.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Address Supporting Organisation of
  ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)
  was established last year, and has assumed its responsibilities
  under the ICANN Bylaws for coordination of global policy development
  in relation to Internet Addresses and related resources. The
  nine-member Address Council has also been established, in accordance
  with the ASO MoU and ICANN Bylaws.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Since its establishment, the ASO has established
  mailing lists and a website to ensure that its processes are
  open and transparent, and accessible to all parties with an interest
  in Internet resource management issues.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Three ASO mailing lists are now available
  for public access to ASO information, and for input into the
  ASO process:</FONT></P>
