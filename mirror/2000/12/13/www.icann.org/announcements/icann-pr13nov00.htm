      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(13 November 2000) In a <A HREF="icann-pr10nov00-2.htm">10
      November 2000 Advisory</A>, ICANN reported that Economic Solutions,
      Inc. (ESI) had filed suit in United States District Court in
      St. Louis, Missouri, and sought a temporary restraining order
      from that court to prohibit ICANN from establishing a &quot;.biz&quot;
      or &quot;.ebiz&quot; top-level domain (TLD) or any other TLD
      that is similar to the country code for Belize, &quot;.bz.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">On 13 November, the <A HREF="/tlds/correspondence/esi-v-icann-13nov00.htm">court
      denied ESI's request for a temporary restraining order</A>. The
      court determined that ESI had not demonstrated that ICANN was
      subject to being sued in Missouri. The court also determined
      that ESI had failed to back up its claims on the merits:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Neither has plaintiff [ESI] demonstrated
        a likelihood of success on the merits of the Lanham Act and unfair
        competition claims, given the uncertain status of the claimed
        property rights in the &quot;.bz&quot; domain designation, the
        prospective and uncertain nature of possible establishment or
        use of assertedly competing TLDs, and questions concerning whether
        defendant's [ICANN's] role in the feared events could render
        it, as opposed to others actually employing the &quot;.biz&quot;
        or &quot;.ebiz&quot; designations, liable for false designation
        or unfair competition. As to plaintiff's tortuous interference
        claim, at this time defendant's proffered grounds for declining
        to take the administrative actions sought by plaintiff do not
        suggest a likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiff's
        claim. Furthermore, the tortuous interference claim and the allegations
        underlying it are unrelated to the substance of the TRO plaintiff
        seeks.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN applauds this decision preserving
      the integrity of the ongoing consensus-based process for moving
      toward the establishment of new TLDs.</FONT></P>
