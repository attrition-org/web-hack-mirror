<H2><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN Accredits Twelve New Domain
Name Registrars</FONT></CENTER></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(January 25, 2000) The Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) announced today that twelve
additional applicant companies have met the criteria to be accredited
as domain name registrars in the .com, .net, and .org domains.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">As accredited registrars, these companies
will compete in the market for domain name registration services
by participating in the Shared Registry System (SRS), which allows
multiple ICANN-accredited registrars to register domain names
ending in .com, .net, and .org.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The companies named today join the 98 companies
that were previously announced by ICANN, starting in April, 1999.
Until the initial introduction of competitive registration services
in June, registration services in the .com, .net, and .org domains
were provided solely by Network Solutions, Inc., under a 1992
Cooperative Agreement with the U.S. Government.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The 12 companies named today are:</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">ABOUT REGISTRAR ACCREDITATION</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Shared Registration System (&quot;SRS&quot;)
is a domain name registration system for competitive registrars
in the .com, .net, and .org top-level domains. The SRS was created
in the spring of 1999 through the initiative of the United States
Department of Commerce under an amendment to its cooperative agreement
with Network Solutions, Inc. Under this domain name registration
system, competing ICANN-accredited registrars register domain
names utilizing one shared, central registry operated and maintained
by NSI. Although there is no limit on the number of registrars
that may register names using the SRS, stability of the Internet
and continuity for consumers is protected by the requirement that
every business desiring to become a registrar in the .com, .net,
and .org top-level domains must become accredited for this purpose
by ICANN.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Under an October 6, 1998 amendment to the
Cooperative Agreement between Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) and
the U.S. Government, the process of opening the Internet domain
name system's largest and most widely used domains to competition
was launched with a testbed phase that began on April 26, 1999.
Five companies were initially accredited to use the SRS in a test
operation designed to ensure that the introduction of competition
occurs in a smooth, coordinated manner. By qualifying to be accredited
as registrars in the .com, .net, and .org top-level domains, the
twelve registrars named today join the five original testbed registrars,
as well as the 93 other companies that have already qualified
for ICANN accreditation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">On November 4, 1999, the ICANN Board approved
a new five-year <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/nsi/icann-raa-04nov99.htm">Registrar
Accreditation Agreement</A>, which is now in effect for all accredited
registrars. For further details, see <A HREF="../registrars/accreditation.htm">ICANN's
registrar accreditation pages</A>.</FONT></P>
