      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">These new 14 bring the total number of
      companies that have met the criteria for accreditation to 124.
      The new registrars will become part of the Shared Registration
      System (&quot;SRS&quot;), the domain name registration system
      for competitive registrars in the .com, .net, and .org top-level
      domains. Stability of the Internet and continuity for consumers
      are protected by the requirement that every business desiring
      to become a registrar in top-level domains must first become
      accredited by ICANN. Under the SRS competing ICANN-accredited
      registrars register domain names utilizing one shared, central
      registry operated and maintained by Network Solutions, Inc.</FONT></P>

      on Proposed ICANN 2000-2001 Budget</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN is in the process of formulating
      its budget for the 2000-2001 fiscal year. A draft budget developed
      through a consultative process with members of ICANN constituencies
      was posted on the ICANN web site on March 6 and discussed at
      the ICANN public meeting in Cairo on March 9. After revisions
      were made through additional consultation with members of the
      ICANN community, the proposed budget was discussed by the ICANN
      Board at its monthly meeting on May 4 and approved for posting
      for public comment.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Board invites comments on the revised
      budget and has established a Public Comment Forum for that purpose.
      Comments should be made by June 1, 2000, so that they reach the
      Board in time for its consideration of adopting a budget at its
      June 2000 meeting.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">To review the proposed budget and enter
      the public comment forum, see <A HREF="../financials/proposed-budget-04may00.htm">http://www.icann.org/financials/proposed-budget-04may00.htm</A>.</FONT></P>
