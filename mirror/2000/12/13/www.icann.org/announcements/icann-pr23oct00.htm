      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">On Monday, 2 October 2000 the application
      period for those seeking to sponsor or operate new TLDs ended.
      A total of <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/tlds/tld-applications-lodged-02oct00.htm">47
      applications were received</A> during the application period.
      Fourty-four of these applications are still active.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Tasks That Have Been Completed</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN has completed the following steps
      in its review of applications:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Acknowledging receipt of applications.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Reviewing the applications to ensure they
        include all the required parts. All applications being considered
        now have all the required major parts, although some still appear
        to be missing exhibits, postable HTML versions, etc.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Verifying payment of the application fee.
        Two of the 47 applications submitted were not accompanied by
        the US $50,000 application fee. These two applications (.number/.tel/.phone
        and .wap) have been returned.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Reviewing confidentiality requests and
        contacting applicants to notify them of the disposition of the
        request. One of the 47 applications (.nyc) was withdrawn because
        the applicant and ICANN did not agree on treatment of confidentiality
        claims. All other confidentiality claims have been resolved by
        agreement. In general, ICANN agreed to treat only a very limited
        portion of application materials as confidential.</FONT>
      </UL>

      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Tasks Currently Underway</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN is currently involved in the following
      aspects of the review:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Where an application seeks alternative
        or multiple TLD strings, <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/tlds/new-tld-application-instructions-15aug00.htm#VIII">verifying
        that it is a single application</A> (i.e. that all parts of the
        application apply, without significant variation, to all of the
        strings). Applicants submitting materials that constitute more
        than one application will be notified in the near future.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Completing posting of non-confidential
        portions of <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/tlds/index.html">applications
        on the ICANN web site</A>.</FONT><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">
        </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">We have now posted nearly all of
        the applications materials, and expect to complete the process
        in the next few days. Confidentiality claims on a few applications
        have just been resolved. This has resulted in the applicants
        withdrawing portions of their applications that they consider
        confidential but that ICANN has not agreed to treat confidentially.
        We are working with these applicants to obtain electronic versions
        of the non-confidential portions of their applications for posting.
        For several other applications, the electronic versions of some
        subsidiary files were either not provided or were provided in
        unusable form. We are correcting these problems as they are identified.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Technical, business/financial, and legal
        review of applications.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The <A HREF="/mbx/tldapps/">web-based
        public comment forum</A> is currently collecting public comments
        on the applications. In ten days of operation, over 2000 comments
        have been submitted.</FONT>

      <P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Adjustments and Elaborations to the
      Schedule</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Based on progress of the process so far,
      here are a few adjustments and elaboration to the schedule:</FONT></P>

        <LI><B><U><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">Extension of First
        Public Comment Period</FONT></U><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">.</FONT></B><FONT
         FACE="Arial"> We originally scheduled the web-based public comment
        forum on the application materials to go out of operation on
        27 October. Because of the substantial interest in the public
        comment forum, and the unanticipated delays in completing the
        posting of all application materials, the forum will continue
        to be open for comments until 4:00 pm California time (midnight
        UTC) on Sunday, 5 November 2000.</FONT>
        <LI><B><U><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">Consultation Mechanism</FONT></U><FONT
         COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
        In the schedule, we set aside 18-21 October for possible in-person
        or videoconferenced interviews with applicants and other persons
        in connection with applications. We have found that the applications
        that have been submitted do a generally good job of explaining
        the nature of the proposals, and therefore have concluded that
        real-time interviews are not warranted at this time. We intend
        to gather the additional information we require by posing specific
        questions to applicants in e-mail and requesting a written response.
        The questions and responses will be posted on the web site, except
        for communications of a strictly clerical nature. We believe
        this mechanism offers an even greater degree of transparency
        than the interview mechanism that was originally scheduled.</FONT>

         COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
        The results of the staff review of the applications will be posted
        on approximately 8 November 2000. We expect these results to
        be presented in a detailed report, including an explanation of
        the goals of the analysis, a detailed statement of how the analysis
        was performed, identification of those who participated in the
        review process, summaries of findings as to each application,
        compilations of comparative data on the applications, observations
        regarding how the posted criteria for evaluation apply, and other
        relevant results of the analysis.</FONT>

         FACE="Arial">A second web-based public comment forum will be
        established at the time the Staff Report is issued to allow the
        public to comment on the report. The second forum will also permit
        persons wishing to make their own comments on the applications
        to do so.</FONT>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Recently ICANN has received correspondence
      from various parties asserting that establishment of particular
      TLDs would infringe their claimed intellectual property rights.
      To promote the openness and transparency of the selection process,
      this correspondence and ICANN's responses have been <A HREF="/tlds/correspondence/">posted</A>
      for consideration of the community.</FONT></P>
