REGISTRARS</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=+0>(WASHINGTON - April 21, 1999) The Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) today announced the five companies
that have been selected to participate in the initial testbed phase of
the new competitive Shared Registry System for the .com, .net, and .org
domains. These five participants will be the first to implement the new
system for competition in the market for .com, .net, and .org domain name
registration services. Currently, registration services in the .com, .net,
and .org domains are provided by Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI), which has
enjoyed an exclusive right to handle registrations under a 1993 Cooperative
Agreement with the U.S. Government.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The five registrars participating in the testbed are,
in alphabetical order:</FONT>
<DIR>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>America Online</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>CORE (Internet Council of Registrars)</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>France Telecom/Ol&eacute;ane</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>Melbourne IT</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>register.com</FONT></LI>
</DIR>
<FONT SIZE=+0>Under the Cooperative Agreement between NSI and the U.S.
Government, the competitive registrar testbed program will begin on April
26 and will last until June 24, 1999 (Phase I). Following the conclusion
of Phase I, the Shared Registry System for the .com, .net, and .org domains
will be opened on equal terms to all accredited registrars, meaning that
any company that meets ICANN's standards for accreditation will be able
to enter the market as a registrar and offer customers competitive domain
name registration services in the .com, .net, and .org domains.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>"Today's announcement marks a major milestone in the joint
efforts of the public and private sectors to bring Internet users the benefits
of real competition in registration services in the most popular Internet
domains -- .com, .net, and .org," said Esther Dyson, ICANN's interim chairman.
"The five testbed participants bring a wealth of technical capability,
business experience, and geographic reach to the testbed program, and each
has demonstrated a strong commitment to make this effort succeed on behalf
of the global Internet community."</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In addition to the five testbed participants, ICANN also
announced today that <A HREF="posttestebed.html">29 other applicant companies</A>
have met its accreditation criteria and are expected to be accredited to
compete as registrars upon completion of the testbed phase. Those companies
include the following: 9NetAvenue; A Technology Company; Active ISP; Alldomains.com;
All West Communications; American Domain Name Registry; AT&amp;T; Domain
Direct; DomainRegistry.com; eNom, Inc.; InfoAvenue; InfoNetworks; InfoRamp;
Interactive Telecom Network; Interdomain; Internet Domain Registrars; interQ
Incorporated; MS Intergate; NameSecure.com; Name.Space Inc.; NetBenefit;
NetNames; Nominalia; Port Information System AB; RCN; Telepartner AS; Verio;
Virtual Internet; and WebTrends.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>"As the list of post-testbed registrars makes clear, there
is a tremendous level of commercial interest in opening the market for
domain name services to competition," said Mike Roberts, ICANN's interim
president and CEO. "These companies are ready, willing, and able to compete.
ICANN is committed to working with the United States Government, the testbed
participants, and all post-testbed registrars to launch this program successfully."</FONT>

<CENTER><B>COMMENTS FROM TESTBED PARTICIPANTS</B></CENTER>
&nbsp;

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>George Vradenburg, Senior Vice President for Global
and Strategic Policy, America Online:</FONT></I>

<P><I>"Today's announcement is an important step in the Internet's evolution.
Movement to an open, competitive model in domain names is, in fact, a natural
step for a medium that has thrived because of its openness. America Online
looks forward to participating in the testbed phase of the transition to
a competitive system."</I>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I>Ken Stubbs, Chair of the Executive Committee, CORE:</I>

<P><I>"We at CORE are very pleased to see a major step in the transition
process being taken here and are honored to be chosen as one of the key
organizations selected to play a significant role in effecting the movement
towards more open global participation and competition in the domain name
registration process. This is the first of many important changes which
we feel will ultimately result in a more competitive and open process for
management of the expansion of the domain name system. CORE commends ICANN
and the participating parties for their hard work and commitment to the
spirit of the "white paper" process and looks forward to the opportunity
to play an increasing role in the global transition of the Internet into
the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century."</I>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I>Jean-Jacques Damlamian, Group Executive Vice-President, Development
Division, France Telecom:</I>

<P><I>"France Telecom has played an active role in the worldwide consensus-building
effort that led to the creation of ICANN. Today, France Telecom is very
proud to be selected by ICANN as one of the testbed registrars. It will
contribute to strengthening our position as a leading Internet company,
by acknowledging our capacity to be a partner of the Internet development
at the international level. Moreover, our subsidiary Ol&eacute;ane, which
was a pioneer of the Internet in France, is once more at the forefront
of the Internet evolution, by taking part in this strategic project for
the future of the network."</I>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I>Peter Gerrand, CEO of Melbourne IT:</I>

<P><I>"As the largest registrar in the Asia-Pacific region, Melbourne IT
is excited to expand its operations in the global domain name registration
business. We are committed to working with the other four testbed registrars
in this historic opening of the .com, .net, and .org registries to competition,
which will result in lower costs, better service, and more choices for
customers. In particular, we look forward to offering a high standard of
service to the diverse and booming Internet market throughout the Asia-Pacific
region."</I>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I>Richard Forman, CEO and President of register.com:</I>

<P><I>"We are very pleased to have been selected by ICANN to be one of
the five test-bed registrars. We would like to thank the members of ICANN
and the Department of Commerce for this vote of confidence. We would also
like to thank all register.com employees, for turning our company's vision
into a reality, and our hundreds of thousands of customers who have made
register.com's service the most popular registrar on the Internet. Moving
forward, register.com is looking forward to a healthy and cooperative relationship
with Network Solutions in re-defining this industry. Our mutual efforts
will create a larger, more diverse market, thereby benefiting all accredited
registrars and customers alike. Register.com welcomes this next stage in
the further development of the Internet industry."</I>

<BR><B>ABOUT ICANN</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
(ICANN) is a new global non-profit corporation formed to oversee a set
of the Internet's core technical management functions. Between now and
September 2000, ICANN will gradually be assuming responsibility for coordinating
the assignment of protocol parameters, the management of the domain name
system and root server systems, and the allocation of IP address space.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In the past, many of these functions have been handled
by the U.S. Government or by its contractors and volunteers. This informal
structure represented the spirit and culture of the research community
in which the Internet developed. However, the growing size and international
importance of the Internet has necessitated the creation of a technical
management body that is both more formalized in structure and more fully
reflective of the geographic diversity of the Internet community.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>ICANN is a non-profit corporation with a ten-member international
Board of Directors. Its Initial Board is led by interim chairman Esther
Dyson, and has members drawn from Europe, North America, and the Asia/Pacific
region. This initial board has been charged with finalizing ICANN's bylaws
and procedures and working to pave the way for a smooth and stable transition
from the present administrative system. The initial board members will
ultimately be replaced by board members elected by three different constituency
groups based on technical subjects and an at-large membership, collectively
representing a broad cross-section of the Internet's technical and user
communities around the globe.</FONT>
