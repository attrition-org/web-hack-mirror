        <P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial">ICANN Releases Report
        of Independent Auditors</FONT></B></CENTER></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(10 November 2000) Marina del Rey, CA.
      ICANN today released the report of its independent auditors,
      KPMG, LLP, on its financial statements for the fiscal year ending
      June 30, 2000.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Commenting on the report and statements,
      ICANN Director Linda Wilson, Chair of the Board's Audit Committee,
      said, &quot;The successful completion of its first fully audited
      fiscal year is an important milestone for ICANN on the path to
      a stable and predictable base of financial support. The recent
      granting of tax exempt status by the United States Internal Revenue
      Service and the receipt of a favorable audit opinion from KPMG
      demonstrate the rapid progress being made toward a sound fiscal
      condition.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;However, there are challenges still
      to be dealt with. First, there is a million dollars of debt in
      the form of short term loans on our balance sheet that must be
      repaid within the next twelve months. Second, the auditors have
      qualified their opinion with respect to the amounts due to ICANN
      from the country code Top Level Domain organizations, which totaled
      $1.36 million on June 30, 2000. The other members of the Board
      and I look forward to a mutually satisfactory adoption of registry
      agreements with country code Top Level Domain organizations to
      avoid this problem in future years.&quot;</FONT></P>

      statements are available at &lt;<A HREF="/financials/financial-report-fye-30jun00.htm">http://www.icann.org/financials/financial-report-fye-30jun00.htm</A>&gt;.</FONT></P>
