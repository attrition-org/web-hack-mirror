        Names Invited</FONT></CENTER></H2>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">For the last nine months, Working Groups
        B (famous names) and C (new gTLDs) of the ICANN Domain Name Supporting
        Organization (DNSO) have been discussing various aspects of their
        assigned topics. On 21 March 2000, these two working groups submitted
        reports on their progress, which were then posted on the &lt;<A
        HREF="http://www.dnso.org/">www.dnso.org</A>&gt; web site.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The DNSO Names Council invites the Internet
        community to comment on these reports and the issues raised by
        them. Both reports have now been posted on the ICANN web site
        (they are also still available on the DNSO web site), where a
        web-based public comment forum has been established for each
        report. To read the reports and comment on them, go to &lt;<A
        HREF="http://www.icann.org/dnso/new-gtlds-01apr00.htm">http://www.icann.org/dnso/new-gtlds-01apr00.htm</A>&gt;.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The ICANN Board has requested the Names
        Council to provide its recommendations on these topics by 20
        April 2000. The Names Council will consider the reports and comments
        submitted on them at its 18 April 2000 meeting. Members of the
        Internet community are encouraged to submit their comments as
        far as possible in advance of the 18 April meeting.</FONT></P>

        Proceedings</FONT></CENTER></H2>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Over 400 proceedings have been commenced
        under the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy since
        the policy went into full operation on 3 January 2000. In an
        effort to assist the community in keeping track of these proceedings,
        the ICANN web site lists the proceedings arranged by (a) commencement
        date, (b) proceeding number, and (c) domain name. In addition,
        the ICANN site now offers a search tool and a statistical report
        on the status of the proceedings. These may be accessed through
        &lt;<A HREF="../udrp/udrp.htm#InformationonProceedings">http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp.htm#InformationonProceedings</A>&gt;.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
