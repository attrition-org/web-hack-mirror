  <p><font face="Arial">The ICANN Bylaws call for the establishment of a procedure 
    by which the actions of the ICANN Board can be subjected to independent third-party 
    review:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial">(b) The Initial Board shall, following solicitation 
      of input from the Advisory Committee on Independent Review and other interested 
      parties and consideration of all such suggestions, adopt policies and procedures 
      for independent third-party review of Board actions alleged by an affected 
      party to have violated the Corporation's articles of incorporation or bylaws.

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">In March 1999, the ICANN Board appointed a 10-member <a href="../irac.html">Advisory 
    Committee on Independent Review</a>. The Committee posted for public review 
    and comment an <a href="http://www.icann.org/irac-interim-report.html">Interim 
    Report</a> with draft principles for independent review on 7 May 1999, along 
    with an <a href="http://www.icann.org/irac-addendum.html">addendum</a> on 
    26 May. Those documents were the subject of public discussion at the ICANN 
    meetings in Berlin, 26-27 May 1999. The Board <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-27may99.htm#iracrecommendations">accepted</a> 
    the draft principles and directed the committee to complete its work in time 
    for consideration at the next round of meetings in Santiago.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The Committee's <a href="http://www.icann.org/santiago/irac-final-report.htm">Final 
    Report: Principles for Independent Review</a> was posted on 6 August 1999, 
    and was the subject of public discussion at the ICANN meetings in Santiago, 
    25-26 August 1999. The Board <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-26aug99.htm#independentreview">accepted</a> 
    the principles and directed the ICANN staff to prepare a written policy implementing 
    those principles for consideration at the Board's next round of meetings in 
    Los Angeles.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Following the Board's Santiago meetings, ICANN concluded 
    a set of tentative agreements with Network Solutions, Inc., and the U.S. Department 
    of Commerce. Those agreements included provisions relating to ICANN's independent 
    review structure. [See, for example, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/nsi/nsi-registry-agreement-04nov99.htm">ICANN-NSI 
    Registry Agreement</a>, Definition 1.] Accordingly, the posting of a final 
    policy for independent review was delayed until the next round of ICANN meetings, 
    after the Board had determined whether or not to approve the proposed ICANN-NSI-DoC 
    agreements.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Prior to the <a href="../cairo2000/cairo-details.htm">March 
    2000 Cairo meetings</a>, the ICANN staff posted a <a href="http://www.icann.org/cairo2000/indreview-topic.htm">Proposed 
    Independent Review Policy</a> for public review and comment. The ICANN Board 
    adopted the proposed policy with a few minor amendments.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial"><b> Independent Review Policy</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial">On 10 March, 2000, the ICANN Board approved the <a href="http://www.icann.org/indreview/policy.htm">Independent 
    Review Policy</a>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Implementation Status</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial">The first step in the implementation of the Independent 
    Review Policy is the creation of the IRP Nominating Committee, which will 
    in turn nominate the 9 members of the Independent Review Panel. The IRP Nominating 
    Committee will consist of six members, two chosen by each of ICANN's three 
    Supporting Organization Councils.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Once the Supporting Organization Councils have named the 
    members of the IRP Nominating Committee, it will have 45 days in which to 
    select a slate of 9 nominees for the Independent Review Panel.</font></p>
