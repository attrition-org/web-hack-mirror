  <p><font face="Arial">Later this year, five Directors of the Internet Corporation 
    for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) will be selected by ICANN's At Large 
    Members in a worldwide online election. As the first step of the election 
    process, ICANN has chartered a <a href="index.html">Nominating 
    Committee</a> to nominate a set of candidates for the consideration of the 
    <a href="http://members.icann.org">At Large Members</a>. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The ICANN <a href="index.html">Nominating 
    Committee</a> actively seeks recommendations and/or expressions of interest 
    from members of the Internet community. To identify outstanding candidates, 
    the Committee depends upon input from Internet users worldwide. Communications 
    sent to the Nominating Committee will be kept confidential. To be most useful, 
    recommendations and expressions of interest should contain the information 
    in the Guidelines set forth below, and should be sent to &lt;<a href="mailto:nominations@icann.org">nominations@icann.org</a>&gt;. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">For more information on the duties and responsibilities of At Large
          Directors <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/nomcom/candidate-information-07jul00.htm">
          click here</A>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Recommendations and expressions of interest should be 
    sent no later than July 10, 2000. The Nominating Committee intends to complete 
    its work by the end of July, after which the election process will proceed 
    to:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">a <b>self-nomination phase</b>, in which candidates 
      who were not nominated by the Nominating Committee can seek a place on the 
      ballot by attracting a minimum threshold of support from At Large Members 
      in her/his region (as defined by ICANN) via online petition; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">a <b>campaign period</b>; and </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial"> the <b>vote</b> of the At Large Members. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Arial">Nomination by the Nominating Committee will thus be one 
    of two avenues for candidates to appear on the final ballot. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">For more on the Nominating Committee, its members, and 
    the At Large election process, see <a href="index.html">the 
    Committee's homepage</a>. To review the ICANN staff's proposed rules for the
