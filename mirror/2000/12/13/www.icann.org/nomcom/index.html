        <p><font face="Arial">ICANN's <a href="http://members.icann.org/">At Large 
          Membership</a> election process for 2000 is currently underway. Through 
          these worldwide online elections, ICANN's At Large Members will choose 
          five Directors for the ICANN Board, one from each of five geographic 
          regions (Africa, Asia/Australia/Pacific, Europe, Latin America/Caribbean, 
          and North America).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">As part of that process, ICANN chartered a Nominating 
          Committee to select a set of candidates to be put before the At Large 
          Members for their consideration. The Nominating Committee's objective 
          was to identify outstanding candidates that will be widely supported 
          throughout the Internet community.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The Nominating Committee's nominations were completed 
          on 31 July 2000, and are listed in the <a href="#nominations">Committee's 
          report</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">To keep its operations open and transparent, the 
          Committee posted its <a href="#criteria">selection criteria</a> in connection 
          with its <a href="#call">Call for Recommendations and Expressions of 
          Interest</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Now that its work has been completed, the election 
          process will proceed to (1) a member-nomination phase in which candidates 
          who were not nominated by the Nominating Committee can seek a place 
          on the ballot by attracting a minimum threshold of support from At Large 
          Members in her/his region via online endorsement; (2) a voter-education 
          period; and, finally, (3) the vote of the At Large Members. Nomination 
          by the Nominating Committee is thus one of two avenues for candidates 
          to appear on the final ballot. See the <a href="http://members.icann.org">At 
          Large Membership home page</a> for details.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial">We express our appreciation for the willingness 
          of these individuals to consider the possibility of serving as a member 
          of the Board, and for the active participation of those who recommended 
          candidates for consideration by the Nominating Committee. We also gratefully 
          recognize the helpful commentary from the community during the design 
          of this election process as well as the widespread interest in ICANN's 
          technical and administrative responsibility for coordinating the Internet's 
          domain name and IP address systems. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Approximately 211 individuals expressed interest 
          in being considered, or were recommended for consideration. The committee 
          received input from over 400 individuals worldwide. Multiple names were 
          forwarded to the Nominating Committee from each of ICANN's five geographic 
          regions. </font></p>
