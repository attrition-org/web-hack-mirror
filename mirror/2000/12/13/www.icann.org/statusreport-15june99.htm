<P align="center"><b>STATUS REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE</b></P>
<P align="center"><b>JUNE 15,1999</b></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P> On November 25, 1998, the United States Department of Commerce ("DOC") officially 
  recognized the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") 
  as the global, non-profit consensus organization designed to carry on various 
  administrative functions for the Internet name and address system that it had 
  called upon the Internet community to create in its <a href="general/white-paper-05jun98.htm">White 
  Paper</a> issued in June, 1998. Approximately six months have now passed since 
  the signing of the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/icann-memorandum.htm">Memorandum 
  of Understanding</a> between DOC and ICANN; this document constitutes a status 
  report on both progress made and issues remaining to be solved.</P>
<B> 
<P>I. STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING PROGRESS. </P>
</B>
<P>The process of establishing ICANN has understandably been a difficult and contentious 
  one from the beginning. The creation of a worldwide, non-profit, private consensus 
  organization to manage various aspects of a global resource is a unique undertaking; 
  there are no models for such a non-governmental entity with similar responsibilities. 
  We have sought consensus from a necessarily diverse set of actors, ranging from 
  academics to businesses to infrastructure providers to engineers; consensus 
  is frequently elusive even in more homogeneous groups. There were inevitably 
  many different views about how to accomplish the goal, not to mention a variety 
  of opinions as to whether the goal was desirable at all.</P>
<P>In this environment, it is hardly surprising that there remains today a diversity 
  of views on what has been done, what should be done, and how things could be 
  done. It is also almost certainly true that there is no single right way to 
  move toward the stated goal; there are likely to be several paths that could 
  be followed to an acceptable outcome. On the other hand, there is a set of standards 
  and criteria against which the work of the last six months can reasonably be 
  measured: the standards and criteria set forth by the US Government in the White 
  Paper.</P>
<P>While the White Paper may not be the equivalent of the Magna Carta, it did 
  set forth a series of guiding principles (subsequently adopted essentially verbatim 
  in the MOU) that seemed at the time to have wide-spread support within the Internet 
  community from both private and public commenters. The core principles articulated 
  in the White Paper were as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <BLOCKQUOTE> 
    <P>1.&#9;Stability: "During the transition and thereafter, the stability of 
      the Internet should be the first priority of any DNS management system."</P>
    <P>2.&#9;Competition: "Where possible, market mechanisms that support competition 
      and consumer choice should drive the management of the Internet because 
      they will lower costs, promote innovation, encourage diversity, and enhance 
      user choice and satisfaction."</P>
    <P>3. &#9;Private Sector, Bottom-Up Coordination: "A private coordinating 
      process is likely to be more flexible than government and to move rapidly 
      enough to meet the changing needs of the Internet and of Internet users. 
      The private process should, as far as possible, reflect the bottom-up governance 
      that has characterized development of the Internet to date."</P>
    <P>4.&#9;Representation: "Management structures should reflect the functional 
      and geographic diversity of the Internet and its users. Mechanisms should 
      be established to ensure international participation in decision making."</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These principles formed the basis of the MOU, and have dictated ICANN's policy 
  decisions to date. They are the standards which the ICANN Initial Board has 
  used to guide its policy development efforts, and against which the results 
  of those efforts should be measured. </P>
<P>In addition to these core principles, the White Paper went on to discuss:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <BLOCKQUOTE> 
    <P><B>funding: </b>the White Paper assumed that the new corporation would 
      be funded by "domain name registries, regional IP registries, or other entities 
      identified by the Board;"</P>
    <P><B>staff: </b>the White Paper assumed that the new corporation would absorb 
      the IANA staff that had been carrying out many of these functions pursuant 
      to government contracts;</P>
    <P><B>incorporation: </b>the White Paper assumed that the new entity would 
      be incorporated in the United States, but have a Board made up of members 
      from around the world;</P>
    <P><B>governance: </b>the White Paper called for a "sound and transparent 
      decision-making process;" and </P>
    <P> <B>operations: </b>the White Paper stated that processes should be "fair, 
      open and pro-competitive." </P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, the White Paper suggested a <B>structure</B> that was "balanced 
  to equitably represent the interests of IP number registries, domain name registries, 
  domain name registrars, the technical community, Internet service providers 
  (ISPs), and Internet users (commercial, not-for-profit, and individuals) from 
  around the world." The White Paper went on to declare that the new corporation 
  should take the following early actions:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <BLOCKQUOTE> 
    <P>1. &#9;"appoint, on an interim basis, an initial Board of Directors," which 
      would serve "until the Board of Directors is elected and installed."</P>
    <P>2.&#9;"establish a system for electing a Board of Directors . . . that 
      insures that the new corporation's Board of Directors reflects the geographical 
      and functional diversity of the Internet, and is sufficiently flexible to 
      permit evolution to reflect changes in the constituency of Internet stakeholders," 
      while preserving, "as much as possible, the tradition of bottom-up governance;" 
      Directors "should be elected from membership or other associations open 
      to all or through other mechanisms that ensure broad representation and 
      participation in the election process."</P>
    <P>3.&#9;"develop policies for the addition of TLDs, and establish the qualifications 
      for domain name registries and domain name registrars within the system."</P>
    <P>4.&#9;"restrict official government representation on the Board of Directors 
      without precluding governments and intergovernmental organizations from 
      participating as Internet users or in a non-voting advisory capacity."</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The White Paper also set forth views on <B>intellectual property</B> issues, 
  including that (1) all interested parties "should have access to searchable 
  databases of registered domain names; (2) domain name registrants should be 
  required to "pay registration fees at the time of registration or renewal;" 
  (3) domain name registrants would agree to "submit to and be bound by alternative 
  dispute resolution systems;" and (4) the new corporation would protect "certain 
  famous trademarks from being used as domain names . . . except by the designated 
  trademark holder." </P>
<P>Finally, the White Paper stated that the United States Government would itself 
  take certain steps to "accomplish the objectives" set forth in the White Paper. 
  These were identified as the following:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <BLOCKQUOTE> 
    <P>1.&#9;"ramp down the cooperative agreement with NSI with the objective 
      of introducing competition into the domain name space."</P>
    <P>2.&#9;"enter into agreement[s] with the new corporation under which it 
      assumes responsibility for management of the domain name space."</P>
    <P>3.&#9;ask WIPO to "convene an international process . . . to develop a 
      set of recommendations for trademark/domain name dispute resolutions and 
      other issues to be presented to the Interim Board for its consideration 
      as soon as possible." </P>
    <P>4.&#9;"consult with the international community, including other interested 
      governments."</P>
    <P>5. &#9;"undertake . . . a review of the root server system to recommend 
      means to increase the security and professional management of the system."</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>While the transition process is still young, periodic evaluations of progress 
  are desirable checks on both the direction and pace of the transition. This 
  report attempts to provide such an evaluation.</P>

<B> 
<P>III. POINT-BY-POINT COMPARISON TO WHITE PAPER.</P>
</B> 
<P>The <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">White 
  Paper</a> identified four overarching principles that should guide the formation 
  and decisions of ICANN: stability, competition, private-sector bottom-up coordination, 
  and functional and geographic representation: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <BLOCKQUOTE> 
    <P>1.&#9;<B>Stability.</B> The DNS has remained fully operational, notwithstanding 
      increasing demand for domain-name services and the introduction of competition 
      in the registration of names in the .com, .net and .org TLDs (as described 
      below). This issue -- operational stability -- requires constant attention, 
      especially given the less than enthusiastic cooperation that ICANN and the 
      DOC have received from Network Solutions, Inc., the historical monopoly 
      registry and registrar in these domains. There remain important steps to 
      be taken in the transition process, including the introduction of fully 
      competitive name registration services, the full separation of NSI's registry 
      and registration services, and the ultimate transfer of root server administration/control 
      to ICANN. ICANN and DOC will carefully manage these events with this primary 
      objective in mind.</P>
    <P>2. &#9;<B>Competition. </B>With the accreditation of five testbed registrars, 
      and the beginning of competitive domain-name registration services by those 
      registrars, the transition from monopoly to competition has begun. As has 
      been true in every other transition from monopoly to competition, there 
      have already been difficulties, and there will undoubtedly be others. In 
      such situations, the incumbent monopolist has no particular incentive to 
      do anything more, or quicker, than is absolutely required to expedite this 
      transition, and our experience to date is that this situation will not prove 
      to be an exception. Nevertheless, one of the testbed registrars is now operating 
      and selling domain name services in competition with NSI; the other four 
      testbed registrars are expected to begin competitive operations within the 
      next two weeks; 37 other entities have been conditionally accredited to 
      begin operating when the testbed phase is completed; and ICANN and DOC are 
      continuing to seek appropriate cooperation from NSI to facilitate the transition 
      to full and open competition.</P>
    <P>3.&#9;<B>Private-Sector Bottom-Up Coordination.</B> The Initial Board has 
      encouraged the self-organization of its constituent units through bottom-up 
      efforts, rather than dictation of the organization, structure and membership 
      from the top. This has predictably resulted in a somewhat chaotic process, 
      and taken some time; bottom-up process has much to recommend it, but those 
      benefits do not include efficiency and speed. Nevertheless, we have seen 
      great progress: the <a href="http://www.dnso.org/">Domain Name Supporting 
      Organization</a> is essentially formed, and has begun to function in its 
      advisory role to the ICANN Board by taking under consideration various <a href="http://www.icann.org/wipo/wipo_report.htm">recommendations 
      made to ICANN by WIPO</a>, and referred by the ICANN Board to the DNSO for 
      its recommendations. In addition, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/pso/psonew.htm">Protocol 
      Supporting Organization</a> proposal was approved by the ICANN Board in 
      its recent Berlin meeting, and we hope that this entity can be officially 
      recognized soon. The final part of this puzzle, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/aso/asonew.htm">Address 
      Supporting Organization</a>, is scheduled to submit a proposal to the ICANN 
      Board for its review at its next meeting in <a href="http://www.icann.org/santiago/santiago-details.html">Santiago</a> 
      in August.</P>
    <P>4.&#9;<B>Representation. </B>With the three Supporting Organizations listed 
      just above responsible for electing three members each to ICANN's 19-member 
      Board, the functional diversity objective of the White Paper will be substantially 
      met once those entities are formed and have provided Directors to the Board. 
      ICANN will also require that those Directors be geographically diverse, 
      as is true to a significant extent today with the Initial Board (which includes 
      residents of three of the five ICANN-defined geographic regions). The more 
      difficult effort, described in some detail below, is the design of the process 
      for electing the nine At Large Directors called for by the ICANN Bylaws, 
      but the process of defining an electorate and establishing Director election 
      procedures consistent with the White Paper principles is well underway.</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thus, the four guiding principles of the White Paper have in fact been realized 
  in ICANN's organizational and policy development process to date, as can be 
  seen in somewhat more detail by the following focus on specific issues addressed 
  in the White Paper </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <BLOCKQUOTE> 
    <P><B>Incorporation and Initial Board. </b>As suggested by the White Paper, 
      ICANN was incorporated in the United States in October, 1998. Its Initial 
      Board is broadly representative of the Internet community, with five Directors 
      (including the Interim CEO) from the United States, three from Europe, one 
      from Australia and one from Japan; their professional backgrounds include 
      educational computing, telecommunications, Internet technical/academic interests, 
      trade associations and Internet entrepreneurial activities.</P>
    <P><B>Funding. </b>The White Paper suggested that ICANN should be funded by 
      name or address registries, presumably by allocation of a portion of the 
      fee charged by those registries. Since ICANN is intended to be non-profit, 
      and therefore revenues may only recover its costs, over time those fees 
      will be adjusted to balance ICANN's specific funding needs, which are not 
      yet clear. In the interim, ICANN has proposed to fund its future operations 
      primarily from a fee of no greater than $1 annually per domain-name registration, 
      an approach suggested (without a specific amount) by the White Paper, with 
      the exact amount of that fee to be determined over time by ICANN's costs 
      and the revenue generated by a particular fee level. Since ICANN is not 
      yet fully functional, it has existed to date on private donations and credit, 
      with some recent small amount of funds received from those seeking accreditation 
      as registrars.</P>
    <P><B>Staffing. </b>As called for by the White Paper, most of the former IANA 
      staff are now managed and compensated by ICANN, and have continued to carry 
      out their technical and administrative responsibilities without interruption.</P>
    <P><B>Governance and Operations. </b>The White Paper called for an "open and 
      transparent" decision-making process. As a result, the ICANN bylaws require 
      a broad set of procedures to ensure that all points of view be considered 
      before any decisions are taken. These include extensive notice and comment 
      requirements before any decisions are made that "substantially affect the 
      operation of the Internet or third parties, including the imposition of 
      any fees or charges." </P>
    <P>In addition, the ICANN Board has made it a practice to hold a public meeting 
      immediately prior to our regular quarterly Board meetings, in which all 
      matters on the Board agenda are discussed with participants. While Board 
      meetings are not open to the public, to facilitate the candid and objective 
      decision-making so critical at this stage of ICANN's development, the Board 
      has adopted the practice of immediately publishing all Board decisions, 
      making the text of resolutions public as quickly as possible, and holding 
      a public press conference immediately following its meetings to explain 
      its decisions and take questions about them. </P>
    <P><B>Structure. </b>The ICANN structure follows almost exactly the prescription 
      of the White Paper. There is an Initial Board which will serve until a regularly 
      elected Board is installed, but in any event not beyond October 2000. Since 
      the latter will be composed of three persons elected by each of three Supporting 
      Organizations (a total of nine), nine persons elected by the At Large membership, 
      and the president of ICANN <I>ex officio</I>, the creation of the Supporting 
      Organizations and the At Large membership is a necessary condition for the 
      existence of a regularly elected Board. </P>
    <P>Taking care to follow the principle of bottom-up coordination, the Initial 
      Board has left to the communities involved the creation of the Supporting 
      Organizations. These groups have, not surprisingly, moved at different paces, 
      to the effect that the Domain Name SO is now close to full formation, and 
      is likely to elect its three Directors by the end of 1999, while the Protocol 
      SO and the Address SO are somewhat further from completion. Still, it does 
      seem possible that the nine SO Directors could all be in place relatively 
      early in 2000. The Initial Board's present intention is to simply add these 
      Directors as elected to the Initial Board.</P>
    <P>The nine At Large Directors scheduled to be elected by a membership present 
      a more complicated problem. Despite a significant amount of work by a diverse 
      <a href="membership-com.html">Membership Advisory Committee</a>, 
      we still have not identified the specific process by which a broadly representative 
      membership can be constituted, with due regard for the cultural and economic 
      differences within the global user community and the need to protect against 
      minority capture. The White Paper seemed to assume that Directors would 
      be elected "from membership or other associations;" as presently contemplated, 
      however, the nine At Large Directors are scheduled to be elected by individual 
      members. This deviation from the White Paper prescription presents a number 
      of serious practical and economic problems to be overcome before a process 
      consistent with the stability that the White Paper described as the "first 
      priority" of the transition can be established.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the <a href="membership-com.html">Membership 
      Advisory Committee</a> has recommended a set of policies to the Board, and 
      the Board has directed staff and legal counsel to recommend before the <a href="http://www.icann.org/santiago/santiago-details.html">Santiago 
      meeting</a> how those policies could be implemented. The fact that it is 
      a very difficult problem to solve consistent with the White Paper principles 
      does not mean that it is not necessary to solve this challenge; there must 
      be a way for the users of the Internet, who will undoubtedly be affected 
      by the policy decisions of ICANN, to have a role in influencing those policy 
      decisions, and the Initial Board is committed to making that happen.</P>
    <P><B>New TLDs. </b>The White Paper assumed that the Initial Board would both 
      address the possibility of a need for new TLDs, and establish a system of 
      qualifications for DNS registries and registrars in current and any new 
      TLDs. WIPO has now, pursuant to the invitation in the White Paper, made 
      a series of <a href="http://www.icann.org/wipo/wipo.htm">recommendations</a> 
      relating to new TLDs, dispute resolution and related issues. We have referred 
      those recommendations to the newly-established DNSO for its review and recommendations 
      to the ICANN Board.</P>
    <P>ICANN has developed a set of <a href="http://www.icann.org/registrars/accreditation.html">guidelines 
      for the accreditation of registrars</a> in the .com, .net and .org domains, 
      and has accredited five registrars (the testbed registrars) and provisionally 
      accredited 37 others who will begin operations following the completion 
      of the testbed. It is developing guidelines for the accreditation of registries, 
      and has begun discussions with both registry administrators and its <a href="http://www.noie.gov.au/docs/gac1.htm">Government 
      Advisory Committee</a> about the appropriateness of, and standards for, 
      contractual relationships with registries and registrars for country code 
      TLDs.</P>
    <P><B>Relations with Governments. </b>In order to meet the White Paper objective 
      of facilitating input from national governments and international organizations 
      while remaining a private, non-governmental organization, ICANN created 
      the <a href="http://www.noie.gov.au/docs/gac1.htm">Government Advisory Committee</a>. 
      The GAC now comprises representatives of 33 national governments and international 
      organizations, and functions as a vehicle for advising the ICANN Board of 
      particular concerns of governmental entities relating to the domain name 
      system and IP addresses and protocols. Consistent with the White Paper prescription, 
      the GAC has no authority over ICANN or its policies; it exists to offer 
      advice and to serve as a conduit for the transmission of the interests and 
      concerns of governmental bodies to the ICANN Board and the public.</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Concerning each of these specific issues or proposals identified in the White 
  Paper, ICANN has acted consistently with the principles outlined in that document. 
  In particular, ICANN agrees with the White Paper's assertions that "the stability 
  of the Internet should be the first priority," that competition should "drive 
  the management of the Internet," that the private coordinating process should, 
  "as far as possible reflect . . . bottom-up governance," and that its structure 
  and processes should reflect the "functional and geographic diversity of the 
  Internet and its users." As the above description illustrates, the policies 
  ICANN has adopted to date universally reflect the implementation of those principles.</P>
<B> 
<P>IV. CURRENT CHALLENGES.</P>
</B> 
<P>There are a number of important issues that remain to be dealt with, including 
  the creation of a workable At Large membership structure, the resolution of 
  various issues relating to the relationship of intellectual property principles 
  and the DNS, and the policies that will guide the relationship of ICANN with 
  country code TLDs. Nonetheless, the most critical immediate challenge facing 
  ICANN and the DOC remains the creation of a fully competitive environment for 
  the registration of names in the global Top Level Domains -- in particular, 
  .com., .net, and .org. The transition from monopoly to competition in these 
  domains is necessary for the long-term success of the privatization approach 
  endorsed by the White Paper, and at the moment the critical uncertain element 
  is the cooperation of the current monopoly government contractor, Network Solutions, 
  Inc. ("NSI").</P>
<P>NSI occupies a central role in the DNS process. It is the registry operator 
  for the most important TLDs -- .com, .net and .org. It has until recently been 
  the monopoly registrar for those domains, and it still remains by far the dominant 
  registrar. It is responsible for the operation of the A root server, under the 
  direction of the DOC. And it is by far the most powerful entity in the DNS environment. 
  So long as NSI operates the .com registry, all new registrars must rely on NSI 
  -- their principal competitor -- for access to that registry. Thus, in a very 
  practical sense, NSI has a significant influence on the pace of progress toward 
  the competitive environment envisioned by the White Paper.</P>
<P>NSI's cooperation with ICANN and DOC to date has been limited. Its principal 
  responsibility under <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/docnsi100698.htm">Amendment 
  11</a> to its Cooperative Agreement with DOC was to create a Shared Registration 
  System interface for its registry so that competitive registrars could use the 
  registry on the same terms as the NSI registrar. The SRS was supposed to be 
  functional on April 26; in fact, the first competitive registrar was not able 
  to begin offering competitive registrations until June 2. The other four testbed 
  registrars are still trying to achieve workable interfaces. In addition, NSI's 
  demands for overly broad intellectual property protection and various other 
  restrictive license terms for the SRS have considerably slowed progress. The 
  result has been the likely delay of the end of the testbed period and of the 
  beginning of fully competitive registrations.</P>
<P>Perhaps even more importantly, at least for the short term, NSI has to date 
  refused to accept the community-consensus registrar accreditation policies adopted 
  by ICANN after public notice and comment, and has even asserted that it should 
  not have to comply with the same accreditation standards that apply to all other 
  registrars. Obviously, full and fair competition requires that all have the 
  same opportunities, and to the extent that there are consumer protection or 
  other requirements, that all meet them equally. Thus, it is critical to accomplishing 
  the White Paper objective of maximizing competition that (1) NSI's registry 
  and registrar functions be fully separated, so that NSI as a registrar does 
  not have any structural advantage over its registrar competitors; (2) NSI accept 
  community consensus policies relating to registrars, as reflected in ICANN's 
  accreditation standards; and (3) the relationship between NSI as registry and 
  all registrars does not allow NSI to impair or adversely affect the development 
  of competition because of its continuing monopoly position as registry operator. 
</P>
<P>Both DOC and ICANN have stated that only accredited registrars will be permitted 
  to carry out registration activities in the .com, .net and .org domains after 
  the completion of the testbed phase; combined with NSI's current position, this 
  obviously creates the potential for conflict between NSI and DOC/ICANN. In addition, 
  NSI is required by Amendment 11 to fully separate its registry functions from 
  its registrar functions, and to charge for its registry functions a fee that 
  covers its costs and a reasonable return on its investment but no more. The 
  amount of this fee obviously has competitive implications, especially if NSI 
  continues as a registrar, and the fact that NSI and DOC have not yet reached 
  an agreement on this key issue is also a basis for potential conflict.</P>
<P>Finally, as a general proposition, NSI has to date refused to accept the policy 
  authority of ICANN, although it continues to "participate" in the creation of 
  ICANN institutions and policies. It has funded and encouraged a variety of ICANN 
  critics, including some whose only common cause with NSI would appear to be 
  unhappiness with ICANN. In short, NSI has generally been an impediment, not 
  a help, in the transition from government controlled monopoly to a private competitive 
  DNS. While this is perhaps not surprising, if this approach continues, and depending 
  on how it continues, it could have adverse implications for the short-run stability 
  of the domain name system. Because of this possibility, ICANN and DOC are taking 
  prudent steps necessary to be able to implement the White Paper objectives with 
  or without the cooperation of NSI.</P>

<P>V. CONCLUSION.</P>
</B> 
<P>In summary, the first six months of ICANN's existence have been productive, 
  albeit somewhat frenetic. There is much to do, and a cacophony of voices with 
  a range of advice from "go slow" to "speed up," and everything in between. The 
  volunteers who make up the Initial Board have been dismayed by the amount of 
  work required, and tremendously impressed by the incredible willingness of people 
  from all over the world to work with us to try to make this great experiment 
  work. We have a difficult road in front of us, but our experience to date makes 
  us even more confident that the job will get done.</P>
