<P>Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:</P>
<P>I welcome the opportunity to appear here today to discuss the activities of 
  the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regarding the 
  relationship between Internet domain names and intellectual property rights.</P>
<P>ICANN is the non-profit, private sector corporation formed by a broad coalition 
  of the Internet’s business, technical, and academic communities in October 1998 
  in response to the invitation of the U.S. Government in its <a href="general/white-paper-05jun98.htm">Statement 
  of Policy on Management of Internet Names and Addresses</a>, 63 Fed. Reg. 31741 
  (June 10, 1998), usually known as the "White Paper." ICANN has been designated 
  by the Government to serve as the global consensus entity to which it is transferring 
  responsibility for coordinating the assignment of Internet protocol parameters, 
  the management of the domain-name system, the allocation of the IP address space, 
  and the management of the Internet root server system.</P>
<P>Recognizing the large number of witnesses appearing today, I will devote my 
  presentation to a concise report on the status of ICANN’s consideration and 
  treatment of intellectual property rights in connection with the domain-name 
  system. As noted above, the White Paper contemplated that ICANN would assume 
  responsibility for four Internet coordination functions. One of those functions 
  involves overseeing operation of the domain-name system.</P>
<P>As the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">White 
  Paper</a> recognized, the increasing commercial use of the Internet has given 
  rise to increasing conflicts between the domain-name system and intellectual 
  property. To help resolve this "trademark dilemma," the White Paper envisioned 
  that "the <a href="http://www.wipo.int/eng/main.htm">World Intellectual Property 
  Organization (WIPO)</a> would initiate a balanced and transparent process, which 
  includes trademark holders and members of the Internet community who are not 
  trademark holders," to recommend procedures for minimizing problems between 
  the trademark and domain-name systems. 63 Fed. Reg. at 31747. Accordingly, in 
  the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">White 
  Paper</a> the U.S. Government stated its intent to "[a]sk WIPO to convene an 
  international process including individuals from the private sector and government 
  to develop a set of recommendations for trademark/domain name dispute resolutions 
  and other issues to be presented to the Interim [ICANN] Board for its consideration 
  as soon as possible&nbsp;. . . ." 63 Fed. Reg. at 31751.</P>
<P>Following this request, in late 1998 and early 1999 WIPO conducted an extensive 
  process to gather comments from interested parties and, on April 30, 1999, WIPO 
  submitted its <a href="http://wipo2.wipo.int/process/eng/final_report.html">Final 
  Report</a> to the ICANN Board containing recommendations in the following areas:</P>
<ul type="circle">
  <LI>Domain-name registration practices to reduce conflicts with intellectual 
    property rights. (<a href="http://wipo2.wipo.int/process/eng/final/FinalReport_2.html#CH2">Chapter 
    2 of Final WIPO Report</a>.) Although the Final Report included a large number 
    of recommended registration practices, the most noteworthy relate to ensuring 
    that accurate contact information is available about domain names and to providing 
    that registrars receive prepayment before name registrations go active. 
  <LI>A procedure for administrative resolution of disputes over domain-name registrations. 
    As reflected in <a href="http://wipo2.wipo.int/process/eng/final/FinalReport_3.html#CH3">Chapter 
    3</a> of its Final Report, WIPO recommended that an administrative dispute-resolution 
    procedure be required only in cases arising from "abusive" domain-name registrations. 
  <LI>In <a href="http://wipo2.wipo.int/process/eng/final/FinalReport_4.html#CH4">Chapters 
    4 and 5</a>, the Final WIPO Report recommended that famous and well-known 
    marks be excluded from registration as domain names (other than by their owners) 
    and that new global top-level domains be introduced only at a controlled rate 
    after famous-mark exclusions are in effect.</LI>
</ul>
<P>ICANN began consideration of the WIPO Final Report at its quarterly meeting 
  on May 26-27, 1999. At that meeting, the ICANN Board responded to the WIPO Report 
  in the following manner:</P>
<ul type="circle">
  <LI>Nearly all of the WIPO recommendations on registration practices had already 
    been included in the ICANN registrar accreditation policy, which the Board 
    adopted in March 1999 in preparation for the April 26, 1999, onset of competition 
    in the business of registering names in the .com, .net, and .org domains. 
    In particular, the ICANN registrar accreditation policy requires that accurate 
    contact information be made publicly available on a real-time basis and that 
    registrations not be activated until the registrar receives a reasonable assurance 
    of payment, such as through use of a credit card. 
  <LI>With respect to dispute-resolution procedures, the ICANN Board endorsed 
    the WIPO-recommended principle that there should be a uniform dispute policy 
    for all registrars in the .com, .net, and .org domains. At its May meeting, 
    the ICANN Board also took action to institute the ICANN <a href="http://www.dnso.org">Domain 
    Name Supporting Organization (DNSO)</a>, which is responsible for evaluating 
    policies concerning domain names. The details of the appropriate uniform dispute-resolution 
    were referred to the DNSO, which was requested to propose a specific policy 
    in time for adoption by the Board at the next quarterly ICANN meeting, in 
    August 1999. 
  <LI>To avoid unnecessary conflicts pending adoption of a formal policy, the 
    ICANN Board passed a resolution calling on the testbed registrars, who are 
    in the process of entering the domain-name registrar business, to work together 
    to formulate a model dispute resolution policy for voluntary adoption. 
  <LI>The topics of famous-names exclusions and establishment of new top-level 
    domains appeared to engender more controversy in the Internet community. Accordingly, 
    the ICANN Board asked the DNSO to evaluate these aspects of the WIPO report 
    and develop recommendations on these topics once the DNSO completes work on 
    the dispute-resolution policy.</LI>
</ul>
<P>Since the quarterly ICANN meeting in May, the DNSO has been working diligently 
  on the dispute-resolution issues. A working group has issued a report, which 
  is being considered by the DNSO Names Council. Two of the other witnesses at 
  this hearing are members of the Names Council, and can provide you details on 
  those proceedings. The ICANN Board looks forward to receiving the DNSO report 
  on dispute resolution in the near future, so that it may be considered at the 
  ICANN Board meeting at the end of August.</P>
<P>I thank the Committee for the opportunity to present this report, and look 
  forward to answering any questions you might have.</P>
