<P>At the August '99 ICANN meeting in Santiago a <a href="santiago/santiago-resolutions.htm#anchor12997">Resolution</a> 
  was adopted to establish an ad hoc group to be charged with developing the objectives 
  and proposing structures for future policies in the area of numbering, especially 
  as required to meet global market needs and taking into account the convergence 
  of information technology services and networks. Under the <a href="santiago/santiago-resolutions.htm#anchor12997">Resolution</a>, 
  the group will include representatives of businesses, including telecom operators 
  and Internet service providers and trade organizations, the ASO Council, the 
  ICANN Board, and other legitimately interested parties. The group will present 
  an interim report before the second ICANN public meeting in 2000. A final report 
  from the ad hoc group will be presented to the ICANN Board prior to the Annual 
  Meeting in 2000.</P>
<P>ICANN actively encourages public comment on the draft charter language below. 
  Comments should be submitted through the <a href="http://www.icann.org/mb/adhoc/">Public 
  Comment Forum</a>. </P>

<P><font size="4">Proposed Charter for the Ad Hoc Group</font></P>
</B> 
<P>The ad hoc group should identify the key technology, commercial and economic 
  drivers that will affect addressing and numbering in the Internet. This assessment 
  must include current trends in services and network convergence and globalisation, 
  particularly those emerging from the telecommunications sector, as well as changes 
  in the demands on traditional IP address space. Examples of technology forces 
  to be considered include IMT 2000, 3GPP, and Bluetooth. The spread of these 
  new technologies could require changes to the addressing structure and, potentially 
  with it, how traffic is routed. The new technologies may also increase demand 
  for addresses even with no changes in the structures, by virtue of being layered 
  on top of IP.</P>
<P>The ad hoc group shall focus on the future demands and impacts these new technologies 
  will have on IP address space and its administration. Particular attention must 
  be given towards global policy formation and the identification of any requirements 
  to Internet addressing in the future. The ad hoc group shall clearly identify 
  technologies and evolution that can be implemented by layering them on top of 
  IPv4/IPv6 and whether technology, rather than merely policy, changes are required.</P>
<P>Central to the success of the group will be the resolution of the requirements 
  of new technologies with the Internet community. The resolution is needed to 
  avoid any difficulties that could occur through the implementation of new addressing 
  and numbering schemes.</P>

</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3> 
<P>The ad hoc group shall include representation from those specified within the 
  Resolution passed at the ICANN meeting held in Santiago 8/99 and take due account 
  of the need for a wide representation of interest and global diversity. </P>
<P>The following list of participants is proposed.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Representatives chosen by each of the Regional Internet Registries</LI>
  <LI>Representative(s) chosen by the Internet Architecture Board&#9;</LI>
  <LI>Representatives chosen by ISP Trade Associations&#9;</LI>
  <LI>Representatives chosen by Industry (3GPP, Bluetooth, IMT2000) </LI>
  <LI>Representatives chosen by Telecommunications operators </LI>
  <LI>Representatives chosen by the ICANN Board</LI>
</UL>
<P>Such a structure is considered to embrace all key parties and comply with the 
  above requirements </P>

</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>
<P>In order to progress work within the challenging timescale set out in the ICANN 
  Resolution the following approach is proposed:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>An initial meeting of participants who attend the November ICANN meeting 
    in LA to scope out work, assign tasks and set key milestones for each activity.</LI>
  <LI>Work to be progressed by e-mail and conference call links as required. A 
    mailing list will support the activities of the ad hoc group.</LI>
  <LI>At each key milestone information shall be posted on the ICANN web site 
    for open comment and further input which will then be considered by the ad 
    hoc group.</LI>
  <LI>All conclusions/recommendations shall be posted on the ICANN web site for 
    public comment (dates for posting to be agreed and published at the LA meeting).</LI>
