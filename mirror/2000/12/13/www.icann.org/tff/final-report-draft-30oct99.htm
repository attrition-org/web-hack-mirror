<P><font face="Arial"><b><a name="1"></a>I. Executive Summary and Recommendations</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">At the request of the Board of Directors, ICANN President 
  Michael Roberts convened a task force composed of ten representatives of Internet 
  IP address registries and domain name registries and registrars to consider 
  relevant issues concerned with creation of permanent funding arrangements for 
  ICANN. The task force has met four times, once in a face to face meeting in 
  Santiago, Chile, and three times via teleconference. It has reviewed the funding 
  assumptions contained in ICANN's chartering documents and in the U.S. Government's 
  White Paper on Management of the Internet Domain Name System. It has also considered 
  a variety of issues related to the process and procedures by which the ICANN 
  budget is formulated and approved, including the sources and amounts of the 
  expenses contained in the current fiscal year's budget. Finally, it has deliberated 
  on the most appropriate means by which the annual expense budgets should be 
  apportioned to the registry and registrar communities, which receive the benefit 
  of ICANN's technical coordination and policy development activities. These topics 
  are discussed and the views of the Task Force are set forth in sections III 
  and IV of this report.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force has developed twelve recommendations, within 
  four topic areas, for further action by the ICANN Board and staff. These are 
  stated below, with supporting material referenced in the body of the report.</font></P>
</FONT> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="1A"></a><b>A. Basic Cost Recovery Principle</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial"><I><FONT SIZE=1><font size="2">(1) The TFF recommends that 
  for the foreseeable future the basic funding needs of ICANN be supported by 
  IP address registries and domain name registries and registrars. As articulated 
  in the White Paper, ICANN constituents benefiting from ICANN's technical coordination 
  and policy development activities should contribute to its budget, whether individually 
  or through intermediary fee aggregating organizations.</font></font></i></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="1B"></a><b>B. Improvements to ICANN 
    Budget Process</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The TFF believes that ICANN's budget process needs 
  to be improved in future iterations to give the entities providing the funds 
  -- the domain name and address registries and registrars -- a formal role in 
  the budgeting process. The goal of the Task Force's recommendations in this 
  area is greater accountability, predictability, participation, and transparency 
  in the budgeting process.</font></P>
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">(2) The TFF recommends that the budget proposed 
  by the President at the outset of the budget process should be directly transmitted 
  via email to each name and address registry and registrar for review and comment, 
  with adequate time for study and response. </font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">(3) The TFF recommends that the budget process 
  include a meeting among members of the ICANN Board and representatives of the 
  IP address registries and domain name registries and registrars to review the 
  proposed budget in detail and to seek consensus on areas of controversy. </font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">(4) The TFF recommends that ICANN provide the IP 
  address registries and domain name registries and registrars with a quarterly 
  update on ICANN's financial situation, including figures showing the degree 
  to which ICANN's revenues are exceeding or falling short of the approved budget.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">(5) In addition to the entities directly contributing 
  the funds to ICANN's cost-recovery program, the rest of the ICANN community 
  must have a fair opportunity to review the proposed budget and participate in 
  the consensus-development process. The Task Force recommends that ICANN require 
  that the proposed annual budget be placed on the agenda for at least one Public 
  Forum prior to adoption.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">(6) As an interim measure to build greater accountability 
  and transparency into the budgeting budgeting process -- while recognizing the 
  difficulty that ICANN staff currently has in making budget projections for a 
  startup organization that has not completed many of its transitional activities 
  -- the TFF recommends that ICANN prepare and present to the community for public 
  review and comment a detailed multiyear budget and financial analysis for the 
  next fiscal year not later than the end of the first quarter of 2000. A detailed 
  multiyear budget and financial analysis would help to foster confidence in the 
  long-term integrity of the budgeting process.</font></P>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="1C"></a><b>C. Allocation of FY99-00 
    Budget Among Classes of Contributors</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">(7) The TFF believes that the annual revenue budget 
  for continuing expenses should be allocated among the three major groupings 
  of (i) IP address registries, (ii) domain name registries, and (iii)domain name 
  registrars on a proportional basis. TFF has considered a range of alternatives 
  for such allocations and recommends that the proportions for the current transitional 
  budget year (beginning 7/1/99 and ending 6/30/00) should be 55% to gTLD registrars 
  and registry, 35% to ccTLD registries, and 10% to IP address registries. Within 
  each funding community, fair and proportional formulas will be developed, as 
  described in this report, to further allocate funding amounts to individual 
  organizations.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">(8) TFF has reviewed the Board's approved budget 
  for the current fiscal year and the recently submitted projection of estimated 
  actual income and expense for the year, and recommends that the amount of income 
  to be allocated according to the proportional formulas contained in recommendation 
  7 should be $4,275,000.</font></P>
</FONT></i> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="1D"></a><b>D. Implementation of Funding 
    Formula</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">(9) TFF recommends that the funding allocations 
  and formulas contained in this report and its recommendations be included in 
  agreements to be executed between ICANN and the registry and registrar organizations.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">(10) The TFF recommends that ICANN implement a 
  budget mechanism to correct over- and under-recovery of budgeted amounts. Specifically, 
  the TFF recommends that budget deviations under 10% should flow into the next 
  fiscal year's budget process, while deviations over 10% should be dealt with 
  by an interim budget adjustment by the ICANN Board after a full public comment 
  and consensus-development process.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">(11) TFF recommends that the ICANN staff work with 
  representatives of the registry and registrar communities to develop necessary 
  implementation details to support quarterly invoicing of amounts due to ICANN.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">(12) TFF agrees with the Board that ICANN's supporting 
  organizations and At Large Membership should be financially self-supporting. 
  It further recommends that certain activities, such as the processing of registrar 
  accreditation applications, be identified for special purpose funding so that 
  inadvertent subsidies do not creep into the ICANN financial structure.</font></P>

<P> <font face="Arial"><b><a name="2A"></a>A. Creation of Task Force</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">In a letter to ICANN dated July 8, 1999, the U.S. Department 
  of Commerce made the following comment: </font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Arial">"In carefully reviewing your [June 15, 1999 Status Report] 
      report, and the considerable progress made toward establishing the structures 
      for representative decision making contemplated in the White paper, there 
      is still important work to be done: </font></P>
    <DIR> 
      <DIR> 
        <P><font face="Arial">"- ICANN should eliminate the $1 per-year, per-domain 
          name registration user fee. Although the user fee may be determined 
          to be an appropriate method for funding ICANN's activities, it is controversial. 
          We believe a permanent financing method should not be adopted until 
          after the nine elected members are added to the ICANN Board in November. 
          By taking such a step, ICANN will ensure that this important decision 
          is made in accordance with the representative, bottom-up process that 
          is essential for ICANN to carry out its mission. In the meanwhile, we 
          will work with ICANN and the entire Internet community, to the extent 
          permitted by law, to obtain interim resources for ICANN. "</font></P>
      </DIR>
    </DIR>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Arial">In response to this comment, the ICANN Board unanimously 
  adopted the following resolutions at its teleconference meeting on July 26, 
  1999:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Arial">WHEREAS, the budget adopted on May 27, 1999, by Resolution 
      99.55 established the variable component of the registrar accreditation 
      fee at $1 per registration-year;</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial">WHEREAS, that $1 component has recently been the subject 
      of controversy, causing the U.S. Department of Commerce to request that 
      ICANN suspend collection of the fee until the matter can be considered by 
      a Board including directors selected by ICANN's supporting organizations;</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial">WHEREAS, various accredited registrars have announced 
      that they intend to voluntarily pay the $1 component in the event its collection 
      is suspended;</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial">WHEREAS, that Board would benefit from additional views 
      from name and address registry administrators and registrars, which will 
      provide a principal source of ICANN's funding on an ongoing basis;</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial">RESOLVED [resolution 99.61], the Interim President and 
      Chief Executive Officer is authorized to suspend collection of the $1 variable 
      component of the registrar accreditation fee until further action by the 
      Board;</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [resolution 99.62], the Interim President 
      and Chief Executive Officer is directed to convene a President's Task Force 
      on Funding, chaired by him and also consisting of representatives chosen 
      by him from IP address registries, domain-name registrars, and administrators 
      of gTLD and ccTLD registries, and charged with formulating recommendations 
      on cost-recovery mechanisms that fairly apportion ICANN's funding needs, 
      as reflected in the budget that has been adopted, among the Internet name 
      and address registry administrators and registrars and possibly other parties;</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial">FURTHER RESOLVED [resolution 99.63], based on the input 
      of the President's Task Force on Funding and such consultation with staff 
      and legal counsel as he deems appropriate, the Interim President and Chief 
      Executive Officer is directed to have posted a preliminary report on funding 
      alternatives on the ICANN web site in advance of the Board meeting scheduled 
      for August 25 and 26, 1999, in Santiago, Chile, with further consideration 
      of this matter to be as directed by Board resolution at that meeting or 
      otherwise.</font></P>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>1. Budget Process</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Article XI, Section 4, the ICANN Bylaws define 
  the process by which the ICANN Board is to adopt its annual budget:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><U>"Annual Budget</u>. The President shall prepare 
    and, at least forty-five (45) days prior to the commencement of each fiscal 
    year, submit to the Board, a proposed annual budget of the Corporation for 
    the next fiscal year. The proposed budget shall identify anticipated revenue 
    sources and levels and shall, to the extent practical, identify anticipated 
    material expense items by line item. The Board shall adopt an annual budget 
    and shall publish the adopted Budget on the Web Site." </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">See &lt;<a href="../general/bylaws.htm#XI">http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#XI</a>&gt;. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As required by this provision, ICANN's President 
  prepared and submitted to the Board a proposed budget for the fiscal year starting 
  July 1, 1999. The budget was posted for public review and comment and discussed 
  at ICANN's first public meetings in Singapore, March 2-4, 1999. Following a 
  further comment period, the Board approved the budget at its May 25-27 meetings 
  in Berlin. See &lt;<a href="../berlin/berlin-resolutions.html#7">http://www.icann.org/berlin/berlin-resolutions.html#7</a>&gt;. 
  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>2. Current budget status</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 1999-2000 budget adopted in May, 1999 provided 
  for total revenue of $5.9 million, total expenditures of $4.2 million and total 
  capital equipment purchases, contribution to operating reserve and provision 
  for prior year loss of $1.7 million. See &lt;<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/budget.htm">http://www.icann.org/general/budget.htm</a>&gt;. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Based on estimated actual expenses in the first 
  quarter of FY99-00, ending September 30, 1999, and other financial developments 
  since the budget was adopted, the projected total revenue for this fiscal year 
  has been revised downward to $4.977 million. Total operating expenses are now 
  projected at $3.246 million, resulting in an operating surplus of $1.731 million. 
  This amount, if realized at fiscal year end, would be sufficient to retire total 
  working capital loans of $1.025 million and provide working capital for the 
  corporation in the amount of $706,000 at the beginning of the next fiscal year. 
  Additional detail on the revised financial projections for the current year 
  may be found in <a href="http://www.icann.org/tff/final-report-appendix-a-30oct99.htm">Appendix 
  A,</a> below.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>3. Transitional nature of budget</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force noted that the current budget is transitional 
  in nature, meaning that some start-up expenses will not be repeated in future 
  years, and that some expected ongoing expenses have been avoided during the 
  course of ICANN's start-up phase. The Task Force also acknowledged ICANN's need 
  for a degree of budgetary flexibility in light of the unreliability of ICANN's 
  current budget figures, attributable to ICANN's young age, limited experience 
  with the actual costs and expenses entailed in its policymaking and consensus-development 
  activities, and to the lack of steady income from registry or registrar sources.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Other factors contributing to budget volatility include 
  ICANN's inability thus far to rely on agreements for payments from registries 
  and registrars, delays in hiring staff, and reliance on short term loans to 
  meet working capital requirements. Taken together, these factors counsel against 
  an overly rigid approach to budgeting, and in favor of some flexibility for 
  year-to-year adjustments up or down based on operational experience, if coupled 
  with an inclusive and transparent consultative process.</font></P>
</FONT> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>4. One-time expenses</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">Included in ICANN's 1999-2000 budget are several one-time 
  start-up expenses. To account for such items as they arise, the Task Force agrees 
  that ICANN will require a mechanism whereby its operating budget can, subject

  that ICANN received total income of $707,870 (including $171,650 in donated

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">As part of its obligation to foster and maintain the operational 
  stability of the Internet, the ICANN Board has adopted a plan to create an operating 
  reserve in an amount equal to one year's operating expense. Contributions to 
  the operating reserve are intended to be spread out over several years. As with 
  the start-up loan repayment obligations, these reserve contributions will disappear 
  once the operating reserve has been fully funded.</font></P>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">In addition, ICANN is likely to be confronted from time 
  to time with other non-recurring expenses, such as extraordinary legal expenses. 
  These expenses should be addressed at the time they occur, rather than burdening 
  the existing, dedicated operating budget.</font></P>
<P> <font face="Arial"><b><a name="3B"></a>B. Possible future expenses - not yet 
  budgeted</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force also discussed the possibility of future 
  expenses not yet reflected in the ICANN budget. Even within the confines of 
  ICANN's narrow mandate to manage technical coordination functions, the Task 
  Force agreed that there might arise recurring operational expenses beyond the 
  categories currently defined in the ICANN budget, and that the budget process 
  must be able to accommodate such new operational expense categories.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">For example, the DNS root name server operators currently 
  provide their services voluntarily, without reimbursement from the Internet 
  community they serve. The Task Force discussed the possibility that ICANN may 
  need to defray the costs associated with the operation of root name servers 
  in the future.</font></P>
<P> <font face="Arial"><a name="3C"></a><b>C. Controls on ICANN Budget</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">A central concern of the Task Force has been the need to 
  place some meaningful controls on the future size and growth of the ICANN budget. 
  There are both philosophical and practical elements to this concern. The philosophical 
  basis for limiting ICANN's budget is rooted in the notion that ICANN is a limited-purpose 
  technical coordination entity; however, ICANN is likely to come under pressure 
  to expand its reach into areas outside its narrow mandate. Controls on ICANN's 
  budget are an important safeguard against mission creep and the unrestrained 
  budget bloat that might enable it. Moreover, there is a practical need among 
  the registries and registrars for predictability in ICANN's year-to-year budgets. 
  The registries and registrars must themselves make budgets and business plans 
  that are not vulnerable to significant surprise financial obligations newly 
  imposed by ICANN. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">At the same time, for the reasons set forth in Section (B), 
  above, the need for firm and reliable controls on the ICANN budget must be balanced 
  against the occasional need for extraordinary one-time expenses and/or new categories 
  of operational expense within ICANN's limited technical coordination mandate.

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>1. Mechanisms to address over- and under-recovery</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">Recognizing the need to balance firm budget controls against 
  necessary flexibility, the Task Force discussed a staff proposal that ICANN 
  handle both over- and under-recovery in a uniform way. Depending upon the design 
  of the funding formula, the steady exponential growth of the Internet's domain 
  name system might generate greater revenues to ICANN than are required by its 
  budget. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">As a non-profit, ICANN is obligated to recover its costs, 
  but only its costs. Under-recovery presents ICANN with the difficult task of 
  meeting its budget by raising additional funds from those already paying; over-recovery 
  presents ICANN with the need to prevent future over-recovery, and the need to 
  credit existing excess funds so as to reduce future obligations accordingly.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The staff proposal, with which the Task Force is in general 
  agreement, is for budget deviations under 10% to simply flow into the next fiscal 
  year's budget process. Deviations over 10% would require an interim budget adjustment 
  by the ICANN Board after a full public comment and consensus-development process.</font></P>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&#9;<b>2. Surcharges for extraordinary expenses</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">One particular form of under-recovery discussed above is 
  the potential need for one-time surcharges for extraordinary expenses such as 
  prior year loss or the creation of an operating budget reserve. The Task Force 
  generally agreed that all such surcharges should be addressed during the course 
  of ICANN's annual budgeting process, except in the case of an ongoing under-recovery 
  greater than 10% below ICANN's approved budget. In that case, the Board should 
  have the ability to initiate an interim budget adjustment, subject to a full 
  public comment and consensus-development process.</font></P>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>3. Limits on cost recovery amounts</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">Task Force members, and the DNS community generally, feel 
  strongly that the mechanisms established for the recovery of ICANN's operating 
  expenses should have built-in limits such that mere operation of a revenue formula 
  does not generate income over and above approved expense targets. For instance, 
  this is a major disadvantage of a formula based solely on numbers of domain 
  names assigned and why that particular approach has been discarded in the recommendations 
  of the Task Force.</font></P>
</FONT> 
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b><a name="3D"></a>D. Future budget process</b></font></p>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force agreed that ICANN's budget process needs 
  to be improved in future iterations to give the entities providing the funds 
  -- the domain name and address registries and the gTLD name registrars -- a 
  formal role in the budgeting process. The goal of the Task Force's recommendations 
  in this area is greater accountability, predictability, participation, and transparency 
  in the budgeting process.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">In particular, the budget proposed by the President at the 
  outset of the budget process should be directly transmitted via email to each 
  name and address registry and each gTLD name registrar for review and comment, 
  with adequate time for study and response. As a second element of the budgeting 
  process, a meeting should be convened among the ICANN Board and representatives 
  of the gTLD and ccTLD registries, the address registries, and the gTLD registrars 
  (perhaps structured like the Task Force on Funding) to review the proposed budget 
  in detail and to seek consensus on areas of controversy. As a third element, 
  the registries and registrars should be given a quarterly update on ICANN's 
  financial situation, including figures showing the degree to which ICANN's revenues 
  are exceeding or falling short of the approved budget.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">In addition to the entities directly contributing the funds 
  to ICANN's cost-recovery program, the rest of the ICANN community must have 
  a fair opportunity to review the proposed budget and participate in the consensus-development 
  process. The Task Force recommends that ICANN require that the proposed annual 
  budget to be placed on the agenda for at least one Public Forum prior to adoption.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">As an interim measure to build greater accountability and 
  transparency into the budgeting budgeting process, while recognizing the difficulty 
  that ICANN staff currently has in making budget projections for a startup organization 
  that has not completed many of its transitional activities, the Task Force recommends 
  that ICANN should prepare and present to the community for public review and 
  comment a detailed multiyear budget and financial analysis for the next fiscal 
  year not later than the end of the first quarter of 2000. A detailed multiyear 
  budget and financial analysis would help to foster confidence in the long-term 
  integrity of the budgeting process.</font></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><font face="Arial"><b><a name="4"></a>IV. Allocating the ICANN Budget</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Given the White Paper's mandate that ICANN be funded on 
  a cost-recovery basis by its global private sector constituents, the Task Force 
  has considered the difficult problem of fairly allocating ICANN's annual budget 
  among the entities with which ICANN is expected to enter contracts: the name 
  and address registries and registrars. The Task Force analyzed a range of principles 
  and criteria on which to divide the budgetary pie, then proceeded to apply them 
  to ICANN's present realities to determine a fair allocation of shares.</font></P>
<P> <font face="Arial"><b><a name="4A"></a>A. Principles for fair allocation</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force agreed on two general principles to guide 
  its analysis of budget allocation forumulas.</font></P>
</FONT> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>1. All ICANN constituents benefiting from 
    ICANN's coordination and pro-competition efforts should contribute to its 
    budget.</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">This is the principle articulated in the White Paper. Put 
  another way, the name and address registries and registrars (the parties with 
  whom ICANN is expected to have contractual relationships) are the entities through 
  which the global Internet's private sector financial support should be obtained.</font></P>
</FONT> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>2. Not-for-profit and for-profit constituents 
    should be treated equally, as both types of bodies need to pay their fair 
    dues, on the user-pays principle.</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force also agreed that the funding formulas should 
  not vary according to the for-profit or not-for-profit status of a given registry 
  or registrar. The vast diversity of business models and national business laws 
  makes any principled distinction among registrars and registries on that basis 
  ultimately infeasible. Instead, in applying the user-pays principle, registries 
  and registrars should pay according to a formula that fairly approximates the 
  global distribution of benefits from ICANN's technical coordination and pro-competition 
  efforts.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force does believe that some principled distinctions 
  can and should be drawn on the basis of a realistic assessment of ability to 
  pay. In contrast, the Task Force rejected, at least for the moment, the proposition 
  that ICANN's cost recovery mechanism should be based on a cost accounting formula 
  in which the costs of specific activities are allocated to the presumed beneficiaries 
  of those activities. Some Task Force members indicated that they opposed the 
  proposition on the grounds that cost accounting seldom if ever satisfies desires 
  for fair apportionment of costs. Other Task Force members believe that the practical 
  impossibility of accurate cost accounting during ICANN's start-up phase, together 
  with likely shifts in ICANN's policymaking focus over the coming year, render 
  cost accounting an imprudent basis for allocation for the time being.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><b><a name="4B"></a>B. Proposed ICANN-NSI-DoC agreements</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">During the course of the Task Force's deliberations, a set 
  of proposed agreements among ICANN, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and Network 
  Solutions, Inc. ("NSI"), was announced. Because these proposed agreements contain 
  provisions of direct relevance to any ICANN funding mechanism, the Task Force 
  reviewed them in detail.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">In particular, the Task Force focused on three of the proposed 
  agreements: the Registry Agreement (between ICANN and NSI the registry); the 
  Registrar Accreditation Agreement; and the Transition Agreement.</font></P>
</FONT> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>1. Funding obligation of NSI as registry</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">The ICANN-NSI Registry Agreement establishes the following 
  funding obligation on NSI in its capacity as the registry for the .com, .net, 
  and .org generic top level domains:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Arial">"6. <U>NSI Registry-Level Financial Support of ICANN</U>. 
      NSI, in its role as operator of the registry for the Registry TLDs, shall 
      pay the gTLD registry-level fees adopted by ICANN in conformance with Section 
      4 of this Agreement, provided such fees are reasonably allocated among all 
      gTLD registries that contract with ICANN and provided further that, if NSI's 
      share of the total gTLD registry-level fees are or are budgeted to be in 
      excess of $250,000 in any given year, any such excess must be expressly 
      approved by gTLD registries accounting, in aggregate, for payment of two-thirds 
      of all gTLD registry-level fees. NSI shall pay such fees in a timely manner 
      throughout the Term of this Agreement, and notwithstanding the pendency 
      of any dispute between NSI and ICANN. NSI agrees to prepay $250,000 toward 
      its share of gTLD registry-level fees at the time of signing of this Agreement."</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Arial">Several features of this section warrant comment. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The proposed mechanism provides that NSI will pay approved 
  fees applicable to gTLD registries, with several conditions. First, the fees 
  must be approved pursuant to Section 4 of the Agreement, which states:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Arial">"4. <U>General Obligations of ICANN</U>. With respect 
      to all matters that impact the rights, obligations, or role of NSI, ICANN 
      shall during the Term of this Agreement:</font></P>
    <DIR> 
      <DIR> 
        <P><font face="Arial">"(A) exercise its responsibilities in an open and 
          transparent manner;</font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial">"(B) not unreasonably restrain competition and, 
          to the extent feasible, promote and encourage robust competition; </font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial">"(C) not apply standards, policies, procedures or 
          practices arbitrarily, unjustifiably, or inequitably and not single 
          out NSI for disparate treatment unless justified by substantial and 
          reasonable cause; and </font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial">"(D) ensure, through its reconsideration and independent 
          review policies, adequate appeal procedures for NSI, to the extent it 
          is adversely affected by ICANN standards, policies, procedures or practices."</font></P>
      </DIR>
    </DIR>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Arial">Second, the proposed section states that gTLD registry fees 
  must be "reasonably allocated among all gTLD registries that contract with ICANN." 
  Since NSI is, for the moment, the sole gTLD registry, this provision does not 
  bear particular relevance. The question of fair sub-allocation among gTLD registries 
  will arise if and when new gTLD registries are added to the root.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Third, the proposed section provides a cap on the NSI registry's 
  total annual funding obligation, with an override mechanism: "if NSI's share 
  of the total gTLD registry-level fees are or are budgeted to be in excess of 
  $250,000 in any given year, any such excess must be expressly approved by gTLD 
  registries accounting, in aggregate, for payment of two-thirds of all gTLD registry-level 
  fees." In other words, so long as NSI is paying 100% of the gTLD registry-level 
  fees, NSI can effectively veto any funding obligation in excess of $250,000 
  a year. </font></P>
</FONT> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>2. Funding obligation of NSI as accredited 
    registrar</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">The proposed Registrar Accreditation Agreement makes the 
  following provisions with respect to the funding obligations of registrars:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Arial">"II.L. <U>Accreditation Fees</U>. As a condition of 
      accreditation, Registrar shall pay accreditation fees to ICANN. These fees 
      consist of yearly and on-going components. </font></P>
    <DIR> 
      <DIR> 
        <P><font face="Arial">"1. The yearly component for the term of this Agreement 
          shall be US $5,000. Payment of the yearly component shall be due upon 
          execution by Registrar of this Agreement and upon each anniversary date 
          after such execution during the term of this Agreement (other than the 
          expiration date).</font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial">"2. Registrar shall pay the on-going component of 
          Registrar accreditation fees adopted by ICANN in accordance with the 
          provisions of Section II.C above, provided such fees are reasonably 
          allocated among all registrars that contract with ICANN and that any 
          such fees must be expressly approved by registrars accounting, in aggregate, 
          for payment of two-thirds of all registrar-level fees. … "</font></P>
      </DIR>
    </DIR>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Arial">Thus, accredited gTLD registrars must pay an accreditation 
  fee of $5,000 a year, together with an ongoing fee. The ongoing fee must be 
  comply with the following principles, which are identical to those contained 
  in the proposed Registry Agreement:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Arial">"II.C. <U>General Obligations of ICANN</U>. With respect 
      to all matters that impact the rights, obligations, or role of Registrar, 
      ICANN shall during the Term of this Agreement:</font></P>
    <DIR> 
      <DIR> 
        <P><font face="Arial">"1. exercise its responsibilities in an open and 
          transparent manner;</font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial">"2. not unreasonably restrain competition and, to 
          the extent feasible, promote and encourage robust competition;</font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial">"3. not apply standards, policies, procedures or 
          practices arbitrarily, unjustifiably, or inequitably and not single 
          out Registrar for disparate treatment unless justified by substantial 
          and reasonable cause; and</font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial">"4. ensure, through its reconsideration and independent 
          review policies, adequate appeal procedures for Registrar, to the extent 
          it is adversely affected by ICANN standards, policies, procedures or 
          practices."</font></P>
      </DIR>
    </DIR>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Arial">The proposed Registrar Accreditation Agreement also places 
  a key condition on the on-going component of ICANN's accreditation fees: the 
  fee structure "must be expressly approved by registrars accounting, in aggregate, 
  for payment of two-thirds of all registrar-level fees." At the moment, one company 
  -- NSI -- accounts for well over two-thirds of all gTLD registrar fees and has 
  an effective veto power over the on-going component of the registrar accreditation 
  fee.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">However, in the proposed Transition Agreement, which supplements 
  the Registrar Accreditation Agreement between ICANN and NSI, NSI agrees to the 
  following:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Arial">"4. NSI will approve the on-going component of Registrar 
      accreditation fees, as provided in Section II.L.2 of the Accreditation Agreement, 
      if its portion thereof does not exceed $2,000,000 annually. NSI agrees to 
      prepay $1,000,000 toward its share of the on-going component of its Registrar 
      accreditation fees at the time of signing of the Accreditation Agreement."</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Arial">Thus, NSI retains an effective veto -- for the time being 
  -- over any increase in on-going registrar accreditation fees when its share 
  exceeds $2,000,000 a year.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">In sum, the Task Force concludes that its recommended global 
  funding allocation formula should take into account the expected caps contained 
  in the proposed agreements: no more than $2,000,000 from NSI the gTLD registrar; 
  and no more than $250,000 from NSI the gTLD registry.</font></P>
<P> <font face="Arial"><a name="4C"></a><b>C. Aggregate shares among classes of 
  ICANN constituents</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force recommends that continuing revenue requirements 
  to support ICANN's transition budget for FY99-00 (July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2000) 
  be allocated among the name and address registries and registrars according 
  to the formula set forth below. In making this recommendation the Task Force 
  accompanies it with the caveat that although it believes these proportional 
  shares are fair and appropriate to the current circumstances of ICANN and the 
  registry/registrar communities, any such formula requires scrutiny over time, 
  and it assumes that this recommendation will be reviewed in connection with 
  development of the ICANN budget for FY00-01, commencing in the spring of 2000. 
  Further, the Task Force notes that due to parallel processes operating with 
  respect to its own work, the negotiations among ICANN, NSI and the USG over 
  pending contract agreements, and the development of ICANN's revised budget projection 
  for the current fiscal year, the percentages used herein are subject to rounding 
  and interpolation as applied to specific agreements to be executed following 
  Board action on the recommendations of the Task Force.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial">The gTLD registrars (and, more importantly, their customers)

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">The gTLD registry will also benefit directly and tangibly

  the competitive registrars for every domain name registered in the .com, .net,

<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force believes that a total allocation of 55% to 
  the gTLD registrars and registries was appropriate, and that the division between 
  registrar and registry fees should calculated according to a 10:1 ratio, or 
  50% from the gTLD registrars and 5% from the gTLD registry.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">There was discussion among the members of the Task Force 
  as to whether all fees should be collected at the registry level, rather than 
  dividing the funding obligation among the registry and the registrars. At least 
  one member of the Task Force supported the aggregation of funding contributions 
  through the registries only. However the consensus of the Task Force was that 
  a number of practical considerations weigh heavily in favor of a two-tiered 
  funding structure for the total amount attributable to the gTLD registries and 
  registrars. Among these were (1) because a single company continues to serve 
  both as the gTLD registry and as a competitive gTLD registrar, a two-tiered 
  gTLD funding structure best ensured equal treatment among the competing registrars; 
  and (2) a two-tiered gTLD funding structure provides maximum flexibility for 
  the funding structure applicable to future gTLD registries (if any).</font></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force concluded that the share attributable to 
  ccTLD registries should be 35% of the budget. Because of the vast diversity 
  of operational and financial models among the ccTLDs, it was difficult to generalize 
  about their aggregate ability-to-pay.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Nevertheless, the Task Force noted that the ccTLD community 
  is now estimated to account for over 3 million domain name registrations, with 
  a rapid rate of growth Assuming income to support continuing expenses of $4.275 
  million for 1999-2000, the ccTLD registry share will be $1,496,000 (rounded). 
  Divided among the roughly 250 ccTLD registries currently in existence, the average 
  individual registry share would amount to less than $6,000 a year -- a little 
  more than one-tenth of one percent of the ICANN budget. Compared with the $250,000 
  annual contribution from the gTLD registry, this average seemed to the Task 
  Force to be an acceptable basis for calculating a fair aggregate share for the 
  ccTLD community.</font></P>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>4. IP address registries = 10%</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force concluded that the many differences between 
  domain names and IP addresses warranted differential treatment for the IP address 
  registry contribution. In particular, the Task Force noted that the IP address 
  registries are all member-supported non-profit entities that do not charge per-number 
  fees for IP address allocations. Put another way, the address space is thus 
  not "monetized" in the same manner as the domain name space. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force also discussed the differences between name-to-IP-number 
  resolution, which is carried out by the name registries and is essential to 
  the functionality required by most registrants, and reverse domain name mapping, 
  which is carried out the IP address registries and is not similarly mandatory.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force reviewed the annual budgets of the existing 
  regional Internet registries, and concluded that a 10% share of the ICANN budget 
  was appropriate. Assuming income to support continuing expenses of $4.275 million 
  for 1999-2000, the IP address registry share will be $428,000 (rounded).</font></P>

  individual organizations</b> <b> within classes of ICANN constituents</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">In addition to making recommendations about global aggregate 
  shares, the Task Force discussed a range of issues relating to how those shares 
  should be recovered from individual organizations. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The funding responsibilities of registries and registrars 
  must be translated into specific language within the agreements that will be 
  executed among the various parties. This is essential in order to meet the needs 
  for stability and predictability that both ICANN and the registry/registrar 
  organizations require. Accordingly, the Task Force undertook to review some 
  possible models by which distributions could be calculated and reduced to contract 
  language specific to individual entities.</font></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">Because there is at present only one gTLD registry, the 
  Task Force did not need to consider sub-distribution within this class of funding 
  organizations.</font></P>
</FONT>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>2. gTLD registrars</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">The gTLD registrar members of the Task Force reported a 
  broad consensus among gTLD registrars that a volume-based formula was the fairest 
  means to distribute the registrars' global funding share among these businesses, 
  and that the related calculations should be done on a quarterly basis.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force recommends that the following formula be 
  used to calculate the on-going portion of the gTLD registrars' fees under the 
  Registrar Accreditation Agreement:</font></P>
</FONT> 
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>Quarterly Fee = .25E x .5 x n/N x S</b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Where: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> .<b>25</b> = division into quarterly payments</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>E</b> = the annual ICANN budgeted income

  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Quarterly Fee = US$ 6,680</font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">In addition, the Task Force discussed the need for "floor" 
  and "ceiling" amounts for individual organizations. It believes these are appropriate, 
  but that the specifics of such amounts require further study. </font></P>
</FONT> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>3. ccTLD registries</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force agreed that the ccTLD registries should determine 
  among themselves the fairest formula for distributing the global ccTLD registry 
  share to individual ccTLD registries. There are a number of models that could 
  be used, including volume-based; banded tiers according to size; and a flat 
  fee per ccTLD registry.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force noted the difficulty that confronts the ccTLD 
  registries in reaching consensus on this issue. Across the vast diversity of 
  the ccTLD registry community, there are large and small ccTLDs; well-funded 
  and poorly-funded ccTLDs; professionally- and volunteer-managed ccTLDs; globally 
  accessible and geographically bounded ccTLDs; nationally-, regionally-, and 
  territorially-identified ccTLDs; government-administered and non-governmental 
  ccTLDs. Some ccTLD registries also act as registrars; others facilitate competitive 
  markets in domain name registration services. The interests of a large, well-funded 
  ccTLD may diverge from those of a small ccTLD administered by a volunteer from 
  the academic community. Compounding the difficulty is the lack of a single global 
  framework in which to discuss these issues, and the absence of many ccTLD registries 
  from existing forums on ICANN issues. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Thus, the Task Force is concerned that the ccTLD registries 
  utilize a credible and participatory process from which consensus can reasonably 
  emerge. The Task Force emphasizes that an acceptable result must meet the ccTLD 
  registries' need for fairness and predictability, and ICANN's need for workable 
  contract language.</font></P>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>4. IP address registries</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">As with the ccTLD registries, the Task Force believes that 
  the IP address registries should determine among themselves a fair division 
  of the global share, using a formula that is appropriate to the individual agreements 
  which the address registries will make with ICANN.</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P> <font face="Arial"><b><a name="4E"></a>E. Revenue from other sources</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Over the course of several meetings, the Task Force discussed 
  the question of the extent to which ICANN's core budget can or should be dependent 
  on sources of income other than contributions from registries and registrars. 
  This is a complex question on which there are no clear answers, especially at 
  a time when the ICANN budget is still in an early stage of development. However, 
  the following preliminary and tentative conclusions were arrived at.</font></P>
</FONT> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&#9;<b>1. Financial support from Supporting Organizations</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">The Supporting Organizations were made part of the ICANN 
  organization and Bylaws in an effort to ensure that the corporation received 
  the benefit of expert professional technical opinions on policy matters within 
  the scope of ICANN's charter. The SO's are loosely organized, bottom up organizations 
  designed to be inclusive with regard to participation of practicing professionals. 
  This style of organization, and the policy charter, do not lend themselves to 
  the type of organizational structure that could be relied on for significant 
  funding amounts, and the existence of a requirement for such amounts, perhaps 
  in the millions of dollars per SO, would be a substantial, if not fatal, impediment 
  to the accomplishment of the primary policy-making mission of the organizations. 
  The Task Force endorses the Board's current view that while it is entirely appropriate 
  for the SO's to fund their own relatively modest expenses, they should not be 
  regarded as sources of mainstream financial support for ICANN.</font></P>
</FONT> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>2. Financial support from Governments</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">Some Task Force members questioned why governments were 
  not expected to contribute to ICANN's budget. ICANN staff noted that ICANN's 
  mandate is to accomplish private-sector non-governmental management of its technical 
  coordination and policymaking functions, with private-sector funding. At the 
  same time, ICANN staff observed that ICANN will gladly accept contributions 
  from any legitimate source, including governments.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The Task Force recommends that ICANN continue to accept 
  voluntary contributions from legitimate sources, including governments, but 
  that the ICANN budget not become dependent upon governmental contributions.</font></P>
</FONT> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>3. Membership and meeting fees</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">Some Task Force members recommended that ICANN seek to raise 
  funds through membership and meeting fees and sponsorships. ICANN staff welcomed 
  this recommendation and will include further discussion of it in future budget 
  discussions, subject to the restriction imposed by current Board policy that 
  all ICANN events be made accessible to the largest possible audience.</font></P>
