<P>At the August '99 ICANN meeting in Santiago a <a href="../minutes/minutes-26august99.htm#99.79">Resolution</a> 
  was adopted to establish an ad hoc group to be charged with developing the objectives 
  and proposing structures for future policies in the area of numbering, especially 
  as required to meet global market needs and taking into account the convergence 
  of information technology services and networks. The group will include representatives 
  of businesses, including telecom operators and Internet service providers and 
  trade organizations, the ASO Council, the ICANN Board, and other legitimately 
  interested parties. The group will present an interim report before the second 
  ICANN public meeting in 2000. A final report from the ad hoc group will be presented 
  to the ICANN Board prior to the Annual Meeting in 2000.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B>
<P>Proposed Charter for the Ad Hoc group.</P>
</B> 
<P>The ad hoc group should identify the key technology, commercial and economic 
  drivers that will affect addressing and numbering in the Internet. Recognising 
  the risks of specifying modifications to core Internet technologies in a small 
  group that inevitably understands some elements of the picture better than others, 
  the group will identify issues, problems, risks, and opportunities, but is not 
  expected to propose, much less adopt, technical solutions to them. The assessment 
  must include current trends in services and network convergence and globalisation, 
  particularly those emerging from the telecommunications sector, as well as changes 
  in the demands on traditional IP address space. Examples of technology forces 
  to be considered include IMT 2000, 3GPP, and Bluetooth. The group will examine 
  and identify any characteristics of these applications that they believe are 
  so unusual as to challenge the Internet's technical tradition of an application-independent 
  basic architecture for addressing and routing structures. </P>
<P>The ad hoc group shall focus on the future demands and impacts these new technologies 
  will have on the administration of IP address space. Particular attention must 
  be given towards global policy formation and the identification of any requirements 
  to Internet addressing in the future. If the ad hoc group identifies areas in 
  which they believe changes to addressing architectures or other technologies 
  should be considered, they should clearly identify the problems that require 
  resolution rather than suggesting technical solutions so that appropriate responses 
  to those requirements can be considered in a broader more open and technically 
  responsive forum.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Additional information. </P>
</B> 
<P>The Ad Hoc Group will work through a dedicated ICANN Public Comment Forum on 
  the ICANN website. Representatives of the organizations specified within the 
  Resolution passed at the ICANN meeting held in Santiago 8/99 will be invited 
  to post their observations to this Forum. In order to progress work within the 
  challenging timescale set out in the ICANN Resolution the ICANN Board will invite 
  a small Editorial Group to co-ordinate the Forum.</P>
<P>All conclusions recommendations shall be posted on the ICANN web site for public 
  comment. </P>
