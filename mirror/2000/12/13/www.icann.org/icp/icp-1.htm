      <P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="Introduction"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Introduction</FONT></B></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial">The IANA is the overall authority
      for day-to-day administration of the Internet Domain Name System
      (DNS). IANA staff carry out administrative responsibilities for
      the assignment of IP Addresses, Autonomous System Numbers, Top
      Level Domains (TLDs), and other unique parameters of the DNS
      and its protocols. This document provides general information
      on IANA policy for administering the DNS. Instructions on procedures
      to be followed in requesting TLD delegations or changes are available
      on the website at iana.org.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="Top Level Structure"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Top
      Level Structure of the DNS</FONT></B></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial">The DNS structure contains a
      hierarchy of names. The root, or highest level, of the system
      is unnamed. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are divided into classes
      based on rules that have evolved over time. Most TLDs have been
      delegated to individual country managers, whose codes are assigned
      from a table known as <A HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1/en_listp1.html">ISO-3166-1</A>,
      which is maintained by an agency of the United Nations. These
      are called country-code Top Level Domains, or ccTLDs. In addition,
      there are a limited number of &quot;generic&quot; Top Level Domains
      (gTLDs), which do not have a geographic or country designation.
      Responsibility for adoption of procedures and policies for the
      assignment of Second Level Domain Names (SLDs), and lower level
      hierarchies of names, has been delegated to TLD managers, subject
      to the policy guidance contained in this document. Country code
      domains are each organized by a manager for that country. These
      managers are performing a public service on behalf of the Internet
      community. A list of current TLD assignments and names of the
      delegated managers can be accessed at <A HREF="http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld.htm">http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld.htm</A></FONT><FONT

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="Management"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">The
      Management of Delegated Domains</FONT></B></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial">As part of its responsibility
      for the overall coordination and management of the DNS, the IANA
      receives and processes all requests for new TLDs and for changes
      to existing TLDs. The following policies are applicable to management
      of TLDs. In general, the principles described here apply recursively
      to all delegations of the Internet DNS name space.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="a"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">(a) Delegation
      of a New Top Level Domain. Delegation of a new top level domain
      requires the completion of a number of procedures, including
      the identification of a TLD manager with the requisite skills
      and authority to operate the TLD appropriately. The desires of
      the government of a country with regard to delegation of a ccTLD
      are taken very seriously. The IANA will make them a major consideration
      in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions. Significantly interested
      parties in the domain should agree that the proposed TLD manager
      is the appropriate party. The key requirement is that for each
      domain there be a designated manager for supervising that domain's
      name space. In the case of ccTLDs, this means that there is a
      manager that supervises the domain names and operates the domain
      name system in that country. There must be Internet Protocol
      (IP) connectivity to the nameservers and electronic mail connectivity
      to the entire management, staff, and contacts of the manager.
      There must be an administrative contact and a technical contact
      for each domain. The administrative contact must reside in the
      country involved for ccTLDs. The IANA may choose to make partial
      delegations of a TLD when circumstances, such as those in a developing
      country, so dictate. It may also authorize a &quot;proxy&quot;
      DNS service outside of a developing country as a temporary form
      of assistance to the creation of Internet connectivity in new
      areas. [N.B. The IANA continues to receive inquiries about delegation
      of new gTLDs. This is a significant policy issue on which ICANN
      will conduct a careful study and review based on the established
      decision making procedures. Information about this study will
      be disseminated on the website at icann.org.]</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="b"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">(b) TLD Manager
      Responsibility. TLD managers are trustees for the delegated domain,
      and have a duty to serve the community. The designated manager
      is the trustee of the TLD for both the nation, in the case of
      ccTLDs, and the global Internet community. Concerns about &quot;rights&quot;
      and &quot;ownership&quot; of domains are inappropriate. It is
      appropriate, however, to be concerned about &quot;responsibilities&quot;
      and &quot;service&quot; to the community.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="c"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">(c) Fair Treatment.
      The designated manager must be equitable and fair to all groups
      in the domain that request domain names. Specifically, the same
      rules must be applied to all requests and they must be processed
      in a non-discriminatory fashion. The policies and procedures
      for the use of each TLD must be available for public inspection.
      Generally these are posted on web pages or made available for
      file transfer. While variations in policies and procedures from
      country to country are expected due to local customs and cultural
      values, they must be documented and available to interested parties.
      Requests from for-profit and non-profit companies and organizations
      are to be treated on an equal basis. No bias shall be shown regarding
      requests that may come from customers of some other business
      related to the TLD manager. For example, no preferential service
      for customers of a particular data network provider. There can
      be no stipulation that a particular application, protocol, or
      product be used.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="d"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">(d) Operational
      Capability. The TLD manager must do a satisfactory job of operating
      the DNS service for the domain. Duties such as the assignment
      of domain names, delegation of subdomains and operation of nameservers
      must be done with technical competence. This includes keeping
      the IANA or other higher-level domain manager advised of the
      status of the domain, responding to requests in a timely manner,
      and operating the database with accuracy, robustness, and resilience.
      Because of its responsibilities for the DNS, the IANA must be
      granted access to all TLD zones on a continuing basis. There
      must be a primary and a secondary nameserver that have IP connectivity
      to the Internet and can be easily checked via access to zones
      for operational status and database accuracy by the IANA.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="e"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">(e) Transfers
      and Disputes over Delegations. For transfer of TLD management
      from one organization to another, the higher-level domain manager
      (the IANA in the case of TLDs), must receive communications from
      both the old organization and the new organization that assure
      the IANA that the transfer is mutually agreed, and that the proposed
      new manager understands its responsibilities. It is also very
      helpful for the IANA to receive communications from other parties
      that may be concerned or affected by the transfer. In the event
      of a conflict over designation of a TLD manager, the IANA tries
      to have conflicting parties reach agreement among themselves
      and generally takes no action unless all contending parties agree.
      On a few occasions, the parties involved in proposed delegations
      or transfers have not been able to reach an agreement and the
      IANA has been required to resolve the matter. This is usually
      a long drawn out process, leaving at least one party unhappy,
      so it is far better when the parties can reach an agreement among
      themselves. It is appropriate for interested parties to have
      a voice in the selection of the designated manager.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="f"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">(f) Revocation
      of TLD Delegation. In cases where there is misconduct, or violation
      of the policies set forth in this document and RFC 1591, or persistent,
      recurring problems with the proper operation of a domain, the
      IANA reserves the right to revoke and to redelegate a Top Level
      Domain to another manager.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="g"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">(g) Subdelegations
      of Top Level Domains. There are no requirements for management
      of subdomains of TLDs, including subdelegations, beyond the requirements
      for TLDs stated in this document and <A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1591.txt">RFC
      1591</A>. In particular, all subdomains shall be allowed to operate
      their own domain nameservers, providing in them whatever information
      the subdomain manager sees fit, as long as it is true and correct.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="h"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">(h) Rights to
      Domain Names. The IANA has no special requirement for policies
      to be followed by TLD managers in connection with disputes over
      rights to domain names other than those stated generally in this
      document and <A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1591.txt">RFC
      1591</A>. Please note, however, that use of a particular domain
      name may be subject to applicable laws, including those concerning
      trademarks and other types of intellectual property.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="i"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">(i) Uses of
      ISO 3166-1 Table. The IANA is not in the business of deciding
      what is and what is not a country. The selection of the <A HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1.html">I</A><A
      HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1/en_listp1.html">SO-3166-1</A>
      list as a basis for country code top-level domain names was made
      with the knowledge that ISO has a procedure for determining which
      entities should be and should not be on that list. For more information
      about the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency, please see the following
