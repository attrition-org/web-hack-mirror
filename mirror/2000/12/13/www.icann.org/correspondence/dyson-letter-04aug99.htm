  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Honorable Thomas J. Bliley, 
    Jr.<br>
    Chairman<br>
    The <a href="http://www.house.gov/commerce/">House Committee on Commerce</a><br>
    2125 Rayburn House Office Building<br>
    Washington, D.C. 20515</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Chairman Bliley:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&#9;I am writing to answer <a href="http://com-notes.house.gov/cchear/hearings106.nsf/b2cc6be46b2b2d2285256720007e4972/9ec61abfc109fc41852567bd0073b741?OpenDocument">your 
    letter of July 28, 1999</a>, asking for information about communications between 
    ICANN and the Department of Justice. As several members noted during the recent 
    hearing of your Committee at which I was privileged to testify, the creation 
    and operation of ICANN is a complicated undertaking, and we appreciate any 
    opportunity to better educate and inform the Congress and the public about 
    what ICANN is doing and what we hope to achieve.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&#9;Your inquiry apparently was 
    prompted by an e-mail message that was one of many provided to the Committee 
    by ICANN in response to your earlier letter of June 22. Your statement that 
    the conversation reported in this e-mail "appear[s] to be highly inappropriate" 
    is puzzling, and appears to be based on a misunderstanding about the nature 
    of the conversation described in this message. The right to petition government 
    is constitutionally protected, and indeed is one of the freedoms that has 
    distinguished the American form of government. Members of the Board, staff 
    and counsel of ICANN have had a number of discussions with various members 
    of the executive and legislative branches of government since ICANN's formation 
    in late 1998. The common focus of those conversations has been ICANN's mission 
    and objectives, and the obstacles that remain to accomplishing those objectives. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&#9;In this particular case, ICANN's 
    counsel was urging the Department of Justice, which as part of its official 
    mission is the principal advocate for competition within the Executive Branch, 
    to urge the more rapid transition of domain name registration services from 
    a single monopoly government contractor to a competitive market. The Department's 
    representatives listened to this request, and agreed to consider it; that 
    was the entire sum and substance of the conversation. We do not believe that 
    this exercise of the constitutionally-protected right to petition government 
    could even arguably be considered inappropriate. Indeed, I assume you and 
    other members of this Committee receive regular requests to consider various 
    actions, perhaps even related to this same subject.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&#9;As the e-mail in question indicates, 
    this discussion did not involve the pending antitrust investigation of NSI, 
    which had been ongoing for some time. But if it had, that would certainly 
    also have been completely appropriate. ICANN is charged, both by its Memorandum 
    of Understanding with the Department of Commerce and by a clear Internet community 
    consensus, with replacing the current non-competitive domain name registration 
    system with a competitive system, where price, quality of service and other 
    important criteria relating to domain name registrations are determined by 
    the marketplace, not by a monopoly provider. The Department of Justice is 
    charged with enforcing the antitrust laws. One possible avenue from monopoly 
    to competition in domain name registration services is through enforcement 
    of the antitrust laws. Thus, it is appropriate for ICANN, through its counsel, 
    to discuss with representatives of the Department of Justice ICANN's views 
    of the antitrust enforcement issues associated with the current monopoly name 
    registration situation, and for ICANN to advocate antitrust enforcement action 
    if it believes such would be appropriate. ICANN is entitled to express its 
    views on such subjects, just as any other person or entity may.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&#9;With this background, let me 
    respond on behalf of the Initial Board of Directors of ICANN to your specific 
    questions.</font></p>
  <dir> 
    <dir> 
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>1.&#9;Provide a listing 
        of all communications between the Department of Justice and ICANN.</b></font></p>
    </dir>
  </dir>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&#9;We are unable to provide such 
    a listing. We are not aware of any records of such communications other than 
    the e-mail message previously provided. Nevertheless, we can state that there 
    have been a number of discussions between counsel for ICANN and Department 
    of Justice lawyers over the several months of ICANN's existence. Those conversations 
    have generally concerned the antitrust and competitive policy issues relating 
    to domain name registrations. We are aware of no other substantive conversations 
    between a representative of ICANN and any official or employee of the Department 
    of Justice.</font></p>
  <dir> 
    <dir> 
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>2.&#9;Provide all records 
        relating to such communications.</b></font></p>
    </dir>
  </dir>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&#9;The Committee is already in 
    possession of all such records.</font></p>
  <dir> 
    <dir> 
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>3. &#9;Discuss the ICANN 
        Board's knowledge of, or subsequent authorization of, the communication 
        by counsel reflected in the e-mail message previously provided.</b></font></p>
    </dir>
  </dir>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&#9;To the best of my knowledge, 
    the ICANN Board was not aware of this particular communication prior to its 
    occurrence. Such communications are part of the ordinary activities of ICANN's 
    counsel and would not require nor normally generate prior notification or 
    approval. Questions about the ICANN Board's reaction to the conversation after 
    the fact appear to be based on the premise that this communication, or others 
    like it, was somehow inappropriate; since we do not believe this is the case, 
    we had no reason to instruct counsel to avoid such communications in the future. 
    In fact, the Board expects its counsel, in the ordinary course of carrying 
    out his responsibilities to ICANN and the ICANN Board, to continue to communicate 
    with Executive Branch agencies, members of the Legislative Branch and their 
    staffs, and any others with whom such communications are, in his judgment, 
    useful to support the efforts of ICANN to carry out its responsibilities.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&#9;I hope this is responsive to 
    your inquiry. On behalf of ICANN, let me reiterate that we are committed to 
    carrying out our responsibilities with respect to the transition of the management 
    of certain aspects of the Domain Name System from government control to the 
    private sector through a process that is open and transparent. As a part of 
    this, we are eager to work with this Committee and its staff to ensure that 
    you have all the information required to fully understand how this transition 
    is proceeding. As you know, we have offered to provide periodic briefings 
    to Committee staff on a bipartisan basis, in the hope of avoiding misunderstandings 
    such as the one that apparently prompted this particular inquiry. I look forward 
    to working with the Committee and its staff to ensure that all Members of 
    the Committee are fully informed about this difficult but important undertaking.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&#9;Please let me know if we can 
    provide any further information.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Sincerely,</font></p>
