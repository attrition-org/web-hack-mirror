      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Dear Mr. Roberts:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thank you for your recent response to my
      November letter. I appreciate the time you have taken to discuss
      my comments and observations regarding the monumental task that
      lies before you.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I am glad to hear of ICANN&#146;s continued
      commitment to openness and transparency, which is a crucial element
      to building private-sector consensus. I also appreciate your
      review of ICANN&#146;s structure and purpose as detailed in Department
      of Commerce&#146;s White Paper. While I am very familiar with
      the White Paper and the purpose behind the creation of ICANN,
      background information is helpful in laying the proper foundation
      for a relationship between our office and your organization.
      In a similar vein, I believe it is helpful to discuss Advocacy&#146;s
      background, as it will assist you in understanding the role that
      we have to play in this and other issue areas.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Office of Advocacy was created in 1976
      by the U.S. Congress to represent the viewpoints and interests
      of small businesses within the U.S. federal government's policy
      deliberations. Congress listed several primary functions for
      Advocacy. The two that are most applicable to this situation
      are:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(1) examine the role of small business
        in the American economy and the contribution which small businesses
        can make in improving competition, encouraging economic and social
        mobility for all citizens, restraining inflation, spurring production,
        expanding employment opportunities, increasing productivity,
        promoting exports, stimulating innovation and entrepreneurship,
        and providing an avenue through which new and untested products
        and services can be brought to the marketplace;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&#133;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">(9) recommend specific measures for creating
        an environment in which all businesses will have the opportunity
        to compete effectively and expand to their full potential, and
        to ascertain the common reasons, if any, for small business successes
        and failures.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">15 U.S.C. &sect; 634(b).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As part of our fulfillment of 15 U.S.C.
      &sect; 634(b)(1), we continually examine the role that small
      business plays in the economy and how different trends, policies,
      and technologies affect small business. Our studies have shown
      that e-commerce is a crucial tool for small businesses. For example:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">by 2002, 85 percent of small businesses
        are expected to conduct business via the Web;</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">currently, 61 percent of small businesses
        with 100 or fewer employees have access to the Internet;</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">currently, 35 percent of small businesses
        have a Web site; and</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">currently, 33 percent of small businesses
        do business transactions through that site.</FONT>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">You can find the full text of these economic
      studies on our Web page at &lt;http://www.sba.gov/advo/stats&gt;.
      Also, according to statistics that we have received from Network
      Solutions:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">there are currently more than 14 million
        registrations in .com, .net, and .org;</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">nearly 2/3 of all .com, .net, and .org
        registrations are by persons or entities companies within the
        United States;</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">83 percent of .com, .net, and .org is
        registered by small business (with 250 employees or less) for
        a total of approximately 7.7 million U.S. small businesses; and</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">70 percent of .com, .net, and .org is
        registered by micro small businesses (1 to 4 employees) for a
        total of approximately 6.5 million U.S. micro small businesses</FONT>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As you can see from these statistics, small
      businesses have made substantial investments in e-commerce and
      are the primary registrants of domain names. Furthermore, the
      technical management of the domain name system, Internet addressing,
      and Internet protocol will affect small businesses more than
      any other economic group that relies on the Internet. We will
      continue to monitor small business use of new technologies and
      publish our research. ICANN is welcome and, in fact, is encouraged
      to use our statistics in its deliberations. It would also be
      helpful for ICANN to gather &#150; and publish &#150; small business
      statistics from other countries as well in order to understand
      more fully the impact of its decisions on the new international
      economy.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Insofar as my initial letter was concerned,
      my goal in asking ICANN to consider adopting a procedural policy
      was to facilitate and thus maximize small business access to
      the ICANN process. In reading your letter, I am afraid that my
      message was not clear. I did not recommend that ICANN should
      bind itself to the Administrative Procedure Act, but rather ICANN
      should mimic the spirit of this law as a private organization
      with major responsibilities affecting so many. My concern is
      that all interested parties have a predictable and fair opportunity
      to participate in such an important process. We are always looking
      at alternative means of achieving a level playing field for small
      business. Therefore, if means other than the structure of the
      APA provide interested parties with the same opportunity to participate,
      we will strongly applaud ICANN&#146;s use of them.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In this connection, in recent months, I
      have noticed that the consensus-based private-sector process
      has developed many of the attributes that I was asking ICANN
      to ensure were present. First, the working groups, particularly
      Working Group B and Working Group C, have provided an excellent
      route for small businesses to participate in the ICANN process.
      The low cost and ease of participation have contributed to making
      it an open forum. Also, the interim and final reports conducted
      by the working groups provide a logical time for interested parties
      not able to participate in the working groups to comment.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Secondly, in almost every recent proceeding,
      ICANN has used longer comment deadlines. This crucial element
      will increase small business participation, which do not have
      the resources to respond to short deadlines. In addition, it
      will assist interested parties whose primary language is not
      English in participating.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Lastly, I have noted a growing sensitivity
      to small business concerns throughout the ICANN process. The
      recent release of domain name registration statistics by Network
      Solutions has underscored a point Advocacy has made for years
      &#150; that small businesses are an important part of the Internet
      and the largest users of domain names. In the discussion of both
      Working Groups B and C, participants raised the group&#146;s
      awareness of the needs of small business and the possible impact
      that any changes would have upon them.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Might I suggest that, regardless of which
      procedural policy ICANN uses, including private-sector consensus,
      it post this policy on its Web site. A clear explanation of how
      ICANN will interact with third parties would assist small business
      participants and individuals in their efforts to participate
      in the process.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I look forward to a long and mutually advantageous
      relationship between our office and ICANN. Best of luck to you
      in your efforts to expand the domain name space. We will be following
      the proceedings with great interest.</FONT></P>
