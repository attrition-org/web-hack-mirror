      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">It would be untenable for the United States
      government simply to order the creation of a new top-level domain
      for material harmful to minors. Rather, if the U.S. government
      wishes to see such a domain created, it will have to work within
      the ICANN policy process. The benefits of having such a domain,
      though, are clouded at best. If use of the domain is not made
      mandatory, its mere existence will do little to reduce access
      by minors to sexually explicit material on the World Wide Web.
      But any statute purporting to make use of the domain mandatory
      would raise serious constitutional problems.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Chairman and members of the Commission,
      I am very glad to be here today. I'm going to testify today wearing
      two hats. First, I'm the chair of an ICANN working group on the
      addition of new Internet top-level domains. Second, I'm a constitutional
      law professor at Wayne State University and the author of an
      article on Internet filtering software. I'm not speaking, though,
      on behalf of either ICANN, the working group or Wayne State University;
      rather, I'm speaking only for myself.</FONT></P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><A NAME="Background"></A><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Background</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I want to start by providing some background
      on the management of Internet names and addresses. Internet resources
      are typically identified by domain names such as www.copacommission.org.
      The domain name space is divided into top-level domains, or TLDs;
      each TLD is divided into second-level domains, or SLDs; and so
      on. Under a plan developed in 1984, there are seven &quot;generic,&quot;
      three-letter top-level domains: .com, .net, .org .edu, .gov (reserved
      for U.S. government sites) .mil (reserved for U.S. military sites),
      and .int (reserved for intergovernmental organizations). In addition,
      there are a whole lot of two-letter &quot;country code&quot;
      top-level domains, such as .jp, .us and .fr.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">When a user, looking for a particular Internet
      resource, types in a domain name, his computer looks to a set
      of local domain name servers that are specified within its software
      to find the Internet address corresponding to that domain name.
      Those local servers, if they don't know the answer, will kick
      the problem up to a higher level. At the top of the pyramid are
      a set of root servers. Whether a top-level domain is visible
      in the name space is determined by whether the root servers contain
      an entry corresponding to that domain. If a user types in a domain
      name incorporating a top-level domain that the root servers he
      consults don't recognize, then his computer will be unable to
      find any resource corresponding to that domain name.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Since 1992, the job of administering the
      &quot;A&quot; root server, from which all of the other root servers
      take their lead, has been undertaken by Network Solutions, Inc.,
      a private company, under cooperative agreements with the National
      Science Foundation and the Commerce Department. Since well before
      NSI entered the scene, overall policy oversight of the domain
      name system was in the hands of Dr. Jon Postel at the University
      of Southern California, under a contract with the Defense Department.
      NSI followed the directions of Dr. Postel in maintaining, and
      making changes to, the root servers.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">This system, however, wasn't stable. For
      one thing, as the Internet became increasingly international,
      it was incongruous for its management to be funded by U.S. government
      agencies charged with overseeing scientific research projects.
      Other countries saw the Internet as a global resource, not subject
      to the narrow whims of the U.S. government, and demanded a voice
      in its governance. For another thing, the existing domain-name
      management functions had no robust management structure and no
      formal accountability to the Internet community.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, the domain-name system was facing
      policy choices that were beyond the ability of the old system
      to resolve. Some people wanted to add many new top-level domains
      to the root zone; others opposed this. Some wanted the domain-name
      registration process to incorporate strong protection for trademark
      owners against the registration of names similar to their trademarks;
      others urged that these disputes should be left to the courts.
      Many people urged that other firms should be able to compete
      with Network Solutions in the business of registering domain
      names, but there was considerable argument over how this should
      be done. Different people suggested the creation of different
      new entities to help resolve these issues. These issues were
      thrashed out, for a period of several years, in what was sometimes
      called the &quot;DNS wars.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The United States government took a step
      towards resolving these issues by midwifing the birth of a new,
      private, nonprofit corporation, with an internationally representative
      board, called ICANN &#151; the Internet Corporation for Assigned
      Names and Numbers. The government announced that it would work
      with ICANN to transfer policy authority over the domain-name
      system, and specifically charged ICANN with developing policy
      for the addition of new top- level domains. Initially, the U.S.
      government proposed that even before ICANN was formed, the government
      should require the addition of five new top-level domains. In
      its final policy statement, called the White Paper, though, the
      government reversed that position. It concluded that it was better
      for ICANN to make these decisions itself, based on global input.
      The White Paper noted that &quot;the challenge of deciding policy
      for the addition of new domains will be formidable.&quot; It
      expressed support for new domains, but cautioned that &quot;in
      the short run, a prudent concern for the stability of the system
      suggests that expansion of [top-level domains] proceed at a deliberate
      and controlled pace to allow for evolution of the impact of the
      new [top- level domains] and well-reasoned evolution of the domain
      space.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN has since engaged in extensive deliberation
      relating to the possible creation of new top-level domains. In
      April, the body responsible, within ICANN, for originating policy
      recommendations on domain-name issues recommended to the ICANN
      Board that a limited number of new top-level domains be created,
      in the short term, in a measured and responsible manner. It referred
      to the possibility of introducing &quot;fully open top-level
      domains, restricted and chartered top-level domains with limited
      scope, non-commercial domains and personal domains.&quot; It
      cautioned, however, that there must be &quot;a responsible process
      for introducing new gTLDs, which includes ensuring that there
      is close coordination with organizations dealing with Internet
      protocols and standards.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">It's not at all clear that this whole process
      will go smoothly. ICANN is still feeling its way, and not all
      players in the Internet arena fully accept its authority. The
      U.S. government, indeed, hasn't yet relinquished its own policy
      authority over the root.</FONT></P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT><A NAME="Feasibility"></A><B><U><FONT
       FACE="Arial">Feasibility</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In one sense, it would be &quot;feasible&quot;
      for Congress to order, tomorrow, the addition of a top-level
      domain specifically intended for material harmful to minors.
      Both Network Solutions and ICANN are subject to U.S. jurisdiction.
      Congress could order Network Solutions to add the new domain
      to the root servers, and to host the new domain's registry; or
      it could order ICANN to find a registry to host the new domain,
      and to request NSI to make the appropriate root server modification.
      Congress has the raw power to do that.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">From the standpoint of the transition of
      domain-name policymaking authority to ICANN, though, such a move
      would be disastrous. ICANN is still finding its credibility as
      a body, independent of national governments, to govern Internet
      identifiers on behalf of the Internet community. For Congress
      to short-circuit ICANN's processes, ordering a particular top-level
      domain deployed without regard to ICANN's own choices, would
      strip the ICANN process of its integrity and would make it much
      harder for anyone to take ICANN seriously as an independent entity
      for Internet technical management.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Further, this would not be the end of government
      involvement in ICANN decision- making. Other governments would
      feel entitled to have their own preferences reflected in the
      domain name space. Other governments would come to ICANN and
      insist that there be top-level domains created to reflect their
      own policy preferences. Given the range of speech favored and
      disfavored by various world governments &#151; including speech
      promoting Naziism or hate, speech tarnishing the Muslim religion,
      and so on &#151; it is easy to imagine multiple calls by a wide
      range of governments for special top-level domains for speech
      they want to see ghettoized. Indeed, some governments would likely
      go farther and ask that ICANN use its own bureaucratic apparatus
      to enforce rules governing who could and could not register in
      a given domain.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">This would damage the U.S. government's
      effort to transfer domain-name management to a representative,
      bottom-up, private organization that could expand the name space
      while imposing minimalist rules. It could contribute to ICANN's
      failure &#151; and if ICANN fails, one likely result is a splintering
      of control, with the emergence of new sets of root servers not
      subject to U.S. authority at all. Alternatively, it could place
      irresistible pressures on ICANN to become a vehicle for the policy
      preferences of other world governments, each of them hostile
      to a different category of speech.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The bottom line is that if the U.S. government
      were to seek the creation of such a top- level domain as part
      of the global name space, it would be necessary to work within
      the ICANN process; it would be destructive to seek to impose
      that directive from without. Working within the ICANN process,
      I'll warn you, is difficult, slow and contentious. Further, it's
      not at all clear how ICANN would appropriately structure such
      a domain as part of a global name space. I understand that Roger
      Cochetti will be discussing some of the issues that would arise
      in that context, so I'll not linger long on them here. Since
      I am a scholar of filtering and constitutional law, though, I
      do want to discuss some of the consequences of having this sort
      of top-level domain at all.</FONT></P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT><A NAME="Consequences"></A><B><U><FONT
       FACE="Arial">Consequences</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">To the extent that particular web sites
      are located only in a particular top-level domain, the enterprise
      of filtering those sites would be trivial. We would see extensive
      new filtering, I believe, on routers and servers. That is, if
      there were a .XXX domain, I expect that a substantial number
      of Internet service providers would choose to make resources
      in that domain completely unavailable to their users. Indeed,
      a significant number of countries would do the same. This would
      be sufficiently effective, in limiting the commercial reach of
      sites located in such a domain, that I would expect relatively
      few U.S.-based sites would voluntarily move there, discontinuing
      their presence in .com. (On the other hand, some might well move
      there while maintaining an identical presence in .com.) No sites
      based outside the U.S. would discontinue their existing sites.
      The upshot is that the establishment of such a domain, without
      more, would do little to reduce access by minors to sexually
      explicit material on the World Wide Web. Any value it had in
      facilitating filtering would likely be outweighed by its disadvantages
      in providing to some minors a sure-fire way of finding sexually
      explicit materials.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The regulatory alternative would be to
      make use of the domain mandatory -- that is, to make it illegal
      for U.S.-based speakers to distribute certain categories of speech
      via the World Wide Web, except at a web site located in the particular
      top-level domain. This would raise substantial first amendment
      issues, though. As I mentioned a moment ago, a site located in
      such a domain would have vastly smaller reach &#151; a substantial
      number of ISPs would not make it available at all. While individual
      users would not have to subscribe to those ISPs, a user might
      well find that if he wanted access to a particular site, he would
      have to change ISPs in order to do so. Further, any site located
      in that domain would immediately be branded, in the public eye,
      as pornography. As a result, requiring a particular speaker to
      locate in the &quot;harmful to minors&quot; top- level domain
      would substantially interfere with his ability to get his message
      out.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">This would, in turn, raise all of the first
      amendment issues that arose in the Reno v. ACLU and COPA litigations.
      How should the class of speakers to be exiled to this domain
      be defined? Recall the Supreme Court's question in Reno v. ACLU:
      &quot;Could a speaker confidently assume that a serious discussion
      about birth control practices, homosexuality, the First Amendment
      issues raised by the Appendix to our Pacifica opinion, or the
      consequences of prison rape would not&quot; be covered by the
      statute? Speakers would have reason to fear, the Court continued,
      that a prosecutor would read the statute to extend to discussions
      about safe sexual practices or artistic images including nude
      subjects. It seems to me plain that it would be unconstitutional
      to require speakers like those to exile themselves, on pain of
      criminal prosecution, to a top-level domain from which they could
      not realistically be heard. That means, though, that such a statute
      would face the same sort of constitutional obstacles as have
      prior statutes in this area.</FONT></P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT><A NAME="Conclusion"></A><B><U><FONT
       FACE="Arial">Conclusion</FONT></U></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In sum: It would be untenable for the United
      States government simply to order the creation of a new top-level
      domain for material harmful to minors. Rather, if it wishes to
      see such a domain created, it will have to work within the ICANN
      policy process. The benefits of having such a domain, though,
      are clouded at best. If use of the domain is not made mandatory,
      its mere existence will do little to reduce access by minors
      to sexually explicit material on the World Wide Web. But any
      statute purporting to make use of the domain mandatory would
      raise serious constitutional problems.</FONT></P>
