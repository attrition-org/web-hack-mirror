      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Dear Mr. Roberts:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I am writing to express the concern of
      the Department of Commerce regarding the lack of progress by
      ICANN accredited registrars in implementing a capability that
      permits query-based Whois search functionality across all registrars.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">If electronic commerce is to reach its
      full potential, Internet consumers must have web-based access
      to complete, accurate, and up-to-date registrant contact information.
      Likewise, businesses must have confidence that their trademarks
      and other intellectual property can be protected in the online
      environment. For these reasons, the Department of Commerce has
      expressed strong support for Section II.F.4 of the ICANN Accreditation
      Agreement that requires registrars to:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">abide by any ICANN-adopted Policy that
        requires registrars to cooperatively implement a distributed
        capability that provides query-based Whois search functionality
        across all registrars.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">To date, ICANN's Registrar Constituency
      has not proposed such a policy. Technology exists to enable this
      distributed capability across registrars -- and, indeed, across
      registries &#150; and we are aware that at least one such service
      is under development and has been made available to registrars
      free of charge. Moreover, Section II.F.4 of the Accreditation
      Agreement is intended to minimize delays in the adoption of a
      consensus policy by further providing:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">If the Whois service implemented by registrars
        does not in a reasonable time provide reasonably robust, reliable,
        and convenient access to accurate and up-to-date data, the Registrar
        shall abide by any ICANN-adopted Policy requiring Registrar,
        if reasonably determined by ICANN to be necessary (considering
        such possibilities as remedial action by specific registrars),
        to supply data from Registrar's database to facilitate the development
        of a centralized Whois database for the purpose of providing
        comprehensive Registrar Whois search capability.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">We urge the ICANN Board to consider whether
      the registrars have had a reasonable time period in which to
      act. If the Board concludes, as we have, that the time for action
      has come and gone, it is incumbent on the Board to move this
      process forward by, as appropriate, (1) imposing an early deadline
      for cooperative implementation of this requirement by registrars,
      (2) insisting that registrars work to further the development
      available or proposed approaches, or (3) requiring registrars
      to supply data to facilitate the development of a centralized
      Whois database.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I would be happy to discuss our concerns
      in greater detail with ICANN staff and/or members of its Board
      of Directors.<BR>
<BR>
      Sincerely,</FONT></P>
