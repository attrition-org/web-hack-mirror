      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Donald Telage<BR>
      Chairman <BR>
      Child Online Protection Act Commission<BR>
      c/o Kristin Litterst<BR>
      Dittus Communications<BR>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Dear Chairman Telage:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I appreciate the Commission's invitation
      to provide information concerning the process for introduction
      of new top-level domains (TLDs) to the domain name system (DNS)
      of the Internet.  Unfortunately, preparation for the upcoming
      Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) meeting
      in Yokohama prevents me from attending these hearings in person.
       I hope this letter will meet the Commission's needs. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN does not express a position on the
      advisability of adding a new TLD specifically for adult material.
       Rather, in this letter it seeks to describe the ongoing process
      of consideration of the addition of new TLDs generally.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN is the non-profit corporation that
      was formed in 1998 by the Internet community at the invitation
      of the U.S. Government's White Paper.  ICANN and the U.S. Department
      of Commerce are engaged in a joint project under which the U.S.
      Government is, as described in the White Paper, transitioning
      responsibility for the IP address space allocation, protocol
      parameter assignment, domain name system management, and root
      server system management functions to the private sector.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In keeping with the history of the management
      of the Internet, ICANN uses a bottom-up, consensus-based decision-making
      process.  ICANN is advised by three supporting organizations-the
      Address Support Organization, the Domain Name Support Organization,
      and the Protocol Support Organization-comprised of experts and
      interested participants who examine in-depth the issues facing
      ICANN and make recommendations to the ICANN Board.  ICANN and
      its Supporting Organizations operate to the greatest extent feasible
      in open and transparent manner. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">For several years, there have been proposals
      to implement additional TLDs in the DNS.  Different types of
      TLDs have been discussed, ranging from TLDs available for registrations
      by any person or organization for any use (&quot;unrestricted
      TLDs&quot;) to TLDs intended for registration by particular types
      of persons or organizations or for particular uses (&quot;restricted
      TLDs&quot;).  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In accordance with the bottom-up principle
      of the White Paper, in May 1999 the ICANN Board referred the
      issue of TLD expansion to its Domain Name Support Organization
      (DNSO).  On June 25, 1999 the DNSO Names Council created a group,
      known as Working Group C, to study the issues raised by the introduction
      of new TLDs.  Working Group C deliberated for approximately nine
      months and in March and April of this year submitted reports
      to the Names Council.   On April 18, 2000, the Names Council
      adopted a set of recommendations to the ICANN Board.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Those recommendations, which are currently
      before the ICANN Board, call for the addition of a limited number
      of new top-level domains (TLDs).  The Board is expected to act
      on these recommendations at its meeting in Yokohama, Japan on
      July 16, 2000.    </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Consistent with the recommendations of
      Working Group C, the Names Council stressed that the introduction
      of new TLDs should occur in a &quot;measured and responsible
      manner,&quot; as part of an initial test bed designed to enable
      effective evaluation of the process.  The Names Council expressed
      concern that a proposal to introduce initially as many as ten
      new TLDs did not enjoy consensus in the Internet community. 
      The proposed limitation on the number of new TLDs to be initially
      introduced reflects concern about potential dangers to the stability
      of the Internet if many TLDs are added too quickly.  Additionally,
      because no new generic TLD has been added for many years (since
      before the emergence of widespread commercial uses of the Internet),
      lack of experience in the practical implications of adding of
      new TLDs counsels caution.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Many groups, companies, and organizations
      have expressed needs and desires for new TLDs, ranging from open
      TLDs to promote competition with .com, to specialized non-commercial
      domains to promote advocacy and free-speech values, to a personal
      domain in which individuals may register their proper names.
       If the Board proceeds with the addition of new TLDs at its meeting
      on July 16, it is likely to call for proposals from organizations
      that wish to sponsor new TLDs and companies that wish to operate
      TLD registries.  ICANN would then evaluate the proposals and
      select a small number of TLDs from among them according to policies
      adopted in the Internet community through the ICANN process.
       The Names Council's recommendations contemplate that, after
      introduction of this initial round of new TLDs, there will be
      a review of the experience gained to determine whether additional
      TLDs should be introduced.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Please let me know if you would like me
      to provide additional information on the process for introduction
      of new TLDs.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Sincerely, </FONT></P>
