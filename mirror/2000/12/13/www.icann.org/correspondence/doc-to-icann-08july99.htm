  <DT>Ms. Esther Dyson, Interim Chairman of the Board 
  <DT>Mr. Michael Roberts, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer 
  <DT>Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) 
  <DT>4676 Admiralty Way, Suite 330 
  <DT>Marina Del Rey, CA 90292 </DT>
</DL>
<P>Dear Esther and Michael:</P>
<P>Thank you very much for your report outlining the tremendous progress that 
  has been made in the six months since the United States Department of Commerce 
  officially recognized ICANN as the global, non-profit consensus organization 
  envisioned in our White Paper issued in June 1998.</P>
<P>The many achievements you have made since last November are especially noteworthy 
  in light of the challenge presented in creating a world-wide, non-profit, private 
  consensus organization consistent with the core principles of stability, competition, 
  private sector, bottom-up coordination and geographic representation inherent 
  to the Internet. We appreciate the concrete examples of the steps you have taken 
  toward our shared goal of transitioning technical management of the domain name 
  system, after years of direct government involvement, to private sector hands.</P>
<P>In carefully reviewing your report, and the considerable progress made toward 
  establishing the structures for representative decision making contemplated 
  in the White paper, there is still important work to be done:</P>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <P> 
    <li>ICANN's top priority must be to complete the work necessary to put in 
      place an elected Board of Directors on a timely basis. Specifically, ICANN 
      must do everything within its power to establish the Supporting Organizations, 
      and ensure the election of nine board members by those Organizations to 
      begin serving at the November 1999 Board Meeting. The process of electing 
      At-Large Directors should be complete by June 2000.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <P> 
    <li>ICANN should eliminate the $1 per-year, per-domain name registration user 
      fee. Although the user fee may be determined to be an appropriate method 
      for funding ICANN's activities, it is controversial. We believe a permanent 
      financing method should not be adopted until after the nine elected members 
      are added to the ICANN Board in November. By taking such a step, ICANN will 
      ensure that this important decision is made in accordance with the representative, 
      bottom-up process that is essential for ICANN to carry out its mission. 
      In the meanwhile, we will work with ICANN and the entire Internet community, 
      to the extent permitted by law, to obtain interim resources for ICANN.</li>
  </ul>
  <P> 
  <ul>
    <li>ICANN should immediately open its Board Meetings to the public. Transparency 
      is critical to establishing trust in decision making. And trust is essential 
      for ICANN's ultimate success. As a general matter, ICANN has undertaken 
      the vast majority of its work in an open and transparent manner. The final 
      step of opening the Board Meetings is critical to establishing trust in 
      ICANN.</li>
  </ul>
  <P> 
  <ul>
    <li>There is concern in the Internet community about the possibility of over-regulation. 
      Therefore, ICANN should assure all registrars and registries through its 
      contractual relations that it will restrict its policy development activities 
      to matters that are reasonably necessary to achieve the goals specified 
      in the White Paper and that it will act in accordance with the procedural 
      principles set forth in the White Paper. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<P>As your report makes clear, the process of establishing ICANN has understandably 
  been a difficult and contentious one from the beginning. It is therefore incumbent 
  on all of us engaged in this process, both in our public and private actions, 
  to take steps to ensure that, both in substance and in tone, we set an example 
  for accuracy, civility, and respect. We understand that in this environment, 
  it is not always easy to be consistent in this regard, but it is essential to 
  achieving our shared goal.</P>
<P>On behalf of the Department, let me thank you, again, for your report. It is 
  a credit to you both, the Board of Directors and staff of ICANN, and the entire 
  Internet community that we have made such tremendous progress in the past six 
  months. With these actions, and the other steps already taken by ICANN, we believe 
  that ICANN will put itself on a very firm footing to achieve the goals and principles 
  spelled out in the White Paper.</P>
<P>Sincerely,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>J. Beckwith Burr<br>
