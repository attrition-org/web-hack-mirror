  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We noticed the following 
    notice in the Commerce Business Daily. Would you please clarify ICANN's understanding 
    of these relationships? What is the relationship between the IETF and ICANN 
    in general? What is the relationship between the IETF and the specific functions 
    which the IANA has been providing in conjunction with the assignment of protocol 
    parameters for IETF developed or maintained protocols? </font></p>

      contractor will perform the following IANA functions: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;1) Coordination of the 
      assignment of technical protocol parameters. This currently involves the 
      review and assignment of unique values to numerous parameters (e.g., operation 
      codes, port numbers, object identifiers, protocol numbers) used in various 
      Internet protocols. This function also currently includes the dissemination 
      of the listings of assigned parameters through various means (including 
      on-line publication) and the review of technical documents for consistency 
      with assigned values.&quot;</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Scott, Brian and Fred, </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you for your letter inquiring 
    as to ICANN's understanding of the relationships between the IETF, ICANN and 
    the IANA's protocol parameter support activities. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are navigating uncharted waters 
    and are proceeding carefully to try to do the right thing for the Internet 
    community while following the principles and policies set out in the government's 
    White Paper. One of the several responsibilities that the White Paper charges 
    ICANN to carry out is "to coordinate the assignment of other Internet technical 
    parameters as needed to maintain universal connectivity on the Internet." 
    We do not understand this to mean the actual assignment of protocol parameters 
    (which we would do only if some standards organization requests us to do so), 
    but rather the development of policies and procedures to be used by organizations 
    developing standards for the Internet to resolve disputes that may arise over 
    specific protocol assignments. In particular we would expect that these policies 
    and procedures will be designed to be used where a dispute is one in which 
    the activity of one standards organization blocks the deployment of a technology 
    from a second standards organization. It seems to us that, in the ordinary 
    course of things, the initial development of such policies and procedures 
    would logically fall within the scope of a Protocol Supporting Organization, 
    which would then forward recommendations to the ICANN Board for its review. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the Postel era and currently, 
    protocol parameter assignments have been routinely performed by IANA staff 
    in coordination with the IETF. As you know, many of the people who were the 
    IANA staff are now working for ICANN, and the IANA functions are in the process 
    of being formally transferred to ICANN by the United States Government. We 
    assume that the IETF will continue to have the discretion to decide where 
    it would like this particular function performed in the future, and the IANA/ICANN 
    staff are prepared to continue to perform these services if the IETF so requests. 
    I hope this clarifies our view as to the respective roles of ICANN, IANA and 
    the IETF in this area. We look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure 
    the operational stability of the Internet. </font></p>
