  <p align="left">Mr. Donald Telage<br>
    Network Solutions, Inc. </p>
  <p align="left">Dear Don, </p>
  <p align="left">Your message of today, copied in part below, is not responsive 
    to the May 27 resolution of the ICANN Board with respect to participation 
    of the gTLD constituency in the provisional DNSO Names Council. </p>
  <p align="left">In order to participate in the Names Council, Network Solutions 
    must name a single representative as directed by the May 27th resolution. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">The Board appreciates your concern for representation of a full 
    range of interests in the work of the DNSO. The Board has considered and discussed 
    this objective both at its Singapore and at its Berlin meetings and in the 
    public fora associated with those meetings. It took particular note of the 
    needs of individual domain name holders for representation in its At Large 
    and Supporting Organization constituencies and indicated in its actions in 
    Berlin that it will incorporate the views of these constituencies in its further 
    actions in forming these constituencies and their representation structures. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">However, it is not the role of the gTLD constituency, or of 
    Network Solutions, to deal with these issues. There are appropriate public 
    consensus mechanisms provided in the ICANN Bylaws and in our noticed actions 
    in this area for accomplishing that objective. </p>
  <p align="left">I look forward to hearing from you at an early date that you 
    have reconsidered your actions presented to us today and are prepared to participate 
    in the provisional Names Council in the manner adopted by the Board. </p>
  <p align="left">Sincerely, </p>
  <p align="left">- Mike </p>
