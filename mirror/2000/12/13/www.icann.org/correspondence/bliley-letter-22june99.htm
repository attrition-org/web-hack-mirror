  <p align="left">Ms. Esther Dyson<br>
    Interim Chairman<br>
    Internet Corporation For Assigned Names and Numbers<br>
    4676 Admiralty Way, Suite 330<br>
    Marina del Rey, CA 90292 </p>
  <p align="left">Dear Ms. Dyson: </p>
  <p align="left">I am writing to express my concern about recent steps taken 
    by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") as part 
    of its role in the transition to privatize management of the Internet's Domain 
    Name System ("DNS"). </p>
  <p align="left">The Committee has been following closely the evolution of the 
    DNS and has supported the efforts to privatize the management of this essential 
    element of the Internet. I welcomed the call in the Department of Commerce's 
    White Paper to create a new corporation "governed on the basis of a sound 
    and transparent decision making-process, which protects against capture by 
    a self-interested faction." Additionally, since the Department of Commerce's 
    entry into its Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") with ICANN in November 
    1998, Committee staff has met regularly with officers of ICANN and other interested 
    parties to discuss the ongoing activities associated with the transfer of 
    the DNS from the public sector to the private sector. </p>
  <p align="left">As you may recall, in October of last year I wrote Secretary 
    of Commerce William M. Daley and Ira Magaziner, then Senior Advisor to the 
    President for Policy Development, requesting information about their knowledge 
    of the selection of ICANN's interim board members. Now, as ICANN's interim 
    board begins to undertake formation of policy that will have far-reaching 
    consequences for Internet users, domain name holders and companies offering 
    domain name registration services, I remain troubled about the manner in which 
    the interim board members were selected, and have new questions about the 
    manner in which the interim board is operating. </p>
  <p align="left">I also am greatly concerned about the interim board's imposition 
    of a $1 per domain name registration fee, the funding of a rather large ($5.9 
    million) ICANN budget through such a fee, and the setting of highly regulatory 
    accreditation requirements for those who wish to offer domain name registration 
    services. Such decisions likely exceed the authority that the White Paper 
    originally contemplated for the private organization whose role ICANN now 
    is attempting to fulfill. Rather than promote the Internet's evolution, your 
    organization's policies actually may jeopardize the continued stability of 
    the underlying systems that permit millions of people to use, enjoy and transact 
    business on the Internet. </p>
  <p align="left">Moreover, I understand that during the most recent ICANN board 
    meeting in Berlin last month, the interim board reportedly threatened to terminate 
    the authority of the incumbent domain name registrar - Network Solutions, 
    Incorporated ("NSI") - to continue registering domain names if NSI fails to 
    enter into a registrar accreditation agreement with ICANN by June 25, 1999. 
    What makes this situation more distressing is the simple fact that these steps 
    are being decided upon and implemented by an unelected board that conducts 
    portions of its official meetings in private. In this light, I do not believe 
    the process followed by ICANN's interim board during its recent work toward 
    the privatization of the DNS has been sufficiently transparent. </p>
  <p align="left">The governance model being formed for the management of the 
    DNS likely will set the precedent for future efforts to establish a governance 
    structure in other critical areas of the Internet. Consequently, it is vitally 
    important, not only for the future stability of the DNS, but for all future 
    Internet governance efforts, that the procedures for the establishment of 
    governance be fully transparent, democratic and open. </p>
  <p align="left">Therefore, in order to assist the Committee in its review of 
    the present state of the transition of the Internet DNS from the public sector 
    to the private sector, as well as to satisfy unanswered questions regarding 
    the selection of the interim board's members, I would like to learn more about 
    ICANN's origin, decisions and operational authority. Accordingly, pursuant 
    to Rules X and XI of the U.S. House of Representatives, I request that ICANN 
    provide the following information to the Committee by July 6, 1999: </p>
  <p align="left">1. Please answer the following:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left">a. Before imposing a $1 per domain name registration fee, 
    did ICANN conduct, or have conducted on its behalf, a legal analysis of its 
    authority to impose such a fee? If ICANN did conduct such a legal analysis, 
    please provide all records related to the aforementioned legal analysis. If 
    ICANN has not conducted such a legal analysis, please provide a detailed legal 
    analysis of the source and limits of ICANN's authority to impose a $1 per 
    domain name registration fee.</div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>b. Has ICANN conducted, or had conducted on its behalf, a legal analysis 
      of its authority to terminate NSI's authority to register domain names? 
      If ICANN has conducted such a legal analysis, please provide all records 
      related to the aforementioned legal analysis. If ICANN has not conducted 
      such a legal analysis, please provide a detailed legal analysis of the source 
      and limits of ICANN's authority to terminate NSI's authority to register 
      domain names. </p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">c. Has ICANN conducted, or had conducted on its behalf, a 
    legal analysis of its authority to retain intellectual property rights over 
    registrar data? If ICANN has conducted such a legal analysis, please provide 
    all records related to the aforementioned legal analysis. If ICANN has not 
    conducted such a legal analysis, please provide a detailed legal analysis 
    of the source and limits of ICANN's authority to retain intellectual property 
    rights over registrar data. </div>
  <div align="center"> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">d. Are any ICANN interim board members compensated by ICANN? 
      For every interim board member who is compensated, please identify the interim 
      board member in question and indicate the amount of compensation. </p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">e. Regarding ICANN's "Transition Budget for Fiscal Year 1999-2000": 
  </div>
  <blockquote> 
    <div align="left"> 
      <p>i. Who drafted this budget?</p>
      <p>ii. How did ICANN arrive at funding levels in this budget? Please provide 
        an explanation of the underlying rationales that served as the basis for 
        the budget's funding levels. </p>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>f. What are the circumstances under which ICANN's interim board will be 
      replaced by an elected board? Please provide a reasonable estimate of when 
      it is anticipated that this event will take place. </p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div align="left"> 
  <p>2. A detailed explanation of ICANN's decision to deny the general public 
    access to portions of its meetings and the meetings of its supporting organizations. 
  </p>
  <p>3. A detailed explanation of ICANN's decision to seek authority solely over 
    generic Top Level Domains ("TLDs"), and not over country code TLDs, many of 
    which are commercial in nature and accept registration by all individuals. 
  </p>
  <p>4. A detailed summary from each ICANN interim board member recounting the 
    sequence of events that preceded the person's acceptance of membership on 
    ICANN's interim board. This summary should include, but is not limited to, 
    answers to the following questions: </p>

      the aforementioned invitation? </p>
    <p>d. Please provide all records related to the consideration and selection 
      of each interim board member. </p>

      not limited to the imposition of the $1 per domain name registration fee; 
    </p>
    <p>d. Termination or alteration of the Department of Commerce's cooperative 
      agreement with NSI; and </p>
    <p>e. Attempts to persuade or force NSI into entering a registrar accreditation 
      agreement with ICANN, or NSI's refusal to enter into the aforementioned
