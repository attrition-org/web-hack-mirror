<P>SUMMARY</P>
<P>The Internet, to remain a global network, technically requires the existence 
  of a globally unique public name space. The DNS name space is a hierarchical 
  name space derived from a single, globally unique root. This is inherent in 
  the design of the DNS system. Therefore it is not technically meaningful for 
  there to be more than one root in the public DNS system. That one root must 
  be supported by a small number of coordinated root servers, and administered 
  by a unique naming authority. </P>
<P>Put simply, allowing multiple public DNS roots would raise a very strong possibility 
  that users of different ISPs who click on the same link on a web page could 
  end up at different destinations, against the will of the web page designers.</P>
<P>This does not preclude private networks from operating their own private name 
  spaces, but if they wish to make use of names uniquely defined for the global 
  Internet, they have to fetch that information from the global DNS naming hierarchy, 
  and in particular from the coordinated root servers of the global DNS naming 
  hierarchy.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>DETAILED EXPLANATION</P>
<P> </P>
<P>There are two reasons for a single DNS root:</P>
<P> </P>
<P>1. For any communications between two parties to be effective there are two 
  essential preconditions: The existence of a common symbol set, and the existence 
  of a common semantic interpretation of these symbols. Failure of the first condition 
  implies a failure to communicate at all, and failure of the second implies that 
  the meaning of the communication is lost. </P>
<P>In the case of a public communications system this condition of a common symbol 
  set with a common semantic interpretation must be further strengthened to that 
  of a unique symbol set with a unique semantic interpretation. This condition 
  of uniqueness allows any party to initiate a communication that can be received 
  and understood by any other party. Such a condition rules out the ability to 
  define a symbol within some bounded context. In such a case, once the communication 
  moves out of the context of interpretation in which it was defined, the meaning 
  of the symbol becomes lost.</P>
<P>Within public digital communications networks such as the Internet this requirement 
  for a uniquely defined symbol set with a uniquely defined meaning exists at 
  many levels, commencing with the binary encoding scheme, extending to packet 
  headers and payload formats and the protocol that an application uses to interact. 
  In each case a variation of the symbol set or a difference of interpretation 
  of the symbols being used within the interaction causes a protocol failure, 
  and the communication fails. The property of uniqueness allows a symbol to be 
  used unambiguously in any context, allowing the symbol to be passed on, referred 
  to, and reused, while still preserving the meaning of the original use. </P>
<P>The DNS fulfils an essential role within the Internet protocol environment, 
  allowing network locations to be referred to using a label other than a protocol 
  address. As with any other such symbol set, DNS names are designed to be globally 
  unique, that is, for any one DNS name at any one time there must be a single 
  set of DNS records uniquely describing protocol addresses, network resources 
  and services associated with that DNS name. All of the applications deployed 
  on the Internet which use DNS assume this, and Internet users expect such behavior 
  from DNS names. Names are then constant symbols, whose interpretation does not 
  specifically require knowledge of the context of any individual party. A DNS 
  name can be passed from one party to another without altering the semantic intent 
  of the name. </P>
<P>Since the DNS is hierarchically structured into domains, the uniqueness requirement 
  for DNS names in their entirety implies that each of the names (sub-domains) 
  defined within a domain has a unique meaning (i.e. set of DNS records) within 
  that domain. This is as true for the root domain as for any other DNS domain. 
  The requirement for uniqueness within a domain further implies that there be 
  some mechanism to prevent name conflicts within a domain. In DNS this is accomplished 
  by assigning a single owner or maintainer to every domain, including the root 
  domain, who is responsible for ensuring that each sub-domain of that domain 
  has the proper records associated with it. This is a technical requirement, 
  not a policy choice.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>2. Both the design and implementations of the DNS protocol are heavily based 
  on the assumption that there is a single owner or maintainer for every domain, 
  and that any set of resources records associated with a domain is modified in 
  a single-copy serializable fashion. That is, even assuming that a single domain 
  could somehow be "shared" by uncooperating parties, there is no means within 
  the DNS protocol by which a user or client could discover, and choose between, 
  conflicting definitions of a DNS name made by different parties. The client 
  will simply return the first set of resource records that it finds that matches 
  the requested domain, and assume that these are valid. This protocol is embedded 
  in the operating software of hundreds of millions of computer systems, and is 
  not easily updated to support a shared domain scenario. Morever, even supposing 
  that some other means of resolving conflicting definitions could be provided 
  in the future, it would have to be based on objective rules established in advance. 
  (For example, zone A.B could declare that naming authority Y had been delegated 
  all subdomains of A.B with an odd number of characters, and that naming authority 
  Z had been delegated authority to define subdomains of A.B with an even number 
  of characters.) Thus, a single set of rules would have to be agreed to prevent 
  Y and Z from making conflicting assignments, and with this train of actions 
  a single unique space has been created in any case. Of course this would not 
  allow multiple non-cooperating authorities to assign arbitrary sub-domains within 
  a single domain; it seems that a degree of cooperation and agreed technical 
  rules are required in order to guarantee the uniqueness of names. In the DNS, 
  these rules are established independently for each part of the naming hierarchy, 
  and the root domain is no exception. Thus, there must be a generally agreed 
  single set of rules for the root.</P>
<P>A PRACTICAL NOTE</P>
<P>There is one specific technical respect in which the root zone is different 
  from all other DNS zones: the addresses of the name servers for the root zone 
  come primarily from out-of-band information (named.root files from the ISC BIND 
  distribution, your ISP, whatever) rather than via the NS RR delegation chain. 
  NS RRs for the root zone, while present, are almost irrelevant. In effect, every 
  full-service resolver in the world "delegates" the root of the public tree to 
  the public root server(s) of its choice. </P>
<P>As a direct consequence, any change to the list of IP addresses that specify 
  the public root zone is significantly more difficult than changing any other 
  aspect of the DNS delegation chain. Thus, stability of the system calls for 
  extremely conservative and cautious management of the public root zone (low 
  churn rate, relatively tight update coupling between the servers, etc), because 
  it's very difficult to route around a misbehaving root server.</P>
<P>CONCLUSION</P>
<P>The DNS type of unique naming and name-mapping system may not be ideal for 
  a number of purposes for which it was never designed, such a locating information 
  when the user doesn't precisely know the correct names. As the Internet continues 
  to expand, we would expect directory systems to evolve which can assist the 
  user in dealing with vague or ambiguous references. To preserve the many important 
  features of the DNS and its multiple record types --including the Internet's 
  equivalent of number portability-- we would expect the result of directory lookups 
  and identification of the correct names for a particular purpose to be unique 
  DNS names that are then resolved normally, rather than having directory systems 
  'replace' the DNS. There is no getting away from the unique root of the public 
  DNS.</P>
