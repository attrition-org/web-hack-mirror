            Mr. Mike Roberts<BR>
            CEO and President ICANN<BR>

<BR>
      Dear Mr. Roberts,<BR>
<BR>
      I would like to thank you for your recent visit to Brussels and
      for the exchange of information that took place with the Commission
      services on that occasion.<BR>
<BR>
      During your visit you were again informed about the strong interest
      in Europe for the creation of the new Internet Top Level Domain,
      .EU</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The European Commission has thoroughly
      studied this initiative with the European institutions, ISPs,
      industry and the local Internet community in Europe. Earlier
      this year we conducted a broad and open public consultation on
      the proposal, based on a consultation document that has been
      posted on the web. That consultation confirmed widespread support
      from major Internet interests in this proposal. Moreover, the
      setting up of the .EU Domain is now part of the eEurope Action
      Plan, endorsed at the recent Feira European Council and thus
      endorsed at the level of the Heads of State/Government of the
      15 EU Member States.<BR>
<BR>
      Last year the Commission also asked the ISO 3166 Maintenance
      Agency to agree to using the reserved EU code for an Internet
      TLD. ISO has agreed to our request and has decided to extend
      the scope of the reservation of the code element EU to cover
      any application of ISO 3166-1 that needs a coded representation
      of the name European Union, including its being used as an Internet
      Top Level Domain. Therefore, we hereby request that the .EU Domain
      should be delegated to the European Union by ICANN.<BR>
<BR>
      On our part, I am glad to inform you that the Commission has
      encouraged the Internet community in Europe to undertake preparatory
      work for the creation of an appropriate Registry organisation.
      This Registry should be operated in a similar manner to the existing
      country code registries at the European level, particularly regarding
      its relationship with the relevant public authority, in this
      case the European Union.<BR>
<BR>
      It is also our intention to ensure that the new Registry would
      conform to the rules and best-practices established by ICANN,
      as appropriate, and that the Registry would take full account
      of the guidelines for the operation of such registries recently
      adopted by the ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I would be grateful if you could inform
      the Board of ICANN and its Staff of our intention that the Domain
      .EU would be introduced into the Domain Name System before the
      end of the year. If you feel it necessary, we could provide further
      explanation for the ICANN Board meeting to be held in Yokohama
      mid-July.<BR>
<BR>
      Meanwhile, please do not hesitate to contact the Directorate
      General Information Society (either Mr.C.Wilkinson, member of
      the GAC, or Mr.Paul Verhoef, Head of Unit ff International Affairs)
      should you or the ICANN Staff have any question in this regard.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Yours sincerely,<BR>
<BR>
