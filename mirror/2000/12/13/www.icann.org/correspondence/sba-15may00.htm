<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial">May 15, 2000 </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Mr. Jere Glover, Chief Counsel for Advocacy <br>
    Mr. Eric Menge, Asst. Chief Counsel for Telecommunications <br>
    Office of Advocacy <br>
    U. S. Small Business Administration <br>
    Washington, DC 20416 </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Dear Mr. Glover and Mr. Menge, </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">I am responding to <a href="http://www.sba.gov/advo/laws/comments/icann99_1027.html">your 
    letter to Ms. Esther Dyson of October 27, 1999</a> and your subsequent presentation 
    at the public forum session of the ICANN Annual Meeting in November. The Board 
    welcomes the suggestions you have made and hopes you will excuse this delayed 
    response. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">In your detailed communications to us, your primary recommendation 
    was that ICANN "open a proceeding" to establish various rules of procedure 
    for its policy-development activities and suggested that those rules should 
    be patterned on the United States Administrative Procedure Act. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The ICANN Board and staff take seriously their obligation 
    to operate in as open and transparent a manner as possible. Our Bylaws, themselves 
    the product of an open drafting process, contain exceptionally detailed guidance 
    to the Board on matters affecting openness, transparency, and redress. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">During the course of the last eighteen months, we have 
    learned much about creating consultative processes to support the requirements 
    of the Bylaws and the needs of our constituents. There are obviously a number 
    of difficult tradeoffs to be made between ensuring the maximum access to ICANN 
    consensus processes for the maximum number of people while at the same time 
    being responsive to the needs of the Internet community for effective private-sector 
    technical coordination of the Domain Name System, which is what ICANNN is 
    all about. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">With regard to specifics, it seems useful to take note 
    of the section of the U.S. Government's White Paper dealing with the nature 
    of the new entity that it intended should take responsibility for the technical 
    coordination of the DNS. The complete document may be accessed at:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm</a>. 
    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial">"4. Creation of the New Corporation and Management of 
      the DNS. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The Green Paper called for the creation of a new private, 
      not-for-profit corporation (17) responsible for coordinating specific DNS 
      functions for the benefit of the Internet as a whole. Under the Green Paper 
      proposal, the U.S. Government(18) would gradually transfer these functions 
      to the new corporation beginning as soon as possible, with the goal of having 
      the new corporation carry out operational responsibility by October 1998. 
      Under the Green Paper proposal, the U.S. Government would continue to participate 
      in policy oversight until such time as the new corporation was established 
      and stable, phasing out as soon as possible, but in no event later than 
      September 30, 2000. The Green Paper suggested that the new corporation be 
      incorporated in the United States in order to promote stability and facilitate 
      the continued reliance on technical expertise residing in the United States, 
      including IANA staff at USC/ISI. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Comments: Almost all commenters supported the creation 
      of a new, private not-for-profit corporation to manage DNS. Many suggested 
      that IANA should evolve into the new corporation. A small number of commenters 
      asserted that the U.S. Government should continue to manage Internet names 
      and addresses. Another small number of commenters suggested that DNS should 
      be managed by international governmental institutions such as the United 
      Nations or the International Telecommunications Union. Many commenters urged 
      the U.S. Government to commit to a more aggressive timeline for the new 
      corporation's assumption of management responsibility. Some commenters also 
      suggested that the proposal to headquarter the new corporation in the United 
      States represented an inappropriate attempt to impose U.S. law on the Internet 
      as a whole. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Response: The U.S. Government is committed to a transition 
      that will allow the private sector to take leadership for DNS management. 
      Most commenters shared this goal. While international organizations may 
      provide specific expertise or act as advisors to the new corporation, the 
      U.S. continues to believe, as do most commenters, that neither national 
      governments acting as sovereigns nor intergovernmental organizations acting 
      as representatives of governments should participate in management of Internet 
      names and addresses. Of course, national governments now have, and will 
      continue to have, authority to manage or establish policy for their own 
      ccTLDs." </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">The structure of ICANN, the entity subsequently recognized 
    by the Department of Commerce as fulfilling the requirements of the White 
    Paper, embodies the concept of "private-sector leadership" and attains this 
    goal through the organizational means of a tax-exempt, non-profit California 
    public benefit corporation that encourages extensive bottom-up participation 
    by its stakeholders in the crafting of new or revised coordination policies. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Given this structure, which we believe is supportive of 
    the goals of the White Paper, it would not be appropriate, in our opinion, 
    for ICANN to adopt or observe federal agency rules of procedure. Those procedures, 
    which are based on a notice-and-comment model of regulatory decision making, 
    do not offer the environment of community participation in deliberative discussions 
    that characterize most aspects of the ICANN process. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">ICANN needs to stand or fail on its ability to fulfill 
    its assigned DNS mission through private-sector consensus means, not through 
    adoption of governmental policies and procedures, no matter how well intentioned. 
    It is our belief that the desired attributes of openness and transparency 
    in our processes are at least as available to us using private-sector means 
    as they would be if the U.S. Government had chosen a federal agency to undertake 
    DNS technical management. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Again, let me express our appreciation for your interest 
    in ICANN. We look forward to your continued participation in our work. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Sincerely, </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Michael M. Roberts <br>
    President and Chief Executive Officer </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">cc: Members of the ICANN Board <br>
    Ms. J. Beckwith Burr, NTIA </font></p>
