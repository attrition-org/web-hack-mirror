  <p align="left">July 9, 1999 </p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Jim Rutt <br>
    Chief Executive Officer <br>
    Network Solutions, Inc. <br>
    505 Huntmar Park Drive <br>
    Herndon, Virginia 20170 </p>
  <p align="left">Dear Jim, </p>
  <p align="left">Thanks for stepping into the current controversy concerning 
    representation on the DNSO Names Council from the gTLD constituency. You can 
    appreciate, given my prior correspondence with Don Telage, that ICANN is attempting 
    to reach and maintain a position of fairness to all the parties concerned 
    in this matter. </p>
  <p align="left">As NSI's representatives at the Berlin ICANN meetings have surely 
    informed you, there appeared to be a near-unanimous sentiment expressed at 
    the public ICANN meeting on May 26 that no one company should be able to place 
    more than one representative on the Names Council. The peculiar situation 
    of the gTLD Constituency Group -- at the moment, NSI is the only member -- 
    means that, absent compliance with the Board's request, a single company would 
    select one-seventh of the members of the Names Council. It seemed clear in 
    Berlin that the community consensus, with which I and the Board agree, was 
    that no one company should have that level of influence in a body that is 
    designed to be broadly representative of the various worldwide communities 
    of interest that constitute the DNSO. </p>
  <p align="left">Your letter of last week, which nominates an employee plus two 
    of your lawyers to the Names Council, is not consistent with the views of 
    the community. Since this is the second letter from Network Solutions which 
    does not accept the consensus view, the ICANN Board must now do what it is 
    supposed to do: follow the community consensus. In this case that means to 
    proceed with its stated intention to amend the pertinent portions of the Bylaws 
    in the absence of your voluntary agreement to limit your representation to 
    one member. </p>
  <p align="left">In the next few days, we will post the following proposed amendment 
    to the ICANN Bylaws for public comment in accordance with our normal procedures: 
  </p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left">
    <p>RESOLVED, that Section 2(a) of Article VI-B of the Bylaws of the Corporation 
      is hereby replaced in its entirety with the following: </p>
    <p>"The NC shall consist of representatives, selected in accordance with Section 
      3(c) of this Article, from each Constituency recognized by the Board pursuant 
      to the criteria set forth in Section 3 of this Article. Any dispute about 
      whether any such representative is a proper member of the NC shall be resolved 
      by, or at the direction of, the Board." </p>
    <p>FURTHER RESOLVED, that Section 3(c) of Article VI-B of the Bylaws of the 
      Corporation is hereby replaced in its entirety with the following: </p>
    <p>"Each Constituency shall select up to three individuals to represent that 
      Constituency on the NC, no two of which may be, except with the consent 
      of the Board, residents of the same Geographic Region, as defined in Article 
      V, Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Constituency may have more 
      representatives on the NC than there are members of the Constituency. Nominations 
      within each Constituency may be made by any member of the Constituency, 
      but no such member may make more than one nomination in any single Constituency." 
    </p>
    <p>FURTHER RESOLVED, that Section 2(f) of Article VI-B of the Bylaws of the 
      Corporation is hereby replaced in its entirety with the following: </p>
    <p>"Unless shorterned by the Board in its recognition of a Constituency, the 
      term of office for each member of the NC shall be two years, subject to 
      earlier removal by the Constituency that selected such member or by a three-fourths 
      majority vote of all members of the Board." </p>
  </div>
</blockquote>

  <p align="left">The other members of the ICANN Board and I do not believe that 
    amending our Bylaws to eliminate avenues for the pursuit of special interest 
    objectives is a useful exercise. All of us have more important things to do. 
    As a new player, and one committed to making the system work for everyone 
    by your recent public statement, it would be a valuable contribution to making 
    the DNSO successful if you accepted the consensus view and voluntarily agreed 
    to name only one member to the Names Council. </p>
