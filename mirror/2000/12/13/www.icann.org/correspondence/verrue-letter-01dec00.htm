      codes in the new gTLDs</U></FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Dear Mr. Roberts,</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Further to the decision by the ICANN Board
      on Thursday 16 November 2000 to authorise the creation of seven
      new Top Level Domains and the GAC Opinion of the same date regarding
      new gTLDs, this is to draw your attention to the position of
      the EU regarding the possible use of existing ISO alpha-2 and
      alpha-3 codes as second or third level domains in the new TLDs.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In general, we are glad to confirm that
      we adhere to the GAC advice to ICANN contained in its 16 November
      Opinion, and that we attach particular importance to the request
      for a published registration policy for each of the new TLDs,
      ratified by ICANN after appropriate consultation with the relevant
      constituencies. To this effect, we would be glad if you would
      draw the new Registries' attention to this letter as well as
      to the GAC Opinion.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">New gTLDs should not create confusion for
      internet users and in particular new gTLDs should not be significantly
      similar to a ccTLD so as to be confusing. Where a gTLD proposes
      to include an ISO alpha-2 or alpha-3 letter code, it may be appropriate
      to get agreement from the relevant authority or region for its
      use. In this case, the corresponding governments and public authorities
      should also be given an appropriate opportunity to register or
      assign in advance the registration of ISO alpha-2 and 3 letter
      country codes as second level domains within the new gTLDs.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Regarding the new TLDs, we note that on
      this occasion, applications for TLDs with two letters or with
      strings which may correspond to possible country codes, were
      not approved by the ICANN Board. Should ICANN consider creating
      new gTLDs in the future with only two letters or which may correspond
      to a possible country code, we would recommend that ICANN and
      the prospective Registry organisations consult with the ISO 3166
      Maintenance Agency and with the governments and public authorities
      concerned before taking any action in this area.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Regarding other geographical indications
      and terms, including ISO country names, we recall that these
      will be the subject of further consideration by the GAC and that
      meanwhile we would encourage the new Registries take steps to
      avoid registering such names at any level of the domain name
      system, pending the outcome of the current Second WIPO Internet
      Domain Name Process. We also note that the WIPO process is addressing
      other categories of names as well, and that the new Registries
      should be advised accordingly.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Sincerely,</FONT></P>
