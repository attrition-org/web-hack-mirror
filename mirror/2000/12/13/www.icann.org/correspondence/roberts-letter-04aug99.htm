<P align=left>The Honorable Howard L. Berman<BR>
    Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property<BR>
    House Committee on Judiciary<BR>2330 
Rayburn House Office Building<BR>Washington, D.C. 20515</P>
<P align=left>Dear Congressman Berman:</P>
  <P align=left>This is in response to <a href="berman-letter-29july99.htm">your 
    letter of July 29, 1999</a>, in which you ask what ICANN mechanisms exist 
    to deal with complaints of the public about the activities of ICANN-accredited 
    registrars.</P>
  <P align=left>As you know, ICANN's role is to serve as a consensus-development 
    entity with respect to the management of certain (mostly technical) aspects 
    of the Internet Domain Name System ("DNS"). Because it is a private sector 
    consensus body, ICANN derives its "authority" from contracts with participants 
    in the DNS, and the scope of its activities is limited by its Articles of 
    Incorporation and Bylaws, copies of which are available at <a href="../index.html">www.icann.org</a>. 
    In general, these confine ICANN to adopting and implementing consensus policies 
    with respect to a very narrow set of responsibilities.</P>
  <P align=left>One of the areas in which ICANN has some responsibilities is the 
    promotion of competition in the registration of domain names. Under its November 
    25, 1998, <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/icann-memorandum.htm">Memorandum 
    of Understanding</a> with the Department of Commerce, ICANN agreed to undertake 
    the job of determining whether entities seeking to become competitive registrars 
    in the .com, .net and .org domains, previously served only by Network Solutions, 
    meet minimum qualifications to offer such services. These qualifications were 
    established through extensive discussion within the Internet community, including 
    posting for comment of detailed proposals for an accreditation program, solicitation 
    of input from the community on 51 specific issues concerning the requirements 
    appropriate for accreditation, receipt and consideration of over 50 written 
    comments received from interested companies and individuals, and oral comments 
    by members of the community at a public forum held during the <a href="http://www.icann.org/singaporesummary.html">ICANN 
    quarterly meeting in early March 1999</a>.</P>
  <P align=left>The outcome of this process is an <a href="http://www.icann.org/policy_statement.html">accreditation 
    policy</a> that seeks to encourage robust competition among registrars by 
    keeping entry barriers low while enhancing the Internet's stability through 
    such measures as data escrow to ensure that registered domain names are preserved 
    in the event an accredited registrar goes out of business. (The policy is 
    available at <a href="http://www.icann.org/policy_statement.html">www.icann.org/policy_statement.html</a>.) 
    In general, the requirements for accreditation include a demonstration of 
    basic minimum technical and financial capabilities (including general liability 
    insurance), the absence of past criminal or fraudulent conduct, and agreement 
    to abide by policies adopted through the ICANN consensus process covering 
    specified subjects, including domain-name/trademark dispute resolution and 
    the public availability of contact information through WHOIS services. ICANN 
    has already announced the accreditation of 57 organizations to begin offering 
    name registration services in the .com, .net and .org domains as soon as the 
    test process now underway is completed, and several new applications are being 
    received each week. The names of those 57 entities can be found at <a href="../registrars/accreditation-qualified-list.html">www.icann.org/registrars/accreditation-qualified-list.html</a>.</P>
  <P align=left>Since its inception, ICANN has maintained an e-mailbox for comments 
    from the public on general topics at <a href="mailto:comments@icann.org">comments@icann.org</a>, 
    and any complaints about ICANN-accredited registrars may be sent to this address. 
    Complaints not intended for public posting may be sent directly to me at <a href="mailto:roberts@icann.org">roberts@icann.org</a>. 
    Since the beginning of the test process on April 26, ICANN has received a 
    few complaints, either through the comment mailbox or by direct contact, about 
    accredited registrars (as well as a larger number about NSI). Any complaints 
    received are reviewed by ICANN staff to determine whether they raise a question 
    of compliance with the affected registrar's accreditation agreement. If they 
    do, the matter is promptly raised with the affected registrar to achieve voluntary 
    compliance if possible. In most cases, however, complaints involve specific 
    consumer disputes not implicating any registrar's accreditation agreement.</P>
<P align=left>While ICANN has been serving in an informal way to forward the 
complaints in these cases to the appropriate registrar, it has neither the 
resources nor the charter to serve as a consumer complaint agency for the DNS. 
The registrars are, of course, businesses subject to the processes of voluntary 
self-regulatory bodies (such as the Better Business Bureau), and are also 
subject to civil claims in court and, in sufficiently widespread or serious 
cases, to governmental enforcement of consumer-protection laws. For ICANN to 
attempt to undertake to process and resolve consumer complaints would obviously 
require a significant change in both its mission and its resources, and would be 
incompatible with the narrow reason for its existence: to provide the vehicle 
for private sector management of a limited number of technical and policy 
aspects of the DNS.</P>
<P align=left>I hope this is responsive to your inquiry. Please let me know if I 
can provide any further information.</P>
