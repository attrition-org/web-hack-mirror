    Interim President and CEO </p>
  <p align="left">I am in receipt of your response to NSI's June 11th gTLD Names 
    Council nomination letter. I agree with your assertion that it was not the 
    responsibility of the gTLD constituency to deal with the lack of representation 
    of the Individual Domain Name Owners (IDNO) and the Top Level Domain Association 
    (TLDA) in the Names Council; however, that misses the point. Our clear intention 
    was to provide an easy interim voice in the Names Council for these two constituencies, 
    while diffusing your threat to modify your bylaws to deny the gTLD constituency 
    its three seats. This was a sincere and reasoned proposal, offered in the 
    spirit of building some initial trust. For the record, I am greatly disappointed 
    at your response to this NSI gesture to ICANN. So be it. </p>
  <p align="left">We are mindful of the Board resolution issued in Berlin requesting 
    that the gTLD Registry Constituency voluntarily relinquish its right under 
    the bylaws to select three representatives to the Names Council of the DNSO. 
    We are also mindful of the statement that the Board would amend its bylaws 
    to eliminate such representation if this action were not taken "voluntarily." 
    Notwithstanding this resolution, and in light of your rejection of our earlier 
    proposal, the gTLD constituency respectfully submits the following three representatives 
    to the Names Council of the DNSO in accordance with Art VI-B, Sec. 2(a) of 
    the Bylaws:</p>
