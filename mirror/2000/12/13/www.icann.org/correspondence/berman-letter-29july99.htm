  <P align=left>Dear Mr. Roberts: </P>
  <P align=left>Thank you very much for appearing before the Courts and Intellectual 
    Property Subcommittee on July 28, 1999. I am writing to request additional 
    information to supplement your testimony.</P>
  <P align=left>Please describe what mechanisms ICANN has in place to receive 
    and act upon complaints from members of the public that ICANN-accredited registrars 
    are not operating in accordance with their Registration Accreditation Agreements. 
    To whom should such complaints be directed? How fast will ICANN commit to 
    act upon them and respond to the complainant?</P>
  <P align=left>The hearing record remains open through August 5, 1999. However, 
    if you will be unable to respond by this date, please contact Stacy Baird 
    in my office at 202-225-4695, and we will try to make other arrangements to 
    include your response in the record.</P>
