FOR ASSIGNED NAMES AND NUMBERS<BR>
TO QUESTIONS CONTAINED IN JUNE 22, 1999 LETTER<BR>
FROM CHAIRMAN TOM BLILEY TO ESTHER DYSON</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers (&quot;ICANN&quot;) is a private, non-profit corporation
formed by the global Internet community to facilitate the transfer
of various DNS management responsibilities from the United States
Government to the private sector. It has no permanent staff, and
to date has relied primarily on private donations for partial
recovery of its costs. These constraints have made responding
in the manner and time required by the Committee a serious challenge.
Nevertheless, ICANN believes that the information and material
provided here is responsive to, and fully answers, the questions
posed by the Committee. All source materials referenced herein
can be found at ICANN's website, <A HREF="../index.html">www.icann.org</A>,
and are attached as Attachments 1-8 for the Committee's convenience.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Committee's questions, along with ICANN's
response, are set forth below in the order in which they were
set out in the Committee's <A HREF="bliley-letter-22june99.htm">letter
of June 22</A>, with each question and response beginning on a
separate page. Specific questions and responses can be found at

    Before imposing a $1 per domain name registration fee, did ICANN
    conduct, or have conducted on its behalf, a legal analysis of
    its authority to impose such a fee? If ICANN did conduct such
    a legal analysis, please provide all records related to the aforementioned
    legal analysis. If ICANN has not conducted such a legal analysis,
    please provide a detailed legal analysis of the source and limits
    of ICANN's authority to impose a $1 per domain name registration
    fee.</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN has not &quot;imposed&quot; any fee;
it has entered into contracts with the registrars it has accredited
(as required by its <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/icann-memorandum.htm">Memorandum
of Understanding (&quot;MOU&quot;)</A> </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Arial"><A HREF="#Footnote1">[1]</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
with the United States Government (&quot;USG&quot;)) for a volume-based
payment designed to partially recover its costs. This may well
not be the optimal procedure for ICANN cost recovery in the future,
but for the reasons set forth below, it appears to be the most
effective and equitable method available at this time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Obviously, ICANN, like any non-profit body,
must have a way to recover its costs. For ICANN, those costs include
(1) the functions that have historically been carried out under,
and funded by, USG contracts and grants, and (2) the additional
costs necessary to carry out its additional responsibilities of
encouraging competition, formalizing previously informal arrangements
through the negotiation of contracts, and creating the global
consensus-development process itself. Global outreach, contracting
with diverse parties, the promotion of competition, and creation
of the processes necessary to promote and encourage global consensus
policies are labor-intensive and complex undertakings, and ICANN's
efforts to carry out those responsibilities have incurred significant
costs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The current situation -- where ICANN incurs
considerable costs but has minimal sources for recovery of those
costs -- is obviously not viable over the long term. It results
from a failed expectation: that all the major participants in
the global Internet community would rapidly come together to make
ICANN an effective vehicle for global consensus development, and
to equitably share the costs of that effort. This expectation
clearly underlies <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/docnsi100698.htm">Amendment
11</A> to the Cooperative Agreement between <A HREF="http://www.networksolutions.com/">Network
Solutions, Inc. (&quot;NSI&quot;)</A> and the USG</FONT><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="#Footnote2">[2]</A></FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial">, which makes sense only on the assumption that
NSI -- the dominant economic entity in the DNS -- quickly joins
the rest of the global Internet community in sharing the costs
of ICANN.</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="#Footnote3">[3]</A></FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> ICANN has never had any government funding, and
in fact it has assumed responsibilities historically funded by
the USG (such as the <A HREF="http://www.iana.org/">IANA</A> functions)
without any commitment by the USG to continue that funding. It
did so because both it and the USG assumed that a permanent cost
recovery mechanism, to which all the relevant DNS participants
(including importantly NSI) would contribute, would quickly be
put in place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Notwithstanding the fact that such a cost
recovery mechanism has yet to be created, ICANN has nevertheless
attempted to carry out its global outreach responsibilities --
including meetings in <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/singaporesummary.html">Singapore</A>
and <A HREF="../berlin/berlin-resolutions.html">Berlin</A>,
and the next two scheduled in <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/santiago/santiago-details.html">Santiago</A>
and Los Angeles. In addition, it has aggressively carried out
the organizational and policy tasks required of it under the MOU
-- encouraging and facilitating the creation of its <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/sonew.htm">Supporting
Organizations</A>, creating various <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/committee.html">Advisory
Committees</A>, and seeking to facilitate the development of consensus
on such subjects as the introduction of competition in the .com,
.net, and .org domains and various intellectual property issues
through publication of proposals for public comment and discussions
at open meetings. None of these activities have been supported
by funds from the USG or any other government.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The USG assumed that some temporary private
&quot;bridge&quot; funding for ICANN might be necessary, but that
ICANN would be able to reach quick agreements with the major participants
in the DNS community, including most importantly NSI -- the only
significant revenue-generating participant in the DNS as a result
of its position as the only entity authorized to provide domain
name services in the .com domain -- that would provide a stable
source of cost recovery for ICANN. This has not happened. The
Committee is free to form its own opinions as to why it has not
happened, but the result is inarguable: ICANN is struggling to
carry out its responsibilities without as yet any institutionalized
method of cost recovery.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">As a temporary solution to this problem,
ICANN has relied on <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/startup-fund.html">private
donations</A> from companies and individuals, and the willingness
of many of its creditors to accept delayed collection of money
due. Still, the goal should be to develop a stable funding structure
which fairly and equitably distributes the costs of ICANN's consensus
development and implementation activities among the various entities
and segments of the Internet community that benefit from its technical
coordination services.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">With this background, the following describes
the ICANN cost recovery structure that has just become effective
on July 1. It begins with a description of the historical way
in which ICANN functions provided in the past were funded and
a description of the additional functions that ICANN has been
required to absorb. It concludes with a discussion of the cost-recovery
mechanisms currently contemplated by ICANN and the alternatives
that might exist.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">A. The IANA Function</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN has assumed financial and administrative
responsibility for the <A HREF="http://www.iana.org/">Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)</A> and its staff in Marina
del Rey, California. In the earliest days of the Internet, the
IANA maintained the authoritative lists of assigned domain names
and numbers, under research contracts with the <A HREF="http://www.darpa.mil/">Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)</A>, a part of the U.S.
Department of Defense. As the Internet evolved and grew, the IANA
continued its role as a coordinating entity, responsible for coordinating
the domain name system (DNS) and the assignment of IP addresses.
In addition, the IANA worked with the Internet's standards bodies
and protocol developers to coordinate the assignment and publication
of the Internet's technical standards.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The IANA also administers the delegation
of country-code top-level domains to local managers, communicates
with TLD managers on a range of issues, and supervises the resolution
of disputes over delegations of registration authority when they
arise. In addition, the IANA manages the .int domain, which is
exclusively reserved for international treaty organizations, such
as NATO.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The IANA also assigns large blocks of IP
addresses to the regional IP address registries, which in turn
allocate IP addresses to Internet Service Providers and others
for distribution to end-users. There are currently three regional
IP address registries: <A HREF="http://www.apnic.net/">APNIC</A>
for the Asia-Pacific region; <A HREF="http://www.ripe.net/info/ncc/aboutncc.html">RIPE-NCC</A>
for Europe and North Africa; and <A HREF="http://www.arin.net/">ARIN</A>
for North and South America and sub-Saharan Africa.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The DARPA research contracts paid for the
full direct and indirect costs of the IANA, including staff salaries
and wages, office facilities and rent, computer equipment and
network connectivity, <A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/">ISI</A>'s
institutional overhead, and telephone and travel expenses. These
costs were assumed by ICANN as of January 1, 1999, and ICANN has
received no USG funding support since that time.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">B. Creation of a Competitive gTLD Registry-Registrar
  System</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Consistent with the clear consensus of the global Internet 
  community, and its mandate from the USG in both the <A HREF="../general/white-paper-05jun98.htm">White 
  Paper</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/icann-memorandum.htm">MOU</A>, 
  ICANN has begun the process of determining and implementing community consensus 
  views on how to introduce competition into the market for domain name registration 
  services in the .com, .net, and .org generic top-level domains (gTLDs). Those 
  services are currently provided by NSI under an exclusive Cooperative Agreement 
  with the USG. Specifically, NSI performs two functions for those generic top-level 
  domains: the registry and the registrar. As registry operator, NSI maintains 
  the authoritative database of registered domain names and the IP addresses to 
  which they correspond. As registrar, NSI interacts with customers, taking registration 
  orders and placing registration information into the registry (the central database).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">These functions in recent years</FONT><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="#Footnote4">[4]</A></FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> have been funded by a annual fee levied by NSI
on every registered domain name. NSI charges a minimum of $70
($35 per year)</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="#Footnote5">[5]</A></FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> for each registration, which are required to cover
an initial registration period of two years. Thereafter, NSI charges
a $35 fee for each one-year renewal of each registered domain
name, even though the actual costs of renewal are obviously significantly
lower than the actual costs of an original registration. These
mandatory fees exceed the actual costs of providing those services;
they produced revenue of almost $100 million for NSI in 1998 (nearly
a 100% increase over 1997), and profits of $11 million (an increase
of 175% over the preceding year). This performance has been rewarded
by a market valuation for NSI of over $2.5 billion at this writing.
Community unhappiness with the level of these fees, and the lack
of choice in the services offered by NSI, have been significant
elements in the creation of nearly universal demand for the introduction
of competition in the provision of name registration services.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The introduction of competition into the
market for registrar services will undoubtedly reduce (probably
quite significantly) the cost to consumers of registering a domain
name, improve customer service and generate diverse new options
for Internet users. At the current level of name registrations,
even just a $2 reduction in the average cost of an annual name
registration would save consumers approximately than $20 million
annually, and the value of improved service and increased flexibility
is obviously significant. Unfortunately, the costs of implementing
the transition from sole provider to competition are not trivial.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN is required, pursuant to its <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/icann-memorandum.htm">MOU</A>
with the USG (as contemplated in <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/docnsi100698.htm">Amendment
11</A> of the Cooperative Agreement between NSI and the USG) to
accredit companies that wish to become competitive registrars
in the .com, .net, and .org top-level domains. Accordingly, ICANN
staff were (and are) required to draft <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/registrars/accreditation-overview.html">application
guidelines</A>, review public comments and make appropriate revisions,
receive and review applications on a ongoing basis, verify application
information, communicate with applicants, draft and sign <A HREF="../ra-agreement-051299.html">accreditation
agreements</A>, and assist successfully accredited applicants
with what has proven to be the unexpectedly difficult process
of gaining workable access to NSI's Shared Registry System. Because
of the inherently legal nature of the accreditation process, ICANN's
outside legal counsel is also necessarily heavily involved in
this process. This process has resulted in the accreditation of
five test bed registrars, and the subsequent accreditation of
<A HREF="../registrars/accreditation-qualified-list.html">52
additional registrars</A> who are slated to begin competing in
this space at the end of the test bed phase, now scheduled for
July 16, 1999. The <A HREF="../registrars/accredited-list.html">complete
list of accredited registrars</A>, which includes such organizations
as <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A>, <A HREF="http://www.aol.com/">AOL</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.psi.com/">PSINet</A>, <A HREF="http://www.rcn.com/">RCN</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.verio.com/">Verio</A>, can be found at
<A HREF="../index.html">www.icann.org</A> and is attached
at Attachment 3.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The transition to a competitive registration
system also requires the execution of a set of technical functions.
Foremost among these is the design and management of a registration
data escrow function. In order to assure the stability and uninterrupted
functioning of the Internet upon the technical or business failure
of a registrar, it is essential that accredited registrars escrow
their essential registration data daily in a way immediately accessible
to ICANN, thus allowing the data to be easily transferred or reconstructed
if necessary. This backup function has historically been performed
by NSI and funded through its mandatory $35/year registration
fee; the similar function in a competitive environment is clearly
more complex than it has been in the past, where NSI was both
the registry operator and the sole registrar.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN has also been working with the five
accredited test bed registrars to develop a robust and reliable
WHOIS service (which allows users to look up domain name registration
data) for the new competitive environment with its multiple registrars.
The WHOIS service was historically provided by NSI as part of
its registry function, funded through its $35/year registration
fee. Once it was clear that there would be movement to a competitive
registrar environment, NSI decided to eliminate that service from
its registry function, thus eliminating a centralized WHOIS service
and creating an additional cost both for new registrars and for
the consumers and business entities that had relied on that service.
Today, in the absence of a centralized WHOIS service, anyone seeking
contact information for a domain name must first determine which
registrar has registered the name, and then seek contact information
from that registrar. Since a comprehensive and complete WHOIS
service is such a valuable resource for the Internet community,
ICANN is working to replace that service now that it is no longer
provided by NSI.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In sum, NSI's current mandatory registration
fee of $35/year has historically funded NSI's registry and registrar
operations, including data backup and WHOIS services. Accredited
post-test bed registrars will have to similarly have to fund their
operations (including data backup and WHOIS services) from whatever
registration fee the market will bear, which is highly likely
to be $35 or (more probably) less. In addition, they will pay
NSI some fee for every domain name registered</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Arial"><A HREF="#Footnote6">[6]</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
that is approved by the USG for registry access, and provide their
share of ICANN cost recovery at the rate of no more than $1 per
domain name registered.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Even with the relatively limited amount
of competition that has begun for name registrations, no accredited
registrar has yet to offer services at a rate higher than the
$35 charged by NSI, and thus both NSI's $9 registry fee and the
$1 cost recovery fee due to ICANN are being absorbed by the registrars,
not paid by users, and presumably being reflected in lower operating
margins than might otherwise exist. In this sense, at least, even
the minimal competition that has been introduced into the registration
services market is already having a positive impact, although
since NSI is not paying either fee it continues to enjoy a significant
and unfair competitive advantage over all other name registration
providers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thus, the likely result of the replacement
of a situation where there is a single monopoly registrar with
one where there are more than 50 competitive registrars offering
name registration services will be to reduce the cost to consumers
of domain name registration services, and to produce a profit
margin for all registrars (including NSI) which is lower than
that enjoyed today by NSI. This expected drop in registration
fees itself appears likely to translate into millions of dollars
of savings for Internet users, and to be far greater in the aggregate
than the administrative and technical expenses incurred by ICANN
in carrying out its role in helping to introduce and sustain a
competitive market in registration services. In any event, those
expenses will certainly be far less than the cost imposed on consumers
for those services in the past, and will far exceed the contractual
cost recovery fee paid by accredited registrars to ICANN.</FONT></P>

  <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">C. Coordination of the Root Server System</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">As called for in the U.S. Government's <A
HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">White
Paper on &quot;The Management of Internet Names and Addresses,&quot;</A>
ICANN has entered into a <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/crada.htm">Cooperative
Research and Development Agreement</A> (CRADA) with the USG to
develop and implement improvements in the management of the root
server system.</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="#Footnote7">[7]</A></FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> The root server system is a set of thirteen file
servers, which each contain authoritative databases listing all
TLDs. Currently, NSI operates the primary root server, which maintains
the authoritative root database and replicates changes to the
other root servers on a daily basis, under a contract with and
the control of the USG. Different organizations around the world,
including NSI and ICANN, operate the other 12 root servers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To carry out its responsibilities under
the CRADA, ICANN has established a <A HREF="../dnsroot-com.html">Root
Server System Advisory Committee</A> chaired by Prof. Jun Murai,
an ICANN director and the operator of the &quot;M&quot; root server
in Japan. Though populated by volunteers, including the operators
of all 13 root servers, the Committee's work will entail some
staff costs and expenses to be funded by ICANN. ICANN is also
working with the existing root server operators on plans to enhance
the already-impressive security of the present root server system,
with the goal of reducing even further the risk of disruption
or outside corruption of this important directory information.
These various efforts, which include consideration of the structure
of the root server system, the location and operation of the primary
root server, and related issues, have generated ICANN staff and
equipment costs, and will likely require additional costs in the
future.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">D. Operation of the &quot;L&quot; Root
  Server</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN has recently assumed responsibility
(but has received no government funding) for the &quot;L&quot;
root server, formerly operated by the University of Southern California's
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/">Information Sciences Institute (&quot;ISI&quot;)</A>,
and previously funded by the USG through a contract with ISI.
It has received no government funding for this.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">E. The Process of Consensus Development
  and Implementation</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">While the substantive functions being assumed
by ICANN all have roots and antecedents in the Internet's technical
administrative structures, the process that ICANN was established
to facilitate constitutes an unprecedented experiment in private
sector consensus decision-making on a global scale. Global consensus
is a difficult goal to achieve in the best of circumstances; in
the contentious atmosphere that exists today, where the transition
of important management responsibilities from government to private-sector
mechanisms has been combined with a simultaneous effort to move
from a single monopoly provider of services to a competitive market,
that task is extremely complicated. To achieve a policy-making
process that is open and transparent, based on Internet community
consensus, bottom-up in its orientation, and globally representative
has required the establishment and operation of a number of bodies,
organizations, and committees through which this process can occur.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Board of Directors.</FONT></I><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN's <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/board.html">Board
of Directors</A> currently consists of ten individuals, and will
be expanding in the very near future to nineteen. Though unpaid
volunteers, future Directors will be entitled to reimbursement
of their ICANN-related expenses, such as travel, lodging, and
other costs related to attending ICANN meetings.</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Arial"><A HREF="#8">[8]</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> Board
expenses also include the costs of teleconferences, written briefing
materials, and staff support.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN Staff.</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
In addition to the IANA and technical staff discussed above, ICANN
plans to hire a small executive staff to handle legal and policy
matters, provide support to the President and Board of Directors,
manage internal networks and systems, handle the corporation's
financial affairs, organize meetings, foster communications with
and discussions among the global Internet community, and support
advisory committees and supporting organizations, as appropriate.
ICANN also contemplates hiring outside consultants on specific
technical and policy matters from time to time, as needed. To
the extent these expenses relate to the IANA staff (such as financial
accounting, payroll administration, network services, fringe benefits,
employment taxes, and legal support), they represent a transfer
of financial responsibility from ISI, which formerly funded this
overhead through DARPA research contracts. The remainder are the
additional resources needed to undertake the very significant
new responsibilities required of ICANN if this experiment in private
sector management is to be successful -- including global consensus
development and the introduction and promotion of competition.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN Meetings.</FONT></I></B><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> If ICANN is to truly function as a global consensus-development
entity, it and its processes must be accessible to the entire
global Internet community. To help meet this objective, ICANN
holds its periodic meetings in different regions of the world.
While this is a important contribution to global access to consensus
policy development, it is a significant expense to plan, organize
and hold each year four three-day sequences of Board, Committee,
and Supporting Organization meetings in different cities around
the world, including meeting room rental and travel and lodging
expenses. In a further effort to make its processes available
to as much of the global Internet community as possible, ICANN
provides <A HREF="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/icann/berlin/archive/index.html">real-time
broadcasts of its meetings</A> over the Internet, including video
and audio and the ability to send real-time comments and questions
from anywhere in the world visible to those in the meeting room.
This obviously requires significant technical facilities, which
limits the number and type of meeting facilities available. In
addition, enabling real-time broadcasts and online participation
requires at least $25,000 per meeting for the needed equipment,
high-bandwidth net connectivity, and technical staff. In addition,

  <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">F. Possible Cost Recovery Mechanisms</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">As a non-profit, ICANN is required to cover
its costs, but to take in no more money than is necessary to fund
necessary costs and establish reasonable reserves for future expenses.
The <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">White
Paper</A> assumed that these funds would come from &quot;domain
name registries, regional IP registries, or other entities identified
by the Board.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Unfortunately, in a circumstance where the
most significant name registry is refusing to fully participate
in the development of community consensus through ICANN and indeed
has now become loudly critical of ICANN's very existence after
publicly supporting the creation of ICANN throughout the USG policy
development process, the simplest approach -- to allocate ICANN's
costs to the various registries in some appropriate way -- is
not feasible.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The ICANN Board continues to believe that
it is highly desirable for the name and address registries</FONT><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="#Footnote9">[9]</A></FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> to participate in the funding of the costs of consensus
policy development, as part of a stable cost-recovery structure
that is fair and equitable to all concerned. Nevertheless, given
the current circumstances, it was clear that some alternative
mechanism would need to be developed, at least for the immediate
future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">As an initial matter, the largest portion
of the time and energy in consensus development today is directed
toward introducing and sustaining registrar competition in the
.com, .net, and .org top-level domains (which are by far the largest
and most profitable of the approximately 250 top-level domains,
accounting for 75% of all domain name registrations). Since NSI
and ICANN have been unable to reach an agreement on a contractual
relationship, relying on the NSI-operated registry was not a practical
option. The next best alternative source of funds was the registrars
that interact with that registry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">For any funding from <U>registries</U>,
the simplest way to allocate cost recovery would seem to be by
volume. Because domain name registrations will be marketed by
<U>registrars</U> in the first instance, ICANN proposed that these
costs could be borne by the registrars directly, thus eliminating
the registry as a conduit (and possible bottleneck) for the recovery
of costs. Assuming a competitive market, the volume of registrations
is some measure of the benefits that consensus coordination are
providing to an individual registrar (and ultimately to users).
Based on this principle, ICANN proposed that its first-year transition
funding be structured on the basis of a fee to be paid by each
registrar, calculated by multiplying the number of registered
domain names by a variable fee equal to no more than $1 per domain
per year. Because ICANN is a cost-recovery non-profit entity,
this variable would likely decrease over time as either or all
of three likely events occurs: (i) reduction of overall costs
as startup tasks are completed; (ii) the addition of new funding
sources, and/or (iii) a continued increase in the number of registered
domain names. In order to ensure an ongoing source of operating
revenue, ICANN proposed that the fee be transmitted from the registrar
on a monthly basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/draftguidelines.html#IIL">proposed
formula</A> was <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/berlin/budget.html">posted
for public comment</A> earlier this year; it generated very little
comment, and even less opposition, either in principle or on the
details. Indeed, the domain name and address registry communities
have expressed broad support for the principle of a fair and equitable
distribution of ICANN's costs among all registries with access
to the root, taking into account the variations in usage and ability
to pay. Thus, it seems clear that this approach, which seems to
fairly allocate the costs of consensus policy development, enjoys
broad support from the Internet community, notwithstanding rhetorical
attacks from some quarters.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Nevertheless, the approach described above
is explicitly designed for the <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/budget.htm">first
full fiscal-year budget cycle</A> of ICANN (July 1, 1999 - June
30, 2000), which takes place during the continuing organizational
efforts of ICANN and during the transitional period set forth
by the USG for this privatization effort. Thus, it includes some
significant one-time expenses associated with that initial organizational
effort, including costs that result from the inability to structure
an appropriate contractual relationship with NSI. These costs
will presumably not continue into the future, and thus at least
to that extent ICANN's costs for consensus development should
go down. In addition, if NSI were to finally decide to fully participate
in the consensus-development process through ICANN, that would
affect the practical options available for cost recovery. In any
event, this particular cost-recovery mechanism is obviously subject
to improvement or change at any time that an alternative captures
consensus support. ICANN certainly welcomes any comments or suggestions
on future cost-recovery mechanisms based on the principle of fair
and open distribution of costs among the registries that make
up the DNS.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN has no statutory or regulatory &quot;authority&quot;
of any kind. It has only the power of the consensus that it represents,
and the willingness of members of the Internet community to participate
in and abide by the consensus development process that is at the
heart of ICANN. It is required under the <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/icann-memorandum.htm">MOU</A>
with the USG to accredit competitive registrars before they may
access the .com, .org, and .net registries, but the effect of
this accreditation is governed by <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/docnsi100698.htm">Amendment
11</A> of the Cooperative Agreement between NSI and the USG and
the USG's inherent control over the operation of these registries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Given these facts, ICANN has undertaken
no such legal analysis, nor has it had any reason to create one.
If the Committee has been told that ICANN has the power to terminate
NSI&#146;s authority to register domain names, or has asserted
that it does, the Committee has been misinformed. To clarify this
point, the following description of the process for accrediting
registrars may be helpful.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">From January 1, 1993, until early June 1999,
domain names in the .com, .net, and .org top-level domains were
registered exclusively by NSI under a Cooperative Agreement between
it and the USG. As noted in the June 1998 <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">Statement
of Policy (White Paper)</A> </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A
HREF="#Footnote10">[10]</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">, public
comments showed &quot;widespread dissatisfaction about the absence
of competition in domain name registration.&quot; Accordingly,
in the <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">White
Paper</A> the USG stated its intention to enter a &quot;ramp down
[of its] cooperative agreement with NSI [then scheduled to expire
September 30, 1998] with the objective of introducing competition
into the domain name space.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To implement the &quot;ramp down,&quot;
NSI and the USG negotiated <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/docnsi100698.htm">Amendment
11</A> to NSI&#146;s cooperative agreement, by which NSI and the
USG agreed to extend the agreement for a two-year period (until
September 30, 2000), during which NSI agreed to revise the system
for registrations in .com, .net, and .org to allow competition
for registrar services. Since NSI was going to continue to be
the sole administrator of the registries for .com, .net, and .org
for at least two years, while simultaneously acting as one of
the competitors marketing name registration services in those
domains, <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/docnsi100698.htm">Amendment
11</A> provided that a neutral body to be formed by the Internet
community (&quot;NewCo,&quot; subsequently <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/icannnewco.htm">designated
by the USG as ICANN</A>) would carry out the coordinating functions
required to ensure a freely competitive registration market. In
Amendment 11, NSI expressly acknowledged that NewCo &quot;will
have the authority, consistent with the provisions of the Statement
of Policy and the agreement between the USG and NewCo, to carry
out NewCo&#146;s responsibilities.&quot; On November 25, 1998,
the <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/icannnewco.htm">Department
of Commerce recognized ICANN as the NewCo entity</A> referred
to in Amendment 11, and this was specifically reiterated to NSI
<A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/icannnewco.htm">by
letter</A> on February&nbsp;26, 1999.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To achieve the White Paper&#146;s &quot;objective
of introducing competition into the domain name space,&quot; <A
HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/docnsi100698.htm">Amendment
11</A> provided that NSI would implement a &quot;Shared Registration
System&quot; to &quot;create an environment conducive to the development
of robust competition among domain name registrars.&quot; The
schedule agreed to by NSI and the USG provided for several phases,
beginning with a &quot;test bed&quot; in which NSI agreed to &quot;establish
a test bed supporting actual registrations in .com, .net and .org
by 5 registrars accredited by NewCo (Accredited Registrars)&quot;
and ending with a reengineering of the overall system to &quot;assure
that NSI, acting as registry, shall give all licensed Accredited
Registrars (including NSI acting as registrar) equivalent access
(&#145;equal access&#146;) to registry services through the Shared
Registration System.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thus, NSI agreed in Amendment 11 that, after
the introduction of competition into the registrar business, it
would operate the registry to give access to, <U>and only to</U>,
ICANN-accredited registrars (including NSI). In this way, the
level playing field necessary for effective competition in a shared
registry environment would be established.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In sum, ICANN neither has nor claims any
&quot;authority to terminate NSI's authority to register domain
names.&quot; Instead, the requirement that NSI must be accredited
by ICANN to act as a registrar after the introduction of competition,
so that it operates to the extent possible (given its continuing
operation of the registries for .com. .net, and .org) under the
same conditions as all other competing registrars, flows directly
from NSI&#146;s own agreement with the USG.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To date, NSI has not requested to be accredited
by ICANN, and certain individuals purporting to speak for NSI
have publicly stated that it does not intend to be accredited.
ICANN has received no official communication on this issue from
NSI, and stands ready to treat an accreditation application from
NSI in exactly the same way it has responded to similar applications
by others.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In fact, in the event NSI chooses to seek
accreditation, ICANN is required by its agreement with the USG
to perform its accreditation function fairly, having specifically
agreed in the MOU not to &quot;act unjustifiably or arbitrarily
to injure particular persons or entities or particular categories
of persons or entities.&quot; This fairness provision, which parallels
provisions in <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/docnsi100698.htm">Amendment
11</A>, in ICANN&#146;s registrar accreditation policy </FONT><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="#Footnote11">[11]</A></FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial">, and ICANN&#146;s own bylaws </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Arial"><A HREF="#Footnote12">[12]</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">,
appropriately and effectively ensures against arbitrary denial
of accreditation to NSI or any other registrar.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, as a practical matter it is important
that NSI, the most significant current provider of domain name
services in the most widely used domains and the registry operator
for those domains, be an active participant and contributor to
the consensus development process that is ICANN. Its refusal to
date to be a positive contributor to that process has increased
the cost of the transition from USG to private sector management,
reduced the speed with which important issues can be decided,
and has made it much more difficult to move forward with what
is already an extremely difficult task. No responsible participant
in these processes wants to see NSI excluded from the ongoing
efforts, and thus it is important to the success of this privatization
effort that NSI quickly take up its appropriate role as an important
contributor to the creation of community consensus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN has not sought to &quot;retain intellectual
property rights over registrar data,&quot; and thus has not had
occasion to conduct a legal analysis concerning its ability to
do so. ICANN&#146;s <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/policy_statement.html">Statement
of Registrar Accreditation Policy</A> (adopted on March 4, 1999
after extensive public comment) provides that ownership of intellectual
property rights in registrar data, to the extent those rights
exist under law, is not &quot;retained&quot; by ICANN, but instead
may be claimed by the registrars themselves. This treatment of
intellectual property is reflected in the provisions of the accreditation
agreements ICANN has entered, and stands ready to enter, with
all accredited registrars.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">During the process of domain-name registration,
registrars collect various data typed in by registrants. This
data includes the domain name itself, identifying information
about the registrant, the registrant&#146;s designation of administrative,
technical, zone, and billing contacts for the domain name, and
technical information concerning the Internet &quot;nameservers&quot;
that are associated with the domain name. Historically, this data
has been freely available to those operating and using the Internet
on a query basis through a service known as &quot;WHOIS,&quot;
to assist them in resolving problems that may arise with domain
names.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Under current United States law, it is highly
doubtful that collection by registrars of this factual information
gives rise to any enforceable intellectual property rights. Under
</FONT><A HREF="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=US&vol=499&invol=340"><I><FONT
 FACE="Arial">Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service
Co.,</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> 499 U.S. 340 (1991)</FONT></A><FONT
 FACE="Arial">, copyright may not be claimed in factual information
itself, but only in the selection, coordination, or arrangement
of the information in a sufficiently original way. It therefore
violates no copyright for others to use the registrar data for
their own purposes according to their own selection, coordination,
and arrangement. Similarly, because the registrar data has long
been available to the public for the asking, both by Internet
tradition and by U.S. Government requirements, it would not seem
to be subject to legitimate claims of trade-secret rights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Although not giving rise to intellectual-property
rights under current U.S. law, registrar data may be subject to
claims of intellectual property rights under the laws of other
countries, or under future laws that may be enacted in this country
at the state or federal level. Claims under such laws, if not
accommodated to the Internet&#146;s needs, could complicate the
efforts of the technical community to ensure stable and reliable
operation of the Internet and the legitimate needs of the Internet
user community for information about domain names. Pending proposals
for extending U.S. intellectual-property law to cover databases,
fortunately, take into account these special operational needs
of the Internet. For example, <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_bills&docid=f:h1858ih.txt.pdf">H.R.
1858 (the Consumer and Investor Access to Information Act of 1999)</A>,
which protects publishers from others who seek to compete unfairly
by copying and selling the publishers&#146; databases, specifically
excludes coverage of databases &quot;incorporating information
collected or organized&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . to perform the function
of addressing, routing, transmitting, or storing Internet communications&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The <A HREF="../ra-agreement-051299.html">accreditation
agreements</A> entered by registrars with ICANN include provisions
addressing these stability concerns. Although registrars are permitted
by their agreements to claim any applicable intellectual-property
rights in most types of registrar data, they provide two licenses
to the data to accommodate the needs of the broader Internet community:
(1)&nbsp;a non-exclusive worldwide license to use of the data
for or on behalf of ICANN for its Internet-management purposes,
such as to permit a substitute registrar to support the customer
in case the original registrar goes out of business, and (2)&nbsp;a
non-exclusive license to use the data in WHOIS services. Registrars
also disclaim rights in a limited core of routing data that must
be broadly copied and distributed throughout the Internet to permit
the domain-name system to function properly. These limited contractual
provisions ensure that the data that accredited registrars collect
will be available in specific limited ways necessary to ensure
the Internet&#146;s continued stable and convenient operation,
but otherwise leave with the registrar any intellectual property
rights that it may be able to claim in any particular jurisdiction.</FONT></P>

had to rely on private donations as its only source of funds.
Since these revenues have been far short of ICANN's actual expenses,
the Initial Board members have to date forgone almost all expense
reimbursement in order to leave ICANN's limited funds to pay employees

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Revenue sources that are projected to support
ICANN projected expenditures and reserve requirements in the next
fiscal year include:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Total revenue for the fiscal year is
    budgeted at $5.9 million. Of this amount, a total of $5.0 million
    is projected from payments to ICANN from Registries and Registrars.
    An initial registrar fee schedule of $5,000 per year plus $1
    per year per assigned name was adopted by the ICANN Board as
    part of its public comment and decision process in establishing
    registrar accreditation guidelines for the .com, .net and .org
    domains in March, 1999. This schedule will be used in FY 99-00,
    subject to revision based on over- or under recovery of the budgeted
    revenue amount in this category.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Registrar accreditation activities in
    the .com, .net and .org domains are assumed to continue in the
    next fiscal year and are estimated to produce $100,000 in revenue,
    based on the current fee schedule of $1000 per application for
    accreditation.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">- A total of $700,000 is anticipated from
    grants and contributions. Some of this amount reflects receipt
    of funds pledged during ICANN's startup period. It is also anticipated
    that one or more governments will make grants to ICANN to assist
    in support of the transition program, and a total of $400,000
    has been budgeted from this source.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">- The Other category includes $100,000
    as an estimate of amounts received to reimburse ICANN for meeting
    and travel expenses incurred for Supporting Organizations and
    other similar activities undertaken as part of ICANN programs.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It should be noted that revenues from accreditation
agreement fees will clearly not reach the projected total of $5.0
million without the participation of all registrars operating
in the .com, .org and .net domains. Thus, the budget assumes the
timely conclusion of current negotiations between the USG and
NSI with regard to the fulfillment of the terms of <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/docnsi100698.htm">Amendment

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The ICANN <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/bylaws-09apr99.html">bylaws</A>
provide that its Board will consist of 19 members, from five different
sources: nine At Large directors elected by a membership that
is in the process of being created; three each from each of the
three Supporting Organizations; and the President and CEO of ICANN,
sitting <I>ex officio</I>. For the necessary elections to take
place, the constituent bodies must be in existence and functioning,
and most of ICANN's efforts to date have been aimed at helping
to facilitate the establishment of these organizations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We currently hope (and expect) that all
of the nine Directors elected by the Supporting Organizations
will be in place before the first annual meeting of ICANN on November
2-4, 1999, in Los Angeles. If this in fact takes place, half of
ICANN's Board at that time will consist of Directors elected by
constituent bodies of ICANN. The other half of the elected Board,
which represents the At Large Directors, is currently expected
to be in place no later than (and hopefully before) the second
annual meeting of ICANN, which will take place in the fall of
2000. Pursuant to the <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">White
Paper</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/icann-memorandum.htm">MOU</A>,
the transition process is scheduled to be completed no later than
October 1, 2000, and the Initial Directors must all have ended
their service by that time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Each of the <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/sonew.htm">Supporting
Organizations</A>, in the tradition of bottom-up processes, is
a self-organizing entity. Since it took six months after the publication
of the <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">White
Paper</A> to organize ICANN to the point that it was recognized
by the USG as the appropriate privatization vehicle, it is not
surprising that it has taken about the same amount of time for
the Supporting Organizations to organize themselves so that they
can be officially recognized by the ICANN Board as representing
community consensus and begin to function.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The <A HREF="http://www.dnso.org/">Domain
Name Supporting Organization (&quot;DNSO&quot;)</A> has been formally
recognized by the ICANN Board, and is now functioning with a provisional
Names Council managing its processes. Six of the seven separate
constituency organizations that make up the Names Council have
also been provisionally recognized, with the seventh expected
soon and final recognition awaiting final proposals consistent
with the principles established through the ICANN process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A proposed structure for the <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/pso/psonew.htm">Protocol
Supporting Organization (&quot;PSO&quot;)</A> has been adopted
by the Board, with a final formal recognition awaiting the conclusion
of a Memorandum of Understanding among ICANN and Internet-related
standards development organizations, expected to come following
the Internet Engineering Task Force meeting this month in Oslo.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The organizers of the <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/aso/asonew.htm">Address
Supporting Organization (&quot;ASO&quot;)</A> have posted a draft
proposal for comment, and anticipate filing a formal proposal
for recognition within the very near future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thus, the entities that are responsible
for the election of half of ICANN's Board are well along in their
self-organizing efforts. There is no group of individuals more
anxious for them to complete these efforts and produce elected
Board members than the current members of the Initial Board, who
look forward with great eagerness to having others share with
them the management challenges of a global consensus development
process. The Initial Board has urged all of the SO organizers
to do everything possible to complete their formation and elect
the Directors for which they are responsible in time for those
Directors to be seated and to participate at ICANN's first annual
meeting in Los Angeles in early November.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The effort to implement the direction in
the bylaws to establish an electorate to select nine At Large
Directors for the ICANN Board has proved to be more difficult.
One of the earliest actions of the Interim Board, on November
25, 1998, was to ask for volunteers from the community at large
to participate in the <A HREF="../membership-com.html">Membership
Advisory Committee (&quot;MAC&quot;)</A> mandated by the ICANN
bylaws. Over 80 expressions of interest were received, and 10
volunteers were selected, with special attention being given to
ensure geographical diversity and a range of practical experience.
The membership consisted of the following people:</FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In addition, Jonathan Zittrain served as
non-voting liaison to the Berkman Center membership study that
was conducted at the request of the ICANN Board for the benefit
of the MAC in its deliberations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The MAC undertook to come up with recommendations
to the Interim Board on the establishment of the necessary electorate.
It worked intensely for several months, with most of its deliberations
and meetings fully available to the public, and it received and
evaluated a great number of recommendations from a variety of
sources. Finally, on May 5, 1999, it provided its <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/berlin/membership_rec.htm">report
to the Board</A>, consisting of 18 principles that it thought
should guide the establishment of the At Large electorate. Those
principles were immediately published for public comment, and
subsequently discussed at an <A HREF="../macberlin.htm">open
MAC meeting on May 25</A> and at ICANN's open meeting in Berlin
on May 26. The Board then <A HREF="../berlin/berlin-resolutions.html#3">accepted</A>,
with gratitude for its hard work, the output of the MAC, and instructed
staff and counsel to evaluate how an At Large electorate could
best be implemented. The staff advice will be published in time
for public comment prior to the next scheduled Board meeting in
late August.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">As the MAC recognized, the establishment
of a representative global electorate to produce half the Directors
of an entity that is responsible for the consensus management
of important global resources requiring both technical and policy
coordination is a very complex task. If the appropriate universe
of persons is considered to be all those who might be directly
affected by the results of the ICANN consensus development process,
this may include several hundred million people. If, on the other
hand, the appropriate universe is only those persons who are knowledgeable
and sufficiently interested to actively participate and stay informed
on the issues with which ICANN is involved, this is likely to
be a very small group of people that may not be at all representative
of Internet users as a group, and who may well have private agendas
that are at least partially responsible for their willingness
to stay involved. The former group is clearly too large to operate
as an effective electorate in this context, and the latter presents
special risks of capture of half the ICANN Board by a determined
minority -- whether it be of commercial interests, political interests,
or for that matter any cohesive group. It certainly is not out
of the question that a particular religious or ethnic minority,
for example, might see the potential capture of a controlling
(or at least blocking) position in an entity that has global responsibilities
over an important part of the Internet as an attractive proposition
worth pursuing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thus, the MAC struggled with how to balance
the various elements of creating such an electorate -- the desire
to empower as many interested and affected people as possible,
with due regard to cultural, geographic and economic diversity
-- with the risks that the electorate might not accomplish its
stated purpose: to provide a voice for the users of the DNS in
the consensus development activities of ICANN that might not be
available in any other way. It ultimately concluded that the risks
of error were so significant here, and the difficulty of recovery
from a mistaken approach so great -- after all, is it likely that
any group that successfully captured a significant number of At
Large Director's seats would voluntarily give them up? -- that
the At Large elections should be preceded by an <A HREF="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rcs/outreach.html">outreach
effort</A> in an attempt to produce an electorate that at least
minimized the possibility of capture by a determined minority.
The consensus of the MAC was that an electorate of 5,000, while
not eliminating that risk, would at least ameliorate it, and was
not so large that it was an impractical goal. Indeed, if 5,000
persons interested in participating in the election of half the
ICANN Board cannot be located from around the world, that fact
would at least raise some questions about the workability of this
particular mechanism for user input.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In addition, the MAC recommended that the
election of At Large Directors be undertaken in at least two tranches,
so that the experience of the first effort could be used to adjust
the process for the remaining elections to the extent necessary
to increase the odds of a broadly representative electorate. Finally,
the MAC recommended a variety of steps to minimize the risk of
outright fraud.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Board largely <A HREF="../berlin/berlin-resolutions.html#3">accepted</A>
these recommendations, and referred them to staff and counsel
for advice on how such a process could best be implemented. However,
it is obvious that there is one severe impediment to proceeding
as the MAC has recommended -- the lack of funds to undertake either
the outreach probably necessary to produce 5,000 members of an
electorate, or the election itself, if it is to be anything more
than a simple counting of unconfirmed e-mail ballots. Any efforts
to minimize fraud will result in costs that ICANN currently has
no ability to pay. Thus, while the Board expects to receive reports
from its staff in time for public comment prior to the meeting
in Santiago in late August, unless and until additional funding
sources are forthcoming it will be difficult to implement any
such program for At Large elections.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If funds do become available, it seems likely
that the Board will accept the MAC's recommendation to hold these
elections in at least two tranches, with a number of Initial Board
members equal to those elected leaving the Board upon those elections.
The first election could conceivably begin soon, depending on
the requirements for the size of the electorate prior to any elections
and the success of any necessary outreach effort.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Board continues to feel that it should
move cautiously on this issue, given the very important consequences
for the future success of the consensus development process through
ICANN. Users of the DNS should obviously have a way to participate
in the ICANN processes, but it would be inconsistent with the
goal of those processes to create a system where those claiming
to represent users could carry out private agendas that might
be intentionally adverse to the creation of a true consensus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There are obviously individuals and groups
in the world whose goal is to disrupt the orderly operation of
systems like the DNS; the <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/icann-pr02july99.htm">recent
hacker attack on an NSI server</A> is a good example. It would
be a total abdication of the responsibility that the Initial Board
has accepted, and clearly not consistent with any consensus position
of the Internet community, to create an At Large Director electorate
that does not actually represent the legitimate interests of the
users of the DNS. Those who have been critical of the speed at
which this extremely difficult task has been undertaken do not,
with all due respect, appear to appreciate either the complexities
or the long-term importance to the consensus development process
of this effort.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In sum, the efforts to produce a fully-elected
ICANN Board have moved forward as expeditiously as could reasonably
be expected. By the time of its first annual meeting, half of
the elected Board members should be seated and active, and we
currently anticipate that the other half will be seated and active
no later than the end of the transition process contemplated by
the <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">White
Paper</A>. Given the difficulties involved, and the critical importance
of getting it right, this seems to be an acceptable pace. It is
ICANN's impression that the majority of the Internet community
agrees with both this analysis and the conclusions that flow from
it, but the Committee can obviously test this impression by seeking
input from the full range of participants.</FONT></P>

     FACE="Arial">2. A detailed explanation of ICANN's decision to
    deny the general public access to portions of its meetings and
    the meetings of its supporting organizations.</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In fact, all of the results of the ICANN
decision-making process, and much of the actual decision-making,
are fully accessible to the general public. No significant policy
matter can be considered by the Board without prior public notice
and consideration of public comments. The Board has in its first
two quarterly meetings (in Singapore and Berlin) divided its three-day
meetings into a public discussion of the Board agenda, complete
with reports from staff and others on the matters scheduled for
discussion and the opportunity for public comment and Board interaction;
a subsequent private Board discussion of those same agenda items;
and a public press conference, open to all, where the Board explains
its decisions and answers questions. Thus, the only activities
that have not been fully available to the general public have
been those Board meetings, in person and telephonically, when
staff is providing advice to the Board and responding to its questions;
any actions taken on those occasions are immediately made public,
along with the underlying rationale for the decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The criticism from some that ICANN is not
sufficiently accountable because its Board and staff engage in
non-public conversations, therefore, seems vastly overblown. The
notion that there should not be any private interaction between
a decision-making body and its staff, which is what this criticism
amounts to, would surprise most observers, probably including
this Committee and its staff. Obviously, like most public bodies,
the Congress operates in a highly visible mode, but this does
not preclude the private interaction between committees and their
staff which is necessary to effective operations. Similar private
interaction between the ICANN Board and its staff likewise does
not mean that the ICANN process is not an open one, as the combination
of required public notice and comment before any action and immediate
announcement of actions and their rationale demonstrates. Indeed,
since ICANN &quot;decisions&quot; are nothing more than the recognition
of community consensus, and require voluntary compliance by a
large number of independent actors to have any effect at all,
the notion that there is some &quot;secret&quot; process that
has any significance simply makes no sense in this context.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Still, this issue clearly is important --
probably as much to many of the critics as a matter of principle
as for its practical implications -- to a certain portion of the
Internet community. The Board would obviously like to take whatever
reasonable steps it could to allow the finite energy of the Board
and all the other participants in this process to concentrate
on consensus policy development, rather than this issue. Therefore,
it will continue to experiment with different combinations of
public and private sessions in its next meeting in Santiago, with
the goal of trying to properly balance the desire for full transparency
with the need to continue to more forward effectively with the
complex coordination tasks it has been handed.</FONT></P>

     FACE="Arial">3. A detailed explanation of ICANN's decision to
    seek authority solely over generic Top Level Domains (&quot;TLDs&quot;),
    and not over country code TLDs, many of which are commercial
    in nature and accept registration by all individuals.</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN has made no such decision. In fact,
outside of various preliminary discussions with NSI that have
not proven fruitful, ICANN has not engaged in any meaningful discussions
or negotiations with any TLD registries, whether gTLDs or ccTLDs.
The only actions that ICANN has undertaken to date are those which
are specified in the White Paper and the MOU, and specifically
those designed to introduce and facilitate competition for registration
services in the .com, .net and .org domains, which are by far
the most significant commercial domains.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It would obviously be desirable at some
point to have contractual relationships with both gTLD and ccTLD
registries, but given ICANN's extremely limited resources, that
issue is on the &quot;to do&quot; list, not the &quot;front burner&quot;
list. Of course, if and when ICANN is able to turn to the issue
of contracts with the registries, any such relationships will
only result from the voluntary agreement of the registry operators
to participate in and abide by the consensus development process
that is ICANN.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In response to a NSI suggestion, and because
the Board viewed it as an idea that had some merit, ICANN did
post for comments the question of whether, instead of DNSO constituencies
for &quot;gTLDs&quot; and &quot;ccTLDs,&quot; there should instead
be constituencies for &quot;open&quot; TLDs (those allowing registrations
by anyone) and &quot;closed&quot; TLDs (those placing geographic
or other restrictions on who could register a name in those registries).
The clear consensus of the responses was that this was not a desirable
approach at this time, and the Board has taken no further action
on this issue. It is an issue that is under consideration by the
Government Advisory Committee. Given that fact, and given ICANN's
extremely limited resources, it has focused on the specific immediate
tasks set forth in the White Paper and MOU, and will return to
this issue at some appropriate time in the future.</FONT></P>

    questions:</FONT></B></P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">d. Please provide all records related
      to the consideration and selection of each interim board member.</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The details of the contacts with each Director
are summarized below. To provide some context: As part of the
creation of the consensus structure that eventually became ICANN,
there was considerable discussion about how this new entity would
be managed. Since it was, by definition, intended to be a <B>global
</B>consensus entity, it was understood by all that its management
should be globally diverse. While there was considerable discussion
about how the permanent Board should be constituted, it was generally
understood that the Initial Board members would have to be produced
by the same consensus process that was to create the new entity
itself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In fact, that is what happened. Simultaneously
with the effort to develop a consensus organization, the entire
Internet community was invited to propose people who would be
suitable as Initial Board members. At first, the general view
seemed to be that the Initial Board should represent the various
stakeholders in the process -- those groups or coalitions that
were separately identified and had a specific interest to advance.
It quickly became clear that it was not going to be easy -- and
perhaps impossible -- to come to a consensus using this approach,
in part because the various stakeholders showed no propensity
for coming to consensus on their particular representative, and
in part because it was difficult to perceive a consensus on which
stakeholder groups should be represented on the Initial Board.
The focus then changed to finding what were referred to as &quot;luminaries&quot;
-- people of outstanding credentials and reputations who had not
been engaged in the debates and whom the Internet community would
recognize and support as both qualified and neutral.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Initial Board as it now stands is the
result of that latter effort, which was engaged in by numerous
people around the world. In addition to volunteered proposals,
<A HREF="http://www.postel.org/">Jon Postel</A> and <A HREF="http://www.iana.org/">IANA</A>
affirmatively sought out recommendations from the full range of
participants in the debate, including NSI. A number of people
who seemed to be attractive candidates were approached in various
ways and declined to be considered; others who were recommended
seemed inappropriate for a variety of reasons. After considerable
discussion, the current roster of Initial Board members was finally
reached. The original suggestions of those people who ultimately
came to serve on the Initial Board came from private individuals,
business organizations, trade associations, and officials of various
governmental organizations. The final decisions on who would be
invited were made by Jon Postel, after considering all the advice
and recommendations received and coming to a judgment that this
group of individuals was likely to receive consensus support from
the Internet community. The official invitations were issued on
behalf of Dr. Postel by his counsel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">With that preamble, the following summarizes
the details of the contacts that each individual director experienced:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">1. Geraldine Capdeboscq</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ms. Capdeboscq, who is the executive vice
president of the Group Bull (a French computer company) in charge
of its strategy, technology, and partnerships, was first contacted
in September, 1998, by a representative of the French Ministry
of Finance and Industry, asking whether she would be available
to serve on the board of a new international corporation to oversee
Internet addresses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">She indicated that, while she was an Internet
user, she had not been following or even aware of the discussions
on the creation of such a corporation. She was told the objective
for the Initial Board was to find qualified individuals who had
not previously been actively involved, but were interested, in
Internet development. She indicated her willingness to participate
in principle, and was then contacted by an official of the European
Commission, who asked her to indicate her willingness to be considered
to Jon Postel (through his counsel), which she did. She understood
that it was not clear that she would in fact be formally asked
to participate, since the consideration of the structure of the
Initial Board was still in process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">She became aware that she had been chosen
as a member of the Initial Board when she was contacted by Jon
Postel's counsel to arrange the details of a meeting of proposed
Initial Board members near New York City, during which meeting
the Initial Board was first constituted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Sometime last fall, Mr. Conrades received
a call on his car phone from John Patrick, whom he knew from working
together at IBM. Mr. Patrick asked him if he was familiar with
IANA and the effort to form a new private sector entity to take
over those responsibilities. Mr. Conrades said he was aware of
the effort. Mr. Patrick then told him that his name had been suggested
as a possible initial director of the entity, and asked if he
would be interested; Mr. Patrick said that the Global Internet
Project was supporting this effort, and that Mr. Conrades' background
and experience in the industry, combined with the fact that he
was no longer associated with any company, made him a particularly
good choice as a knowledgeable but neutral candidate. He then
suggested that Mr. Conrades call Roger Cochetti for more details,
which he did, and he subsequently agreed to let his name be submitted
to the USG. He then received a call from the counsel to Jon Postel,
who confirmed that his name would be submitted and discussed dates
for an initial meeting, which was held in October.</FONT></P>

in the Green Paper/White Paper process, he was contacted by a
representative of the Australian National Office for the Information
Economy (NOIE), who sought his advice on ACIF's processes as a
potential guide to the structure and processes of the new body
(NewCo) being discussed to serve as a private sector substitute
for the historical government management of various functions.
In addition, he was asked if he would be prepared to stand as
an initial director of NewCo should it be established. He agreed
in principle, subject to further details.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Crew's name had been submitted as a
possible candidate for an ICANN Director by both the NOIE and
at least one Australian private sector member, based on personal
contact with him in his role as Chairman of ACIF. In September
1998, he was contacted by counsel to Jon Postel, by telephone,
to confirm his willingness to stand as a director of ICANN, and
he agreed to do so. Subsequently, he was invited, and during October
attended, a meeting of proposed initial directors of ICANN near
New York City.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ms. Dyson originally discussed this subject
separately with Ira Magaziner and Roger Cochetti in late summer
1998. Both told her of the impending formation of a new organization
to manage certain aspects of domain name policy, and asked her
if she would have any interest in serving on the board of such
an entity. She said she would be interested. In mid-September,
she received an e-mail from counsel for Jon Postel, asking her
to serve on the board; since she did not know this person, she
contacted Roger Cochetti to ask him if this was legitimate. He
told her it was, and she subsequently agreed to be included on
the list of proposed board members submitted to the USG. She then
attended a meeting in October, at which the Board was officially
constituted and she was elected Interim Chairman.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">5. Frank Fitzsimmons</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Fitzsimmons was first contacted by another
Dun &amp; Bradstreet employee, who told him about the effort to
create a private sector organization to assume certain Internet
management functions. He was told that his background and experience
on Internet and electronic commerce issues made him a potentially
attractive candidate for the initial board of this new entity.
He suggested that other D&amp;B personnel working for him might
be more knowledgeable, but was told that senior-level people were
being sought. It was suggested that Mr. Fitzsimmons call the counsel
for Jon Postel to get more information, which he did. After learning
more about the effort, he agreed to be considered, and after clearing
this with his senior management and legal staff, agreed to have
his name included in the proposal to be submitted to the Commerce
Department.</FONT></P>

  <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">6. Hans Kraaijenbrink</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Sometime in mid-1998, he received a telephone
call from an official of the European Commission, asking whether
he would be available to serve on the Board of a new international
corporation to oversee certain parameters of the Internet. The
fact that he had not previously been involved in these issues
was explained to him as a positive instead of a negative point,
since it meant that he would approach the issues with an open
mind. He was also told that his experience as the Chair of the
Executive Board of the Association of the European Telecommunications
Network Operators (ETNO) was one of the reasons that he had been
approached, since it demonstrated his capacity to serve effectively
on the board of international organizations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">After consultation with and approval by
the Executive Board of ETNO and his employer Royal KPN N.V., he
indicated his willingness to be considered. He was subsequently
contacted by counsel for Jon Postel to inform him of his selection
to the Initial Board and to arrange the practical details of a
meeting of all such Initial Board members, which took place in
the New York area in late October, 1998.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Murai was contacted by Jon Postel at
either an IETF or ISOC meeting, who asked him if he would have
any interest in serving on the initial board of the private sector
successor to IANA. He then received either a phone call or an
email from Jon Postel's counsel asking him if he was agreeable
to having his name submitted to the Department of Commerce. He
agreed.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">8. Eugenio Triana</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Triana was originally suggested as a
possible candidate by various Europeans who were aware that he
would, on September 1, 1998, be leaving his post with the European
Commission. Sometime after that time, he was asked by various
people who participate in European and Spanish associations dealing
with information technology and telecommunications whether he
would be interested in serving on the board of a new non-profit
organization intended to have some Internet management responsibilities.
He agreed to be considered. Sometime after that, toward the end
of September, he received a communication from counsel to Jon
Postel, providing further information and asking if he would agree
to be proposed as part of the Initial Board, which he did. He
subsequently attended the organizational meeting of the Initial
Board in October.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">9. Linda S. Wilson</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ms. Wilson was first contacted by Professor
Larry Landweber of the University of Wisconsin. He informed her
of the planning underway to create a non-profit organization to
manage various technical aspects of the Internet, and told her
that exploration had begun for potential candidates to serve on
an initial board that would serve for a short period of time to
get the process started. He said that her name had surfaced from
several sources as someone who might be interested and willing,
and that the President of the University of Wisconsin (where Ms.
Wilson received her PhD) has encouraged him to contact her. She
was interested because of prior experience in shaping new and
reinvented organizations, because of interest in the Internet,
and because it seemed to be a valuable public service. She did
indicate, however, that she had a complex year ahead of her in
her role as President of Radcliffe College, and that the timing
and commitment would be very relevant factors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">She was contacted again (she believes in
early September) by either Landweber or Mike Roberts, who told
her that progress was being made, and asked again if she would
be willing to serve. She said she was interested but still concerned
about the level of commitment required given her other obligations.
Subsequently, she was contacted by counsel for Jon Postel, who
asked for a current resume. Finally, Jon Postel's counsel contacted
her once again, with a request that she allow her name to be formally
proposed in a filing with the Department of Commerce. She agreed,
with the understanding that she was agreeing to serve on the Board.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">10. Michael M. Roberts</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The other member of the Initial Board is
Michael M. Roberts, ICANN's Interim President and Chief Executive
Officer, who serves <I>ex officio</I>. Mr. Roberts was first contacted
in the early fall by counsel to Jon Postel, who asked him if he
would be willing to be considered for the post of the Interim
CEO of ICANN. After some discussion of why he might be suited
for that position -- including importantly his experience with
the issues and his immediate availability -- and being told that
it would probably be only a short-term assignment (perhaps a few
months), Mr. Roberts agreed to be considered. He was then invited
to attend a meeting of the Initial Board in October, where he
was extensively interviewed by the Board and then excused from
the room so his candidacy could be discussed. He was then told
that the Board, after consideration of several alternatives, had
voted to offer him the position, with the details of the employment
arrangements to be negotiated between him and the Interim Chairman.
He serves at the pleasure of the Board pursuant to a month-to-month
contract.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When ICANN was officially recognized by
the USG (through the signing of the <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/icann-memorandum.htm">MOU</A>)
as the global, consensus, non-profit organization that the <A
HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm">White
Paper</A> had called upon the Internet community to produce, both
parties assumed that the organizational process could move ahead
expeditiously, and that a permanent cost-recovery mechanism would
be in place in the foreseeable future. In fact, the organizational
process has been both more complex and slower than was anticipated,
and a regularized cost-recovery funding mechanism has just this
month become effective. Since the largest registrar has so far
refused to become accredited, however, and thus is not yet participating
in the cost recovery process, the current cost recovery program
will not likely cover ICANN's ongoing costs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In order to bridge the period between its
creation and the operation of a regularized cost recovery mechanism,
ICANN solicited, and various individuals and entities volunteered,
donations that would be used to cover this transition period.
The <A HREF="http://www.gip.org/">Global Internet Project</A>
undertook to lead a fund-raising effort on behalf of ICANN throughout
the business community, and ICANN officers and Directors encouraged
donations at every appropriate opportunity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The result of all of these efforts was a
total of $421,510 in donations; the amount of each donation and
the identity of the donor are recorded on Attachment 9 to this
response.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Unfortunately, in significant part because
of the longer time and greater costs of the transition period,
as described elsewhere in this response, the amount of donations
has not kept pace with expenses, so that ICANN is currently in
a significant negative net worth position. Its total revenues
are significantly exceeded by its total expenses; the accounts
payable consist in significant part of professional services.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN is now beginning to receive some funds
for cost recovery from direct participants in the DNS. It has
received approximately $110,000 in application and accreditation
fees from registrars, and beginning July 1, 1999, it is accruing
fees from accredited registrars pursuant to the cost recovery
funding mechanism described earlier in this response. Nevertheless,
until a resolution of the current impasse with NSI, ICANN will
continue to rely on donations and the willingness of its creditors
to forego immediate payment for the bulk of its funding. This
is obviously not a viable long-term situation; if the ICANN mechanism
for consensus policy development is to be successful, it must
begin to receive a more regular flow of funds to recover its continuing
costs.</FONT></P>

In fact, in <A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/docnsi100698.htm">Amendment
11</A>, NSI agreed to support the transition of USG DNS responsibilities
to &quot;NewCo,&quot; (now ICANN), agreed to &quot;recognize NewCo
pursuant to a contract between NSI and NewCo, and agreed that
ICANN would have &quot;the authority . . . to carry out [ICANN's]
responsibilities.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT><A NAME="#Footnote4"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">[4]
Prior to the current arrangement, the services were funded by
the USG and free to all users wherever located.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT><A NAME="#Footnote5"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">[5]
To obtain the $70 fee, registrants must supply various technical
information that many non-commercial (and probably many commercial)
registrants would not likely have available. If that information
is not available to the registrant, it would have to choose the
alternative fee of $119, for which NSI obtains the necessary technical
information. It is likely that a large portion of those registering
names with NSI choose the $119 alternative; NSI does not release
a breakdown that would confirm this assumption.</FONT></P>

<A HREF="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/docnsi100698.htm">Amendment
11</A> requires NSI to charge a registry fee that is no more than
its &quot;costs and a reasonable return on its investment.&quot;
Since NSI and the USG have been unable to come to an agreement
on what that fee should be, they have temporarily agreed that
NSI may charge a fee of $9 per annual registration. Since NSI
has refused to accept any registrations from other registrars
that are not for a period of at least two years, each registration
by a competing registrar produces a payment of $18 to NSI. Noting
several solicitations for the operation of these registries that
have recently been submitted to the U.S. Department of Commerce,
some observers have estimated that the actual cost of operating
the .com, .net, and .org registries is likely to be no more than
$2/year for each domain name registered. Even assuming that estimate
is low by as much as 100%, it seems reasonable to expect that
the fee that NSI will eventually be permitted to charge for accessing
the registries that it operates will be significantly lower than
the $9 temporary charge that is now permitted.</FONT></P>

Current Directors should also receive similar reimbursement, but
in the absence of a permanent cost recovery mechanism, most of
those expenses have not in fact been reimbursed (and in many cases,
reimbursement has not yet been requested).</FONT></P>

The IP Address Registries are in the process of forming the Address
Supporting Organization, which (as is the case with each of ICANN's
three Supporting Organizations) will elect three members of the
ICANN Board once it is in existence. The three regional address
registries have all indicated a willingness and intention to contract
with ICANN and to provide an equitable portion of the funds needed
for the recovery of ICANN's costs once the ASO is formally recognized.</FONT></P>
