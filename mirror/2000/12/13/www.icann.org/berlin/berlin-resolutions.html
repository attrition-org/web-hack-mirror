<P>After the Berlin meetings, ICANN released a <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/berlin/berlin-press-rel.htm">press
communiqu&eacute;</A> prepared and distributed by Alexander Ogilvy,
ICANN's communications advisers. The press communiqu&eacute; attempts
to put the Board's decisions in a comprehensible context for a
wide audience; however, readers are reminded that the Board's
actual decisions are fully and authoritatively embodied only in
its resolutions, and in the approved minutes of its meetings.</P>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><A NAME="1"></A><B>Resolution on DNSO Constituencies</B></P>

<P>The Board discussed the applications received to date from
groups desiring to form Constituencies of the Domain Names Supporting
Organization. After consideration, the Board unanimously adopted
the following resolutions.</P>

<P>RESOLVED, that the following Constituencies (as defined in
Article VI-B of the Bylaws) are provisionally recognized until
the annual meeting of the Board in 1999, to operate in accordance
with the proposals received by the Corporation and ordered attached
to these minutes:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><BR>
  ccTLD registries <BR>
  Commercial and business entities <BR>
  gTLD registries <BR>
  Intellectual property <BR>
  ISPs and connectivity providers <BR>
  Registrars</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President of the Corporation is
directed to work with the Constituencies to amend their proposals
to address deficiencies noted by the Board, which amended proposals
must include a commitment of the submitting Constituency to hold
a new election of Names Council representatives promptly following
the approval by the Board of such amended proposal.</P>

<P>FURTHER RESOLVED, that, when such proposals are so amended,
the Board should examine such proposals to determine whether the
deficiencies have been satisfactorily addressed and whether to
extend the recognition today made.</P>

<P>FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Names Council representatives chosen
by the provisionally recognized Constituencies shall constitute
the provisional Names Council, with all the powers set forth in
the Bylaws other than the selection of Directors (pursuant to
Section 2(e) of Article VI-B of the Bylaws), which selection powers
will be deferred until such time as the Board determines it has
made sufficient final recognitions.</P>

<P>FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board requests that the Constituency
for gTLD registries agree, for so long as Network Solutions is
the only participant in such Constituency, to select only one
individual (rather than three) to represent that Constituency
on the provisional Names Council, and the Board states that if
such Constituency does not agree to make only one such selection,
the Board will amend the Bylaws to effectuate such goal.</P>

<P>FURTHER RESOLVED, that the phrase &quot;except with the consent
of the Board&quot; shall be inserted after the twenty-first word
of Section 3(c) of Article VI-B of the Bylaws.</P>

<P>FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board considers geographic diversity
to be an important requirement that should be met promptly, but
consents to waiver of the Names Council geographic diversity requirement
of Article VI-B(3)(c) of the Bylaws, for the period of provisional
recognition only.</P>

<P>FURTHER RESOLVED, the Board determines that no proposal to
create a non-commercial domain name holders Constituency has yet
been submitted that is appropriate for recognition.</P>

<P>FURTHER RESOLVED, with the recognition that the interests represented
by a non-commercial domain name holders Constituency should be
involved as early as possible in the DNSO organization process,
the Board urges that the organizers of this Constituency should
submit a consensus application for provisional recognition as
soon as possible, so that the issue of recognition can be reconsidered
by the Board no later than an anticipated meeting during the week
of June 21 so that representatives of this Constituency can join
the provisional Names Council. <HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="2"></A><B></B></P>

<P><B>Resolution on Report of World Intellectual Property Organization</B></P>

<P>WHEREAS, in the White Paper the U.S. Government called on the
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to develop recommendations
regarding trademark disputes concerning domain names;</P>

<P>WHEREAS, on April 30, 1999, WIPO submitted a report to the
ICANN Board containing numerous recommendations that resulted
from an extensive consultative process;</P>

<P>WHEREAS, the first ICANN-accredited registrars (testbed registrars),
are preparing to introduce competition in the provision of domain
registration services and accordingly are required soon to implement
dispute resolution policies;</P>

<P>RESOLVED, the ICANN Board commends the WIPO on its report,
which the ICANN Board finds represents a substantial and positive
contribution to the analysis and discussion of issues concerning
the relationship between the domain-name system and intellectual
property rights;</P>

<P>FURTHER RESOLVED, the ICANN Board notes that most of the recommendations
in Chapter 2 of the WIPO report relating to best practices for
registrars are closely similar to many of the elements of the
Statement of Registrar Accreditation Policy adopted by the Board
on March 4, 1999 and that the provisions of that policy are scheduled
for review by the Board in the first half of 2000;</P>

<P>FURTHER RESOLVED, the ICANN Board endorses the principle that
a uniform dispute resolution policy should be adopted for Registrars
in the .com, .net, and .org Top-Level Domains (TLDs);</P>

<P>FURTHER RESOLVED, the ICANN Board encourages the testbed registrars
to work together to formulate a model dispute resolution policy
for voluntary adoption and directs the President to provide information
and similar assstance to the testbed registrars in this regard;</P>

<P>FURTHER RESOLVED, the ICANN Board refers the recommendations
in Chapter 3 of the WIPO report (with associated annexes) to the
ICANN Domain Name Supporting Organization (DNSO) for the recommendations
of the DNSO, to be submitted to the ICANN Board by July 31, 1999;</P>

<P>FURTHER RESOLVED, the ICANN Board requests that by July 31,
1999 the DNSO submit to the Board any other recommendations the
DNSO may have concerning a uniform dispute resolution policy for
registrars in the .com, .net, and .org TLDs;</P>

<P>FURTHER RESOLVED, the ICANN Board requests all persons desiring
to make written comments concerning a uniform dispute resolution
policy for registrars in the .com, .net, and .org TLDs to submit
those comments by August 20, 1999, in advance of the Board's meeting
scheduled for August 24-26, 1999 in Santiago, at which time Board
action on such a policy is hereby scheduled; and</P>

<P>FURTHER RESOLVED, the ICANN Board refers the recommendations
in Chapters 4 and 5 (with associated annexes) of the WIPO report
to the ICANN DNSO for recommendations on the topics of those chapters,
to be submitted to the ICANN Board at the earliest practicable
time after the Board's meeting scheduled for August 24-26, 1999
in Santiago. <HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="3"></A></P>

<P><B>Resolution on At-Large Membership</B></P>

<P>WHEREAS, the Board has received and reviewed the Commentary
on the Principles of the At-Large Membership from the Membership
Advisory Committee;</P>

<P>WHEREAS, the Board recognizes the significant contribution
to the discussion and evaluation of the process of establishing
the ICANN At-Large Membership made by the MAC, expresses its deep
appreciation for the personal sacrifices that effort required,
and accepts the retirement of the current members of the MAC;</P>

<P>WHEREAS, the Board has also considered the public comments
submitted via the Internet and at the Singapore and Berlin open
meetings;</P>

<P>WHEREAS, the Board reaffirms its intention to establish, as
soon as practicable, a system that permits individuals to select
geographically diverse At-Large Directors, but also recognizes
that this effort, given the unique context of a new form of global
consensus organization with responsibility for oversight of an
important global resource, is likely to be both administratively
complex and expensive (especially in relation to ICANN's anticipated
budget);</P>

<P>WHEREAS the Board believes that the cost of implementing an
At-Large membership and election process should primarily be borne
by that membership;</P>

<P>WHEREAS, the Board also reaffirms its intention to implement
an At-Large election process that supports the principal responsibility
of ICANN, which is to preserve the operational stability of the
Internet, and thus to implement any such process over a transitional
period that will permit any adjustments to the process determined
to be necessary to meet this commitment;</P>

<P>NOW THEREFORE, the Board directs staff to review the MAC Commentary
and report back to the Board before the Santiago meeting on the
administrative requirements, likely cost, and logistical details
of an election process responsive to the MAC Commentary.</P>

<P>AND FURTHER, the Board directs counsel to report to it before
the Santiago meeting on the legal implications of an election
process responsive to the MAC commentary.</P>

<P>AND FURTHER, the Board directs staff to recommend to the Board
a process for repopulating the MAC, so that it can advise the
Board on promotion and encouragement of membership and solicitation
of sponsorship for outreach programs. <HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="4"></A></P>

<P><B>Resolution on Protocol Supporting Organization</B></P>

<P>WHEREAS the Board of Directors has received the proposal for
a Protocol Supporting Organization submitted on April 23, 1999;
and</P>

<P>WHEREAS the community of open, international, voluntary, Internet-related
technical standard and technical specification development organizations
has expressed its consensus support for the proposal;</P>

<P>BE IT RESOLVED that the Board accepts the proposal for a Protocol
Supporting Organization submitted on April 23, 1999, and authorizes
and directs the President to prepare implementing Bylaws, and
to sign an appropriate Memorandum of Understanding in cooperation
with the proponents of the proposal, subject to ratification by
the Board. <HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="5"></A></P>

<P><B>Resolution on Independent Review</B></P>

<P>WHEREAS the Board of Directors has received and considered
the Interim Report and Draft Principles submitted by the Advisory
Committee on Independent Review on May 7, 1999, along with the
Addendum to the Interim Report submitted on May 26, 1999; and</P>

<P>WHEREAS the Board has reviewed and considered the public comments
submitted via the Internet and at the Berlin open meeting;</P>

<P>BE IT RESOLVED that the Board (1) accepts the Draft Principles,
as amended by the Addendum; (2) states its preference for option
(c) to Draft Principle 9 set forth in the Addendum; and (3) requests
that the Advisory Committee on Independent Review complete and
submit its final report and recommendations by August 10, 1999;
and</P>

<P>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Board thanks the Advisory Committee
on Independent Review for its hard and productive work so far.
<HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="6"></A></P>

<P><B>Resolution on ICANN Bylaws relating to Governmental Advisory
Committee</B></P>

<P>WHEREAS the Board has received the Operating Principles adopted
by the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC); and</P>

<P>WHEREAS the GAC has requested that the Board conform the applicable
Bylaws to the membership criteria established in the Operating
Principles;</P>

<P>BE IT RESOLVED that Article VII, Sec. 3(a) of the Bylaws be
amended to replace the third sentence with the following:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
