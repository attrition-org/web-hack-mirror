<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Background</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Domain names are the human-friendly form
of Internet addresses. While designed to serve the function of
enabling users to locate computers in an easy manner, domain names
have acquired a further significance as business identifiers and,
as such, have come into conflict with the system of business identifiers
that existed before the arrival of the Internet and that are protected
by intellectual property rights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The tension between domain names, on the
one hand, and intellectual property rights, on the other hand,
have led to numerous problems that raise challenging policy questions.
These policy questions have new dimensions that are a consequence
of the intersection of a global, multipurpose medium, the Internet,
with systems designed for the physical, territorial world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">On the proposal of the Government of the
United States of America, and with the approval of its Member
States, WIPO has since July 1998 undertaken an extensive international
process of consultations (&quot;the WIPO Process&quot;). The purpose
of the WIPO Process was to make recommendations to the corporation
established to manage the domain name system, the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), on certain questions arising
out of the interface between domain names and intellectual property
rights. Seventeen consultation meetings were held in 15 different
cities throughout the world in the course of the WIPO Process,
and written submissions were received from 266 governments, intergovernmental
organizations, professional associations, corporation and individuals.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">An Interim Report containing draft recommendations
was issued in December 1998 as part of the WIPO Process. The present
document constitutes the Final Report. It is being submitted to
ICANN and to the Member States of WIPO. The main recommendations
in the Final Report are summarized below.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Best Practices for Registration Authorities</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(i) The adoption of a number of improved,
standard practices for registrars with authority to register domain
names in the generic top-level domains (gTLDs) will reduce the
tension that exists between domain names and intellectual property
rights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(ii) In particular, the collection and availability
of accurate and reliable contact details of domain name holders
is an essential tool for facilitating the protection of intellectual
property rights on a borderless and otherwise anonymous medium.
Such contact details provide the principal means by which intellectual
property owners can go about the process of enforcing their rights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(iii) Where it is shown that contact details
are inaccurate and unreliable and that contact cannot be established
with a domain name holder through them, a third party should have
the right to serve a notification to this effect on the responsible
registrar. Upon independent verification of the impossibility
of establishing contact, the registrar should be required to cancel
the domain name registration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(iv) In the WIPO Interim Report, it was
suggested that consideration be given to the introduction of a
non-commercial, use-restricted domain, where the contact details
of domain name holders would not be publicly available, as a means
of allaying the concerns of those who consider that the public
availability of contact details may lead to intrusions of privacy.
In the Final Report, it is concluded that this idea requires further
consideration, elaboration and consultation in a separate process
before any recommendation can made on it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Administrative Procedure Concerning Abusive
Domain Name Registrations</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(v) ICANN should adopt a dispute-resolution
policy under which an administrative dispute-resolution procedure
is made available for domain name disputes in all gTLDs. In the
Interim Report, it was recommended that domain name applicants
should be required to submit to the procedure in respect of any
intellectual property dispute arising out of a domain name registration.
The Final Report recommends that the scope of the administrative
procedure be limited to cases of bad faith, abusive registration
of domain names that violate trademark rights (&quot;cybersquatting,&quot;
in popular terminology). Domain name holders would thus be required
to submit to the administrative procedure only in respect of allegations
that they are involved in cybersquatting, which was universally
condemned throughout the WIPO Process as an indefensible activity
that should be suppressed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(vi) The administrative procedure would
be quick, efficient, cost-effective and conducted to a large extent
on-line. Determinations under it would be limited to orders for
the cancellation or transfer of domain name registrations and
the allocation of the costs of the procedure (not including attorneys&#146;
fees) against the losing party. Determinations would be enforced
by registration authorities under the dispute-resolution policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Exclusions for Famous and Well-known
Marks</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(vii) Famous and well-known marks have been
the special target of predatory and parasitical practices on the
part of a small, but active, minority of domain name registrants.
A mechanism should be introduced whereby the owner of a famous
or well-known mark can obtain an exclusion in some or all gTLDs
for the name of the mark where the mark is famous or well-known
on a widespread geographical basis and across different classes
of goods or services. The effect of the exclusion would be to
prohibit any person other than the owner of the famous or well-known
mark from registering the mark as a domain name.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(viii) The exclusion mechanism gives expression
in cyberspace to the special protection that is established for
famous and well-known marks in the Paris Convention for the Protection
of Industrial Property and the TRIPS Agreement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(ix) Since an exclusion would cover only
the exact name of the famous or well-known mark, and since experience
shows that cybersquatters typically register many close variations
of famous or well-known marks, an exclusion, once granted, should
give rise to an evidentiary presumption in the administrative
procedure. The effect of the evidentiary presumption would to
place the burden of proving justification for the use of a domain
name on the domain name holder where the domain name is identical
or misleadingly similar to the famous or well-known mark and the
domain name is being used in a way that is likely to damage the
interests of the owner of the mark.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">New gTLDs</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(x) The evidence shows that the experience
of the last five years in gTLDs has led to numerous instances
of abusive domain name registrations and, consequently, to consumer
confusion and an undermining of public trust in the Internet.
It has also led to the necessity for intellectual property owners
to invest substantial human and financial resources in defending
their interests. This arguably wasteful diversion of economic
resources can be averted by the adoption of the improved registration
practices, administrative dispute-resolution procedure and exclusion
mechanism recommended in the Final Report of the WIPO Process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(xi) In view of past experience, intellectual
property owners are very apprehensive about the introduction of
new gTLDs and the possible repetition in the new gTLDs of that
experience.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(xii) Many issues other than intellectual
property protection are involved in the formulation of a policy
on the introduction of new gTLDs. Insofar as intellectual property
is concerned, it is believed that the introduction of new gTLDs
may be envisaged on the condition that the recommendations of
the WIPO Final Report with respect to improved registration practices,
dispute resolution and an exclusion mechanism for famous and well-known
marks are adopted, and on the further condition that any new gTLDs
are introduced in a slow and controlled manner that allows for
experience with the new gTLDs to be monitored and evaluated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">First Steps and Outstanding Issues</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The recommendations of the Final Report
of the WIPO Process have been directed at the most egregious problems
between intellectual property and domain names and at obtaining
effective solutions to those problems. Other issues remain outstanding
and require further reflection and consultation. Amongst these
other issues are:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(a) as signaled above, the exploration of
the feasibility of introducing a non-commercial, use-restricted
domain where contact details of domain name holders might not
be readily available publicly;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(b) the problem of bad faith, abusive domain
name registrations that violate intellectual property rights other
than trademarks or service marks, for example, geographical indications
and personality rights;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(c) the problem of bad faith, abusive domain
name registrations of the names and acronyms of international
intergovernmental organizations that are protected against use
and registration as trademarks by the Paris Convention; and</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(d) the problem of bad faith, abusive domain
name registrations of International Nonproprietary Names selected
by the World Health Organization for the identification of specific
pharmaceutical substances under single, globally available names
in order to protect the safety of patients.</FONT>
