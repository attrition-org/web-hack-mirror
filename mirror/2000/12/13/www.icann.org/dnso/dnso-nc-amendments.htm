  <P><font face="Arial">The following proposed Amendments to the ICANN Bylaws 
    are intended to implement an evident consensus among participants in the ICANN 
    process that no single company should be able to place more than one representative 
    on the Names Council of the <A href="http://www.dnso.org/">Domain Name Supporting 
    Organization</A> (DNSO). Contrary to the request of the ICANN Board, the gTLD 
    registry of the DNSO (which currently has only one corporation as a member) 
    has declined to name only one member of the Names Council, and, instead, has 
    submitted three names. At its Berlin public meeting, the clear sentiment of 
    the attendees and online participants was that the ICANN Bylaws should be 
    amended to prohibit a constituency from naming more members of the Names Council 
    than there are members of the constituency. Correspondence relating to this 
    situation can be found at <A 
href="http://www.icann.org/correspondence/correspondence.htm">http://www.icann.org/correspondence/correspondence.htm</A>.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial">The Internet community is invited to make comments on 
    the proposed Amendments. </font></P>
