      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">For several years, there have been proposals
      to introduce new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) into the Internet
      Domain Name System (DNS). Although the introduction of gTLDs
      raises several issues that are of concern to various members
      of the Internet community, significant progress has been made
      recently toward achieving a consensus solution. The ICANN Board
      of Directors is expected to consider adopting a policy to introduce
      new gTLDs at its meeting on 15-16 July 2000 in Yokohama, Japan.</FONT></P>

      </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">The DNS employs top-level domains
      consisting of two general types. Two-letter codes (such as .de,
      .jp, and .uk) are used to represent the names of countries and
      territories and are referred to as country-code top-level domains,
      or simply &quot;ccTLDs.&quot; Longer codes are referred to as
      gTLDs. Presently these longer codes are .com, .net, .org, .edu,
      .int, .mil, and .gov. (One other top-level domain, .arpa, is
      used for for Internet-infrastructure purposes.)</FONT></P>

       FACE="Arial"> For several years, there have been proposals to
      implement additional gTLDs in the DNS. These proposals have ranged
      from adding a few gTLDs to several hundred. Different types of
      gTLDs have been discussed, ranging from gTLDs available for registrations
      by any person or organization for any use (&quot;unrestricted
      gTLDs&quot;) to gTLDs intended for registrations by particular
      types of persons or organizations or for particular uses (&quot;chartered
      gTLDs&quot;). Because no new gTLD has been added for many years,
      concerns have been raised that their introduction might disrupt
      the operation of the Internet or the domain-name registration
      system.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The US Government's June 1998 <A HREF="../general/white-paper-05jun98.htm">White 
          Paper</A>, which proposed transitioning the Government's responsibilities 
          for technical coordination of the Internet to a private-sector not-for-profit 
          corporation (now ICANN), noted that the private-sector coordinating 
          corporation should ultimately have the authority necessary to oversee 
          policy for determining the circumstances under which new TLDs are added 
          to the root system. The White Paper noted, however, that:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">At least in the short run, a prudent concern
        for the stability of the system suggests that expansion of gTLDs
        proceed at a deliberate and controlled pace to allow for evaluation
        of the impact of the new gTLDs and well-reasoned evolution of
        the domain space. New top level domains could be created to enhance
        competition and to enable the new corporation to evaluate the
        functioning, in the new environment, of the root server system
        and the software systems that enable shared registration.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">On 30 April 1999, the World Intellectual
      Property Organization, which at the request of the US Government
      had conducted a study of intellectual-property issues in connection
      with the DNS and proposals for its evolution, submitted a report
      to the ICANN Board of Directors. That report <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/wipo/wipo-report-5.htm#343">concluded</A>
      that, on the condition that various measures were adopted to
      protect intellectual-property rights, new gTLDs could be introduced,
      provided that they were introduced in a slow and controlled manner
      that takes into account the efficacy of the proposed measures
      in reducing existing problems. Among these measures was a proposed
      mechanism for protecting globally famous names in any new gTLDs.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">At its meeting in Berlin on 27 May 1999,
      the ICANN Board <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-27may99.htm#99.48">referred</A>
      the issues of gTLD expansion and globally famous trademarks to
      the newly formed ICANN Domain Name Supporting Organization (DNSO).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">On 25 June 1999, the DNSO Names Council
      (which manages the process for development of policy recommendations
      within the DNSO) <A HREF="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/notes/19990625.NCmeet.html">created</A>
      a group, known as <A HREF="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/notes/19990625.NCwgc.html">Working
      Group C</A>, to study the issues raised by the introduction of
      new gTLDs. The Names Council also created another group, known
      as Working Group B, to study issues concerning the protection
      of famous trademarks in the context of any newly introduced gTLDs.</FONT></P>

      HREF="http://www.icann.org/dnso/new-gtlds-01apr00.htm">posted

      <P><CENTER><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">DNSO Names Council Statement
      on New gTLDs</FONT></U></B></CENTER></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Names Council determines that the report
        of Working Group C and related comments indicate that there exists
        a consensus for the introduction of new gTLDs in a measured and
        responsible manner. The Names Council therefore recommends to
        the ICANN Board that it establish a policy for the introduction
        of new gTLDs in a measured and responsible manner, giving due
        regard in the implementation of that policy to (a) promoting
        orderly registration of names during the initial phases; (b)
        minimizing the use of gTLDs to carry out infringements of intellectual
        property rights; and (c) recognizing the need for ensuring user
        confidence in the technical operation of the new TLD and the
        DNS as a whole.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Because there is no recent experience in
        introducing new gTLDs, we recommend to the Board that a limited
        number of new top-level domains be introduced initially and that
        the future introduction of additional top-level domains be done
        only after careful evaluation of the initial introduction. The
        Names Council takes note of the fact that the WG C report indicates
        that several types of domains should be considered in the initial
        introduction, these being: fully open top-level domains, restricted
        and chartered top-level domains with limited scope, non-commercial
        domains and personal domains. Implementation should promote competition
        in the domain-name registration business at the registry and
        registrar levels. The Names Council recognizes that any roll-out
        must not jeopardize the stability of the Internet, and assumes
        a responsible process for introducing new gTLDs, which includes
        ensuring that there is close coordination with organizations
        dealing with Internet protocols and standards.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">To assist the Board in the task of introducing
        new gTLDs, the Names Council recommends that the ICANN staff
        invite expressions of interest from parties seeking to operate
        any new gTLD registry, with an indication as to how they propose
        to ensure to promote these values.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">We would like to extend our deep appreciation
        to the substantial number of participants who worked so diligently
        in Working Groups B and C, and want to thank them for their significant
        efforts in evaluating the issues that were referred to them.
        Recognizing the Working Group C has recently approved additional
        principles and that Working Group B's formal report was provided
        to us yesterday, we advise the Board that we will be providing
        supplemental recommendations in the near future.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

       FACE="Arial">.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> As just noted,
      the Names Council expects that during the week of 15 May 2000
      it will provide supplemental recommendations to the ICANN Board.
      One possible topic of supplemental recommendations concerns the
      formal report of Working Group B, concerning procedures for addressing
      trademark issues that may arise during the initial phase of registrations
      in a new gTLD. The Names Council invites the Internet community
      to comment on this report until 10 May 2000, so that it may consider
      the comments in formulating any supplemental recommendations
      that it may adopt. You can read Working Group B's formal report
