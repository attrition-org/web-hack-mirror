      Now that ICANN has completed the <A HREF="http://members.icann.org/">At
      Large membership and election process</A> in the year 2000, it
      is time to launch a comprehensive study of the At Large concept,
      structure, and mechanisms. After discussions with many individuals
      who have been involved in the At Large effort, the ICANN staff
      made a set of recommendations about how the study might be organized,
      emphasizing the need for an effort that is effective, credible,
      and open to broad participation. At its recent meeting in Los
      Angeles, the ICANN Board <A HREF="../minutes/prelim-report-16nov00.htm#AtLargeMembershipStudy">called
      for public comments on the staff recommendations</A> -- key issues
      include the study's structure, composition, timetable, and funding.</FONT></P>

        and encourage the participation of organizations worldwide, and
        shall be a &quot;clean sheet&quot; study -- meaning that previous
        decisions and conclusions regarding an &quot;At Large&quot; membership
        will be informative but not determinative, and that the study
        will start with no preconceptions as to a preferred outcome.

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Because of the volume of work required
      by the TLD application process, the staff has not until now been
      able to produce a suggested template for the At Large study called
      for by Section 5. What follows is a suggested approach based
      on the staff's best judgment of the kind of study that has the
      potential to produce the desired result: a solution to this problem
      that will enjoy broad consensus support throughout the Internet
      community.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">I. Context.</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">For the benefit of those who have not followed
      this issue closely, it may be useful to set forth the following
      explanation, so as to place the staff recommendation in proper
      context.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN is a consensus development body.
      Its <A HREF="../support-orgs.htm">Supporting
      Organizations</A> are charged with the development of policy
      recommendations in their respective areas of expertise. ICANN's
      mission is narrowly (and properly) circumscribed, but even within
      those boundaries its actions can affect in various ways the whole
      community of Internet users. Thus, it has been assumed from the
      time of ICANN's creation that there must be some mechanism for
      the Internet community as a whole to provide input and accountability
      to ICANN -- and to help to more broadly legitimize the decisions
      and actions of what is a unique non-governmental organization.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The method by which this participation
      should take place has been the subject of quite contentious debate
      since even before the creation of ICANN. Notwithstanding very
      considerable discussion and analysis inside and outside ICANN
      over the two years since ICANN was created, it is apparent that
      there is still today no general consensus on this issue among
      the broad Internet community.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">II. The Problem is Complex, but its
      Solution is Essential to Continued Progress by ICANN. </FONT></B><FONT
       FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
      Within the Internet community, there are a range of very diverse
      views on how ICANN should be structured and operated, ranging
      from an emphasis by some on broad global democratic procedures
      to other views that favor leaving ICANN to be governed by those
      with the requisite expertise over what are described as the narrow
      technical and administrative tasks of ICANN. In addition, there
      are serious mechanical issues; no matter where on the policy
      spectrum one falls, all participants in the debate are interested
      in avoiding fraud, abuse or capture by determined minorities.
      Even this brief and very general statement of the issues illustrates
      how complex this problem is, and explains why arriving at a consensus
      solution has proven to be extremely difficult. <BR>
<BR>
      Still, no matter how difficult the problem, it must be solved.
      ICANN depends for its success and ultimately its existence on
      the voluntary cooperation of independent actors (including root
      server operators, ISPs, name and address registry operators,
      and registrars) in the Internet community around the world. ICANN
      has no weapons; it has no coercive power. Its ability to carry
      out its mission over the long term requires broad global consensus
      and broad global support. It also depends on the continued acquiescence
      of the world's governments in the notion that an private sector
      entity like ICANN can best manage this critical resource. Continued
      controversy over the proper role and function of the general
      Internet community in ICANN's decision-making processes is not
      helpful to these objectives.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, it seems logically inescapable
      that the general Internet community should have some appropriate
      input into ICANN policy decisions, since those decisions surely
      can affect their ability to use the Internet in many different
      ways. There may be a very legitimate debate on the form that
      community input should take, but there should be no debate that
      some appropriate form of general Internet community input must
      be found.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">ICANN is engaged in an organizational and
      development process that has produced significant progress since
      its creation two years ago. Assuming decisions on TLD issues
      at this meeting, it will have taken some action on each of the
      specific objectives set forth for it in the White Paper. Not
      all of ICANN's structural and organizational issues have been
      completely solved, but on all of them, with the obvious exception
      of the At Large problem, great progress has been or is being
      made.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Unfortunately, it is hard to see that any
      real progress has been made on this problem since ICANN's creation.
      To some extent, this issue seems to provide the ultimate challenge
      in generating consensus from the entire Internet community --
      which includes not only individual users, but governments, technical
      managers, businesses and non-commercial organizations, among
      others. All of these segments of the Internet community have
      a legitimate interest in the solution to this problem, and especially
      in a solution that does not threaten the stability of the various
      aspects of the Internet for which ICANN has some responsibility.
      Thus, it is axiomatic that any effective solution must attract
      the support of the entire Internet community; without that consensus,
      as we have seen over the last several years, the problem will
      remain unresolved.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>III. The Current State of Affairs.</B></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-10mar00.htm">Cairo</A>
      and <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-16jul00.htm">Yokohama</A>,
      after considerable public discussion and faced with an apparent
      lack of consensus support for any particular method of populating
      an At Large component of the ICANN Board, the Board adopted a
      compromise interim solution: the direct selection of five ICANN
      directors by a self-selected At Large constituency, combined
      with the continued service of four of the original ICANN directors
      (for a period not to exceed two years) to ensure that there would
      remain nine At Large &quot;slots&quot; on the ICANN Board until
      (at a minimum) the results of the At Large study were implemented.
      As part of this compromise, it was agreed that, during the next
      two years, there would be a &quot;clean-sheet&quot; study of
      how to appropriately provide for input and influence into ICANN
      policy deliberations and actions by the general Internet community,
      including whether and how At Large directors should be selected
      in the future, and any other issues necessary to solve this problem.
      The five At Large directors have now been chosen, in a process
      that was certainly not free of problems, but which will provide
      very useful factual data for this study. The four continuing
      original directors have also now been identified. The next step
      is to create a structure for a study that has the potential to
      be (1) effective in trying to solve the problem, and (2) credible
      in its conclusions.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">IV. Proposed Conceptual Basis for the
      Study.</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">This problem must be solved in some way
      that actually works mechanically, but it must also be solved
      in a way that generates broad consensus support for the solution
      as a workable and appropriate mechanism for broad Internet community
      input into the ICANN consensus development process. This means
      that the study must be (and be perceived to be) open and inclusive;
      it must be managed in a way that promotes the development of
      consensus, not a battle of competing designs; and the result
      must satisfy the legitimate desire of the broad Internet community
      to have meaningful input into ICANN processes and decisions.
      This is obviously easier said than done, but we believe it can
      be done.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The ICANN staff suggests that the following
      general principles should guide this study:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">1. The study should be undertaken by a
        group separate from the ICANN Board. The Study Committee, as
        we will refer to it in these comments, should be a relatively
        small group (perhaps 5-9 people) that is to the extent possible
        representative of the Internet community as a whole. We suggest
        that one member of the Study Committee should be a sitting ICANN
        Board member, bringing to the Study Committee the history and
        experience of ICANN's efforts to deal with this issue. The remaining
        members of the Study Committee should, to the extent practical,
        reflect the breadth of relevant interests in the Internet community,
        including non-commercial interests, commercial interests, public
        bodies (governments, treaty organizations or other multi-national
        organizations), the technical community, and the general user
        community. We believe it would be desirable to include on the
        Committee one member who is expert in election issues generally.
        Finally, the Study Committee should, again to the extent practical,
        also be geographically representative. We suggest that the Board
        solicit recommendations from the community, as described below,
        for appropriate members of this Study Committee, and in particular
        for a Chair (or co-Chairs) whose reputation(s) will help to generate
        confidence in the objectivity of the effort.<BR>
<BR>
        2. An Executive Director should be selected who would undertake
        the day-to-day staff work, under the direction of the Study Committee,
        of the consensus development effort itself. For purposes of funding
        and administration, the Executive Director should report to the
        ICANN CEO; in all other respects, the Executive Director should
        report to the Study Committee Chair. <BR>
<BR>
        3. The Study Committee should be specifically charged with finding
        a consensus solution to this problem that will provide a mechanism
        for appropriate input by the general Internet community while
        also permitting effective and efficient management of ICANN and
        the achievement of its specific technical and administrative
        mission. The Study Committee in its final report should specifically
        answer the following questions (along with such other specific
        inquiries as it deems appropriate):</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">a. Should the ICANN Board include At Large
          Directors?</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">b. If so, how many such At Large Directors
          should there be?</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">c. How should any such At Large Directors
          be selected?</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">d. If selection by an At Large membership
          is recommended, what processes and procedures should be used
          to create that At Large membership? What minimum criteria, if
          any, should be required for membership? Precisely how should
          an At Large membership select At Large Directors?</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">e. If an At Large membership is to exist,
          what should its structure, role and functions be?</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Any report and recommendations by the Study
        Committee should, at a minimum, provide a report on the consensus
        position in the community, if one has been generated, on each
        of these questions, along with a clear explanation of the rationale
        underlying that consensus.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">4. As implied immediately above, the Study
        Committee should function as a true consensus development body,
        seeking input from all and attempting to facilitate the creation,
        from all of those participating, of a true consensus solution
        to this problem. This probably means that the Study Committee,
        in addition to commissioning or undertaking any studies or analyses
        it thinks appropriate or necessary, should also facilitate and
        encourage broad participation by multiple other groups, either
        by encouraging them to undertake (at their own cost) their own
        analyses or studies and submitting those to the Study Committee
        for its use in the consensus development process, or by encouraging
        their participation in any public forums or other meetings that
        the Study Committee might sponsor. Any independent studies that
        are undertaken should, to be most useful, document the process,
        input and nature and extent of support for any particular proposal.
        The Study Committee should also provide multiple mechanisms for
        input from the community, including bulletin boards, mailing
        lists, and perhaps (in its discretion) one or more public meetings.
        The Study Committee should seek to facilitate the transformation
        of the various inputs that it receives toward a recommendation
        that could receive broad support throughout the community In
        addition, the Study Committee should seek to facilitate consensus
        in any other appropriate way, including the preparation and distribution
        of concept papers and the promulgation of specific questions
        and other inquiries to those participating in this effort.<BR>
<BR>
        5. Assuming it is able to identify a consensus, the Study Committee
        should report and document that consensus, and accept and evaluate
        any public comment on that preliminary report. Following that
        public comment and any further efforts it feels are necessary
        and appropriate in light of those comments, the Study Committee
        should report its findings to the ICANN Board, and simultaneously
        post that final report for public comment. Following receipt
        of the Study Committee's report, the ICANN Board should receive
        and evaluate any public comments on that report, and devote a
        minimum of one full day at one or more quarterly Board meetings
        to public discussion and debate on the report and its suggestions.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">6. Following the conclusion of the process
        outlined above, the ICANN Board should take such actions as it
        deems appropriate to recognize any community consensus that exists
        on this subject, and in particular to amend its bylaws and/or
        take any other steps necessary to provide an appropriate mechanism
        for input and involvement by the general Internet community in
        the ICANN consensus development process.<BR>
<BR>
        V. Funding.<BR>
        In addition to the schedule, another critical issue relating
        to the study is the budget necessary to accomplish its purpose
        - both the amount and the source of the funds. One advantage
        of the Study Committee acting principally as a consensus development
        body, and encouraging multiple independent studies as part of
        that process, is the fact that funding requirements will be dispersed
        to some extent, but the Study Committee itself will still require
        significant resources. There are no funds in the current ICANN
        budget for this purpose. The staff recommends that the community
        be asked to make suggestions for how the Study Committee's work
        be funded in the comment period recommended below. In addition,
        we suggest that the Study Committee be required to include in
        its Melbourne report a recommended budget (and suggestions for
        the source of any funds not at that time already committed) for
        the completion of its work from that point.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">VI. Timing.</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The process adopted by the ICANN Board
      in Yokohama contemplated that the study required by the bylaws
      would be completed by the time of the second ICANN meeting in
      2001, and that the ICANN Board would adopt whatever bylaws or
      other changes were necessary to implement the recommendations
      it chose to adopt by its annual meeting in 2001. The notion was
      that this would leave sufficient time to take whatever actions
      were required so that the selection of any new At Large directors,
      assuming that was the result of the Board's action, could be
      done so that they could take their seats on the Board no later
      than at the conclusion of the Annual Meeting in 2002. On reflection,
      it may be that this is too aggressive a schedule at the beginning
      and too generous at the end, but the staff is reluctant to suggest
      specific changes. Therefore, we suggest that the Study Committee
      itself be required to report at the first ICANN meeting in 2001,
      to be held in Melbourne, Australia on March 10-13, 2001, on the
      schedule and process it thinks is necessary to accomplish its
      mission, with the caveat that any such schedule must conclude
      with an ICANN Board decision that can be fully implemented, as
      required by the current bylaws, no later than the ICANN Annual
      Meeting in 2002.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">VII. Recommendation.</FONT></B><FONT
       FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
      The staff recommends that the Board publish these staff recommendations
      during the Annual Meeting in 2000, and solicit comments on them
      over the 30 days following the conclusion of that meeting. During
      that time, the Board should also solicit recommendations from
      the community for membership on the Study Committee, and for
      potential sources of funding for the study. As soon as possible
      following the public comment period, but no later than January
      15, 2001, the Board should either establish the Study Committee
      or, if persuaded by the public comments to adopt some different
      approach, take such other action as is appropriate to initiate
      the At Large study process required by Article II, Section 5
      of the Bylaws.</FONT></P>
