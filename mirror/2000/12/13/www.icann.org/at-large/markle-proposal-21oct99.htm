<P><b><font face="Arial">I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</font></b></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3>
<P><font face="Arial">The <a href="../index.html">Internet Corporation 
  for Assigned Names and Numbers</a> seeks grant support from the <a href="http://www.markle.org/index.html">Markle 
  Foundation</a> in the amount of $200,000 for the initiation of its At Large 
  Membership program. These funds will be used to (a) complete plans for the creation 
  of the At Large membership component of ICANN, (b) engage staff to manage and 
  implement the program for the next six months, (c) obtain necessary computer 
  and network resources to support the membership database and applications, (d) 
  provide administrative and logistic support for the At Large Membership Task 
  Force, which will advise and assist ICANN with outreach, public awareness, and 
  the creation of a broadly representative and diverse At Large membership, (e) 
  prepare and distribute accessible informational materials to explain ICANN and 
  educate potential members in several major languages, and (e) support the first 
  phase of At Large membership elections.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">A grant of $100,000 will afford ICANN the minimum financial 
  support necessary to launch the At Large Membership and elections; a larger 
  grant of $200,000 would allow ICANN to dedicate significantly greater resources 
  toward outreach, member recruitment, and public awareness initiatives, such 
  as well-designed and accessible educational materials in major non-English languages.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Although the Board of Directors places a high priority on 
  the earliest possible creation of its At Large membership, ICANN does not at 
  this time have the financial resources to begin the At Large membership program 
  without external support. The corporation is currently in a transition period: 
  up to the present, its initial operations have been funded by private contributions; 
  in the future, its permanent funding base will come primarily from Internet 
  registries and registrars. ICANN has incurred substantial debt during the 1998-99 
  startup period, and will not likely have any discretionary funds with which 
  to support At Large membership for at least a year without the one-time support 
  sought in this proposal. The requested grant funds will be used solely for incremental, 
  direct expenses of the At Large membership program as described in Section VI 
  below, which will not include any overhead or indirect costs of the corporation. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">ICANN is organized as a California non-profit corporation 
  and has applied to the Internal Revenue Service for recognition of its tax exemption 
  under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.</font></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B>
<P><font face="Arial">II. INTRODUCTION</font></P>
</B> 
<P><font face="Arial">The significance of ICANN's At Large membership election 
  process is enormous; accordingly, so are the risks of failure and the opportunities 
  of success. The ICANN At Large elections will represent the first time in which 
  every interested member of the global Internet community will have the opportunity 
  to participate in the online election of Internet policymakers. A successful 
  round of elections (i.e., elections that are free, fair, efficient, and globally 
  representative) will help to establish the viability of effective self-regulation 
  by the global Internet community. Failure in this process (i.e., elections marked 
  by fraud, capture, or low participation) will likewise damage the future prospects 
  for meaningful self-regulation. Providing crucial one-time support for the successful 
  launch of the ICANN At Large membership and election process is thus consistent 
  with the Markle Foundation's mission to promote democracy online.</font></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><font face="Arial">III. BACKGROUND</font></P>
</B> 
<P><font face="Arial">In July, 1997, the Clinton Administration published an executive 
  order calling for privatization of the Internet Domain Name System (DNS) and 
  began an open and consultative policy development process which lead to the 
  publication of a document entitled "Management of Internet Names and Addresses," 
  commonly known as the White Paper, in June, 1998 [<U>see</U> &lt;<a href="../general/white-paper-05jun98.htm">http://www.icann.org/general/white-paper-05jun98.htm</a>&gt;]. 
  The White Paper stated the desire of the U.S. Government that a private, nonprofit 
  corporation be formed to assume responsibility for the Domain Name and IP addressing 
  systems and certain related functions, and called for proposals to be submitted 
  to accomplish this goal. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">A. <U>White Paper Position on Representation in new DNS 
  Corporation</u></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">With respect to representation, the White Paper stated, 
  </font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Arial">"The new corporation should operate as a private entity 
      for the benefit of the Internet community as a whole. The development of 
      sound, fair, and widely accepted policies for the management of DNS will 
      depend on input from the broad and growing community of Internet users. 
      Management structures should reflect the functional and geographic diversity 
      of the Internet and its users. Mechanisms should be established to ensure 
      international participation in decision making."</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Arial">Speaking further to actions to be taken by the Board of 
  Directors of the new corporation, the White Paper proposed that the entity's 
  organizational documents:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Arial">"2) direct the Interim Board to establish a system for 
      electing a Board of Directors for the new corporation that insures that 
      the new corporation's Board of Directors reflects the geographical and functional 
      diversity of the Internet, and is sufficiently flexible to permit evolution 
      to reflect changes in the constituency of Internet stakeholders. Nominations 
      to the Board of Directors should preserve, as much as possible, the tradition 
      of bottom-up governance of the Internet, and Board Members should be elected 
      from membership or other associations open to all or through other mechanisms 
      that ensure broad representation and participation in the election process."</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Arial">B. <U>Department of Commerce Requirement concerning ICANN 
  Membership</u></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Subsequently, the US Department of Commerce (DOC) recognized 
  ICANN -- the corporation proposed by Dr. Jon Postel in September, 1998 -- in 
  a <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/icann-memorandum.htm">Memorandum 
  of Understanding/Joint Project Agreement</a> dated November 25, 1998. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">With regard to membership, the MOU specified that ICANN 
  and DOC would,</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Arial">"8. Collaborate on the design, development, and testing 
      of appropriate membership mechanisms that foster accountability to and representation 
      of the global and functional diversity of the Internet and its users, within 
      the structure of the private-sector DNS management organization."</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Arial">C. <U>ICANN Membership Advisory Committee</u></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The ICANN Bylaws provide for four organizational units having 
  membership attributes. Three of the units are named "Supporting Organizations" 
  (SO) and are designed to provide specific mechanisms for the participation of 
  business and technical interests in the policy development and consensus mechanisms 
  of ICANN. The fourth is an At Large membership designed to ensure adequate representation, 
  on a worldwide basis, of the interests of all Internet users. Each SO names 
  three ICANN Directors, while the At Large membership names nine, for a total 
  of eighteen elected Directors and an <I>ex officio</I> voting Chief Executive 
  Officer.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Consistent with both Internet tradition and the guidance 
  of the White Paper, the ICANN Board has worked closely with the Internet community 
  to support bottom-up and self-organizing efforts for all four of its membership 
  entities. As of August, 1999, constituents of each of the Supporting Organizations 
  had submitted and received approval of proposals for their creation and self-administration. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Seeking advice from the community on the complex issues 
  associated with creation of an At Large membership, ICANN created a <a href="../membership-com.html">Membership 
  Advisory Committee (MAC)</a> in January, 1999, and asked for its recommendations 
  on a range of membership policy and procedural issues. An interim report was 
  given to the Board at its meeting in Singapore in March, 1999 and a final report 
  was delivered at its meeting in Berlin, in May, 1999 (<U>see</U> &lt;<a href="../macberlin.htm">http://www.icann.org/macberlin.htm</a>&gt;).</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">D. <U>ICANN Board Actions to Create At Large Membership</u></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">By resolution at its Berlin meeting, the ICANN Board asked 
  staff to review the Membership Advisory Committee (MAC) report and commentary 
  and make recommendations to the Board, for consideration at its Santiago, Chile, 
  meeting in August, 1999, on an implementation plan that was responsive to the 
  MAC's suggestions.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Also in Berlin, the Board adopted four general principles 
  to guide the creation of an At Large membership for ICANN:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Arial">1. "Members" should be individuals, and only "members" 
      should vote for At Large Directors.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial">2. The election process for At Large Directors should 
      take place in stages, to allow for adjustments in the process based on experience.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial">3. At Large Directors should be geographically diverse 
      and broadly representative of the Internet user community.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial">4. The costs of At Large membership should be borne 
      by the At Large members.</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Arial">Two staff reports on At Large membership were prepared for 
  the Santiago meeting, one dealing with analysis and recommendations on an implementation 
  plan, and the other dealing with legal questions concerning membership provisions 
  in California nonprofit corporation statutes (<U>see</U> &lt;<a href="../santiago/membership.htm">http://www.icann.org/santiago/membership.htm</a>&gt;).</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">After considering the staff reports and hearing public comment, 
  the Board took a series of actions on At Large membership at the recent Santiago 
  meeting. Together with its Berlin resolutions and the recommendations of the 
  MAC, these decisions establish the basic structure for an ICANN At Large Membership. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">In addition, to give some sustainable momentum to the planning 
  and implementation of a large and globally diverse membership, the ICANN Board 
  authorized the creation of a Membership Implementation Task Force, whose members 
  will initially focus on membership outreach.</font></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B>
<P><font face="Arial">IV. ICANN At Large Membership Structure</font></P>
</B> 
<P><font face="Arial">After considering a range of issues affecting structure, 
  the ICANN Directors have adopted an indirect representation mechanism in which 
  an At Large membership of a minimum size of 5,000 individuals will elect an 
  At Large Council composed of up to eighteen members. While ICANN will endeavor 
  to attract a significantly larger membership, the 5,000-member minimum threshold 
  constitutes a safeguard against the potential effects of a small and unrepresentative 
  electorate.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">As currently conceived, the At Large Council will in turn 
  select nine individuals to become the At Large Directors of ICANN. (As with 
  the other elements of the At Large membership and election process, the Board's 
  decision on this point is subject to further input from the Internet community 
  and the nine newly elected Directors from ICANN's supporting organizations). 
  Up to ten members of the At Large Council will be elected from each of the five 
  geographic regions into which ICANN is currently divided, with no two regional 
  members coming from the same country. The remaining up to eight members will 
  be elected from a single global pool of candidates, with no restrictions on 
  geographic origin.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Balancing a desire to encourage wide participation in ICANN 
  membership on a worldwide basis with the need to protect against election fraud, 
  the minimum requirements for an individual to become an At Large member will 
  be (a) completion of an online membership application, including a statement 
  of a commitment to participate in ICANN's activities and to abide by ICANN's 
  bylaws; (b) a working Internet email address; and (c) a single physical residence 
  verified by a postal mail address.</font></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B>
<P><font face="Arial">V. At Large Membership Implementation</font></P>
</B> 
<P><font face="Arial">The initial appointed At Large Directors of ICANN wish to 
  proceed expeditiously with implementation of the At Large membership so that 
  their elected successors may take office as soon as possible. However, translation 
  of the membership structure that has been adopted by the Board into detailed 
  plans and procedures that can operate faultlessly in a worldwide, interactive 
  Internet environment requires significant staff and technical resources.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The membership implementation plan, which is being developed 
  under the direction of interim President/CEO Mike Roberts, has six program elements, 
  which will proceed in a parallel and coordinated manner. </font></P>
</FONT>
<DIR>
  <DIR> <FONT SIZE=3>
    <P><font face="Arial">(1) Identify a funding source sufficient to meet the 
      minimum expenditure requirements of the initial phase of the At Large membership 
      program. A minimum estimated budget of $100,000 has been adopted, which 
      is described in the following section of this proposal.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial">(2) Engage staff to manage and implement the program 
      for at least the next six months. A membership program manager position 
      has been defined and created. A search for qualified applicants will begin 
      as soon as funding is assured.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial">(3) Complete plans for the creation of an At Large membership 
      component of ICANN. The membership program manager will be responsible for 
      development of detailed plans, resource requirements and timing. The plan 
      will be based on previous work by the MAC and ICANN staff, Board membership 
      resolutions, and assistance from the new Membership Implementation Task 
      Force. </font></P>
    </font>
    <P><font face="Arial">(<FONT SIZE=3>4) Obtain necessary computer and network 
      resources to support the membership database and applications. The membership 
      database and online server will be located at the ICANN administrative headquarters 
      in Marina del Rey, California, using ICANN computer facilities and under 
      the supervision of ICANN technical staff. Design, development, installation 
      and testing of membership software and hardware will be contracted to a 
      qualified technical services firm.</font></font></P>
    <FONT SIZE=3>
    <P><font face="Arial">(5) Provide administrative and logistic support for 
      the new Membership Implementation Task Force. The membership program manager 
      will be primary liaison to the task force, whose intended functions include 
      carrying out a worldwide outreach program to recruit At Large members, reviewing 
      specifications for membership computer programs, assisting with organization 
      of the At Large Council, providing independent oversight of the initial 
      At Large Council election, and proposing a permanent funding mechanism for 
      the At Large Membership.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial">Likewise, ICANN would welcome the assistance of the 
      Markle Foundation in identifying one or more appropriate and interested 
      third party organizations with experience and credibility in the area of 
      election process design and oversight. Such an organization would provide 
      (i) practical advice on, for example, rules for fair campaigning, minimizing 
      fraud in online voter registration and balloting mechanisms, and increasing 
      Internet community participation, and (ii) independent third party oversight, 
      monitoring and verification of the election results.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial">(6) Specify, develop and test necessary interfaces, 
      processes, and procedures and conduct the first At Large Council election. 
      Depending on progress toward meeting the minimum At Large membership threshold 
      requirement of 5000 individual members, the ICANN Board is expected to approve 
      election procedures and set a date for the first election of members of 
      the At Large Council at its first meeting in the year 2000, currently expected 
      to be the first week in March. Prior to approving the election date, the 
      membership staff, working with the task force, will have completed and tested 
      the required computer programs and related fraud protection provisions of 
      the election procedures.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial">In addition, the membership staff and Membership Implementation 
      Task Force will be develop a fair and transparent process for online campaigning, 
      including an election website with online forums and venues through which 
      the candidates can communicate with the At Large Membership, and vice versa.</font></P>
    </font></DIR>
</DIR>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>
<P><font face="Arial">VI. At Large Membership Program - Initial Budget</font></P>
</B> 
<P><font face="Arial">On a long term basis, the ICANN Board has determined that 
  the At Large membership should fund its own costs of administration, as is the 
  case with the three Supporting Organizations. However, initial funding is needed 
  to create the membership and to support its first election of At Large Council 
  members. Additionally, the Board has agreed with the MAC recommendation that 
  membership fees be waived at least until such time as an elected At Large Council 
  has had an opportunity to review and reach a conclusion on future funding.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The total estimated budget sets a minimum figure of $100,000, 
  which will afford ICANN a single employee, together with the minimum necessary 
  hardware, software, technical services, and expenses. A larger grant of $200,000 
  would permit ICANN to add additional staff and/or professional support for global 
  outreach and public awareness efforts, which will otherwise depend primarily 
  upon the efforts of ICANN's hardworking volunteers and supporters. For example, 
  the commitment of additional Markle funds would enable ICANN to (i) expand and 
  accelerate its efforts to establish reciprocal membership relationships with 
  relevant associations, non-profits, and Internet-oriented membership organizations, 
  and (ii) attract matching in-kind donations of advertising space from leading 
  web portals and content providers</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The following budget estimate has been developed to support 
  the first six months of the At Large membership program:</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial"><b>Budget notes:</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">(a) In addition to funding of the initial budget sought 
  from the Markle Foundation, it is possible that some of the budget line items 
  may be made available to ICANN as donations or in kind services. As a part of 
  the At Large membership formation process, ICANN will undertake the important 
  task of explaining what ICANN is, what ICANN does, and why the members of the 
  global Internet community should be involved in its At Large Membership and 
  At Large Elections. The funds for professional services requested in item (6) 
  above would be dedicated to an aggressive global, multi-language outreach and 
  public awareness campaign for ICANN's At Large Membership.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">(b) The Membership program manager position is a permanent 
  staff requirement but the funding requested from Markle is for only the first 
  six months. This position may be filled on a consultant or other temporary basis, 
  which would defer a permanent staff hiring decision to a future date.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">(c) Computer hardware and software costs are only for incremental 
  expenses necessary for the membership program. Router, firewall, etc., expenses 
  are already covered in ICANN's regular budget. It is not intended that membership 
  applications software will be developed uniquely for ICANN. The technical services 
  contract assumes use of available software to meet ICANN requirements with a 
  minimum amount of customization.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">(d) The professional services for outreach identified in 
  item (4) include assistance with design of both online and hardcopy information 
  resources, contacts with Internet portal and ISP organizations for appropriate 
  publicity, in-kind donations of advertising space, etc. The funds requested 
  in item (7) would be dedicated to expand and accelerate efforts to leverage 
  these outreach efforts by attracting matching in-kind donations of advertising 
  space and public service announcements from existing web portals, membership 
  associations, and other interested groups.</font></P>
