  <p><font face="Arial">This page sets forth a proposal developed by the ICANN

    We encourage you to review the proposal and provide your comments and suggestions 
    for improvement. Click <a href="http://www.icann.org/mbx/selfnomination/">here</a> 
    to go to the <a href="http://www.icann.org/mbx/selfnomination/">Public Comment 
    Forum for these proposed rules</a>. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">After public comment, the Board plans to adopt and implement 
    a set of rules for member-nomination. <a href="http://www.icann.org/mbx/selfnomination/">Comments</a> 
    should be submitted by July 6, 2000, so that they reach the Board in time 
    for consideration at its July 16 meeting in Yokohama. Also in July , the Board 
    expects the <a href="../elcom/index.html">Election Committee</a> to 
    post for public review and comment its proposals for the campaign and voting 
    segments, along with its recommendations for the online voting system, so 
    that the Board can finalize those components at its Yokohama meetings.

  <p><font face="Arial">As noted, the first phase of the election process is the 
    determination of which names will appear on the final ballot to be presented 
    to the At Large Members. There will be two avenues for a name to appear on 
    that ballot: (a) by nomination of the <a href="../nomcom/index.html">Nominating 
    Committee</a>; (b) by member-nomination.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The following proposed rules are intended to create a 
    structure for the member-nominations process that meets the following basic 
    criteria:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">Candidates who demonstrate a certain minimum threshold 
      of support among the At Large Members in their geographic region* should 
      appear on the ballot, together with the set of candidates nominated by the 
      Nominating Committee.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Candidates seeking to member-nominate should be supported 
      by At Large Members from more than one country.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">At Large Members should be informed of the individuals 
      seeking to member-nominate, and </font><font face="Arial">should have access 
      to background information about them.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Individuals seeking to member-nominate should not be 
      given access to the email addresses or other personal information of the 
      At Large Members.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Candidates seeking to member-nominate should not be able 
      to flood the At Large Members with unsolicited email appeals for their support. 
      </font> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial"><i>* Background Note: Under the current election 
          plan, the At Large Members will elect five (5) Directors to the ICANN 
          Board. Each of those five must be the citizen of a different geographic 
          region, as defined by the ICANN Bylaws: Africa, Asia/Pacific, Europe, 
          Latin America/Caribbean, and North America). Voters in each geographic 
          region will cast votes only for the candidates in that region, meaning
