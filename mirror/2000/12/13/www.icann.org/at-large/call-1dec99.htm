<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">ICANN is actively seeking expressions of interest from 
    individuals who would like to volunteer to serve as members of ICANN's Membership 
    Implementation Task Force. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="+1">What is the Membership Implementation 
  Task Force? What will it do?</font></b> </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial">The Membership Implementation Task Force will play a key 
    role in ICANN's effort to create a broad, diverse, and globally representative 
    At Large Membership, through which 9 of ICANN's 19 Directors will be elected.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The Membership Implementation Task Force was chartered 
    by the ICANN Board at its August and November meetings. The Board charged 
    the Membership Implementation Task Force with the following responsibilities:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial">&quot;RESOLVED [99.144], that the President and CEO 
      is directed to convene a Membership Implementation Task Force, which shall 
      generate and implement strategies for outreach and recruitment of a broad 
      and numerous membership that is globally representative of the Internet 
      user community; design effective membership authentication and online election 
      procedures; and undertake such other membership implementation responsibilities 
      as may be assigned to it by the Board or the President.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">The Membership Implementation Task Force is thus intended 
    to be a body of active and committed &quot;do-ers&quot; who will work to make 
    the goal of a broad, diverse, and globally representative At Large Membership 
    a reality. More specifically, its responsibilities will include the following:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">developing and implementing outreach and recruitment 
      strategies;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">investigating, designing, testing, and implementing 
      effective registration and election mechanisms, including membership authentication 
      and online voting procedures;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial"> assisting with the organization of the At Large Council;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">planning for independent oversight of the initial At 
      Large Council election; and</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial"> proposing a permanent funding mechanism for the At 
      Large Membership.</font></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="+1">How will the Membership Implementation 
  Task Force do its work?</font></b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial">As with most ICANN bodies, the bulk of the Membership 
    Implementation Task Force's work will be done through the Internet, via email 
    and the web. Periodic teleconferences may be necessary as well.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The Membership Implementation Task Force will have a chair, 
    and will also include a number of small, narrowly-focused task groups, such 
    as task groups on voting systems, election oversight, and outreach to specific 
    regions. The Membership Implementation Task Force will have staff support 
    from ICANN's Membership Project Manager.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="+1">I'm interested! How do I submit my statement 
  of interest?</font></b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial">Expressions of interest (and any questions) should be 
    sent to <a href="mailto:mclaughlin@icann.org">Andrew McLaughlin</a> &lt;mclaughlin@icann.org&gt;. 
    Statements need not be longer than 100 words, and should include information 
    about your professional background and the contribution you will make toward 
    the work of the Membership Implementation Task Force.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The deadline for expressions of interest is December 21, 
    1999. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="+1">Background on ICANN At Large Membership</font></b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial">For nearly a year, ICANN has been working hard to design 
    and implement an At Large Membership structure through which the 9 At Large 
    Directors on the ICANN Board will be elected by the diverse members of the 
    global Internet community. The following paragraphs outline the history of 
    the effort, and sketch the current implementation plan.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><u><i>Background</i></u>. In July, 1997, the Clinton Administration 
    published an executive order calling for privatization of the Internet Domain 
    Name System (DNS) and began an open and consultative policy development process 
    which lead to the publication of a document entitled "Management of Internet 
    Names and Addresses," commonly known as the <a href="../general/white-paper/05jun98.htm">White 
    Paper</a>, in June, 1998. The White Paper stated the desire of the U.S. Government 
    that a private, non-profit corporation be formed to assume responsibility 
    for the Domain Name and IP addressing systems and certain related functions, 
    and called for proposals to be submitted to accomplish this goal.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><u> <i>White Paper Position on Representation in new DNS 
    Corporation</i></u>. With respect to representation, the White Paper stated, 
    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial">"The new corporation should operate as a private entity 
      for the benefit of the Internet community as a whole. The development of 
      sound, fair, and widely accepted policies for the management of DNS will 
      depend on input from the broad and growing community of Internet users. 
      Management structures should reflect the functional and geographic diversity 
      of the Internet and its users. Mechanisms should be established to ensure 
      international participation in decision making." </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">Speaking further to actions to be taken by the Board of 
    Directors of the new corporation, the White Paper proposed that the entity's 
    organizational documents: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial">"2) direct the Interim Board to establish a system for 
      electing a Board of Directors for the new corporation that insures that 
      the new corporation's Board of Directors reflects the geographical and functional 
      diversity of the Internet, and is sufficiently flexible to permit evolution 
      to reflect changes in the constituency of Internet stakeholders. Nominations 
      to the Board of Directors should preserve, as much as possible, the tradition 
      of bottom-up governance of the Internet, and Board Members should be elected 
      from membership or other associations open to all or through other mechanisms 
      that ensure broad representation and participation in the election process." 
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial"><u> <i>Department of Commerce Requirement concerning ICANN 
    Membership</i></u>. Subsequently, the US Department of Commerce (DOC) recognized 
    ICANN -- the corporation proposed by Dr. Jon Postel in September, 1998 -- 
    in a <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/icann-memorandum.htm">Memorandum 
    of Understanding/Joint Project Agreement</a> dated November 25, 1998. With 
    regard to membership, the MOU specified that ICANN and DOC would, "8. Collaborate 
    on the design, development, and testing of appropriate membership mechanisms 
    that foster accountability to and representation of the global and functional 
    diversity of the Internet and its users, within the structure of the private-sector 
    DNS management organization." </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><u> <i>ICANN Membership Advisory Committee</i></u>. The 
    ICANN Bylaws provide for four organizational units having membership attributes. 
    Three of the units are named "Supporting Organizations" (SO) and are designed 
    to provide specific mechanisms for the participation of business and technical 
    interests in the policy development and consensus mechanisms of ICANN. The 
    fourth is an At Large Membership designed to ensure accountability and adequate 
    representation, on a worldwide basis, of the interests of all Internet users. 
    Each SO names three ICANN Directors, while the At Large membership names nine, 
    for a total of eighteen elected Directors and an ex officio voting Chief Executive 
    Officer. Consistent with both Internet tradition and the guidance of the White 
    Paper, the ICANN Board has worked closely with the Internet community to support 
    bottom-up and self-organizing efforts for all four of its membership entities. 
    All three SOs are now operational, and all three have named their Directors 
    to the ICANN Board. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Seeking advice from the community on the complex issues 
    associated with creation of an At Large membership, ICANN created a <a href="../membership-com.html">Membership 
    Advisory Committee (MAC)</a> in January, 1999, and asked for its recommendations 
    on a range of membership policy and procedural issues. To assist the MAC with 
    its work, ICANN commissioned a <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rcs/">study</a> 
    by Harvard Law School's <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu">Berkman Center 
    for Internet &amp; Society</a>. The MAC's interim report was given to the 
    Board at its meeting in Singapore in March, 1999 and a <a href="../macberlin.htm">final 
    report and commentary</a> was delivered at its meeting in Berlin, in May, 
    1999. </font></p>
  <p> <font face="Arial"><u><i>ICANN Board Actions to Create At Large Membership</i></u>. 
    By resolution at its Berlin meeting, the ICANN Board <a href="../minutes/berlinminutes.html">asked</a> 
    staff to review the Membership Advisory Committee (MAC) <a href="../macberlin.htm">report 
    and commentary</a> and make recommendations to the Board, for consideration 
    at its Santiago, Chile, meeting in August, 1999, on an implementation plan 
    that was responsive to the Mac's suggestions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Also in Berlin, the Board <a href="../minutes/berlinminutes.html">adopted</a> 
    four general principles to guide the creation of an At Large membership for 
    ICANN: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial">1. "Members" should be individuals, and only "members" 
      should vote for At Large Directors.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">2. The election process for At Large Directors should 
      take place in stages, to allow for adjustments in the process based on experience. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">3. At Large Directors should be geographically diverse 
      and broadly representative of the Internet user community. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">4. The costs of At Large membership should be borne 
      by the At Large members. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial"><a href="../santiago/membership.htm">Two 
    staff reports on At Large membership</a> were prepared for the Santiago meeting, 
    one dealing with analysis and recommendations on an implementation plan, and 
    the other dealing with legal questions concerning membership provisions in 
    California nonprofit corporation statutes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">After considering the staff reports and hearing public 
    comment, the Board took a series of <a href="../santiago/santiago-resolutions.htm">actions</a> 
    on At Large membership at the recent <a href="../santiago/santiago-resolutions.htm">Santiago 
    meeting</a>. Together with its <a href="../minutes/berlinminutes.html">Berlin 
    resolutions</a> and the <a href="../macberlin.htm">recommendations 
    of the MAC</a>, these decisions establish the basic structure for an ICANN 
    At Large Membership. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">In addition, to give some sustainable momentum to the 
    planning and implementation of a large and globally diverse membership, the 
    ICANN Board authorized the creation of a Membership Implementation Task Force, 
    whose members will initially focus on membership outreach and recruitment. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><i><u> ICANN At Large Membership Structure</u></i>. After 
    considering a range of issues affecting structure, the ICANN Directors have 
    adopted an indirect representation mechanism in which an At Large Membership 
    of a minimum size of 5000 individuals will elect an At Large Council composed 
    of up to eighteen members. The At Large Council will in turn select nine individuals 
    to become the At Large Directors of ICANN. Up to ten members of the At Large 
    Council will be elected from each of the five geographic regions into which 
    ICANN is currently divided, with no two regional members coming from the same 
    country. The remaining (up to) eight members will be elected from a single 
    global pool of candidates, with no restrictions on geographic origin. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Balancing a desire to encourage wide participation in 
    ICANN membership on a worldwide basis with the need to protect against election 
    fraud, the minimum requirements for an individual to become an At Large member 
    will be (a) completion of an online membership application, including a statement 
    of a commitment to participate in ICANN's activities; (b) a working Internet 
    email address; and (c) a single physical residence verified by a postal mail 
    address.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><i><u> At Large Membership Implementation</u></i>. The 
    initial appointed At Large Directors of ICANN wish to proceed expeditiously 
    with implementation of the At Large membership so that their elected successors 
    may take office as soon as possible. However, translation of the membership 
    structure that has been adopted by the Board into detailed plans and procedures 
    that can operate faultlessly in a worldwide, interactive Internet environment 
    requires significant staff and technical resources. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The membership implementation plan, which is being developed 
    under the direction of interim President/CEO Mike Roberts, has six program 
    elements, which will proceed in a parallel but coordinated manner. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial">(1) Identify a funding source sufficient to meet the 
      minimum expenditure requirements of the initial phase of the At Large membership 
      program. In early November, the Markle Foundation announced a commitment 
      of $200,000 to fund the initial launch of ICANN's At Large Membership program. 
      A copy of ICANN's application to the Markle Foundation, which outlines the 
      specific implementation and outreach purposes to which the funds will be 
      devoted, can be found <a href="markle-proposal-21oct99.htm">here</a>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">(2) Engage staff to manage and implement the program 
      for at least the next six months. A membership program manager position 
      has been defined and created. A search for qualified applicants is currently 
      underway. The job posting can be found <a href="http://www.icann.org/jobs.htm#membership">here</a>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">(3) Complete plans for the creation of an At Large membership 
      component of ICANN. The membership program manager will be responsible for 
      development of detailed plans, resource requirements and timing. The plan 
      will be based on previous work by the MAC and ICANN staff, Board membership 
      resolutions, and assistance from the new Membership Implementation Task 
      Force. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">(4) Obtain necessary computer and network resources 
      to support the membership database and applications. The membership database 
      and online server will be located at the ICANN administrative headquarters 
      in Marina del Rey, California, using ICANN computer facilities and under 
      the supervision of ICANN technical staff. Design, development, installation 
      and testing of membership software and hardware will be contracted to a 
      qualified technical services firm. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">(5) Provide administrative and logistic support for 
      the new Membership Implementation Task Force. The membership program manager 
      will be primary liaison to the task force, whose intended functions include 
      carrying out a worldwide outreach program to recruit At Large members, reviewing 
      specifications for membership computer programs, assisting with organization 
      of the At Large Council, planning for independent oversight of the initial 
      At Large Council election, and proposing a permanent funding mechanism for 
      the At Large Membership. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">(6) Specify, develop and test necessary processes and 
      procedures and hold the first At Large Council election. Depending on progress 
      toward meeting the minimum At Large membership threshold requirement of 
      5000 individual members, the ICANN Board is expected to approve election 
      procedures and set a date for the first election of members of the At Large 
      Council at its first meeting in the year 2000, currently expected to be 
      the first week in March. Prior to approving the election date, the membership 
      staff, working with the task force, will have completed and tested the required 
      computer programs and related fraud protection provisions of the election 
      procedures. </font></p>
