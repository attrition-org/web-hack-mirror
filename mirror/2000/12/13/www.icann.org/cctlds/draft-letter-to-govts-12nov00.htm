      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">One of the steps in the process of privatizing
      technical management of Internet functions is the achievement
      of stable and appropriate contracts between ICANN and the organizations
      operating country-code top level domains (ccTLDs). In its <A
      HREF="../gac/communique-14jul00.htm">communiqu&eacute; presented
      in Yokohama,</A> the Governmental Advisory Committee  &quot;invite[d]
      ICANN, as a first step, to write to the relevant governments
      and public authorities to ascertain their views concerning the
      current delegation for the ccTLDs that correspond to their jurisdictions.&quot;</FONT></B></P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Since then, ICANN staff has been discussing
      such a letter with various governmental officials and ccTLD managers.
      Differing views as to the letter's appropriate language have
      been expressed. As a means of coming to closure on the form of
      the letter, ICANN staff has prepared the following discussion
      draft for final comment during the annual meeting this coming
      week in Marina del Rey.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial"><HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Dear ____________:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
      and Numbers (ICANN) is an international, not-for-profit, private
      organization to which the United States Government is transferring
      responsibility for various functions associated with the technical
      management of the Internet. One aspect of these functions is
      the coordination of the domain-name-system root zone, including
      the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority's traditional responsibilities
      for coordination of delegations of country-code top-level domain
      registries (ccTLDs).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">One step that must be accomplished before
      ICANN can complete its assumption of these responsibilities is
      the entry of stable and appropriate contracts between ICANN and
      ccTLD managers. ICANN wishes to complete these contracts as soon
      as possible. These contracts will facilitate implementing the
      ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee's &quot;Principles for
      Delegation and Administration of ccTLDs&quot;, 23 February 2000,
      which is posted at: &lt;http://www.icann.org/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm&gt;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">These contracts will likely follow one
      of two forms. One form we anticipate will apply to ccTLD managers
      in jurisdictions where the relevant government or public authority
      has already implemented the GAC Principles. We anticipate a second
      form will apply to ccTLD managers in countries where these Principles
      have not yet been implemented.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">To assist us in determining whether to
      enter a contract with the ccTLD manager for your country and
      in formulating appropriate contract terms, we would appreciate
      to learn from you whether your government or public authority
      is satisfied with the current ccTLD manager. Also, please let
      us know your intentions concerning the implementation of the
      ICANN-GAC principles. In the event that your delegation is the
      subject of a dispute, ICANN does not intend to enter into a contract
      with a ccTLD manager until an agreeable resolution has been achieved.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">To avoid undue delays in this process,
      we ask that you provide any comments you have within sixty days
      of the date of this letter. In the absence of a response on your
      part we will assume your agreement with the current delegation
      for the time being. In this case, please let us know if there
      is any change in this situation in the future.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thank you in advance for your assistance.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Very truly yours,</FONT></P>
