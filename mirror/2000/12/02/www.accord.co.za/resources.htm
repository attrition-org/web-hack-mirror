      hierarchical business structures have given way to flatter, information-driven 
      networks of specialists, partners and cross-functional teams. Work itself 
      has been redefined, with more emphasis on continuous learning, higher order 
      thinking, flexible work schedules and an ever-increasing emphasis on <b>innovation</b>.
