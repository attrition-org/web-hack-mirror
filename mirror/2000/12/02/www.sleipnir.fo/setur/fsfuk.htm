The costs of theUniversity are paid out of public funds, after their approval in the Faroese Governmentbudget. </p><p>The University is governed by the Rector together with the University Council   and the main departmental councils. A liaison committee maintains contact with   the Faroese Government. The University Office is responsible for the day to   day management. There are three departments: the Department of Faroese, the   Department of History and Social Sciences, and the Department of Natural Sciences,   all of which carry out research and give advanced instruction. The University   also arranges courses, lectures etc. for the general public. The Faroese Language   Advisory Office (M&aacute;lstovan) is housed at the University. This office   gives institutions and the general public advice and information concerning   the Faroese language. </p><p>The University has cooperation agreements with other universities, which also cover thecontinuation of studies, and &quot;Nordplus&quot; makes it possible for the universitiesto exchange teachers and students. </p><p>The University also arranges research projects financed by outside sources and itadministers the annual budget grants for study tours to the Faroe Islands for 5-7 foreignstudents, or young researchers, whose studies are connected with the Faroe Islands. </p><p>The three departments employ 19 academic staff and 15 technical/administrative staff.In addition to these there are visiting lecturers and external examiners. </p><p>There are 90 students and four ph.d. students enrolled at the University (January1999).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Department of Faroese</h2><p>The Department carries out research and conducts degree courses in Nordic Studies,particularly Faroese language and literature, and poetry in the oral tradition. </p><p>The Department houses the collection of words for the Faroese dictionary, thecollection of place names, lists, maps, pictures, a collection of examples of Faroeseusage, and a collection of folklore. There is a large collection of tape recordings ofpoetry in the oral tradition, Faroese dialects, place names, and of people's recollectionsin general. The Department has a collection of manuscripts and a library with a readingroom and a small reference library. Much of the work of the Department the past 5 yearshas been devoted to the production of a dictionary of the Faroese language. It waspublished on July 24 1998.</p><p>The Department of Faroese conducts a 2-year degree course (exam. art.) and a 4-yeardegree course (cand. phil.) in Nordic Studies, particularly Faroese language andliterature. There is not enrolment for these courses every year. </p><p>The Department employs 6 academic staff and 4 (full- and part-time) administrativestaff. </p><p>Both in matters of research and teaching the Department cooperates closely withresearch institutions and scholars in other countries, particularly in the Nordiccountries. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Department of History and Social Science</h2><p>The Department carries out research and conducts degree courses in History, CulturalHistory and Social Sciences. Particular emphasis is placed on research into Faroesehistory, cultural history and Faroese society. </p><p>The research is important for the establishment of Faroese identity in the present andthe past and for the understanding of Faroese society. </p><p>The History and Cultural History courses are: 2-year basic course (exam. art.), 3-yeardegree course (B.A.), 4-year degree course/major subject (cand. phil.). </p><p>There are two 1-year courses in Social Sciences: a 1-year basic course in SocialStudies and a 1-year basic course in Economics, Trade and Language. </p><p>The Department has its own library of historical literature and Nordic andinternational periodicals.
