<p align="center"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><big><big>Williamsburg Independent School
District</big></big></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><big>Acceptable Use Policy For Technology</big></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><big>Introduction</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">This policy has been formally adopted by the Williamsburg
Independent School District Board of Education.&nbsp; The provisions of this policy will
be strictly enforced by the district and appropriate action will be taken by the district
toward those persons who violate the policies contained within this AUP.&nbsp; The policy
covers use of technology in the district, including use of computers, video equipment,
telecommunicating technology such as the Internet, telephones and cellular phones, and use
of any other technology equipment in the district.&nbsp; This policy covers all users,
including students, full-time and part-time staff, parents, community members, and
visitors to the district.&nbsp; This policy also covers access to district computers and
networks by means of dial-up connections.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">The board recognizes that technology advances have led to new
and emerging ways to obtain information and to communicate.&nbsp; Schools in the past were
not linked by the global networks that are in place today, and therefore they tended to be
quite self-contained.&nbsp; That is no longer the case in this Age of Communication and
Information.&nbsp; The board supports access to the information resources available from
the global networks, but is believes that such access to information is a privilege.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Telecommunications provides access to information stored on
many thousands of computers.&nbsp; In the past, it was possible for librarians, teachers,
principals, and media specialists to screen materials brought to campus, to assure that
the materials were appropriate and met existing guidelines.&nbsp; Today,
telecommunications will open classrooms to electronic information resources which have not
been screened by educators for use by students of various ages.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><big><font face="Trebuchet MS">Agreement/Consent Forms</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">No student or other minor may directly access the Internet or
have e-mail privileges until the student or other minor has signed a form that states that
the student or minor understands the district's AUP and agrees to follow its provisions.
&nbsp; Furthermore, written parental (or legal guardian) consent will be required before a
student or other minor can directly access the Internet or have e-mail privileges.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">No adult users may access the Internet or have e-mail
privileges until he/she has signed a form that states that he/she understands the
district's AUP and agrees to follow its provisions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">All staff members are required to sign a form stating that
he/she has read the AUP and agrees to follow its provisions.&nbsp; This specifically
includes all full and part-time employees, substitute teachers, and student teachers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Teachers and others whose duties include classroom and/or
computer lab management and/or student supervision must sign an agreement acknowledging
responsibility for exercising reasonable supervision of student access to the Internet and
electronic mail and agreeing to not direct or advise students to use electronic mail
systems other than the Kentucky Education Technology system standard e-mail system while
using district computers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">The above policies governing agreement/consent forms are
requirement of Kentucky state laws and the district is required to carry out the
provisions of these laws.</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Trebuchet MS">Staff Guidance</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">The staff of Williamsburg Independent School District will
provide guidance and instruction to students in the appropriate use of resources accessed
via telecommunications.&nbsp; The Board recognizes the fundamental importance of students
requiring skills in electronic information searching and retrieval.&nbsp; The Board
recognizes the importance of electronic mail as a means of communications and believes
that students should be taught how to use e-mail properly and effectively.</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Trebuchet MS">User Responsibility</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">All users are responsible for good, ethical behavior when
using computers just as they are when in a classroom, or on a school bus, or other places.
&nbsp; Communications on computer networks are often public in nature.&nbsp; General
school rules for behavior and communications apply.&nbsp; These rules are stated in the
student and staff handbooks that the district's two schools and Central Office publish.
&nbsp; Access to computer networks, both local and global, is a privilege, not a right,
and is provided to users who act in a considerate, ethical, and responsible manner, and
may be denied to those users who do not.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">All users are responsible for maintaining the security of
their network passwords.&nbsp; Security is especially important for district staff
members.</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Trebuchet MS">The Internet</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Williamsburg Independent School District provides students
and staff with direct access to the global Internet.&nbsp; Because of the nature of the
Internet --- a vast array of computers around the world that are all connected
electronically --- it is possible for Internet users to access a huge variety of both
textual and graphical material.&nbsp; Most of the material would likely be deemed harmless
and appropriate for all ages to view, if compared with prevailing community standards.
&nbsp; However, the Internet does include both graphical and textual material that would
likely be considered inappropriate for Williamsburg students.&nbsp; This material is a
small part of the Internet, and it usually must be sought out deliberately by the user in
order to be seen.</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Trebuchet MS">Internet Access Blocking</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Kentucky state law requires the district to use blocking
software to prevent users' access to designated Internet servers.&nbsp; Sites to be
blocked are determined by a district subcommittee of the Technology Committee. &nbsp;
Because of the vastness of the Internet, the rapid changes taking place on the Internet,
and limitations inherent in any blocking software that the district might use, blocking
software cannot block all inappropriate material on the Internet although much of this
type of material will be blocked.&nbsp; The Board believes that the best approach consists
of teaching users what is appropriate material and what is not, developing trust with the
students users that they will use sound judgement in using telecommunications access
appropriately, teacher screening of materials as much as possible before student access
occurs, teachers providing supervision of students while telecommunicating, again whenever
possible, and disciplining those users who break the rules and violate the trust that was
present.&nbsp; The Internet is an exciting and interesting place to explore. &nbsp; We do
not want to teach children to fear the Internet, but, rather, to use the Internet in an
ethical, responsible manner.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Kentucky state law requires that the district monitor the log
files generated by the blocking software.&nbsp; The log files will provide data indicating
which Internet sites have been visited by district users.&nbsp; They will also record data
that can lead to the identification of users who access inappropriate sites.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Although the staff will seek to prevent users from accessing
inappropriate material on the Internet, the district will not be held responsible when
such efforts fail.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">School library media specialists, teachers, and other school
staff members have a professional responsibility to work together to help students develop
the intellectual skills needed to discriminate among information sources, to identify
information appropriate to their age and developmental levels, and to evaluate and use
information to meet their educational goals, and to use information and materials in an
ethical manner by, for example, observing copyright laws and avoiding plagiarism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Perhaps the key word in the Board policy in this matter is
responsibility.&nbsp; Students are expected to show responsibility in using information
resources appropriately.&nbsp; Younger students will need more supervision and guidance
than older students.&nbsp; Students must recognize that use of telecommunications must
relate to the educational mission of the school.</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Trebuchet MS">Parental Responsibilities</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Parents, including legal guardians, are responsible for their
children's access to the Internet and to e-mail when the children are off-campus, and the
district assumes no responsibility for such access.&nbsp; The district will prescribe what
it believes to be ethical behavior as well as inappropriate behavior, but the
establishment of standards of morality and conduct is a fundamental responsibility of the
child's parents.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">The district recognizes the important role of parents as
stakeholders in the implementation of a district AUP, and encourages all parents to voice
concerns and seek information from district employees.</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Trebuchet MS">Electronic Mail</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Kentucky state law mandates that the only permissible e-mail
system that may be used on district computers will be the standard e-mail system adopted
by the Kentucky Department of Education.&nbsp; At the present time, that standard is
Microsoft Exchange, version 5.5.&nbsp; The standard system is subject to change by the KDE
in the future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">State law also expressly prohibits use of any &quot;third
party&quot; e-mail system by users on district computers, such as Hotmail, Juno, Yahoo,
and others.&nbsp; Staff members must assume responsibility for enforcing this law.</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Trebuchet MS">Privacy</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">All users should recognize that electronic communication and
computer files are not always private.&nbsp; The district reserves the right to access
users' files, including e-mail messages, to maintain system integrity and insure that
users are using the system in accordance with this AUP and Kentucky state law. &nbsp;
Current state law requires that the district monitor users' e-mail and Internet access to
ascertain compliance with the provisions of this AUP.&nbsp; Procedures for monitoring will
be established by the superintendent using any guidelines that may be established by the
Board.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">It is a policy of this district that students may not be
identified by name when their image is posted on any district-run Web site, unless
parental permission is obtained beforehand.</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Trebuchet MS">Telephone Usage</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">District telephones are primarily for staff use. &nbsp;
Students may use the telephones under staff supervision when there exists a legitimate
need, such as calling parents to arrange transportation, delivery of medicine or clothes,
or the like.&nbsp; Students may not use the telephone for calls of a social
&quot;chat&quot; nature. Staff should refrain from use of the telephones for other than
work-related calls, especially during hours when school is in session.&nbsp; No toll calls
should ever be made that are personal in nature and not job-related if the charge will
appear on the district phone bill.&nbsp; A staff member is required to monitor student use
of the district phones if that staff member allows the student to use the phone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">All policies contained within this AUP governing
inappropriate language apply to telephone usage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">The policies contained in this AUP governing telephone usage
specifically apply to district cellular phones and other wireless telecommunication
systems.</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Trebuchet MS">Community Use</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">On recommendation of the Superintendent/designee, the Board
will determine when and which computer equipment, software and information will be
available to the community.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Upon request to the Superintendent/designee, community
members may have access to the Internet and other electronic information sources and
programs available through the district's technology system, provided they attend any
required training and sign an agreement form agreeing to follow all of the provisions of
this AUP.</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Trebuchet MS">Specific Rules For All Technology Users</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Trying to provide a complete list of rules for users would be
a daunting task, although a rule list will be given below.&nbsp; Perhaps one rule will
cover a lot of ground here.&nbsp; Let's call it the &quot;Mom&quot; Rule: If you can say
it or type it or show it to your Mom or your clergyman without being ashamed or
embarrassed, it passes the &quot;mom&quot; test and is probably OK.&nbsp; The final
decision as to what is inappropriate is the responsibility of the district administrators
and their decisions are final.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Here are a few rules about what is definitely not permitted:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Sending or displaying offensive messages or pictures</font></li>
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Using obscene language</font></li>
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Harassing, insulting, or attacking others</font></li>
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Damaging computers, computer system, or computer networks, or
    the files contained therein, including the uploading or creation of computer viruses</font></li>
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Violating state or federal laws, including copyright laws</font></li>
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Using others' passwords and/or network accounts</font></li>
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Trespassing in others' accounts, files, directories, or work,
    and harming or destroying data of another user</font></li>
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Intentionally wasting resources</font></li>
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Employing the network for commercial purposes, personal gain,
    or engaging in illegal activities</font></li>
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Posting personal information such as address or phone number
    on off-campus servers (students and minors only), unless coordinated by a parent or
    teacher</font></li>
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Activities deemed to be a security risk to the network</font></li>
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Revealing one's password to another person and/or allowing
    another person to use one's own account</font></li>
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Rebooting or turning off a computer in order to prevent a
    staff member from viewing the monitor screen</font></li>
</ul>

<p><big><font face="Trebuchet MS">Disciplinary Policy</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">And what happens when there are violations?&nbsp; There may
be loss of computer access for the guilty party.&nbsp; Additional disciplinary action may
result; the inappropriate behavior or language will be judged as a normal disciplinary
procedure --- the involvement of technology equipment does not necessarily invoke a
special set of procedures.&nbsp; When applicable, law enforcement agencies may be
involved.&nbsp; Staff members who violate AUP policies will be disciplined in accordance
with provisions in the current Staff Handbook.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Individuals found responsible for damage, theft, or vandalism
of district technology will reimburse the district for repair or replacement, and may be
liable for criminal charges.</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Trebuchet MS">District Liability</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">The district strives to provide error-free access to computer
files and Internet content, but the District cannot be held liable for any lost, damaged,
or unavailable information due to technical or other difficulties.</font></p>
