<h1>Goals and Objectives of the Williamsburg Independent School
District</h1>
<p>
Each of the two schools establishes a set of goals each year that
the staff strives to reach.  In addition, the Board of Education
establishes a set of goals for the district as a whole.  Many of
the goals are based on those of the 1990 Kentucky Education Reform
Act.  The district has been a leader in the state in implementing
reform measures.
<p>
The elementary school has focussed on the successful implementation
of the ungraded primary program, establishing an effective site-
based decision-making council, improving attendance, and reforming
the curriculum by using technology tools, adding foreign language
instruction, modernizing music education, and restructuring the
reading and writing components of the curriculum.<br>

The high school has incorporated the sixth grade students, so that
it now serves grades 6 through 12. The block schedule, consisting
of four 90 minute periods daily, was implemented in the fall of
1993. Many new, non-traditional courses were added to the curriculum, 
including interdisciplinary classes, portfolio classes, and
classes that provide real-world experiences, such as the WISD
Jacket Bank.  Attendance incentives have been emphasized, with
considerable success. Much emphasis has been placed on preparing
students for success in taking KERA-mandated testing. The high
school 12th grade had the top test scores in the state for the
1993-94 school year.
<p>
The high school has a strong emphasis on its youth performing
community service. In fact, the history students are required to
perform some community service before course credit is awarded.<br>

One community service project by history students involved the
cataloging of all grave sites in the city's large Highland Park
Cemetery.  A printed catalog was produced and made available to
interested persons at the end of the project.
<p>
The high school encourages students to get involved in club
activities.  One of the most active clubs is the SADD club. The
picture below shows SADD members sharing their message during a
parade in downtown Williamsburg.<br>

Another excellent project that involves the middle level students
is frequent visits to the local nursing home, where both the youth
and the residents get to know each other and enjoy fun activities
together.<br>
