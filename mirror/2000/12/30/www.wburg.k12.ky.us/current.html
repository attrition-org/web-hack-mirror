<h1>Current Scenes at School</h1>
<br>
<h3>A group called FLOW (Future Leaders of Williamsburg) has been formed recently.
 The pictures below show members of FLOW giving a Powerpoint presentation to
  the Williamsburg City Council concerning the new waterpark that is currently 
  under construction.  FLOW members convinced the City Council that the youth
   of Williamsburg need to be included on planning committees such as the waterpark 
   committee.  The mayor and Council agreed and asked FLOW to select two students 
   for membership.  FLOW members are also actively supporting the establishment 
   of a youth center for Williamsburg.</h3>
