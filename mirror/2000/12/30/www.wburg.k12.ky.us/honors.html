<h1>Honors and Awards</h1>
<p>
The Williamsburg Independent School District has been recognized
for excellence many times over the years, at the local, regional,
state, and national levels.
<p>
Williamsburg was chosen in 1993 as one of eight districts designated 
as <b>Technology Innovation Centers</b>.  We serve as the model
technology site for the other 30 districts in our region of the
state.  Over 250 networked computers serve a student population of
900 students and over 60 teachers and administrators.  The recently
built Media Center houses two large computer labs.<br>
