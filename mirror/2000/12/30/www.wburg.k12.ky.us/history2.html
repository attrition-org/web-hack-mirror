School</i></b></font></p>

<p><b><i><font COLOR="#0000FF">In 1909, the citizens of Williamsburg voted to consolidate
the four, one-room school districts which educated their youth in order to form a city
school system. They agreed to select one trustee from each of the churches in the
community as representatives of the Board of Education. The original group consisted of
M.J. Gross of the Methodist church, J.M. Blakely of the Congregationalist church, R.L.
Pope of the Christian church, B.F. Rose of the First Baptist Church, and W.H. Brummett of
Main Street Baptist Church.</font></i></b></p>

<p><b><i><font COLOR="#0000FF">The initial site of Williamsburg City School system was a
brick structure located on the present day site of the Anderson Building on the Cumberland
College Campus. When the building was consumed by fire in 1926 it was replaced by another
brick structure in the same location; this site housed the district until the spring of
1983 when the school occupied its present home at 1000 Main Street.</font></i></b></p>

<p><b><i><font COLOR="#0000FF">The first principal , Fleming J. Bowles, taught all high
school subjects that include physical geography, algebra, Latin and history. The first
graduating class was recorded in 1915. Soon after its establishment, the high school was
admitted to the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1927 after
adding a fourth year of study. The elementary school joined this elite organization in
1970.</font></i></b></p>

<p><b><i><font COLOR="#0000FF">The school steadily grew during the 1920's, 30's, and 40's
as various academic and athletic programs provided extended opportunities for students. In
1955, the district became among the first school systems in the state to racially
integrate their enrollment. The school has gained publicity through recognition that
include designation as a National Blue Ribbon School in 1992 and top rankings as a
district in the KIRIS testing for the state of Kentucky for the 1992-93, 1993-94, 1994-95,
and 1995-96 school years. At present, there are more than 3,500 proud alumni around the
world who serve society in roles that include doctors, attorneys, business professionals,
and educators. </font></i></b>
