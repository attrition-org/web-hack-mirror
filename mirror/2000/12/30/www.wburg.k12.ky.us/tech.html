<h1>Technology at Williamsburg</h1>
<p>
An extensive education technology program at Williamsburg began
in
the fall of 1990, with the formation of a Technology Committee.
This committee studied the district's needs for modern technology
tools in the district. After considerable discussion, visits to
model sites, and working with a consultant, the committee wrote
the
district's first technology plan, and shortly thereafter began
implementation.
<p>
The campus was completely cabled for networking computers, and
file
servers and workstations were installed in early 1991.  A
district
technology coordinator was hired to oversee the technology
program.
<p>
Since early 1991, the district has added an astonishing amount of
technology. With currently over 250 networked computers and 5
file
servers, staff and teachers have ready access to a computer
throughout the day.
<p>
Several laser printers, inkjet color printers, and many older
dot-
matrix printers are available.  A full-page color scanner is
available in the media center.  A modem server on the network
permits modem use anywhere on campus, regardless of the
availability of a telephone nearby.  Media Center users enjoy a
fully computerized card catalog.
<p>
A major step forward was achieved in the fall of 1994 with the
arrival of a IBM RS/6000 AIX server along with a dedicated 56
Kbps
data line linking WISD to a state-wide WAN. This provided the
district with effective Internet access and permitted features
such
as this WWW server to exist.  In mid-1995, the district
established
a Linux server, added TCP/IP to the classroom Novell server, and
upgraded the data line to T1 capacity.  Starting with the 1995-96
school year, all students and staff will have individual Internet
e-mail 
addresses.
<p>
The district has an excellent video production facility on
campus.
Over $ 30,000 has been spent on equipment and supplies.  An
important emphasis in the district is to employ the students
actively as workers in all phases of video production. This
interdisciplinary approach aligns quite well with the goals of
KERA
and permits the staff to use video technology as a very effective
tool toward achieving valuable outcomes.  Due to be completed in
August,
1995 is a $ 100,000 videoconferencing room, part of the Kentucky
TeleLinking
Network.  Our site will be one of 47 KTLN sites across Kentucky
using state-of-the-art
compressed video technology.
<p>
School announcements are delivered by middle level students on
<b>live</b> TV every morning. A weekly school news program,
sometimes live, is shown every Friday morning. Even the primary
students participate as workers---they give the weather report
every Friday.  The district also produces a monthly 30 minute TV
program on school issues that is shown on community cable
television.<br>
