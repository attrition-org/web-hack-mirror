Brown says this is the first time the agency has requested additional millage since 1989.  It would cost the owner of a $50,000 home about $26 a year.

"I would like to thank you for having a local job board. Since Richnet left town, this has been so helpful to our students, adult students, and others to know the jobs available in the close vicinity. Newspapers ads are one thing, but using the computer is so convenient. The employers offering their email addresses to contact or to send resumes is cost-effective and timesaving. As a job placement coordinator for a school, I have been telling all employers who call here looking for employees to use the MansfieldAreaHelpWanted.com advertising board as another resource. The national and state job web sites are good but people who are looking for local jobs do not want to go through that long list that doesn't pertain to their area. Thanks and keep up the good work."
