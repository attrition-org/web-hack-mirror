<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"SIZE="5" color="black">Would you trust a security company who cannot even secure themselves?</FONT><br><br>

<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"SIZE="3" color="black">I am continually amazed by the amount of people who buy into this immature<BR>
and
childish company. They use and abuse people, chew them up and spit them <BR>
out.
Their Retina product is one of the biggest scams to hit the<BR>
industry.
A poorly coded, slow piece of junk. <BR>
"Artificial Intelligence" .. what a
crock of shit, the AI *cough* consists of <BR>
sending characters to a port and
incrementing. <BR>
<BR>
Big deal. <BR>
<BR>
This doesn't constitute a $1200
- $3000 pricetag in my book. How these<BR>
guys managed to get venture capital
boggles the mind.<BR>
<BR>
Iris: originally a product named Spynet. Spynet
sold for a relatively low<BR>
price, around $100. The eEye boys took the product,
slapped a new<BR>
interface on and it now sells at $1700+. That's quite
an increase. No<BR>
doubt the original programmer got a raw deal.<BR>
<BR>
Marc
Maiffret/Chameleon, the "Chief Hacking Officer" : A teenage kid with<BR>
a
point-and-click skill level whose one claim to fame was defacing the<BR>
pentagon
web site.. through an open windows share. He was subsequently<BR>
raided
by the FBI after trying to exchange money given to him after<BR>
committing the
deed. A self proclaimed "security expert" ..one look at any<BR>
of the work
produced by this kid will definitely show you otherwise.<BR>
"CHAM" (Common Hacking
Attack Methods).. oh, very clever.<BR>
<BR>
Would you trust this glorified
script kiddie and his band of merry men? <BR>
<BR>
There is something wrong inside if you answered yes.<BR>
<BR>
Do not support these
bunch of idiots, they are whores in every respect and there <br> are far better
products on the market.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and to the Retina users out there
: you are not safe. <BR>
<BR>
I think a recall may be in order Marc.<BR>
