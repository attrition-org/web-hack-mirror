  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's been a long 
    time, but we're still around.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="2"><b>The 
    Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1">Everyone 
    in the world is entitled to their own privacy as a human right...
or at least they should be.
    The Government prefer to think differently. They hate the idea of
not being 
    able to have total control over everything and
everyone.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1">So 
    what do they do? They introduce a new bill (<a
href="http://www.stand.org.uk/ripnotes/">The 
    Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill</a>).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1">This 
    'New Labour' Government is a joke. This new bill has now been
passed after 
    much opposition from both normal people and businesses... and it
affects everybody.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1">They 
    intend to keep watch on everything you do on the Internet. Every
little packet 
    you send and receive. Every site you visit. Every person you talk
to. Every 
    e-mail you send. Everything.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1">They 
    will take away every shred of privacy you have left.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1">The 
    fact is, the Government are scared of the Internet. They are
oblivious to 
    it. They can't control it... and that scares them.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1">New 
    Labour are 'control freaks' so to speak. They are attempting to
police the 
    Internet in a way that they would their own country. It just won't
work.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1">Sure, 
    use PGP, good encryption. Ah... but wait... if you refuse to hand
over your 
    PGP passphrase to the Police you face up to a 2 years imprisonment
and/or 
    a fine. Pathetic!</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1" color="#999999">-</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1">This isn't just a UK problem, far from it. If you are not aware already, 
    there is the international 'Cybercrime Treaty' which, if passed, will mean 
    that publishing any sort of exploits, security problems, etc. on the net would 
    be illegal. What a joke!</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1">Countries 
    need to research very deeply into the impact of these decisions
BEFORE 
    implementing them.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1">Software 
    companies rely on security holes and patches being released by
hackers in 
    order to make their software as secure as it can be. Exploits are
an essential asset for the
    administrator both to help their understanding of the security
flaw and in order to test their systems for the
vulnerability.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1">All 
    pretty harmless and very useful security related sites which
Administrators 
    rely on to make sure their servers are up to date with the latest
patches 
    would be illegal.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1">Bugtraq, Alldas, Attrition, etc. and even the discussion of security 
    holes and exploits would be deemed as illegal if this Cybercrime Treaty is 
    passed.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9933">The 
    reason for this defacement is to make people, the media, etc. aware that their 
    Government's are trying to strip them of their freedom and privacy by attempting 
    to monitor their every move.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="1">&quot;Why 
    even bother? You won't make a difference.&quot; you may ask.
Simple... Because 
    we can, and we will. There is no harm in trying to make a
difference and it's 
    better than just sitting back and doing nothing at all.</font></p>
