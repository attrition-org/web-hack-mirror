Ok, I tried to help you guys out, I found a security flaw in your system per chance, I wasn't sitting here for hours trying to screw your site up, you didn't piss me off or anything.  When I gained access to your system, I just changed something subtle, very simple, to get your attention.  I disabled the program that I gained access through, HP OpenView OmniBack, first off I don't really understand why in the hell the program is using an external port anyhow, I figure its some kind of backup program, why does it need to be open to everyone on gods green earth.
Anyhow, I figured that once you saw what I did you would be really pissed off at first, then maybe a little grateful to me for the mere fact that I didn't fuck everything up, I even told you what i did/changed.  This time your lucky that I didn't do anything harmful, I really was going to, when i realized you reenabled the program that I disabled for you, I was quite annoyed.  My first instinct was to totally destroy everythin.  A good friend of mine
saved your day, he told me I should just make it more clear to you.  So here it is.  Have a nice day, a merry xmas, and a happy holiday.
P.S DO NOT reenable the program again, without patching it, or at least putting up a simple firewall.... your the best fucking quake player in the world, and you can't read a fuckin FAQ on how to setup a simple firewall.
