Hello boys and girls!  This is Nytek speaking up, (and Cha0z says hi too).
I'd just like to say that there is way too much hating going on in this
world.  The Arabs hate the Jews, the Jews are hating the Arabs, nations
are hating each other, and war is the end result.  Now, for all of you who
saw some of my older defacements, I talked about how war is hell with
p4ntera and Om3ga of ph33r-the-b33r (What up guys?), and for all of you
wondering, yes they are all some nice people in that group.<br>
<br>
Now, what I'm trying to say is that the major thing a LOT of countries
possess in this modern time, it's nuclear capabilities.  We don't think
about this, but most countries that do have the ability to launch nukes,
also have the ability to single-handedly kill everyone in the world
multiple times over.  This is bad.  In that obliterated world, will lay
your lovers, your children, your parents, your friends, and everything you
ever cared about... and hey, even you. I just want the people who read
this to think twice about turning to violence, especially now durning the
holidays.  I don't mean just nukes, I mean.. just because you don't take a
life doesn't mean it's wrong.  Hurting people in any way is just as bad
sometimes, and can lead to lifelong scarring, etc. <br>
<br>
To get more personal, I'd like to say to the people bashing Israel via
defacements... shut up.  You do nothing but cause headaches for some
admins, and you make anyone but the people in your country cringe.  For
the Israelies, don't yell back and don't start anything.  I cannot tell
them to stop because I have missed posts where the Israeli is bashing the
Arab.  So Maybe I missed it.  Hitler crew.  I'm glad you're gone.  Peraps
you realized how foolish your operation was and turned over a new
leaf.  
<br><br>
And now the typical shout section! Oh joy!
