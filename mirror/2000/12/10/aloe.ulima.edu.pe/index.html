Choose Windows. Choose the Millennium.
Choose engineering with a fucking mouse.
Choose IIS. Choose SQL Server.
Choose VB, IE, ASP, and a fucking big NT...
Choose SMB and end up wondering why your passwords are on that shitty site.
Choose not to choose. Let Micro$oft do it for you.
<!--Choose Windows. Choose 95.
Choose a fucking debugging career.
Choose IIS. Choose a big NT workstation.
Choose VB, IE, ActiveX players and electrical tin openers...
Choose VISA and end up wondering who the fuck you are on a Sunday morning.
Choose a future. Choose Micro$oft!-->

But why would I want to do a thing like that?

I choose not to be chosen: I choose something else.
The reasons? There are too many reasons.
And who needs reasons when you've got Linux?
