          Silicon Toad (a.k.a. &quot;<i>Jason</i>&quot;); Attrition.org (for putting

          by mirroring Attrition's hack list); to all the sysadmins who have understood 
          over the years what hacking is and asked us how to fix their servers 
          properly, and for understanding that we're not here to destroy, but 
          to help get the point across and further security as a whole; to all 
          our friends who have followed us for the past 7 or so years and wished 
          us luck in all possible ways; to all those that are just learning and 
          have befriended someone who is willing to teach them; to all of our 
          equals around the world who contribute to the same cause and with great 
          effort, we're all the same -- we learn to help others; to The Mentor 
          for inspiring all of us, at some point, to strengthen our convictions 
          and spirits regarding computer security and education; and, of course, 
          to all of our moms around the world who looked the other way while we 
          were all doing this as teenagers. ;O)</font></p>

          you are willing to learn, we are also willing to teach (apparently you

          well, we're back!). Email us with your questions and we will tell you 
          what to do. Some technologies we use are not patchable, but many are. 
          We are willing to run various security checks on your server for free 
          and send you a copy of your network report from the various programs 
          we made used during this hack (if available). No need to tell us any 
          information to prove it's you, we know your Email address.</font></p>

        Right... YOU've Been Hacked... TWICE!</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You 
        have been hacked (yet again) by the infamous hack team, DreamScape. This 
        is definitely not the first time we've hacked, nor the last. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">To 
        introduce ourselves, we're a hacking group that's been around a long time, 
        even before Attrition was commissioned and even before they became known 
        for mirroring hacked WebSites. Just recently, the old <i>Generation 3</i> 
        crew got together and decided it was time to start defacing pages again. 
        Yes, there is a reason for Generation <i>3</i> instead of something else. 
        &quot;Generation 3&quot; means that this is the third group of hackers 
        put together for the DreamScape Team, and also the smallest of all generations 
        (17 was the most).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
        would also like to notify everybody that this Team is no longer commissioned 
        by NightKingdoms Progressive as a hacking team and is not responsible 
        for any actions or behaviors that we may endeavor. It's just that the 
        DreamScape Team is deeply rooted with the history of NightKingdoms Progressive 
        and we all know the history of this group. We do this for fun as well 
        as show just how vulnerable server security is in our spare time.</font></p>
