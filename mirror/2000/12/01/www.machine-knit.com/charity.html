<p>This group needs donations of used machines and yarn to continue this worthwhile
mission!<br>
<br>
<i>Fiber Arts Ministry of the Quincy Free Methodist Church</i><br>
&quot;Our church has started a machine knitting group with 3 machines. We live<br>
in an agricultural area that has many poor families and transient workers.<br>
We knit hats and mittens for these kids. In order to get more people<br>
involved, I was looking for a way to reach machine knitters that have old<br>
machines tucked away in their closets. <br>
Our main focus is to get women in our community together for this<br>
cause. We feel that people working together for a common good really<br>
strengthens our community. But now with the internet, I guess we can<br>
think in terms of our world community! Thanks so much for your interest!&quot;<br>

<p>I just wanted to share with you all about our latest club project.<br>
Yesterday we met from 9 till 4. Club members either brought their own<br>
machines or shared with someone else. We knitted toboggans all day.<br>
<br>
It was a wonderful day. Everyone brought odds and ends of yarn and we<br>
just put them all together so everyone could choose whatever to knit<br>
with. If one person used a pattern we all liked, we could try it in<br>
different color combinations. Some people were knitting, some were<br>
sewing up, and we got my daughter to make pompoms. We laughed all<br>
day...told jokes...even sang a little! <br>
Everyone had brought a brown bag lunch, and we had our lunch break at<br>
noon. One member even brought yummy chocolate chip cookies to help keep<br>
our energy level up! We talked about the recent seminars we'd been to<br>
and other things we'd like to see.<br>
<br>
As the day wore on, we began putting the finished hats in a chair. By<br>
4:00 the chair was full of all sorts of colors and patterns and stripes!<br>
We'd all used just a couple of basic patterns, but it was really fun to<br>
see how each hat was such an individual thing.<br>
<br>
We plan to take our toboggans to an elementary school near us. It's in a<br>
older section of town and many of the kids come from low income families.<br>
We'll give our hats to the principal of the school and she can<br>
distribute them to the ones that need them. So I guess we're twice<br>
blessed: we had a great day together and some child will have a little<br>
bit warmer winter.<br>
<br>
I know many clubs do charity work all year round, and we have a charity<br>
box that our members fill up on a regular basis. But this is the first<br>
time we've taken a day and knitted together. Considering the good time<br>
we had, I'm sure it won't be the last!<br>

<p>Dear Fellow Knitlisters,<br>
I'm not sure if this is an appropriate posting to the list, so if it<br>
isn't I apologize in advance.<br>
Several months ago I started working as a Nurse Practitioner here on the<br>
Crow Creek Indian Reservation in South Dakota, where the winter winds are<br>
extremely bitter and cold. While most of my patients seem to be dressed<br>
warmly, I have seen children, teens and adults who come to the clinic<br>
without warm clothes. When I ask them, &quot;Do you have a warm hat or<br>
mittens?&quot; they simply say &quot;No.&quot;<br>
Like the rest of you, my knitting machine is busy churning out last minute<br>
Christmas gifts for my family. But I've decided to spend January using up<br>
part-cones of yarn to make some warm hats, mittens &amp; socks. Our talented<br>
and tireless public health nurses who make home visits can distribute the<br>
knitwear to those who need it most. We serve an area of 1000+ people, and<br>
poverty is a terrible reality here.<br>
If any of you wish to donate knitwear, please email me privately for an address to send it
to.<br>
Thanks in advance.<br>

Some of the members of the Bond Users email list are tossing around ideas to form a
knitting group similar to the MK List's Knit-A-Longs. One of the ideas was for a Baker's
Dozen Club, where they would work on a project a month, plus one for charity. The basic
concept comes from Melissa Ark, and Linda Boudreau has generously offered up a pattern to
get it started.<a HREF="patterns/Afghan/Angelghan.htm">Melissa's Angelghan-January's Angel of
