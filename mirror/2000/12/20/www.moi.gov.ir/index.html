        <td>Cutie, huh?<p>Yeah... I앐 sure that you앏l have a
        nice Christmas, with a lot of food and gifts, while many
        poor people are dying on the corner, on the trash or
        wherever.... is it fair? I don앖 think so.</p>
        <p>But it압 NOT a Govern압 fault. No... not the
        ambicious people압 either. It압 OUR fault. Yeah, a
        hacker압 fault. WE are bad people. Were delinquents.
        We make people spend a lot of money because of our
        attacks. </p>
        <p>It압 right, isn앖 it, FBI? It압 what you want to
        hear, isn앖 it? WE are bad, aren앖 we? The president,
        the majors and all the others politicians are nice
        people, who want to make the world a good place to live,
        but WE, hackers, don앖 let the world be a nice place,
        right? that압 true, in앖 that? (tags are so boring,
        aren앖 they? =). Yes, there are many people dying
        hungry, because we hack! If it wasn앖 us, the world앇
        be a very nice place, everyone would be happy, no one앇
        be poor, everybody앇 eat a lot and get many gifts on
        Christmas, there앇 happen no wars, Africa wouldn앖 be
        poor.... yeah... the World would be wonderful! But we
        don앖 let it happens! Were very bad, really!</p>
