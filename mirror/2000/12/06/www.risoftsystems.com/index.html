<br><br>I'm very sorry but your webpage has 
  been hacked because<br>
  <b><font size="4" color="#6600FF">you have been using IIS, a very crappy web 
  server. It is filled <br>
  with bugs. So, get the hotfix from MS today 
  and you will be<br>okay. If you need more 
  info on this, you should check out any<br> computer 
  security related websites. <br><br>
	A malicious cracker could have broken into your computer and deleted all<br>
	of your files. I'm sorry the information had to come to you this way.

<br>I'm sick of this prison planet called earth. Why are we at the edge of the galaxy?<br>
We were all put here for a reason. The people who put us here, are checking up on us<br>
(UFO sitings) here and there. When will you wake up and realize that you are being <br>
controlled by people at the top? Skeptics are even farther away from realizing then<br>
most of us.<br><br>I would like to say what's up to all the hackers out there.<br> Greetz

</font> <br>I know you don't know me but you guys are cool yo.<br><br><font color=red><b>
I'm also fed up with all the bad treatment that hackers get. Shit's got to stop. Now.<br>
<font color=yellow>FREE KEVIN! -- oh, he's already out. Sorry. Well, Let the bastard be then!
<br><br><font color=lime> What's up with this presidential election huh? Talk about being tainted huh?<br>
How about none of them get elected! <br><br>

<br>OKAY, OKAY, I'm DONE.
