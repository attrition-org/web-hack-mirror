<!--- legal shit? for a defacement? yeah, just to exempt un-affiliates
the Data Masters are in no way, shape, or form affiliated
with any of the people mentioned in the greets, the OpenBSD project
or slackware linux. so dont get pissed at them because they had
nothing to do with this hack.

<p align=center><font size=1 face=Arial>Sorry kids. We
accidentally shot Santa this year.<br>
There won't be any train set for little Timmy this year, or any
'Easy Bake Oven' for little Jane.<br>
No, but we did the best we could to scrounge up something, just
something, for the kids.<br>
We didn't have many materials really, just some dusty old
computers and an internet connection.<br>
Then we had an idea. We came online and found servers, <B>lots</B>
of servers. There was something special about these<br>
servers though - they were easily hacked. They were all easily
accessed and exploited to be defaced.<br>
I am not going to say that these domains were hacked using any
special vulnerabilities or anything, because most weren't.<br>
<I>They were exploitable to holes which are well-known
throughout the security world.</I><br>
Well known. That means that lots of people <B>could</B>
have hacked them. But it was us. Whether that be good or bad in
your opinion, we did.<br>
Well, I know that people are still going to criticize us, not to
mention the defacing community in general, no matter what we do or
say but<br>
I am still going to say that this mass defacement was not
intended to cause any harm. All indexes have been backed up, no
files were stolen,<br>
no backdoors were placed, and the only things deleted were
certain entries in the logs for anonymity purposes. When at all
possible, admins have been mailed.<br>
We did this in an attempt to raise awareness about security. Some
of the defaced sites may have been running Microsoft's <br>
IIS server. If so, then we strongly encourage the admin(s) of
those sites to consider moving to a more secure operating system.
Suggested ones<br>
include </font><a href=http://www.openbsd.org><font size=1
face=Arial>OpenBSD</font></a><font size=1 face=Arial> or </font><a
href=http://www.slackware.com><font size=1 face=Arial>Slackware
Linux</font></a><font size=1 face=Arial>. Otherwise, a the
site was probably comprimised by an insecure cgi script or
exploitable running service<br>
was improperly configured or was out of date. Again we remind
people to apply all relevant patches to all parts of their system
periodically.<br>
<B>So admin, consider this early warning to be your
Christmas present. ;-)</B><br>
After all, isn't it better us than a malicious hacker?<br>
Now that all that is said and done, on to the usual stuff.</font></p>
