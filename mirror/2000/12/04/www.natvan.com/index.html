<center>This site has been hacked because it encourages white supremacy.</center><br>

There is now documented, scientific evidence as to the origins of race. However, I imagine
the people who run this site either don't know about it or don't want <i>you</i> to know
about it as it undermines the principles of racism and white supremacy.<br><br>

What does this evidence comprise? Well, comprehensive genetic research has established two
main facts about mankind:<br><br>
<ul>
	1. Through mitochondrial DNA analysis it has been proven that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>all</i> women have one - and only one - common ancestor.<br><br>
	   
	2. If any persons genome is traced back far enough, it can be proven that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have a common ancestor with any person of any race.<br>
</ul><br>

For those without sufficient intelligence to work out the consequences of the above two
statements, I'll spell it out: no matter if you're black/white/asian/whatever, you <i>are</i>
related to every other human on the face of the earth. This means, of course, that no race
can be deemed 'superior' to another, as we are all a mixture of each other.<br><br>

I'm not going to waste my time typing loads of shit you won't agree with, so I'll leave by saying
one thing: wise up. Different races of people will continue to evolve as the generations go by, so 
get used to it. The only way to stop it would be to have a successful holocaust, and <i>nobody</i>
wants that. Learn to live and love people on a personal basis, not from their 'background'. Remember
it's your background too, whether you like it or not.<br><br>

Admin: I've deleted all your files and made no backups. I only hope you have no backups either.
