Look at what these sick fucks are doing to animals:
</center><br><br>
These people are selling drugs(not pot)to kids or any one they
can get too buy it. People that use drugs just have a problem
and should be helped but, drug dealers should be laid down and
shot in the head. These sick people cut the vocal cords out of
pit bulls' throats so they will not bark at people passing or cops.
All these dogs are slaughtered by the police from raids on drug
houses. Is there better ways too deal with this? Maybe and maybe
not except too do what ever we can too these people who do this
to these innocent dogs. Pit bulls have been exploited for a long
time, being used in dogs fights and now for this bull shit. These
sick people are doing this when the dogs are as young as 8 weeks
old! They use other ways too take them out such as burning them
out. I think Vets who perform this operation should be placed in
jail for doing this. All they want is the quick $$$ which is
redicolous. Police and Animal Control are allowed too seize these
dogs but, why would they try too keep alive a vicious dog that
might be trying too harm them when they can't even do it with a
human? Please email rootshellhackers@hushmail.com for information
