<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif"><B>Transsexual</B>? <B>Transgender</B>? <B>M2F</B>? <B>F2M</B>? <B>Intersexed</B>? You mean a <B>CD</B> isn't referring to a compact disc and <B>TV</B> isn't talking about television?<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">If you've never had anything to do with someone who questions their gender, then those names and acroyns probably sound strange, confusing, and maybe even frightening.
