<FONT SIZE="+2">About Us</A></FONT><BLOCKQUOTE>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif"><B>TransFamily of Cleveland</B> was founded to provide support and education for transgendered persons, their families, friends and significant others. We are associated with <B>PFLAG</B> to promote awareness of transgender persons and their issues. We are also associated with <B>SSAFE</B>, to bring awareness to our school systems, through their principals and counselors, by offering literature, speakers, consultation and support.<P> 

<IMG SRC="library/graphics/bobkaren.jpg" align=left><IMG SRC="library/graphics/spacer.gif"><B>TransFamily Of Cleveland</B> was formed by Karen and Bob Gross as a result of their efforts to find a support system to help them deal with their own child's transition. They met in high school and have now been married for 35 years. Bob has a Master's Degree in Business and works as a CPA. Karen has a Bachelors in Education and taught school for several years. She now splits her time between being Bob's office manager, running her own business (helping new mothers in the first weeks after childbirth), and <B>TransFamily</B>. Together, they have traveled throughout the country speaking to groups and <b>PFLAG</b> chapters campaigning for transgender issues. Bob and Karen also contributed a chapter to Mary Boenke's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0966327217/transfamilyofcle" target="mainbody">Trans Forming Families: Real Stories About Transgendered Loved Ones</a>.<P>

<font color=9f0fcb><font size=4><IMG SRC="library/graphics/spacer.gif"><I>"My name is Karen Gross, and I started <b>TransFamily of Cleveland</b>.   I 
am the mother of a 30 yr old FTM "child" who came out to us about 5 yrs ago. 
 I would have loved to have someone like the folks on this site to talk 
with. I guess that's why I started <B>TransFamily</B> - so that others can have what I 
missed."  <P>

<IMG SRC="library/graphics/spacer.gif">"I knew from the beginning I would support my child and never kicked him "out 
of the family nest." But, I didn't understand why this had to happen.  I still 
don't, and probably never will. However, my child is so much happier and leading a 
better life because of his transition, so I will accept my child and whatever it is he 
has to do to be a happier person." </I><P> </font></font>
