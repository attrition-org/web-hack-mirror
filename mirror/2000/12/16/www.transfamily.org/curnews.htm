<img src="http://www.transfamily.org/library/graphics/worry.jpg" align=right><img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif"><B>What, me worry?  You'd better believe it.<P></B>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Sorry we're late. When the Florida Election Commission offered to copy-edit this month's issue as soon as the election was over, it seemed like a good idea at the time...<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">The November TransFamily meeting was, once again, a truly memorable one. Susan Davis conducted her annual  "candle light" ceremony. One by one everyone at the meeting came forward and lit a candle to remember someone who has made an impact on their trans-life. Supportive parents were remembered, mentors, dear friends, and cherished family members among others. Quite a few people honored TransFamily itself, while still more passed loving honor to Bob and Karen Gross.<P> 

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">WJW Fox 8 ran their feature on the November TransFamily meeting on November 20th during their 10 pm newscast. Grand total airtime, including opening and closing remarks by Tim Taylor... 5:16.  All in all, I thought it was a respectful and sensitive look at our community. There were a few questionable "stock" shots added to embellish the story.... but nothing worth getting bent out of shape over. Hopefully, the next time a TV crew comes, we can continue to improve understanding.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">December is a spiritual month for many of us. Some of us have Chanukah, others have Christmas. This is the season of giving.  As we move closer to these holidays, and approach the year 2001,  let us all continue to be thankful for the tolerance, understanding, and support that most of us enjoy in our lives. Let us remember and embrace those who don't have this kind of support. Let us open our hearts to those whose hearts are hurting <P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">I would like to call everyone's attention to a wonderful feature article that appeared recently in the Los Angeles Times. <B>Through the Gender Labyrinth</B> details the life of Lynn Conway, an M2F who played a very significant role in the development of modern computers. Conway's pain and struggle make what many of us experience seem like a cake walk in comparison. I'm grateful to Ms. Conway for all of her sacrifices to help our community.  Read the article at <a href="http://www.latimes.com/print/magazine/20001119/t000111062.html" target="mainbody">

<H2><font color=ff0000><CENTER>The Four Therapists</H2></font> 
<H3><font color=0000ff>By Diane Frank</H3></font></CENTER>

<blockquote>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In collecting information about mental health professionals who can provide assistance to people with gender and sexuality issues, it occurred to me that some discussion of what exactly that assistance can be would also be helpful. </FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">First of all, this profession can help sort out whether difficulties we face are neurochemical problems or not. Depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and other mental disorders may be caused by variations in brain or body chemistry that can be modified by appropriate, monitored use of psychoactive drugs.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Other difficulties may be due to how we perceive life. Our outlook as influenced by our upbringing and experience will give us one view, but it is not always the only perspective. Another person's viewpoint can be invaluable. Friends are often our first choice for this kind help, but professionals generally have a broader range of experience, training and understanding to offer when problems get serious.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We may engage in habitual behavior that we desire to change. In some cases, working with a mental health professional, or participation in one of a plethora of 12-step programs can facilitate the desired change in behavior. In other cases, it is not the behavior that needs changing so much as our own perception of the behavior.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Finally, looking forward, as we deal with our own issues, we must also deal with the impact on society, the workplace and the people near and dear to us. Guidance and perspective on how to achieve a satisfactory outcome and planning one's approach can be very important.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There's a joke with a kernel of truth:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Q: How many psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb?</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A: Just one, but the light bulb really has to want to change.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Seeking help from a mental health professional is pointless if one is not willing to put in the hard work and be open to change. Help may not come cheaply, and the time a professional has is not infinite. If you are not committed to the work, then you can inadvertently be depriving some one else of needed time and wasting your own money.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On Thursday, October 5th, 2000 four therapists made brief comments and answered questions about their practices at the monthly Trans-Family meeting. The therapists were Antone Feo Ph.D., his associate Diane Mueller LPCC, Brooke Kroto, LISW and Mer&acirc;l Crane, M.A., LPCC. While the group was primarily focused on the needs of trans-sexuals, there was a substantial amount of discussion about cross-dressing issues.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One question that came up immediately was why was it so hard to find therapists. Mer&acirc;l Crane pointed out that she had rough sailing in the early years of her practice and has been selective about where and how she publicizes it since. The lay public expects that gender issues are a curable disease, and tends to focus anger and blame on therapists who don't endorse that uninformed position.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Several questions pursued the area of the person who isn't certain what they are dealing with and what tools therapists might use helping these people. Ms. Kroto explained that part of the job was to facilitate the process of self discovery, to help people tease apart the issues and explore possibilities. Dr. Feo remarked that a key function is to help the client deal with inappropriate shame and guilt. While there are some formal guidelines for classification, Mer&acirc;l Crane felt that these tools had the potential for misuse and preferred to discuss them only in the context of a therapist-client relationship.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Dr. Feo made an interesting response to a question that proposed that unlike transsexuality, cross dressing itself was an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Dr. Feo asserted that crossdresser's desire to cross dress is unaffected by treatment with Luvox&#153; , a medication known to help control obsessive compulsive behavior. Connected to this discussion was the assertion, apparently agreed to by all the therapists, that there was no means of dealing with the desire to cross dress except dressing, no matter how much the person wished to eliminate the behavior.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Diane Mueller  has 20 years of experience in community mental health and has been working very happily for the past year with Dr. Feo. She enjoys couples work, adolescents and families in addition to gender issues. One of her present activities is facilitating a MtF therapy group. In choosing a therapist she recommend checking for experience and background and making sure that one feels comfortable with the person and the flow of communication.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Dr. Feo's 12 years of experience started cold helping a transvestite in the context of other psychological problems. His practice has grown in this area since, including forensic psychology and human sexuality. He added to Ms. Mueller's remarks that you shouldn't have to be responsible for teaching your therapist. You can find further information on Dr. Feo's practice at his web site:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Brooke Kroto, a licensed clinical social worker, light heartedly describes herself as a female-to-female because her contact with the gender community has led to a reawakening and renewed sense of valuing her own femininity. Ms. Kroto's training is primarily in the area of trauma and dealing with the adult consequences of childhood trauma. With only four years experience, she considers herself a novice in the gender field, adding that the gender population is not about disorder and pathology. Since everyone starts with no experience, Ms. Kroto remarked that the sense of connection one makes with a counselor and philosophical alignment can be crucial to a good outcome. She practices out of offices in Rock River and Richmond Heights.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Mer&acirc;l Crane believes that her minority childhood in a mixed religion family in Islamic Turkey gives her personal insight into the business of leading a double life. Her involvement in the gender community began back in 1973 in the Cambridge, Massachusetts. In addition to extensive credentials in gender and sexual issues she also has training in couples work. </FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In terms of selecting a therapist, Ms. Crane believes that gender issues are an uninvited dilemma faced by otherwise healthy people. Therefor the professional stricture of not befriending patients can be inappropriate. Ms. Crane's practice, The Gender Dysphoria Program of Central Ohio, is located in the Columbus area.</FONT>

For those who need to be concerned about registering for the draft, here are the facts straight from the Selective Service Administration: <P>

<blockquote>

<B>Individuals who are born female and have a sex change are  not required to register. U.S. citizens or immigrants who  are born male and have a sex change are still required to
 register. In the event of a resumption of the draft, males  who have had a sex change can file a claim for an exemption  from military service if they receive an order to report for
 examination or induction.<P></B>

On October 26, I interviewed Anne Rice live on stage at New York's 92nd St. Y, an event co-sponsored by the Y and The New York Times. Anne Rice discusses her new novel, "Merrick," the latest in her Vampire Chronicles, but she also talks about her return to the Catholic Church, why "Memnoch the Devil" is her favorite among her Vampire novels, <B>and why she is</B>, she says, "<B>a gay man trapped in a woman's body</B>."

<H2><font color=ff0000><CENTER>Reasons To Cherish Being Transsexual</H2></font> 
<H3><font color=0000ff>By  Jennifer Diane Reitz</H3></font></CENTER>

<blockquote>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Because being transsexual is often so hurtful, so filled with sadness and longing, with shame and loss and difficulty, it is easy to come to the conclusion that the whole thing is utterly a curse, perhaps inflicted by arcane and evil ancient gods.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Oh, probably.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">But there is an upside too. Most human lives are utterly mundane, devoid of any real uniqueness; the average person somnambulates through an existence devoted to filling the roles expected of them.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">But to be a transsexual is a magical, wondrous thing.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Consider. We are given many gifts in compensation for the terrible loss of our childhood as ourselves, and for the pain we endure. We are by some as yet unknown mechanism statistically far more intelligent, as a class, than perhaps any other kind of people. We are almost universally more creative, and we often possess incredible levels of courage and self determination, demonstrated by our very survival, and ultimate attainment of our goal. We are rare as miracles, and in our own way, as magical, or so has been the belief of all ancient cultures on the earth.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">We are given awareness that others would never experience, understanding of gender, of the human condition, of society and the roles and hidden rules unquestioned within it. We are given a window into the lives of both sexes, and cannot help but be, to some degree, beyond either. From this we have a rare opportunity: to choose our own life, outside predetermined and unquestioned definition or role. We can do new things, original things, only because our experience is so unique.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">We get to be true shape shifters, and experience the sheer wonder of melty-wax flesh and a real rebirth into the world. Our brains and bodies gain benefit from having been bathed in and altered by the hormones of both sexes. We appear to retain our visible youthfulness where others wrinkle, and for years longer. We possess neural advantages from both sexes, such as the language advantages of the feminized brain, and the spatial abilities of the masculinized brain both. We are shocked into waking up, if we allow it, to a life we create for ourselves ... we are not automatically doomed to sleepwalk through life.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">After our transformations, after the full-moon lycanthropic miracle that the modern age affords us, we can live lives of success and love, and genuine specialness, if we choose. If we can get past our upbringing, past the programming, the bigotry, the messages of disgust from the culture around us, if we can stand as ourselves in freedom, then our special gifts grant us a heritage of wondrous power.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">We have a proud and marvelous history. In ancient days we were magic incarnate. We were Nadle, Winkte, Two-SouIs, Shamans and healers and magical beings to our communities. We possessed the ability to give the blessings of the gods and spirits, and were prized as companions, lovers, and teachers.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">We were the prize gift of ancient tribes, entertainers, designers and dreamers. Sometimes we were the-somewhat reluctant-rulers of empires, and the consorts of emperors. We were champions and warriors too, we were feared for our unique gifts turned to inevitable victory.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Know that it is only in recent centuries, with the rise of the single minded, monolithic and monotheistic desert religions, filled with harsh single gods and twisted, narrow morals, that our kind have become reviled, the objects of scorn. Once, we were the kin of the gods.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">To be transsexual is not easy, and it is not a birth that could be envied, but neither is it a damnation. It was once considered a rare wonder, if a mixed one; a faery gift that cuts as it blesses.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">And in the modem age, of hormones and surgery, we are the first generations of our kind to finally know the joy of complete transformation, of truly gaining our rightful bodies. No other transsexuals in history have been so fortunate.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">I say that we are unicorns, rare and wondrous, with still a touch of ancient magic and the kinship of the gods. Though it is agony, beyond the fire we have the opportunity to become alchemic gold.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">We have much to add to the world, and to give to ourselves and those who love us.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">We have always been, we are still the prize of the tribe, for only the world around us has changed, the desert harshness branding us vile. We are still the same.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Our compensations are real, and our lives are special; we have but to grasp the gifts born of our sufferings.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">When I look around me at the mundane lives, there are times I think that maybe I am glad I was born transsexual, for I would never have been what I have become without that curse I cannot help but be grateful for my uniqueness, so I am brought to a strange revelation:<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Deep down, I cherish having been born a transsexual.<P>

<B><CENTER>Be a unicorn with me, and cherish it too.<P></CENTER></B>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">SPRING HILL - November 15, 2000 -- Inside the ladies' room, Aleisha King felt like one of the girls. Standing in front of the mirror in a cocktail dress and heels, the blue-eyed redhead checked her hair and makeup and joined in on the after-hours banter among several exotic dancers who had gone to Denny's last month for breakfast after the late shift. <P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">It wasn't until King headed back to the table that the trouble started. "She's pretty for a guy, isn't she?" shouted one of the dancers to a male friend across the dining room. <P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Then things turned ugly, King said. <P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">First, the man across the room shouted anti-gay slurs at King, 37, who is part way through the sex-change process and lives as a woman. Then, the man walked over, grabbed King's arm, spun her around and demanded to know if she was a man. <P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">King, while hurt and embarrassed, thought the incident was over after restaurant employees called police and the man walked out of the restaurant. She had been a regular at Denny's on weekends for more than a year and had never before had a problem. <P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Two days later, though, the phone rang at Differences Pub on Kass Circle, where King tends bar and performs as a female impersonator. King said a night manager at Denny's talked first to her boss, then called back and told her that the ladies' room would be off-limits to King and other transgendered people who had frequented the restaurant on weekends after the pub closed at 2 a.m. The manager also suggested that Lynne Greene, who owns Differences, stand guard outside the bathroom door when King and the others went inside. To King, the new rules made no sense. "I can take my makeup off and still look like a woman," she said. "I know no other life." <P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">The problem escalated the following weekend, when a group from Differences went to Denny's after the pub's Oct. 29 Halloween party.  This time, police were called when a disturbance erupted between employees and Jamie Benton, 41, a female impersonator and reigning Miss Gay Hernando. Benton, who also performs as a woman at Differences but lives as a man, said employees harassed him even though he took off his makeup and donned jeans and a T-shirt before going in the restaurant, then used the men's restroom when he got there. <P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">"They were telling me that I had come out of the women's restroom, really getting right up in my face," Benton said. "They were extremely rude. They embarrassed me."  After a loud scene, in which Benton said a cook yelled at him in front of a packed restaurant, the group of eight walked out of the restaurant, leaving their food on the table. They have not been back. <P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">"Honey, if I went in there in drag and they want me to go to the men's restroom, I have no problem with it. That's fine with me just as long as I can go pee," Benton said last week. "If they had a problem with something, they should come up and say something, not carry on the way they did in front of the whole restaurant. There's a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things." <P>

<B><img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">King and Benton say the incidents prove that they will be harassed no matter what they do. They, along with other patrons of Differences, have organized a boycott of Denny's and are considering a civil rights complaint. <P></B>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Denny's manager Bill Cushman declined to discuss specifics of the incidents. He confirmed that there had been problems at the restaurant stemming from men dressed as women using the ladies' room. "I believe we have it solved," he said last week. "They've been good guests for over a year . . . We're trying to accommodate them." <P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">But Greene disagrees. Her partner and co-owner of the pub, Elaine Wanker, used to work at Denny's and the couple were at the restaurant during both incidents. Greene is considering joining in a possible claim against Denny's. "They basically want us to go away," she said. "I feel that is discrimination." <P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Jessica Archer, who is director of the Tampa-based Florida Organization for Gender Equality, said the incidents reflect a national trend of violence toward transgendered people and transsexuals. "The rule is that you use the facility of the gender that you are presenting," she said. "That rule is based on safety." <P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Archer said transgendered people often face ridicule and violence. On average, she said, more than one transgendered person has been attacked and killed every month in the United States since 1998. "This is a problem that is not just a problem of Spring Hill, but a problem of Florida and the nation," she said. "At some point we have to start putting aside our stereotypes and start appreciating people as human beings. Denny's has treated these people as walking stereotypes." <P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">In the early 1990s, the Denny's chain faced frequent charges it discriminated against African-American customers. In 1994, the chain agreed to pay $54-million to settle two class-action discrimination suits . Three years later, Denny's Spartanburg, S.C.-based parent firm, gave $1.5-million to nine civil rights organizations. <P>

<H3><font color=0000ff>By  Phyllis Frye</H3></font></CENTER>

<blockquote>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Two weeks ago, I spoke at the Annual Symposium for the Albany Law Review. It was entitled, "Sexual Orientation:  'Family' and the Political landscape for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender People (LGBT)."<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">My presentation was entitled, "Same-Sex Marriages Have Existed Legally in the United States for a Long Time Now."<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Part of my paper will be devoted to exposing the barbaric anti-family practice, not so long ago in TG history, when legally married and very loving transgendered couples were coerced to divorce by medical professionals as a condition before the transgendered partner was allowed surgery.  "To prevent same-sex marriages!"  I know that this happened a lot, but I do not have the 
data to back up the assertion in a professional journal.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Please help me expose this by circulating this to people who will respond.  If they do not have e-mail, ask them to reply to me at 5707 Firenza, Houston 77035.<P>

<B><CENTER>DEADLINE FOR REPLIES, 10 December 2000.<P></CENTER></B>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">PLEASE, if you were married before your surgery and then coerced into divorce by the doctors, contact me.  If you want it to remain CONFIDENTIAL, simply type CONFIDENTIAL on the top line.  If I do not see CONFIDENTIAL,  I will assume that it is NOT-CONFIDENTIAL.   Either way, please send me a few paragraphs that include the following:<P>

<blockquote>

<ol>

<li> The date and state and your age when you were married.

<li> The date and state and your age when you divorced prior to surgery.

<li> Yes, that you and your spouse wanted to remain married. (Even if you OR your spouse did NOT want to remain married, was it obvious that a divorce would be required by the doctors?)

<li> Yes, that the doctor coerced the divorce prior to doing surgery.

<li> The method, statement and forcefulness of the coercion to divorce.

<li> Anything else is helpfully optional, but optional none the less. your name, address, state, zip and phone (OPTIONAL) the doctor (clinic and location) who coerced your divorce (OPTIONAL) anything else, please limit to five paragraphs<P>

<H2><font color=ff0000><CENTER>GenderPAC's National Conference on Gender</H2></font> 
<H3><font color=0000ff>By  Joni Christian</H3></font></CENTER>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">To all who are interested in the future of gender: I would like you to consider doing, "Understanding 'trans' in Genderism"
for GPAC's 1st National Conference on Gender. Let's get a definition of "Genderism" so that we can show that we are not taken seriously unless we come from one box or the other. This is just as pervasive as sexism and it doesn't take too much to figure that one out. The intolerance and
indifference must stop. Help me to help all of us. If you would like to join me,  I would like you to consider being panelists for this upcoming event. Please, let me know as early as possible. The deadline is 12-15-00. Thank you for your continued support.<P>

<B>"Understanding the 'trans' in Genderism" inspires the following thoughts-<P></B>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">In these post-politically correct days, attaching the suffix "ism" to anything tends to provoke yawns, irritation or even outright hostility. This list of ism's is long and growing longer.  Categorizing the kinds of
oppression visited upon individuals and communities and labeling them 'isms' is a fine game among an academic community used to deconstruction, pseudo-marxist analysis and dialectics.  But it less than effective in evoking change in public attitudes.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">This workshop seeks to construct a new rhetorical, semiotic and activist basis for engaging in discussions which
lead to genuine social change. We focus on the issues related to people of variant gender expression, but the content and methodology is of value to all communities and interests.  In particular the use of personal narrative is stressed.  The expression of personal stories is vital to the healing of individuals and communities and is also a more  effective means of reaching
hearts, opening minds and rewriting laws than political/social theoretical constructs based on conflict fomenting patriarchal modes of discourse.  We also seek to increase awareness of the personal, social and political victories of transgendered people.  By doing so we promote role models for the young,  heroes and heroines for ourselves and  generate a positive
public image for our journey.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">This is of course my casting about and may have nothing to do with your intent.  But maybe it will be helpful.  If I were submitting a workshop on my own, I might do one on "Bridging the gap- Healing the issues that divide segments of the gender community"....but something like that should really
be done in this context by several leaders of communities...(get Rikki Anne Wilchins and Virginia Prince on the same panel ).<P>

<B><CENTER>CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS<br>
GenderPAC's 1st National Conference on Gender -- May 18-20th<P></CENTER></B>


Deadline For Submissions :  December 31, 2000<br>
Notification Process Begins On/Around: February 15, 2001<P>

GenderPAC proudly presents its 1st National Conference on Gender -- a 3-day
conference devoted to gender politics, policy, and strategy.  NCG will be
held in downtown Washington, DC at the Washington Court Hotel on May 18-20,
2001, immediately before National Gender Lobby Day on May 20-22.  NCG is
designed to bring together all the diverse communities and identities who
have a stake in gender rights: youth, feminist, gay, transgender, queer,
questioning, and straight.<P>

<B><CENTER>Conference Priorities<P></CENTER></B><P>

<ul>

<li> Strengthen the political skills of gender rights advocates and activists

<li> Make connections across the diverse communities affected by gender civil rights

<li> Educate on gender policy and political issues such as hate crimes, job discrimination, misogyny, sexual orientation, media fairness, intersex genital mutilation, and GID reform.<P>

</ul>

<CENTER><B>Proposal Review<P></B></CENTER>

All workshop and panel proposals will be reviewed by the GenderPAC staff. Considerations for selection include:<P>

<ul>

<li> Relevance to gender politics, policy, strategy and organizing

<li> Content and panelists dealing with diverse groups and communities

<li> Presenter qualifications and experience

<li> Overall strength of the submission

<li> Diverse race/gender/class/age representation among panelists and presenters<P>

</ul>

Primary consideration will be given to presentations and workshops that are issue-based instead of identity-based and appeal across a broad range of attendees.<P>

For instance, a proposed workshop on gender-based hate crimes would be given stronger consideration if it not only addressed crimes like that of Brandon Teena, but also assaults against gay men perceived as "flamboyant," sexual assaults against women, and the harassment of gender queer youth.<P>

Due to the volume of submissions, GPAC reserves the right to reject proposals or to decline to review proposals received after December 31, 2000. You will be notified of the status of your proposal beginning on or about February 15, 2001.<P>

<B><CENTER>Presenter Responsibilities<P></CENTER></B>

To keep conference registration fees at an affordable rate, presenters are asked to their volunteer time and services at NCG. In consideration of your service as a presenter, you will be able to register for the entire conference at a discounted rate of $100 (the lowest conference rate). This discounted rate includes all plenary sessions, workshops, round tables, trainings, screenings and caucuses scheduled beginning Thursday evening May 18 and concluding through Lobby Day, plus two continental breakfasts and two lunches (Friday and Saturday).  This discounted registration rate DOES NOT include special conference events or Congressional Gala on Monday, May 21st.<P>

Presenters are responsible for making their own travel arrangements. You may use your own travel agent or the travel agent for the Conference, Diane Boswell at Wilcox World Travel: 800.294.5269 x308.<P>

Presenters are responsible for securing accommodations. GenderPAC will hold its conference at the Washington Court Hotel in downtown Washington, DC.

<H2><font color=ff0000><CENTER>Alpha Omega</H2></font> 
<H3><font color=0000ff>By  Diane Frank</H3></font></CENTER>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">Last Spring (2000) Karen and Robert Gross, principal organizers of TransFamily of Cleveland, gave moving presentation on the origin of their group and their personal experience of raising the child who is now happily their son. The group meets monthly like Alpha Omega does, and I thought that attending a few of their meeting and providing some information about how those meetings work would be a good idea. Little did I know that my four-year-old nephew-in-law would start expressing gender variant preferences and that attending TransFamily meetings would become more than just a reporting assignment. In that regard, I cannot write another word without specifically thanking Bob, Karen, and Tamera for their help in digging up 
material on pediatric gender identity disorder (GID) to send to my sister-in-law.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">TransFamily meetings differ from Alpha Omega meetings in several important ways. First of all, the dinners are pot-luck and there is no fixed meeting fee. Second, although this didn't happen at the meetings I've attended so far, the group tends to break up into smaller discussion groups 
on various topics, including a circle for first time attendees. Third and most important, this group's mission is to provide support and community not only to transsexuals, and people with gender issues, it is inclusive with regard to sexuality, and provides support for family, partners, and friends as well. TransFamily is affiliated with PFLAG, Parents, and Friends of 
Lesbians and Gays.<P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">The group meetings are generally larger than ours, and it is no surprise then that 4 therapists were willing to show up for the October Meeting to provide a general discussion of their services, practices, and to answer questions. My notes from this discussion form the basis for a separate article. I would 
say that in general the discussion topics are weighty. The issues transsexuals face, unavoidable coming out, dealing with family, friends and job, medical care, passing and identification are always of concern. While cross dressers deal with some of these issues (coming out to family, maintaining relationships and passing), our concerns of managing our 
dressing, and dealing with guilt and shame are of lesser interest in this group's setting.<P>

</CENTER>

<blockquote>

LOS ANGELES - November 8, 2000 (Hollywood Reporter) - The controversial talk show hosted by Dr. Laura Schlessinger is headed for the post-1 a.m. graveyard as of next week on key CBS
stations, including the crucial markets of New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Sources said the low-rated "Dr. Laura" was due to be downgraded from morning and afternoon time slots to the overnight hours as of Monday on the six CBS-owned stations that carry the Paramount Domestic TV talk show. Insiders said Paramount executives were disappointed by the move and vowed to continue to produce the show. CBS and Paramount are corporate siblings under the Viacom banner. The downgrades are certain to deliver a crippling blow to "Dr. Laura" as CBS stations carry the show in six of the nation's top 10 TV markets. <P>

<img src="library/graphics/spacer.gif">TransFamily of Cleveland was founded to provide support and education for transgender persons, their families, friends and significant others. We hope to form an outreach group to promote awareness of transgender persons and their issues through PFLAG and to bring awareness to our school systems, through their principals and counselors, by offering literature, speakers, consultation and support.<P>
