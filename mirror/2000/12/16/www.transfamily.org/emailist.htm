<ul>

<li><strong>TransFamily Newsletter</strong><br>This is the only email way of getting the newsletter, unless someone else forwards a copy to you. <B>The list is for distribution only, which means that nobody on the list can send an email to the other subscribers on the list.</B> No one will see your email address except the list managers (Karen and Christy) and all subscriptions to the list are approved by Karen before they are added to the list. As this list is just for the monthly newsletter or other very important meeting announcements, you will probably only receive one or two e-mail's from the list per month.<P>

<li><strong>TransFamily Discussion List</strong><br>This list is for all transitioning individuals, their friends, and family; any one who would like to participate in an exchange of information on the subject. What subjects? News, advice, support, suggestions, listings for special events and house parties, requests for information, shopping opportunities, and non group get-togethers. All subscriptions are approved by Karen, to ensure that the list's confidentiality will be maintained. After requesting a subscription, please prepare a brief introduction paragraph about you and your "trans" situation. You'll be required to submit this paragraph to Karen prior to the subscription being approved. Messages are sent to the list mail box, rather than the individual, and everyone receives a copy of the message. Anyone on the list can respond to a message. If you desire to personally respond to a message, privately and off of the list, please remember to change the email address from the list to the individual's. If you're concerned about getting too many e-mail's from the list, you can subscribe to a "digest" version of this list.<P>
