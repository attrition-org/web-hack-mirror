you</P>

<P>are only polluting the scene and giving people who actually have
a</P>

<P>fucking clue a bad name. You are the shit that bathroom
cleaners</P>

<P>have to scrub off the inside of toilet seats, and besides,
nobody</P>

<P>wants to listen to some bitch with pms ranting about how she</P>

<P>./h4x0red their site in some uber31337 way. Give up, you are</P>

<P>hopeless. i just smoked hella weed and i don't know what i'm
talkin</P>

<P>about though, whats the point in making the effort to type this
email</P>

<P>when some ./kiddie like you is on the other end. geez</P>
