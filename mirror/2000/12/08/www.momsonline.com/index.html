<font color=red>this web page has been hacked.</font>

<br><br><font color=blue size=3>
the only reason I hacked www.momsonline.com is because I have a dedication<br>
to 2 moms that deserve it.<br><br><font color=white>
1) Mom, I love you. You died when I was a young teenager. It had an impact greater <br>
than anyone could possibly imagine. I can't believe our last conversation was an<br>
argument...the next day you had the car accident. I will NEVER FORGET YOU. EVER.
<br><br>
2) I'm very saddened by the miscarriage of Clohe, she was only several weeks old.<br> I'm sorry,
and sad. This is something that will have to be lived with forever.
</font>
<br><br>
Sorry admin,<br>No files are deleted. Old index.asp, now index.bak. There's no point in deleting. Real hackers<br> don't steal or delete
databases.
<br><br>
I'm sorry this had to happen to your webpage, and this might put your job in check but it shouldn't.<br>
The one reason why this page was hacked, is because your company chose to use a buggy version
of IIS.<br> You also might want to check security websites often as your domain name is very<br>
much in the open.<br><br>
I actually really think that you are lucky because, you would have been hacked sooner or later<br>
and you probably would have lost all of your files to a malicious cracker (not hacker).
The security is so bad, <br>I can't believe that you have not been hacked before. MS needs to get
their act together.<br> Millions of websites are on thier knees to anyone that
can type letters into a URL because of IIS.<br> When will they wake up? When will you think about
putting a little bit of security into this important domain? 
<br>Your computer has been hacked into. Get over it, get the latest IIS hotfix, and get the site back<br>
up and running. The moms out there deserve a better secured website. DO IT NOW!<br><br>Sorry for the embarassment, but I really mis my mom. <br>
(If you think I'm corny, scroo yoo.)
<br><br>
Peace in the middle east,
<br><br>
st0rm1<br><br>
I need a little humor for people reading this so:<br><br>
<font color=yellow><b><u>hackercard:</u><br>
time it took to to find momsonline.com : <font color=red>1 second</font><br>
time it took to gain admin access on the winbox:<font color=red> 120 seconds</font><br>
time it took to write this html in notepad: <font color=red>420 seconds</font><br>
Being able to relieve ones grief over the loss of their mother by posting it for thousands to see:<font color=red> priceless</font>
