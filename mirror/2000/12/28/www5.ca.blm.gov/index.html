Looks like I'm 'a do everything myself <br>
Maybe I could use some help <br>
But hell, you want something done right <br>
You gotta do it yourself <br>
Maybe life is up and down <br>
But, my life's been what to now? <br>
I crawled up your butt from hell <br>
And that's when things got turned around <br>
<br><br>
It used to be a lie <br>
And now it feels pathetic <br>
And now I get it <br>
What's done is done <br>
You just leave it alone <br>
And don't regret it <br>
Sometimes some things turn into dumb things <br>
And that's when you put your foot down <br>
<br><br>
Why did I have to go and meet somebody like you? (like you) <br>
Why do you have to go and hurt somebody like me? (like me) <br>
How could you do somebody like that <br>
You know that I'm never coming back <br>
<br><br>

Got it? <br>
I crawled up your butt somehow <br>
Got it? <br>
And that's when shit got turned around <br>

Depending on you is done (is done) <br>
Giving to you is done <br>
No more eating, no sleeping, no living <br>
It's all just what giving to you and I'm done (and I'm done) <br>
<br><br>
But hiding from you is done (is done) <br>
But lying from you is done <br>
No more eating, no sleeping, no living <br>
It's all just what giving to you and I'm done (and I'm done) <br>

<br><br>
But why? <br>
Why? <br>
<br><br>

Ladies, gentlement <br>
What you are experiencing <br>
Is in fact an inner lie man <br>
I would like you to kick back <br>
And think about everything you've just heard <br>
