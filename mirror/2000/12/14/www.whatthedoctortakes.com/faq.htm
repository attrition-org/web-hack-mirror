<p><b><i>What is a vitamin?</i></b><br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2">A vitamin is a substance that the body needs to function properly. The word comes from a class of chemicals that are vital to life and are called amines.</font><br>
<br>
<i><b>How much do you need?</b></i><br>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">The initial concept of a vitamin was that a small amount is all that is needed. The minimum amount is the amount just necessary to prevent illness. This minimum is known as the RDA or recommended daily allowance.  The newer concept of vitamins is that by taking more than the minimum to prevent deficiency diseases, vitamins offer a protective function that may well protect us against other diseases. For example, higher doses of Vitamin E may protect us from heart disease and cataracts, and more folate may provide protection from heart disease, colon cancer, and birth defects. Some of these higher protective doses are hard to get from diet
alone</font>.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<i><b>What is a supplement?</b></i><br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2">If you ate a perfect diet you might not need extra vitamins, but few of us manage to do that. Moreover, if you want a protective diet, it is very difficult to get enough of all the foods and the amounts of them to get that protective dose. Supplements are additions to a diet that is as healthy as we can manage. It is not something to replace a healthy, well-rounded diet, but to add to it. Our diets should be well balanced and include plenty of vegetables, grains, and fiber and should be limited in fats, sweets, and excessive calories.&nbsp;</font><br>
<br>
<b><i>What is an antioxidant?&nbsp;</i></b><br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2">When a car gets older and gains mileage, it has wear and tear and it rusts. What happens when iron rusts is that it combines with oxygen; that is, it gets oxidized. While obviously quite a simplification, this can serve as an analogy to our bodies. Bad cholesterol, LDL, first gets oxidized before the whole downhill course of foam cells and cholesterol plaques lead to arteriosclerosis and heart attack. Our DNA also has some glitches in the coded program. To prevent rusting and wear and tear in cars we keep it oiled, lubricated, and painted. Paint, oil, and lubricants act as antioxidants. Antioxidants help prevent oxidation and damage created by free radicals that occur in nature, by pollutants, by disease, by the functioning of our cells, and by exercise.&nbsp;</font><br>
<br>
<b><i>Why gelcaps?</i></b><br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Our pills are loaded with plenty of great ingredients.  The amount of ingredients contributes to its large size.  We chose gelcap coating to help you swallow the pills.  The coating of gelcaps become more slippery when moistened by the saliva in our mouths and they just glide down.&nbsp;</font><br>
<br>
<b><i>Why twice a day?</i></b><br>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">To get everything you need in a reasonably sized pill would require you to take two gelcaps. Most of the ingredients could be effective by taking two gelcaps at one time. However, some of these vitamins, especially vitamin C, are best taken twice a day. Since Vitamin C is water-soluble, it leaves the body through the urine quickly. To maintain our vitamin's antioxidant effects both day and night, we recommend you take it twice a day.<br>
