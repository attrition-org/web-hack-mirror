<p><tt><b><font color="#FFFFFF">APOLLO11</font></b>: HOUSTON!! We might
have a problem...</tt>
<br><tt>69 defaced some poor NT server with zero, repeat, ZERO security...</tt>
<p><tt><b><font color="#FFFFFF">HOUSTON</font></b>: oh my gosh, that is
SO elite...</tt>
<br><tt>how did they do that... they must be SO skilled...</tt>
<br><tt>its very hard this days to find some unsecured NT box..</tt>
<br><tt>even harder is to find a website with exploits, download a .pl
or .c file</tt>
<br><tt>and the hardest thing: gcc and ./a.out</tt>
<br><tt>damnit this guys are so fuckin elite...</tt>
<p><tt>oh my gosh they also made a deface page, including greets to attrition,
packetstorm, and rain forest puppy...</tt>
<br><tt>fucking unbelievable, they know RFP?? he must be SO happy to have
so elite friends...</tt>
<p><tt>SHIT!!!! they have an email account on hushmail.com???</tt>
<br><tt>i cant fuckin believe it...</tt>
<br><tt>and check this out.. they are not malicious... they backed up the
index page...</tt>
<br><tt>they offer help for the administrator!?!?... how nice ...</tt>
<br><tt>real hackers with real ethics, fighting for their rights..</tt>
<br><tt>you know, this deface will help alot...will stop the comercialization,
will bring freedom of speech... it will even free kevin!!! (what? he is
already free? never mind then...)</tt>
<br><tt>BTW.. why did they release kevin from prison?? who are the hackers
supposed to "free" now??</tt>
<br><tt>we should inform the FBI, CIA, NSA, Interpol, LAPD even they should
be aware of the skills this guys have... perhaps they will hire them to
work for the gov...</tt>
<br><tt>yeah it will be a shame not to use their talent, their knowledge,
their mad skills...</tt>
<br><tt>APOLLO11, you have something on this guys??</tt>
<p><tt><b><font color="#FFFFFF">APOLLO11</font></b>: negative HOUSTON,
they work undercover, they erase logs, spoof IPs... we only have two nicknames...
its g0dSmack and luc|fer..they have defaced the server... we have nothing
about the rest of the gang</tt>
<p><tt><b><font color="#FFFFFF">HOUSTON</font></b>: roger that... we will
have to send our top agents mr.Smith and mr.Jackson... they will find them
for sure...</tt>
<p><tt><b><font color="#FFFFFF">APOLLO11</font></b>: HOUSTON, We just got
some info from DISCOVERY... they got some strange e-mail address that might
have something with 69... its <a href="mailto:c69@the-pentagon.com">c69@the-pentagon.com</a>
check it out...</tt>
<p><b><tt><font color="#FFFFFF">HOUSTON</font>:</tt></b><tt> roger that
APOLLO11, we contacted the FBI they are sending their men rightaway...</tt>
<p><tt><b><font color="#FFFFFF">APOLLO11</font></b>: got that HOUSTON...
requesting permition to land on Mars.. over</tt>
<p><tt><b><font color="#FFFFFF">HOUSTON</font></b>: afirmative APOLLO11,
you have permition, repeat, HAVE permition to land... gosh this is going
to be a small step for you and such a big step for the humanity...</tt>
<p><tt><b><font color="#FFFFFF">APOLLO11</font></b>: you can bet on that
HOUSTON... over</tt>

<p><tt>look mommy a hiden message from 69!!!</tt>
<p><tt><font size=-1>well.. because you discovered our secret message&nbsp;
(and nobody by now had the "scroll down" skills) you will be honored with
permition to read our stuff:</font></tt>
<p><tt><font size=-1>this is our first deface.. and honestly we are not
very proud for messing up with this IIS shit...</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>we did this because we are bored of all the defaces
made "with love for attrition"... attrition is great but it became a challenge
for the kids... they deface a page just to show their friends "how elite
they are", and find their names on attrition's mirror...</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>the whole thing with defacing became a stupid scheme
that almost everybody uses:</font></tt>
<p><tt><font size=-1>===============================</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>s0m3 31337 g4nG 0wNz y00!!</font></tt>
<p><tt><font size=-1>greetings to: attrition, safemode, HNN...</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>Fucks to: some other 31337 gang</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>Admin: nothing was deleted, need help? email 3133tgang@hushmail.com</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>old index backed up</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>===============================</font></tt>
<p><tt><font size=-1>and thats it... and the same deface page tomorow,
and tomorow and forever...</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>fuck thats BORING!!!</font></tt>
<p><tt><font size=-1>why dont they make something interesting, something
cool, something original...</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>something that "must be seen", something that will
REALY excuse their crime.. cause lets make it straight: in MOST of the
countries defacing IS a crime...</font></tt>
<p><tt><font size=-1>this is not ment for EVERYONE on the defacing scene...
there are a few exceptions..</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>a few people that deface with style, deface for a
reason, deface to say something to the world... and that something is not
"i am SO fucking elite! everybody else sux"...</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>we will not mention names... because someone (perhaps
everyone) will be angry...</font></tt>
<p><tt><font size=-1>thats all for now... see you when we see you...</font></tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt><font size=-1>at last but not least, our respects to:</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>makhack, b0g, rhino9, ADM, el8, rfp</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>and all who support our statement above...</font></tt></center>
