Aaahhh... root.<br> Such a sweet, yet forbidden fruit. Well, we got it from you, good.<br> Well, this site *has* been hacked. No, it wasn't very hard at all.<br> We aren't doing this to be l33t0 h4x0rz or anything like that, we just want<br> to get the message across. No computer is secure. <B>Anyone</B> can be hacked. <br> No matter how big your business or how technologically advanced your network, <br> sooner or later, you'll be hacked. This is what happened here.<br> Security is only as strong as it's weakest link, that's the hacker's job - <br> to find that link and exploit it to gain access to the rest of the system.<br> Normally you would have something to be afraid of, but not today. We come not to hurt your data, <br> but to explore. We have found your site insecure and have brought that fact to your attention. <br> In the future, you should think more about these things and maybe this won't happen again. <br> We are just informing you of this weak security before someone <br> with a malicious intent gets there first. <br> Now that this has been said, on to the greets and other stuff.</font></p>
