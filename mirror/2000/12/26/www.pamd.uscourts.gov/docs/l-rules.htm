the court may enter an appropriate order that such costs be taxed and require any party to pay

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (a) Civil complaints filed by prisoners seeking <EM>in forma pauperis</EM> status under 28 U.S.C.
§ 1915 are subject to the provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act ("PLRA"). In order to
promote the speedy, just and efficient administration of civil rights complaints subject to the
PLRA, the court has established forms to be used by prisoners for filing civil rights actions. 
The prisoner/plaintiff should complete and file the court-approved forms when initiating a civil
complaint.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (b) The court-approved forms consist of (1) a cover sheet, (2) a complaint, (3) an
application to proceed <EM>in forma pauperis</EM>, and (4) an authorization form. The authorization
form, when completed by the plaintiff, directs the agency holding the plaintiff in custody to
forward to the clerk of court a certified copy of the plaintiff's institutional trust fund account and
to disburse from the plaintiff's account the full statutory filing fee in amounts specified by 28
U.S.C. § 1915(b). Forms may be obtained from the clerk of court.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (c) Properly completing and filing the authorization form satisfies the plaintiff's obligation

the complaint.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><STRONG></STRONG></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><STRONG><A NAME="lr54.4"></A>LR 54.4</STRONG> <STRONG>Taxation of Costs.</STRONG></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> Costs shall be taxed in conformity with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §§ 1920 - 1923 and
such other provisions of law as may be applicable and such directives as the court may from
time to time issue. Taxable items include:</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> <STRONG>(1)</STRONG> <STRONG>Clerk's Fees and Service Fees</STRONG>. Clerk's fees (see 28 U.S.C. § 1920) and service
fees are allowable by statute. Fees required to remove a case from the state court to federal
court are allowed as follows: fees paid to clerk of state court; fees for services of process in
state court; costs of documents attached as exhibits to documents necessarily filed in state
court, and fees for witnesses attending depositions before removal.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> <STRONG>(2)</STRONG> <STRONG>Trial Transcripts</STRONG>. The cost of the originals of a trial transcript, a daily transcript and
of a transcript of matters prior or subsequent to trial, furnished to the court is taxable at the
rate authorized by the Judicial Conference when either requested by the court, or prepared
pursuant to stipulation. Mere acceptance by the court does not constitute a request. Copies
of transcripts for counsel's own use are not taxable in the absence of a special order of the
court.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> <STRONG>(3)</STRONG> <STRONG>Deposition Costs</STRONG>. The reporter's charge for the original deposition and/or a copy is
taxable whether or not the same is actually received into evidence, and whether or not it is
taken solely for discovery, regardless of which party took the deposition. Additional copies are
not taxable. The reasonable expenses of the deposition reporter, and the notary, or other
official presiding at the taking of the depositions are taxable, including travel and subsistence.
Expenses incurred in taking a deposition are not taxable. Fees for the witness at the taking
of a deposition are taxable at the same rate as for attendance at trial. The witness need not
be under subpoena. A reasonable fee for a necessary interpreter at the taking of a deposition
is taxable.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> <STRONG>(4)</STRONG> <STRONG>Witness Fees, Mileage and Subsistence</STRONG>. The rate for witness fees, mileage and
subsistence are fixed by statute (see 28 U.S.C. § 1821). Such fees are taxable even though
the witness does not take the stand provided the witness necessarily attends the court. Such
fees are taxable even though the witness attends voluntarily upon request and is not under
subpoena. The mileage taxation is that which is traveled based on the most direct route.
Mileage fees for travel outside the district shall not exceed 100 miles each way without prior
court approval. Witness fees and subsistence are taxable only for the reasonable period
during which the witness is within the district. No party shall receive witness fees for testifying
in his or her own behalf but this shall not apply where a party is subpoenaed to attend court
by the opposing party. Witness fees for officers of a corporation are taxable if the officers are
not defendants and recovery is not sought against the officers individually. Fees for expert
witnesses are not taxable in a greater amount than that statutorily allowable for ordinary
witnesses. Allowance of fees for a witness on deposition shall not depend on whether or not
the deposition is admitted into evidence.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> <STRONG>(5)</STRONG> <STRONG>Exemplification and Copies of Papers</STRONG>. The cost of an exhibit necessarily attached
to a document (or made part of a deposition transcript) required to be filed and served is
taxable. The cost of copies submitted in lieu of originals because of the convenience of
offering counsel or client are not taxable. The cost of reproducing copies of motions,
pleadings, notices and other routine case papers is not taxable. The cost of reproducing the
required number of copies of the clerk's record on appeal is allowable.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> <STRONG>(6)</STRONG> <STRONG>Maps, Charts, Models, Photographs, Summaries, Computations and Statistical
Summaries</STRONG>. The cost of maps and charts are taxable if they are admitted into evidence. The
cost of photographs 8" by 10" in size or less, are taxable if admitted into evidence, or attached
to documents required to be filed and served on opposing counsel. Enlargements greater then
8" by 10" are not taxable except by order of the court. The cost of models is not taxable except
by order of the court. The cost of compiling summaries, computations and statistical
comparisons is not taxable.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> <STRONG>(7)</STRONG> <STRONG>Interpreter Fees</STRONG>. The reasonable fee of a competent interpreter is taxable if the fee
of the witness involved is taxable. The reasonable fee of a competent translator is taxable if
the document translated is necessarily filed, or admitted in evidence.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> <STRONG>(8)</STRONG> <STRONG>Docket Fees</STRONG>. Docket fees and costs of briefs are taxable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §
1923. </FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> <STRONG>(9)</STRONG> Other items may be taxed with prior court approval.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> <STRONG>(10)</STRONG> The certificate of counsel required by 28 U.S.C. § 1924 and the local rules shall be
prima facie evidence of the facts recited therein. The burden is on the opposing party to

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> <STRONG>(a) Notice.</STRONG></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> The clerk of court shall notify the parties in all civil cases that they may consent to have
a magistrate judge conduct any or all proceedings in the case and order the entry of a final
judgment. Such notice shall be handed or mailed to the plaintiff or his or her representative
at the time an action is filed and to other parties as attachments to copies of the complaint and
summons, when served.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> <STRONG>(b) Execution of Consent.</STRONG></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> The clerk shall not accept a consent form unless it has been signed by all parties in a
case. The plaintiff shall be responsible for securing the execution of a consent form by the
parties and for filing such form with the clerk of court within sixty (60) days after the filing date
of the case. No consent form will be made available, nor will its contents be made known to
any judge or magistrate judge, unless all parties have consented to the reference to a
magistrate judge. No magistrate judge, judge, or other court official may attempt to persuade
or induce any party to consent to the reference of any matter to a magistrate judge. This rule,
however, shall not preclude a judge or magistrate judge from informing the parties that they
may have the option of referring a case to a magistrate judge.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> <STRONG>(c) Reference.</STRONG></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> After the consent form has been executed and filed, the clerk shall transmit it to the judge
to whom the case has been assigned for approval and referral of the case to a magistrate
judge. Once the case has been assigned to a magistrate judge, the magistrate judge shall
have the authority to conduct any and all proceedings to which the parties have consented and
to direct the clerk of court to enter a final judgment in the same manner as if a judge had
presided.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> <STRONG>(d) Cases Referred to a Magistrate Judge By Rotational Assignment.</STRONG></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><STRONG> </STRONG>A civil case may be referred to a magistrate judge at the time of the filing of the complaint
under the rotational assignment plan of the court and, at the same time, will be assigned to
a district court judge. The magistrate judge, independent of the parties' consent, is authorized
to exercise all the judicial authority that is provided for by law for a magistrate judge.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> The magistrate judge may, despite the initial absence of consent to proceed before the
magistrate judge, establish a deadline for a consent decision in the case management order. 
The parties shall be advised that they are free to withhold consent without adverse substantive
consequences.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> <STRONG>(e) Joint Case Management Plan.</STRONG></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> The parties in completing the joint case management plan form before the case
management conference, in all civil cases, shall state whether all parties consent to have a
magistrate judge conduct all proceedings including trial and the entry of a final judgment. 
Upon the consent of all of the parties, the assigned district court judge may direct the clerk to
reassign the case to a magistrate judge. In a case that has been referred to a magistrate
judge on a rotational basis, upon a statement in the joint case management plan that the
parties consent to proceed before the magistrate judge, the clerk shall reassign the case to
that magistrate judge.</FONT>

U.S.C. § 3402.</STRONG></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> An appeal from a judgment of conviction by a United States Magistrate Judge may be
taken to a judge of the district court in accordance with Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure. The appellant shall, within fifteen (15) days of the date of filing of the
appeal, serve and submit a brief. The United States Attorney shall serve and submit a brief
within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a copy of the appellant's brief. The appellant may serve
and submit a reply brief within five (5) days after receipt of the appellee's brief. The appeal
shall be considered and disposed of on the briefs without hearing or oral argument unless the
judge to whom the appeal is assigned specifically directs otherwise upon an application for
such hearing or argument by one or both of the parties. Any appellant who fails to comply with
this rule shall be deemed to have withdrawn the appeal. If the United States Attorney in any
such appeal fails to comply with this rule, it shall be deemed that the United States Attorney
does not oppose the appeal.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><STRONG><A NAME="lcr58.2"></A>LCrR 58.2</STRONG> <STRONG>Magistrate Judges, Authority for Forfeiture of Collateral.</STRONG></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> In accordance with Rule 58(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure this rule
authorizes payment of a fixed sum (forfeiture of collateral) in lieu of appearance as provided
in Standing Order #97-1, In Re: Forfeiture of Collateral Schedule, wherein the court's
periodically revised collateral forfeiture order is docketed. The clerk of court shall distribute
copies of the current order to all offices, agencies, and individuals involved in petty offense
cases and shall make copies available generally upon request. </FONT>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><STRONG><A NAME="lcr58.3"></A>LCrR 58.3 Magistrate Judges, General Provisions for Forfeiture of Collateral.</STRONG></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (a) The provisions of this rule do not create or otherwise define an offense. This rule
applies to petty offenses which have otherwise been created and/or defined by federal
statutes, regulations, or applicable state statutes lawfully assimilated by virtue of the
Assimilative Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. § 13) which petty offenses are committed within the
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (b) When an "X" is inserted next to a listed violation, the arresting officer may, in his
discretion, elect not to insert a forfeiture of collateral amount upon the violation notice and
therefore require the mandatory appearance of the defendant. A mandatory appearance
should be required where the offense is deemed by the arresting officer to be of a serious or
aggravated nature. Where a particular violation is not designated by an "X" on the collateral
forfeiture schedule, no mandatory appearance shall be required except as provided for in LCrR
58.3(k). </FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (c) When a particular violation is not listed on the most current collateral forfeiture
schedule as described in LCrR 58.2, it shall be treated as one requiring the mandatory
appearance of the defendant. In these cases, forfeiture of collateral will not be permitted, and
the defendant's appearance will be required. Mandatory offenses will be referred directly to
the designated magistrate judge.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (d) At no time may collateral be set in an amount greater than the maximum fine
authorized for the offense charged, nor may collateral be less than any mandatory minimum
fine which may be required as a penalty for the offense charged. Should any collateral
erroneously be set higher than the authorized maximum fine, then the collateral shall
automatically be reduced to said authorized maximum fine. Should any collateral erroneously
be set in an amount less than a required mandatory minimum fine, the amount of collateral
shall automatically be increased to said mandatory minimum.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (e) A collateral offense shall be processed by giving an alleged offender a violation notice
or citation, with mail-in envelope, setting forth the offense, the date and location thereof, name
of the issuing officer, the full name, address, and any other identifying data concerning the
offender and the amount of collateral which can be forfeited. It shall further contain instructions
to pay the collateral to the clerk of court or, if the offender wishes to contest the charge, to
indicate the option to appear before the United States Magistrate Judge for trial or other
appropriate proceedings. The original and one (1) copy of such violation notices will be
promptly forwarded to the clerk's office by the issuing agency.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (f) The clerk shall establish a procedure for the processing of violation notices, citations,
and collateral within the clerk's office. This procedure will include one follow-up to the
offender, if collateral is not received within twenty (20) days. If not then paid, the violation will
be referred to a magistrate judge for processing in accordance with paragraph (j). All violation
notices and citations issued to alleged offenders shall show the clerk's address for the receipt
of collateral or notice that a defendant desires a hearing before the United States Magistrate
Judge.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (g) For any petty offense in which collateral is not set, the defendant shall be issued a
violation notice or citation containing the information required in paragraph (e) above, except
that in the space provided for the amount of collateral there shall be inserted the letters "M.A.",
which letters shall indicate mandatory appearance required, directing the defendant to appear
before a United States Magistrate Judge at a specified date and time or otherwise indicating
that the defendant will be notified when to appear in the future.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (h) If collateral is posted for any offense in which collateral is set as authorized by this rule,
the collateral shall be forfeited to the United States, and forfeiture of said collateral shall signify
that the defendant does not contest the charge nor request a hearing before a United States
Magistrate Judge. Such action shall be tantamount to a finding of guilty, and the defendant
shall be deemed convicted of any offense for which collateral is paid and forfeited.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (I) Whenever a check is returned to the clerk as uncollectible for any reason within the
control of the payor, the clerk will make only one follow-up to obtain payment. After twenty (20)
days and no payment, the offense for which the collateral was posted shall be referred
promptly to the appropriate United States Magistrate Judge for the scheduling of a mandatory
appearance or such other action as may be deemed appropriate by the United States
Magistrate Judge.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (j) Failure to respond or appear.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (1) When an alleged violator fails to pay any collateral set pursuant to this rule, fails to
notify the clerk of his or her desire to stand trial within thirty (30) days from the date the
violation notice or citation is issued, fails to respond to a notice to appear, fails to answer
a summons to appear, or fails to appear when otherwise ordered by the United States
Magistrate Judge, the United States Magistrate Judge may consider and treat the
offense as a mandatory appearance offense, and thereafter refuse any tender of the
payment of collateral and set the case for hearing, in which event the collateral shall
automatically double from the amount originally set on the violation notice or order.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (2) A United States Magistrate Judge may also issue a warrant for the arrest of the
alleged offender as authorized by Rule 4(c) of the Rules of Procedure for the Trial of
Misdemeanors before United States Magistrate Judges. Should it be necessary for the
court or United States Magistrate Judge to issue an arrest warrant as a result of an
alleged violator's failure to appear, the amount of collateral shall automatically triple from
the amount originally set on the violation notice or citation. For good cause shown, the
court and/or the United States Magistrate Judge may reduce the collateral.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> (k) Nothing contained herein shall prevent the United States Magistrate Judge from
requiring a mandatory appearance or from issuing a notice to appear, summons or warrant of
arrest in accordance with Rule 58(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or from
refusing any tender of collateral when a hearing is scheduled, or from imposing the maximum
penalty authorized by statute or regulation for the offense charged upon a plea of nolo
contendere or guilty or upon a verdict of guilty.</FONT>

</FONT>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><STRONG> As a member of the Bar of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, I
will strive for the following professional ideal:</STRONG></FONT>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times">1. The rule of law will govern my entire conduct. I will not violate the law or place myself above the law.</FONT>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times">2. I will treat with civility and respect the lawyers, clients, opposing parties, the court and all the officials
with whom I work. Professional courtesy is compatible with vigorous advocacy and zealous
representation. Even though antagonism may be expected by my client, it is not part of my duty to my
client.</FONT>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times">3. I will respect other lawyers' schedules as my own, and will seek agreement on meetings, depositions,
hearings, and trial dates. A reasonable request for a scheduling accommodation should never be
unreasonably refused.</FONT>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times">4. Communications are life lines. I will keep the lines open. Telephone calls and correspondence are a
two-way channel; I will respond to them promptly.</FONT>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times">5. I will be punctual in appointments, communications and in honoring scheduled appearances. Neglect
and tardiness are demeaning to others and to the judicial system.</FONT>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times">6. I will earnestly attempt to resolve differences through negotiation, expeditiously and without needless
expense.</FONT>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times">7. Procedural rules are necessary to judicial order and decorum. I will be mindful that pleadings,
discovery processes and motions cost time and money. I will not use them heedlessly. If an adversary
is entitled to something, I will provide it without unnecessary formalities.</FONT>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times">8. I will not engage in conduct that brings disorder or disruption to the courtroom. I will advise my client
and witnesses appearing in court of the proper conduct expected and required there and, to the best of
my ability, prevent my client and witnesses from creating disorder or disruption.</FONT>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times">9. Before dates for hearings or trials are set, or if that is not feasible immediately after such date has been
set, I will attempt to verify the availability of necessary participants and witnesses so I can promptly
notify the court of any likely problems.</FONT>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
