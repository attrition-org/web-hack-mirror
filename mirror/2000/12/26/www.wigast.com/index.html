"                                  <strong>HANG THE CHRISTMAST EVE'S NITE BOMBER!!!</strong>"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>On the nite before the Cristmast Eve, some church in Jakarta, Bekasi, Sukabumi, Riau and some other place in Indonesia blowed up by bombs. Pengendali Ketegangan Sosial (a group of volunteers) data said that 3 dead, 21 wounded and 7 others are going home after got several medichine. This tragedy countinued by some blurry news that there're several bomb threat in any other place such as hospital to shopping malls.</strong></p>"
"<p><strong>No one arrested til now, so the motives behind this bombing actions remain unsolved. Is this a religion conflict provocation, as happened in Maluku? Or is there any political motives like usual? No one can answer it now. Everyone is just guessing and suspecting others that make everything more confusing.</strong></p>"
"<p><strong>Some people's organization demand the government to take this case really seriously. Even Mega promised to take care of this case. Polri (Indonesian national police force) and TNI (Indonesian national army) do the same thing, and of course this continued by lot of political parties</strong></p>"
"<p><strong>Different with bombing actions from several radical organizations in other countries, such as England's famous organization Angry Brigade on their glorious days in '60s, this curch bombing seems to leaned to provocate religious conflict and ignored to see who's the victims. In Angry Brigade's cases, they just destroyed properties and never attacked life, and beyond all of that actions, they did it for people's liberty. And also different with what peoples did at the time when Indonesian were fight back against Netherland imperialism at last centuries, the Christmast Eve's bombing is really sucks!</strong></p>"
"<p><strong>The most important point beyond all of that thing, is not just keep hoping that the government or another will solve this case, but the key is on ourselves. We can increasing our communal security, increasing our tolerant among other's ethnic and religion and faith or nationality, so its not easy to provoke us even with any issues or actions.</strong></p>"
"<p><strong>Its all not about politics, religious differences or terrorism act. But the key beyond all of it, is about how to live in togetherness. Its all about how we take care others, its all about you and me.</strong></p>"
"<p><strong>And until all of that harmony and togetherness, we should take our own action to stop all this shit just like Christmas Eve's bombing. Never let it happen again, nobody knows who's the next victim!!!</strong></p>"
