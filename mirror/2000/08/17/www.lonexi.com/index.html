<title>:(</title>
<center>i tried to deface this site and giving some meaning to it but i dont know any :(<br>
<p>Hi admin! I am <a href="mailto:uberl33t@usa.net">pr|est</a> of <a href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~uberl33th4x0rs">the poltergeists</a><br>And instead of cybering around... I h4x0red your website :/<br></p>
<p>now you might think OMG OMG I G0T H4X0R3D BY SOME 3V1L H4X0R.. now thats NOT true..<br>
im not evil!@%!$^#^@#$% ... I patched the hole i used to come in with... yey..<br><br>
Its a big shame i regulary find unsecured boxes.. They should not exist.. Cos after all, you got<br>
nice h4x0rs like me.... and evil h4x0rs who abuse your box for all goals avaiable [ie. smurfing/icmping]<br>
Those h4x0rs give a bad name to the other h4x0rs :( .. ie.. the goodwilling ones.. They should be<br>
eliminated to put it in a hard way heh... Well, if yew want an example of an 3v1l h4x0r, go to <a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/2000/08/15/www.ez-marketing.com/">this link</a>..<br>
I was wondering where this kid got his mind from.. thats not very h4x0ry :(<br>
there are also good h4x0rs.. like the guys from g-force pakistani and m0s.. [hi !].. they h4x0r<br>
websites and give a meaning to it... Their meaning in this case is a protest against different<br>
things going on in the world...<br><br>
anyways.. i'm nuttering too much.. all i wanted to say is<br>
<br>
