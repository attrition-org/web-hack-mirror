ADMIN: sorry i defaced your pretty .mil box, im just trying to get a point across about this carnivore shit.  it is not right.  it's sad that your box has 450+ users on it and yet it has such shitty security. :(

<p>The FBI has created an email sniffing system called carnivore.

Carnivore permits access to the e-mail of every customer of an

ISP and the e-mail of every person who communicates with them,

this includes web based e-mail systems also, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc.

They have gone too far with technological invasions of

communications systems. This is a plain case of Internet spying.

The FBI insisted that the Carnivore system is an important weapon

in the war against Internet and other forms of crime but members

of Congress expressed fears that it could be used to invade the

privacy of innocent Internet users. That's right, those e-mails

to grandma can be monitored. Were losing our privacy more and

more, we must take a stand before we loose all of our privacy.

Constitutional rights don't end where cyberspace begins. We need

preserve our Fourth Amendment rights. We're basically left with

the FBI attaching a listening advice to an Internet Service

Provider, and simply having their assurances that they'll look at

only those things that a court tells them they can look at. They

are able to look at everything that's going through that Internet

Service Provider, and we don't know what they're looking at, and

what they're not, we have no way of monitoring it.</p>
