<p><font SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Overview</font>

<p>You can use the expression evaluator as a testing
,as well as learning tool when using complex expressions in Cold Fusion 2.0.
You can use the evaluator to compose complex expressions and test
their evaluation. The evaluator also enables you to open, save and mail expression
statements tested in the evaluator.

<p><font SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Using the Evaluator</font>

<p>Use the evaluator form to enter expressions you would like to evaluate.
The evaluator processes the expressions you enter line-by-line providing
you with the possibility to evaluate multiple expressions. In addition you
can assign the results of your expressions to variables which can then be used
in subsequent expressions. Here is an example. Click the EVALUATE button to 
test the expressions. When done, click the BACK button to get back to HELP.

<form NAME="Form1" ACTION="eval.cfm?RequestTimeout=2000" METHOD="POST">
<textarea NAME="Expressions" ROWS="7" COLS="55">
// Enter your expressions here, one per line
// This is a comment

x = 34 + 23
y = 78 + RANDOMIZE(1)
x+y
</textarea><br>
<input TYPE="Submit" VALUE="Evaluate">
</form>

<p>You have noticed the ways the evaluator outputs the results of the expressions
entered. It lists the expression along with its line number followed by
the output of the appropriate result.

<p>Assignment of expressions to variables can be very powerful as you can simulate 
variable manipulations as they are occurring in your Cold Fusion applications. However,
you need to remember to use the <b>VariableName=Expression</b> syntax as you CANNOT use 
CFML tags within the evaluator. The following example demonstrates the use of the
evaluator to test the behavior of some of the date functions:

<form NAME="Form2" ACTION="eval.cfm?RequestTimeout=2000" METHOD="POST">
<textarea NAME="Expressions" ROWS="7" COLS="55">
// Simple date sentence.
&quot;Today's Date is &quot; &amp; DateFormat(Now(),&quot;dd-mmm-yy&quot;)   

// Simple day-of-year sentence.              
DayOfYear(Now()) &amp; &quot; days have passed this year.&quot;

</textarea><br>
<input TYPE="Submit" VALUE="Evaluate">
</form>

<p><font SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Using Comments</font>

<p>You must have already noticed that comments can be used in between the 
expression statements providing you with a way of documenting your 
testing. Simple use <b>//</b> to delineate each line of comments.

<p><font SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Resolving Errors</font>

<p>The evaluator is a simple application written in Cold Fusion. 
When encountering an invalid expression the evaluator throws a regular 
Cold Fusion error message pointing at the line of code inside the evaluator
which attempted to evaluate your expression. Ignore the evaluator code
printed at the top of the error message. Scroll down to the bottom of the 
error message where is usually displayed the expression which 
causes the error. 

<p><font SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Opening, Saving and Mailing Expressions</font>

<p>For your convenience the evaluator enables you to open simple text 
files into the expression window, as well as, to save expressions into
text files. Use this functionality if you prefer to keep a reference 
of the expressions tested with the evaluator. You can also e-mail your
expressions directly from the evaluator for added convenience. This may be a 
useful feature when forwarding expression samples to your colleagues or forwarding
problems to Allaire Technical Services .

<p><font SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">REMEMBER - No use of CFML tags is allowed inside the evaluator.</font>
