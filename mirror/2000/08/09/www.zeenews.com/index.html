<a href="mirror.html">Mirror</a>

This mirror is difficult to display because of the crappy .asp and .js used
in the page. Because of the crappy Microsoft editors used for the creation of
the pages, the lines are too long and annoying to manage. You can also view
the page in <a href="mirror.txt">.txt format</a> to read the text left by the defacer.
