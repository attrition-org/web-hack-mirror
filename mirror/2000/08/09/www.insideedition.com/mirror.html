Filing a law suit against Napster has probably made you lose your image, fans, and sales.
All because you either wanted more money(not like you had enough to begin with, right!?) or
because you wanted publicity. Well you got your publicity. If you haven't realized you have also
caused a chain reaction of other problems. Software developers looking for the same fame Napster
got(which probably wasn't intended) -- but now everyone is devising plans to make themselves
popular like Napster did, if they shut down. In turn making your so called "problems" even worse.
If you wanted it this way, you got it.<br><br>

P.S. To tell you the truth, I really wasn't a Napster user and I'm still not. So before you go on a 
spree to defend yourselves with "napster users are hackers! shut 'em down!" -- think again. I'm speaking out. 
I just saw something wrong, and I'm doing what I can to help right it.

Music is art, an extension of ourselves.  Major label record companies do not sell art, they sell 50 cents of plastic at $15 because they see music as an industry.  Less than 1% of your $15 will end up going to the artist.  The artists (metallica, dre) complaining about napster obviously care a great deal about the money involved with their art, rather than the art itself.  Perhaps because they are also producers, in the business of selling 50 cents of plastic at $15?  Maybe.

The RIAA is a joke. the RIAA does not represent your favorite music artists.  They represent rich record executives. These are the people who make profit from the other 99% of cd sales. These people are so filthy rich, the only thing they know how to do is squabble over how rich they are and how they dont want anything to happen to their wealth.  There's more to life than money fellas.

"This I say to you, what I say is true, emotions aren't a product to sell and cannot be consumed."
