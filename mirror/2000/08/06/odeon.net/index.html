<H4><CENTER>Thaz right bishes, hackweiser is here with a new hax0r
for jew!</CENTER></H4>

<H4><CENTER>No we don't bring the &quot;flav a flav&quot; and
we certainly dont bring wuftpd2600.c juarez, but we sure do bring
alot of beer!</CENTER></H4>

<H4><CENTER>odeon.net admin, we backed up your index and shiznit.
Just hope you don't get owned again heh.</CENTER></H4>

<H4><CENTER>Welp, as you might have heard my good friend p4ntera
has been &quot;kicked&quot; out of ph33r the b33r. Why you ask?
Well from what he tells me, its because the members of ph33r the
b33r were a little scared after his defacement on southernbellebras.
They believe that the feds will get &quot;pissed off&quot; and
go and raid everyone. That clearly shows a lack of common
sense.</CENTER></H4>

<H4><CENTER>The feds could give a shit about a fucking bra site.
</CENTER></H4>

<H4><CENTER>Ahh well, his message stands with us now, because of
the support he got from the last defacement.</CENTER></H4>

<H4><CENTER>Now for the following shouts: S1D3K1CK SL4PPY, HFD,
gH/mosthated, Devil-C, RSH, #blacksun and of course my negro sk00lk
=D, fut0n the cheap mexican whore =) and anyone in ph33r the b33r
who is cool.</CENTER></H4>

<H4><CENTER>Fucks: Mostly to ph33r the b33r, the members who think
that kicking p4ntera out will give them sanctuary. And especially
GaYaSSSS, because he is a lame packet kiddie who lies about anything
and everything. Um and GForce, do something other then putting the same
fucking shit on all your web defacements.</CENTER></H4>
