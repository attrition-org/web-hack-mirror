        <p align="left"><font size="2">Well, if you look at Jammu (held) Kashmir 
          closely today, it is inevitable to notice the changes that have taken 
          place, or should we say, forced by the Indian Government. It is obvious 
          that no Kashmiri is happy with the way things are being handled by the 
          Indian Militants, and who would be? Especially when your family/your 
          humble neighbours/your relatives get either brutally murdered or relentlessly 
          sodomized by the so called &quot;Veer Jawans&quot; of India. The following 
          is an extract from a Kashmiri newspaper and it requires YOUR attention!</font></p>

        <p align="left"> <font size="2">The killing of at least 90 people in Kashmir 
          on Tuesday night was a horrible crime and India should allow international 
          humanitarian organisations and foreign journalists to determine responsibility, 
          foreign minister Abdul Sattar said in an interview with Reuters Television 
          here on Thursday. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">Sattar repeated Pakistan’s assertion it 
          had no role in the ceasefire announced on July 24 by Hizbul Mujahideen 
          but said Islamabad would like to see a comprehensive ceasefire involving 
          all militant groups. "Not only Pakistan but India itself can exercise 
          influence to change the direction in Kashmir away from violence to a 
          political and peaceful approach," he said. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">He said that the United States should also 
          ask India to allow an investigation into the massacres. A US national 
          security council spokesman said on Wednesday the United States was talking 
          to the Pakistanis to encourage them to use their influence to help bring 
          the violence in Kashmir to an end. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">Asked if Clinton had also talked to chief 
          executive General Pervez Musharraf, Sattar said no such call had been 
          received as of Thursday morning. But he said if such an approach was 
          made, we will say what I have already said (about the matter). </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">"We would like the United States to ask 
          India to permit impartial investigations. Otherwise the Indian desire 
          to blame Pakistan conceals a deeper desire to divert attention...from 
          savage repression in Kashmir," he said. "We would welcome an impartial, 
          neutral, third-party mechanism." He said the Indian government allowed 
          only very restricted access to foreign journalists in Kashmir. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">The foreign office dismissed Indian allegations 
          of derailing the peace process and said New Delhi’s accusations were 
          to malign Islamabad and Kashmiri freedom fighters. "Indian must end 
          all violence against the Kashmiri people and Kashmir freedom movement 
          and reduce its forces present in Indian Kashmir which is necessary for 
          progress towards a just settlement of this long- standing issue," the 
          Foreign Office spokesman added. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">He said Indian allegations were intended 
          to malign Pakistan and Kashmir freedom movement and Pakistan rejects 
          such allegations. When asked about the dialogue offer of Hizbul Mujahideen 
          to New Delhi, the spokesman said Pakistan had already stated that this 
          was part of the dynamics of the freedom struggle in Kashmir. "It is 
          the leaders of the freedom movement who are the best judge to carry 
          the struggle for the realisation of their right to self-determination 
          as has been demanded by the UN Security Council and recognised by India," 
          he added. Reaffirming Islamabad’s position, he said Pakistan had already 
          condemned the killing of civilians in attacks in Kashmir. Chief Executive 
          General Pervez Musharraf has also condemned violence against the civilians.

        <p align="left"><font size="2">When we speak of the Kashmiris, we speak 
          for not only the vast majority of Muslims living there, but also the 
          Sikhs and other people that undergo such maltreatment by the Indians 
          (You are Kashmiris, not Indians!). </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">The Indian public has been misguided and 
          are unaware of such atrocious feats committed by their own &quot;Veer 
          Jawans&quot; or those whom they call &quot;Vijay Jyotis&quot;. Quite 
          frankly, this has to stop and that's what this is all about. No one 
          wants to damage or cause harm to anyone else unless they really mean 
          it, and if you (Indian system admin) were unaware of the above and strongly 
          believe that what has been done in Kashmir by the Indian Government 
          is wrong, selfish and undesireable, you're on our side, (cheers!). Admin, 
          thanks for supporting our cause. </font></p>
