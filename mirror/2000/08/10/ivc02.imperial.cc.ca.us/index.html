"'War on material!' should be our slogan in future wars...The principle of
destroying property rather than people is based on various
arguments: first of all, the self-interest of the ruling classes, who are
inlove with property more than anything else. They will readily let down
any form of government and even more readily betray their country if their
property is at stake. They will also surrender without ceremony or
conditions the moment their property is destroyed.A logical and
universally valid lesson may be drawn from this argument as far as class
warfare is concerned. Any threat to property lowers its inflated value
correspondingly. To ruin confidence in capital in all its forms should be
the constant aim of class warfare..."- Gustave-Paul Cluseret

"We are so perverted by an education which from infancy seeks to kill in
us the spirit of revolt, and to develop that of submission to
authority; we are so perverted by this existence under the ferrule of a
law, which regulates every event in life--our birth, our education, our
development, our love, our friendship--that, if this state of things
continues, we shall lose all initiative, all habit of thinking for
ourselves."- Peter Kropotkin

 "The only demand that property recognizes is its own gluttonous appetite
for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power to subdue, to
crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade."- Emma
Goldman
