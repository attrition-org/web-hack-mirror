    Railings was created to fulfill a need within the construction industry for a cost
    efficient alternative to custom ironwork. </font></strong><p><strong><font color="#000000">Many
    homeowners, with a photo in hand, were frustrated when they were constantly informed by
    their builders or designers that the ironwork they wanted far exceeded their budget. These
    same homeowners were forced to settle for iron castings, simple iron verticals or even
    wooden spindles and they weren't pleased with the choices they had. </font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="#000000">With this in mind, Regency Railings began the painstaking
    task of creating a hand forged iron product that could be prefabricated in separate
    elements, shipped direct to the job site on flat pallets, and when assembled created the
    custom iron look desired by these homeowners.</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="#000000">Since there was no blueprint for such a product, many
    obstacles needed to be overcome to produce a hand forged product that would fit virtually
    any staircase or straight railing. Understanding that no two applications are the same,
    the elements had to be designed in a manner to accommodate the varying degrees of
    inclination and the varying radius of a curved staircase and still be able to pass the
    4&quot; sphere code. After years of development, and several modifications, Regency
    Railings' <i>TUSCANY </i>design was completed.</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="#000000">Regency Railings has continued to expand the design
    choices and our products have been installed from coast to coast and in two foreign
    countries.&nbsp; All of our drawings etc. are protected by U.S Patent No. 5,820,000 and
    other pending patents.</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="#000000">Regency Railings is in the process of establishing a
    national distribution network and a stocking distributor should be located in your area
    soon. We will, however, continue to ship to areas without stocking distribution direct
    from our factory warehouse in Addison, Texas. </font></strong></p>
