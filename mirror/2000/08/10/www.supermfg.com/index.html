&lt;p>Look, new layout.. like it?&lt;br><br>
&lt;br><br>
cracked by RAT (i wanna be famous some day)
<br>
dude, you are lucky today. Your site is cracked. Now you can fix it, before a real hacker hacks it and tries to install UNIX on your windowsNT.&lt;br><br>
&lt;br><br>
I hate hackers. they make to much rules, they think they know everything, call everybody script kiddy's, and they say things they all copied from others. and they lie all the time.&lt;br><br>
&lt;br><br>
You wanna know why I did this? Not to make the internet more secure. I don't care about your server's being safe.. I'm hacking for fun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br><br>
&lt;br><br>
Of course nothing is destroyed... except maybe the pride of the admin dude. old index=index.old &amp;nbsp;&lt;br><br>
&lt;br><br>
I'm a lonely guy, so if you want to mail me, mail me at rat111@mail.com&lt;br><br>
&lt;br><br>
I'm not saying you are stupid admin, you probably don't care about the website, and only like the money you get. But that just doesn't work all the time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br><br>
&lt;br><br>
Oh.. shit, I forgot to say some cool things...&amp;nbsp;&lt;br><br>
