<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>p4ntera:</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>I told you everything was cool
between us and I was just a little upset about what you did.&nbsp; You
had no reason to do that other than to act like a big shot.&nbsp; Friendwise,
I was cool with you.&nbsp; Friends can be upset at each other once in a
while and still be friends.&nbsp; But you stepped way out of line when
you defaced this site so I am showing you I can do the same.&nbsp; You
are not a hacker and I am.&nbsp; I think it was Spiderman that said "with
great power comes great responsibility."&nbsp; You know your shit, but
you abuse it.&nbsp; Just because you can deface a site doesn't mean you
should.&nbsp; I have reason and meaning with my hacks.&nbsp; You just do
it because you think it makes you look cool.&nbsp; Hell, if you like AOLamers
admiring you then fine keep it up.&nbsp; The people that really count will
always know exactly what you are.&nbsp; Oh, I talked to your lawyer the
other day.&nbsp; He traced (/whois on IRC) my IP back to 127.0.0.1.&nbsp;
He claims he's going to send that to the FBI.&nbsp; You better be the one
watching your back, because if you get busted I doubt his uberleet intelligence
is gonna help you out a whole lot.&nbsp; I'm not saying this to your face
because you got k-lined for flooding w/ mIRC scripts and I didn't know
what server you were on.&nbsp; And the rest of your crew (Zapco) wouldn't
give me the key to #hackweiser to talk to them.&nbsp; BTW:&nbsp; Why are
you having them go into #ph33r-the-b33r and ask us to join Hackweiser?&nbsp;
Didn't you leave us and make your own crew to get away from us?&nbsp; Oh
that's right.&nbsp; You got kicked out for knarking on us and telling the
FBI to come arrest us.&nbsp; What a great leader.&nbsp; It's okay, most
of us never listened to you anyways.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I'm going to regret
these next few lines but here goes.&nbsp; Dude I respect your knowledge,
just not your judgement.&nbsp; I believe that what you did to me was because
of your hatred for the situation as a whole.&nbsp; I still want to be your
friend.&nbsp; I just want you to be cool again like when I first met you.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>To those people from irc.msn.com
that wont grow up (you know who you are):</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>Stop sending me messages on my
mICQ with your IP addresses and asking me to try and nuke you.&nbsp; Stop
telling me that a mIRC script I made a year ago doesn't work and is gay.&nbsp;
Stop coming to my IRC server and smurfing my proxies.&nbsp; Stop /msging
me when my channel is +k and calling me paragay.&nbsp; You're not real
intelligent and your childish acts show it.&nbsp; Just because you go to
EFNet sometimes does not mean you're a hacker.&nbsp; Stop sending me URLs
of XOOM pages that say "hacked by nerdboy, rudeboy, sephiroth, chill, and
all those other people from #darkblade - you suck paragon."&nbsp; We all
know that you just signed up for an account and wrote that shit on it.&nbsp;
As for saying I always lie, I didn't lie when I said I'd take you all on
at DefCon.&nbsp; Too bad none of you showed up.</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>I've noticed a few of you actually
installed Linux on your machine.&nbsp; Just to let you know, Mandrake and
RedHat have lots of holes in them and you're better off on Windows 9x until
you learn how to patch shit.&nbsp; Oh and stop telling your friend's I'm
an asshole for rooting your boxes.&nbsp; I just did shutdown -h now Stop
Bothering Me!.&nbsp; I was tired of you asking me how to do stuff.&nbsp;
Leave the girls that I hang out with on IRC alone too.&nbsp; Most of them
do not know much about computers and you ICMPing them to death doesn't
show much skill.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>Man oh man am I tired of all this
shit.&nbsp; Why can't we just chill on IRC and talk about computers and
maybe learn something from each other?&nbsp; Why must you all launch denial
of service attacks against each other?&nbsp; If I didn't have better things
to do besides play games with you people online I'd go insane.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>pr0pz this time are short.&nbsp;
I'm super tired.&nbsp; I'm going to go back to America and visit some girls
I met on IRC.&nbsp; Maybe when I get back all of you will be a little more
mature.&nbsp; pr0pz to: [JcMd], emmy, w4x, ph33r-the-b33r, and all those
other people I normally shout to.</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>Special pr0pz to Admin_Bill`` of
irc.msn.com for k-lining me.&nbsp; I never realized how full of losers
that IRC server was until I was not allowed back on it.&nbsp; You still
didn't have to kline me just because I found that sploit to let me have
+q in any +r channel.&nbsp; You could have just asked me nicely not to
use it and I would have.&nbsp; Ah hell this is a super long page so why
not keep going with what I have on my mind?</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>The Napster controversy.&nbsp; The
RIAA is being given free advertisement in my opinion.&nbsp; Before I started
using Napster I didn't buy more than one CD a month.&nbsp; I was content
with the radio.&nbsp; After using Naspter for almost 6 months now I have
purchased about 75 CDs.&nbsp; I like a lot of stuff I never knew was out.&nbsp;
My friends have told me similar things after I installed Napster on their
machines.&nbsp; They should not be suing anyone.&nbsp; They would be doing
lots of damage to themselves by closing Napster.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>Oh yeah.&nbsp; I should mention
how I got in here.&nbsp; The same way p4ntera did.&nbsp; I just exploited
some CGI.&nbsp; Took 20 minutes.&nbsp; I did not erase anything.&nbsp;
I even backed up p4ntera's HTML in case the admin wanted to see it.&nbsp;
I'm really sorry, but I take shit from no one.&nbsp; I'll click on your
advertisments or buy something off your site or do something else to get
you money when you get your site back up.&nbsp; =P</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>Ah hell it's noon.&nbsp; I'm gonna
go eat.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>It's not redefacing.&nbsp; It's
avenging.&nbsp; Can you say avenge?&nbsp; Let us help you: ah-ven-ja</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>- parag0n -</font></font></center>
