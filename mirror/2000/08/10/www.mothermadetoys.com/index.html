<center>hacked by prizm of b0f security.</center>
<br>
<center>I hacked this server to say that attrition.org are a bunch of
hypocrit faggots for hosting their defacement archieve, yet they dont
condone defacements. </center>
<br>
<center> They say that script kiddies are stupid for running around  
defacing all these random servers, yet, they host a defacement archive   
that 90% of media organizations visit to keep tabs on hacks. What it seems
like to me is that the attrition crew are nothing but a bunch of lame
media whores that want to get their 15 minutes of fame in this huge media 
surge from the media about hackers and hacking.</center>
<br>
<center>Also, doesn't it seem kinda odd that some of the attrition crew
are "security consultants" and host a defacement mirror?  What a better  
way to cash in huh?  Host a defacement mirror, send e-mails out to the
hacked machines and offer your services.  They say they dont, but they
also said they werent HFG, but everyone knows they were. They ever missed
a HFG hack did they? Nope.

<br>
<center>Attrition.org is nothing more than antionline.com with a
defacement mirror. It's all about the media.  All those RDS kiddies
running around rds'ing their way into any and everything they can find and
hosting their hacks are a great way to get that media to come isn't
it?  A great way to get work.

I'm gonna send this to attrition.org to see if they will
mirror something that talks shit about them.  The problably will edit this
defacement like they do most of the others.  I guess we'll see.
