kind of ironic dont you think? lots of loss prevention... lol, anyways i just wanted to say a couple things. like what the fuck is up
with the doc droppin thing, seems like its been happening more often lately for some reason. i for one dont 
why this sort of behavior isnt more hated by the community. in my mind theres no such reason for it except 
for maybe a few extreme circumstances. but either way, theres no reason to fuck up someones life like that 
for some stupid petty revenge or whatever. there is absolutely no fucking need to make our families suffer
because their kid slipped up somewhere wanting to be a haxor kiddie. if they're that lame they'll get what
they got coming sooner or later anyway. and i mean geez, ya think they're gonna forget that? better hope your
handle doesnt slip at a conference or something and you end up in someones trunk. because we all know damn 
well theres a difference between what goes on here, and whats happens when we're not in front of that box
your all staring at right now... i mean there should be <i>some</i> morals here. sheit... then say you quit
this scene for whatever reason and someone decides to be a smartass and call <b>your</b> telling them your 
hobby of a past life, its fucking pathetic and deserving of a severe ass beating... too many scheming little
bastards out there, i say those numbers need to lessen and people should start spittin some love... ok moving on,
<a href="http://www.williamcooper.com">www.williamcooper.com</a> go there... oh and admin, nothing was harmed. anyway that about does it for me
i'm out-tie... utinam logica falsa tuam philosophiam totam suffodiant...
