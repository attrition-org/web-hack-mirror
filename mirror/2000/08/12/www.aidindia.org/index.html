        <P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>As much as We would like to talk 
          about Pakistan's right to having Kashmir as it's province We won't. 
          We are beyond that now. We don't really care who gets Kashmir; All we 
          want is to stop the violence in Kashmir. Innocent people are killed 
          daily by Indian soldiers simply because of what these people they believe 
          in. The Kashmir's support Pakistan despite the option of independence, 
          yet the international community (as a whole) does not do&nbsp; anything 
          about it, and pretends it's not happening. (If you don't believe us, 
          then go do a UN supervised survey, 80% of the people in Kashmir will 
          vote for Pakistan, the other 20% are Indian soldiers). Let us assure 
          you, people are dying in Kashmir as you read this. They have been dying 
          for the last 50 years and no one has done anything about it. India claims 
          it's Pakistani troops that it is so efficiently killing. oh really? 
          That's news to me. Since when did women and children and&nbsp; handicapped 
          people join the Pakistan army? Since when did the rape of innocent women 
          and children become an "effective method of stopping terrorists"?&nbsp;</font><FONT SIZE=2>We 
          are sick of this. We want the Indians to back off. I'll be damned if 
          they do, but nonetheless, we want you people to know exactly what's 
          going on and HAS&nbsp;been going on in Kashmir for the last 50 years. 
          While you people sit in your comfortable homes/offices with computer, 
          electricity, food, water, and most important of all; freedom,&nbsp; 
          eighteen people are brutally murdered in Kashmir by Indian soldiers 
          DAILY, and that's a&nbsp;highly rough estimate as another three hundred 
          or so people go 'missing' every day. And for what? Simply because they 
          want to believe in whatever they want. They want to be able to live 
          without fear of being killed, without worrying about&nbsp;&nbsp; where 
          to get their next meal, and where to run when the Indian soldiers come.&nbsp;</font></P>
