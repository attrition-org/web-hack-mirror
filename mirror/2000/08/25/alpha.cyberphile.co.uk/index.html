Please note that not all these defacements were identical; however, they are
so close and so numerous, and so clearly made with MSADC, that for sanity's
sake we're lumping them together.  As is stated on <a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/notes.html">
http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/notes.html</a>, "Changing one line on 10
domains is not a mass hack.  WE determine what is considered a mass hack and
what is not."
