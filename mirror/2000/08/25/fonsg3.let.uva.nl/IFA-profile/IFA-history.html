<p>The Institute of Phonetic Sciences (<i>IFA</i>, <i>leerstoelgroep Fonetische 
Wetenschappen Amsterdam</i>, ) belongs to the Faculty of Humanities of the 
<a href=http://www.uva.nl>University of Amsterdam</a>, the former municipal 
university.</p>

<hr><h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1922 the first courses in practical phonetics at the University of Amsterdam 
were given by Louise Kaiser, albeit in the physiological laboratory for the time 
being. In 1926 a chair in the Faculty of Arts was instituted and Louise Kaiser 
was appointed as a reader in Phonetics. The Physiological Laboratory, at the 
Jodenbreestraat 72, accommodated phonetics for several years, but in 1932 room 
was found for it in the building next to it. The new <b>Laboratory for Experimental 
Phonetics</b> was officially opened on November 30th 1933, some time after the First 
International Congress for Phonetic Sciences in 1932. It was thanks to the 
endeavour of Louise Kaiser that this congress took place in Amsterdam.</p>

<p>
In 1959 Hendrik Mol was appointed professor at this university 
while holding at the same time a chair at Leyden University. In 1967 he was 
appointed as a full professor in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>As a result of the construction of a road as an entrance to the tunnel
under the river IJ, the Phonetic Laboratory had to move from the Jodenbreestraat.
In 1963 the University bought a house on one of the famous canals in the 
centre of Amsterdam (Herengracht 338). The building, dating from the end of the 
17th century, was completely reconstructed. The conservation of the front and of 
the fa&ccedil;ade at the rear, as well as large parts of the interior, took much time. The 
interior of the building was brought up to date for experimental phonetic 
research, which included the construction of an anechoic room. In the middle of 1966 the new building 
was delivered and in 1967 the laboratory was officially opened by the mayor of Amsterdam,
president of the board of governors of Amsterdam 
University. On that occasion its name was changed to 
<b>Institute of Phonetic Sciences</b>.</p>
<p>Since 1982, the chair in Phonetic Sciences has been occupied by Louis Pols.</p>
