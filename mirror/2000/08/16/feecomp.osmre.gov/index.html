        <P>India's False claim on Kashmir.</P>
        <P><font size="2">On October 28th 1993, Robin Raphel stated that Washington 
          did not recognise the Instrument of Accession to India as meaning that 
          Kashmir is not forever more an integral part of India. She expressed 
          the view that the whole of Kashmir is disputed territory, the future 
          status of which must be determined in accordance with the wishes of 
          the people of Kashmir. </font></P>
        <P><font size="2">The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), based 
          in Geneva, recently, passed a resolution proclaiming Kashmir's accession 
          to India as bogus and null and void. The ICJ went further by condemning 
          the human rights violations in Kashmir. These events serve to highlight 
          the disputed status of Kashmir by focusing on the fraudulent nature 
          of the Instrument of Accession which was 'signed' by the Mahrajah of 
          Kashmir on 26th October 1947. </font></P>
        <P><font size="2">The Indians claim that the Instrument of Accession was 
          signed by Mahrajah Hari Singh on 26th October 1947, in which the Mahrajah 
          agreed to accede to India in return for military assistance to put down 
          the popular rebellion against him, seen at that time as an invasion 
          by tribesmen from neighbouring Pakistan. The details of the accession 
          were worked out between the Kashmiri Prime Minister, MC Mahajan and 
          the Indian official, VP Menon, in Dehli. However, there are serious 
          doubts about the signing of the document. Alastair Lamb (in his book, 
          Kashmir - A disputed legacy 1846-1990) points out that the Instrument 
          of Accession could not have been signed by the Mahrajah on 26th October 
          as he was travelling by road to Jammu (a distance of over 350 Km). </font></P>
        <P><font size="2">There is no evidence to suggest that a meeting or communication 
          of any kind took place on 26th October 1947. In fact it was on 27th 
          October 1947 that the Mahrajah was informed by his MC Mahajan and VP 
          Menon (who had flown into Srinagar), the the Instrument of Accession 
          had already been negotiated in Dehli. The Mahrajah did not in fact sign 
          the Instrument of Accession, if at all, until 27th October 1947. This 
          sheds doubts on the actions of the Indian regime. Some Indian troops 
          had already arrived and secured Srinagar airfield during the middle 
          of October 1947. On 26th October 1947, a further massive airlift brought 
          thousands of Indian troops to Kashmir - BEFORE the signing of the Accession. 
          Therefore, this situation begs the question: would the Mahrajah have 
          signed the Instrument of Accession had the Indian troops not been on 
          Kashmiri soil? </font></P>
        <P><font size="2">No satisfactory original of the Instrument of Accession 
          has ever been produced in an international forum; a published form has 
          always been shown. Further, the document was not presented to Pakistan 
          or to the UN. In the summer of 1995, the Indian authorities reported 
          the original document as lost or stolen. This sheds further doubt on 
          whether the Mahrajah actually signed the Instrument of Accession. The 
          Governor-General of India at the time, Lord Mountbatten, stipulated 
          that the permanent accession of Kashmir to the Indian Union will only 
          be accepted once the people of Kashmir had been consulted. He noted 
          in a letter to the Mahrajah, "the question of the states's accession 
          should be settled by a reference to the people". Furthermore, when the 
          Kashmir crisis broke out in October 1947, the principle of reference 
          to the people through plebiscite was already established as similar 
          disputes in some other states had been resolved this way.</font></P>
        <P><font size="2"> The Indian Prime Minister J Nehru, accepted this principle 
          and reiterated his position in a letter to the British Prime Minister 
          on 25th October 1947, "our view, which we have repeatedly made public, 
          is that the question of accession in any disputed territory must be 
          decided in accordance with the wishes of the people and we adhere to 
          this view". Therefore, at the time of the so-called accession, the Indian 
          regime accepted the principle of reference to the people. Based on this 
          principle, the Instrument of Accession should have been provisional 
          and conditional upon the outcome of a plebiscite. When India took the 
          Kashmir issue to the UN in 1948, it did so under article 35 of Chapter 
          VI which outlines the means for a peaceful settlement of disputes. </font></P>
        <P><font size="2">It is interesting to note here that India did not present 
          the Kashmir case under the UN Chapter VII which relates to acts of aggression 
          as India was alleging Pakistan. Therefore, it is evident that by raising 
          the issue under Chapter VI, India recognised the Kashmir issue as a 
          dispute, thus conceding that the Instrument of Accession had not confirmed 
          the state to be an integral part of India. India is still party to all 
          the UN resolutions on Kashmir. Moreover, India and Pakistan accepted 
          the UN resolutions of January 1948 calling for a plebiscite in Kashmir 
          to exercise the right of self-determination of the people of Kashmir. 
          India's acceptance of the UN resolutions establishes beyond a doubt, 
          that the future of status of Kashmir would be determined by its people. 
          Therefore, the Instrument of Accession, even if genuine, is rendered 
          null and void</font></P>
        <P><font size="2">. In the past, attempts to hold a plebiscite have been 
          met with fierce opposition from India. India has known, right from the 
          start, that the result of a plebiscite is a foregone conclusion - the 
          population of Kashmir would have voted to rid themselves of Indian rule.</font></P>
        <P><font size="2"> This has been the case from 26th October 1947 to the 
          present day. On the practicality of holding a plebiscite, a paper by 
          the US state department, presented to the UN on 2nd December 1947, noted 
          , "the dominion of India may attempt to establish the extant electoral 
          rolls on the basis for the referendum. As these rolls are said to contain 
          less than 7% of the population and were compiled on a basis which served 
          the weight to the members of the wealthiest educated Hindu majority 
          who would obviously vote for accession to India, it is important that 
          the electoral body should in fact be composed on a basis of complete 
          adult suffrage in order that the result of the referendum may be representative 
          of the actual wishes of the people of Kashmir".</font></P>
        <P><font size="2"> In view of the above arguments, it is clear that the 
          Indian case on Kashmir is politically, legally and morally unjustified. 
          The commitment made by India and the UN to allow the people of the state 
          to choose their own future are neither time bound nor do they provide 
          an escape clause for the Indian regime. It is only through fraud and 
          repression that India continues to forcefully occupy a large portion 
          of Kashmir</font></P>
        <P><font size="2">Please note, we are not a racist group, if you read 
          all our stuff, you must realise our anger. We see people killed everyday, 
          women raped, thick blood lying around, orphan children crying, and on 
          the other hand, zee media (Indians) blame Pakistan for massacres and 
          try to give a impression that Pakistan is responsible for the whole 
          Kashmir issue,and we are responsible for every violence in Kahsmir. 
          We like to apologise to any one that was offended by our defacement, 
          even if it's a Indian. </font></P>
