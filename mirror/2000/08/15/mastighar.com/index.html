          Ahmad Dar at Aluchabagh, Srinagar on 6-2-93. Two members of the forces 
          during late hours forcibly entered into the house dead drunk under the 
          pretext of search operations with the intention to rape but on making 
          hue and cry the locals of the area raised cries due to this reason the 
          forces did not succeed in their ill design. The next day when a complaint 
          was registered in Police station Sheergari, some officers of the forces 
          and local </font><font size="2">administration came for on-the-spot 
          inspection and assured the people for taking an action under the law 
          against the culprits. The local Police has not taken any action till 
          date against the culprits and the case is under investigation. </font></P>
        <P><font size="2">At Trehgam of District Kupwara in the first week of

          entered into the house of one Mohd. Ramzan Khan and the husband of the 
          lady, namely Mohd. Ramzan Khan was out of home. The forces raped the 
          poor lady one by one. The poor lady with folded hands requested the 
          brutal forces for not committing such an act as she was pregnant but 
          the brutal forces did not relent. The next day when the matter became 
          public, SP. and D.C. Kupwara, visited the spot. </font></P>

          Also her husband namely, Jalla Sheikh was not present on the date of
