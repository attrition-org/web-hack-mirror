        <P><font size="2">Chanapora - 7-3-90 CRPF personnel raided the house in 
          the locality-one woman aged 24 years was taken out of the kitchen and 
          raped by 20 CRPF personnels. Another woman was also raped . Two minor 
          girls of the age of 14 and 16 were molested. Badasgam Village - During 
          the intervening night of 17/18th May,1990, bus #1317 carrying 27 persons 
          holding valid permission from BSF, of a marriage party, was stopped 
          near Badasgam village, district Islamabad crossing about 23.30 hours 
          by BSF patrolling party . </font></P>
        <P><font size="2">The BSF personnel opened indiscriminate firing upon 
          the bus. M. Abdullah S/O Gani Malik R/O Lisser died instantaneously. 
          Bridegroom and eight other persons accompanying him received injuries.

          it had seventy-eight bullet-hole marks. A case was duly registered in 
          the concerned Police station and an inquiry was conducted by the then 
          DIG Kashmir and a medical report also obtained duly proved the lady 
          was raped. However despite the assurances given by the Government from 
          time to time for taking necessary action against the culprits, Government 
          authorities have failed to bring the culprits on record. The normal 
          trend of the Government during these years is to hide the atrocities 
          committed by the Indian armed and paramilitary forces in order to dodge 
          the Amenesty International and the world Human Rights Organizations.
