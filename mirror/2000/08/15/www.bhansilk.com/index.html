        <P><font size="2"><i>Rape, Molestion of Women in Kashmir Part 2, continued.</i></font></P>
        <P><font size="2">On 5-1-92, the forces during late hours entered in a 
          house at Barbar-Shah, Srinagar and committed rape. When it came in the 
          press that an old lady who was mentally upset, has been raped, the public 
          was moved and condemnation came from all quarters. In this regard an 
          F.I.R. stands registered in concerned Police station. After an F.I.R. 
          was registered, the lady was sent to hospital for medical examination; 
          the medical report confirmed the rape. On 13-1-92, at Tul Bugh, Sopore 
          of District Baramulla, the forces entered in to the house of one Gh. 
          Mohd. Bhat and, in the absence of male members, forcibly tried to rape 
          a lady. </font></P>
        <P><font size="2">But upon hue and cry raised by the said lady, the locals 
          came out and forces fired some bullets in air and ran away. The locals 
          later came out in a procession. An F.I.R. for attempt to rape stands 
          registered in the concerned Police station. On 1st August, 1992, two 
          British girls (sisters in relation) namely MS. Stevenson Jenet and Stevenson 
          Joane bearing passport numbers 731038/92 Tv. 324663/92 and 1630668, 
          Tv. 32463/92 respectively went on a Shikara Tour through river Jehlum 
          which passes through the main city.</font></P>
        <P><font size="2"> These ladies had arrived at srinagar on 31-7-92. They 
          left in the morning, along with two boatman and a guide. On reaching 
          near Zainakadal bridge located in downtown city, the forces stopped 
          them and took them in a houseboat along with the two sikara drivers 
          and guide. The forces had in a routine matter cordoned off the area 
          under the pretext of search operations. As reported the forces asked 
          them to lie down as the militants were just to attack on them. The forces 
          took the two sikara drivers and guide to some unknown place. When the 
          two sister's asked the forces to leave them as they were tourists, nobody 
          would listen . Then the forces attempted to rape them but as per the 
          ladies, they managed to escape when they jumped into the sikara which 
          was nearby . </font></P>
        <P><font size="2">The people came for their rescue and a pressman namely 
          Qaiser Mirza also interviewed them. When the news came to public and 
          the pressman in an interview on Voice of America heard the news, the 
          government came with a handout that no molestation of these two young 
          ladies has taken place and it was reported in the press that in the 
          army handout the ladies had manipulated the story at the behest of militants 
          in order to defame the forces. In this connection an F.I.R No. 168/92 
          U/S 376/511 and 354 stands registered in P/S M.R.Gunj, which is pending 
          investigation. In our previous report one lady journalist was raped 
          by the National security Guard Personnel and a final charge sheet had 
          been presented against those culprits as reported. The Government authorities 
          said that one person namely Mohd. Ayub Badyari who was the guide in 
          the sikara, was declared as a Pakistan Trained Militant. The government 
          has everything in their own hands in order to declare a person as a 
          militant or an innocent but after their goal is over. </font></P>
        <P><font size="2">A person after arrest is released half-dead due to the 
          third degree torture and that released person may or may not recover 
          is a question of luck. The government played a master card in order 
          to avoid humiliation at the hands of world community, when they declared 
          M.Ayub. Badyari as militant and the poor , innocent person is still 
          in custody. The two ladies cancelled their tour and left the valley 
          next day. Now they are in their own country and truth can be ascertained 
          form them. At Batakote, Handwara of district Kupwara, the forces had 
          been attacked at Achkote about two kilometers away from the place of 
          incident. The forces had suffered some causality; the forces in order 
          to take revenge, entered the area, and dragged out the locals out of 
          their houses. When the innocent old aged people wanted to inquire about 
          the behavior, the forces fired on the young people. The brutal forces 
          entered into a house and killed three women who tried to intervene after 
          their kiths and kins were shot at by the forces. The forces molested 
          and raped four ladies. </font></P>
        <P><font size="2">When the people came to know about the incident, a number 
          of human right activists and journalists reached the spot and in this 
          connection a case was already registered in the concerned Police station. 
          The lady victims were referred to a doctor for examination in order 
          to ascertain the presence of semen and marks of violence on the victims. 
          The case is under investigation and the local Police in almost in all 
          the cases which have been registered against the forces, have not proceeded 
          under law because of the helplessness better known to the them. On the 
          intervening night of 10/11-10-92, the forces entered into the village 
          of Cheek-E-Saidpora, Shopian in district Pulwama, under the pretext 
          of search operations and asked all the male members to assemble at a 
          particular place for identification purposes. The forces in absence 
          of the male members forcibly raped an 11 years minor girl and five other 
          ladies. On hue and cry of the ladies, the forces were compelled to lift 
          the cordon and the people after entering the homes were narrated the 
          tailful story by the female folk. When the news came known to the public, 
          some of the human right activists went to the spot and were first stopped 
          by the forces but later they entered the village.</font></P>
        <P><font size="2"> The victims were taken to hospital for medical check-ups; 
          a lady doctor Safia after medical examination gave a statement that 
          there were positive signs of rape and on the minor girl marks of violence 
          were also seen. This examination was done in presence of Dr. Bashir 
          Ahmad and Dr. A.N.Butt. One lady had given birth of child just some 
          months back. One Doctor namely Dulat Hussain has been arrested by the 
          forces and his whereabouts are not yet known. His mother has complained 
          that he has not returned home after the arrest and all doctors have 
          a reasonable belief that the government is deliberately causing harassment 
          to the doctors to stop them giving honest opinion. On 24-12-92, one 
          shepherd lady was raped by the Indian Armed Forces (BSF) and after registering 
          a complaint in the concerned Police station at Uri of District Baramulla, 
          some jawans of BSF reportedly kidnapped including her kids and husband. 
          The forces have been continuously harassing the people during crackdowns 
          in case somebody complains against them before the authorities. </font></P>
