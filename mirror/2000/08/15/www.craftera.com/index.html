        <P><font size="2">On 10-7-91, one lady Shara Khatoon an employee in a 
          private firm "Ansari Motors' Zero-Bridge, SGR., was raped by three armed 
          personnel during late hours. When her brother tried to save her from 
          the hands of the forces, he was beaten. He managed to jump through a 
          window due to which his arm was fractured. In this connection an F.I. 
          R has been registered in Police Station Kothibagh, Sgr. On 26/27-91, 
          during crackdown operations at at Kalaroos, Kupwara, woman folk were 
          molested by the forces. In Arizal Berwa, Badgham District four ladies 
          were raped by the forces during search operations on 12-8-91. On 3-9-91, 
          at Safanagri, Neloora, the forces entered into the houses of the helpless 
          ladies and raped two ladies. On 17-10-91, wife of one Gulla Gani R/O 
          Arigham, Badgham was raped by the forces and when she made hue and cry, 
          the forces shot her died. On 25-9-91, two army personnel raped an Australian 
          lady, namely, Hadeson at Ladakh; later she reported the matter to the 
          local Police and after the registration of case, the victim identified 
          the culprits.</font></P>
        <P><font size="2"> On 18-11-91, one woman was raped by the soldiers of 
          142 B.N (B.S.F.) at Islamabad. On investigating the lady identified 
          one soldier Jawan namely, Bomic. In Hilar Bahi Village of Islamabad 
          District on 5-12-91, the forces cordoned off a number of villages and 
          started indiscriminate firing due to which 20 persons were injured and 
          out of 20 persons five were seriously injured and two persons killed. 
          The forces entered into the houses of the locals and raped four married 
          ladies, including a six months pregnant lady, who later reported the 
          matter to District Authorities Islamabad. An F.I.R has been registered 
          in P/S Dooru Islamabad, which is under investigation. The ladies were 
          medically examined, which established the fact that the said ladies 
          had been raped.</font></P>
        <P><font size="2"> The forces in order to harass the people set ablaze 
          46 houses. After two days of incidents the pregnant lady gave birth 
          to a dead child. Due to the threat of the forces ladies of the locality 
          took shelter in the house of one Gh.Qadir Rather after the forces started 
          setting ablaze the houses of the innocent people. One married lady was 
          dragged out of a room in the said house and on gun point taken to third 
          floor of the building where she was raped by a Sikh armed personnel.The 
          poor lady tried her best to save her chastity but the brutal forces 
          did not pay any heed to her request. She requested them not to commit 
          any inhuman act because she was pregnant but the armed personnel raped 
          her. An another lady aged about 25 was taken into the second floor of 
          the same house and was raped by one more armed personnel. The poor lady 
          offered her wrist watch as a bribe for not committing the inhuman act 
          but the armed personnel raped her and other armed personnel were standing 
          as watchmen on the door.The forces later took the said wrist watch along 
          with them. An another lady who had come to save her house and movable 
          goods was raped in her own house. One more lady who had also came from 
          the field to save her valuables in the houses which the forces had set 
          ablaze, was also raped by the forces. The whole area was under seige 
          for number of days. Later few voluntarily organizations including local 
          journalists, visited the area confirming the incident.</font></P>
        <P><font size="2"> A Band was observed in whole of the valley for one 
          day as a mark of protest against the inhuman acts of the forces. Their 
          are number of F.I.R.'s lodged in different Police stations of the state 
          against the forces in which no action has been taken so far by the local 
          Police. The government authorities and their stooges are deliberately 
          avoiding to hand over the paramilitary forces wanted in the said F.I.R.'s. 
          The local Police is helpless. On 8-1-92, the Governor in a press conference 
          which was later reported in the local news papers on 9-1-92, admitted 
          the incident of rape.</font></P>
        <P><font size="2"> The people believe that the Government of India is 
          doing all this under a plan to suppress the people with the sole intention 
          that the people of State will give up their the demand of freedom. On 
          27-12-91, the forces entered into the a house of Gh. Mohd R/O Shilwat, 
          Baramulla and failed in their attempt to rape his wife, on the intervention 
          of her husband. The forces while leaving the house fired at him and 
          he received bullet injuries on his arm. </font></P>
