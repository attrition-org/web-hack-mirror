  <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">MartNet is a privately owned
  Internet Service Provider (ISP) located in Philadelphia, PA.
  We currently maintain one office and Data Center at 1241 Carpenter
  Street, Philadelphia, PA 19147. We also maintain a satellite

  With the recent surge of Emulators flooding the Net, the demand

Philosophy</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">We understand how difficult it
  can be for small companies without an army of Engineers to get
  connected to the Internet, and use the Internet as an effective
  way to communicate their ideas and reach a worldwide audience.
  Our goal at MartNet is to develop technical solutions that allow
  any individual or small business to effectively use the Internet,
  both as a marketing tool and as a communications medium--at a
  price that they can easily afford. We believe the best way to
  achieve this goal is through the use of standard, extensible,
  inexpensive hardware and software instead of proprietary, custom,
  expensive solutions common throughout the Internet today.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">MartNet Communications maintains
  professional working relationships with talented local programmers,
  artists, graphic designers, and Internet Marketing firms, who
  make their talents available to our customers at a reasonable
  cost. Together, we provide our customers with the best possible
  Internet Solutions at the lowest possible cost. <BR>

  <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">MartNet Communications was founded

  hopes of offering reliable, affordable, and easy-to use Internet

  able to offer a <I>full range</I> of both personal and business
  Internet Services which include the following: Dial-up access,
  Personal Unix shell accounts, advanced World Wide Web Development
  and Hosting, dedicated and co-located server hosting, high speed
  dedicated access, and affordable E-commerce solutions for small
  businesses.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Back in 1995, we ran MartNet
  out of our house in Philadelphia in our spare time, Word spread
  quickly, and suddenly we outgrew the house, ran out of 'spare-time',
  and realized that we had grown a rock solid business.  MartNet
  has become a full-time career for us. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Our primary business office and
  Data Center is in South Philadelphia, and we also maintain a

  make their talents available to MartNet customers at a reasonable
