          decision yesterday. I will make you come out of your homes and vote. 
          Don't think I will let you get away this time." - Indian puppet, Farooq 
          Abdullah. They waited but no one came to vote - The Indian Express (Delhi), 
          September 10, 1999. "Use the armed forces and drag the people out of

        <P>"This is not an incident that I will forget in a hurry. We hear more 
          complaints, witness more incidents. And finally stumble on the mother 
          of it all in Natnussa -- sheep being led to the slaughter of democracy."

        <P>"Today's poll boycott should be an eye-opener for Indian rulers and 
          they should learn a lesson from today's experience as people have again 
          reposed faith in APHC and boycotted the poll. The election drama has 
          proved a farce and government should read the writing on the wall and 
          accept our right of self determination", Hurriet chairman. - </P>
        <P>"I started my journey from United Nation's office at Sonawar and concluded 
          it at the Institute of Medical Sciences, Soura. All along the way, I 
          only saw security forces, not a single voter, in front of polling booths. 
          On the way, at Madina chowk, at 8:15 a.m, I observed that no voters 
          were coming to the booth. Then, I toured Maisuma, Saria Bala, Habba 
          Kadal and Chotta Bazar areas. Only a few voters, about 20, were seen 
          around the booth at Chota Bazaar. I did not see anybody interested in 
          casting his vote in these areas." - Ram Rattan Chaterjee. When people 
          in the Kashmir Valley voted last Sunday, about one in five polling booths 
          recorded a zero voter turnout -</P>
