<center><b>Rant of the day</b></center><font size=+1><br>

First off - a message for <b>G-Force Pakistan</b>. Guys, you have a noble cause. You are true hacktivists - you have
a good and just cause and you know exactly how to deliver your message to the people. But you are undermining your own
campaign; calling people "f**king c*nts" along with race hate messages is not the way to get people to listen or take action.
The UN will <u>not</u> take action if they are being pressurised by a group of people with obvious intelligence who ruin it
by abusing the very system they require the help from. Please, think carefully about how you put together your articles - which,
by the way, I wholeheartedly agree with: the US and UN only intervene if they can gain either monetary or political benefit from it.
Human rights are human rights whether they benefit Governments or otherwise. Hypocracy is no excuse for inaction. So keep up the
good work -- just try and cut down on the racial abuse and bad language OK? People will take you a lot more seriously.<br><br>

Also, it may help if you include a link to the various UN and international webpages in your messages - perhaps with a <b>mailto:</b>
link with a prepared subject line. This makes it easier for anyone seeing your hacks to put pressure on the relevant UN agencies etc.
If more and more people protest from around the world, it's only a matter of time before the mass media gets a hold of it and it
becomes a public issue. Once it's made into a public issue, the Governments/UN can then gain political merit from intervening, thus
bringing peace to the region. Play them at their own game - it's hard to swallow, but is possibly the only way to succeed.<br><br>

And now, for my next trick....<br><br>

....the recent G8 summit in Japan. Over 500million UK pounds were spent entertaining the
richest countries in the world, when they could have paid of the entire national debt of a country like Gambia with the same money.
And d'you know what?  They had the cheek to discuss methods of ending third-world poverty at the same meeting. Angry? I was spitting
with rage. Damned hypocritical nonsense, pure and simple. "Lets score a few cheap points with the public" tactics is all it was. Oh hoho,
well it doesn't wash with me - and I hope it doesn't wash with you. Did you know they were giving away free t-shirts and "party packs" to
all the journalists? The food was lovely, the building they used was custom-made for the event and nobody seems to care. Unbelievable.
I could go on for hours, but I just get too mad and I don't like anger because it clouds the thinking processes. Say "ohhmmmmmmmm"...
aah, thats better.<br><br>

And finally, a little rant:<br><br>

This upcoming American election... what a joke. Have you ever seen such a farce? I mean, how many people can name 5 of Bush's manifesto
promises? Has he got five? I dunno and I don't think the majority of the population knows. Placatory words, nicely tuned by clever
spin-doctors to suit the current state of mind is all he utters. Sound-bites, nothing more. No policy, no nothing. Haha, a reporter
even asked him to name 5 world leaders from countries like Serbia and he couldn't do it!! Foreign policy? What foreign policy? All he
cares about is getting into office and then he may think about what he's going to do with America. Ok, Clinton may not be perfect, but these
latest candidates for office are an offence to the general public's intelligence. All dressed up and nowhere to go...<br><br>
