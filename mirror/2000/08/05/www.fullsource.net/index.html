Hi kidz!<br>
I could've done koreagirl.net, combi-net.com and colloidasiver.co.kr too, but thats just a waste of time.<br>
I'll just list them here instead. =D<br>
admin dude: I patched your vulnerability, I've left details in /root/owned.<br>
index.html = index.old<br>
admin dude: cd /webroot; mv index.old index.html<br>
Aren't I considerate? =D<br>
<br>
Big big shouts to #suidrewt@efnet, doodoo crew, hi ryan, hi tnc, hi raven, hi tza!<br>
