<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">As much as We would
like to talk about Pakistan's right to having Kashmir as it's province
We won't. We are beyond that now. We don't really care who gets Kashmir.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">All we want is to
stop the violence in Kashmir. Innocent people are being killed daily by
Indian soldiers simply because of what these people believe in. The Kashmiris
support Pakistan despite the option of independence, yet the international
community (as a whole) does not do&nbsp; anything about it, and pretends
it's not happening. (If you don't believe us, then go do a UN supervised
survey, 80% of the people in Kashmir will vote for Pakistan, the other
20% are Indian soldiers). </font><font color="#999999">Let us assure you,
people are dieing in kashmir as you read this. they have been dieing for
the last 50 years and no one has done anything about it. india claims it's
pakistani troops that it is so efficiently killing. oh really? that's news
to me. since when did women and children and&nbsp; handicapped people join
the pakistan army? since when did the rape of innocent women and children
become an "effective method of stopping terrorists"?&nbsp;</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>We are sick of this. We want the Indians to back off. We will be damned
if they do,&nbsp;
<br>but nonetheless, we want you people to know exactly what's going on
and HAS&nbsp;
<br>been going on in Kashmir for the last 50 years. While you people sit
in your comfortable&nbsp;
<br>homes/offices with computer, electricity, food, water, and most important
of all; freedom,&nbsp;
<br>eighteen people are brutally murdered in Kashmir by Indian soldiers
DAILY, and that's a&nbsp;
<br>highly rough estimate as another three hundred or so people go 'missing'
every day.&nbsp;
<br>And for what? Simply because they want to believe in whatever they
want.&nbsp;
<br>They want to be able to live without fear of being killed, without
worrying about&nbsp;
<br>where to get their next meal, and where to run when the Indian soldiers
come.&nbsp;
<p>The point is not that who gets kashmir but the point is that kashmiri's
should have freedom!
<br>this is the era of economic strength and technology , ppl get media
attention easily these days so nobody can hold anyone back for longer period
..what we think that india should talk this matter out peacefully and leave
kashmir on its own just like bangladesh .. let them choose what they want
..thats what this is all about. and in that way both countries india and
PAKISTAN can spend their money more on the ppl and not for defence and
military machinery. And show the world the power and talent of this sub-continent
to the whole world.&nbsp; -Thanks
