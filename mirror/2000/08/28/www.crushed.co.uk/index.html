      <P align=left><font color="#808080" face="verdana" size="2">Stop the human 
        right violation Indians, It's about time. What are Indians trying to prove? 
        Killing people, raping innocent women, making children orphan? Pathetic!</font></P>
      <p><font color="#808080"><i>Unjustified Killings?</i></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#808080">Since 1989, an estimated 40,000 Kashmiris 
        have been killed by the Indian forces stationed in Kashmir. For the last 
        five years the people of the State have intensified their efforts in order 
        to invite the attention of the world community towards the "Kashmir Dispute", 
        though the people of the State had been fighting for their just cause 
        peacefully for the last forty eight years. Indian Government throughout 
        these four decades has been suppressing the people by illegal use of force, 
        putting them into the jails/ Interrogation centres etc. under draconian 
        laws. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#808080">Whenever any person demanded holding of 
        " Plebiscite", he has been put behind the bars. The Indian Forces, stationed 
        in Kashmir, have been given a free hand to kill any person they choose. 
        These powers have been given to them under the draconian laws like "Disturbed 
        Areas Act of 1990" and "Indian Armed Forces Act of 1990". Indifference 
        shown by world community to the miseries of people, have encouraged and 
        given a free hand to armed forces, to deal with the people, as they like. 
        In October 1992, the Indian Armed forces started to intensify the killing 
        of people immediately after their arrest. These operations have been carried 
        out under the code name of "Operation Tiger", "Operation Eagle" and "Operation 
        Shiva".</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#808080"> Now the armed forces have resorted to 
        another policy of "Catch and Kill" which means that no sooner a person 
        is taken into custody, within minutes he is brutally tortured and killed 
        . The dead body is then thrown into the street. In other cases, innocent 
        civilians are arrested and taken to border areas where they are shot. 
        The Indian government then publicises that these people were militants 
        killed in armed encounters with the troops. It is common practice for 
        the paramilitary forces to walk into a quiet village/town and start shooting 
        indiscriminately, killing innocent and unarmed civilians - all under the 
        pretence of crack-down operations against the Freedom-Fighters. In most 
        cases, innocent civilians are killed, women gang-raped and properties 
        set on fire. Below is a brief catalogue of the unjustified killings by 
        the Indian troops in Kashmir. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#808080">This catalogue is by no means complete 
        as thousands of killings go un-noticed and undocumented. The list given 
        below was compiled painstakingly by various Kashmiri Human-rights activists, 
        with great risks to their personal lives. </font></p>

      <p><font color="#808080"><em><i><font size="2">Due to these excesses, more 
        than 50,000 Kashmiris have been killed since 1990, with a lot more unaccounted 
        for. Thousands of helpless Muslim Kashmiris have fled across the Line-of-Control 
        to Azad Kashmir and are now living in refugee camps. The Hindu Pandit 
        population has not been immune to the recent unrest either. They have 
        also fled the valley in their thousands and are now living in refugee 
        camps in Jammu and India. </font></i></em></font></p>
