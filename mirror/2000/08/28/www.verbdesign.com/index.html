      <p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">What the 
        problems really are?</font></i></b></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Kashmiri people claim that the occupation 
        of Kashmir by India is illegal. They do not want to be part of India nor 
        do they want any Indian presence on their soil. The provisions of the 
        Instrument of Accession, if genuine, stipulated that the accession to 
        India was to be ratified by a plebiscite.Since 1947, India has occupied 
        Kashmir and has stalled, by whatever means at her disposal, the progress 
        towards the holding of a plebiscite - the original and the most universally 
        accepted solution. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">"There is no doubt that had a referendum 
        had been held in Kashmir, the vast majority of Kashmiris would have voted 
        to join Pakistan. Such a a referendum, in the form of a plebiscite, was 
        promised to the people of Kashmir by the Security Council in 1948. India 
        then accepted the principle of plebiscite but has since obstructed all 
        attempts at arranging one"- Kalim Siddiqui.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> In 1957, India further violated the sovereignty 
        of Kashmir by implementing a new State Constitution which, in effect, 
        incorporated the state into the Indian Union, in face of fierce protests 
        from the Kashmiri people, Pakistan and the UN. The new Constitution was 
        formally adopted on 26th January 1957 and it declared that "the state 
        of Jammu and Kashmir is and shall be an integral part of the Union of 
        India". Since the adoption of the Constitution, India has got itself into 
        a state of affairs, which can only be described as hypocritical and aggressive.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">On the one hand, India claims that Kashmir 
        is an integral part of the Indian Union. On the other hand India has signed 
        two agreements (Tashkent 1966, Shimla 1972) with Pakistan, in which India 
        agreed to resolve the Kashmiri dispute through bilateral and peaceful 
        means. Further, India is still party to numerous UN resolutions which 
        proclaim Kashmir to be a disputed territory. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">"It is hardly an exaggeration to say that 
        the whole history of Kashmir has been of misgovernment and oppression; 
        nor was this tradition dead in this century. And the political question 
        mark still hangs over the area despite India's past political control 
        and economic effort. Leaving the legal and moral issues aside, the economic 
        disruption caused by the de facto partition along the Cease-Fire line 
        has been deplorable" - J Dupuis.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> More recently, India has increased her 
        role as an oppressor in Kashmir. The deployment of 500,000 troops to silence 
        the voices of the Kashmiri people is seen as the only solution by the 
        Indian government, resulting in gross violations of human rights. These 
        crimes have been carried out as a matter of routine and some are well 
        documented by the various Human Rights agencies. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Please note, we are not a racist group, 
        if you read all our stuff, you must realise our anger. We see people killed 
        everyday, women raped, thick blood lying around, orphan children crying, 
        and on the other hand, zee media (Indians) blame Pakistan for massacres 
        and try to give a impression that Pakistan is responsible for the whole 
        Kashmir issue,and we are responsible for every violence in Kahsmir. We 
        like to apologise to any one that was offended by our defacement, even 
        if it's a Indian. </font></p>
