<br>
Congress agrees to hold hearing on Monday in response to public outrage over 
FBI's e-mail spy scheme

Immediate action required: Help us Kill the Carnivore!

On July 14 we issued a press release about an FBI cybersnooping device 
code-named Carnivore, which can scan millions of e-mails per second. Because 
Carnivore has unlimited power to spy on almost everyone with an e-mail 
account, it may be the biggest threat to your digital privacy ever.




 <br><br>Almost immediately after the existence of this project was disclosed in a 
July 
11 Wall Street Journal article, public outrage began to mount -- and now 
Congress has been pressured into holding hearings on Carnivore.

To capitalize on Monday's hearing before a House Judiciary Committee panel, 
the Libertarian Party has launched a campaign to "Kill the Carnivore"!

Politicians on Capitol Hill may be planning to mollify the public by 
starting 
an "investigation" into the system, but that's not enough: We want to stop 
the 
Carnivore in its tracks and kill it -- before it devours your privacy.

Please read this e-mail and *IMMEDIATELY* take the action below. Then 
forward 
this e-mail to friends, and ask them to do the same.

BACKGROUND: Carnivore is a hardware-software device that the FBI secretly 
developed at its lab in Quantico, Va.  Dubbed Carnivore because of its 
ability 
to find "the meat" among millions of e-mails, Carnivore scans every incoming 
and outgoing e-mail message on a network looking for telltale words or 
names, 
and saves those messages for later retrieval by law enforcement. Carnivore 
can 
also track instant messages, visits to websites, and Internet relay chat 
sessions.

The FBI admits that Carnivore will scan millions of e-mail messages from 
innocent people to find a tiny number of messages from people suspected of 
crimes.  That's no different than if the FBI opened everyone's mail hoping 
to 
find a letter from a criminal, or listened in on everyone's phone calls just 
in case a crime was being discussed.

Though Carnivore's existence was just publicly revealed, the FBI has already 
installed the device at dozens of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) around 
the 
country, and claims it has used it "fewer than 50 times" so far. In many 
cases, the FBI keeps the device in a locked cage on the ISP's premises, with 
agents making daily visits to retrieve the captured data.

Many ISPs have refused to allow the FBI to install Carnivore, citing 
concerns 
that the privacy of all their customers could be violated. But earlier this 
year, a federal judge ruled against one such ISP, leaving it no choice but 
to 
allow the FBI access to its system.

Predictably, the FBI promises to limit surveillance to messages from 
suspected 
hackers, terrorists, or drug dealers. But considering that this is the same 
agency that quietly inserted "roving telephone tap" authority into federal 
law 
and illegally turned over confidential personnel files to the Clinton White 
House, you shouldn't be expected to trust it with your confidential e-mails.

But Carnivore is more than a threat to your ordinary e-mail correspondence 
-- 
it also gives government bureaucrats the ability to spy on your online 
banking 
transactions, because it has the ability to monitor all digital 
communications. The bottom line is that your privacy won't be protected as 
long as Carnivore is on the loose.

At this point, no legislation to eliminate Carnivore has been proposed -- 
but 
with your help we can change that. Keep in mind that the Libertarian Party 
kicked off its campaign to kill the FDIC's "Know Your Customer" bank spy 
scheme last year before any legislation existed. But once we informed the 
public about this threat to their financial privacy, they swung into action 
and demanded an immediate end to the program. Americans flooded Capitol Hill 
with over 300,000 angry e-mails and phone calls, and within weeks, Know Your 
Customer was withdrawn.

We believe that once Americans learn about Carnivore's outrageous assault on 
their electronic privacy, they will demand legislation to abolish it as 
well.

That's why we're asking you to join the "Kill the Carnivore" campaign!


WHAT TO DO:

Call the Congressional switchboard, toll free, at 1-888-449- 3511. If that 
number is busy try 202-225-3121 or 202-224-3121. Then ask to speak to the 
office of your Congressional representative. The switchboard is open 24 
hours, 
and most House offices have voice mail, so please make the call as soon as 
you 
get this message.



WHAT TO SAY:

(1) Identify yourself and let them know you are a voter in their district. 
Leave your name, address, complete with ZIP code, and phone number. Please 
be 
brief, especially if you are leaving a message.

(2) Let them know that you're calling in response to Monday's hearing on the 
FBI's Carnivore e-mail spy scheme. (The hearing is being held by the House 
Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the Constitution.) Tell them that 
Carnivore poses an immediate threat to your e-mail privacy and that you want 
it abolished. Specifically, ask your representative to personally sponsor or 
co-sponsor legislation to abolish the FBI's Carnivore program now! Insist 
that 
you do *not* want an investigation, or Congressional hearings, or a "blue 
ribbon" commission -- you want to Kill the Carnivore now!

(3) Ask them to write you a letter spelling out their position on Carnivore, 
and detailing what they intend to do.

One more thing: Please forward this e-mail to friends, and ask them to call 
their representative, too.


Thank you for your help!
