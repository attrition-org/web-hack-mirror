<p> <font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica"><font size=2> Once upon a time, 
  adlist was visited by spammers, people who didn't really want to join, and people 
  who didn't like mail in their mailboxes. I might look like I am nagging too

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2">This is a <b>mailinglist.</b>

  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2"> All members must participate, 
    long time lurkers will be booted. No free rides. <b>This is why there is no 
    DIGEST! </b>If you need to sort adlist mails in a pile of it's own, subscribe 
    in the normal fashion, and filter them into their own box with a few simple 
    setting in your emailprogram. Do not ask me how to do this as I use another 
    email program than you, namely, pine, and can only give helpful instructions 
    regarding pine.</font>

      <b> Advertising</b> Anything about it really, including gossip.<br>
      <b>Laws, </b>advertising restrictions, ie on tobacco advertising and such, 
      and what is the effect of them.<br>
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2"><b>Purpose of this 
      list</b> <br>
      To scrape up a fun gang to party with at the next Cannes Lions awards show...*laff*<br>
      ..Seriously, To debate, To learn, To discuss. To make friends. You know. 
      People on ths list have met for coctails, Coffee and motorcyclerides even 
      though most of us live continents apart. This list has been running since 
      1997 and adlist has become a pool full of friends, with twenty still here 
      from the day it started! Also, we have <b> Archives !</b> Adlist has a full 
      year of archives of our old discussions for members only, a calender with 
      important events and a collection of links. These will all be available 
      to you when you become a member and you can add events and links yourself. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2"><b>What we don't talk 
      about, and you'll be booted if you try.</b></font></p>
    <p>&nbsp; 
  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2">Things that are not 
    related to advertising, <br>
    who cares?<br>
    </font> 
  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2">Web promoting, Net 
    advertising, Net marketing, Net design etc..<br>
    There are hundred other great to bad lists out there that do that. Find one

    <font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2">These are common sense 
    rules that I'm sure you already know, but you'd be suprised how many people 
    don't, that's why they are here so we all have a common ground on how to and 
    how not to behave on this list. Please don't be insulted if you know these 
    by heart.<br>
    I'm quite easy-going and let members get away with murder,but break these 
    once to often and you will be <b>banned</b> from the list. (I usually send 
    out a warning first, as everyone has a 'bad-mail-day'..*grin* )<br>
    <br>
    </font><blockquote><font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2"> </font> 
  <li> <font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2"><b>1) Use the subjectline 
    PROPERLY!!</b> <br>
    That means, don't clog it with a lot of silly RE: RE> RE: RE: RE> stuff that 
    Quickmail and outlook add to your subjectline, please make sure that the subject: 
    <b>adlist:subjectwhatever</b> is still readable for us others by deleting 
    the extra RE's before mailing it.<br>
    It also means that when you <b>change the subject, change the subjectline!</b> 
    Ok?<br>
    <br>
    If a thread/discussion really bores you, you can easily delete any mails with 
    that particular threads subjectline. <b>Never</b> mail the list saying; stop 
    talking about this-or-that subject, as you are neither God nor the moderator. 
    (I am, and don't you forget it!) As long a thread follows the <b>advertising 
    </b>subject people can talk about it for <u>years</u> if they like. If everybody 
    on this list keeps the Subject-line up to date you can easily delete any threads 
    that you are not interested in. Plain common sense. <br>
    <br>
    </font> 
  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2"><b>2) Don't write in 
    all caps.</b><br>
    It looks like your screaming. We don't like people who scream.<br>
    <br>
    </font> 
  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2"><b>3) Sign your name</b> 
    <br>
    Not everyone can remeber everybodys email by heart, a .sig file or just a 
    <b>"cya / Tom"</b> really makes things easier.<br>
    <br>
    </font> 
  <li> <font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2"><b> 4) Don't quote 
    entire email-messages!!!</b><br>
    We have all already seen it, and we <b>don't want to see it again,</b> as 
    it is a complete waste of space and makes reading and searching the archives 
    difficult. Sending the entire message again, with all the extra bytes added 
    from your emailer, is plain nasty for those who read the Digest and see things 
    repeated over and over - not to mention all that nasty computercode- jibberish 
    that Quickmail Outllook and other mailers add on. <b>PLEASE delete</b> that 
    junk before you reply to the mail!!<br>
    However, it <b>does really help</b> if you quote <u>a little</u> from the 
    original message that you are responding to so that everybody knows what you 
    are talking about instead of a replying "yeah" in a empty mail leaving the 
    rest of the list confused in what the hell you are talking about and generally 
    making you look like a moron. No offense. :))<br>
    <br>
    </font> 
  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2"><b> 5) Don't send HTML 
    'enhanced' messages</b><br>
    Some mailers have this options, notice it's just <b> some ,</b> HTML formatted 
    posts generally do not add any useful content to the discussion. <br>
    Further, the formatting process interferes with the digesting process, and 
    cause some subscribers to have problems reading your message.<br>
    Generally there is also a plain text segment that contains the identical information, 
    resulting in a waste of net resources. <br>
    Usually the creation of an HTML segment in addition to a plaintext segment 
    is the result of how your mail program is configured, often it is because 
    a default option has not been turned off.<br>
    In other words,HTML enhanced messages are a pain , so skip it. To "bold" something 
    that works in all mailers just use the classic _underline_ move. <br>
    <br>
    </font> 
  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2"><b>6) Don't send V-cards/ 
    don't send unrequested graphics.</b> <br>
    <b>NO</b> V- cards, or whatever they are called (an Outlook option) or any 
    other form of heavy graphics. If listmembers download at home, it's a pain 
    to wait. A waste of time. Stupid. Just stop it already. Those things are rude. 
    I don't wanna talk about it. Besides, the listserver will remove any attachments. 
    If you want to share an image and have no webspace of your own, mail it to 
    me and I'll put it up here.<br>
    <br>
    </font> 
  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2"><b>7) Don't send 'unsubscribe 
    me' messages to the list.</b><br>
    And don't bother the listmistress ie: <b>ME</b> with that either, I have my 
    hands full approving/denying people and updating the memberspage already. 
    That is why the unsubscribe adress is generated in each mail that ever passes 
    through the list, so you don't have to look long for it when you need it. 
    The sigfile of each mail sent through the list has the URL to the listrules 
    in it <b>and</b> the unsubscribe-adress in it for those of you who have selective 
    amnesia. <br>
    <br>
    </font> 
  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2"><b>8) Don't stray too 
    far Off Topic.</b><br>
    Off Topic questions can be asked and followed up in private mails. If you 
    want to bring up something off topic, please put OT in the subjectline. The 
    subject of this list is advertising and we like to keep it that way. However, 
    we have grown quite friendly and OT discussions will be replied to in private 
    if it's interesting enough. <br>
    <br>
    </font> 
  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica" size="2"><b>9) Don't be nasty.</b><br>
    You can agree and disagree passionatly about any given subject on the list, 
    but if you start calling people nasty names youre out. So far, no one has 
    broken this rule. :) Isn't that nice?<br>

    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana,Geneva,ARIAL,Helvetica"> Adlist is currently 
      running on a majordomo listserver. <br>
      If you are familiar with this, good, if not, here are a few helpful hints 
      also delivered in the first mail you receive from the list, the mail that 
      states &quot;please save this for future reference&quot; but I know that 
      all you guys delete it anyway. <i>*hahahaha*</i>:<br>
      <br>
      If you ever want to remove yourself from this mailing list, send the following 
      command in email to <br>
      <a href="mailto:adlist-request@sinless.org">adlist-request@sinless.org</a> 
      : <b>unsubscribe</b> <br>
      <br>
      Or you can send mail to <br>
      <a href="mailto:majordomo@sinless.org">majordomo@sinless.org</a> with the 
      following command in the body of your email message:<br>
      <br>
      <b>unsubscribe adlist </b><br>
      <br>
      or from another account, besides you@youaccount: <br>
      <br>
      <b>unsubscribe adlist you@youaccount<br>

      If you ever need to get in contact with the owner of the list,<br>
      (if you have trouble unsubscribing, or have questions about the list itself) 
      <br>
      send email to <a href="mailto:owner-adlist@sinless.org">owner-adlist@sinless.org</a>

      <br>
      There..Now those rules aren't to hard to follow eh? I may sound harse here, 
      but I soon discovered that ad-literate people don't always know netiqette.They 
      are what they say they are, common sense listrules. These rules or similar
