<table width=99% border=0><tr bgcolor="#FFFF99"><td width=500><p><b>Big vs. Small</b> <font face=Verdana,Arial,Helvetica size=2><br>by Avid on Tuesday, August 22 @ 00:51:08 PDT</td></tr><tr><td>Small agencies (creative consultants, boutiques, farms factories, 
brand doctors, idea-circuses, thought-spunkers, whatever they're 
called) have progressive philosophies. Large agencies have a 
financial plan. Small agencies pay respect to their staff (i.e. team 
members). Large agencies pay huge wages to keep their staff (i.e. 
employees).
<P>
Small agencies work with the client - only together can they make the 
brand strong. Large agencies have account people to keep the client 
at arms length - don't let them interfere in the advertising process.
<P>
So on, so forth.
<P>
But there are enough exceptions to disprove this child-theory.
<P>
TBWA GGT etc (I think there are more initials in their alphabetic 
soup of a name) have hundreds of people crammed into their London 
offices. Yet, they produce some highly creative and imaginative work 
(Playstation, fcuk) against the odds of a supposedly unmanageable 
size. The same can be said for Abbot Mead Vickers - take Guinness for 
example or the monster BMP DDB Needham - they produce the freshest 
work in the guise of Volkswagen.
<P>
Then, the flip side. The relatively small in comparison creative 
shit-hot-shop agency called St. Lukes in London has an envious 
philosophy that would make any creative worth her salt pay money to 
work there. Yet, their work is often embarrassingly bad (I would give 
examples but am unable to remember any - only their excellent Ikea 
campaigns manage to deliver).
Somehow the self-proclaimed beautiful strategies get drowned; perhaps 
the result of too many planning meetings or team-building get 
togethers or too much reverence to 'our friend the client.' The 
outcome is bland, the antithesis of all that was promised.
<P>
Even Mother, London's baby-genius, can, perversely, be said to suffer 
because of its size. Highly fashionable, it doesn't manage to 
permeate the mainstream with creative work, and gathers a reputation 
by working for relatively small clients within the safe confines of a 
Face-reading target market. Mother works on a planet where 
over-design masks under-ideas.
<P>
Large agencies tend to surprise more by breaking beyond their heavy 
bulk to produce good ideas, even when they're burdened with briefs 
that seek global campaigns. When they pull it off, they are producing 
far more creative work than a small agency which has its sticky paws 
on a small dotcom client or micro-brewery. Small agencies get the  
juicy sub-brands where mistakes can be afforded. Larger agencies have 
to sweat with the main important brands. Real creativity is pulling 
off a fresh idea for a generic household product, not wacky ideas for 
a local bagel shop chain.
<P>
However, despite this inescapably obvious fact, big agencies believe the hype.
<P>
We can see large agencies panic in the face of all these youthful 
start-ups and desperately grow their own volcanic acne by opening up 
things called Creative Pods within their own networks.
These are small cells protected against the big bad bureaucracy of 
the actual agency. The cells contain comfier sofas, funkier lighting 
and idea-rooms for clients. Cross through the door to the other side 
into the real agency, and you'll be back in the drab uniformity of 
greying filing cabinets and dusty vertical blinds.
<P>
What does this say, this invention of supposedly zesty 
mini-structures within the rusty infrastructure of the whole agency? 
Is it an admittance that their working methods are a mess? Would it 
not be better to invest the money in finding new ways to make their 
size more fluid, rather than avoiding the problem by dripping the 
essence of their creativity into a shielded shop?
<P>
Isn't it more valuable to think about restructuring the whole rather 
than disintegrating the parts? It's compartmentalising rather than 
bringing together. The future surely = disenfranchised disillusioned 
employees.
<P>
(And don't they know? The pod will doubtless break away once the 
fruits of their labour start to sprout. Soon they will become their 
own start up without the huge shadow of the big agency interfering 
all the time. This, of course, has its own problems as the new 
creative pod will get to fully develop its own highly original 
philosophy and meet agencies like St.Lukes on Up Your Own Arse 
Avenue.)
<P>

And what about seeking work? Big v. small, what should you choose?
Smaller agencies promise freedom, but as often as not, weigh you down 
with their good intentions. Your way of thinking could become diluted 
by joining their cult.
<P>
Larger agencies, through the anonymity of the size, can offer more 
opportunities to mess about and make mistakes. If the larger agency 
has an editing suite tucked away in their basement, or access to all 
the computer programmes you dreamed of, or a couple of dv cameras 
knocking about, you can experiment without making so much as a dent 
in their revenue. A smaller agency may not have the resources to give 
you a chance to play.
<P>
The good larger agencies, if you fight for it, will see no harm in 
throwing you the moist rump steak of a top tv brief, whereas the 
smaller agency, despite their reputation for risks, might find that a 
radio commercial 6 months down the line is a difficult thing to hand 
to you. The best choice is to try both and see where it clicks. Many 
hate the Mafia like intimacy of small agencies, preferring the social 
web of larger outfits.
<P>
This rant doesn't really have an end. Only to say, I know where I 
would rather work. Please end the rant for me, by posting your 
agreements or otherwise:- </td></tr></table><hr><form action="comments.php3" method=post><P><FONT color="#666600"><B>Your Name</B></FONT> Anonymous<P><FONT color="#666600"><B>Subject</B></FONT><BR><INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="subject" SIZE=50 maxlength=60 value="Re: Big vs. Small"><BR><P><FONT color="#666600"><B>Comment</B></FONT><BR><TEXTAREA wrap=virtual cols=50 rows=10 name=comment></TEXTAREA><br>
