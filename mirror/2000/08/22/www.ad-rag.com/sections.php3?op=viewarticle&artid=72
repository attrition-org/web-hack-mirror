        18 Culture <br>

      </h3>
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        Do you work somewhere that has a strong company culture? </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        What do I mean by that? 'Company culture'? Actually, it's quite a vague 
        concept, weightless yet omnipresent, ardently defended yet invisible. 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        You will know if you have a company culture. You will know because it 
        will be referred to by your co-workers ('Don't worry, it always takes 
        a few weeks to get into place'). You will know because you will feel acceptance 
        or rejection ('She's just not one of us. She's too . . . um . . . er . 
        . . you know'). You will know because your boss will tell you ('It's OK, 
        what you're doing. Don't get me wrong. It's just that it's not the way 
        we do things around here'). </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        All work places have codes of conduct, histories, habits, routines, nicknames, 
        catch phrases, myths, mission statements, Chairman's statements, objectives, 
        strategies, systems, procedures. Merge them all together and you can get 
        what might be passed off as company culture. But the real thing is decidedly 
        different and is distinctive from the many false cultures that can be 
        found operating deep within companies. These false cultures come in a 
        number of forms. Below I describe five that I can instantly recognize. 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        I guess at this point I should assert my own definitions. I think a culture 
        is very different from a vision, and both of these are very different 
        from a mission. They ought to be defined, because then their role is made 
        clear. By that, I am not suggesting that all companies need a vision,or 
        a mission, or indeed a culture in order to be successful. I would, however, 
        say that with them, you are likely to be more successful. </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        A vision is something you aim for. A long shot that you know you will 
        never fully achieve. Or if you do, it would dramatically change the company 
        you are in. It is an endless pursuit. Our vision at St Luke's is 'To Open 
        Minds'. </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        A mission is the method by which you aim to reach your vision. 0uts is 
        'By Creating Fascination'. </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        A culture is ... well ... I like how Ralph Stacey defined company cultures 
        in his excellent book Managing The Unknowable: </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        'Culture is a set of beliefs or assumptions that a group of people share 
        concerning how to see things, how to interpret events, what it is valid 
        to question, what answers are acceptable, how to behave toward others, 
        and how to do things. The culture of a group of people develops as they 
        associate with each other. The most important parts of it are unconscious, 
        and they cannot be imposed from outside, even by top management.' </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        This is 'proper culture' for me, because it is honest in what it describes 
        and practical in how it affects a company. Personally I fear cultures 
        that will not change, have to be constantly articulated or which cannot 
        thrive invisibly and instructively in the hearts and minds of every employee. 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        Stacey's culture is based on beliefs or assumptions that you all share. 
        But not all types of businesses can be bothered with beliefs or assumptions 
        unless they belong to the boss. 'Stop pussyfooting around and give me 
        the sales data. I didn't get where I am today by believing in beliefs 
        and assumptions,' the fictional CJ, head of Sunshine Desserts, might say. 
        In fact the pursuit of the bottom line not only drives culture into a 
        corner, it also dangerously and dismissively reconfigures it as niceynicey, 
        soft stuff to 'keep the troops happy'. </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        The presence and/or prevalence of the culture in your work place is defined 
        by the type of organisation you work for. Figure 3, first shown to me 
        by Dr. Bart Sayle, provides a useful tool to plot how individuals in society 
        prefer to conduct their lives and manage personal strategies within their 
        work. It has a simple premise. You either work alone or in groups of two 
        or more. And you either like to be bound by specific rules or prefer to 
        make agreements and unwritten laws bound by common consent. </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        How do you square up? (And there are no right or wrong answers.) Are you 
        the sort of person that believes in groups of people, teams maybe, or 
        departments? Do you like to know exactly where you are going and how things 
        will pan out for you? You will find yourself to the right of this diagram, 
        if that is so. </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        Or are you attracted to the personal charisma and skill sets of one person, 
        like Richard Branson or Bill Gates, or the person whose name is on the 
        letterhead (Tom Rooney Esg - Master Carpenter)? If so, you will find yourself 
        on the left of this diagram. </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        Do you like to have a written handbook of 'do's and don'ts'? Are there 
        fixed procedures for doing things that you can recite? Do you have rigid 
        salary grades and enjoy them, not least because everyone is treated with 
        systematic fairness? If you do then you will find yourself at the top 
        of this chart. </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        Or do you make it up as it goes along? Do you feel that there are 'different 
        strokes for different folks' ('Let's all take a half-day off on all Fridays 
        from May to September. Everyone agreed?'). Do you change your views and 
        systems according to the market, the weather, the people you have around 
        you? If you recognise this kind of environment, then you will find yourself 
        at the bottom of the chart. </font>

      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        If you are in the top right corner, you enjoy hierarchy. This corner is 
        the definition of a group of people joined by rules that they, or their 
        superiors, need to have in order to retain direction and control. The 
        rules will be a mixture of legal requirements (by the way, there are very 
        few legal obligations a company has to meet) and company codes (there 
        will be hundreds of these). What time you start in the morning and what 
        time you clock off. Who can make what decision and who can commit what 
        budget. Who reports to whom, when and where. And so on. These are codified 
        and logged, and handed out to you the day you join. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2">Most 
        companies are in this top right comer, as are most democracies. Democracies, 
        in fact, pride themselves on a system of government that is preordained 
        and inoculated against abuse or miscarriage of justice. The rules that 
        establish exactly how, when and where you vote, for example, are well 
        laid out. Whilst everybody may not know or care about the detail of the 
        rules of the organisation or government, the broad disciplinary procedures 
        are usually well known. The companies in the top right corner create lines 
        which you may or may not cross depending on who you are within the system. 
        For some the lines are thin and can be debated or crossed for individual, 
        specific reasons. For others the lines are thick and send out messages 
        - 'Cross this line at your peril'. These companies may flourish in this 
        corner of the diagram, and individuals within them may enjoy sharing the 
        same love of highly systematised procedures, but not all will. There will 
        be those individuals who occupy different corners of the diagram from 
        the company they are in, and the company of friends and associates they 
        keep in and out of the work place. Being a fish out of water in the work 
        place is a terrifying, but widespread malaise. Most of the time you keep 
        your deeply felt differences to yourself, until you feel you can make 
        a successful challenge, or until you can make a successful departure. 
        Doing this puts you under enormous stress.</font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        If you are personally in the bottom right comer, you would want to seek 
        out a company that others (and possibly you as well) will call a 'cult' 
        or a 'sect'. Companies here are not hierarchies, they are organisationally 
        much flatter. Instead of rules, companies in this comer subscribe to 'Sect' 
        and 'cult' are pejorative and other possible words like 'family' or 'dan', 
        used outside of their first and obvious meanings, suggest zealous religious 
        groups, or conjure up images of Bringham Young (who led the Mormons out 
        of Illinois in 1846 and established Salt Lake City as the base for Mormon 
        colonising), or the Cosa Nostra even. Apple of the early 80s was a company 
        like this. Steve Jobs would tell his fellow workers that they were going 
        to create something insanely great. Insanity is fine in this corner - 
        if that's where the leader is leading you! </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        If you think you live in the bottom left comer, you are in a personality 
        driven organisation. Hierarchical or flat, it makes no difference. Entrepreneurs 
        and dictators are to be found here. Sometimes the dictators are benign, 
        sometimes not. </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        The personality will infuse and infect the whole organisation with their 
        dynamism and entrepreneurial flair. Rules are pointless. People here make 
        it up instinctively as they go along. Intuition replaces information. 
        Virgin is like this. It is Richard Branson's company whether you like 
        it or not. And if you don't, maybe you should leave, because things won't 
        change. If you do, you will flourish. You will be well looked after and 
        made to feel 'one of the gang'. </font>

        If you are in the top left corner of the diagram, you are probably in 
        the worst of all places. You are an individual who conforms to a set of 
        personal guidelines or a personal interpretation of the company's rule 
        book. You are a 'Jobsworth', as we say in the UK. 'Oh, I couldn't do it 
        like that, it's more than my job's worth'. Severe cases here are lonely 
        and depressed because they wonder why they are amidst people who adhere 
        to different rules, different principles even. </font>

        Are there any organisations like this? I think so. Public services companies, 
        particularly the National Health Service (NHS). The NHS is Europe's biggest 
        employer, with over a million staff on its books. Despite a requirement 
        to provide health care, it does not have an overall mission statement. 
        It is often down to individual medical practitioners to make up their 
        own rules. People in the NHS are often there out of a sense of duty springing 
        from a personal desire to help. The same duty-driven people complain all 
        the time about the NHS and individually hold different ideas of how to 
        improve it. Take the issue of funding, for example. It will set chief 
        executive against consultant, doctor against nurse. Voters in an election 
        will hold a view, patients will speak first hand, the government will 
        take a different stance. beliefs and abide by agreements bound together 
        by trust. Interestingly there are no real positive words for companies 
        like this. </font>

        This diagram cannot represent tidy compartments. Human nature does not 
        so easily conform to these stereotypes. Rather, the diagram operates best 
        when seen as a series of 'magnetic pulls'. </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        The Body Shop is emotionally centred in the bottom left comer. Its staff 
        pull it to the bottom right and the City of London's rigorous financial 
        requirements pull it to the top right. (There is nothing more unnerving 
        to a finance man than constantly changing rules!) An individual in one 
        corner may belong to a company in another and may do well as the 'rogue 
        gene'or 'token maverick'. </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, sans-serif, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="2"> 
        Where you and your workplace are centred, the directions you are pulled 
        define an atmosphere of working conditions that sometimes add up to a 
        culture. But if your company is pulled in more than one direction, one 
        man's culture is another man's stricture. </font>

        Nike's culture was for years centred on its slogan 'Just Do It', which 
        is a kind of encouragement for everyone to join them in the bottom right 
        corner. Apple's culture of the 1980s was that of David versus Goliath. 
        The small (but smart) guy who was up against a brutish dominant force 
        (IBM, the Big Blue). Virgin employees are sent by 'Richard' to execute 
        his next brilliant idea. They are entrepreneurs in his image - restless, 
        slightly disorganised, creative, intuitive and almost always successful. 
        Virgin is a winning brand concept. </font>

        Cultures that are badly assembled, or wafer thin, fall prey to the vagaries 
        of my simple diagram. They are quickly vaporised when different agendas 
        come to the fore (profit generation versus ethical purchasing, for example) 
        and are equally quickly invoked to smother a low-quality product ('We're 
        a distribution-led company, we've got to keep the lines moving and keep 
        the sales force happy; there's always someone out there who will buy our 
        product'). </font>

        Ralph Stacey's definition of culture clearly places an emphasis on shared 
        views. Strong cultures are like the wind. Invisible, but you know when 
        they blow and everyone feels the same force, from the same direction. 
        I find it important to remember this as I ponder what I call the 'Five-P' 
        types of unreal cultures. I see manifestations of these 5-Ps a lot (and 
        at times in St. Luke's), and I like these manifestations much less than 
        what I choose to call the 'Proper (or Pure) Culture'- i.e. Stacey's. In 
        fact, I worry about them, because I see companies adhering to a cultural 
        mantra that is inconsistent with its present stakeholders or trading environment. 
        These cultures are designed to protect and serve the community of people 
        in the company, but more often they dupe and debilitate them. They are 
        insidious cultures, because they can all live in the body of one company 
        at the same time. The 'Five Ps' are: Past Cultures, Pile-It-High Cultures, 
        Prescribed Cultures, Pseudo Cultures and Precious Cultures. </font>
