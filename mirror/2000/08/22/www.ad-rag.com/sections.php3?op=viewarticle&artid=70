        I run these sites (<a href="http://ad-rag.com">adland,</a> and <a href="http://commercial-archive.com">commercial-archive.com</a>) 
        so that people like you (and people you like) can use it for personal 
        entertainment, information, education, communication, and a fun waste 
        of office hours. So go ahead and browse around all you like. You can even 
        download stuff from the site but <b>only</b> for non-commercial, personal 
        use. If you do, though, don't fool around with the copyright and other 
        notices all over the stuff. They're there for a really good reason. And 
        don't even think about distributing, modifying, transmitting, reusing, 
        re-posting, or anything else uncool with any of the stuff, including the 
        text, images, audio, and video, for public or commercial purposes unless 
        I give you, or more importantly, the owner of that copyright/trademark/brand/written 
        work gives you <u>written permission. </u> 
      </font></font> 
      <p> 
      <font size="2" face="VERDANA, ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"> If you visit my site 
      Adland, or commercial-archives' site you're also legally obligated to the 
      terms and conditions listed below and any other law or regulation that applies 
      to the site, the Internet, the World Wide Web, or California U.S.A. You 
      shouldn't access or browse the site if you have any problem with that, because

        <font size=2> 
        <li> For everyone's sake, just assume that everything on the site is copyrighted 
          unless I say it's not. So you can't use the stuff except how I say you 
          can on this page or anywhere else on the site without my written permission. 
          You cannot repost, redistribute or even QUOTE any of the text or images 
          from this site anywhere without written permission from me! The text 
          and rants belong to me, the images of the ads belong to the advertisers 
          and the text from books belong to their publishers.It's not likely that 
          I or the owners of their respective copyrights will give you permission 
          anyway. In fact, even if I wanted to, those dang lawyers are likely 
          to veto any deal anyway. So it's better you don't even ask. 
          <p> 
        <li> Reading (stealing) bits of my HTML code however, doesn't bug me at 
          all. Go ahead if you want to. I can't really stop you and can't be bothered 
          trying. If you steal the <i><b>contents</b></i> of these sites however, 
          I'll turn nasty. Content <u>includes</u> everything written by me, and 
          guestspeakers, on these sites. Any images on Adland and UN Ltd.tm are 
          copyrighted by Dabitch and UN ltd and their respective clients. Don't 
          even think of touching that. 
          <p> 
        <li> While I try to include accurate stuff on the site, I'm not promising 
          you it's accurate. In fact, I'm not promising you anything except fun 
          and entertainment. So if you use stuff on the site, you're doing it 
          at your own risk. Don't call me if there's a problem because I assume 
          no liability or responsibility for errors or omissions on the site. 
          <p> 
        <li> If you don't want the world to know something, don't post in on the 
          site in any bulletin board or anyplace else. That's because anything 
          you disclose to me is mine. That's right -- mine. So I can do anything 
          I want with the stuff you post. I can reproduce it, disclose it, transmit 
          it, publish it, broadcast it, and post it someplace else. I can even 
          send it to your mother (as soon as I find her address). Not only that, 
          I can even use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques you post 
          anyway I want to, including, developing, manufacturing and marketing 
          products or other stuff using the information you post. Not that I would 
          care to, but I could, ok? 
          <p> 
        <li> You'll probably notice I've linked my site to lots of others. While 
          that's cool, it doesn't mean I've looked <i>that close</i> at all those 
          sites, much less checked them out periodically to see what's going on. 
          So don't blame me if some site you link to is bad or has stuff on it 
          that offends you or your pets. Go ahead and and surf the links, but 
          remember, it at your own risk.. Mmmm'K?. 
          <p> 
        <li> That brings me to what you do on my own site. While I occasionally 
          look at the posting in my discussion groups or in my guest book, I take 
          no responsibility and assume no liability for the content of those locations 
          or for any mistakes, defamation, libel, slander, omissions, falsehoods, 
          obscenity, pornography, or profanity you might encounter when you visit 
          such places on my site. And don't be stupid by posting or transmitting 
          any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, scandalous, 
          inflammatory, pornographic, nasty, mean, or profane material or any 
          material that law enforcement types my consider a criminal offense, 
          get someone in court on a civil lawsuit, or for that matter violate 
          any law -- anywhere, anytime. While I certainly respect your privacy 
          and right to free speech, I have no choice but to fully cooperate with 
          any law enforcement authorities or court which might ask me who might 
          have posted nasty stuff on my site. 
          <p> 
        <li> Software that I put up on these sites is protected by all sorts of 
          patriotic U.S. laws. Because of that, you can't download or send the 
          software to anyone in the vacation travel spots of <font color="#993300">Cuba, 
          Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Iran, Syria,</font> or any other country where 
          United States has embargoed goods; or (get this) to anyone on the <font color="#993300">United 
          States Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals</font>, 
          the<font color="#993300"> U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders</font>, 
          or the <font color="#993300">FBI's Most Wanted Internet Creeps List</font> 
          (ok, so I'm just kidding on that last one). As if that were not tough 
          enough, if you live in or are a national of any of those lovely places, 
          you're not even supposed to be reading this page, so get the f*ck outta 
          here! 
          <p> 
        <li> I'm also allowed to change this page and anything else on the site 
          any time I want to. That's because it's mine and I have means to do 
          so. If I do change the page, then you're bound by those changes, too, 
          whenever you visit my site. Tough. 
          <p> 
        <li> Pictures of people or places shown on the site are either my property 
          or someone else's property. No matter what, it's definitely not your 
          property. You or any of your net-friends can't use it unless I said 
          you can on this page or somewhere else on the site. And guess what -- 
          I won't say yes. So be careful, kid, because unauthorized use may violate 
          all sorts of nasty laws. Be smart, keep the stuff you download to yourself. 
          <p> 
        <li> There's also a lot of trademarks, logos, and service marks on the 
          site that either I own or I'm using with someone else's permission. 
          So don't think you have any kind of license or right to use them, because 
          you don't and I'm not about to give you one. If you don't leave them 
          alone and mess with my trademarks, logos and service marks on my site, 
          I'll probably get real nasty; so will the companies that own the other 
          trademarks, logos and service marks. That means that I'm likely to sue 
          you or to ask a prosecutor to come after you for messing around with 
          my property or the property of others. 
          <p> 
        <li> I and anybody else who helped me create, produce, or deliver the 
          site are not liable for any damages you suffer when you use it. In particular, 
          my lawyers want you to know that my disclaimer includes "direct, incidental, 
          consequential, indirect, or punitive damages arising out of your access 
          to, or use of, the site. Without limiting the foregoing, everything

          WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR 
          NON INFRINGEMENT.<br>
          Please note that some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of implied 
          warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you. Check 
          your local laws for any restrictions or limitations regarding the exclusion 
          of implied warranties. " Alright, so that was unreadable legal bull, 
          but here's the bottom line -- I'm not responsible if you're browsing 
          around and the site damages you or your computer or infects it with 
          any nasty viruses. I seriously doubt that can happen, but if it does, 
          don't call me. 
          <p>
