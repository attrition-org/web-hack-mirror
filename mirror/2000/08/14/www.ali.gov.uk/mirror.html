Cigarettes, fags, tabs, ciggies... whatever you call them. I heard a scary statistic today: in Britain a person dies from a smoking related
disease every 5 minutes. Every 300 seconds. Wow. I couldn't believe it.<br><br>

"Tobacco taxation amounts to 10 billion [British Pounds] per year"<br><br>
"Every year, about 120,000 people in the UK are killed by smoking"<br><br>

I'm really glad I gave up four months ago. My lungs should heal up in a few years, with a bit of luck. But just think, the government makes
10,000,000,000 pounds every year from the deaths of 120,000 of it's citizens. Direct profit from misery, illness and death.<br><br>

All this makes me think of the BSE incident. Remember that? A couple of people every year <i>might have died</i> from CJD infected meat so the government put
a ban on the retail of beef-on-the bone, placing a great hardship on farmers and butchers. 120,000 people <i>will definately die</i> from
smoking every year, and the government puts huge taxes on cigarettes and lines the pockets of fat-cat businessmen in the process. Hello? Am
I the only one to see something wrong with this?<br><br>

What justification could the government use to let us know it is in the best interest of the country? Lets see:<br><Br>
<ul>
	"People have freedom of choice to smoke" -- The same applies to junkies and crack-heads. Should we tax them?<br><br>
	"There's nothing we can do, too many people enjoy it" -- Did that stop the beef ban?<br><br>
	"We need the tax money" -- Ahhh, the honest answer. The truth comes out eventually.<br><br>
</ul>

The government needs to stop it's hypocracy and admit that they are in it for the money. Oh wait... they can't, because if they do, that will be
an admission that money is more important than life - which would not be good for votes. Or, they could admit that smoking is legal because
it is the right of the individual to do so. But then, that would also apply to marijuana... are they willing to make that legal?<br><br>

I have no answers to the above questions, nor do I have any suggestions as to what the government should do about the problem. I merely want
to get some of this off my chest and perhaps stimulate some thought in anybody that happens to be reading this. Maybe someone will stop
smoking as a result of seeing this page, but I doubt it... by the way, did you know that the majority of middle-aged male smokers are impotent as a direct
consequence of smoking?<br><br>

(1) Yes, this is an NT site. No, I'm not an RDS kiddie. The vulnerability in this server was found by me - the exploit code is 100% mine. Don't
believe me? Send me a mail and ask for the source code. If you are very nice, I <i>might</i> share it with you. Script kiddies need not apply.
All mail asking "how do I hack?" will go straight to /dev/null. I'm sick of people who can't spell, use bad grammar, aren't polite and are
not willing to learn for themselves. Capish?<br><br>

(2) This is not a mass-hack, but a server-by-server jobby. Just so you know.<br><br>

My mail address has changed from antionline. It's now: <font color=#00ff00>herbless</font>@hushmail.org<br><br>

<font size=+1><center><b><u>For the sysadmin</u></b><br></center></font><br>

Your original file now has a ".old" extension. If you want to know how this hack was performed (and a suitable fix) then email me. I'd be
grateful if you could extend me the courtesy of using your real email - don't pretend to be someone you're not. Please accept my apologies
for using your webserver as a vehicle for my ramblings... ".gov" servers are just a little bit more tempting than anything else.<br><br>

Not many - I work alone. To the guy from Krakr0k Industries - cheers..... Alys - love always.....Bro - stop using Windoze!<Br><br>
