        <P><font size="2">Indian armed forces have let loose a reign of terror 
          and are pursuing with the policy of unabated killings, torture and brutal 
          methods of killings in Kashmir State since 1989. Despite the fact that 
          international community and Human Rights Organizations all over the 
          World have registered constant protests against this policy of Indian 
          Government in Kashmir, no change is visible in the acts of repressions 
          and suppression at the hands of forces. In fact the death due to torture 
          and in custody have alarmingly increased. Many such incidents go un-noticed 
          due to severe restrictions on the movement of people, constant crackdowns, 
          curfews and other repressive measures by the forces. However, the Forum 
          has been able to collect details about some such incidents which are 
          based on personal information, print and electronic media and data collected 
          by Human Rights activists. The officials and armed forces are in the 
          habit of naming such killings as the result of so called encounters. 
          But the fact of the situation is that most of such arrests are made 
          during crackdown operations where people of the area are collected first, 
          bodily searched before their entry in the specified area and then subjected 
          to identification. The arrests of the people are made when such persons 
          are totally unarmed and there is no possibility of any encounter with 
          the forces. Such fake encounters are carved out by the forces in order 
          to save themselves from the wrath of international community and over 
          all public resentment. The cases below highligh the extent of the problem.
