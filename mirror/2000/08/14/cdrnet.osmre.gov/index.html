<b><u>note to admin:</u></b> <b>the hole was patched</b>, no files were
deleted, not much was looked at, old index backed up
<br>
<br>
another .gov owned, its funny how low the US govs security is.  if no one
has the time to secure them, they should just be taken offline
completely. oh well, they will learn eventully.
<br>
<br>
another thing that needs to be discussed, why the fuck is everybody
rehacking everything i deface? fuck all you faggets out there rehacking my
shit.  this is what made me start patching the boxen i hack.
