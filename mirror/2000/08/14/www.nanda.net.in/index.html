        <p>&nbsp;</p><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Held 
          Jammu:</b></font><font size="2"> Five Indian border security guards 
          were killed and 72 injured while the Indian troops killed 10 Muslim 
          militants in held Kashmir on Sunday, officials said. The Indian army 
          said the troops shot the militants in a fierce firefight in the vicinity 
          of two blasts, which killed the soldiers. Officials said they did not 
          know which groups the guerrillas belonged to, adding that the fighting 
          was continuing. The clashes came as New Delhi sounded a nation-wide 
          high alert ahead of Tuesday's Independence Day celebrations. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">The first explosion killed four border 
          guards and injured 32 others travelling on a bus in held Kashmir on 
          Sunday, Inspector General of Jammu Police RV Raju said. He said that 
          the blast occurred inside a Border Security Force (BSF) bus on a highway 
          near Kud township. The bomb exploded in the luggage hold of the bus 
          at around 8:30 am, he added. "Four BSF personnel died on the spot. Doctors 
          say that at least 10 men are battling for their lives," Raju said. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">A BSF spokesman said the bus was carrying 
          50 guards who were reporting back to work in Srinagar city after a short 
          vacation. "The force of the explosion ripped open the back of the bus 
          and smashed all the window panes. At least 32 of our men have been injured, 
          some with severe burns and head injuries," he added. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">Five-and-a-half hours later, a landmine 
          killed one border guard and left 40 others injured, wrecking two BSF 
          vehicles carrying soldiers to Srinagar, officials said. BSF Deputy Inspector 
          General RN Sharma said the attack, at 2:00 pm, occurred at almost the 
          same spot as the earlier explosion. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">Meanwhile, Kashmiri militant group -- the 
          Hizbul Mujahideen -- claimed responsibility of both the attacks. Hizbul 
          spokesman Salim Hashmi said the group planted the mine, which destroyed 
          a BSF) bus near Kud township. "We are committed to end the Indian rule 
          in held Kashmir and our activities will escalate," he said. "Until India 
          accepts our demands we will intensify our attacks on Indian security 
          forces and military installations," Hashmi told AFP.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"> Meanwhile, the Indian officials said the 
          country will be put under tight security from Monday to prevent attacks 
          by the Muslim militant during Independence Day celebrations set for 
          Tuesday. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">The Indian capital is likely to be declared 
          a no-fly zone during an address by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. 
          The venue itself will be guarded by 50,000 policemen, a police source 
          said. Meanwhile, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) called for 
          a strike on Tuesday to mark the Indian Independence Day as a black day. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">Security patrols are stepped up and house-to-house 
          searches started in Srinagar, where Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah is 
          due to hoist the Indian flag on Tuesday. "We expect more violence, already 
          there has been more damage done in the run-up to this year's Independence 
          Day than in the last one or two years," said an official of the paramilitary 
          Border Security Force. Tensions have risen again in held Kashmir after 
          the Hizbul Mujahideen called off a 15-day ceasefire, citing New Delhi's 
          refusal to accept three-way talks, including Pakistan to resolve the 
          53-year-old Kashmir dispute. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">"We have intensified patrolling, set up 
          intelligence teams and in select areas launched search and cordon operations. 
          It is not possible to hermetically seal the city unless you freeze all 
          civilian movement," he observed. Motorists have been asked to keep their 
          cars off the main streets of held Srinagar after this week's car bomb. 
          Hundreds of men were on Sunday ordered out of their homes in the city's 
          Maisuma locality while the security forces searched their homes for 
          weapons and checked identities. </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2">India is literally scared of the Mujahideen 
          and that's the way it should be, the Indians deserve it. Why, you ask? 
          That's because India has constantly terrorised and denied all our Kashmiri 
          brothers their right of freedom, and yet, the US gets it's President's
