        <P><font size="2">For the vast majority of time since 1947, the people 
          of the state of Jammu and Kashmir pursued non-violent methods to get 
          the referendum held. The Kashmiri people are now fighting to implement 
          what has been promised to them. They want to come out of the physiological 
          limbo of not knowing if they are Indian, Pakistani or Kashmiri. They 
          want the matter sorted once and for all. It is high time to sort this 
          issue out for the following reasons: Over 50,000 Kashmiri's have been 
          killed since 1990. Over 1,000 Indian army people have been killed since 
          1990. Its time India lived up to its promises. The whole of South Asia 
          is unstable due to this problem, especially now that both India and 
          Pakistan are nuclear powers. Two great nations namely Pakistan and India 
          have to spend enormous amount of money on their armed forces because 
          of this problem. When India and Pakistan takes 5 steps forward the Kashmir 
          issue takes them back 6 steps. There has never been a better time to 
          sort this problem. The cold war has ended, we are at the dawn of the 
          21st century and the potential consequences of not sorting it out are 
          two high to contemplate.</font></P>
        <P><font size="2">Please note, we are not a racist group, if you read 
          all our stuff, you must realise our anger. We see people killed everyday, 
          women raped, thick blood lying around, orphan children crying, and on 
          the other hand, zee media (Indians) blame Pakistan for massacres and 
          try to give a impression that Pakistan is responsible for the whole 
          Kashmir issue,and we are responsible for every violence in Kahsmir. 
          We like to apologise to any one that was offended by our defacement, 
          even if it's a Indian. </font></P>
