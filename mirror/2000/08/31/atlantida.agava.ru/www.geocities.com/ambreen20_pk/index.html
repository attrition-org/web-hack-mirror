<p><font color="#00FF00">You have heard the Pakistani and Indian view. Now hear the views of
the most important party to the dispute, the Kashmiri
<br>people.</font>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Kashmir Problem in a Nutshell</font>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Since 1947, the people of the state of Jammu and Kashmir (commonly referred
to as just, Kashmir) have been promised by
<br>India and the International community that its final status would be
decided by a referendum. However that promise until now
<br>has not been fulfilled. Below are some of the promises which the former
Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru made.
<br>For the vast majority of time since 1947, the people of the state of
Jammu and Kashmir pursued non-violent methods to get the
<br>referendum held. The Kashmiri people are now fighting to implement
what has been promised to them. They want to come out
<br>of the physiological limbo of not knowing if they are Indian, Pakistani
or Kashmiri. They want the matter sorted once and for
<br>all.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<p>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#00FF00">It is high time to sort this issue out for the following reasons:</font></b>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Over 50,000 Kashmiri's have been killed since 1990.</font>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Over 1,000 Indian army people have been killed since 1990.</font>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Its time India lived up to its promises.</font>
<p><font color="#00FF00">The whole of South Asia is unstable due to this problem, especially
now that both India and Pakistan are
<br>nuclear powers.</font>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Two great nations namely Pakistan and India have to spend enormous amount
of money on their armed
<br>forces because of this problem.</font>
<p><font color="#00FF00">When India and Pakistan takes 5 steps forward the Kashmir issue takes
them back 6 steps.</font>
<p><font color="#00FF00">There has never been a better time to sort this problem. The cold war
has ended, we are at the dawn of the
<br>21st century and the potential consequences of not sorting it out are
two high to contemplate.</font>
<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#00FF00">Neither Pakistan, India nor Kashmir will win in a war, especially if
it goes nuclear.</font>
<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><b><i><u><font color="#00FF00">We just want to create global awareness so that people might
know what Indians are doing to Kashmiris!</font></u></i></b>
