  New Delhi begins talks with Hizb nominee: 30 killed in Kashmir Monitoring Desk 
  KARACHI, Aug 1: The process of talks between New Delhi and the Hizbul Mujahideen 
  was set in motion on Tuesday as Indian home ministry officials contacted the 
  outfit's nominee for negotiations here. Fazal Haq Qureshi, a veteran freedom 
  struggle leader heading the Jammu and Kashmir People's Political Front, nominated 
  as the negotiator by Hizbul Mujahideen, confirmed that officials of the home 
  ministry spoke to him on phone on Tuesday morning. However, Qureshi refused 
  to divulge details of his interaction with the officials but said: "I told them 
  that I am available for anybody," according to a PTI report monitored here. 
  He said he was waiting for "guidelines" from the Hizbul Mujahideen to go ahead 
  with the talks with New Delhi. Qureshi said he had been in touch with the Hizbul 
  Mujahideen prior to its announcement of unilateral ceasefire for three months. 
  "I am in touch with the Hizbul Mujahideen as before. Even before they (Hizb) 
  announced the ceasefire, I was in contact with them". APPEAL: The Hizbul Mujahideen 
  appealed on Tuesday to other groups to lay down their weapons and urged Indian 
  forces to suspend operations in occupied Kashmir, says an AFP report from Srinagar. 
  In its statement, the Hizbul Mujahideen said: "We appeal to other groups to 
  support the ceasefire and we expect the Indian troops to suspend their offensive 
  operations against all the groups." The statement said authorities had been 
  asked to contact a leader, Fazal-Haq Qureshi. BREAKTHROUGH: The sudden and unprecedented 
  truce between India and the Hizbul Mujahideen has kindled a flicker of hope 
  for peace in occupied Kashmir. Some believe the developments that have unfolded 
  so rapidly in recent weeks could culminate in a meeting between Chief Executive 
  Gen Pervez Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee at the UN 
  Assembly next month. That would indeed be a breakthrough given that since last 
  year's undeclared war in Kargil, New Delhi has refused to hold talks with Islamabad. 
  But analysts say such hope could easily be snuffed out by New Delhi's reluctance 
  to include Islamabad in negotiations on Kashmir, and its unwillingness to make 
  concessions on sovereignty. There could also be an escalation of violence as 
  diehard groups - such as Lashkar-i-Taiba and Jaish-i-Mohammad - try to undermine 
  the unilateral ceasefire implemented by the Hizbul Mujahideen last week. The 
  first evidence came quickly, with the Lashkar-i-Taiba launching a fierce attack 
  on an Indian army camp in occupied Kashmir on Sunday night. CURFEW: Meanwhile, 
  an indefinite curfew was imposed on Tuesday in a district of occupied Kashmir 
  after the killing of 23 people, including five Hindu pilgrims at a crowded marketplace, 
  a police official said. The official said a group of unidentified gunmen swooped 
  on a market in Pahalgam, 97kms south of Srinagar, and fired indiscriminately 
  at shoppers. "The Pahalgam market which was targeted lies on the Hindu pilgrimage 
  route to the holy Amarnath cave in southern Kashmir. That is why the dead and 
  the injured are mainly from the Hindu community," said the official. "This incident 
  could spark off a lot of communal violence. That is why we have cordoned off 
  the area and stepped up security." A team, led by a senior police officer, rushed 
  to the spot as people from the Hindu community thronged the streets shouting 
  anti-Muslim and anti-government slogans outside police stations, hospitals and 
  government buildings. The district administration imposed an indefinite curfew 
  with police and paramilitary soldiers fanning out across the area after a mob 
  indulged in heavy stone-pelting, damaging government property. "The police have 
  acted promptly and resorted to baton charges and firing to scare away the mobs," 
  the official said. The situation was "calm", he said, but admitted to an "undercurrent 
  of tension" in the southern district where Pahalgam is located. In a separate 
  incident, Indian soldiers shot dead a freedom fighter after he threw two grenades 
  at a government registration office in occupied Jammu, police said. "Police 
  challenged four suspicious-looking men lurking around a government registration 
  office. One of them threw two grenades in the direction of the office when the 
  police shot him dead," said a police official. "Three of the rebels then dashed 
  off in the direction of a crowded nearby residential colony in Jammu called 
  Gujjar Nagar. The police were unable to apprehend them despite firing several 
  rounds," the official said. A number of Hindu pilgrims were standing outside 
  the government office waiting to get their travel permits at the time of the 
  incident. Police say the Hindu pilgrims may have been a possible target. Police 
  added that two freedom fighters were also killed on Tuesday in an encounter 
  with the Indian army in a forest near Pahalgam.-AFP </P>
