  going on? 105 people have been VERY brutuly murdered! Yes murdered! and the 
  Indian fags are blaming it on Pakistan (as always, as sed before they have a 
  habbit of lieing.) Those clueless faggots with their media are giving an expression 
  that we did it! d0h@! why would we kill our own people (we arn't dumb as you) 
  you did a masacre of 30 innocent sicks and blamed it on us, and now again this 
  MASS massacre is being blamed on pakistan. welp, fuck off, oh and fuck off's 
  to UN for sitting on their FAT asses and doing nothing, I think it's about time 
  UN and US (bleh, you just intervene where you seek interest, this is the time 
  to prove if you 'care' at all, It's a clear human rights violation.Understand 
  it now, or Never. </P>
<P>The news about the killing is as following, <font color="#C0C0C0">Massacres 
  toll tops 100 in Kashmir: Curfew imposed in troubled areas SRINAGAR, Aug 2: 
  A series of massacres on Tuesday night and Wednesday left around one hundred 
  people dead in occupied Kashmir. Curfews were imposed on Hindu-dominated areas 
  of occupied Kashmir amid concerns of a violent backlash against Muslims. According 
  to police officials, three massacres occurred on Tuesday night in the southern 
  region of held Kashmir, claiming 64 lives, while a further 29 people had been 
  killed in five smaller attacks. All but 11 of the victims were Hindu civilians, 
  police said. In the worst incident, 33 people, mainly Hindu pilgrims, were gunned 
  down on Tuesday in Pahalgam, some 100kms south of Srinagar. Two of the gunmen 
  were also killed. The massacre was followed by another just after midnight, 
  when masked gunmen descended on a small brick-making community, near the town 
  of Anantnag, and shot dead 19 migrant Hindu labourers. In the third major incident, 
  12 Hindus were shot dead in an attack on Pogal Paristan village in the district 
  of Doda. More than 60 people were injured in the attacks, some critically. The 
  indefinite curfew was imposed in several areas, including Pahalgam and occupied 
  Jammu. "The curfew was a precautionary measure as thousands of pilgrims are 
  stranded in Jammu and there is every possibility of a Hindu backlash," said 
  a police official. No groups have yet claimed responsibility for the killings 
  which came a week after the Hizbul Mujahideen announced a three-month, unilateral 
  ceasefire, prompting the Indian government to offer formal peace talks. Hizbul 
  spokesman Saleem Hashmi said delays by New Delhi in pushing forward the peace 
  process had played a part in the massacres. "They have not positively responded 
  to our truce so how can they blame others for derailing peace?" Hashmi said, 
  warning that India's attitude was jeopardizing the ceasefire. Chief Minister 
  Farooq Abdullah condemned the massacres and insisted the ceasefire would hold 
  firm. "These killings were a clear attempt to sabotage the peace process. However, 
  the peace process will continue," Abdullah said. Following the Pahalgam massacre, 
  the seasonal Hindu pilgrimage to the Armanath cave was temporarily halted by 
  the authorities, but Arun Kumar Gupta, one of 10,000 stranded pilgrims, said 
  he would not be deterred by the violence. Survivors of the massacre near Anantnag 
  said four gunmen had knocked on the door of the labourers' dormitory a little 
  after midnight. "They said their truck was stuck, and asked the men to come 
  out and help," said Shankar, who was recovering in the main Srinagar hospital 
  after being injured in the attack. "When we came out, they started counting 
  heads and then opened fire without any warning," Shankar said.</font></P>
