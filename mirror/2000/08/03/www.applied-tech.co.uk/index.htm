Hmm, maybe that statement was a bit ambitious guys. A bit of an exaggeration, no? Perhaps you forget to secure all of your clients
systems, hmmm? Or is it only your own?<br><br>

Never mind, just have a look at <b>c:\explain.txt</b> for a detailed account of the problem and the solutions.

Topical soapbox rant...hmm...lemme see... ah, good one! Bloody British government, tracking its populace by homing in on mobile phone
signals. Now, just after the furor about the RIP bill, you'd think they'd keep quiet for a while about privacy issues, but no...to add
insult to injury, the next generation of mobile phones <i>will have tracking capabilties built in as standard</i>. So, the next time you're
walking down the street talking to a mate, just think "Big Brother is watching me".<br><br>

The real question is, "Which groups, agencies and people will have the authority to utilize this technology?" I'd like to
see an open statement from the Government - given at a press conference - regarding their policies on this issue. We, the public, have a
right to know who has the ability to track our every movement. We also have the right to know if this information is logged for future
retrieval.<br><br>

You see, rules made <i>now</i> about who has the abililty and authority to monitor our movements do not predicate who will have the ability
to do so in 5 or ten years time. The thing that concerns me most is that very fact: technologies are being introduced that have the
ultimate ability to monitor the population on a mass scale, without a thought as to who will control these technologies in the future. Can
you imagine Hitler, Pole Pot, or Slobodan Milosovich with access to such technology?  The implications are very scary.<br><br>

So people - <b>make some noise</b>. Lets have this out in the open. I mean, I don't actually object to this technology being used; I'd just
like to be informed who will have access to it. You should be interested too, because it will affect your children, their children.... and so on.<br><br>

Thankyou for listening.<br><br>
