Interesting ports on www.so.cc.va.us (164.106.225.223):
Port       State       Service
80/tcp     open        http                    

TCP Sequence Prediction: Class=trivial time dependency
                         Difficulty=6 (Trivial joke)
Remote operating system guess: Windows NT4 / Win95 / Win98
