<font size=3><tt>Alright, here is my rant and props.  First of all to herbless, you are one of the more respectable people I have seen in a while, and I wish to thank you for the motivation.  The second is to the G Force Pakistan, you guys are cool in my book so mass props to you guys too.  I am not here to bitch at anyone, I just wanted to let you guys know that there is no reason we should all be talking shit just because one thinks the other is lame because they don't know this or that.  My point is it doesn't matter how you do it, you know more than everyone else and you are letting the populace know that the Internet at large is not a secure place.  People these days have a false sense of security because their IT people say "Oh no thats not us, we have the best 'this or that'."  We should be smashing the illusion of "Security" on the internet, and showing them why as well.  End of rant and props
