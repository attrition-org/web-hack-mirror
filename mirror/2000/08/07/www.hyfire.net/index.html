<p>Hacked by parag0n and w4x
<br>ph33r-the-b33r 0wnz you</center>

<p>Nothing was harmed...except maybe the pride of the ingenious admin of
this server.&nbsp; They did do a decent job; better than most.&nbsp; Contrary
to popular belief, when real hackers (such as us) hack something, they
do not erase all the files and cause irrevokable damage that costs billions
to repair.&nbsp; Don't say it cost you anything to patch the hole either.&nbsp;
That's your job.&nbsp; We're not illegally gaining access to your box either.&nbsp;
If we could get into it, it must have been made accessible to the public.&nbsp;
;]
<p>Actually, there was only a <a href="index.bak.html">default html</a>
file here from the hosting company.&nbsp; Just delete this file, rename
index.bak.html to index.html, patch the hole, and its all fixed.
<center>
<p><font size=+1>The use of anthropomorphic terminoligy when writing on
index.html files is symbolic of ereetness.</font></center>

<p>Shit parag0n has to say to people:
<p>Admin: You have weak security.&nbsp; Visit security sites and learn
how to secure yer boxen.&nbsp; We know it's hard to stay up to date.&nbsp;
Just try a little harder. =]
<br>p4ntera:&nbsp; Dude, I got mad respect for you, but you should NOT
go defacing and tell the F.B.I. to come hunt us down.&nbsp; That's just
not cool.&nbsp; Mad respect tho ;]
<br>emmy: I love you sweetie.
<br>Di]v[pLeS: Even though you hate me, I will always love you.
<br>[JcMd]: I'll get my microphone working soon!&nbsp; &lt;3
<br>Pat:&nbsp; mmmmhmmm... I won't write anything I wouldn't want your
boyfriend seeing&nbsp;&nbsp; ;]
<br>Thoreau: Welcome back.&nbsp; Glad your shit is up again.

<br>MuNkEy:&nbsp; I hope I can teach you as much as you are willing to
learn.&nbsp; Stay cool man.
<br>r00tr: Your trojan.c actually took you 5 minutes to code?&nbsp; How
long did it take to debug it?&nbsp;&nbsp; =P
<br>Marik: Um.. I'd root you, but you don't know how to install a *nix
OS.
<br>DJF1010:&nbsp; Emailing abuse@whatever.com and getting a site taken
down does NOT mean you hacked it.
<br>Sephiroth: Um, go back into #prowrestling and tell the rest of your
homo degeneration x friends to "suck it."
<br>cyberarmy.com and r00tabega.com: Thank you so much for creating the
script kiddies of today.&nbsp; You really did a great job making the word
hacker a "bad thing."
<p>Can you say 0wned?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; Let us help you: oh-nd
