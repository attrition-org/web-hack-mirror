        Welcome to our second issue of Computer Safari. Greetings to our
        customers, students, and anybody else who does not know us yet. We are
        the geeks that will happily show you the way, whenever you are lost. In
        order to make you happy and get you to join our geek kingdom we are
        offering a bunch of cool classes that will benefit you greatly. One of
        them is the Robotics class. After attending this class you will have a
        little Robot at your service that will do everything that you wish,
        including dishes and laundry. Not quite. Apologies for any possible
        disappointment. Attendance in this class will instead offer you skills
        applicable to today&#146;s real world needs. You will be closer to
        understanding logic, mechanics, electronics, and computer control</font></td>
      <td width="23%" valign="top" rowspan="4" height="171"><font face="Arial" size="2">Through
        use of wireless data transfers, light and touch sensors you can command
        the robots to move within their surroundings. You will be building these
        little machines in teams of 6 people. Soon after you will be able to
        compete with other teams and see whose robot lasts the longest in a
        one-on-one robot survival of the fittest. If you thing that this sounds
        cool, and you would like to have a friendly robot by your side, let us
        know and we will make it happen.</font></center><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>

      </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2">For those of
      you that do not like robots much (how come?) and instead you would like to
      build computers, we are offering &quot;How to build a PC&quot; class. From
      megabytes to mother boards you will be able to learn the ins and outs of
      today's powerful personal computers. This class will give you</font></td>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I have
        recently started teaching at the site, I see much potential in Kira. She
        likes to explain what she does as she works and is not afraid to help
        her friends if they are in need of assistance. She is quite familiar
        with the various software that we are using and quickly picks up new
        concepts as they are being introduced to her. In addition, Kira is
        developing skills that will be invaluable to her in the future.
        Congratulations, Kira! Keep up the great work!</font>

        &nbsp;&nbsp; I chose Isaiah for the
        Student of the Month award because of his wonderful enthusiasm for
        computer class. Whenever we meet in the hallway, he is beaming from ear
        to ear because he is coming to Computer Safari. He has been an avid
        learner on the computer. I especially enjoy watching him with a new
        program. He is full of curiosity and truly delights in learning new
        things.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is very friendly to
        our teachers and the other students. I also appreciate his ability to
        share and work with a partner. Isaah is a wonderful student and I have
        thoroughly enjoyed having him in our class. Good job, Isaah!</font>

        identify different animals and their habitants. Not only is Trevor&#146;s
        knowledge growing in the thematic units but also in computers. Trevor is
        able to successfully use both a mouse and a touch pad to manipulate the
        mouser on the screen. Trevor has also proven to be an excellent student
        willing to learn and try anything that is set before him. Trevor has
        also been an excellent teacher in our class by giving pointers to the
        younger students in the class. Trevor Kaaihue is truly an inspiration to

        Creative Writer 2 is an excellent program to create banners, posters,
        cards, newsletters, and other projects. This software includes an
        extensive variety of graphics and sounds, as well as special effects
        which allow you to add sound and movement to graphic or typing.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who are having trouble starting a
        project, Creative Writer 2 has project ideas, which are templates for
        projects. During January and February Computer Safari students have been
        exploring Creative Writer, creating an array of projects. Elementary
        students have made family newsletters for the New Year, which included
        their resolutions and goals for this year 2000. Our latest project was a
        poem writing activity where students were to complete a poem written by
        Shel Silverstein.</font></p>

        Q. Should I leave my computer on or off when I am
        not using it?</font>
        
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(by Jason -The Young Geek)<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you only use your computer for about one
          hour a day, you should turn it off and leave it as such until you need
          to use it again. Since the computer is running at a constant
          temperature and voltage, this will make its components last longer.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you visit your computer often (say, 10 minutes
        intervals) you should leave it on and power it down at night. However
        your computer will not be hurt by leaving it on all night. Microsoft
        Windows has a program that automatically switches your hard drive into a
        low power mode after 30 minutes of inactivity, which does not use much
        electricity.</font></p>
        
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it is healthier for your computer, if you are
        using it constantly, to leave it on all day or overnight.</font></p>
