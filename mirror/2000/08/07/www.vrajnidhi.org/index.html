</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#c0c0c0"><P>Kashmir is an area on the northern borders of India and Pakistan; officially known as Jammu &amp; Kashmir.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#c0c0c0"><P>Kashmir is famous for its natural beauty and has often been referred to as the 'Switzerland of the East'. The heart of the area is the fertile Vale of Kashmir (known as The Valley), which lies between the Himalayas and the Pir Panjal mountain range. Here the climate is mild and the soil well watered.</P>
<P>Kashmir covers an area of 222,237 SqKm (85,800 SqMi). Mount Godwin Austen/K2 (8,611m/28,250 ft) and mount Nanga Parbat (8,123m/26,650 ft) lie in Northern Kashmir.</P>

Others are engaged in small industries making shawls, rugs and carpets. Kashmir is well known for its wool and, in particular, its shawls and carpets.</P>

As a result of a rebellion in 1947 and the subsequent wars between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, the area is separated by a Line-of-Control (LOC or cease-fire line). To the east of the LOC lies the vale of Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh which are</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2> administered by India.
