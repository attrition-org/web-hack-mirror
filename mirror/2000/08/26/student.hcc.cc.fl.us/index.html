Multiple domains were hit with the same web page defacement.

Domains:
student.hcc.cc.fl.us
iis.dotfoods.com
tek.aats.dk
w3.sira.it
www.casablito.net
 
 
Please note that not all these defacements were identical; however, they are
so close and so numerous, and so clearly made with MSADC, that for sanity's
sake we're lumping them together.  As is stated on <a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/notes.html">
http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/notes.html</a>, "Changing one line on 10
domains is not a mass hack.  WE determine what is considered a mass hack and
what is not."
