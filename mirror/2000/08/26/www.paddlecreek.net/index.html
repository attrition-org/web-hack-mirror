Multiple domains were hit with the same web page defacement.

Domains:
www.paddlecreek.net
www.atlantida.agava.ru
support.warpedsystems.sk.ca
www.northiowaonline.com
www.abamedia.de
www.longhofer.com
icedream.free.fr
www.freshmeat.de
captainmeat.utstation.de
       

While these defacements were not identical, they were all PHP-nuke defacements
of message boards, and so numerous that for sanity's sake we have lumped them
together as one.  As is stated on <a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/notes.html">
http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/notes.html</a>, "Changing one line on
10 domains is not a mass hack.  WE determine what is considered a mass hack and
what is not."
