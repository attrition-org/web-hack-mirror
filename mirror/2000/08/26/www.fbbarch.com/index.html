<b><u>title: the judgemental slapnut</u></b>
<br>
<.yaygrey>    i've seen some of your defacements, the little euphamisms are rather amusing and your graphics have potential, but otherwise i think your just a lame piece of shit.<br>
<br>
<.obz_123>    oh ya why's that? i was just thinking maybe we could be friends...<br>
<br>
<.yaygrey>    well, for one you deface nt, how pathetic is that???<br>
<br>
<.obz_123>    well hell ya i deface nt, besides how else would you be able to pull off your *nix hax's of your's without people like me pursuading people to move more and more to *nix to leave all those wonderful defaults open for you to feed upon...?<br>
<br>
<.obz_123>    beside's wtf should you care? a minute ago you just bitched for like 5 minutes about how you want there to be no more windows and *nix the dominant os's. then try to slander me for contributing to that movement? whats up with that?<br>
<br>
<.yaygrey>    ya whatever fucknut, its not like you have any original sploits of your own... huh cockmonger?<br>
<br>
<.obz_123>    actually i have a few here an there, just on private inhouse software for now though, but for those systems i've do have cherry poppers for they do more or less get full control of whatever it is and by most would be counted as plausible exploits, thats what i do fewl. but oh well, nothing to be super proud of but it's not like i'm going to STOP learning...<br>
<br>
<.obz_123>    don't worry though i look forward to the mainstream, which is why i've published a few articles already, but true, i'm not pullin the k-rad o.dayz i would like to be, but learning takes time doesnt it? wait till i actually have some decent skillz, then you can have something to actually be mad about...<br>
<br>
<.yaygrey>    yer full of shit, you know you probably dont even code... shit you prolly cant even script out some html<br>
<br>
<.obz_123>    actually no.. i script one click and realbasic on the mac, and on the pc i do or did qbasic, vb6, html, some javascript, lasso, and i'm currently on perl.<br>
<br>
<.obz_123>    ya ya ya and i know, i dont know shit about c.c++ but all in due time... as alot of people i plan on shoving lots of knowledge in this head, but like few i WILL succeed.<br>
<br>
<.yaygrey>    ok, then name some functions i might use for fetching network information with perl?<br>
<br>
<.obz_123>    what the hell is that supposed to mean?<br>

<br>
<.obz_123>    getprotobyname, getprotobynumber, getservbyport ummm...<br>
<br>
<.yaygrey>    ok so you know a few functions, your still a dumbass!<br>
<br>
<.obz_123>    maybe so, but atleast i have the ambition of rising above my curse of being a dumbass, where as you will be left to be a pathetic donkey fucking hillbilly for the rest of your impotent life you pillow biting butt pirate...<br>
<br>
<.yaygrey>    kiss my ass pussy, you know you have to take your sheit to compusa to reload yer windows lol.<br>

fuckzyouz to: AcideBladez/Neon-lenz, for one, if you know nothing more than /msadc you don't have the right to bitch about how weak a sites security is as if to glamorize yourself and show the admin to be inferior to your elitile hacking skills, cut it out, no ones impressed... if anything, call it 'tagging' seeing as how theres <u>no</u> skill required.<br>
<hr>
admin: nothing harmed in anyway, just bringing your attention to a flaw which allowed me to deface your website, so dont worry, be happy i'm not a <u>complete</u> asshole...     ;oD
