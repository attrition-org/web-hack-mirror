<P>New Delhi begins talks with Hizb nominee: 30 killed in Kashmir Monitoring Desk KARACHI, Aug 1: The process of talks </P>
<P>between New Delhi and the Hizbul Mujahideen was set in motion on Tuesday as Indian home ministry officials contacted the </P>
<P>outfit's nominee for negotiations here. Fazal Haq Qureshi, a veteran freedom struggle leader heading the Jammu and Kashmir </P>
<P>People's Political Front, nominated as the negotiator by Hizbul Mujahideen, confirmed that officials of the home ministry spoke to </P>
<P>him on phone on Tuesday morning. However, Qureshi refused to divulge details of his interaction with the officials but said: "I told </P>
<P>them that I am available for anybody," according to a PTI report monitored here. He said he was waiting for "guidelines" from the </P>
<P>Hizbul Mujahideen to go ahead with the talks with New Delhi. Qureshi said he had been in touch with the Hizbul Mujahideen </P>
<P>prior to its announcement of unilateral ceasefire for three months. "I am in touch with the Hizbul Mujahideen as before. Even </P>
<P>before they (Hizb) announced the ceasefire, I was in contact with them". APPEAL: The Hizbul Mujahideen appealed on Tuesday </P>
<P>to other groups to lay down their weapons and urged Indian forces to suspend operations in occupied Kashmir, says an AFP </P>
<P>report from Srinagar. In its statement, the Hizbul Mujahideen said: "We appeal to other groups to support the ceasefire and we </P>
<P>expect the Indian troops to suspend their offensive operations against all the groups." The statement said authorities had been </P>
<P>asked to contact a leader, Fazal-Haq Qureshi. BREAKTHROUGH: The sudden and unprecedented truce between India and the </P>
<P>Hizbul Mujahideen has kindled a flicker of hope for peace in occupied Kashmir. Some believe the developments that have </P>
<P>unfolded so rapidly in recent weeks could culminate in a meeting between Chief Executive Gen Pervez Musharraf and Indian </P>
<P>Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee at the UN Assembly next month. That would indeed be a breakthrough given that since last </P>
<P>year's undeclared war in Kargil, New Delhi has refused to hold talks with Islamabad. But analysts say such hope could easily be </P>
<P>snuffed out by New Delhi's reluctance to include Islamabad in negotiations on Kashmir, and its unwillingness to make concessions </P>
<P>on sovereignty. There could also be an escalation of violence as diehard groups - such as Lashkar-i-Taiba and Jaish-i-</P>
<P>Mohammad - try to undermine the unilateral ceasefire implemented by the Hizbul Mujahideen last week. The first evidence came </P>
<P>quickly, with the Lashkar-i-Taiba launching a fierce attack on an Indian army camp in occupied Kashmir on Sunday night. </P>
<P>CURFEW: Meanwhile, an indefinite curfew was imposed on Tuesday in a district of occupied Kashmir after the killing of 23 </P>
<P>people, including five Hindu pilgrims at a crowded marketplace, a police official said. The official said a group of unidentified </P>
<P>gunmen swooped on a market in Pahalgam, 97kms south of Srinagar, and fired indiscriminately at shoppers. "The Pahalgam </P>
<P>market which was targeted lies on the Hindu pilgrimage route to the holy Amarnath cave in southern Kashmir. That is why the </P>
<P>dead and the injured are mainly from the Hindu community," said the official. "This incident could spark off a lot of communal </P>
<P>violence. That is why we have cordoned off the area and stepped up security." A team, led by a senior police officer, rushed to </P>
<P>the spot as people from the Hindu community thronged the streets shouting anti-Muslim and anti-government slogans outside </P>
<P>police stations, hospitals and government buildings. The district administration imposed an indefinite curfew with police and </P>
<P>paramilitary soldiers fanning out across the area after a mob indulged in heavy stone-pelting, damaging government property. "The </P>
<P>police have acted promptly and resorted to baton charges and firing to scare away the mobs," the official said. The situation was </P>
<P>"calm", he said, but admitted to an "undercurrent of tension" in the southern district where Pahalgam is located. In a separate </P>
<P>incident, Indian soldiers shot dead a freedom fighter after he threw two grenades at a government registration office in occupied </P>
<P>Jammu, police said. "Police challenged four suspicious-looking men lurking around a government registration office. One of them </P>
<P>threw two grenades in the direction of the office when the police shot him dead," said a police official. "Three of the rebels then </P>
<P>dashed off in the direction of a crowded nearby residential colony in Jammu called Gujjar Nagar. The police were unable to </P>
<P>apprehend them despite firing several rounds," the official said. A number of Hindu pilgrims were standing outside the government </P>
<P>office waiting to get their travel permits at the time of the incident. Police say the Hindu pilgrims may have been a possible target. </P>
<P>Police added that two freedom fighters were also killed on Tuesday in an encounter with the Indian army in a forest near </P>
