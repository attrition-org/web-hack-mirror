<p>OMFG! Did you make a d0od0o? heh. Dear admin, your security is very weak.
A university is supposed to educate, not let others educate you. However,
I'm not here to criticize. Just to prove that even universities aren't as
intelligent as the average juggalo. d0od0o krew gotz mad love. Well. d0od0o 
krew isn't here to terrorize. We are here to secure an imperfect world free of charge.<br><br><br>
Some other things we'd like to address: </p>

<b>ph33r-the-scriptkids</b>: Listen...<br>
We aren't here to fight with you. Don't give our members shit because you're
just wasting your own breath. Anyone can ./wu2600 a website, so please don't
call it a skill. Some members of ph33r are cool with us, and i don't intend
to start a cyber-scriptkid gangland war or whatever the fuck you call it, i
just want to let you know that we've been over this before. I mean, since
when was it cool to look on HNN and say "hey! i saw that GrEwP deface a site,
and i think i will tell them to suck my left nugget so i can be noticed by the public."
This shit is getting old. Learn to respect others, and eventually they'll return
the favor. Enough said. <br></p>
