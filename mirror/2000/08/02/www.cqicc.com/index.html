		This one's for you p4ntera... Ok, so it's not a *nix, but listen - don't be so quick to wish death on someone. Thats not in the
		hacker-orientated, freedom-of-speech, tree-hugging spirit. I hope you live long and prosper :) Lets bring the groups and lone-hackers
		together in a united front and show anyone who's reading that we are above dumb name-calling, and are capable of unity as well as
		breaking into computer systems. To hell with a distributed nmap, lets have a distributed hacker group.<br><br>
		
		Ph33r the H3rb ;-)<br>
