Please note that this defacement links to a domains.txt page which claims
a large number of defacements -- more than we have listed here.  Attrition
staff noticed a discrepancy and went through to verify each page through
the first hundred pages listed.  Of those hundred claimed sites, only these
twenty-one were actually defaced; the others were either not defaced or not
reachable by Attrition staff.  We did not, therefore, list all the sites
the defacer claimed; rather, we listed only those we were able to verify
ourselves.
