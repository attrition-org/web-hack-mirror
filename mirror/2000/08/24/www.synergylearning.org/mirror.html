        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size=2>As much as We would like to talk 
          about Pakistan's right to having Kashmir as it's province We won't. 
          We are beyond that now. We don't really care who gets Kashmir; All we 
          want is to stop the violence in Kashmir. Innocent people are killed 
          daily by Indian soldiers simply because of what these people they believe 
          in. The Kashmir's support Pakistan despite the option of independence, 
          yet the international community (as a whole) does not do&nbsp; anything 
          about it, and pretends it's not happening. (If you don't believe us, 
          then go do a UN supervised survey, 80% of the people in Kashmir will 
          vote for Pakistan, the other 20% are Indian soldiers). Let us assure 
          you, people are dying in Kashmir as you read this. They have been dying 
          for the last 50 years and no one has done anything about it. India claims 
          it's Pakistani troops that it is so efficiently killing. oh really? 
          That's news to me. Since when did women and children and&nbsp; handicapped 
          people join the Pakistan army? Since when did the rape of innocent women 
          and children become an "effective method of stopping terrorists"?&nbsp;</font><font size=2>We 
          are sick of this. We want the Indians to back off. I'll be damned if 
          they do, but nonetheless, we want you people to know exactly what's 
          going on and HAS&nbsp;been going on in Kashmir for the last 50 years. 
          While you people sit in your comfortable homes/offices with computer, 
          electricity, food, water, and most important of all; freedom,&nbsp; 
          eighteen people are brutally murdered in Kashmir by Indian soldiers 
          DAILY, and that's a&nbsp;highly rough estimate as another three hundred 
          or so people go 'missing' every day. And for what? Simply because they 
          want to believe in whatever they want. They want to be able to live 
          without fear of being killed, without worrying about&nbsp;&nbsp; where 
          to get their next meal, and where to run when the Indian soldiers come.&nbsp;</font><font size="2">What 
          are we getting throgh this? Is this what 21st century is? Killing? Rape? 
          Totutre? by those Indian bastards openly?</font> UN it's about time 
          for them to intervence, this fight has been going on for 50+ years.</p>
        <P><font color="#FFFFFF">Unjustified Killings?</font> 
        <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Since 1989, an estimated 40,000 Kashmiris 
          have been killed by the Indian forces stationed in Kashmir. For the 
          last five years the people of the State have intensified their efforts 
          in order to invite the attention of the world community towards the 
          "Kashmir Dispute", though the people of the State had been fighting 
          for their just cause peacefully for the last forty eight years. Indian 
          Government throughout these four decades has been suppressing the people 
          by illegal use of force, putting them into the jails/ Interrogation 
          centres etc. under draconian laws. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Whenever any person demanded holding 
          of " Plebiscite", he has been put behind the bars. The Indian Forces, 
          stationed in Kashmir, have been given a free hand to kill any person 
          they choose. These powers have been given to them under the draconian 
          laws like "Disturbed Areas Act of 1990" and "Indian Armed Forces Act 
          of 1990". Indifference shown by world community to the miseries of people, 
          have encouraged and given a free hand to armed forces, to deal with 
          the people, as they like. In October 1992, the Indian Armed forces started 
          to intensify the killing of people immediately after their arrest. These 
          operations have been carried out under the code name of "Operation Tiger", 
          "Operation Eagle" and "Operation Shiva".</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> Now the armed forces have resorted 
          to another policy of "Catch and Kill" which means that no sooner a person 
          is taken into custody, within minutes he is brutally tortured and killed 
          . The dead body is then thrown into the street. In other cases, innocent 
          civilians are arrested and taken to border areas where they are shot. 
          The Indian government then publicises that these people were militants 
          killed in armed encounters with the troops. It is common practice for 
          the paramilitary forces to walk into a quiet village/town and start 
          shooting indiscriminately, killing innocent and unarmed civilians - 
          all under the pretence of crack-down operations against the Freedom-Fighters. 
          In most cases, innocent civilians are killed, women gang-raped and properties 
          set on fire. Below is a brief catalogue of the unjustified killings 
          by the Indian troops in Kashmir. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This catalogue is by no means complete 
          as thousands of killings go un-noticed and undocumented. The list given 
          below was compiled painstakingly by various Kashmiri Human-rights activists, 
          with great risks to their personal lives. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><em><font size="2">Due to these excesses, more 
          than 50,000 Kashmiris have been killed since 1990, with a lot more unaccounted 
          for. Thousands of helpless Muslim Kashmiris have fled across the Line-of-Control 
          to Azad Kashmir and are now living in refugee camps. The Hindu Pandit 
          population has not been immune to the recent unrest either. They have 
          also fled the valley in their thousands and are now living in refugee 
          camps in Jammu and India. </font> </em></font></p>

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><em><font size="2">Please note, we are not a 
          racist group, if you read all our stuff, you must realise our anger. 
          We see people killed everyday, women raped, thick blood lying around, 
          orphan children crying, and on the other hand, zee media (Indians) blame 
          Pakistan for massacres and try to give a impression that Pakistan is 
          responsible for the whole Kashmir issue,and we are responsible for every 
          violence in Kahsmir. We like to apologise to any one that was offended 
          by our defacement, even if it's a Indian. </font></em></font></p>
