<br>Hackweiser has hit your system.

<p>Sorry for the inconvience, you are a innocent pawn in this chess game

known as "cyberspace"

<br>Oh I would like to get some things across.

<br> Admin: index is backed up, sploit is patched.

<br>p4ntera != ch3wb4k4

<br>p4ntera != b33rcan

<br>In fact, to add to that, p4ntera has quit defacing (and for some time

now), so stop badgering him while he is trying to enjoy his life.

<p>bl4f, I suggest you stop harassing other hackers. That's including us.

We don't know you, and don't wanna know you. You are just looking for
quick

fame and glory amongst your irc.2600.net friends by bothering others. Shut

up or pay the price.

<p>How did I hack this? Hackweiser has coders (very good ones at that)

and we use our own exploit code (exceptions for some).

<br>Admin: I backed up your index, but seeing as there is not a patch for

this exploit, I could not do so. Very sorry.

<p>Shouts (in no pacticular order): gu1n3ss, my man ch3wb4k4, anyone else

in hackweiser, gH and mosthated and anyone else who supports us.<br>

<BR>

<br>We are looking for scene wh0res (heh) that have the skill and
motivation

to push us forward.</center>
