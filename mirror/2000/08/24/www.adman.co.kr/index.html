The hypocracy stops here
The United States government seems to think they control the world.</P>
And while I am a vigilant supporter of their good deeds and attemps at
peace</P>
I draw the line when they try to take our freedom.
You see... This is my world and my life. This is the internet, a true
democracy in itself. a spread network of tightly
bound factions.
It is my inspiration, and it is my motivation.
I believe I speak for most 'hackers' when I say the following:</P>
PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH
The world seems to be experiencing an unparalleled unity through this
network
hackers are the pionners of this place, we are the only ones with the
intelligence,
the motivation, and the skill to head up this complex world. You need us,
yet you try to destroy us.
You hate us, why? you persecute us, why? 
Are you afraid of what you dont understand and too dumb to learn?
You wonder why you are under attack?
The bee lets you have its honey, but strike its hive and what do you get?

isnt it true? the NSA and FBI aren't GOOD enough to track us hackers down,
so they have to cheat. of course there isn't really cheating in war now is
there? nah. and this is a war. fbi, nsa, vs hackers. fbi is a joke, they
can't catch hackers.. not even little rds kiddies (/msadcs.dll
jackass's). its time for us to spy on you. government and military sites
will be owned. data will be stolen, holes will not be patched =]. bye.
