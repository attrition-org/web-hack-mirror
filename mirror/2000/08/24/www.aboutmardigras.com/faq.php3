</td>

<td bgcolor=ffffff>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif, Charcoal, Chicago, sans-serif" size="3"><b>What is it and what does it do?</b>
<p><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">About Mardi Gras is a service where people can find information about Mardi Gras and New Orleans.  Users can post stories, advice about where to go and what to see, and ask questions.  You can find out what other people are saying about all things MG, find out the best place to stay, eat, and where they had sex outside without getting caught!

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif, Charcoal, Chicago, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Who's behind all of this?</b>
<p><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">AboutMardiGras.com is a free service provided by <a href="http://MardiGrasZone.com">Mardi Gras Zone</a> (a leading supplier of Mardi Gras merchandise). AboutMardiGras.com is the fastest growing website of it's kind. We think of it as the Slashdot of Mardi Gras websites. Feel free to post your own article on any Mardi Gras related subject, but we reserve the right to delete anything we consider harmful.  

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif, Charcoal, Chicago, sans-serif" size="3"><b>I submitted a story, but I don't see it in the list.  What's going on?</b>
<p><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">We read all story submissions before they are displayed.  This is so people don't post things that are defamatory, completely guttermouthed, make no sense, or have already been posted by someone else.  If there are any typographic errors, the story is rejected.  Just kidding.  Just check back later, and it should come up.  If you're story isn't up the next day, ask yourself why that might have been before you go whining to webmaster@aboutmardigras.com.

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif, Charcoal, Chicago, sans-serif" size="3"><b>What is the difference between a story and a comment?</b>
<p><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">A story begins a topic of conversation, and is shown on the front page.     These are submitted and our editorial staff has a look at them before they are shown on the site.<br>
Comments are just that, comments that relate to a particular story, and are shown on the page for that story.  Anyone can post a comment, and they don't have to be approved to be posted, nor do you have an account to post a comment.  However, we reserve the right to delete any comments that are judged to be harmful content.

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif, Charcoal, Chicago, sans-serif" size="3"><b>How can I format what I post?</b>
<p><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">If you know HTML you can format what you post, but we only allow the following HTML tags:<br> &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;a&gt; &lt;em&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;tt&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;ul&gt;<br>
This is so you can't post pictures, make people fill out forms that get sent who knows where, and to keep it simple.<br>
If you don't understand HTML, then choose Plain Old Text when submitting your masterpiece if you want it to be readable.  HTML ignores when you hit the Enter key, so everything will run together.  Use the preview button to see what your post will look like before you actually post it.



<p><font face="MS Sans Serif, Charcoal, Chicago, sans-serif" size="3"><b>What does score:0,1,2,3... mean?</b>
<p><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">We let moderators (maybe you someday) who have logged in vote on the submissions.  For instance, someone tells a great story or shares some useful information, moderators will likely give this a good score.  Comments can be moderated down also, so keep this in mind.  Think, then post.<br>
When reading these threads, there are a number of display options that these scores get used for.  You can display the highest scores first, and you can elect to not read comments that are below a certain score.<br>
We're in the process of making a policy so that users can moderate.  Moderation will be a peer-review system.  Don't get upset when your great story about a girl with an Adam's apple doesn't receive a good score.<br>
Note that when you post a comment while logged in, you start with a score of 1, while if you post anonymously, you start with a score of zero.

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif, Charcoal, Chicago, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Why do I need to login?</b>
<p><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">You don't, unless you want to submit a story.  You can participate in the forum anonymously, but if you want your name to be something other than MardiGrasRules!, you should <a href="http://aboutmardigras.com/user.php3">create an account</a>.  If you think you'll be using the sevice more than once (most people do), an account is a good thing.

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif, Charcoal, Chicago, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Do I need to use my real email address?</b>
<p><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Yes and no.  When you enter your personal information, you are asked for a both a real and a fake email address.  The real one should be real, this is the address that your password is sent to!  The fake one can be fake or real, it's the address that will be seen publicly on any comments or articles that you post.

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif, Charcoal, Chicago, sans-serif" size="3"><b>What do you use cookies for?  Do I need to enable them?</b>
<p><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">We use cookies to remember who you are, so you don't have to login each time you visit.  Also any preferences you may have entered into the system are remembered with cookies.  This is for your convenience, so if you want to disable cookies that's fine with us, but things may not appear as you want them to.  See <a href="http://aboutmardigras.com/cookies.php3">About Cookies</a> for more details.  

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif, Charcoal, Chicago, sans-serif" size="3"><b>What's your privacy policy?</b>
<p><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">All your personal information you give us is kept private, and will stay that way.  Relax and enjoy.

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif, Charcoal, Chicago, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Where's all the pictures of girls baring their naked breasts?</b>
<p><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Not here, friend, you can't submit any pictures to this site.  You can submit links to a site with pictures, however, if you wish, and we expect to have a webcam of a French Quarter location sometime closer to Mardi Gras, which may have pictures of, well, just about anything!

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif, Charcoal, Chicago, sans-serif" size="3"><b>I've got a great idea for a poll.  How do I post it?</b>
<p><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Send it to <a href="mailto:greatideaforapoll@aboutmardigras.com">greatideaforapoll@aboutmardigras.com</a>.  If it's great, we'll use it.

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif, Charcoal, Chicago, sans-serif" size="3"><b>My friends peed on a police car, how do I get them out of jail?</b>
<p><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The Orleans Parish Criminal District Court is located at 2700 Tulane Ave, the phone number for the answer desk is (504) 827-3425.  You may also need to talk to the Bond Department at (504) 827-3544.  Best of luck.<br><br>
