Well, I dunno about you but I am certainly not willing to trust public accountants who can't even keep their website secure.  Hey admin, you need to get security, bad.  I didn't delete anything, I just renamed the old website index.old.  So, just change that and  you should be good to go again.

Well,  I guess this time I will protest the hording of knowledge.  So what if millions of script kiddies (me included) do bad stuff from time to time.  Just because someone knows how to edit the kernel of a linux box or program in C doesn't make you any better than the next guy.  So get over I am leeter than though attitude and pass on some of that information.   ....end of rant
