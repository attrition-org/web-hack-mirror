          are?</font></i></b></P>
        <p><font size="2">The Kashmiri people claim that the occupation of Kashmir 
          by India is illegal. They do not want to be part of India nor do they 
          want any Indian presence on their soil. The provisions of the Instrument 
          of Accession, if genuine, stipulated that the accession to India was 
          to be ratified by a plebiscite.</font><font size="2">Since 1947, India 
          has occupied Kashmir and has stalled, by whatever means at her disposal, 
          the progress towards the holding of a plebiscite - the original and 
          the most universally accepted solution. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">"There is no doubt that had a referendum had been held 
          in Kashmir, the vast majority of Kashmiris would have voted to join 
          Pakistan. Such a a referendum, in the form of a plebiscite, was promised 
          to the people of Kashmir by the Security Council in 1948. India then 
          accepted the principle of plebiscite but has since obstructed all attempts 
          at arranging one"</font><font size="2">- Kalim Siddiqui.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"> In 1957, India further violated the sovereignty of 
          Kashmir by implementing a new State Constitution which, in effect, incorporated 
          the state into the Indian Union, in face of fierce protests from the 
          Kashmiri people, Pakistan and the UN. The new Constitution was formally 
          adopted on 26th January 1957 and it declared that "the state of Jammu 
          and Kashmir is and shall be an integral part of the Union of India". 
          Since the adoption of the Constitution, India has got itself into a 
          state of affairs, which can only be described as hypocritical and aggressive.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">On the one hand, India claims that Kashmir is an integral 
          part of the Indian Union. On the other hand India has signed two agreements 
          (Tashkent 1966, Shimla 1972) with Pakistan, in which India agreed to 
          resolve the Kashmiri dispute through bilateral and peaceful means. Further, 
          India is still party to numerous UN resolutions which proclaim Kashmir 
          to be a disputed territory. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">"It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the whole 
          history of Kashmir has been of misgovernment and oppression; nor was 
          this tradition dead in this century. And the political question mark 
          still hangs over the area despite India's past political control and 
          economic effort. Leaving the legal and moral issues aside, the economic 
          disruption caused by the de facto partition along the Cease-Fire line 
          has been deplorable" - J Dupuis.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"> More recently, India has increased her role as an oppressor 
          in Kashmir. The deployment of 500,000 troops to silence the voices of 
          the Kashmiri people is seen as the only solution by the Indian government, 
          resulting in gross violations of human rights. These crimes have been 
          carried out as a matter of routine and some are well documented by the 
          various Human Rights agencies. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Please note, we are not a racist group, if you read 
          all our stuff, you must realise our anger. We see people killed everyday, 
          women raped, thick blood lying around, orphan children crying, and on 
          the other hand, zee media (Indians) blame Pakistan for massacres and 
          try to give a impression that Pakistan is responsible for the whole 
          Kashmir issue,and we are responsible for every violence in Kahsmir. 
          We like to apologise to any one that was offended by our defacement, 
          even if it's a Indian. </font></p>
