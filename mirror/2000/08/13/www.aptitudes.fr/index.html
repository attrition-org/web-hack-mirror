Looks like you got defaced...<BR>
Quite a shame really...<BR>
Your site was real nice...<BR><P><BR>
But Never <b>fear</b>...<BR>
I didnt delete your work...<BR>
Cos you probably don't have a backup<BR>
I mean, you couldnt be <b>bothered</b> to fix...<BR>
A very <b>simple</b> exploit in your server...<BR>
So i presume you have better things to do...<BR>
<P><BR>

Anyhow, enough of the rambling...<BR>
Your server is secured and your page is <a href=poltergeists/index.html> backed up</a><BR>
<P><BR>

Oops, almost forgot...<BR>
What sort of a defacement would this be...<BR>
Without some greetz...<BR><P>

ello, ello, ello to:<P><font color=blue></i><b>pr|est and all of #poltergeists@efnet<BR>
smooth, kjun, aldoril, wizard, and anyone else who <i>should</i> be here but isnt.<P>
