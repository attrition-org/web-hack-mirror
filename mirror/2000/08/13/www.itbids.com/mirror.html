        <P><i>Unjustified Killings?</i></P>
        <P><font size="2">Since 1989, an estimated 40,000 Kashmiris have been 
          killed by the Indian forces stationed in Kashmir. For the last five 
          years the people of the State have intensified their efforts in order 
          to invite the attention of the world community towards the "Kashmir 
          Dispute", though the people of the State had been fighting for their 
          just cause peacefully for the last forty eight years. Indian Government 
          throughout these four decades has been suppressing the people by illegal 
          use of force, putting them into the jails/ Interrogation centres etc. 
          under draconian laws. </font></P>
        <P><font size="2">Whenever any person demanded holding of " Plebiscite", 
          he has been put behind the bars. The Indian Forces, stationed in Kashmir, 
          have been given a free hand to kill any person they choose. These powers 
          have been given to them under the draconian laws like "Disturbed Areas 
          Act of 1990" and "Indian Armed Forces Act of 1990". Indifference shown 
          by world community to the miseries of people, have encouraged and given 
          a free hand to armed forces, to deal with the people, as they like. 
          In October 1992, the Indian Armed forces started to intensify the killing 
          of people immediately after their arrest. These operations have been 
          carried out under the code name of "Operation Tiger", "Operation Eagle" 
          and "Operation Shiva"</font><font size="2">.</font></P>
        <P><font size="2"> Now the armed forces have resorted to another policy 
          of "Catch and Kill" which means that no sooner a person is taken into 
          custody, within minutes he is brutally tortured and killed . The dead 
          body is then thrown into the street. In other cases, innocent civilians 
          are arrested and taken to border areas where they are shot. The Indian 
          government then publicises that these people were militants killed in 
          armed encounters with the troops. It is common practice for the paramilitary 
          forces to walk into a quiet village/town and start shooting indiscriminately, 
          killing innocent and unarmed civilians - all under the pretence of crack-down 
          operations against the Freedom-Fighters. In most cases, innocent civilians 
          are killed, women gang-raped and properties set on fire. Below is a 
          brief catalogue of the unjustified killings by the Indian troops in 
          Kashmir. </font></P>
        <P><font size="2">This catalogue is by no means complete as thousands 
          of killings go un-noticed and undocumented. The list given below was 
          compiled painstakingly by various Kashmiri Human-rights activists, with 
          great risks to their personal lives. </font></P>

        <P><i><font size="2">Due to these excesses, more than 50,000 Kashmiris 
          have been killed since 1990, with a lot more unaccounted for. Thousands 
          of helpless Muslim Kashmiris have fled across the Line-of-Control to 
          Azad Kashmir and are now living in refugee camps. The Hindu Pandit population 
          has not been immune to the recent unrest either. They have also fled 
          the valley in their thousands and are now living in refugee camps in 
          Jammu and India. </font> </i> </P>

        <P><font size="2">Please note, we are not a racist group, if you read 
          all our stuff, you must realise our anger. We see people killed everyday, 
          women raped, thick blood lying around, orphan children crying, and on 
          the other hand, zee media (Indians) blame Pakistan for massacres and 
          try to give a impression that Pakistan is responsible for the whole 
          Kashmir issue,and we are responsible for every violence in Kahsmir. 
          We like to apologise to any one that was offended by our defacement, 
          even if it's a Indian. </font></P>
