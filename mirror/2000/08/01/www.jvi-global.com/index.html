<p align="center">UNITE THE UNDERGROUND</p>

<p align="center">Back in the early 80's LOD, and the rest of the 'underground' controlled
more of the phone <br>
system than most of you would immagine. We had control... I want's to bring the control<br>
back to the underground. Now, in a day when we have the ability to communicate so easily, <br>
Why can't the underground Unite? Why do all the 'hackers' of the world think this is some
kind of war?<br>
We are all the same people. What used to be about knowledge, now is about popularity, and
ego.<br>
Crews of today are more like street gangs, fighting each other instead of the system,
wasteing time<br>
and slowly killing each other off. <br>
I've heard some people say they want it to be like it was in the 80's. Back when hacking
was easy.<br>
Back in the days of BBS systems and LOD. But we can't go back, and this is not about being
Nostalgic <br>
to our predeccessors, this is about becoming the next generation of the underground. It
has gotten<br>
so much harder, and so much more risky to be one of us. It will continue to do so forever.
The system<br>
I sit at now, will be obsolete, so will I and everything I know. The next generation will
talk about<br>
me as I talk about the 'oldskoolers' today. I want the next generation to remember mine as
the generation<br>
that united the underground.<br>
Someone asked me, what is 'hacking'? Well... what is hacking, it can't be described
anymore. The <br>
word has been raped over the years and now has no meaning what so ever. I don't consider
myself a hacker<br>
the original word meant to take apart a program and make it run faster. Now it has so many
meanings, that<br>
some cancel out the others. For us, hacking isn't just something we do. It's something we
are<br>
we are driven by one soul cause... Truth. Our lives revolve around the quest for it. <br>
I did not become a 'hacker' to deface webpages, to fight with other groups, or to cause
havok to <br>
networks. I am a hacker, because I want the truth. I want to know what the NSA knows. I
want to know what<br>
they are hiding. I want to know the reason for it all. When I explained this to someone
they asked. <br>
&quot;Is the NSA a large system?&quot;<br>
I said, no, Im not preparing to hack a system, Im preparing to hack THE system.<br>
THE System... the one that runs our measly little preplanned lives. It's what surrounds
us,<br>
drives us, and controls us. It tax's us, it jails us, it governs us, and it lies to US<br>
.... and i want to know the truth.<br>
And I wont stop until I do...<br>
<br>
This hack won't take place with one computer, onto one system. It's not just a computer
hack, It's a <br>
life hack. I can't do it alone. Hacking goes beyond the computer. It's just an appliance,
there must <br>
be life beyond it, or what would be left to find meaning in?<br>
