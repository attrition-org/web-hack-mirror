<b>We defaced this server as an attempt to alert all the assholes at sonae for the lack of security on their networks. Sonae is one of the biggest companies in Portugal and its owner are one of the richest people of portugal. They are the main responsables of a big commercial manipulation on Portugal. First it was a chain of shopping malls and now they are trying to enter to the telecomunications area to see if they can get more money from everyone. That´s right, their function is to explore each of us as much as they can. This type of capitalism and manipulation will only contribute to the richness of the rich and to the poverty of the normal portuguese citizens who pay their bills. Continente, sonae, oni they are all examples of such monopolism. Nemesystm of the DHC (http://dhcorp.cjb.net) adds: When someone used to have a store it was to sustain him/herself. Today we see huge corporations with a yearly revenue of small companies abuse their monopolistic powers. Personally I have no problems with big companies having a lot of power, but when this power is being misused something must be done. Now maybe this defacement will not bring about a turnaround in company policy, but at least it shows that not EVERYBODY has decided to let things rest. And maybe this will aid people who think these practices cannot continue any longer in their struggle for improving the rights of common people in Portugal who suffer albeit very little "suffering" from companies like this.  <br>
