  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> Now, a message. Irony 
    is all around us today with many daily events proving to be ironic. One that 
    is apparent to me is that JP, antionline.com's frontman, appeared on a televison 
    program commenting on how he helped the FBI catch Chameleon, another so called 
    'hacker.' A person running a 'hackers' site helping to catch a hacker. That 
    In its self is pure irony but the more ironic part is that the same day JP 
    was on that television program, one of the sites under him, anticode.com was 
    defaced. I do not know if rootworm, the defacers knew that the program he 
    was to appear in was broadcast on that day, but that is a very funny view 
    on irony indeed. </font></p>
