      <P align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana">India's False claim on Kashmir.</font></P>
      <P align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana">On October 28th 1993, Robin 
        Raphel stated that Washington did not recognise the Instrument of Accession 
        to India as meaning that Kashmir is not forever more an integral part 
        of India. She expressed the view that the whole of Kashmir is disputed 
        territory, the future status of which must be determined in accordance 
        with the wishes of the people of Kashmir. </font></P>
      <P align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana">The International Commission 
        of Jurists (ICJ), based in Geneva, recently, passed a resolution proclaiming 
        Kashmir's accession to India as bogus and null and void. The ICJ went 
        further by condemning the human rights violations in Kashmir. These events 
        serve to highlight the disputed status of Kashmir by focusing on the fraudulent 
        nature of the Instrument of Accession which was 'signed' by the Mahrajah 
        of Kashmir on 26th October 1947. </font></P>
      <P align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana">The Indians claim that the 
        Instrument of Accession was signed by Mahrajah Hari Singh on 26th October 
        1947, in which the Mahrajah agreed to accede to India in return for military 
        assistance to put down the popular rebellion against him, seen at that 
        time as an invasion by tribesmen from neighbouring Pakistan. The details 
        of the accession were worked out between the Kashmiri Prime Minister, 
        MC Mahajan and the Indian official, VP Menon, in Dehli. However, there 
        are serious doubts about the signing of the document. Alastair Lamb (in 
        his book, Kashmir - A disputed legacy 1846-1990) points out that the Instrument 
        of Accession could not have been signed by the Mahrajah on 26th October 
        as he was travelling by road to Jammu (a distance of over 350 Km). </font></P>
      <P align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana">There is no evidence to suggest 
        that a meeting or communication of any kind took place on 26th October 
        1947. In fact it was on 27th October 1947 that the Mahrajah was informed 
        by his MC Mahajan and VP Menon (who had flown into Srinagar), the the 
        Instrument of Accession had already been negotiated in Dehli. The Mahrajah 
        did not in fact sign the Instrument of Accession, if at all, until 27th 
        October 1947. This sheds doubts on the actions of the Indian regime. Some 
        Indian troops had already arrived and secured Srinagar airfield during 
        the middle of October 1947. On 26th October 1947, a further massive airlift 
        brought thousands of Indian troops to Kashmir - BEFORE the signing of 
        the Accession. Therefore, this situation begs the question: would the 
        Mahrajah have signed the Instrument of Accession had the Indian troops 
        not been on Kashmiri soil? </font></P>
      <P align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana">No satisfactory original of 
        the Instrument of Accession has ever been produced in an international 
        forum; a published form has always been shown. Further, the document was 
        not presented to Pakistan or to the UN. In the summer of 1995, the Indian 
        authorities reported the original document as lost or stolen. This sheds 
        further doubt on whether the Mahrajah actually signed the Instrument of 
        Accession. The Governor-General of India at the time, Lord Mountbatten, 
        stipulated that the permanent accession of Kashmir to the Indian Union 
        will only be accepted once the people of Kashmir had been consulted. He 
        noted in a letter to the Mahrajah, "the question of the states's accession 
        should be settled by a reference to the people". Furthermore, when the 
        Kashmir crisis broke out in October 1947, the principle of reference to 
        the people through plebiscite was already established as similar disputes 
        in some other states had been resolved this way.</font></P>
      <P align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana">The Indian Prime Minister 
        J Nehru, accepted this principle and reiterated his position in a letter 
        to the British Prime Minister on 25th October 1947, "our view, which we 
        have repeatedly made public, is that the question of accession in any 
        disputed territory must be decided in accordance with the wishes of the 
        people and we adhere to this view". Therefore, at the time of the so-called 
        accession, the Indian regime accepted the principle of reference to the 
        people. Based on this principle, the Instrument of Accession should have 
        been provisional and conditional upon the outcome of a plebiscite. When 
        India took the Kashmir issue to the UN in 1948, it did so under article 
        35 of Chapter VI which outlines the means for a peaceful settlement of 
        disputes. </font></P>
      <P align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana">It is interesting to note 
        here that India did not present the Kashmir case under the UN Chapter 
        VII which relates to acts of aggression as India was alleging Pakistan. 
        Therefore, it is evident that by raising the issue under Chapter VI, India 
        recognised the Kashmir issue as a dispute, thus conceding that the Instrument 
        of Accession had not confirmed the state to be an integral part of India. 
        India is still party to all the UN resolutions on Kashmir. Moreover, India 
        and Pakistan accepted the UN resolutions of January 1948 calling for a 
        plebiscite in Kashmir to exercise the right of self-determination of the 
        people of Kashmir. India's acceptance of the UN resolutions establishes 
        beyond a doubt, that the future of status of Kashmir would be determined 
        by its people. Therefore, the Instrument of Accession, even if genuine, 
        is rendered null and void</font></P>
      <P align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana">. In the past, attempts to 
        hold a plebiscite have been met with fierce opposition from India. India 
        has known, right from the start, that the result of a plebiscite is a 
        foregone conclusion - the population of Kashmir would have voted to rid 
        themselves of Indian rule.</font></P>
      <P align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana">This has been the case from 
        26th October 1947 to the present day. On the practicality of holding a 
        plebiscite, a paper by the US state department, presented to the UN on 
        2nd December 1947, noted , "the dominion of India may attempt to establish 
        the extant electoral rolls on the basis for the referendum. As these rolls 
        are said to contain less than 7% of the population and were compiled on 
        a basis which served the weight to the members of the wealthiest educated 
        Hindu majority who would obviously vote for accession to India, it is 
        important that the electoral body should in fact be composed on a basis 
        of complete adult suffrage in order that the result of the referendum 
        may be representative of the actual wishes of the people of Kashmir".</font></P>
      <P align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana">In view of the above arguments, 
        it is clear that the Indian case on Kashmir is politically, legally and 
        morally unjustified. The commitment made by India and the UN to allow 
        the people of the state to choose their own future are neither time bound 
        nor do they provide an escape clause for the Indian regime. It is only 
        through fraud and repression that India continues to forcefully occupy 
        a large portion of Kashmir</font></P>
      <P align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana">Please note, we are not a 
        racist group, if you read all our stuff, you must realise our anger. We 
        see people killed everyday, women raped, thick blood lying around, orphan 
        children crying, and on the other hand, zee media (Indians) blame Pakistan 
        for massacres and try to give a impression that Pakistan is responsible 
        for the whole Kashmir issue,and we are responsible for every violence 
        in Kahsmir. We like to apologise to any one that was offended by our defacement, 
        even if it's a Indian. W</font></P>
