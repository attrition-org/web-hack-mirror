<font face=Arial,Helvetica>When I was in the UK last week, I got my email and while it was downloading I surfed to my site. Big surprise when I found out that it had been compromised and that some *^%^@#$ asshole had messed around with it. It took me about 30 seconds to remove his wrongdoing. What a jerk. Of all the websites you can screw around with, my website is the least attractive. Pathetic little idiot. Get a live.
<BR><BR>
I upgraded the engine that drives my site, security has been beefed up and some serious monitoring takes place around the clock to register any attempts at breaking and entering. <BR><BR>
Anyway, all is well now and now I am off to Mark's party<br><br>

<b>The French Hen & What A Beauty</b><br>

<font face=Arial,Helvetica><BR>
So my long trip got rewarded after all. Hooked up with several collegues yesterday to go for dinner in one of Tulsa's best restaurants, the French Hen. Well, it was everything but French but at least they tried. I heard that the customer would be there full force with no less than 15 people. When we got there, most of them had already arrived. Guess selecting the French Hen was a hit. The food was reasonably except for the foie grass which really sucked. The cook had made it non-fat. Why would you want to do that ?! The cuisine police would have shot the cook on the spot. The thing that makes foie grass what it is, is fat. Instead I got something on my plate the was sort of crumbling like old bread. I will probably never understand the people in this country. I think the chef sold us at least ten different bottles of his off-the-menu-these-are really-exclusive wines. Guess we made him happy. 
<BR><BR>
After dinner we went on to some sportsbar. A guy named Fuad suggested it and it was an extremely good choice. There were loads of very good looking women in the bar and he knew almost all the really beautifull and single ones. He introduced me to all of them and actually went around the bar to bring them over to me. Pretty cool! The only downside was that the more beautifull they got, the less brains they had. This was less of a complaint by the time we were ordering boatloads of tequila to have a change of scenery from the Jack Daniels : ) I decided to focus on a very attractive brunette with beautifull green eyes. We talked for hours and unfortunately I don't remember a thing what we talked about due to all the tequila and Jack D. but I guess it was pretty ok. At least I was having a great time. At 1 or so the bar closed and it was suggested we go to Vegas which was fine with me. Actually everything was fine with me at that point. Thank God we didn't go to Vegas as it is a three day drive and I had a meeting next morning at 09:00. We went back to the car and at that point I sort of lost track of my beautifull brunette. It took us almost an hour to get me to the Hilton were I was staying and I heard today that it is upposed to be a 10 minute drive....
<BR><BR>
Off course something stupid happened: I never heard the wake-up call and the collegue that would take me to the meeting called me at 08:25 with the message that we had to leave in 5 minutes. I immediately jumped out of the bed which was stupid as I had a major hangover, showered, packed and arrived only 10 minutes late at the meeting which had not even started. So I am sitting there feeling totally, absolutely, mega wasted and then suddenly Fuan comes over and hands me his business card, whispers to look at the backside of it and goes back to his seat looking even more hung over than me. I look at the back of the card and there it is: the beautifull brunette (her name is Lori) had written down her name and  phonenumber. I know what I'll be doing next time in Tulsa : )

<font face=Arial,Helvetica>Just arrived in Tulsa after about 15 hours of travel. These are the times when you figure out that international travel really sucks. Learn something new everyday. Tulsa is not in Texas but in Oklahoma. Ok, felt a bit stupid when the braindead moron from customs had to point that out. Anyway, arrived in freaking hot Oklahoma and it will only get worse if the weatherman is right. Then I learned something new again. Appareantly there are Hilton hotels in the world that do not server a nice cold beer after 23:00  hours. So I had to buy a couple of beers and take them to my room. Pretty depressing. The thing that made up for all this aggreviation was the fact that these guys have "OverVoice" which basically means I now have a very fast DSL connection to The Net for the next 24 hours. Time to donwload the Pinstripe iso images from Red Hat :)

<font face=Arial,Helvetica>The initial part of the flight to the US was fine. Too bad it was a Northwest airplane with Northwest flight babes as they generally are less good looking than the KLM ones. Actually started in a new book. We landed on schedule in Detroit and then it went down the tubes big time. Our connecting flight to Dallas was scheduled for 21:10 but then the TV screen suddenly said 21:30, and 21:45 and 22:15 and then 22:45. Northwest gave us some really crappy story that the plane that would take us to Dallas was being held up due to very bad weather. Yeah right. Guess they never heard of flying around the bad weather. The new departure time was changed again and again untill we finally boarded at 23:15. Another 3+ hours later we arrived at Dallas International and from there on everything went smooth again. We arrived at the hotel 03:15 and it was a bit so so. Roger was lucky that he wasn't in the hotel already as we would have "interrogated" him over his recommendation. The only good side to the delay was that I hardly have any jetlag. I sleep quite well till 08:00 in the morning and then have some nice fruit breakfast with collegues. The strawberries are terrible. Avoid those if you can. People seem to have gone nuts due to the extremely hot weather here. Yesterday I actually walked outside in my suit while it was a screeming 110F. That is 40+ celcius. My US collegues didn't mind at all and actually said it wasn't that bad because the humidity was so low. Had a fabulous dinner last night in some Brazilian place. Great steaks and lots of it. Welcome to Texas! Drove up to that place in Dave's Corvet. It is quite enjoyable to hear that 5.7 litre V8 roar at 6,000 revs. Tonight I am going to hit the town with Mo who said that there are some really nice places in Dallas which I should see, possibly all of them if time allows. Don't know what kind of places he is talking about.... Luckily I do not have any appointments tomorrow :)<br><br>

<font face=Arial,Helvetica>This afternoon I got back from my trip to London. As always it was quite demanding. On monday evening we went out for dinner with about 12 collegues in some hip Indian restaurant which name starts with a V (veemashwami or something).  Afterwards we went on with about 6 guys and we got back at the hotel at about 03:30. Next morning was a bit tough. I opened the meeting with a few words and then quickly handed it over to the people that would present. The next couple of hours I spent drinking gallons of water. I wonder why.... At about 19:30 I joined several of my collegues at some place in Covent Garden. We stayed there to have some dinner and then moved on to several other places. Went back with David to his hotel were we had some more beers and a burger. Got back at my hotel at about 03:45. Next morning took it easy and flew back to the Netherlands. Got an SMS message from Monique if I would like to have dinner with her and some other people which I did. Got home at about 01:30.<br><br>

<font face=Arial,Helvetica>Today I figured out how to incorporate the tons of updates from <a href=http://www.redhat.com TARGET=_blank>Red Hat Linux 6.2</a> into the original 6.2 tree and turn it back into an iso image with the latest boot image. It took a while but I am now the proud owner of an extremely up-to-date cd that actually installs correctly. <a href=http://www.xfree.org TARGET=_blank>XFree 4.0.1</a> was on my list too but I decided to make that phase II. No need to push my luck. Installing my shiny new cd was a bit of a laugh. Even the "expert" process looks as if it is aimed at the absolute braindead duck that has not progressed beyond sucky micro$haft wizzards. And if that wasn't enough I got welcomed by the Enlightenment windowmanager wich sucks in a major way. Configuring the box back to something sane took me more time than the entire installation. The work has only begun because there are so many things missing or outdated, the biggest ones being <a href=http://www.php.net TARGET=_blank>PHP version 4</a> and <a href=http://www.tcx.se TARGET=_blank>MySQL</a>. Then there is <a href=http://gftp.seul.org TARGET=_blank>Gftp</a> and <a href=http://xchat.org TARGET=_blank>Xchat</a> to name a few more. Sigh, so much to do and so little time.
Hey, maybe I should start my own distro and IPO and become billionaire like those Red Hat guys :)

<font face=Arial,Helvetica>Today is my Dad's birthday. No less than 71 years old and still working. Amazing. I am going there about now and have a nice dinner. Most difficult thing is to find a present. What kind of present can you buy for someone who has it all. Well, I beat the odds. He wants to buy a sailboat and I decided to buy him a book with all the sailing rules or a book with all the nice little villages on the IJsselmeer (or Zuiderzee as he still calls it) in the Nethelands. Or maybe both. That should be an incentive to actually buy that boat soon. I already convinced him he needs to buy a big boat with lot's of luxury on board. He actually likes that thought so it will no longer be a little boat but a big one. Guess who will be on the maiden trip... :-)

<font face=Arial,Helvetica>Tonite I will have dinner with the lovely Monique. This time no snackbar (yes it was *your* fault) but something more stylish. Sher already made reservations but didn't tell me at what place. Guess I will tag along and see where we end up. <br><br>

<font face=Arial,Helvetica>After many hours of hard work on my taxes I finally arrived at the Beach Volleyball Tournament on the beach at the <a href=redirect.php3?op=redir&sid=21&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wanadoobeach.nl>Wanadoo Beachclub</a>. That is what was left of it as I arrived at about 22:00. The final had already been played and the party had started big time. For some reason nobody was able to tell me who had won. Guess nobody really cared. The one thing that stood out was that everybody was totally plastered. Staggering guys all over the place hanging on to staggering women. Being sober I was lightyears away from their kind of fun. The first woman I saw asked me if she could see my private parts if she showed her boobs. I said no and then she showed her boobs anyway. Then I decided it was time to order a strong drink and stay away from the women. Sat down outside with a couple of friends. After a while a short and a t-shirt was too cold so we moved inside and had fun till about 01:30. Then went on to Jerry's place to have loads of snacks, dropped Alwin and Angela at their home and on to Dreamland.<br><br>
