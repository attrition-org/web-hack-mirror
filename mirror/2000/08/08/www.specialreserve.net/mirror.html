  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">SpecialReserve.net 
    and all of there domains hosted on there box were 0wned by do0do0 and -V. 
    Some say (mainly the media) that all we do is rm -rf systems when we get access, 
    that all we want to do is cause damage to the systems...this is done to learn 
    and to show the world that no one is secure.. my boy yt showed this and is 
    currently mia.. who will be next? GForce Pakistan? Again, they showed the 
    world that no one is secure with the .gov and nasa domains they have defaced 
    to get across there message. We think the media don't know what rm -rf is 
    :)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Nothing 
    else to say accept that do0do0 and -V will live on.. Our fans / our haters 
    don't have to worry about that :-)</font></p>
