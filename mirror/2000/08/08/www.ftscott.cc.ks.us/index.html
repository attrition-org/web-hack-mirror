well looks like control is maintained huh admin? you'd think you'd pay a little more
attention to the security issue after p0ss0m tagged you yesterday, then i come in to clean up his mess...
well hopefully i get in the papers down there and stuff, that would be cool.
anyway so you know this was done by none of the student, as i remember they were mainly truckdrivin bronco bustin rednecks for
the most part anyway. (that would make this look real embarrassing, atleast i know a thing or two) and no data was harmed. i suggest a stiff drink and a lap dance...<br>
anyway...<br>
<br>
<b>PROBLEM:</b> your box is seriously unsecure.<br>
<br>
<b>SOLUTION:</b><br>
-maybe think about a hardware firewall solution..<br>
-put pw's on shares...<br>
-service pack 6 - go get it...<br>
-newdsn.exe - get rid of it...<br>
-use better passwords than stupid five letter dictionary words...<br> 
-frontpage, just uninstall the piece of shit...<br>
<br>
anyway until next time we'll check you on the flip side...<br>
