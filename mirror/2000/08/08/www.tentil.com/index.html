<p>&lt;Zapco> Ph33r the feds, uh i mean ph33r the b33r has died. You won't
see any
<br>&lt;Zapco> defaces from them anymore because they realised that defacing
is serious
<br>&lt;Zapco> so the decided to kick p4ntera. They seem to think that
kicking the
<br>&lt;Zapco> main defacer out of the goup will get the feds off their
backs,
<br>&lt;Zapco> HAH@#%&amp;$ I DON'T THINK SO. The feds are still after
you boys so
<br>&lt;Zapco> watch your backs
<br>&lt;Zapco> hackwiser ring a bell?
<br>&lt;Zapco> im wit dem
<br>&lt;Zapco> cuz i fer one
<br>&lt;Zapco> cannot fucking stand omega
<p>^- What the fuck?&nbsp; Um.&nbsp; OKAY!&nbsp; Let's show you the stupidity
of this.&nbsp; We are a little shaken because p4ntera is a fucking loose
cannon.&nbsp; He's going after sites and not covering his trails.&nbsp;
What's worse is he more or less writes FUCK YOU FBI on his defacements.&nbsp;
That's just asking for shit.&nbsp; The rest of the crew and I didn't like
it so we kicked him out.&nbsp; Now he's started another group, hackweiser.&nbsp;
He complains we all turned on him after so much he did for us.&nbsp; What
did he do but give the rest of us a bad name by defacing NT sites and fucking
with the feds?&nbsp; Yeah sure he defaced a lot and what not but he defaced
sites the rest of us found for him.&nbsp; It's not hard to use ./msadc
or ./rds or even ./g0d.c
<p>Another thing.&nbsp; The last line on that IRC log shows the intelligence
of his crew.&nbsp; Om3g4 is the same person as p4ntera.&nbsp; Zapco can't
stand him so he joins his new group.&nbsp; Um.. does anyone else see a
problem with that?
<p>p4ntera.. dude I'll be the first to say you know a lot about what you
do but you're too cocky and that's gonna get you in trouble.&nbsp; You
only have to mess up once.&nbsp; You are my friend and will stay that way
for now, but this has got to stop.&nbsp; You're addicted and you don't
know it.
<p>As for me and a w4x, we're not afraid of the feds.&nbsp; I live in Canada
and w4x lives in the UK so we can't be touched by the American government.&nbsp;
Still, a lot of the crew does live in the US and we ph33r for their safety
at times.&nbsp; No one likes big fat dudes named Marik ass-raping you in
an American prison cell.&nbsp; =P
