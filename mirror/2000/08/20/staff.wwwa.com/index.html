WA staff, this is the email going out to customers.

Dear Web Associates customers,

As some of you know, on Sunday, August 6th, the Digital
Island worldwide network was accessed by hackers.

We were notified by our automatic alarms and, because of
the rapid intervention by our Emergency Response Team, we
were able to immediately contain the violation so that the
majority of our servers were unaffected.

However, because our domain name server (DNS) was affected,
many sites were intermittently unavailable for a period of
time between Sunday and Monday while domain name servers
worldwide were updated.

The problems associated with the intrusion have been corrected
and countermeasures have been implemented <b>so that this type of
hacking will not be able to occur again.</b>

Since Digital Island's Network Operations Centers are home to
some of the world's largest Web sites-- including sites for
Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, MasterCard, and AOL-- the FBI has been
notified.  An investigation by the FBI's Computer Intrusion Squad
will additionally ensure that this type of violation is prevented.

Web Associates would like to emphasize that, while we have strong
security in place, no network can be made completely hacker-proof
(not even the CIA's), but we are working with Digital Island and
the FBI to take all steps possible to ensure that security of our
customers' sites is the best in the world.

Thank you for your patience and loyalty. Please call me if you
have additional questions.

Sincerely,


Mark Tuttle
Chief Technology Officer
