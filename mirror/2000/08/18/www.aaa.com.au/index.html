            <p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">What 
              the problems really are?</font></i></b></p>
            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Kashmiri people claim that the 
              occupation of Kashmir by India is illegal. They do not want to be 
              part of India nor do they want any Indian presence on their soil. 
              The provisions of the Instrument of Accession, if genuine, stipulated 
              that the accession to India was to be ratified by a plebiscite.Since 
              1947, India has occupied Kashmir and has stalled, by whatever means 
              at her disposal, the progress towards the holding of a plebiscite 
              - the original and the most universally accepted solution. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">"There is no doubt that had a referendum 
              had been held in Kashmir, the vast majority of Kashmiris would have 
              voted to join Pakistan. Such a a referendum, in the form of a plebiscite, 
              was promised to the people of Kashmir by the Security Council in 
              1948. India then accepted the principle of plebiscite but has since 
              obstructed all attempts at arranging one"- Kalim Siddiqui.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> In 1957, India further violated 
              the sovereignty of Kashmir by implementing a new State Constitution 
              which, in effect, incorporated the state into the Indian Union, 
              in face of fierce protests from the Kashmiri people, Pakistan and 
              the UN. The new Constitution was formally adopted on 26th January 
              1957 and it declared that "the state of Jammu and Kashmir is and 
              shall be an integral part of the Union of India". Since the adoption 
              of the Constitution, India has got itself into a state of affairs, 
              which can only be described as hypocritical and aggressive.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">On the one hand, India claims that 
              Kashmir is an integral part of the Indian Union. On the other hand 
              India has signed two agreements (Tashkent 1966, Shimla 1972) with 
              Pakistan, in which India agreed to resolve the Kashmiri dispute 
              through bilateral and peaceful means. Further, India is still party 
              to numerous UN resolutions which proclaim Kashmir to be a disputed 
              territory. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">"It is hardly an exaggeration to 
              say that the whole history of Kashmir has been of misgovernment 
              and oppression; nor was this tradition dead in this century. And 
              the political question mark still hangs over the area despite India's 
              past political control and economic effort. Leaving the legal and 
              moral issues aside, the economic disruption caused by the de facto 
              partition along the Cease-Fire line has been deplorable" - J Dupuis.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> More recently, India has increased 
              her role as an oppressor in Kashmir. The deployment of 500,000 troops 
              to silence the voices of the Kashmiri people is seen as the only 
              solution by the Indian government, resulting in gross violations 
              of human rights. These crimes have been carried out as a matter 
              of routine and some are well documented by the various Human Rights 
              agencies. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Please note, we are not a racist 
              group, if you read all our stuff, you must realise our anger. We 
              see people killed everyday, women raped, thick blood lying around, 
              orphan children crying, and on the other hand, zee media (Indians) 
              blame Pakistan for massacres and try to give a impression that Pakistan 
              is responsible for the whole Kashmir issue,and we are responsible 
              for every violence in Kahsmir. We like to apologise to any one that 
              was offended by our defacement, even if it's a Indian. </font></p>
