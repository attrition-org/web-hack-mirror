            <p><i><font color="#FFFFFF">Unjustified Killings?</font></i></p>
            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Since 1989, an estimated 40,000 
              Kashmiris have been killed by the Indian forces stationed in Kashmir. 
              For the last five years the people of the State have intensified 
              their efforts in order to invite the attention of the world community 
              towards the "Kashmir Dispute", though the people of the State had 
              been fighting for their just cause peacefully for the last forty 
              eight years. Indian Government throughout these four decades has 
              been suppressing the people by illegal use of force, putting them 
              into the jails/ Interrogation centres etc. under draconian laws. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Whenever any person demanded holding 
              of " Plebiscite", he has been put behind the bars. The Indian Forces, 
              stationed in Kashmir, have been given a free hand to kill any person 
              they choose. These powers have been given to them under the draconian 
              laws like "Disturbed Areas Act of 1990" and "Indian Armed Forces 
              Act of 1990". Indifference shown by world community to the miseries 
              of people, have encouraged and given a free hand to armed forces, 
              to deal with the people, as they like. In October 1992, the Indian 
              Armed forces started to intensify the killing of people immediately 
              after their arrest. These operations have been carried out under 
              the code name of "Operation Tiger", "Operation Eagle" and "Operation 
              Shiva".</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> Now the armed forces have resorted 
              to another policy of "Catch and Kill" which means that no sooner 
              a person is taken into custody, within minutes he is brutally tortured 
              and killed . The dead body is then thrown into the street. In other 
              cases, innocent civilians are arrested and taken to border areas 
              where they are shot. The Indian government then publicises that 
              these people were militants killed in armed encounters with the 
              troops. It is common practice for the paramilitary forces to walk 
              into a quiet village/town and start shooting indiscriminately, killing 
              innocent and unarmed civilians - all under the pretence of crack-down 
              operations against the Freedom-Fighters. In most cases, innocent 
              civilians are killed, women gang-raped and properties set on fire. 
              Below is a brief catalogue of the unjustified killings by the Indian 
              troops in Kashmir. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This catalogue is by no means complete 
              as thousands of killings go un-noticed and undocumented. The list 
              given below was compiled painstakingly by various Kashmiri Human-rights 
              activists, with great risks to their personal lives. </font></p>

              more than 50,000 Kashmiris have been killed since 1990, with a lot 
              more unaccounted for. Thousands of helpless Muslim Kashmiris have 
              fled across the Line-of-Control to Azad Kashmir and are now living 
              in refugee camps. The Hindu Pandit population has not been immune 
              to the recent unrest either. They have also fled the valley in their 
              thousands and are now living in refugee camps in Jammu and India.
