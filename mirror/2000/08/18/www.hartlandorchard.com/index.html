<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Times New Roman"><big>Um.&nbsp; Okay!&nbsp; Time for a
redefacement!&nbsp; Everyone knows redefacing is dumb, but this was a &quot;hack&quot;</big><br>
<big>by Sephiroth (also known as gay windows frontpage kiddie from irc.msn.com in
#darkblade) and I will take absolutely NO shit from any wanna-be hacker who uses Windows
95 to connect to an unprotected frontpage server.&nbsp; </big></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Times New Roman"><big>Sephiroth: Stick with IRC and your
homosexual cyber sessions in #protocol - I may actually begin to respect you once you 0wn
a *BSD box or even a linux box.&nbsp; Hell I'd say you weren't a lamer if you could use
./g0d on a redhat box but you wouldnt even know how to compile that would you?</big></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Times New Roman"><big>Admin: I only modified what Sephiroth
already did.&nbsp; Nothing was damaged I believe.&nbsp; (how much damage could a loser
like him do?)</big></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Times New Roman"><big>shouts to the new PtB, JcMd, emmy,
Di]v[pLeS and p4ntera (hackweiser leader, yes he talks shit about us but its all part of
the scene)</big></font></p>
