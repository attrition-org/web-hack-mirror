      Competition
      has been part of the human race for as long as man can remember. However,
      this wild race to the top really starts in a person's teenage years.
      There, the bud of competition grows as a teen is surmounted with various
      social and academic pressures. There is the pressure from teachers to
      achieve in class, the pressure from parents to become successful in future
      endeavours, and last but not least, pressure from friends to attain a
      level of social reputation. This pressure to need to fill a certain image
      can be very overwhelming&nbsp;&nbsp; because&nbsp; of</font></td>

    <td width="164" height="342" valign="top"><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">the
      constant labelling that occurs. To name a few, teens may be dubbed
      &quot;smart&quot;, &quot;sporty&quot;, or a shameful &quot;loser.&quot;
      When they are categorized under one of the labels, teens feel the urge
      either to maintain their prestige if classed at a high position, or be
      destined to fight their way up from the bottom of the label ladder.
      Obviously the hike to the top is never easy, and not always successful.
      For the lucky ones, the walk is a breeze. But unfortunately, many teens
      can't muscle their way as easily through drugs, alcohol, and other likes.
      It is, in essence, the survival of the fittest.<br>

Hank leaned forward, signalling for Cletus to pay closer attention.<br>"Cletus, next lab day I will need you to take something from Monique."<br>Cletus immediately shifted uncomfortably in his chair. Cletus began to speak, but Hank interjected,<br>"It's nothing bad. All I need is the contents of the test tube after your lab is over, and AFTER Monique has bubbled away the contents."<br>"You... the test tube... what? Sorry, I'm lost"<br>"All you have to do is take the test tube after Monique has waved her hand over it and empty the gold flakes into this..." he handed Cletus a vile filled with a clear liquid.<br>"That's it." Hank concluded.<br>Cletus inquired about the purpose of the whole procedure, but Hank brushed it off as a "long story" with "people who are not as they appear". Five minutes later they parted.

Last time I saw you, your muscles never rippled so violently, and your facial features are so mature now". Alex blushed at her own words.<br>"And it's all natural" Hank announced proudly.<br>"You think I could poke one of your biceps" Alex asked.<br>Hank flexed his trunk of an arm into a rock solid bowling ball.<br>Alex squealed delightfully at its firmness. They gazed deeply at each other, when Hank broke eye contact with an embarassed laugh, and Alex quickly followed.<br>"I still haven't forgotten about you, Hank. Every time the phone rings, I can feel my heart drip into a puddle of butter. 'Maybe it's Hank' I tell myself."<br>"Alex, there is alot about me that you will never know. And love shouldn't be that way"<br>"Hank, I think I know you better than you know yourself"<br>"Please don't say that, Alex"<br>"It's true though, Hank, and you know it." It was true to some extent. Even since childhood, Alex was able to read Hank's emotions before he even knew what he was feeling. <br>Just then Candice walked up to the table, holding a gold pen.

He suddenly felt very uncomfortable. Why? He hadn't done anything wrong. <br>   "I never knew you liked showing off your biceps so much," Candace said acidly. <br>   "Who is this Hank?" Alex asked him curiously but calmly. She placed a hand on Hanks elbow moving closer to him. Hank tried to shift, growing even more uncomfortable at the tense situation. <br>   "Um, she's a-a friend," he stammered. Candace raised an eyebrow.<br>   "Hank. Forget about the date. Obviously you've got your hands full," she said rolling her eyes as she walked away. Hank started to get up when he felt a tug from behind.<br>   "Just leave her," Alex told him softly, a smile forming on her face.<br>"She's not worth it." Hank looked at her and sat back down as her azure eyes pierced his. She had the expression of pure calmness. <br>   "Oh God," Hank thought to himself. His feelings for her resurged and his face was beginning to flush.<br>   "It's just you and me now," Alex whispered. "And that's how it's going to stay..." she said under her breath.<br>

She was tall, brunette, and always carried those ridiculous sandwich bags? You guys called her 'the Witch'! "<br>"Monique?"<br>"Monique." he repeated "She's in Centerville High now. Don't ask me waht she's doing here, but she doesn't recognize me, I know that much for sure. In fact, I even think she's hitting on me."<br>"Is she pretty now?"<br>"That's beside the point, Alex. I have to warn you about something. She's very dangerous, and if she ever finds out that I'm living here, I fear for my life."<br>Alex looked up with a half smile<br>"Dangerous?... give me a break. Sandwich bag girl is dangerous." <br>"Listen, Alex, I don't expect you to believe me..."<br>"... and I don't..."<br>"... but please, try to avoid her at all costs" <br>Alex picked at her nails like a spoilt child.<br>"And another thing Alex. If she ever attacks you..."<br>"... then I smash her head?..."<br>"... no, you run. You run away as fast as you can. And take this..." Alex handed her a vial of water from his pocket.<br>"I want you to keep this on you at all times. You put yourself at a greater danger by being in my presence"<br>"What, is she, like a real witch or something?" Alex joked<br>"Well, I'm sure your card tricks will still baffle her" Hank teased<br>"Hey, you still don't know how I got that Ace, do you?"<br>Hank laughed warmly.<br>"I have to go now, just watch out for yourself. I'll get the bill"<br>"Hank?" Alex stopped him. "I'm really glad to see you."<br>"Me too" Hank returned.<br>He paid the bill and walked outside into the chill of the twilight.

He's gonna pay for what he did." Alex trailed off.<br>  "Does he know you know?" Monique asked her quickly.<br>  "No. Or else he would trust me just as much as he trusts you." Alex laughed.<br>  "Alex..."<br>  "Yeah?"<br>  "Take care okay?"<br>  "Sure." Alex then hung up and exited the grill, feeling the cold night wind against her face.

She noticed a dark shadow scurry across the alley and she halted, peering closer. She recognized the man's build and hair and ran after the figure. She finally caught up to him and yanked him by the collar.<br>  "Cletus! What the HELL are you doing here?" she snarled. Cletus turned, a guilty expression on his face.<br>  "Ah. Alex, I was just, uh, passing by. You know, nice night and all," he smiled nervously at her. Alex rolled her eyes and pulled on his collar tighter.<br>  "I saw you with Hank a little while ago.

Cletus nodded quickly and turned to walk away, muttering to himself.<br>  "And hey!" Cletus turned back momentarily.<br>  "Don't tell Hank you saw me. Actually, don't tell him you ever knew me." Alex said. Cletus nodded again and left.

Chelsea's right, when they're on their own they can be really nice but as soon as they get into a group it's like that nice person disappears under a mask. That quote from Jellybean is true too- you do eventually become what you pretend to be, so you'd better pretend to be someone you can live with. <br>(CAT, ring any bells?)
