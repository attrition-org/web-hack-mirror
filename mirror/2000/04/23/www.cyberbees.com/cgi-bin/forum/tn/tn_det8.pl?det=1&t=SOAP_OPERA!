It all started with Candice getting a "glance" from the new hottie, Hank. <br>"I asked him to go to lunch" Candice mumbled to Kendra.<br>"Hank? Tall, buff, spikey haired hank?"<br>"No, Kendra, the fiery mexican with a sombraro". Candice had a clever way of being sarcastic.<br>Just then, Monique walked by bobbing her head to the new Britney Spears c.d....<br>"Look at Monique" Kendra said. Monique stopped dead in her tracks and...

"Hmmm..." she thought. "Maybe I should use a spell to snare Hank." She rummaged through her locker and found various sandwich bags filled with strange things. "I think I need some more supplies..." She stuffed those bags into her bookbag and closed her locker and walked home...

She opened the paper bag and set out a couple of funny-looking bottles onto the table. She settled herself down with a thick book and opened it, revealing a strange language. She began to read some of it when she noticed page 8.

"And I rest my case. 300 lbs. right here, Hank." <br>"300 lbs! Whatever. Let me count what you have on there. 50+50+30+20. That's 125.

You know how she tries to act cool and all to attract the guys, except no one's falling for it. Maybe it's just an exterior, so that's why I'm giving it a try. Maybe she's all scared inside and insecure, even though she doesn't show it. Maybe there's something there that is nice inside that no one sees."<br><br>"Ummm... right. So uhhh... let's get back to the weights, shall we?" <br>maneouvered Chuck. He always felt uncomfortable when Hank got into his soul-searching monologues.<br><br>"No, that's it for me. I think I'll head off and get changed." replied Hank.<br><br>"Ok. Catch up with you later."<br>Hank started walking off, and did not see someone running towards him. "Ooowww!" he yelled. <br><br>The girl stopped in her tracks.<br><br>"Sorry about that." she said. Then her eyes grew wide. "Hank?! Omigod!What are you doing here??"<br><br>Hank stammered, "I moved here a  month ago. So how have you been?"<br><br>She said, "Fine fine... uhhh... I'd love to stay and chat, but I'm kinda late for work. What about we meet up tomorrow or something?"<br><br>"Sure. We could go to the cafe after school."<br><br>"Sure. See ya."<br><br>"Bye."<br><br>As she hurried out of the room, Hank could do nothing but stare at her. They had been best friends since they were in kindergarten. Then he moved to England in 9th grade and finally moved back here to Centreville for his senior year of high school. They had somehow lost touch of each other last year.

When he left her, a lot of confused feelings had been raging inside him and he couldn't believe that he was feeling them again now, at this instant.<br>"Geez, get a grip, man," he thought to himself. <br>"Look, I gotta go." Hank told Chuck and quickly left the room. All of a sudden, he had a very big urge to look for her.

I'm in chemistry with her, right? Geez is she some chemist."<br>"How so?" enquired Hank, half attentively.<br>"Alright, so after today's lab was over, instead of cleaning up, she waved her hand over the test tube and it all bubbled away. A few flakes of gold stuff left at the bottom."<br>"Alchemy" Hank whispered to himself, "What did Monique do with the flakes, exactly?"<br>"She emptied them into a vile."<br>"Was there anything unusual about the vile? A goat perhaps"<br>"Now that I think about it, yeah, there was a goat on it. A goat with the letters "BSB" on top of it"<br>"So she's a Barking Street Bully. Cletus, I have some errands to attend to. How about we meet for coffee at around 5:30?"<br>"Is something wrong, Hank?" <br>"No, not at all. I have a friend I would like to catch up with, whom I haven't seen in awhile. Ran into her today. So I think I'll go find her"<br>Cletus seemed confused. "Okay, Hank, 5:30 it is."<br>They split in opposite directions and Hank reached for his cellphone.

All I need is the contents of the test tube after your lab is over, and AFTER Monique has bubbled away the contents."<br>"You... the test tube... what? Sorry, I'm lost"<br>"All you have to do is take the test tube after Monique has waved her hand over it and empty the gold flakes into this..." he handed Cletus a vile filled with a clear liquid.<br>"That's it." Hank concluded.<br>Cletus inquired about the purpose of the whole procedure, but Hank brushed it off as a "long story" with "people who are not as they appear". Five minutes later they parted.

          <td width="509" bgcolor="#c4f3ff" height="76" valign="top"><font face="Arial" size="2">And 7:00 rolled around. Hank and Alex were enjoying a cup of coffee while chatting about the old times.<br>"Hank, I have to confess something. GOD, you look so good now. Last time I saw you, your muscles never rippled so violently, and your facial features are so mature now". Alex blushed at her own words.<br>"And it's all natural" Hank announced proudly.<br>"You think I could poke one of your biceps" Alex asked.<br>Hank flexed his trunk of an arm into a rock solid bowling ball.<br>Alex squealed delightfully at its firmness. They gazed deeply at each other, when Hank broke eye contact with an embarassed laugh, and Alex quickly followed.<br>"I still haven't forgotten about you, Hank. Every time the phone rings, I can feel my heart drip into a puddle of butter. 'Maybe it's Hank' I tell myself."<br>"Alex, there is alot about me that you will never know. And love shouldn't be that way"<br>"Hank, I think I know you better than you know yourself"<br>"Please don't say that, Alex"<br>"It's true though, Hank, and you know it." It was true to some extent. Even since childhood, Alex was able to read Hank's emotions before he even knew what he was feeling. <br>Just then Candice walked up to the table, holding a gold pen.

          <td width="509" bgcolor="#75e3ff" height="76" valign="top"><font face="Arial" size="2">   "Hank?" Candace exclaimed incredously. She quickly eyed the girl seated next to him and instantly felt a little more than jealous.<br>   "Candace???" Hank said softly. He suddenly felt very uncomfortable. Why? He hadn't done anything wrong. <br>   "I never knew you liked showing off your biceps so much," Candace said acidly. <br>   "Who is this Hank?" Alex asked him curiously but calmly. She placed a hand on Hanks elbow moving closer to him. Hank tried to shift, growing even more uncomfortable at the tense situation. <br>   "Um, she's a-a friend," he stammered. Candace raised an eyebrow.<br>   "Hank. Forget about the date. Obviously you've got your hands full," she said rolling her eyes as she walked away. Hank started to get up when he felt a tug from behind.<br>   "Just leave her," Alex told him softly, a smile forming on her face.<br>"She's not worth it." Hank looked at her and sat back down as her azure eyes pierced his. She had the expression of pure calmness. <br>   "Oh God," Hank thought to himself. His feelings for her resurged and his face was beginning to flush.<br>   "It's just you and me now," Alex whispered. "And that's how it's going to stay..." she said under her breath.<br>

She was tall, brunette, and always carried those ridiculous sandwich bags? You guys called her 'the Witch'! "<br>"Monique?"<br>"Monique." he repeated "She's in Centerville High now. Don't ask me waht she's doing here, but she doesn't recognize me, I know that much for sure. In fact, I even think she's hitting on me."<br>"Is she pretty now?"<br>"That's beside the point, Alex. I have to warn you about something. She's very dangerous, and if she ever finds out that I'm living here, I fear for my life."<br>Alex looked up with a half smile<br>"Dangerous?... give me a break. Sandwich bag girl is dangerous." <br>"Listen, Alex, I don't expect you to believe me..."<br>"... and I don't..."<br>"... but please, try to avoid her at all costs" <br>Alex picked at her nails like a spoilt child.<br>"And another thing Alex. If she ever attacks you..."<br>"... then I smash her head?..."<br>"... no, you run. You run away as fast as you can. And take this..." Alex handed her a vial of water from his pocket.<br>"I want you to keep this on you at all times. You put yourself at a greater danger by being in my presence"<br>"What, is she, like a real witch or something?" Alex joked<br>"Well, I'm sure your card tricks will still baffle her" Hank teased<br>"Hey, you still don't know how I got that Ace, do you?"<br>Hank laughed warmly.<br>"I have to go now, just watch out for yourself. I'll get the bill"<br>"Hank?" Alex stopped him. "I'm really glad to see you."<br>"Me too" Hank returned.<br>He paid the bill and walked outside into the chill of the twilight.

There's a phone there."<br>  "Thanks." Alex said casually as she proceeded towards the phone. She quickly dialed a number and waited as the phone rang on the other end. A female voice picked up.<br>  "Hello?" the voice answered.<br>  "Monique? Is that you?" Alex responded.<br>  "Alex? Yeah, it's me.

He's gonna pay for what he did." Alex trailed off.<br>  "Does he know you know?" Monique asked her quickly.<br>  "No. Or else he would trust me just as much as he trusts you." Alex laughed.<br>  "Alex..."<br>  "Yeah?"<br>  "Take care okay?"<br>  "Sure." Alex then hung up and exited the grill, feeling the cold night wind against her face.

The night was unusually cold and Alex pulled her coat closer together. She noticed a dark shadow scurry across the alley and she halted, peering closer. She recognized the man's build and hair and ran after the figure. She finally caught up to him and yanked him by the collar.<br>  "Cletus! What the HELL are you doing here?" she snarled. Cletus turned, a guilty expression on his face.<br>  "Ah. Alex, I was just, uh, passing by. You know, nice night and all," he smiled nervously at her. Alex rolled her eyes and pulled on his collar tighter.<br>  "I saw you with Hank a little while ago. What were you guys talking about?" Alex asked him.<br>  "Hank? What? Never talked to him." Alex raised her eyebrow.<br>  "I wouldn't trust you even if my life depended on it." Alex sneered. <br>  "Hey Alex, we're cool. He was just telling me some stuff. You know, catching up on lost times." he giggled nervously. <br>  "Yeah right." Alex released her grip on him. She quickly snatched the tube he had desperately tried to hide.<br>  "I think I'll have this." Cletus made an attempt to get it back. "I don't want to see your face again unless you want me to tell the police about your little escapade," she threatened him. Cletus nodded quickly and turned to walk away, muttering to himself.<br>  "And hey!" Cletus turned back momentarily.<br>  "Don't tell Hank you saw me. Actually, don't tell him you ever knew me." Alex said. Cletus nodded again and left.
