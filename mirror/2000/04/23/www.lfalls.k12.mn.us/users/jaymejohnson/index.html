<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Local Students Come Away With Medals from HOSA Spring Leadership Conference</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Tuesday, April 11, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">jaymejohnson</a> --></small><br>Four students (Heather Thompson, Sarah Coleman, Tara Adams, and Lynnell Lorenz) attending this year's Health Occupations Students of America Spring Leadership Conference at Cragun's Convention Center on Gull Lake placed third out of 17 teams competing in the Creative Problem Solving event.

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Vaccine for Lyme Disease</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Tuesday, April 11, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">jaymejohnson</a> --></small><br>With summer (hopefully) just around the corner, here is some information from the Mayo Clinic web site (www.mayohealth.org/) on a vaccine for the prevention of Lyme Disease.  For more information, see the above web site.<br><br>A Lyme disease vaccine is available that causes your body to form antibodies that can kill B. burgdorferi (the bacteria that causes Lyme Disease). The vaccine, given in three doses, has been approved for use in people ages 15 to 70 years old. The first two doses are administered 1 month apart, and the third dose is given 12 months after the first dose. You should have the second and third doses before the peak B. burgdorferi transmission season, which usually begins in April. Studies show that the vaccine is 49 percent effective after two doses and 76 percent effective after three doses. Protection may not last more than 1 year after the third dose and booster vaccinations may be required. <br><br>Since the vaccine does not totally protect you from Lyme disease, it is important to avoid tick-infested areas when possible or wear protective clothing, use insect repellents, and check your body frequently for ticks. You should talk with your doctor about risk factors for developing Lyme disease and the cost effectiveness of the vaccine before deciding to get the Lyme disease vaccine.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Preventing Illness</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Thursday, January 13, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">jaymejohnson</a> --></small><br>With the recent flood of all manner of illnesses being seen in the nurse's office, I feel it appropriate to remind all students and staff to pay attention to the 'basics' of preventing illness.  They include: eating a well-balanced diet, getting the proper amount of exercise, getting adequate rest, and frequent and thorough handwashing.  Attention to these basics won't guarantee you'll be free of illness, but they will serve to optomize your immune system decreasing your chances of getting an illness.  Or, should you get sick, they will shorten the length of illness.  Handwashing serves to 'shortcircuit' the process of infection.</p>

One possible explanation advanced by scientists is the high consumption of plant foods among Asian populations.  Another is the growing number of laboratory studies indicating that green tea — the most popular tea in China, Japan and other Asian countries — has anti-tumor effects.<br><br>For more on this and other useful health information, visit the Mayo Clinic's health information web site: <a href="http://mayohealth.org/">http://mayohealth.org/</a></p>
