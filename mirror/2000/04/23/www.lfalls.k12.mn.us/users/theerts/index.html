<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Date for Jr. High Choir Festival Set!</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Monday, February 07, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:theerts">theerts</a> --></small><br>On March 28, 2000 four Jr. High / Middle School Choirs will meet in the LFCMS Commons for an afternoon and evening of great music.  Schools representing District 742 are North and South Jr. High.  Roccori will also bring their middle school choir and Little Falls' Seventh and Eighth grade Festival Choir will also participate.  The students will practice throughout the afternoon and perform a concert free to the public that evening.  The concert time has not yet been set.  There will be more details to follow on the time of the concert.  The guest clinician for the festival will be Long Prairie Director Matthew Colloton.  The mass choir will perform 3 pieces.  The girls from the choirs will perform 1 piece, and the boys from the choirs will perform 1 piece.  Each group will also have a chance to "Shine" and will sing two pieces of their own for the audience and other choirs.  This event promises to be quite exciting.  It is also a great honor to be asked to host the festival this year.  Our middle school vocal music program is well respected and speaks highly of the hard work and dedication the students have put in to make it that way.  We hope to see you there!!!</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Ancient Instruments Lecture</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Monday, January 31, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:theerts">theerts</a> --></small><br>The seventh and eighth grade choir students had a great opportunity to see and hear some real ancient instruments and songs up close and personal on Thursday, January 27.  About 150 students attended the lecture and demonstration presented by Lauren Pelon.  It was quite entertaining and informative.  Ms. Pelon also performed that evening for the general public.  There were many positive comments from the students about the presentation.  They got to see and hear many kinds of instruments and styles of music that they probably had not previosuly been exposed to.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Festival Choir Auditions</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Monday, December 13, 1999 <!-- by <a href="mailto:theerts">theerts</a> --></small><br>This week auditions will be held for any seventh or eighth grade choir student who would be interested in participating in the 2000 Jr. High Choir Festival.  This event may be held here in Little Falls.  I am still working the details out on that.  The schools who have so far expressed an interest to participate are: South Jr. High, St. Cloud, North Jr. High, St. Cloud, Roccori of Cold Spring, and Little Falls Community Middle School.  This event would take place in late March or early April.  Truly a great opportunity for the LFCMS Middle School Choir Kids to Showcase their talents!!  If your child is interested have them see me this week to set up a time to audition.  More to come on this at a later date!</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Fall Concerts</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Monday, November 29, 1999 <!-- by <a href="mailto:theerts">theerts</a> --></small><br>Congratulations to all the students involved in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grade vocal concerts during the week of November 15.  The students have showed great growth musically and have been working hard on developing good part singing and projection.  This was evident at both concerts and all students involved should be commended.  Look for updates on upcoming concerts in "My Calander"!  Also look for sound clips from the concert when the Middle School Homepage is ready to go.....very soon!!  <br>Thanks to all of those who support the Vocal Music Program at LFCMS!!<br>T. Heerts</p>
