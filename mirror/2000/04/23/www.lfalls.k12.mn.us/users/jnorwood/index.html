It hardly seems possible that so much time has passed.  I try to make sure that the main district page is updated at least once or twice each week, but I have been negligent in updating my own little spot on the net . . . <br><br>As Spring trimester begins at the High School, the <a href="http://www.lfalls.k12.mn.us/users/myavatar">Avatar project</a> is about to swing into full production mode, with all major scenes needing to be "in the can" in the next three months.<br><br>A new crop of students is beginning the Web Page Design course I co-teach with Ms. Kalahar during 6th hour.<br><br>I have picked up several independent study students in Digital Media Production, Digital Audio Production, and Screenwriting.<br><br>I've been creating a demo of a staff development/training system which will allow staff members districtwide to access short (1-3 minute) web-accessible video tutorials covering such things as updating their district web pages, using the Internet effectively, and learning various software programs.<br><br>Stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">The Joys of OS X Server</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Wednesday, December 22, 1999 <!-- by <a href="mailto:jnorwood@lfalls.k12.mn.us">norwood</a> --></small><br>I've spent the last day or so hip deep in helping configure a new file server so that we can begin deploying a group of new iMacs and iBooks to teachers and an industrial technology lab.  Why a new server?  Well, time marches on, and the new machines will not work with our existing management software (AtEase), so we find ourselves beginning the process of switching to the new system that Apple has developed to take the place of AtEase. Only we don't know if it will work with all of our old stuff . . . so we will end up with two systems running simultaneously for a while.<br><br>All of this shouldn't make much difference to the end user at the High School . . . things should look and work pretty much the same.  It will just introduce some new learning opportunities on the network management end!</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">TIES Conference Wrap-Up</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Wednesday, November 24, 1999 <!-- by <a href="mailto:jnorwood@lfalls.k12.mn.us">norwood</a> --></small><br>This year's TIES conference was a wonderful learning and sharing opportunity!  District and MSET staff presented a number of sessions, including those listed below.  I have included the session descriptions that were listed in the conference guide.<br><br><b>Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere</b><br><i>Jerry Abraham, MSET</i><br>Session Description: This session will describe how ten school districts in central Minnesota have wired their buildings to allow programs to be broadcast live from any classroom to any or all classrooms, as well as to the home through local access cable.  Information on wiring schemes and necessary equipment will also be covered.<br><br><b>Making "My Avatar:" Little Falls High School Goes Hollywood!</b><br><i>Jim Norwood and Greg Beck</i><br>Session Description: Little Falls High School is three months into a year-long movie production schedule.  Students are creating "My Avatar," a movie exploring issues of personal responsibility in a digital world.  To create the film, students are combining computer animation, digital editing, student acting, and original music.  Copies will be available next year, including curriculum materials.  Come see the early "rushes!"<br><br><b>An Abundance of Growth Through Technology</b><br><i>Kim Kilmer and Karen Maschler</i><br>Gain practical knowledge and tips on creating interdisciplinary, technology-rich units that focus on real life investigations utilizing local resources.  Two fourth grade teachers will take you through a tried and true unit, its development, alignment to standards, and student project examples.  This is a must-see for all K-8 educators.<br><br><b>Learning at Linden Hill</b><br><i>Becky Zerface, Mary Hanson, Julie Beddow-Schubert, Chuck Forss</i><br>What do the Wizard of Oz, Oprah, banking, lumbering, Charles Lindbergh, and the Mississippi River have in common?  Learning at Linden Hill!  This presentation will demonstrate a community and school effort to uncover Minnesota history in a cross-curricular, year-long study.  See how students in second and third grades studied local history and began writing a local Web site for the primary reading level and interest level.<br><br><b>Technology Throughout the Day: Portable Learning Opportunities</b><br><i>Julie Beddow-Schubert and Karen Maschler</i><br>In 1997, all fifth grade students at Little Falls Community Schools entered school with a laptop in hand.  By 1998, over one thousand students in fifth through eighth grade had immediate access to the technology that we as adults expect in our work environment.  This session will address how access to portable technology enhances the teaching and learning process throughout the day in existing curriculum through inquiry-based, communication-rich activities while supporting global learning experiences.</p>

A small "skunkworks" team of students has been working on creating a 3 1/2 minute "pre-trailer," a digital music video combining an original song with student vocals (and co-written by students) with computer animation and live action shots.<br><br>This music video will be presented on the Morning Report early in December, as we kick off a recruiting drive for students and teachers who want to be deeply involved in the creation of the actual "My Avatar" movie.  Script completion and casting needs to occur in December and early January, with principal videography taking place from late January through February and into March.  Editing the rough cut will take place from March through May.<br><br>Final editing will take place during the summer months, with a "world premier" to be held sometime next Fall!</p>
