<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Grad. Standards Testing Guidelines for Students with IEPs or 504 Plans</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Thursday, January 06, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">blundorff</a> --></small><br>According to Minn. Rule, students with IEPs or Section 504 Accommodation Plans may have special considerations on the Basic Standards tests in Reading, Mathematics and Written Composition.  Testing accommodations, modifications, or exemptions may be used to give students with IEPs or 504 Plans an opportunity to meet the Minnesota Basic Standards in Mathematics, Reading, and Written Composition.<br><br>An accommodation is defined as any change in testing conditions which does not alter the validity or reliability of the state standard.  Accommodations may not compromise the security of the test and should be consistent with the goals of the student's IEP or 504 Plan.  Students who have accommodations will have their tests scored according to state scoring procedures.  Students who pass the Basic Standards Tests with accommodations will receive the<br>notation “Pass-State Level” on their graduation standards progress report.<br><br>When selecting accommodations for students, IEP or 504 teams should consider the needs of the student in daily instructional situations as well as any additional needs that might arise in a secure testing situation.  Students may require multiple accommodations such as interpreted directions and extended time.<br><br>A modification is an adjustment to the standard, the test, or the testing conditions that is significant enough to result in a change in the level of difficulty.  A modified standard at an appropriate level of difficulty shall be defined through an IEP or a 504 accommodation process.  Modifications may not compromise the security of the test.  IEP or 504 teams will determine whether students pass or do not pass the modified standard.  Students passing a test with modifications will receive the notation "Pass-Individual Level" on<br>their graduation standards progress report.<br><br>Exemptions are for those very few students for whom the goals and objectives of the IEP or 504 plan are not consistent with or do not address the specifications of the state standards.  Students who are exempted from the Basic Standards Tests will receive the notation "Exempt" on their graduation standards progress report.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Transition Planning</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Tuesday, January 04, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">blundorff</a> --></small><br>Transition planning is an essential part of the individual education program planning process - - it is not a specific program, instructional need, or vocational goal. Transition planning involves students, their families, educators, and community service providers in a unified effort to assist students in successful preparation for their adult lives.<br><br>All students with individual education plans (IEPs) who have reached grade 9 or age 14 will have an IEP that addresses transition.  The IEP transition planning team is not a new team, instead, individuals who can assist and support students in their adult lives are invited to join the existing team.  During the transition period, each secondary student's IEP/transition planning team needs to be expanded to include non-school agencies, service providers, and other community members (e.g., employers, church leaders, scout leaders). When selecting people to assist students with their plans for the future, the team should first consider the types of services and supports the student may need to meet his or her adult goals.  The composition of each student's planning team will have a significant impact on the ultimate effectiveness of an IEP/transition plan.<br><br>The five areas of transition include employment, home living, community participation, recreation/leisure, and post-secondary education.  It is essential that the IEP/transition planning team understand the student's adult goals.  The most important task is to come to a clear understanding of the student's desires, and then to build on that annually.  The real art of good transition planning is to build and refine the plan throughout each year of a student's high school career.<br><br>Transition planning for high school students with disabilities is a focus on the future that brings about successful employment and independent living within the community after high school.  Simply put, transition refers to the passage from secondary education, including special education and services, to adult life.</p>
