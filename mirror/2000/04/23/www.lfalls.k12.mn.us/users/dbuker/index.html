<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">BUILD THE DREAM</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Thursday, April 20, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">dbuker</a> --></small><br>Build the dream -- You can call it whatever you wish, a dream, goal,<br>life plan steps.  The list goes on and on, but the important thing <br>to remember is that whatever we decide to call it, for some reason <br>or another we have been called to see it to manifestation.  Does <br>that mean that we're going to be able to make it happen easily?<br><br>Probably not.  In many cases it's going to take a lot of hard work.<br>Perhaps at times your goals will appear as though they're out of<br>your grasp.  Trust me on this when I assure you that you're not<br>alone in this feeling.  It's a perfectly normal phase of the<br>achievement process.<br><br>One way of looking at this is to say that if achievement were easy<br>we'd all be driving around in $100,000 Mercedes and living in one<br>million dollar homes and there certainly wouldn't be anyone homeless <br>or living in poverty (as this is one of the goals I work on as well.).<br><br>Alas, the old saying "Rome wasn't built in a day" holds true.  You<br>see we have to begin by 'building the dream'.  Often it starts out <br>small.  That is we take that first step towards what we want to see <br>happen in our lives (or the lives of others), then another, followed<br>by another.  Over a period of time these same small steps and actions <br>that we take begin to become ingrained in who we are.  It is at this <br>very point that the 'dream begins to build us'.  May you find a dream <br>that you believe is worth building.<br><br>Josh Hinds</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">The Life We Choose </font> </strong><br><small>Posted Wednesday, April 19, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">dbuker</a> --></small><br>Here's the premise: We are all, right now, living the life we choose. <br><br>This choice, of course, is not a single, monumental<br>choice. No one decides, for example, "I'm going to<br>move to L.A., and in five years I will be a waiter in a<br>so-so restaurant, planning to get my 8-by-10's done<br>real soon so that I can find an agent and become a<br>star," or "I'm going to marry a dreadful person and<br>we'll live together in a loveless marriage, staying<br>together only for the kids, who I don't much like,<br>either." <br><br>No. The choices I'm talking about here are made<br>daily, hourly, moment by moment. <br><br>Do we try something new, or stick to the<br>tried-and-true? Do we take a risk, or eat what's<br>already on our dish? Do we ponder a thrilling<br>adventure, or contemplate what's on TV? Do we walk<br>over and meet that interesting stranger, or do we<br>play it safe? Do we indulge our heart, or cater to our<br>fear? <br><br>The bottom-line question: Do we pursue what we<br>want, or do we do what's comfortable? <br><br>For the most part, most people most often choose<br>comfort - the familiar, the time-honored, the<br>well-worn but well-known. After a lifetime of<br>choosing between comfort and risk, we are left with<br>the life we currently have. <br><br>And it was all of our own choosing. <br><br>Peter McWilliams<br>Do It!

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">A KITE FLIES UPON A STRING</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Tuesday, April 18, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">dbuker</a> --></small><br>Rising against gusting breeze, the kite flies.  Tethered but by <br>a simple string, wind caressing its face, trailing tail behind, <br>up...up...up it climbs.  Flittering side to side.  Dipping, lilting, <br>skirting...ever taunting its line, "Higher...higher...higher..."<br><br>Let the string roll too rapidly from its spindle, and the wind <br>loses its grasp.  Hold on too tightly, and the kite can&#8217;t possibly <br>rise.  Loose and hold at the &#8216;just right&#8217; moments...the kite soars. <br>Effortlessly...serenely...flirting with the very heavens.  You see, <br>when it comes to kite flying, the secret&#8217;s in tending the line.  <br>It&#8217;s in sensing the shifting gusts.  It&#8217;s in being flexible...in knowing <br>when to hold on...and when to let go.<br><br>And so it is...with life.<br><br>Challenges.  Opportunities.  Ups.  Downs.  Endings.  Beginnings.  <br>Each one crafting its own adventure (or misadventure) along your <br>way...each paving a small piece of your journey.  To rise, to <br>succeed, to be fulfilled...to reach the heavens...commands finesse.  <br>It&#8217;s dynamic.  It&#8217;s never ending.  While surely there are times to <br>be steadfast with resolve, life&#8217;s mostly a matter of adapting...of <br>being flexible.<br><br>Obstacles have reared their heads amidst most every worthwhile <br>effort since the beginning of time, and (as best as I can tell) <br>will forever continue to present themselves.  Call them &#8216;tests&#8217;, <br>call them &#8216;trials&#8217;, call them &#8216;challenges&#8217;, &#8216;barriers&#8217;, or simply <br>&#8216;irritations&#8217;.  If you find yourself currently facing one (or perhaps <br>more), take heart, for as Frank Clark put it, "If you find a path <br>with no obstacles, it probably doesn&#8217;t lead anywhere."<br><br>The key is to look in the mirror.<br><br>You see...it&#8217;s not the problem that&#8217;s the problem...it&#8217;s how you <br>handle the problem.  When faced with any kind of challenge, consider <br>the advice of Gunnery Sergeant Tom Highway (from the movie <br>"Heartbreak Ridge"), as he so often prodded his troops, <br>"Improvise...adapt...overcome!"  Do so, and you&#8217;ll soon find yourself <br>rising to the other side of your dilemma.  Dig your heels in...and <br>you&#8217;ll discover very quickly why rocks don&#8217;t fly.<br><br>Success in every piece of your life, whether career, financial, with <br>your children, in your relationships, even in your moment-to-moment <br>attitudes with yourself, requires a proper blend of control...and <br>flexibility.  It&#8217;s just like skillfully tending the string of a <br>soaring kite.  Winds shift.  Gusts rise and fall.  (Almost) <br>everything changes.  Such is not a bad thing.  The lowly caterpillar <br>grows beautiful butterfly wings only through change.  So...pay <br>attention.  Be flexible.  You see, a life well lived is an ongoing <br>culmination of recognition and response...of loosing and grasping...<br>of holding on...and of letting go.  Think about it.  A kite flies <br>on a string...not on a stick.<br><br>Until next time,<br><br>Tim<br></p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">WHY ASK WHY?</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Friday, April 14, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">dbuker</a> --></small><br>A question that naturally comes to mind when something goes wrong<br>is "Why?"  But it's a question fraught with danger.  Research has<br>repeatedly shown that the human brain is designed to answer a<br>question with whatever knowledge it has (no matter how little)<br>and come up with a plausible answer (however wrong).  Self-blame<br>or victimhood is a frequent side effect.<br><br>For example, you can ask why you're overweight and, without any<br>problem at all, your mind will come up with answers.  But all it<br>can give you are theories.  What's the "real" answer?  Is it because<br>you weren't loved as a child?  Is it a genetic weakness in your<br>family?  Is it an evolutionary holdover precaution against famine?<br>Is your mouth simply bored?<br><br>The problem with a why question is that you get too many answers<br>you can do nothing about.  You can't change your childhood or a<br>genetic weakness.<br><br>There is only one good thing about asking why: It can be<br>entertaining.  It's intriguing.  It's like a mystery and mysteries<br>capture our attention like nothing else.  But if what you want is<br>to handle the situation well or solve the problem and get on with<br>the business of living, ask how not why.  It's more efficient.<br><br>Since your mind will try to answer any question you put to it, <br>the kind of question you ask makes a big difference.  So ask <br>what you really want to know: "How could I get slimmer?"  Or <br>"How can I avoid this problem in the future?"  Or "How can I <br>solve this problem now?"  Or "How can I make things a little <br>better?"  Let your mind go wild on one of those questions.  <br>The answers will be more productive.<br><br>With how, you go straight for a useful answer.  You avoid <br>getting sidetracked into what can become an endless search <br>for "understanding."  With how your answers lead to actions.  <br>And it is actions that solve problems and produce real change.<br><br>Adam Khan</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">The finish line </font> </strong><br><small>Posted Wednesday, April 12, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">dbuker</a> --></small><br>Imagine how completely frustrating and confusing it would be to run a race in which there was no clearly defined finish line. How would you know which direction to run? How would you keep from wasting your efforts? How would you find the drive and motivation to go forward, if you didn't even know where forward was?<br>With no finish line, not only would you not know where you were going, you'd also have no way of knowing how to get there. To run the race, you must know where the finish line is and you must follow a course that will get you to that point.<br><br>The same is true for any accomplishment. It's crucial to know exactly where you are going and to determine the precise course of action which will get you there. A vaguely conceived finish line can never be crossed.<br><br>Do your efforts today have a clearly defined finish line? Are your efforts moving you along the course which will reach that goal? Or are you just running around in circles? The only way you can win the race is by knowing exactly where to run.<br><br>-- Ralph Marston<br></p>

Her only<br>    chance of recovery appeared to be a blood<br>    transfusion from her 5-year<br>     old brother, who had miraculously<br>     survived the same disease<br>     and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the<br>     illness.<br>    The doctor explained the situation to<br>     her little brother, and asked<br>     the little boy if he would be<br>     willing to give his blood to his sister.<br>    I saw him hesitate for only a<br>     moment before taking a deep<br>    breath and saying, "Yes, I'll do<br>    it if it will save her.."   As the<br>     transfusion progressed, he<br>        lay in bed next to his sister and<br>     smiled, as we all did,<br>     seeing the color returning to her cheeks.<br>     Then his face grew pale and his smile<br>      faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a<br>     trembling voice, "Will I start to die right away?"<br>    Being young, the little boy had<br>    misunderstood the doctor; he thought<br>    he was going to have to give<br>    his sister all of his blood in order to<br>    save her.<br>    You see understanding and<br>    attitude, after all, is everything.</p>

After much pushing and<br>    straining, he finally succeeded.<br>            After the peasant picked up his load of<br>    vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the<br>            road where the boulder had been.<br>    The purse contained many gold coins<br>    and a note from the king<br>    indicating that the gold<br>    was for the person who removed the boulder<br>    from the roadway.

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Third Important Lesson   ~</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Thursday, April 06, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">dbuker</a> --></small><br>    Always remember those who serve you<br>   <br>    In the days when an ice cream<br>    sundae cost much less, a 10<br>    year old boy entered a<br>    hotel coffee shop and sat at a table.  A<br>    waitress put a glass of water in<br>    front of him.<br>    "How much is an ice cream<br>    sundae?" he asked.<br>    Fifty cents," replied the<br>    waitress.

The little<br>    boy again counted his<br>    coins.  "I'll have the plain ice cream," he<br>    said. The waitress brought<br>    the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked<br>    away. The boy finished the ice cream,<br>    paid the cashier and left.<br>    When the waitress came back, she<br>    began to cry as she wiped down the<br>    table. There, placed neatly<br>    beside the empty dish, were two nickels<br>    and five pennies - You see,<br>    he couldn't have the sundae,<br>    because he had to have<br>    enough left to leave her a tip.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">You Shall</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Monday, April 03, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">dbuker</a> --></small><br>You shall not worry, for worry is the most unproductive of all human activities. <br><br>You shall not be fearful, for most of the things we fear never come to pass. <br><br>You shall not carry grudges, for they are the heaviest of all life's burdens. <br><br>You shall face each problem as it comes. You can only handle one at a time anyway. <br><br>You shall not take problems to bed with you, for they make very poor bedfellows. <br><br>You shall not borrow other people's problems. They can better care for them than you. <br><br>You shall not try to relive yesterday for good or ill, it is forever gone. Concentrate on what is happening in your life and be happy now! <br><br>You shall be a good listener, for only when you listen do you hear ideas different from your own. <br><br>You shall not become "bogged down" by frustration, for 90% of it is rooted in self-pity and will only interfere with positive action. <br><br>You shall count your blessings, never overlooking the small ones, for a lot of small blessings add up to a big one. <br><br>Author Unknown <br> <br></p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Choices</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Friday, March 31, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">dbuker</a> --></small><br>Any day we wish; we can discipline ourselves to change it all. Any day we wish; we can open the book that will open our mind to new knowledge. Any day we wish; we can start a new activity. Any day we wish; we can start the process of life change. We can do it immediately, or next week, or next month, or next year.<br><br>We can also do nothing. We can pretend rather than perform. And if the idea of having to change ourselves makes us uncomfortable, we can remain as we are. We can choose rest over labor, entertainment over education, delusion over truth, and doubt over confidence. The choices are ours to make. But while we curse the effect, we continue to nourish the cause. As Shakespeare uniquely observed, "The fault is not in the stars, but in ourselves." We created our circumstances by our past choices. We have both the ability and the responsibility to make better choices beginning today. Those who are in search of the good life do not need more answers or more time to think things over to reach better conclusions. They need the truth. They need the whole truth. And they need nothing but the truth.<br><br>We cannot allow our errors in judgment, repeated every day, to lead us down the wrong path. We must keep coming back to those basics that make the biggest difference in how our life works out. And then we must make the very choices that will bring life, happiness and joy into our daily lives.<br><br>And if I may be so bold to offer my last piece of advice for someone seeking and needing to make changes in their life&#8212;If you don&#8217;t like how things are, change it! You&#8217;re not a tree. You have the ability to totally transform every area in your life&#8212;and it all begins with your very own power of choice.<br><br>To Your Success,<br><br>Jim Rohn<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
