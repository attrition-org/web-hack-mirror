<!--
This is the NewsPro archive link file template. This will be used to generate a
page that links to your monthly archive files.
It should be a basic HTML page, except you may insert the following special commands anywhere
in this file:
<Insert!Links> Inserts the month of the archive.
IMPORTANT: The ! was inserted above so that the script won't replace the example with the actual
links. Remove the exclamation mark when actuall using that command.
