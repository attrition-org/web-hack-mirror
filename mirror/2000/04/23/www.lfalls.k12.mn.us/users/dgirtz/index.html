<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Grad Standards Tracking</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Monday, April 10, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">dgirtz</a> --></small><br>Here at the Middle School we have been hard at work getting the Minnesota Grad Standards implemented.  But implementation is one thing.  How do you track the standards as they are assessed, and how do you get quick printed results of student progress?  Enter Mr. Jay Hoglin and RileMaker Pro.  Jay has devoted countless hours in preparing a database that is easy to use, all inclusive of grad standards packages, and is available on the network for teachers to get to when they need to.  At the Middle School, we demonstrated the database to Mark Manning from the CFL, who was impressed with the thoroughness and ease of use of the whole thing.  Where do we go from here?  We ordered 20 copies of FileMaker Pro and installed it on department chair computers.  Staff will be able to enter results from standards testing and results will be available immediately.  Since FileMaker Pro allows multi-user access, any teacher who needs to add results will be able to do so at their own pace.  Incidentally, Jay has not only prepared a Middle School database....he has the Elementary and High School databases ready too!!!!  Thanks for the hard work by our great staff.      </p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Open House</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Monday, March 06, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">dgirtz</a> --></small><br>Well, it has happened!!! The Middle School Open House for Middle Level Education Week was a huge success.  Thanks to the great work by the committee headed by Mrs. Foltz and Mr. Hoskins, many great things going on in the Middle School were highlighted.  Take a look at the Middle School website at <a href="http://www.ms.lfalls.k12.mn.us">http://www.ms.lfalls.k12.mn.us</a> for pictures of the open house.  Education is GREAT at the Middle School.<br></p>

What is this big building with schedules, classes all around the building, and a plethora of great teachers, all about?  How will they survive???  Well, one way to find out what the Middle School is like is to have an orientation.  Oddly enough, that is what is going on Tuesday February 29th and Thursday March 2nd at 7:30 PM at the Middle School.  The WINGS students have also prepared a video that takes a lighthearted look at life at the Middle School.  So if you are a 5th grader, don't worry. The Middle School staff is ready to serve!!!!</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">More Technology....</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Wednesday, February 09, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:dgirtz@lfalls.k12.mn.us">dgirtz</a> --></small><br>It has been awhile since an update of my page has happened....well here it is.  I have been involved in the production of "Number The Stars" at the Paramount in St. Cloud playing the role of Papa Johansen.  This is a Central Minnesota Children's Theatre production that is based on the book by Lois Lowry dealing with the Danish Jews during the Holocaust.  What has this got to do with Technology?  Well, for starters, the stage is graced with a 12' x 12' screen with images of WWII projected on it.  And the sound effects are Internet-based downloads of public domain sound bites.  Greater yet is the fact that the 6th graders from the Middle School and the 5th graders from Lincoln got to come to see the show.  The 6th graders from the Middle School are studying the Holocaust and the students will use some of the knowledge they gained as they present their portfolio projects in Ms. Bolan's class.  In fact, we will hopefully do a presentation to the school board on the portfolios because Mrs. Susy Prosapio, school board member, was witness to the 6th graders work on their projects during school.  Wow!!!  Technology crosses many disciplines!!!  It is great when it is integrated to enhance a class.  More to come.... </p>

Technology applications at the Middle School include: <br>Mr. Hoglin has been tirelessly working on a Grad Standards reporting program that has an easy interface, easy data entry and easy understanding.  Keep your eyes posted on the progress as we look to the future.<br>Mr. Trick had students using HyperStudio as a Jeopardy game for the conclusion of a unit in his science class.<br>Mrs. Meyer, Ms. Thorson and Mr. Hoglin have been using Geometry Sketchpad to teach algebraic concepts with their classes.<br>Mrs. Blaine and Mrs. Lutzwick have perfected the transferring of grades between Making The Grade and the district's grade reportding system (SASI) making the procedure painless. <br>And finally...we made it through the Y2K scare unscathed!!  Thanks to Cliff Schmitz, the district network coordinator, and all of the great technicians in the district.<br>And now for 2000.........</p>

Here I can communicate with the world from the comfort of the office or even from the greater comfort of my home! I hope that you have a great holiday season and also hope that you will continue to check out the personal pages of the Little Falls teaching staff. And remember that all of the great technology leaps are a direct result of the voting confidence of the Little Falls public!!! <br><br>You passed the referendum 5 years ago and it is because of that that we have the great ability to communicate that we didn't have before the referendum passed. Keep your eyes and ears open for more information on technology updates at the district level, and watch as our buildings are transformed into schools without walls!!!!!<br><br>And now back to work!!! Gee, it's cold out!!!!</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Projects</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Wednesday, December 08, 1999 <!-- by <a href="mailto:dgirtz@lfalls.k12.mn.us">dgirtz</a> --></small><br>Have you ever wondered what it was like to be a Middle School student?  Was the anticipation as a 5th grader almost too much? As you looked at the huge building on 1st Ave did you shudder with fear or did you leap for joy at this rite of passage?  These and other Middle School questions will finally be answered by Mr. Conley's class as they tackle a video project that depicts what the Middle School transition is really like for 5th graders.  The video series will be used for the 5th grade orientation by Dr. Turk and Mrs. Schmidt in February and March.  Keep your eyes posted as the WINGS (TAG Program Students) take on the daunting task of telling about what life is like at the Middle School!!</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">New Trimester, New Try-mester</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Wednesday, December 01, 1999 <!-- by <a href="mailto:dgirtz@lfalls.k12.mn.us">dgirtz</a> --></small><br>Believe it or not we are already diving into the second part of the school year.  At the Middle School I know that the staff and students will be ready for a new Try-mester.  What is a Try-mester, you ask??  Well, it is a place and time where we as educators and students try something new with technology.  For example, Ms. Bolan and I are working on a HyperStudio Holocaust Portfolio that her students will be using instead of writing a routine paper report assignment.  Mr. Wood is using HyperStudio for his Music Discovery classes as they do research into musicians of their choice.  Mrs. Leinen  is using scanners and an AppleWorks template for a project with Mrs. Foltz.  And 5th graders coming into the Middle School will be treated to a video presentation created by Mr. Conley's class to be used for the orientation program in March.  In the office, Mrs. Lutzwick is scanning grades for report cards, while Mr. Stumpf in the ITE department is beginning to put some of his lessons online.  Soooo, what is a new Try-mester?  You are seeing it work in the trials by many Middle School Staff members.  More Try-lights to come!!!  </p>

Consider, for example, the fact that you check email first thing in the morning, that you print most things without even second thought, that you check out the internet for ideas for your teaching, you put your grades in your Making The Grade and that you check your messages on your phone as you see the light blink.  Remember that all of this is made possible via the Technology Referendum.  Remember that when you talk to community members and when you pump up the district that we have what we have because of the great community support! </p>
