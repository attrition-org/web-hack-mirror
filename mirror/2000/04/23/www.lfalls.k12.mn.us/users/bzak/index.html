<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Titanic</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Friday, April 14, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">bzak</a> --></small><br>We have recently started a unit on the Titanic which the students are really enjoying.  We have been learning about the facts of this tragedy through books and documentary videos.  Along with learning about this, we are also working on writing projects.  The students are writing about the story of the Titanic, a poem about the Titanic or a creative writing of how they survived the sinking of the Titanic.  The students writing has been excellent so far.  We will also be completing a drawing/coloring project on the Titanic.  The students will be working in cooperative groups and making a poster of the Titanic.   </p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Travel Projects -Continued***</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Sunday, April 09, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">bzak</a> --></small><br>The destinations are selected and we have been doing research in school.  Some students are already typing a short report about their chosen destination!  The project part is to be completed at home.  This is a great opportunity for you and your child to work and learn together.  The children should bring in the report/project on Monday, April 17th and please try to make it to our class presentation on Thursday, April 20th at 9:00 a.m.  We will have food too!!!</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">More Enrichment Projects!</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Thursday, March 30, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">bzak</a> --></small><br>Ms. Kimman has some great ideas for enrichment projects--if you finish your travel project and would like to keep working!<br><br>Here are the ideas:<br>ANIMAL PROJECT-  Pick any animal. Write a paragraph or 1 page report on it and bring in a picture or an illustration of the animal to share with the class.<br>SPORTS BIOGRAPHY- Research and write a paragraph or 1 page report about your favorite athlete.  Bring in a picture or sketch this person.  This will be told from the third person point of view.<br>AUTOBIOGRAPHY- Write a story about yourself.  This should be written from the first person point of view. Include facts and opinions!<br>MATH IN REAL LIFE- Interview 3-5 adults about how they use math in their lives.  Tell the class why math is important to these people.  Then write your own word problems using multiplication<br>AIR AND FLIGHT- Our next science unit will be on this subject.  See what you can find out about this topic using the internet or other resources and write a short report on it.  Or you could research an important person in flight such as Charles Lindbergh and write a short biography.<br></p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">TITHONUS</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Saturday, March 25, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">bzak</a> --></small><br>We were very happy to get the news that our adopted manatee, Tithonus, has been sighted this spring in Blue Springs, Florida.  He did not receive any new propeller cuts over the winter.  We will continue to monitor his migration, along with several other manatee friends.  We will be doing manatee writing projects this week, using The Amazing Writing Machine.  <br>Monarchs have been sighted as far north as Arkansas.  We are still awaiting the return of symbolic monarchs from Mexico.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">OUR NEW STUDENT TEACHER</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Saturday, March 25, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">bzak</a> --></small><br>Jennifer Kimman will be teaching full time in our classroom for the next two weeks!

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Looking Ahead--------</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Saturday, March 04, 2000 <!-- by <a href="mailto:">bzak</a> --></small><br>We have many interesting "things" to study in the next few weeks!<br>***We will be following the migration of the manatee and also the southern migration of the monarch through Journey North on the internet. I'll get the address to you so your children can do research and mapping at home! We are anxiously awaiting the return of our symbolic monarchs from Mexico also! We will be studying the Native Americans of this area and hope to learn more about our local history!<br>The children should be thinking of a place they would like to travel to--as this will be the topic of a research project we will be working on in school and at home!  All this, besides our regular curriculum, should keep us BUSY and LEARNING!</p>
