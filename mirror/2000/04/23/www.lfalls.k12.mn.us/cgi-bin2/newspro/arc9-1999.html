<!--
This is the NewsPro archive file template. This will be used to generate all your monthly archive
files. It should be a basic HTML page, except you may insert the following special commands anywhere
in this file:
<Insert!Date> Inserts the month of the archive.
<Insert!News> Inserts the archived news (pretty useless if you don't include this).
IMPORTANT: The ! in the example above was inserted so that the example wouldn't be confused by
the script with the actual command. Remove the exclamation marks from the example when using
those commands.

We have just set up a new server and are in the process of transferring and reconfiguring files.  Things will be ugly and not very functional for a day or so . . . but should be fairly stable by Monday!</p>
