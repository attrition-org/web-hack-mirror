<!--
This is the NewsPro archive file template. This will be used to generate all your monthly archive
files. It should be a basic HTML page, except you may insert the following special commands anywhere
in this file:
<Insert!Date> Inserts the month of the archive.
<Insert!News> Inserts the archived news (pretty useless if you don't include this).
IMPORTANT: The ! in the example above was inserted so that the example wouldn't be confused by
the script with the actual command. Remove the exclamation marks from the example when using
those commands.

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Rapid Growth!</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Monday, November 29, 1999 <!-- by <a href="mailto:&lt;InsertEmail&gt;">&lt;InsertName&gt;</a> --></small><br>The number of staff members requesting individual district web site pages continues to grow, as do the number of pages with actual "live" content.  Toward the bottom of the right hand column of this page you will see a list of Community Middle School teachers who are beginning sites. More will be following every day.<br><br>Thank you to Integrationist Dave Girtz for his quick offer to inservice Middle School staff today and for making sure the first sites were set up and ready to go for staff members to begin adding their own news and calendar information.<br><br>One site I'd like to point out is Mr. Stumpf's <a href="http://www.lfalls.k12.mn.us/users/rstumpf">Middle School Technology Education</a> page, which he is using as a pointer to a more fully developed web site.  The title and address of this page will probably change soon to better reflect its focus as a shared page focusing exclusively on Middle School Technology Education.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">More Additions</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Wednesday, November 17, 1999 <!-- by <a href="mailto:&lt;InsertEmail&gt;">&lt;InsertName&gt;</a> --></small><br>If you look toward the bottom of the right hand column of this page, you will see the first links to pages that have been set up for several Lindbergh Elementary school staff.

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">District Staff Web Page Update</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Tuesday, November 16, 1999 <!-- by <a href="mailto:&lt;InsertEmail&gt;">&lt;InsertName&gt;</a> --></small><br>If you look at the list to the right, you will see that individual home pages have been set up for 28 district staff members so far!  The response from teachers has been nearly overwhelming . . . there is still quite a list of people to set up.  I'm taking it a little slow, just to see what kind of problems people run into!<br><br>Those who have added material to their pages have the <img src="../../new1.gif"> graphic by their names.  I may not have caught them all yet . . . and others will be adding to their pages.  (I won't keep the "new" thing up forever! Just while things get rolling...)</p>

The Riverwatch pages and other pre-existing district web content will be moving over to the new server in the next few days.  Several staff pages are being prepped and will be live next week.</p>
