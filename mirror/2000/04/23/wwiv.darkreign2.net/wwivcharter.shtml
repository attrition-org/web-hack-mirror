This is the official World War IV charter, which outlines the league's
procedures and the organization of the league. When the charter was written up
every possible situation was taken into account and solutions laid out for those
situations. Obviously, some situations that can't be settled with the current
charter will arise, and the charter will need to be modified so that those
situations can be resolved. When this occurs, the new one will be posted asap.
<p>Please keep in mind that the charter may only be modified if it is saved
under another name and credit is given to the original author, along with the
person(s) who modified it. I don't mind if you use the charter as an outline for
another league or if you post it on another site, as long as proper credit is
given, and WWIV is notified at <a href="mailto:dsoboolik@uswest.net">dsoboolik@uswest.net</a>.
If you have a question or notice any errors in the document, please send an
e-mail noting the correction to <a href="mailto:dsoboolik@uswest.net">dsoboolik@uswest.net</a></p>
<p>If you don't like reading long documents on a computer, you can download a
copy of the charter and print it out.</p>

<p class="bigcharterhead">World War IV Charter</p>
<p>Version: 1.1.1<br>
Author: Leebo, League Administrator<br>
Questions, comments: dsobolik@uswest.net<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="charterhead">World War IV in a Nutshell</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="charter">World War IV (WWIV) is an online Dark Reign 2 (DR2) League.
However, it is actually much more than a league in the traditional sense. It
takes the competitive elements of a ladder and the community of a clan, throws
in a really cool online campaign and produces &quot;The Ultimate League.&quot;</p>
<p class="charterhead">World War IV Organization</p>
<p class="charter">Due to the logistics involved, WWIV's membership will be
limited to 96 people. Those 96 will be divided up into six groups of 16 people,
called squadrons. Each squadron will be given a name that corresponds to a
letter of the Greek alphabet. The names will be: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta,
Theta, and Omega. The Omega team will be reserved for staff members of WWIV and
select members chosen by the staff of WWIV. Each squadron will be run and
maintained by a Squadron Commander, who will handle the squadron webpage and all
in-squadron business.</p>
<p class="charter">From there, each squadron will be divided up into 8 groups of
2 people. These groups will be called teams and will be given names that
correspond to the Roman alphabet. They are A, B, C, etc. all the way up to H.</p>
<p class="charterhead">Squadron Interaction</p>
<p class="charter">The squadrons will interact in the WWIV online campaign,
appropriately named World War IV. The campaign will take place on future earth
(During the same time as Dark Reign 2) and the goal for each squadron will be to
take over the world. A map of future earth will be drawn up and then divided up
into 6 equal territories (one for each squadron). These squadron territories
will then be divided into 8 territories, one for each team of the squadron.</p>
<p class="charterhead">Squadron Battle</p>
<p class="charter">The squadrons will battle over the territory on the map
mentioned above. The battles themselves will be fought by the 2 person teams of
each squadron, but they will be fighting for their squadrons. To ensure
smoothness and consistency of operation, all battles will occur on one night a
week at a designated time, which is Saturday nights at 8:00 PM central time. You
will not need to attend EVERY event, however if you don't attend regularly
enough you will be dismissed from the League. How each Saturday night event will
go is best explained through an example:</p>
<p class="charter">Everyone in the league will meet in the WWIV IRC chat room
(the server and room name are on the website) at 8:00 central time. At around
8:15, the League administrator will call the meeting to order (in other words,
moderate the chat). At that time he will ask each squadron commander
(alphabetically, by squadron name) which attacks they would like to make. Each
squadron commander will have consulted with his squadron on which attacks to
make sometime in the week before the event. The Squadron Commander will then
inform the League Administrator in the following method:</p>
<p class="charterexample"><font color="red">League Admin:</font> Alpha Squadron
Commander, do you have any attacks to declare?<br>
<font color="red">Alpha Squad Commander:</font> Yes. Alpha D [alpha squadron,
team D] would like to attack Delta B.<br>
<font color="red">League Admin:</font> Very well, the battle has been entered
into the record. Any more?<br>
<font color="red">Alpha Squad Commander:</font> Yes. Alpha B would like to
attack Omega C.<br>
<font color="red">League Admin:</font> Ok. Battle recorded.</p>
<p class="charter">The chat will go on like this until all attacks have been
declared, at which time the games will start. Because each team has two members,
one member will defend the territory against attacks, and the other will attack
an adjacent territory. If the squadron has decided that a team will not make an
attack that week, both members will defend the territory; and if the territory
they are in is not attacked, then the defender(s) will not play that week. This
arrangement will switch each week so everyone gets a chance to play each
position equally.</p>
<p class="charter">If a player is involved in a battle that night, he will go on
the DR2 servers and meet up with his opponent(s). They will chose the map that
has been premade for that territory and fight the battle on that map.</p>
<p class="charter">When the battle has completed, each participant will be
responsible for e-mailing the League Administrator the results of the battle (be
honest, or you will be dissmissed from the league immediately, without
question), the approx. length of time it took, and a short description of it
(for posting on the website). A sample e-mail would look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="multichartexample">Battle: Alpha D attacked Delta B<br>
Attacker: Capt. Power Monger<br>
Defender: Lt. Coward<br>
Winner: Capt. Power Monger<br>
Time (approx): 1 1/2 hrs.</p>
<p class="charterexample">Description:<br>
15 minutes into the game Capt. Monger attacked Lt. Coward's base with about 10
men but was fought off with ease. A little while later Coward tried a sneak
attack on Monger's base but was discovered and wiped out. These attacks went
back and forth for a while, until finally Monger used a three-pronged attack of
45 men and decimated Coward's base.</p>
<p class="charter">After the League Administrator has received all of the
e-mails from the battle participants, the borders on the map will be redrawn,
redivided up, and posted on the website along with all the other relevant
information (battle descriptions, etc.).</p>
<p class="charterhead">Rules and Special Situations</p>
<p class="charter">There are many rules and special situations involving
attacking.</p>
<p>Rules for Attacking:</p>
<p>1) Each team (please note: team, not squadron) may only make one attack per
night.<br>
2) Each team may only attack territories adjacent to their own.</p>
<p>Special Situations:</p>
<p>1) If more than one team attacks the same territory, a multi-player battle
will be fought (i.e. if 2 teams both attack the same territory, a 3 player game
would be fought)<br>
2) If two teams attack each other, then one single four player game will be
fought (not 2 separate two player games).<br>
3) If teams from more than one squadron attacks the same territory, then a
multi-way battle will be fought until only one squadron's team(s) is(are) left
standing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="charterhead">Results of Conquering a Territory</p>
<p class="charter">Unless the conquered territory's attacking team member
manages to conquer a territory, the team is either assimilated into the
conquering squadron or dropped out of the campaign until the next one starts
(their choice). For example, if Alpha 4 attacks Beta 2 and conquers them, the
members of Beta 2 can either drop out of the campaign or join up with Alpha
squadron, unless, the attacking team member of Beta 2 manages to conquer a
territory, then the Beta 2 team is simply relocated.</p>
<p class="charterhead">Rewards of Victory in Battle</p>
<p class="charter">Achieving victory is a big thing in WWIV. So, to reward
people who achieve victory, a ranking system has been developed:</p>
<p class="charterexample">Lieutenant: Received when you join<br>
Captain: 2 victories<br>
Major: 5 victories<br>
Lt. Colonel: 9 victories<br>
Colonel: 13 victories<br>
1 Star General: 18 victories<br>
2 Star General: 25 victories<br>
3 Star General: Squadron Commanders<br>
4 Star General: WWIV staff<br>
5 Star General: League Administrator</p>
<p class="charter">Please note: the ranks of everyone may be reset at any time
by the League Administrator, with the consent of the WWIV staff and Squadron
Commanders. This is so we don't end up with 50 Two Star Generals. Don't worry,
though you'll get a commendation on your dossier (which will be posted on the
WWIV main site) saying what rank you achieved before they were reset.</p>
<p class="charterhead">Rewards and Results of Winning the War</p>
<p class="charter">Everyone in the winning squadron will get a commendation and
a promotion, then the war will start all over again.</p>
