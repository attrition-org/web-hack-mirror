            Walker is the Senior Trainee for the Homeless Program. 
            <p></p>

              of the Back to Care Holistic Health Clinic - the first holistic

              of yoga and a student of human development for 25 years. He is committed 
              to providing opportunities for individuals to participate in the 
              learning process of their own development, and how through holistic 
              living, they impact themselves, their families and their communities.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We either empower ourselves or we give our power to others,&quot; 
              according to Dr. Walker. He is dedicated to bringing holistic health 
              care out of the clinic and into our inner cities. He believes in 
              the practical application of holistic health care and is especially 
              committed to applying his skills to the challenges facing our communities.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Walker is also the founder and Co-Director of H.O.P.E. Institute 
              in Oakland, California. H.O.P.E. Institute is an interdependent 
              learning exchange, employing diverse philosophies and techniques 
              such as metaphysics, religion, yoga, nutrition and leadership development 
              training.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Walker received his B.A. from Columbia College of Communication 
              Arts in Chicago and his Doctoral degree from the Chicago National 
              College of Naprapatics. He has also completed post doctoral work 
              at the Swedish College of Advance Naprapatics in Stockholm, Sweden, 
              as well as advanced Chiropractic and Bioenergetic techniques.<br>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole person development is a way of viewing the past, present 
              and possibly human that exist in each of us. It is a self-observing, 
              self remembering process that invites each of us to develop in a 
              way that benefits the communal environment.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a collective consciousness acknowledges stewardship for the 
              planet and reciprocal honoring of all living things. As we move 
              toward an automation and computer engendered, &quot;worker-less&quot; 
              society the role of educations becomes tantamount to societal success, 
              and perpetuation. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move from a mechanistic paradigm toward a more holoarchically 
              balanced, humanistic culture respectful of each member or the human 
              family, we are taking the next evolutionary step.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 21st Century holds the possibility of a quantum leap for human 
              kind with forward or backward. Wholly developed people will fully 
              participate and advocate forward mobility.</p>
            <p>FAMILY INVOLVEMENT</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development of the Unified Family 
              a series for individuals and groups to become aware of their family 
              history, its importance in economics and health, and especially 
              the role of responsible parenthood.</p>
            <p>COACHING</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coaching is defined by The Coaches 
              Training Institute, is a powerful alliance designed to forward and 
              enhance the lifelong process of human learning, effectiveness and 
              fulfillment. Coaches are trained to assist people in optimizing 
              their performance and deepening their satisfaction in life. Coaches 
              move people from potential to achievement. Coaches are hired by 
              people who desire to be peak performers. In sports, no professional 
              athlete would ever think to compete without using the strategic 
              expertise and perspective of a coach. In business and in various 
              professions, success is often based upon having the support of other 
              person who recognizes your unique employment potential. Coaching 
              is a professional alliance which empowers both personal and professional 
              success.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enlightens the viewer about the relationship of homelessness to 
              public school education.</p>
            <p>UNDERSTANDING </p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Describes the social, emotional, financial, 
            and educational consequences of homelessness from the perspective 
            of families and students who have experienced homelessness. 
            <p>OPPORTUNITY</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outlines positive steps that schools and communities can take to 
              assist students and families without homes from the perspective 
              of parents, students, school personnel, and service providers.</p>
            <p>COLLABORATION</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems surrounding students in homeless situations reach 
              far beyond the walls of the school. These students lack or have 
              minimal access to the basics of life: food, clothing, shelter, health 
              care, bathing facilities. Until these basic needs are satisfied, 
              it is unreasonable to expect students to perform well in school.</p>
            <p>A number of districts across the nation have formed successful 
              partnership with social service agencies, businesses, churches, 
              foundations, service organizations, and volunteer groups to ensure 
              that those basic needs are met. By so doing, schools can get on 
              with their intended purpose: to educate all students to meet their 
              state's challenging performance standards, regardless of the students' 
              living arrangements.</p>
            <p>CARING</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By working together creatively, schools and communities can help 
              to piece the puzzle together one student at a time, one family at 
              a time.</p>
            <p>WHAT YOU GET OUT OF THE TRAINING</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the training, participants should possess 
              the following:</p>
            <p><ul><li> Awareness that their school dna community are likely to have students 
              who are experiencing homelessness</li>
            <li>Knowledge about how people lose their homes </li>
             <li>Understanding of the barriers that prevent students in homeless 
              situations from enrolling, attending, and succeeding in school </li>
             <li>Examples of strategies and practices that school have used to 
              increase the likelihood that students experiencing homelessness 
              will enjoy academic success </li>
             <li>Understanding of way in which schools and communities can collaborate 
              to promote the educational success of students and families without 
              homes</li>
             <li> Knowledge of funding sources that might be used to provide services 
              to students and families in homeless situations</li>
             <li>As list of actions they will take to identify students without 
              homes and deliver quality services to those students.</li></ul></font>
