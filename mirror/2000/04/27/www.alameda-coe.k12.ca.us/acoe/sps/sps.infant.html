  <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Infant Program is an early intervention service for eligible infants
  and toddlers who are birth to three years of age and who are visually,
  hearing, or orthopedically impaired. Infants and toddlers with other types
  of impairments may be eligible for service as well. The Infant Program
  provides specialized services for infants and their families. The program
  focuses on the individual needs and strengths of the infant and on those
  factors which influence their needs and strengths, including the physical
  environment and, most importantly, the family.</font></P>
  <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Parents, infant educators, and specialists (including a nurse speech
  pathologist and infant specialist) meet to collaborate on the development
  of an Individual Family and Student Plan (IFSP) for each infant, which
  is reviewed every six months.</font></P>
  <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Service is available to the infants and the infants' families at three
  locations in Alameda County: North County/Lake Merritt Center in Oakland;
  South County at Burke Center in Hayward, and TriValley Center in Dublin.
  Service is provided to the infant and family through one of two service
  delivery options: home-based services for infants from birth to 18 months
  of age, and center-based services for infants from one to three years of
  age.</font></P>
  <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Infants may be referred to the program by parents, the Regional Center
  of the East Bay, Alameda County Public Health Agency, the medical community,
  school districts, and other infant programs.<BR>
