  <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Student Programs and Services Division operates four Community Day
  Center/Schools-Hayward, Thunder Road, Chabot, and Rock LaFleche. The Community
  Day Center/School is a unique program that provides educational services
  for students ages 12 to 17 who are &quot;at risk&quot; of dropping out
  of school. The program is an alternative &quot;regular&quot; education
  program designed primarily to serve youth who are wards or dependents of
  the court or status offenders (incorrigible) and who are under the supervision
  of the Juvenile Court, Probation Department, or Social Services Agency.</font></P>
  <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The program provides small classrooms staffed with credentialed teachers
  and instructional aides. Each student's academic educational needs are
  assessed and addressed through a self-paced, highly structured, individualized
  instructional program. The students in the program receive supervision
  and counseling services from Probation, Social Services, or community-based
  organizations.</font></P>

  The program serves boys and girls ages 12 to 18 years of age living in
  Alameda County. The minimum stay is one full semester; most students attend
  from four months to one year. The program is governed by a site collaborative
  council composed of three groups-parents/guardians; probation, social services,
  school representatives; community representatives, e.g. major business,
  neighbor, etc. Goals of the program are implemented through a three-tiered
  program design focusing on academics, psychological assistance, and job
  training/college readiness. Referrals to the program are through the Juvenile
  Court, Probation Department, Social Services Agency, youth service centers,
  and school districts.</font></P>

  who are on formal probation. The length of stay depends upon each student's
  progress and may vary from three months to one year. Chabot is administered
  by the Office of Education in cooperation with the Probation and Mental
  Health Departments. In addition to academics, the coeducational program
  focuses on student/family participation and peer behavior management. Referral
  to the program is via the Juvenile Court and an interagency screening team.
  Transition back to the regular school program is through the same screening
  team which includes the following: Chabot CDC and school district staff,
  parent, probation officer, and mental health representatives.</font></P>
