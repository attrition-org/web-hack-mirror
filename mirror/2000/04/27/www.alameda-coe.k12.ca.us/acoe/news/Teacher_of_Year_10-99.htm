  ALAMEDA COUNTY TEACHERS OF THE YEAR</font></P>

          <P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial">&#9;</font><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE=2>Alameda County Superintendent of Schools Sheila Jordan announced the selection of two Alameda County Teachers of the Year for 2000.  The teachers are:  Kami Winding, a high school teacher at James Logan High School in the New Haven School District, and Rebecca Ruiz Radulovich, a kindergarten teacher at the Sunol Glen School in the Sunol Glen School District.</font></P>
          <FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE=2>
          <P>&#9;The names of  both teachers have been sent to the California Department of Education as nominees for state honors.  Those who are selected at the state level are then entered into the National Teacher of the Year competition.  </P>
          <P>&#9;&quot;I think our teachers certainly could go all the way to the National level,&quot; said Jordan.  &quot;Both are exceptionally skilled and creative teachers.  The selection process is always difficult because each nominee is outstanding and represents the best of the teaching profession.&quot;</P>
          <P>&#9;Winding,  who has been a teacher for 13 years,  teaches English and Math at James Logan High School, is described by Principal David Pava as, &quot;an excellent teacher who is committed to the teaching profession and exhibits extraordinary dedication to her students.&quot;</P>
          <P>&#9;In discussing why she became a teacher, Winding said, &quot;I see myself as a bit of an evangelist for good books and the power of reading, for the potential of young people and our responsibilities as educators to develop it.  I want to be the best teacher possible.&quot;</P>
          <P>&#9;Winding is a member of the California Department of Education Curriculum Framework and Criteria Committee for Language Arts and has taught instructional methodology to intern teachers and CSU Hayward student teachers.  She has also played a key role in Logan’s effort to reevaluate and restructure the school language arts program.</P>
          <P>&#9;Radulovich, who shares the Alameda County Teacher of the Year honor,  has been teaching for 23 years.  She is described by  District Superintendent Diane Everett as, &quot;someone who has a very sophisticated level of teaching skills which ensure that no matter what grade level she is teaching, she demonstrates herself to be a master teacher.&quot;</P>
          <P>&#9;A former student Scott Easley, describes Radulovich as, &quot;patient, honest, genuine, understanding, passionate for kids and education, with a smile that conveys silent confirmation.  She is one of the people in life who has given me a leg on which to stand as a person and she is my role model of how to act as a teacher,&quot; said Easley who has just started his first year as a fourth grade teacher. </P>
          <P>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Radulovich has taught from kindergarten through eighth grade at Sunol Glen and has served as a Mentor Teacher, Language Arts Coordinator, Master Teacher and was Sunol’s Teacher of the Year in 1985.</P>
          <P>&#9;In discussing her philosophy of teaching, Radulovich said that, &quot;Teaching is no longer just a matter of providing students with instruction in the skills necessary for success in reading, writing and mathematics.  it is a matter of understanding the uniqueness of each student and providing them with the tools to reach their fullest human potential.&quot;</P>
          <P>&#9;&quot;I have visited every Teacher of the Year,&quot; said Jordan.  &quot;I know first-hand that every one is making a positive difference in the lives of their students, families, colleagues and communities. They model good practice for all of Alameda County teachers. &quot;</P>
          <P>&#9;District and County Teachers of the Year will be honored at a banquet on October 21 at the Claremont Hotel in Oakland.  The nine District Teachers of the Year include:</P>
