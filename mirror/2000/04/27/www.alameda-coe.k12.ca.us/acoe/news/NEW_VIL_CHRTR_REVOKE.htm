          </b></font>
          <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<B>Hayward--</B>Sheila Jordan, Superintendent of Schools, will recommend to the Alameda County Board of Education tonight that it revoke the charter for New Village Charter School.  Jordan has already invoked AB1200 and assumed fiscal control of the school, as authorized by Education Code 42127.6.</font></P>
          <FONT FACE="Palatino,Book Antiqua" SIZE=4>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;In her memorandum to the Board, Jordan said that she was making her recommendation &quot;regretfully,&quot; but she has concerns with both &quot;the educational program and the fiscal management of the school.&quot;</font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fiscal problems include overdrawn accounts and an unbalanced budget; failure to establish measures to avoid overspending; continuing low enrollment and insufficient funding; a continual turnover in staff and board members, resulting in a lack of continuity in policy, procedures, and training; and impending legal action due to unpaid bills for rent, utilities, and maintenance.</font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the school’s educational problems, Jordan sites a lack of cohesive recommendations on program improvement; decisions regarding personnel and program are made by both staff and board, and are often in conflict; the school’s teachers are not properly credentialed; and background checks of certificated staff have not been carried out, including failure to conduct fingerprint checks, as required by the Education Code.</font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jordan said that she is mandated by the Education Code to conduct periodic inspections of charter schools.  &quot;I believe in the charter school movement.  Some charter schools are providing alternative educational opportunities, but occasionally we find a school with serious problems.  My concern, ultimately is for the school’s children and the quality of education they are receiving.&quot; </font></P>
          <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;Jordan said that her office will immediately begin to work closely with parents and students to enroll them in appropriate schools.  &quot;I will do everything I can to ensure that during this transition these families receive all of the understanding and  assistance that they need and deserve.&quot; </font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;Jerome Wiggins, President of the Alameda County Board of Education, said, &quot;The Board and the Superintendent have provided New Village Charter School with many opportunities to succeed. But given the circumstances as outlined by the Superintendent, I believe we have no choice but to concur with the findings and recommendation.&quot; </font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Charter schools offer unprecedented community control of day to day education practices and unique or alternative instructional programs, while still providing support through public funds.  But the charter school is also held more accountable for student success.  &#9;Charter schools operate under five-year charter contracts, which may be renewed if the school meets its performance goals.  California has more than 170 charter schools.</font></P>
