          </font></B>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>HAYWARD</b>—Alameda County Superintendent Sheila Jordan announced today that the California Department of Education has selected the Alameda County Office of Education as the external evaluator for Alameda County schools under the Immediate Intervention – Under-performing Schools Program (II/USP). The program is one of the major provisions of the California Public Schools Accountability Act (PSAA) of 1999.  </font></P>
          <FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE=3>
          <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first step in the implementation of the II/USP was to identify those schools below the 50<SUP>th</SUP> percentile in the Standardized Testing and Reporting Program (STAR) in 1998 and 1999. A total of 1400 schools were identified throughout California, of which 430 will participate in the External Evaluator Program.</font></P>
          <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 353 schools selected for state planning grants will receive $50,000 and be required to contract with the external evaluator to work with the school community to develop a comprehensive needs-assessment and action plan. The list includes 24 elementary, middle, and high schools in eight Alameda County school districts. </font></P>
          <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jordan said today that she was putting &quot;the full resources of the County Office of Education into supporting the efforts of school superintendents working to improve under-performing schools.  We are pleased to be selected, and eager to begin our work with members of our community.&quot; </font></P>
          <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She said that work will begin immediately with community members to establish an Intervention Leadership Committee.  &quot;Its members will be fully representative of our County’s ethnic, linguistic and cultural diversity, and the variety of rolls played by parents, teachers, administrators, students, and concerned citizens,&quot; Jordan added. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;&#9;&#9;</font></P>
          </FONT><FONT SIZE=3></FONT>
          <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is perfect timing.  I said we would reorganize the County Office to provide services in a more coordinated and integrated manner, and that is what we have done.  Significant reform can be accomplished only through well-planned restructuring and the participation of the entire school community,&quot; said Jordan.</font></P>
          <FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE=3>
          <P> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot; We are now ready to reach out to our community of stakeholders and collaborate with them on assessing strengths and needs, and developing goals and an effective plan to substantially improve student academic achievement.&quot;</font></P>
          <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jordan continued, &quot;Accountability to ourselves, the state, and our community is of utmost importance as we begin this new year.  We are going to strengthen and meet our standards for curriculum, teaching, student achievement, and the efficient use of our fiscal resources.&quot;</font></P>
          <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to establishing the Intervention Leadership Committee in coming weeks, the superintendent identified one example of a new program that will assist parents in helping their children learn.  A Parent Resource Center is in the planning stages and funding is being sought.  When it is eventually established, the Parent Resource Center will give parents a place to come together and find resources to learn more about what their children are studying and how to encourage and support them.  For more information on the status of the Parent Resource Center, parents can contact Claire Schooley at the Alameda County Office of Education at (510) 670-4523.</font></P>
