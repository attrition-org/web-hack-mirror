  <P ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Executive Summary</font></P>
  </font></B><FONT FACE="Palatino">
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This report provides an overview 
    of finding from one of the first intensive studies of charter school reform 
    in California, the second state to pass charter school legislation and the 
    state with both the second largest number of charter schools and the most 
    students enrolled in these schools. Charter school reform allows groups of 
    parents, educators, and entrepreneurs to create more independent schools, 
    free from many state and local regulations.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The purpose of this two-and-a-half 
    year study was to examine many of the most prominent claims of charter school 
    advocates against the day-to-day experiences of educators, parents, and students 
    in charter schools as well as in nearby public schools.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We conducted case studies of 17 
    charter schools in 10 school districts across the state. We sampled for diversity 
    at both the district and school level in order to capture the range of experiences 
    within this reform movement.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While charter reform as a public 
    policy tool prescribes no particular school-level practice or singular reform 
    strategy, it is appealing to educators and policy makers due to claims about 
    how charter reform will spur much-needed change throughout the public system.</font></P>

  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Claims about Charter School Reform</font></P>
  </font></u></B><FONT FACE="Palatino">
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Claims about charter school reform 
    include:</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#149; Accountability: Charter 
    schools, more than other public schools, are more accountable for student 
    outcomes; given the threat of having its charter revoked, a charter school 
    will work harder to meet its stated performance goals.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#149; Autonomy and Empowerment: 
    In exchange for greater accountability, charter schools are granted autonomy 
    from the bureaucratic, rule-based public system; empowered by this flexibility, 
    charter school educators will better serve students and families.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#149; Efficiency: Charter schools 
    are more efficient. Freed from bureaucratic demands, charter schools will 
    be able to do more with fewer resources.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#149; Choice: Charter schools 
    provide more choices to more families, particularly those who traditionally 
    have had the fewest choices in the public educational system.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#149; Competition: Charter school 
    reform, by creating a competitive market, will force change in the entire 
    public system.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#149; Models of Innovation: Charter 
    schools are more innovative; creating new models of schooling and serving 
    as laboratories from which other public schools can learn.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The findings that emerged from 
    our investigation of 10 school districts and 17 charter schools across the 
    state shed light on how charter schools&#146; experiences compare to the stated 
    claims of reform advocates. The following are the study&#146;s 15 major findings:</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Finding #1</b></font><b>--</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Charter 
    schools in California are, in most instances, not yet being held accountable 
    for enhanced academic achievement of their students. They are more likely 
    to be held fiscally accountable.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Finding #2</b></font><b>-</b>-<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">School 
    boards are ambivalent about their responsibilities to monitor charter schools; 
    many are reluctant to become involved.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Finding #3</b></font>--<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Charter 
    schools have multiple constituencies to whom they see themselves as accountable.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Finding #4</b></font>--<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Charter 
    schools vary widely in the amount of operating autonomy they need or want 
    and in the demands they make on districts.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Finding #5</b></font>--<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    amount of public funding that charter schools receive for operating expenses 
    ranges widely from one district to the next and even within the same district.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Finding #6</b></font>--<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Private 
    resources are usually necessary for the survival of charter schools.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Finding #7</b></font>--<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Charter 
    schools vary widely in their ability to generate private sources of revenue.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Finding #8</b></font>--<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Charter 
    schools often depend heavily on strong, well-connected leaders.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Finding #9</b></font>--<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Charter 
    schools exercise considerable control over the type of students they serve. 
    Thus, in some cases charter schools have more choice than do parents.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Finding #10</b></font>--<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    requirement that charter schools reflect the racial/ethnic makeup of their 
    districts has not been enforced. Other demographic differences between charter 
    schools and nearby public schools exist and vary by local context.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Finding #11</b></font>--<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Teachers 
    in charter schools value their freedom, relatively small classes, and esprit 
    de corps or collegiality; but heavy workloads are an issue.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Finding #12</b></font>--<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
    not obliged to do so, most charter schools continue to employ teachers with 
    regular state credentials.</font></P>
  <P><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finding #13</font>-</b>-<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Teachers 
    in conversion charter schools continue to belong to teachers unions, but those 
    in start-up schools do not.</font></P>
  <P><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finding #14 </font>-</b>-<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
    are no mechanisms in place for charter schools and regular public schools 
    to learn from each other.</font></P>
  <P><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finding #15</font></b>--<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Public 
    school educators&#146; believe that charter schools have an unfair advantage 
    inhibiting competition.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looking across all of the 15 findings 
    from this study, it is clear that in the majority of cases, the experiences 
    of charter schools do not support the advocates&#146; claims. Claims about 
    greater autonomy leading to greater satisfaction and decision-making capacity 
    are supported, in part, by the data. Most charter schools do tend to have 
    greater autonomy from district and state directives &#150; although the degree 
    varies greatly across schools and districts. However, the simple notion that 
    autonomy in and of itself is a good thing is not supported by the data. Rather 
    we have learned that in many cases charter schools have relied heavily on 
    the support and services available to them through their local districts or 
    other entities.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Similarly, charter school teachers 
    do express a sense of empowerment, derived from their freedom to create smaller, 
    more intimate school communities and their enhanced professional identities. 
    Still, they face difficult working conditions in some cases and wonder how 
    long they can keep up with the pace of work at their schools.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the above-mentioned issues 
    do, in part, support claims made about charter reform, the bulk of our data 
    controverts advocates&#146; claims. For example, the evidence shows charter 
    schools are not more accountable for improving student outcomes than are other 
    public schools in California. This has happened for several reasons; namely, 
    there has been no consistent statewide assessment system in California since 
    the charter school law was passed, charter school founders engage in this 
    reform to accomplish a wide range of goals, charter proposals themselves are 
    often vague regarding specific outcomes, and school district officials often 
    lack information about charter schools&#146; performance and are ambivalent 
    about their responsibilities over charter schools. Unsure how to measure and 
    hold schools accountable for performance, districts tend to monitor charter 
    schools&#146; use of fiscal resources, which is the accountability role they 
    are most likely to play in the regular public system.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Further more, there is no evidence 
    that charter schools can &quot;do more with less.&quot; Rather, much of the 
    evidence illustrates that charter schools rely heavily on supplemental private 
    resources and do what they can to extract a greater share of public dollars. 
    In this way, we see charter school reform at the forefront of efforts to privatize 
    public education, as the reform forces these schools to rely on private funds. 
    The wealth of the local community and the presence of well-connected leaders 
    determine, in many instances, whether a charter school can garner the necessary 
    resources.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On other issues, this study&#146;s 
    data speak to some of the claims about charter reform, not by confirming or 
    disconfirming them, but by reframing the terms of the debate. While advocates 
    claim that charter reform will give parents more choice, our study suggests 
    that the issue is considerably more complicated. We found that charter schools 
    are both the chosen and the chooser. Charter schools have more control than 
    most other public schools in California over who is recruited and who can 
    attend. We learned that charter schools make use of various strategies for 
    choosing parents and students &#150; e.g., targeted recruitment and requirements 
    such as parent or student contracts that dictate what families must give to 
    the school.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While this ability to choose their 
    students and families allows charter schools to create a community identity, 
    which can foster a shared vision for change, our findings raise questions 
    about which parents have the range of choices the charter policy assumes. 
    Without transportation, faced with sometimes demanding parent contracts, and 
    with limited access to information about the practices of charter schools, 
    some parents face serious constraints on any choices they might make. Since 
    charter schools are not held accountable for their success in enrolling a 
    student body that reflects the racial/ethnic make-up of their host district, 
    these facts about charter reform in California suggest that the debate over 
    charter schools and choice is often silent on critical policy questions.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, our data also show 
    that regular public schools in districts with charter schools feel little 
    to no pressure from the charter schools to change the way they do business. 
    In other words, our data do not support the notion that charter reform, via 
    competition, will spur changes in the wider system. In fact, the existence 
    of charter schools may mean that these public schools receive students not 
    accepted at or asked to leave the charter schools, or that they lose their 
    most involved parents to the charters. Furthermore, overcrowding in many California 
    schools hampers the concept of competition for students.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time, we saw that the 
    charter schools we observed, in all but one case, were not serving as models 
    of innovation from which educators in other schools could learn. We found 
    that there were no mechanisms in place for charter schools and regular public 
    schools to learn from each other. Also, there was little communication among 
    the schools, especially in situations in which the charter schools were more 
    independent or when they were established to be in direct competition with 
    the public schools. While we do not have enough data from public schools to 
    draw broad conclusions about the &quot;ripple effects&quot; of charter reform, 
    we do have sufficient data to suggest that charter reform to date has not 
    spurred competition between charters and other public schools, nor have charter 
    schools become models of change and reform throughout the system.</font></P>

  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Implications</font></P>
  </FONT></u></B><FONT FACE="Palatino">
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We draw the following set of public 
    implications from our findings:</font></P>
  </FONT> 
  <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#149; If charter schools are 
    to be held accountable, a new system of accountability must be devised. Such 
    a system must be broader and more comprehensive than a single standardized 
    test, recognize the range of academic and non-academic goals of charter school 
    operators, and balance these goals against the public&#146;s need to know 
    how these more independent schools are spending tax dollars. </font></P>
  <FONT FACE="Palatino">
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, charter school petitioners 
    should be required to be more specific about their goals and intended outcomes 
    in their charter proposals. This information should be made public so that 
    charter schools are accountable to taxpayers and voters. And finally, the 
    measure of academic achievement of students in charter schools should be longitudinal 
    and not one-shot test scores compared to the public school down the street. 
    The self-selection bias inherent in charter schools or any school of choice 
    needs to be factored into analyses of charter school accountability.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#149; It is time to rest the fired 
    rhetoric that all bureaucracy is bad and all autonomy from bureaucracy is 
    good. </font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are many charter schools 
    in California that could not exist without the ongoing support of their local 
    school districts. In fact, policy makers and educators have a lot to learn 
    from charter school operators about which aspects of autonomy are most important 
    &#150; e.g., the freedom to hire teachers &#150; and which aspects of the 
    bureaucracy are most supportive. Our data suggest there will not be a lot 
    of agreement across charter schools on these particular aspects, but more 
    information on this issue could help frame future debates about how to provide 
    public schools with more autonomy while maintaining supportive bureaucracies.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#149; To the extent that charter 
    school reform is going to provide students and communities most in need with 
    better educational programs, federal and state funding for charter schools 
    should be targeted to low-income communities that lack corporate sponsorship 
    to start charter schools. Furthermore, information about charter school funding 
    sources should be disseminated broadly so that the long-term implications 
    of privatization of public education through charter school reform can be 
    publicly debated.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#149; If a central goal of charter 
    school reform is to provide more choice to parents who have had the fewest 
    options, our data suggest that charter schools have too much choice over who 
    attends. In order to assure more parental choice, information about charter 
    schools must be disseminated broadly and the ability of charter schools to 
    maintain stricter discipline codes and mandatory parental involvement contracts 
    must be curtailed.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, states and districts 
    would need to provide transportation for students who choose charter schools 
    but lack the means to get to them.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#149; Political rhetoric about 
    competition as a force to improve education is empty in places where overcrowding 
    is an issue. Furthermore, educators who feel they are being asked to compete 
    on an uneven playing field are less likely to respond to competitive forces 
    in the manner that economic theory would suggest. Thus, any policy that tries 
    to infuse competition into public education should take these two issues into 
    account.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#149; If charter schools and regular 
    public schools are going to learn from each other, districts or states will 
    need to help facilitate this interaction. Bringing educators from the different 
    sectors together to share information would be a first step. Also, framing 
    charter school reform as a collaborative, as opposed to competitive, reform 
    movement would help.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#149; Further research is needed 
    on charter schools, especially research on equity, access, resources, accountability, 
    impact on the public system, and classroom practices.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For all the excitement and satisfaction 
    that this reform has brought to communities able to sustain viable charter 
    schools, the charter school reform movement, at least in California, has failed 
    to live up to many of the claims put forth by its proponents. Furthermore, 
    the debate over charter schools and choice is often silent on critical policy 
    questions related to equity and access for students. We argue that it is time 
    to reassess this &quot;magic bullet&quot; of school reform and to raise harder 
    questions about equity.</font></P>
