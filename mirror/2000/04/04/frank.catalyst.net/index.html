<!-- MrYowler.. I see you are something of a computer forensics guy.
Here's something of a chronology to assist you with your "professional
security career". Forgive me for not being up to your standards, as I am
just a tumultuous script kid with some dot-slash cracking skills. 

March
-----
*) BIND 8.2/8.2.1 remote NXT exploit with private modifications to descriptor
locking code, and removing the crippled aspect of the shellcode. Messy, 
but it worked. Yay.

April
-----
*) rpc.amd remote exploit. Minor offset mods, but basically script kid
technique. Nothing special.

<p align="justify">Sorry MrYowler, but you have been owned again by #parse.
Not because of any personal vendetta against you, or your rather interesting
multi-threaded webserver, but because of your loudmouthed friend Tara who
can't keep her mouth shut. She claims that we at #parse didn't own you last
time. She claims that Vince did it.  So, basically, this is a big REST
YOUR NECK to all you unbelievers, and a living testament to the extreme
digital kung-fu that is #parse.

<div align="justify"> 
We have done it again, regardless of your futile attempts to secure your box.
This time, please give credit where credit is due instead of making silly
excuses {"I decreased the security of my box on purpose"}, and BOW DOWN TO A
POWER GREATER THAN YOURSELF!!</div>
