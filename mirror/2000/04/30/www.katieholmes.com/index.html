<TITLE>All About Love</TITLE>
<center>
Dear Adam,<BR>
<BR>
Into love and out again,<BR>
        Thus I went and thus I go.<BR>
Spare your voice, and hold your pen:<BR>
        Well and bitterly I know<BR>
All the songs were ever sung,<BR>
        All the words were ever said;<BR>
Could it be, when I was young,<BR>
        Someone dropped me on my head?<BR>
                -- Dorothy Parker, "Theory"<BR>
