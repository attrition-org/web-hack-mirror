<font color = "yellow"><p> Falling further away from reality i seem to get along better with 
the artifical. It never talks back, never makes you cry, and for once in 
your life you actually think that maybe a man-made invention is more human
than the person who created it. Everything around you fades away and yur
eyes get buried into a place you can finally call your own. You invest your
time, your patience, your money, and soon enough, you invest your life into
something that evolves with time and you evolve with it. Experimenting every
possibility. Craving to understand how to use your artificial friend as not
only a tool, but a weapon. You remember all those dumbshits at your school,
the people that were just too good? More like too fake. They live an empty
life persuing a lifetime career out of fast food management, while you have
bigger ideas in your mind. You don't want to go to school. You are more 
focused on how to use the latest wu-ftpd sploit. So you fall asleep in class
coz you were up the night before giving back to the bullshit world a few
ICMP packets. Soon enough, you will realize that no matter how much you try,
you can't win. Not by yourself anyways. The government despies your actions.
Not because you renamed a fucking .html, but because they are fucking worried
that you understand something they don't. And that my friends, is a fuckin
national security breach. Hackers are simply a creation of just one of the 
many, many, many government experiments. Mutants of the technology revolution.
But, you continue to feed your hunger. Your thirst. Your craving. But you still
deny your addiction to the face of reality. Hoping some sort of "nicotine patch"
f0r haX0rs will stabilize you. But not even heroine can give you the rush that 
compromising a system gives us. Welcome to our reality. Enter at your own risk.

She is looking for Mr. Right. Too many ppl fuckin take advantage of her. Ppl
thank that just coz she gotz hair on her chest and an incredibly large 
rumpel-foreskin, that that can take advantage of her and just have seX0r with
her. But listen fuqnutz! my sissy isn't that type of girl! You can't just take her 
out to fuckin Burger King and think she will put out. But I don't want to discourage
you. I mean, if you get her a 99 cent whopper and put some cheeze on it, she may 
give you sometan. She gave her first date some tongue. She gave her second date some
head. And she gave her 3rd date some herpes. So, hey, if yur interested in sEx0riNg
