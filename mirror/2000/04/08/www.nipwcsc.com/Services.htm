                services based on the synergy of our total client
                base. Because every customer's needs are unique,
                we design unique solutions. As a non-asset based
                carrier, we have the flexibility to utilise each
                carrier's service strengths without making
                decisions biased by typical in-house concerns
                about load factors and operating ratios. <p>NIPWCS
                Co. is a management organisation with objectives
                to reduce client's costs while improving service,
                using consolidation and back-haul programs, and
                taking advantage of each carrier's unique
                characteristics. Each carrier's cost and
                performance is measured and reported monthly for
                better control and service improvement. This
                approach to freight management has saved our
                clients up to 35% of their annual costs while
                achieving on-time shipment performance of up to
                99%. For many clients, NIPWCS Co. <b>is</b> their
