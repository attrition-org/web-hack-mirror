wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Internet may be known as the information
superhighway, but for many collectors, it has become another method to search for specific
items for their collections. Granted, it doesn't have the charm of digging around at your
local flea market or the rush brought on by flashing your buyers number at a farm auction,
but if you really want to find that certain something, there's bound to be one for sale on
the Internet. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think of the various collections you've seen --
Uncle Bob's collection of barbed wire, Aunt Gertie's Brown Betty teapots or your mother's
collection of the jokers from playing card decks -- you name it, people collect it. <br
wp="br2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past collectors had to travel. Now they
can search the world from their computer. They may choose to buy from antique
&quot;shops&quot; online or bid in online auctions to find their items. And they can do so
safely. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<big><strong>What's out there</strong> </big><br wp="br1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many web sites where collectors can
get a sense of what's available online and what price collectibles bring. One excellent
site is www.collectit.net. Operated by Krause Publications, a publisher of antique and
collectible periodicals, this site is easy to navigate and boasts a 20,000-item list of
classifieds items. <br wp="br2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At www.collectoronline.com, you'll feel like
you're walking through a flea market with hundreds of vendors as you search for your
favorite goodies. The site has a news release section which tells you what's happening in
the world of collectors, a club section with links to places such as Steiff bears or even
milk bottle collectors clubs. Even those rowdy toothpick holder collectors have a site. <br
wp="br1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collector Online has more than 800 contacts for
specific collectibles. You may browse through the photo antique mall or look through their
entire inventory. You can even send the dealers request so they can contact you when they
have an item in your line of interest. Keep in mind theses prices are set by the dealers
who offer them, so there's no bidding like on online auctions. <br wp="br1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep up with what collectors are buying,
check out www.tias.com. Each month this site posts the top 20 most popular antiques and
collectibles. Last month cooking jars, Avon bottles, Roseville glassware, lamps and
Noritake china topped the list. Tias, like Collector Online, is a site where those who
want to shop without bidding in auctions can go. They offer more than 220 reputable online
antique and collectible shops for your hunting pleasure and carry nearly 161,000 items for
sale. Tias also offers you a free online price guide. <br wp="br1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What's it worth?&quot; is the most common
question asked by collectors and www.kovels.com has 250,000 items listed. They also offer
a free electronic newsletter which keeps you posted on what's hot on their site. <br
wp="br1">
<strong><br>
<big>Online auction sites</strong> </big><br wp="br1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're a collector who doesn't mind taking
chances, then www.ebay.com is the site for you. After you register on Ebay, you search for
specific items, and if you find one you're interested in, you place a bid. Most sellers
post a photograph of their item on the page so you can see what you're bidding on.
Remember, read carefully and ask the seller any questions you have before you bid on an
item. <br wp="br1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An auction usually lasts three to seven days
and at its close, both the highest bidder and seller are notified by e-mail. If you win
the bid, you'll be sending your payment directly to the seller. Each seller specifies what
type of payment they accept and how much you need to add for shipping and handling. <br
wp="br1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now all you need is the patience to wait for
the item to arrive in your mailbox. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want, you can leave a high bid for the
item you're trying to win. Bids usually go up increments of 25 cents to a dollar, although
that amount is set by the seller. If someone bids on the same item, but your high bid
beats their current bid, you still stand a chance of winning the item you want. Ebay will
alert you by e-mail if your bid has been topped, giving you chance to counter the offer. <br
wp="br1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ebay says it averages 375,000 auctions daily,
with nearly half a million items for sale in more than 840 categories. The world seems
very small when bidding on Ebay, since you might buy your collectible from someone in
Scotland, Japan or some other distant locale. <br wp="br1">
<strong><br>
<big>Online safety</strong> </big><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now that you know where to hunt down that
old fishing reel or doll to add to your collection, how do you go about purchasing that
item safely online? <br wp="br1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When making any purchase whether online or off,
it's still caveat emptor, let the buyer beware. Do your homework. However you shop in real
life is how you should buy online. The National Consumers League offers a myriad of tips
on being a wise e-shopper: <br wp="br1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- Understand how the auction works. Read the details of each auction before jumping in
and bidding blindly. <br wp="br1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- Check the seller out. Look at the auction site's feedback section for comments about
the seller. But also be aware that simply because that seller might have a glowing report
doesn't mean they are trustworthy. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- Be wary of claims about collectibles. Since you can't examine the item or have it
appraised until after the sale, you can't assume that claims made about it are valid.
Insist, when needed, on getting a written statement describing the item and its value
before you pay. <br wp="br1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- Pay the safest way. Requests for cash are a clear sign of fraud. If possible, pay by
credit card because you can dispute the charges if the goods are misrepresented or never
arrive. You may also choose to pay by check made out directly to a specific person or
store so you can stop payment if necessary. (For a fee, Ebay offers an escrow service,
holding your payment until you receive and accept the item from the seller. Details are
available on the site.) <br wp="br1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- Let the auction site know if you have a problem. Some sites investigate problems like
&quot;shills&quot; (people who bid prices up without planning to buy the item) or other
abuses of the auction system. They may also want to know about sellers who don't deliver
or misrepresent their wares. A bad record may result in a seller being barred from using
the site. <br>
You can be safe and still have fun as you search for that elusive collectible item for
your collection. If you pay attention to the details and ask questions, you won't end up
receiving a once collectible but now patched guitar because you didn't take time to read
the description carefully. <br>
