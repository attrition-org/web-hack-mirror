    Rains Natural Meats offers you wholesome meat cuts that are antibiotic and hormone free.
    We raise our own livestock; our animals do not receive growth producing hormones. We raise
    our own livestock to a standard above commercial feeders. These are the animals that also
    feed our families and <u><em><strong>that</strong></em></u> is why we are more selective
    in our breeding programs and our meat quality. There is documentation showing that
    hormones placed in animals can and are ingested into the human digestive system and can
    cause human health problems.<p><big><big><strong><em>What can we do for you?</em></strong></big></big><br>
    Rains Natural Meats prides itself on providing an antibiotic and hormone free meat that
    you can order the way you like it. Have you ever wanted a juicy inch-and-a-half T-bone
    steak? Well, at Rains Natural Meats we cut to your order. We are a USDA inspected
    processing plant which makes us capable of providing any special cuts or sizes of meat
    that you could possibly desire. Your wish is our command.</p>
