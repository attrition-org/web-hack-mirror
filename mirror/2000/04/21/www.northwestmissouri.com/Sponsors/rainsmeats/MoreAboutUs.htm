    Rains Natural Meats, located 3 miles east of Gallatin on Highway 6, is where fresh family
    farm meat is raised the old-fashioned way, through techniques of genuine animal husbandry.
    </p>
    <p>&quot;We raise our meat the way we would if we were going to eat it ourselves,&quot;
    says David Rains, &quot;because we do!&quot; </p>
    <p>The USDA allows the &quot;Natural&quot; label on meat that fits the following standard:
    &quot;During processing nothing synthetic is ever added to the meat, including
    preservative, and the product is only minimally processed.&quot; For the consumer,
    &quot;Natural&quot; means the animals are raised without hormone growth implants,
    pesticides, animal by-products or digestive stimulants. </p>
    <p>&quot;Baby pigs are treated for scours,&quot; says David. &quot;After that, any animal
    requiring antibiotics is removed from the herd, treated, and sold on the open market, not
    in the store.&quot; </p>
    <p>The animals are raised in humane and healthy conditions as opposed to the factory
    farming techniques that became popular after World War II. David and Steve Rains have some
    140 cattle plus another 30 raised by Steve's son, Lance. The cattle are a 3-way cross of
    Angus Shorthorn and moderate-frame Black Simmental. The Angus are noted for quality, the
    Simmental for muscle tone. The cattle are free-roaming in pastures located around Lake
    Viking, Magill and north of Highway 13. </p>
    <p>&quot;We have cattle strung out all over Daviess County,&quot; says David. The cattle
    have fresh air 24 hours a day and can come and go from barns as they will, rather than
    being confined to a feedlot. Free-ranging animals get more exercise, so they have firmer
    muscle texture. Animals aren't stressed; they don't have the adrenaline rushes through
    their bodies that cause muscles to toughen and darken. The feed is all natural. The cattle
    are summer fed on grass, clover and high-quality grains. They are winter fed on corn and
    hay. The Rains' grow most of their grain themselves. </p>
    <p>&quot;Our cattle have free choice of hay or grass every day of their lives,&quot; says
    David. He notes that there is documented proof that roughage is important in bringing down
    the outbreak of E-coli. A steady supply of roughage is something lacking in some big,
    commercial lots. </p>
    <p>The Rains' raise Tamworth pork because of the exceptional quality of the meat. The pork
    is raised to a slaughter weight of 250 plus pounds. Like cattle, the hogs receive more
    space, cleaner bedding, better food and more attention to their health. <br>

    <p><font face="Arial Black" color="#008040"><big>A meat market on the family farm</big></font><br>
    Building a meat market on the family farm was no small decision. For over 3 years the idea
    was a dinner table discussion. Then the idea was put before a professor of Food Service
    and Nutrition at the University of Missouri-Columbia which led to encouragement and
    referral to the Small Business Development Program at the university. </p>
    <p>Market studies and customer surveys were conducted, which indicated a growing number of
    conscientious consumers who have changed eating habits as a result of reports on
    pesticides and food chemical danger. According to a report in the March 1997 NFM, 85% of
    consumers believe antibiotics pose a potential health hazard. </p>
    <p>The Rains brothers worked with the USDA from the start of their business and received
    full certification and label approval in November, 1998. </p>
    <p>The Rains' work constantly to assure their meat plant meets all USDA requirements. The
    inside of the building is clean and spacious with a homey feel. Red-stained boards from an
    old barn the family tore down make up one partition. A large cooler and a freezer are
    located in the back. The upstairs has a room for the USDA inspector, a dry storage room
    and offices. The meat-cutting plant doesn't have the usual noises and smells of a butcher
    plant. Thomas Meats at Ridgeway, Mo., performs the butchering and also smoke-cures the
    meat.</p>
    <p>The meat-cutting equipment in the Rains' building is torn down and cleaned daily as
    floors are scrubbed and disinfected. Except for hamburger and sausage, the meat is
    cryo-vacuumed packed. This latest high-tech process preserves freshness and adds to the
    product's shelf life. With this type of packaging, the meat is best thawed in a bowl of
    hot water, rather than the microwave. It's just as quick. </p>
    <p>&quot;Our hamburger is out of fat cattle, not out of bulls,&quot; says David. Rains'
    beef is aged for tenderness and flavor. Aged beef is hung for 14 days in a controlled,
    refrigerated environment. Aging allows natural enzymes to break down fibers. Aged beef is
    not as bright red as conventional store-bought beef, yet the Rains' claim the difference
    in quality becomes apparent when it is tasted. </p>
    <p>Beef and pork are available fresh or frozen. Customers can buy by the cut, box or side.
    Your meat can be cut in any way you direct. The Rains' also offer sausage and bacon.
    Because the animals are allowed to grow up slowly and leisurely, at their natural pace,
    Rains Natural Meats costs more to produce. They still try to keep prices reasonable; but
    taste is the No. 1 reason consumers buy their products. </p>
    <p>&quot;Everything we do is directed to providing the highest quality, not to producing
    the cheapest meat,&quot; David says. Rains Natural Meats is a family-owned business.
    Everybody pitches in, including sister Vickie; dad Don; Steve's wife Reta and their
    children, Lance and Lisa; and David's wife, Julie, and their children, Hattie and Riley.
    Gerald McBrayer, who ran his own beef and pork processing plant for 18 years, is head meat
    cutter. Others who help are Delores Place and Torry Stith.</p>
