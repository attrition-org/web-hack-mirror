    cooperative?&nbsp; </font></strong></em></big>Like all cooperatives, new generation
    cooperatives are producer-owned and controlled. Unlike traditional co-ops with their open
    memberships, new generation cooperatives have a defined membership that's linked to the
    optimal capacity of the processing plant.<p><big><strong><em><font color="#008000">How
    will farmers participate?&nbsp; </font></em></strong></big>Producers will buy stocks in
    the cooperative up front. They participate by having a responsibility to deliver the
    quantity of soybeans that represent their ownership in the plant. For example, if a
    producer owns 5,000 shares of stock, the producer must deliver 5,000 bushels of soybeans
    to the processing plant during the processing year. The producer receives a dividend at
    the end of the year based on the profitability of the plant and his percentage of
    ownership.</p>
    <p><font color="#008000"><big><strong><em>What will be the farmers' investment?&nbsp; </em></strong></big></font>Assuming
    the producers have full ownership of the plant, their combined investment would be 40
    percent of the capital cost to construct and start-up the plant. If the capital cost is
    $22.5 million then their investment would be $9 million. The remaining $13.5 million would
    be financed. Based on the 9 million bushel capacity of the processing plant, the farmer's
    investment would be $1 per bushel.</p>
    <p><big><font color="#008000"><em><strong>Who will run this new generation cooperative?
    &nbsp; </strong></em></font></big>Farmers will be in charge of the decisions for the
    cooperative. They will elect a board of directors. The board will hire a company to be
    responsible for the construction, start-up and day-to-day management of the cooperative.</p>
    <p><font color="#008000"><big><em><strong>What will be the location?&nbsp; </strong></em></big></font>The
    actual site of the plant has not yet been selected. The feasibility study indicates the
    ideal location would be near Chillicothe, Mo.</p>
    <p><font color="#008000"><big><em><strong>What will be the price advantage for local
    soybean growers?&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></em></big></font>The primary cost advantage to
    producers will be reduced transportation costs to the processing plant. This could be as
    much as a $.05-$.15 per bushel increase in price.</p>
    <p><font color="#008000"><em><strong><big>What will be the primary market for the
    soybeans?&nbsp; </big></strong></em></font>The primary market for soybean meal will be
    local livestock feed mills. The soybean oil will be marketed to refiners in the Midwest.</p>
    <p><font color="#008000"><em><strong><big>How will this plant compete with other plants?
    &nbsp; </big></strong></em></font>The primary method of competition with other processors
    will be the development of niche markets for identity-preserved soybean products. The
    processing of identity-preserved soybeans in existing large processing plants is
    difficult. The disruption of the continuous process used in these large plants makes small
    quantities of identity-preserved soybeans costly to process.</p>
    <p><font color="#008000"><em><strong><big>How will the plant handle identity-preserved
    soybeans?&nbsp; </big></strong></em></font>The processing plant is designed for processing
    both commodity soybeans and identity-preserved soybeans. Because of the new design, it
    will take less than one hour to change between one type of soybeans to another. In current
    plants it can take days to switch between one identity-preserved product to another.</p>
    <p><font color="#008000"><big><em><strong>How many bushels of soybeans will the plant use
    each year?&nbsp; </strong></em></big></font>The plant is designed to process 9 million
    bushels a year. That is based on processing 26,667 bushels per day for an average of 337
    days per year of processing time and 28 days of downtime.</p>
    <p><big><font color="#008000"><em><strong>What is the time line?&nbsp; </strong></em></font></big>A
    producer education campaign will take place through the fall of 1999. A board of directors
    will be selected from soybean producers interested in leading the project. As early as
    harvest 1999, the group could begin soliciting for memberships. After the membership
    soliciting ends, the plant construction will begin. It will take approximately 14 months
    to complete the plant once construction starts.</p>
