    <td width="100%"><!--mstheme--><font face="arial, helvetica">The purpose of the Missouri Agricultural and Small Business Development
    Authority is to promote the development of agriculture and small businesses. To help
    achieve this objective, the authority administers the Missouri Value-Added Program, which
    has two components: a grant program and a loan guarantee program. Both are intended to
    benefit Missouri producers by helping establish enterprise to add value to agricultural
    products. This could be through creating new uses, new markets or further processing of
    agricultural goods, such as crops and livestock. Rural communities and indeed all
    Missourians stand to benefit from the increased economic activity that comes with
    processing, manufacturing or other value-added activities that create and retain jobs.<p><font color="#008000"><strong><big>Missouri Value-Added Grant Program</big></strong></font><br>
    The Missouri Value-Added Grant Program provides grants for projects that boost local
    economics by adding value to agricultural products. The maximum individual grant is
    $150,000. However, one-third of the available funds will be awarded to project requests of
    $25,000 or less. The grants are intended to finance activities prior to starting or
    expanding a business, such as feasibility studies, prospectus development for cooperatives
    and business and marketing plans. They cannot be used for operational or capital
    expenditures. In short, the grants will help identify opportunities and niche markets to
    better ensure successful enterprises and help get projects to a bankable stage.
    Agricultural products are defined as an agricultural, horticultural, viticultural, or
    vegetable product, growing of grapes that will be processed into wine, bees, honey, fish
    or other aquacultural product, planting, seed, livestock, a livestock product, a forestry
    product, poultry or poultry product, either in its natural or processed state, that has
    been produced, processed, or otherwise had value added to it in Missouri.</p>
    <p><font color="#008000"><big><strong>Evaluation and Funding Criteria</strong></big></font><br>
    Proposals will be selected on a competitive basis. Each proposal will be evaluated and
    rated using the following criteria:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>agriculture economic development potential;</li>
      <li>credibility and merit;</li>
      <li>probability of near-term commercialization and practical application of project results;</li>
      <li>presence, source and level of matching funds; and</li>
      <li>where the project will have an economic impact.<br WP="BR1">
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><big><strong><font color="#008000">Eligibility Requirements</font></strong></big><br>
    Applicants must be at least 18 years old and Missouri residents, groups of individuals,
    businesses, and organizations related to agriculture whose proposed project is based in
    Missouri. Eligible applicants must use grant funds directly or subcontract with a public
    or private organization or other resource to achieve the grant proposal objectives. A
    proposed project must be located in Missouri, must add value to an agricultural product
    and must benefit the economy of a rural community. Proposals and anticipated project
    results must have potential for direct commercial application.</p>
    <p><big><strong><font color="#008000">Restrictions</font></strong></big><br>
    The program does not fund:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>business start-up;</li>
      <li>business expansion, unless qualified on the basis of program criteria; </li>
      <li>paying off existing debt;</li>
      <li>substituting existing efforts or research already underway;</li>
      <li>covering institutional overhead costs; or</li>
      <li>buying land, buildings or equipment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><big><strong><font color="#008000">Application Requirements</font></strong></big><br>
    The application should provide evaluators with a written statement describing an activity
    that has a sound approach and merits financial support. Applications will be judged
    principally on how they conform to the grant objectives and criteria, as well as on cost
    effectiveness. Applications should be no more than 20 pages long (including all
    supplements) and should conform to the format described on the application form.</p>
    <p><font color="#008000"><big><strong>Missouri Value-Added Loan Guarantee Program</strong></big></font><br>
    The Missouri Value-Added Loan Guarantee Program provides partial loan guarantees to banks,
    savings and loans, and Farm Credit system lenders. Under the program, lenders can receive
    a 25 percent first-loss guarantee on loans up to $250,000 that finance projects involved
    in processing, manufacturing, marketing, exporting, or adding value to agricultural
    products. Loans can be used to finance agricultural property, which includes land,
    building, structures, improvements, and equipment. Loans may also be guaranteed to buy
    stock in a start-up cooperative that processes an agricultural product. Loan proceeds may
    not be used for a line of credit, working capital, or producing livestock or agricultural
    crops, except for plant stock used for growing grapes that will be processed into wine.</p>
    <p><font color="#008000"><big><strong>Eligibility Requirements</strong></big></font><br>
    A borrower may be an individual, partnership, corporation, firm, cooperative, association,
    trust, political subdivision, state agency or other legal entity executing a note or other
    evidence of an agricultural business development loan. If an individual , the borrower
    must be at least 18 years old and a Missouri resident. Any agricultural property financed
    must be located in Missouri and used by state residents or by Missouri-based businesses.
    The program is intended to create new economic activity by creating or retaining jobs.
    Financed projects must demonstrate a good likelihood to succeed in developing, expanding,
    and operating business enterprises involved in adding value to, marketing, exporting,
    processing, or manufacturing agricultural products. <u>No more than 90 percent of a
    project may be financed.</u> Eligible borrowers may also qualify for reduced interest
    rates through the MISSOURI FIRST Linked Deposit Program administered by the state
    treasurer's office. For more information about the MISSOURI FIRST Linked Deposit Program,
    call (800) 662-8257.</p>
    <p><font color="#008000"><big><strong>Making Loans</strong></big></font><br>
    Borrowers wishing to secure a loan through the loan guarantee program must apply for a
    loan through a bank, savings and loan association, the Farm Credit System or other
    eligible lender. A participating lender must decide whether a prospective borrower meets
    its requirements for a loan if a 25 percent first-loss guarantee is provided through the
    Missouri Value-Added Loan Guarantee Program.</p>
