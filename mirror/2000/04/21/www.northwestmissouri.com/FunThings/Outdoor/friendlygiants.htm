    Missouri</strong> </big></big></big></font><p>Giant Canada geese are Missouri friendly,
    even nick-named &quot;Friendly Giants,&quot; however they've taken messy advantage of
    their invitations to our state wildlife ranks. Reckon we in Northwest Missouri get both
    fame and blame as our part of the state launched the Giant Canada restoration story, a
    saga that has become almost too much of a success. </p>
    <p>The largest of several species of Canada goose, easily identified by white cheek
    patches, Giant Canadas were thought back in the early 1950's to have vanished from
    Missouri wildlife parade. </p>
    <p>Now, as the Missouri Conservation Department project nears a bicentennial birthday,
    efforts are underway to slow the Giant Canada baby boom to a tolerable pace. <br wp="br1">
    <br>
    Giant honks are familiar in our area. Nearby Pony Express Conservation Area and Smithville
    Lake were original Friendly Giant country and remain Giant strong-holds. <br wp="br1">
    <br>
    Missouri wildlife managers figured the big geese were gone from state Canada goose ranks
    in the early 50's, but eventually found a few and restored Giant populations by moving
    geese to new locations throughout the state as the flocks gradually expanded. <br wp="br1">
    <br>
    Giant Canadas are now familiar sights on large lakes and most farm ponds. The birds seem
    to enjoy human company, however many folks don't return the compliment. <br wp="br2">
    <br>
    The wild geese are unsanitary and considered nuisances in some areas, where they mess up
    shorelines, fishing and picnic areas, even invade golf courses for meals of choice grass. <br wp="br1">
    <br>
    Some areas have been opened to hunting as a control measure and further studies are being
    done in hopes of keeping the friendly birds at tolerable numbers and aiding landowners in
    keeping geese at a tolerable distance. <br wp="br1">
    <br>
    Northwest Missouri was the start of the Canada restoration project and continues to be
    prime Canada home territory. <br wp="br1">
    <br>
    Wildlife managers located about two dozen giants in 1952. Today there are an estimated
    35,000 to 50,000 birds throughout the state. The two dozen founding fathers and mothers
    were acquired by the Missouri Conservation Department from private owners to form the
    nucleus of a restoration program. </p>
    <p>The history of those 24 birds isn't recorded. They may have been wild birds used as
    hunting decoys when such live bait was legal. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    The birds were wing-clipped to keep them grounded at the former Trimble Wildlife Area, now
    a part of Smithville Lake and located about 40 miles southeast of Maysville. The flock
    expanded with use of elevated metal tubs as protected nesting sites, shielded by
    no-hunting regulations and good habitat, food, water and cover, at the wildlife area. <br wp="br1">
    <br>
    Nesting tubs tacked to posts provided height protection for hatching eggs. Ground nests
    are easy prey for raccoons, foxes, skunks and other predators. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    Youngsters from the original flock were first transferred to other state areas. Those
    satellite flocks in turn furnished goslings for further expansion to conservation areas
    and private lands. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    Among the first state sites to receive Trimble geese was Pony Express Conservation Area.
    Pony was a natural selection as the state conservation department area is only a few air
    miles from the Trimble area. </p>
    <p>Perhaps the distance was too close to their Trimble home as the initial stocking at
    pony Express flew back to Trimble. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    Pony Express then was stocked with geese from the Busch Conservation Area near St. Louis.
    Those birds stayed, even though they also originally were Trimble geese. Flocks at Pony
    expanded until Pony eventually became the prime source of Canadas for launching flocks at
    other state sites and some private lands. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    Northwest Missouri remains the stronghold of giants. &quot;From Kansas City northward to
    Smithville Reservoir and on to Pony Express Conservation Area is the stronghold of state
    geese numbers,&quot; said Dave Graber, waterfowl research biologist for the Missouri
    Department of Conservation. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    &quot;Pastures, crops and ample ponds provide habitat most favorable to geese in those
    sited,&quot; he explained. </p>
    <p>Pony Express also furnished goslings to Kansas in return for Sunflower state prairie
    chickens, released in Missouri to restore that bird to our state. Kansas elected to wind
    down the Giant Canada project in 1995. Missouri conservation wildlife swappers most likely
    will find new trading grounds. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    Pony Express leads the state during annual roundups when geese are herded into shore pens
    for research data, such as checking or adding leg bands, compiling numbers, determining
    sex and ages. </p>
    <p>More than 2,000 giants were checked during one Pony Express roundup, one of about ten
    such annual sessions usually conducted in late June when geese are flightless. Adult birds
    are replacing flight feathers while youngsters are growing flight feathers. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    Roundups resemble scenes from the old cattle roundups. Geese are herded from shore into
    the water, where boats take over the drive. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    Boat motors roar as experienced &quot;water cowboys and girls&quot; skim around the geese,
    maneuvering the birds into a large flock. Whistles, yells and boat oars slapped on the
    lake help guide Canada mavericks back in line when the birds attempt to break away from
    the main flock. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    Several dozen usually escape -- some have replaced flight feathers or are wise old
    veterans -- but the majority are gradually herded back to a shady shore area and large
    temporary holding pens. </p>
    <p>Then the real work starts. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    Geese are captured, usually by pinning the wings, for research and then released back to
    the lake. Care is taken to cause as little stress as possible to the birds. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    Some geese cooperate. Others scratch and nip. The birds can rake skin to the bone, deliver
    wing whacks and do a twisting bite that tends to make goose catchers momentarily loose
    their religion. Pony Express Conservation Area is home to a year-around flock of several
    hundred, which grows to the 2,000 range in the spring. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    &quot;Although some birds nest at Pony Express, the majority of birds at roundup time are
    those using the site as a molting area,&quot; Research Biologist Graber said. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    Most goslings are hatched at smaller lakes and ponds, especially those with elevated tub
    nests or islands serving as protection from predators, he explained. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    &quot;A couple days after hatching, young birds and their parents move overland, seeking
    larger water and good grass. They only move a few miles, so those birds hatched close to
    Pony Express will move to that area. Those beyond a few miles will seek other large water
    sites. We put small transmitters on some geese in hopes of finding out how far they range
    after hatching. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    &quot;Family groups will stay together about a year, then young birds will be banished as
    adults defend mating territory. Those non-breeding birds are the majority gathered at Pony
    Express, where they assemble for molting.&quot; <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    Missouri's restoration project was pronounced a success a few years ago with the giants
    back to Missouri in full force -- plenty strong to provide an addition to state hunting
    and also become a part of the conservation department's wildlife trading projects to
    restore other wildlife to our state. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    Missouri's giants are mostly stay-at-home. Some do molting flights, even as far as Canada,
    but return to Missouri. They also may mingle with migrating birds, but apparently remain
    loyal when migrating Canadas move on south to winter feeding grounds along the Gulf Coast,
    or when migrating geese rest and feed in Missouri before winging north in the spring to
    nesting grounds in Canada. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    Meanwhile, &quot;our&quot; Friendly Giants stick to Missouri territory, providing close-up
    glimpses of wildlife -- from cute bundles of gosling fluff to haughty white-cheeked
    adults. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    When the viewing fun fades and the birds become nuisances, the conservation department has
    some suggestions to discourage unwanted Canadas. Here's some tips for next March, the best
    time as the birds are starting nesting duties. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    Giants are tough to discourage. They just don't pay attention to human demands and they
    are legally protected by both federal and state wildlife regulations. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    &quot;Killing them is illegal except during specified hunting seasons and by prescribed
    methods,&quot; reports Jim Low, publicist for the Missouri Department of Conservation. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    &quot;Likewise, it's illegal to disturb them once they begin nesting. Taking their eggs or
    treating them to prevent hatching isn't allowed under federal law, either, unless you get
    a special permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.&quot; <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    There are things you can do to discourage Giant Canada geese from frequenting your
    property or at least prevent them from becoming more numerous, short of killing them or
    disturbing their nests.&quot; Low said. If geese have outstayed their welcome, he offers
    these suggestions: <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    -- Never feed geese</p>
    <p>-- Leave a barrier of grass at least six inches tall around edges of lakes and ponds</p>
    <p>-- Plant hedges or install fences (as short as three feet will do) between the lake
    shore and your yard</p>
    <p>-- Remove manmade nesting structures (such as elevated metal tub nests)</p>
    <p>-- Check property frequently for signs of nest building and remove nest material before
    egg laying begins</p>
    <p>-- Hang reflective plastic streamers (twisted sections of old VCR tapes will work) to
    discourage geese from landing on your property</p>
    <p>-- Use propane cannons or special pyrotechnics (where legal) to frighten geese away</p>
    <p>-- Harass geese whenever they land on your property<br wp="br1">
    </p>
    <p>Noise makers, dogs, brooms and rakes can be used to harass geese, but harassment must
    stop once geese start laying eggs. The only method of capturing, injuring, or killing
    geese is by legal means during the hunting season or with a special permit. A permit also
    is required to destroy or collect wild geese eggs, Low added. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
