<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" color="#FF9900">you guys are just fucking
ass holes.&nbsp; you act like you're fucking gods, and that you can fucking h4x
any fucking site you see.&nbsp; you didn't crack this site, anyway, fuck
head.&nbsp; it's as open as a $.02 whore.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" color="#FF9900">frontpage extensions on, no
password.&nbsp; god damn, it's like you assholes just walked into some elderly
person's house and started trashing it.&nbsp; and then putting a fucking sign on
the front lawn saying that you just cracked them and how you're so fucking 31337
and shit.&nbsp; fuck you.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" color="#FF9900">i don't usually talk to
defacers like this, but i'm in a really fucking bad mood.&nbsp; the person i
like [yea, it's middle skool] hates and ignores me, my dad is a fucking idiot,
my friends are annoying and i have a huge project to do over easter.&nbsp; i
wish my sisters were here ='/</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" color="#FF9900">anyway, hackers are ass
holes.&nbsp; thinking again, 50% of everybody i know is an asshole, and 60% of
the people that are not assholes are ignorant.&nbsp; there are seven people i
know that are not asses/stupid/annoying...two that live out of state, one that
i've been friends for a while, two family members [one of the out of state
ones], and then three girls at skool who don't ignore me and talk to me.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" color="#FF9900">anyway: some people i know
write in their journals or AIM profiles about how their day went.&nbsp; i've
written mine here, using attrition.org as a refrence and rehacking some of those
pages.&nbsp; get over it, who gives a damn about rehacking.&nbsp; you've had
your fucking glory and bull shit, get over it.&nbsp; and yes, i am a 7th grader
with problems.&nbsp; a fucking middle skooler if you like to think of it like
that.&nbsp; but oh well, you're probably just eather some ho who is l33t and
knows lots of shit about the 'underground' or some idiot who came here and
didn't know it was defaced until now.&nbsp; now you probably think i'm some
columbine kid and that i'm going to go kill people and shit.&nbsp; i feel bad
for the victim's families.&nbsp; those kids were stupid.&nbsp; they were.&nbsp;
they're trying to solve their problems by killing other kiddies who are having a
nice, happy, childhood.&nbsp; that's just lame.&nbsp; and manson wasn't the
fucking cause of the shootings eather.&nbsp; let's just put this shit behind us.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" color="#FF9900">manson is shit, just to
clear that up.&nbsp; he makes fun of god and stuff, and i take offense to that.</font></p>

defaced your page originally.&nbsp; look at <a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/2000/04/21/www.kingston-college.ac.uk/">http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/2000/04/21/www.kingston-college.ac.uk/</a>

thingie.&nbsp; it'll solve your problems.&nbsp; do it again before other stupid
ppl come and start claiming they 'cr4x0r3d' [lol, thanks n30] your fine site.</font></p>
