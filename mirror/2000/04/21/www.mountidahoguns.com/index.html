<P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Hey guys. It's me again, and
i would just like to say a few things. </FONT></I></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">One, Artech what is up with
punking off di0aD? You know he has more skill then you, and just
cause you hacked your own webpage (busted.org) it doesn't make
you any better. Your accusing him of using AOL and hacking with
frontpage when in fact your the one doing that. Hey its not me
who notices, any hacker who knows the &quot;scene&quot; will tell
you that you use aol. Of course, im lame right? and so is my group?
Even though i doubt in a strong sense that you could pull off
a non-frontpage hack, let alone a solaris box.</FONT></I></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Two, We have decided to maybe
lay off the NT hacks for now, cause it's just too fucking easy.
As originally posted by me, I want to show the world that there
are good hackers out there. And considering that mostly lamers
(not all, but most) only hack with NT, im gonna try to lay off
it. One or two aint bad.</FONT></I></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Third of all, I wanna tell
you why you might not have seen my hacks on attrition lately.
Well im busy with school for one, and also it takes a few days
to scope out a server, and finally hack and deface it. Expect
quality not quantity. Well at least i'll try.</FONT></I></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Fourthly, I wanna formely
welcome a new member. They go by the name dutp0k, and i consider
them good friends as well as very good hackers. Hell, they helped
me in this hack for fuck sakes. Welcome g0t-milk and hell, to
ph33r the b33r. Please enjoy your stay. :)</FONT></I></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">#5, Mafiaboy, you make me
crack up. I thought you wouldn't get arrested cause you &quot;covered
your tracks&quot;. Haha you got caught by a bunch of fucking frenchies.
You bragged and DDoS'd vetesgirls server, and now your booked.
Good, you stupid punk ass, you deserve it.</FONT></I></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">And lastly, I wanna thank
everyone who has gave me and my group support. Even if its just
a &quot;ptb rocks&quot; on a wwwboard or a &quot;hey p4ntera,
i like your hacks&quot;. Its really flattering to know that people
actually go on attrition just to see what i have hacked next (yeah
i know, it happens :P)</FONT></I></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Oh and one other thing. Team
Infinity, you dumbass bitches. Why do you keep on insiting on
hacking with RDS!!!???? Your gonna turn out like, ugh dare i say
it, cyb3r f4gg37s. God, that would be horrible.</FONT></I></CENTER></P>

<H5><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#00ff00">Shoutz: acidk|own, all of my
metalheads in ph33r the b33r, The Prophecy of course, gH, #feed-the-goats,PHC,
