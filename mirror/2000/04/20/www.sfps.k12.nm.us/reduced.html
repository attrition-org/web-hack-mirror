<P>Application forms are being sent to all homes with a letter to parents

or guardians. To apply for free and reduced price meals, households should

fill out the application and return it to the school. The information provided

on the application will be used for the purpose of determining eligibility

and may be verified at any time during the school year by school or other

program officials. Free and reduced price eligibility may be subject to

release to other federal, state, and local education health, or other means

tested programs. This release is limited to the Title I and National Assessment

of Educational progress (NAEP) programs.



<P>For school officials to determine eligibility, households which currently

include children who receive food stamps and/or benefits under the Food

Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) must complete an application

listing the child's name, Food Stamp and/or FDPIR case number, and the

signature of an adult household member or provide a direct certification

letter from the Department of Human Services. Children in the household

with the same case number and in the same school may be included on the

same application. Separate applications are required for children in the

same household with different case numbers. If the family does not list

a Food Stamp and/or FDPIR case number for all the children they are applying

for, the application must contain all the information as required for "other

households" as described below. Households receiving food stamps and/or

FDPIR must list the child's name, food stamp and/or FDPIR case number and

the signature and name of an adult household member. Households not receiving

food stamps and/or FDPIR must list the names of all household members,

social security number of the adult signing the application or the word,

'none' if the adult member does not possess one, total household income

plus the amount and source of income received by each household member

and the signature of an adult household member certifying that the information

provided is correct.



<P>Applications&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; at&nbsp; any&nbsp;

time&nbsp; during&nbsp; the&nbsp; year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the&nbsp;

provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; free&nbsp; and&nbsp; reduced&nbsp;

price&nbsp; policy, Christina Anaya:&nbsp; S N A P Coordinator will review

applications and determine eligibility. Parents or guardians dissatisfied

with the ruling of the official may wish to discuss the decision with the

approving official on an informal basis. Parents wishing to make a formal

appeal may make a request, either orally or in writing, to&nbsp; Judi Jaquez,

R.D., L.D. Executive Director&nbsp; for a hearing on the decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

2600 Cerillos Road,&nbsp;&nbsp; 989-5434

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>Households that list a Food Stamp and/or FDPIR case number must report

when the household no longer receives these benefits. Other households

approved for benefits are required to report increases in household income

of over fifty dollars ($50) per month or six-hundred dollars ($600) per

year and decreases in household size. Also, if a household member becomes

unemployed or if the household size increases the household should contact

the school. Such changes may make the children of the household eligible

for reduced price meals or for free meals if the households income falls

at or below the levels shown in the household size and income criteria

chart above.



<P>In certain cases, foster children are, also, eligible for school meal

benefits. If a household wishes to apply for benefits for foster children

living with them, the household should contact the school for more information.

The information provided by the household is confidential and will be used

only for the purposes of determining eligibility and verifying data.



<P>In the operation of child feeding programs administered by the United

States Department of Agriculture (USDA), no child will be discriminated

because of age, sex, color, national origin, race, or disability. If any

member of a household believes he or she has been discriminated against

one may immediately write to tile Secretary of Agriculture, Washington,

D.C. 20250.
