</B></I></FONT><P>During the 1990s an increasing number of the citizens of Santa Fe, New Mexico concluded that the Santa Fe Public School (SFPS) District was unable to provide information about its cost and management processes in a manner that was prompt, consistent, reliable and understandable. The New Mexico State Department of Education declared that the school district had not demonstrated the ability to properly manage their financial responsibilities and, therefore, assumed an oversight authority over the school district's financial affairs. Citizen observations indicate that the budget development process is weak and that budget controls do not appear to include a position control process. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was retained to conduct a management and organizational analysis of the school district, targeting the following components: organizational, management, and governance practices; financial development and operational practices; use of technology; personnel (HR) practices; and community involvement practices. The primary purpose of the Management and Operational Analysis was to assess the current operational practices in <I>targeted</I> areas and to recommend corrective action that, if implemented, would improve operational effectiveness and efficiency in the District.</P>

</B></I></FONT><P>The scope of this assessment included a high-level analysis of the district's &quot;as-is&quot; processes (that is, those currently in use) in the five targeted areas. On the basis of the as-is process analysis, recommendations for making substantial improvements were developed and are presented in this document. This effort defines process-reengineering recommendations, and includes sample tools, templates, and report formats, along with recommendations for structural and organizational changes. Additionally, PwC provided data sources and best practices/strategies to be used in setting priorities. As appropriate, each recommendation contains a suggested &quot;Implementation Strategy/Timeline&quot;. The purpose of these sections are to provide a step by step action plan which outlines both a logical sequence for implementation as well as a general time frame when each step could be reasonably expected to be achieved.

</B></I></FONT><P>In order to identify changes that would improve and simplify delivery of the SFPS's administrative services, PwC first had to understand the current environment.</P>

<P>Once the District’s priorities were understood, PwC sought to learn the structure and processes already in place in the District. PwC focused on how to best improve the delivery of services from the central office. At the same time, PwC was mindful that this report also focuses on the needs of the customers of the services. As such, our information-gathering efforts went beyond identifying only the needs of the SFPS staff. PwC also received input from customers and stakeholders (teachers, school administrators, members of the Santa Fe community, Board of Education members, members of the New Mexico State Department of Education, etc.) to fully understand the needs for the need for change.</P>

<P>PwC used a variety of techniques to understand and develop recommendations for improving and simplifying the processes. In addition to the interviews mentioned above, we reviewed existing documents. We also conducted a high-level analysis of the core processes used by various central administrative departments. In doing the assessment, we used some limited and high-level benchmarking data to discover how other organizations approached similar process and organizational issues.</P>

<P>After gaining some understanding of the strategic level of SFPS’s management environment, we conducted a series of interviews with members of the SFPS organizations directly involved in management. PwC conducted the various types of interviews with distinctly different objectives. The first was conducted with senior leaders of the SFPS staff. PwC sought their views to determine what types of services and organization they believed would best meet the strategic needs of the district. </P>

<P>In broad terms we asked the leadership to:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Define success as it applies to this project</LI>
<LI>Identify changes for improving the quality of services</LI>
<LI>Identify which processes are currently working well and should be retained</LI>
<LI>Identify key customers and stakeholders and what is important to them</LI>
<LI>Identify important processes.</LI></UL>


<P>After obtaining the strategic vision from senior leaders, we conducted additional interviews with managers of various departments and school administrators. Here we shifted from the strategic level to a focus on the operational level or specific activities for which the administration is responsible. We asked their help in identifying those activities most important in providing services and the roles and responsibilities of the personnel involved in the processes. In conducting these sessions we asked participants to identify some of the same items described above, especially which processes are working well and should be retained. Beyond that, we asked them to describe opportunities for improvement. With this information we began the task of identifying the key areas of the processes on which the SFPS should concentrate its reengineering efforts in order to have the most immediate impact on the delivery of services.<A NAME="_Toc461877876"><A NAME="_Toc461878497"><A NAME="_Toc461878794"><A NAME="_Toc462548920"><A NAME="_Toc462559674"><A NAME="_Toc462562776"><A NAME="_Toc462565906"><A NAME="_Toc462566315"><A NAME="_Toc462651782"><A NAME="_Toc462652438"><A NAME="_Toc462819140"><A NAME="_Toc462983625"><A NAME="_Toc462998346"><A NAME="_Toc463064695"><A NAME="_Toc463420517"><A NAME="_Toc463691294"><A NAME="_Toc463768870"><A NAME="_Toc466791992"><A NAME="_Toc466793451"><A NAME="_Toc471792129"><A NAME="_Toc471793897"><A NAME="_Toc471806541"><A NAME="_Toc472321506"><A NAME="_Toc472484823"><A NAME="_Toc473346933"><A NAME="_Toc473352867"><A NAME="_Toc473353092"><A NAME="_Toc473353212"><A NAME="_Toc473359321"><A NAME="_Toc473359668"><A NAME="_Toc473362755"><A NAME="_Toc473366009"><A NAME="_Toc473541883"><A NAME="_Toc473542201"><A NAME="_Toc473544922"><A NAME="_Toc473550210"><A NAME="_Toc473621666"><A NAME="_Toc473623369"><A NAME="_Toc473687919"><A NAME="_Toc473694962"><A NAME="_Toc473695203"><A NAME="_Toc473697305"></P>

</B></I></FONT><P>A Management and Operational Analysis was conducted of the Santa Fe Public Schools to review the current operational practices in five <I>target</I> areas. These five areas consisted of:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Organization, Management, and Governance Practices</LI>
<LI>Financial Development and Operational Practices</LI>
<LI>Use of Technology</LI>
<LI>Personnel (Human Resources) Practices</LI>
<LI>Community Involvement Practices</LI></UL>


<P>These targeted areas were selected for analysis to examine the core management and operational functions of the District. The analysis was to focus on those functions that have a direct impact on the effective and efficient performance of the District’s primary mission (i.e. the education of Santa Fe pupils). These basic functions included:</P>


<UL>
<LI>District policy and administrative practices.</LI>
<LI>Management and control of the District’s financial resources.</LI>
<LI>Management of the District’s personnel resources.</LI>
<LI>Management of the District’s management information by technology.</LI>
<LI>Communication with the public and use of community resources.</LI></UL>


<P>These <U>basic</U> functions determine, to a great extent, how, what and how effectively education of Santa Fe pupils is conducted</P>

<P>Students tend not to perform to their best when:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Appropriate teachers are not always available.</LI>
<LI>Classroom supplies are inadequate.</LI>
<LI>Best textbooks and learning materials are not always available.</LI>
<LI>Classrooms are not properly equipped and maintained.</LI>
<LI>Etc.</LI></UL>


<P>It was therefore concluded that the initial analysis of the District should focus upon these basic and core functions of the District.</P>

<P>This analysis was not an &quot;audit&quot; of the District’s finances. We were not asked, nor did we attempt to determine, how or why there was an alleged $2.6 million dollar short fall, or why reports that Special Education funds are not always reflected in classroom teacher/pupil ratios. This was a &quot;targeted&quot; analysis that only focused on the &quot;processes&quot; and &quot;practices&quot; that the District follows to manage and operate a $100,000,000 enterprise.</P>

<P>The PricewaterhouseCoopers analysis team received excellent cooperation and assistance from the Board of Education and the administrative staff of the Santa Fe Public Schools. Each and every request for materials, documents, and interviews was promptly and pleasantly provided. Over 60 individuals were interviewed, 125 documents were requested and reviewed, and three focus groups were conducted. This wide range of community and staff input could have only been achieved with the full cooperation of the Board of Education and the administrative personnel of the Santa Fe Public Schools. We are pleased to report that the basic management and operational problems plaguing the District, are not in most instances, caused by dishonest or malicious employees. We found that the problems of the District are basically weak and inadequate management and operational practices. Our recommendations identify what and how corrective action can be taken to correct these management weaknesses. </P>

<P>Input received from the scores of staff and citizen participants provided the PwC analysis team with invaluable information and insights. Everywhere we turned, in addition to answers to our questions, we received more questions from citizens and staff who wanted us to study additional issues. In many cases, these issues related to functions and practices beyond the targeted areas that we were engaged to examine. We apologize to the many individuals who expressed these concerns and hope that their comments will be thoughtfully and thoroughly pursued in the not too distant future.</P>

<P>Our many experiences with the citizens of Santa Fe indicated time and time again that they had a strong interest in creating the <U>very best </U>school system. Their &quot;interest&quot;, was always equaled by an expression of commitment and willingness to actively participate for the benefit of <U>all</U> pupils.</P>

<P>A comprehensive final report was prepared that provides extensive information about each of the five targeted areas. Information is provided in the final report on a variety of details such as:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Current practices</LI>
<LI>Findings</LI>
<LI>Recommendations</LI>

</B></FONT><P>The structural design of any organization (i.e., Table of Organization [T.O.]) should be grounded in a clear concept of its intended mission and objectives. Knowing what is to be done, naturally, must precede knowing how to do it. In a complex operation like a school district that serves over 13,000 pupils in 28 school sites and is supported with an annual budget of approximately $100,000,000, it is expected that each operational task required to achieve the &quot;intended mission and objectives&quot; be identified in measurable and time-sensitive terms. These specialized tasks must in turn be clustered into compatible organizational units; provided with effective channels of communications between one another; and integrated into harmonious teams by common objectives and policies, each unit having access to unequivocal directives, control and information systems, and receiving central guidance and appropriate authority.</P>

</B></FONT><P>Exhibit A reflects the organizational structure that was in place in the district in September 1999 when the PricewaterhouseCoopers Management and Operational Analysis was initiated. The current Superintendent essentially &quot;inherited&quot; this organizational structure.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">EXHIBIT A</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">DISTRICT ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE – SEPTEMBER 1999</P>
</B><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Image2.gif" WIDTH=546 HEIGHT=412></P>

<P>A perception by some school district stakeholders expressed to the PricewaterhouseCoopers Analysis team was that &quot;…the District is top-heavy…with administrators.&quot; Given this perception, the PwC team examined the administrative staffing patterns with great care within those <U>targeted focus areas </U>of the Management and Operations Analysis. It is important to remember that this Analysis focused on only five major operational areas. These primarily involved the following SFPS organizational units:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Board of Education</LI>
<LI>Office of the Superintendent</LI>
<LI>Office of Legal Counsel</LI>
<LI>Office of Financial Services</LI>
<LI>Office of Human Resources</LI>
<LI>Office of Technology</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>Office of Public Information</LI>
<LI>Various community involvement practices</LI></UL>


<P>While the above organizational units represent a major portion of the District’s leadership services and activities, they collectively only represent approximately 2.3% of all District costs. School districts serving 20,000 pupils or less, typically expend an average of 2.17% on non-school based leadership (see Appendix 11.5).</P>

<P>Our staffing analysis found no excessive administrative or support service personnel assigned to these organizational units. In each case, these central administrative offices were staffed at or below staffing levels found in similar school districts across the Nation. Specifically, staffing patterns were compared with the following school districts:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Pasadena Unified School District, CA</LI>
<LI>Scottsdale Unified School District, AZ</LI>
<LI>Dysart Unified School District, AZ</LI>
<LI>Passaic Public Schools, NJ</LI></UL>


<P>It is also important to understand that in a typical school district (serving 20,000 or less pupils), well over 60% of all expenses are dedicated to two major operational areas (i.e. Instruction and Instructional Support) (see Appendix 11.5). As referenced in section 6.3.4 of this report, &quot;PwC has requested SFPS staff to provide information so that expenditure benchmark data can be developed for SFPS. PwC is currently developing this information which will be added as an addendum to this report.&quot;</P>

<P>It is not uncommon to find &quot;top heavy administration&quot; within these two operational areas. As stated above, however, this analysis did not focus on these two areas and therefore, we are unable to express an opinion regarding the appropriateness of administrative staffing patterns beyond that stated above.</P>

<P>The organizational structure of the District’s central office reflects a series of ad hoc adjustments driven more by individual personalities and perceived expertise than by a clear vision and management delivery strategy. For example, elementary school principals report to the Associate Superintendent for School Effectiveness and secondary principals report to Assistant Superintendent of Learning Support and Human Resources. It is the general belief among district employees that this organizational bifurcation was implemented primarily to eliminate any appearance of nepotism or conflict of interest.</P>

<P>Board Policy PB8180 states that:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&quot;No employee shall directly supervise, influence, or control the employment of his or her spouse, father, father-in-law, mother, mother-in-law, son, son-in-law, daughter, or daughter-in-law.</P>

<P>&#9;&quot;The placement of any persons in positions where their employment may be indirectly supervised, influenced, or controlled by near relatives (those mentioned in this policy) shall be discouraged and be made only in circumstances where qualifications are unquestionable and they meet all requirements of the position.</P>

<P>&#9;&quot;In all such cases, the school board shall adopt and make part of the employment agreement with said employee a plan to insulate the employee from the direct or indirect supervision, influence, or control of his or her relative.&quot;</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Input from a wide variety of District employees and stakeholders indicates that they believe that the elimination of the &quot; . . . appearance of nepotism or conflict of interest&quot; has not been achieved through the bifurcation of reporting relationships between and among elementary and secondary principals.</P>

<P>Board policy 8180 clearly states that &quot; . . . in circumstances where qualifications are unquestionable and they meet all requirements . . .&quot; it is permissible to place a person under the &quot;control&quot; of a near relative and that &quot;. . . the school board shall adopt and make part of the employment agreement with said employee a plan to insulate . . .&quot;</P>

<P>The significance of this situation is that the District’s table of organization was reconfigured at a very high level to the detriment of operational efficiency (i.e., clear lines of authority and, more importantly, credibility among rank and file staff members).</P>

<P>Other organizational conditions include several one-person organizational offices that deal with similar responsibilities, e.g., testing and assessment, research, design and accountability.</P>

<P>The number of top-level administrative positions suggests &quot;title inflation&quot; and &quot;position creep.&quot; The Superintendent is aware of this situation and is considering adjustments to reduce the numbers of positions entitled:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Superintendent</LI>
<LI>Executive Director</LI>
<LI>Director</LI></UL>


<P>Corresponding adjustments would increase the number of administrative positions entitled:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Coordinator</LI>
<LI>Division Head</LI>
<LI>Supervisor</LI></UL>


<P>The organizational structure of school sites generally reflects a traditional configuration (i.e., principals, support staff, and teaching personnel). Several schools have modest variations, such as a position of &quot;business manager/grant writer,&quot; block program scheduling configuration, and school-within-a-school concepts (based on Ted Sizer’s Essential Schools concept.</P>

</B></I><P>The governance of the District is the responsibility of an elected five-member Board of Education that derives its authority from the educational statutes of the State of New Mexico (22-5-4 Local School Boards - Powers – Duties). The Board delegates administrative and supervisory responsibilities to the Superintendent to carry out the policy decisions of the Board. In this capacity the Superintendent is expected to advise the Board on three essentially interrelated resources: money, personnel, and time. The Superintendent carries out these responsibilities through the reporting and recommendation process to and with the board (i.e., board meetings).</P>

<P>Under the current process, the Board typically reviews, discusses and decides a multitude of diverse, complicated and significant issues during a six-day period. On the Thursday preceding a Board meeting, a packet of board reports (recommendations) is made available to Board members if they choose to attend a pre-scheduled Board Review Session. Unfortunately, Board members seldom attend these sessions. On the Friday, a complete Board Report packet is delivered to each Board member so that they can review the material prior to the Board meeting on the following Tuesday. Discussion on any agenda item can occur during the Tuesday Board meeting. This discussion occurs prior to voting &quot;yeah&quot; or &quot;nay. Several Board members indicated that when asking staff questions regarding specific Board reports, there is &quot; . . . seldom a correlation between what was asked and what staff responded.&quot;</P>

<P>Board reports do not contain the consistent and standard informational elements that Board members feel they need to make informed and thoughtful decisions. Some of the information not consistently found in Board Reports includes:</P>

</B></I><P>There are generally three common explanations for the failures of a public school district. These are:</P>

<OL>

<OL>

<U><LI>District managers and administrators do not perform in a businesslike manner</U>. Generally, in a school district, &quot;businesslike&quot; means the control of costs. While this is essential, it is only one foundational aspect.</LI></OL>
</OL>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>2.&#9;<U>The district needs better-qualified personnel</U>. The tasks of a school must be organized so that typical employees can manage and fill the executive positions of a school district. It is unreasonable to expect that average, fairly educated men and women cannot effectively perform administrative responsibilities. Tasks must be organized so that they can be performed by people who are held accountable for their effective and efficient achievement.</P>

<P>3.&#9;<U>District’s objectives and results are intangible</U>. The definition of what is the &quot;business of a school district&quot; is sometimes viewed as intangible. Yet, it is not impossible to define concrete and measurable goals, objectives, and tasks. Educating children as the objective of a school district is intangible. But school attendance is measurable. The development of the whole personality of a child is, indeed, intangible. But teaching a child to read by the time he/she has finished the third grade is by no mean intangible and is measured easily and with considerable precision.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Achievement must be measured against specific, limited, clearly defined targets.  When targets are defined, resources can be effectively allocated for their attainment; priorities and deadlines can be set; and personnel can be held accountable for results. The starting point for effective work is a definition of the purpose and mission of any institution.</P>

<P>The District has not established a strategic direction with accompanying functional management/action plans. There is evidence that efforts have been initiated to develop action plans for 1999-00, specifically, this effort was initiated in November of the current school year. The District’s informational content requires that action steps be delineated to achieve a specific Board of Education goal. The present action plan format, however, does not yield quantifiable standards upon which one can assess or evaluate performance. Thus, the value of these action plans to assess and improve performance is questionable.</P>

</B></I><P>Utilization of a professional public information services firm familiar with the Santa Fe community is strongly recommended.</P>

<P>SFPS needs the ability to communicate with the various stakeholder groups that comprise the greater Santa Fe community in an open, objective, informative, reliable, and responsive manner.</P>

<P>Board Policy 1100 states that &quot;It will be the policy of the Board to maintain a continuing information program for compiling and distributing news of events, noteworthy facts, statistics, plans, and forecasts necessary to the creation of an interested and informed public.&quot;</P>

<P>No administrative guidelines have been promulgated to implement this Board policy, which was adopted on May 5, 1981. No strategic or management plan has been developed by the Public Information Office.</P>

<P>Strategic and management planning allows an organization to identify the steps necessary to achieve its mission and vision. Developing a plan that strategically positions an organization to achieve its mission and vision requires a coordinated effort at all levels of planning, implementation, and monitoring of performance.</P>

<P>A management plan drives all work activities conducted throughout an organization. In well-managed organizations, individual management plans are required of all operating units to ensure that their performance constructively contributes to the organization’s strategic mission and vision.</P>

<P>The current operational mode of the Public Information Office appears to lack a sense of independence and freedom. The free flow of valuable District information does not appear to be an operational prerogative.</P>

<P>Input received from community representatives and parent focus groups expressed strong dissatisfaction with the quality and reliability of public information activities of the district.</P>

<P>The public expects that the Office of Public Information will release information that is timely, accurate, objective, and balanced. Concerns expressed by district stakeholders were that the &quot;Office&quot; too frequently functioned as a <I>public relations</I> service for the central administration and not as it should, as a <I>public information</I> service to the community.</P>

<P>The distinction between the role of a public information office versus a public relations office is important for a publicly supported school district to understand and act upon.</P>

<P>Private companies and corporations generally use public relations strategies to create a specific &quot;spin&quot; among specific elements of the public in order to influence their points of view and actions regarding specific issues, products, and/or services pertinent to the private organization.</P>

<P>Public entities, on the other hand, tend to restrict their communication activities to providing timely, objective, and relevant information that has no specific &quot;spin.&quot;</P>

<P>While &quot;spin&quot; is found to some extent in any communications effort, its effect and use are generally secondary to a forthright public information effort.</P>

<P>A sound public information program must be a two-way street if the organization’s objective is to develop reciprocal understanding.</P>

<P>This means that in today’s society, the school district must be fully responsive to the environment in which it functions if it is to manage and serve in meaningful and effective terms.</P>

<P>An attuned public information office that facilitates a two-way communication with the organization’s public can serve to advise management of trends and conditions that could have significance for <I>and</I> to the school district.</P>

<P>SFPS could outsource its Public Information Office services to a privately operated communications firm.</P>

<P>The Santa Fe community has substantial resources that have the professional capabilities and expertise to provide open, objective, informative, reliable, and responsive information.</P>

<P>The fact that the public information services would be provided by an independent professional service firm would add considerable credibility to any information the district released.</P>

<P>Extensive research indicates that the two most effective public information sources of any school district are the students and teaching personnel.</P>

<P>Students visibly represent their schools every day. The public tends to look upon the District’s students as personifying the characteristics of the school and school itself. The SFPS has over 13,000 students to represent the schools and school district. A well-managed school district would utilize this invaluable resource to provide positive and constructive public information. Whenever parents and friends witness a demonstration, read a student publication, or watch a skilled performance by pupils, they generally express appreciation for the fine work and guidance that the students receive from their teachers and school. These opportunities exist everyday when the child goes home to his/her parents/guardians and tells them what they did in school that day. Teachers should be encouraged to make sure that each day each pupil is reminded of what they accomplished that day. Teachers can use part of each days lesson to solicit input from their students (both elementary and secondary) how they parents/guardians respond to the pupils accomplishments. Additionally, opportunities connected with such routine events as commencement, plays, musicals, athletic contests, and service projects, can all contribute substantially to a constructive public perception of what the schools and teachers are doing.</P>

<P>Teachers are still considered by the public as the most reliable and relevant source of information about the day-to-day activities and achievements of schools and the school district. Again, a well-managed school district could use utilize this resource to provide positive and constructive public information.</P>

<P>Beyond these two pervasive public information forces, the central Public Information office should, at a minimum:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Establish a two-way communication system between the school system and the community, and between the school system and state and national groups</LI>
<LI>Interpret policy of the Board of Education and the programs of the school system to the public</LI>
<LI>Plan, develop, and produce internal and external publications</LI>
<LI>Prepare feature material for newspaper, radio, and television</LI>
<LI>Assume the role of liaison with all news media</LI>
<LI>Assist school personnel and Board personnel in planning public participation events</LI>
<LI>Provide school-community relations consulting services to Board of Education members, central office administrators, and school principals</LI>
<LI>Help assess public attitudes and keep appropriate school personnel informed</LI>
<LI>Serve as a source of information to individuals from the community regarding school matters and from the community to the school district</LI>
<LI>Serve as a consultant in the preparation of informational materials prepared by school personnel</LI>
<LI>Assimilate and disseminate informative materials</LI>
<LI>Evaluate informative materials produced by the school system in terms of their internal and external communicative value</LI>
<LI>Provide effective leadership in implementing the school district’s commitment to full compliance with civil rights legislation, rules, and regulations.</LI></UL>


<P>These P.I. areas can be used to develop performance expectations in quantifiable and time-sensitive terms appropriate for inclusion in a contractual agreement to outsource these services.</P>

</B></I><P>Two years ago, a &quot;4x4&quot; block schedule was instituted at both high schools. The intent of instituting a 4x4 block schedule to replace the traditional six-period-day class schedule was to increase the number of instructional minutes by converting &quot;passing time&quot; to instructional time. This would be accomplished by establishing four 90-minute instructional classes to replace the six periods generally found in a traditional high school class schedule.</P>

<P>Substantial research indicates that by increasing &quot;time-on-task,&quot; students can achieve greater learning gains over time.</P>

<P>Increased &quot;time alone&quot; will not necessarily result in greater learning gains unless preceded with staff training in the delivery of sound instruction over a 90-minute period compared to the typical 50-55-minute lessons that are required in a traditional class schedule.</P>

<P>The following analysis is intended to provide an example of the impact upon the District (both fiscally and programmatically) when initiatives and/or programs are implemented without adequate administrative planning and preparation.</P>

<P>Other types of preparation that must occur beyond pedagogy (i.e., training) include:</P>


<UL>
<LI>curriculum (course content/sequence) redesign</LI>
<LI>course credit</LI>
<LI>community understanding</LI>
<LI>collective bargaining (see Article 6D of NEA agreement).</LI></UL>


<P>Input from teachers, school administrators, parents, and community representatives consistently expressed that:</P>


<UL>
<LI>no teacher training was provided</LI>
<LI>curriculum was not redesigned</LI>
<LI>the issue of course credit was not addressed</LI>
<LI>the community had and has little understanding of the 4x4-block schedule.</LI></UL>


<P>The following analysis is provided to highlight in quantifiable terms both the differences <I>and</I> the impact of the 4x4 block versus the traditional master class schedule.</P>

<I><P>Difference:</I> 1) Teachers in a 4x4-block schedule <I>reduce</I> instructional hours by 56, which represent a reduction of 11% in direct student contact time. 2) Teachers in a 4x4-block schedule <I>increase</I> preparatory hours by 56, which represent an increase of 33% in student-free time.</P>

<P>The combined impact of reducing direct instructional time and increasing non-instructional preparatory time creates a demand for additional teaching positions to be assigned to each high school to maintain appropriate student-teacher ratios in the classrooms.</P>

<P>At a minimum, this combined reduction in direct instructional time with a corresponding increase in teacher preparatory time generates a need for 9.33 teacher FTEs (i.e., 56 hours/day <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#184;</FONT>
 6 periods). The average teacher’s salary in Santa Fe, as reported to the State Department of Education Training and Experience Report, is $31,013. Therefore, 9.33 FTEs would cost the District a minimum of $289,351 per year per high school.</P>

<P>Given the inadequacy of preparation to implement the 4x4 block master schedule in the critical areas of:</P>


<UL>
<LI>teacher training,</LI>
<LI>curriculum design,</LI>
<LI>course credit,</LI>
<LI>community understanding, and</LI>
<LI>collective bargaining,</LI></UL>


<P>plus the added associated expenses, it is recommended that the District re-institute a traditional master program schedule at the two regular high schools.</P>

<P>The Board of Education adopted a &quot;philosophy&quot; statement on November 3, 1981 that states:</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Philosophy of the Santa Fe Public Schools</P>
</I><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;Education is a vital and continuous part of the life process and as such the instructional programs offered by the Santa Fe Public Schools are designed to implement programs which will lead toward achievement of the following educational goals:</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The statement is contained in the District’s policy manual as Board Policy 6000. Also included in Board Policy 6000 are the following organizational goals:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Programs and related experiences which will result in economically competent citizens.</LI>

<LI>Skill in problem-solving through observing, listening, speaking, writing, investigating, analyzing, and evaluating.</LI>

<LI>An understanding of the responsibilities of good citizenship joined with loyalty and respect for the ideals of our democratic society.</LI>

<LI>Competence to understand and function effectively in a rapidly changing world.</LI>

<LI>Understanding and appreciation of persons belonging to all social, cultural, and ethnic groups.</LI>

<LI>A positive self-image through the development of self-respect, self-discipline, self-analysis, and self-improvement.</LI>

<LI>Good health habits and an understanding of environmental conditions necessary for the maintenance of mental, physical, and emotional well-being.</LI>

<LI>An awareness of the need for conservation of human and natural resources.</LI>

<LI>A positive attitude toward the learning process and the realization that education is a lifetime activity.</LI>

<LI>Constructive use of leisure time to broaden one’s interests and to develop creative talents.</LI>

<LI>Appreciation of the family as a basic unit of society through which our cultural heritage may be transmitted and moral standards may be established.</LI></OL>


<P>It is important to note that no administrative regulation was promulgated to implement this important policy.</P>

<P>In 1998-99 a new set of &quot;Board of Education Goals&quot; was included in the SFPS Board Policies Manual. Again, no implementing administrative regulations were found regarding the following goals:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Develop a culture of self-respect and respect for each other utilizing the diversity of the Santa Fe Public Schools community.</LI>

<LI>Ensure that each student demonstrates mastery of academic and technological literacy and exhibits effective social skills.</LI>

<LI>Make Santa Fe Public Schools the center of our community through increased support for youth and families.</LI>

<LI>Provide our students safe, disciplined, and nurturing learning environments.</LI>

<LI>Reduce the student dropout rate.</LI>

<LI>Improve processes and procedures associated with financial and asset management.</LI>

<LI>Broaden the funding base and increase resources for the Santa Fe Public Schools.</LI></OL>


<P>In response to the question, &quot;Do you feel that the Board of Education and top administrators share the same vision for the education process at SFPS,&quot; focus group participants answered as follows:</P>

<P>&#9;<U>Response</U>&#9;&#9;<U>Percentage</P>
</U><P>&#9;Same Vision&#9;&#9; 0%</P>
<P>&#9;Different Vision&#9;48%</P>
<P>&#9;*&quot;What Vision?&quot;&#9;52%</P>
<P>*Note: participants added this category</P>

<P>When focus group participants were asked, &quot;Do you feel that school site administrators share the same vision for the education process at SFPS as the current Superintendent,&quot; a similar response was given.</P>

<P>&#9;<U>Response</U>&#9;&#9;<U>Percentage</P>
</U><P>&#9;Same Vision&#9;&#9;17%</P>
<P>&#9;Different Vision&#9;35%</P>
<P>&#9;*&quot;What Vision?&quot;&#9;48%</P>

<P>Well-managed educational organizations have clear vision, mission and/or philosophical statements that are understood and accepted by a majority of the stakeholder groups.</P>

<P>The responses cited above and prevalent throughout the interviews indicated no common understanding and therefore no common acceptance of what the District was trying to achieve.</P>

<P>The strong consensus among interviewees and focus group participants is that the District has a strong record of announcing new initiatives, directives, and plans, but &quot; . . . never or seldom follows through with any of them . . . &quot;</P>

<P>It is therefore recommended that the District recreate a vision, mission and/or philosophical statement to establish among school district stakeholders a shared and understandable direction. The community should have substantial participation in the articulation of this statement and in the creation of the process used to accomplish it.</P>

</B></I><P>The District has a manual entitled &quot;Santa Fe Public School Board Policies and Administrative Regulations,&quot; revised October 1999.</P>

<P>This publication is designed to serve two purposes:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1.&#9;To codify all adopted Board of Education policies regarding &quot;. . . the successful and efficient functioning of the public schools.&quot;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;</P>
<P>Specifically, Board Policy 1000 states that,</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1.&#9;The Board considers policy development one of its chief functions. It is the intent of the Board to develop policies and put them in writing so that they may serve as guidelines and goals for the successful and efficient functioning of the public schools.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<OL>

<OL>

<LI>It is through the development and adoption of written policies that the Board will exercise its leadership in the operation of the school system: it is through study and evaluation of the reports concerning the execution of its written policies that the Board will exercise its control over school operations.</LI></OL>
</OL>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>3.&#9;It is the Board’s intention that its written policies serve as guides for the discretionary action of those to whom it delegates authority and as a source of information and guidance for all persons who are interested in, and affected by, the district school.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>To carry out the stated intent of the Board, 195 policies have been adopted that address the following areas of district operations:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Community</LI>
<LI>Administration</LI>
<LI>Business</LI>
<LI>Personnel</LI>
<LI>Students</LI>
<LI>Instruction</LI>
<LI>Capital outlay projects</LI>
<LI>Board of Education</LI>
<LI>By-laws of the Board</LI></UL>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>2.&#9;The second purpose of this manual is to codify administrative regulations that have been promulgated to <I>implement</I> the policies adopted by the Board.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Specifically, Administrative Regulation 1000 states that:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1.&#9;The Administration considers the implementation of regulations and administrative procedure development as one of its chief functions. It is the intent of the Administration to develop administrative procedures, so that they may serve as guidelines for the successful and efficient functioning of the public school.</P>

<P>2.&#9;It is through the development and adoption of directives and procedures that the Administration will exercise its leadership in the operation of the school system. Ongoing evaluation and input from staff is critical in the development of such directives and procedures.</P>

<P>3.&#9;It is the Administration’s intention that its written procedures give direction to those to whom it delegates authority and as a source of information and guidance for all persons who are interested in, and affected by, the district schools.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>As stated above, &quot;it is the intent of the Administration to develop administrative procedures, so that they may serve as guidelines for the successful and efficient functioning of the public schools.&quot;</P>

<P>This manual only contains nine administrative regulations. This represents less than a 5% response by Administration to the development of &quot;guidelines.&quot;</P>

<P>School districts that are well managed have extensive administrative regulations that staff can follow to perform the thousands of responsibilities required in today’s complex school systems.</P>

<P>The lack of adequate guidelines results in staff continually rediscovering what, when, and how the work of the District needs to be done.</P>

<P>This lack of management leadership results in excess cost to constantly &quot;reinvent&quot; work processes, procedures, and practices. Inherent in this style of leadership is the high probability of costly errors and inefficiencies in the conduct of District work.</P>

<P>A public-tax-supported organization has an ethical and professional duty to create a management system that can be understood, transferred, and performed by new and different individuals over time. The work of the District should be documented and not solely be held in the minds of a few individuals.</P>

<P>The development and use of an Administrative manual is one of the most essential elements of an administrative team committed to: (Board of Education 1998-99 Goal Number 6) &quot;improve process and procedures associated with financial and asset management.&quot;</P>

</B></I><P>Currently, the District does not have any systematic process to comprehensively monitor and manage the diverse activities that are performed throughout the District at all levels of the organization.</P>

<P>Each of these diverse but interrelated activities consumes resources (i.e., time and money) and achieves various levels of productivity and impact.</P>

<P>An effectively managed organization requires a management capability that provides information about how the District’s resources (i.e., people, materials, and time) are utilized to provide a service or product to the clients (students, staff, and stakeholders) of the District.</P>

<P>During the past few decades, Board members and superintendents have been asking tough management questions such as:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1.&#9;<I>Organizational Structure:</I> Which parts of our organization should be consolidated or decentralized? What work should be done in-house, and what should be outsourced?</P>

<P>2&#9;<I>Right-Sizing:</I> How do you determine the right size of your organization? (The right size of an organization is defined as that size/configuration that gets the &quot;work&quot; done in a manner that meets your expectations of: quality, effectiveness, and efficiency.)</P>

<P>3.&#9;<I>Measuring Performance:</I> How do we measure progress in improvement of programs as well as determine the value of the results they produce?</P>

<P>4.&#9;<I>Managing Costs:</I> How do we define, identify, and eliminate work that adds no value to our services? How do we know our work is cost-effective?</P>

<P>5.&#9;<I>Improving Controls:</I> How do we improve operational and financial controls to reduce risks to the District and its constituents? More specifically, how much money in our budget is not expended or encumbered and how much is available for reallocation at a given time?</P>

<P>6.&#9;<I>Competing:</I> How do we compete against other public and private organizations that want to take over our mission and service, e.g., charter schools and vouchers?</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<I><P>How</I> resources are used in an organization to perform its &quot;work&quot; determines its level of productivity.</P>

<P>During the past few decades, American public schools have been in the throes of reform. Poor student performance on basic skills and general knowledge tests, low levels of achievement for U.S. students compared to their international counterparts, and low rates of adult literacy have caused the general public, as well as professional educators, to call for substantial improvements in the productivity of our educational delivery system.</P>

<P>Several tools have been used by school districts to assess their productivity levels, including:</P>


<UL>
<LI>pupil achievement scores on state and nationally normed reference tests as well as district-level criterion reference tests;</LI>
<LI>surveys of parent, student, and employee satisfaction;</LI>
<LI>high school graduation rates;</LI>
<LI>college placement rates;</LI>
<LI>attendance rates; and</LI>
<LI>dropout rates.</LI></UL>


<P>All are being used to assess the productivity of school districts.</P>

<P>Traditional school district budgeting usually involves taking the previous period’s budget as a starting point and making incremental changes to it. Expenditures are classified by line item (e.g., salaries, wages, and travel) and increments are added to reflect anticipated growth and/or inflation. In times of belt-tightening, budgets can be reduced, typically starting with the prior period’s budget and reducing the various line items. Unit heads become adept at game-playing: having &quot;fat&quot; in one’s budget means larger increases and less pain during cutbacks.</P>

<P>The structure of the SFPS school district budgets has been substantially determined by Handbook II (revised), which is a product of the National Center for Educational Statistics (entitled <I>Financial Account for Local and State School Systems</I>). The objective of Handbook II was to standardize district budgets to promote comparability. Each state mandates modifications to this basic chart of accounts to reflect the special and unique needs of their state and to be able to identify specific costs such as transportation, capital outlay, and textbooks, again for comparability and reporting requirements of authorizing legislation.</P>

<P>Typical school district line item budgets (fund, program, object, and location) have yielded the type of statistical data that legislative mandates have required. But, unlike the private sector, school district budgets have not provided a tool that permits education managers (e.g., superintendents, principals, and teachers) to make strategic process improvements that maximize service value to their customers (students, staff, and taxpayers).</P>

<P>Exhibit G reflects a typical line-item budget, while Exhibit H reflects an Activity-Based Costing budget. Compare these two exhibits to determine which better provides information that can be used to optimize, coordinate, and manage productivity.</P>

</FONT><P>The vast majority of respondents will easily conclude that ABC/M could provide managers, administrators, and staff members with performance data and cost information that can enable them to make &quot;informed&quot; decisions and to optimize the performance of each operational unit within the District.</P>

<P>It used to be that the rules of public school management were to:</P>


<UL>
<LI>accomplish missions as well as or just a bit better than the year before;</LI>
<LI>avoid scandal;</LI>
<LI>stay within the budget;</LI>
<LI>follow procedures; and</LI>
<LI>don’t spring any surprises on your Board of Education.</LI></UL>


<P>Administrators who did these things looked forward to good long careers. Life as a school administrator was predictable and secure--certainly in comparison to similar positions in the private sector.</P>

<P>Times have changed. Budgets are tighter, expectations are higher, clear-cut solutions are not apparent.</P>

<P>Almost every major educational initiative in the last decade of the twentieth century was directed to achieve a higher level of productivity in a more cost-effective manner.</P>

<P>At the core of this movement are two very important Federal Acts:</P>


<UL>
<LI>The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1992, and</LI>
<LI>The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993.</LI></UL>


<P>These acts require better cost management and include providing managers with better cost information.</P>

<P>These acts require the implementation of two new strategies that are having tremendous results in transforming organizations into learning and self-improving institutions. These strategies are known as ABC and ABM. ABC is Activity Based Costing (this will be addressed in more detail in Section 6.4.14) and ABM is Activity-Based Management</P>

<P>The ABC/M format can facilitate business management in which the process owners (i.e., the superintendents, principals, teachers, directors of maintenance, purchasing, MIS, personnel, payroll, etc.) have the opportunity to control and improve the activities/ processes that are the &quot;work&quot; of their respective areas of responsibility. The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board reports that activity-based costing has gained broad acceptance by manufacturing and service industries in the private sector by providing an effective managerial tool.</P>

<P>The practice in education has been to allocate resources where we think they are needed. That is, improve reading scores by adding reading specialist positions, improve attendance through automated attendance reporting procedures, reduce drug abuse by establishing a drug abuse position that disseminates information about drugs and the effects drugs have on our bodies.</P>

<P>Sometimes these strategies achieve their objectives. All too frequently however, the results are below expectation and only temporary.</P>

<P>Business leaders have long known the value of the alignment between (a) what they want to provide and produce (i.e., their mission, goals, and objectives), (b) what methods and processes they use, and (c) what quality control standards they apply to ensure the collection of specific data helpful for the refinement and optimization of their operational processes.</P>

<P>One major factor that has limited school district’s ability to change from a static bureaucracy to a dynamic, improvement-driven organization is the structure and the use of its budgetary information.</P>

<P>Activity budgets (ABC/M) are based on the dynamics of the processes of a school district and provide several perspectives on proposed actions. This makes ABC/M a real tool for change in a school district instead of the static document reports on expenditures that are currently used by the average school district.</P>

<P>This type of information (coupled with customer satisfaction data, student performance data, etc.) enables school district executives to take charge through a better understanding of how an organization operates and consumes its resources.</P>

<P>It is important for school district executives to understand that ABC/M is applicable to not only the business operations of a school district but is usually pertinent to their core mission of providing the best and most effective instruction delivery services.</P>

<P>The following example provides a sample illustration.</P>

</B></I><P>As mentioned in Section 5.3 above, the Board review process is typically a six-day cycle. On Thursday preceding a Board meeting, a packet of board reports (recommendations) is made available to Board members if they choose to attend a prescheduled Board Review Session. Unfortunately, Board members seldom attend these sessions. On Friday a complete Board Report packet is delivered to each Board member so that they can review the material prior to the Board meeting on the following Tuesday. Discussion on any agenda item can occur during the Tuesday Board meeting. This discussion occurs prior to voting &quot;yeah&quot; or &quot;nay.</P>

<P>Interviews were conducted with four of the five Board members (due to numerous schedule conflicts, Mr. Martinez was unavailable). Several themes emerged from these interviews.</P>


<UL>
<LI>Board members believe that their most important function is to represent various constituencies and to develop policies as guidelines for the functioning of the Santa Fe public schools.</LI>
<LI>Board members strongly believe that new members should receive training in areas such as:</LI></UL>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>how to read and understand budgets</LI>
<LI>the programmatic scope of the District</LI>
<LI>established policies of the District</LI>
<LI>the decision-making process of the Board</LI>
<LI>the legal provisions of the State regarding K-12 education, i.e.,  the Open Committees Act</LI>
<LI>funding sources and options</LI>
<LI>management information standards and reports</LI>
<LI>identification of key issues, e.g. appropriate questioning</LI>
<LI>role and responsibilities of the Superintendent</LI></UL>
</UL>


<UL>
<LI>Board members support the exploration of and the testing for use of standing subcommittees to better examine and analyze recommendations dealing with the use and control of the District’s $100,000,000 budget.</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>To substantially strengthen the Board’s review process the Board supports the following:</LI></UL>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Expand the time sequence to enable Board members to review and consider board reports through the establishment of standing committees;</LI>
<LI>Provide Board members access to expert specialists in areas such as finance, purchasing, personnel, transportation, performance assessment, technology, facilities, food service, etc.; and </LI>
<LI>Utilize standard report formats that require consistent information critical to good decision-making. (See recommendation 5.4.8.).</LI></UL>
</UL>


<P>Note: Based upon input from Board members, review of documents and board reports, benchmarking the review process with other school districts such as:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Charlotte-Mecklenburg, NC</LI>
<LI>Pasadena U.S.D., CA</LI>
<LI>Chicago Public Schools, IL</LI>
<LI>Scottsdale U.S.D., AZ</LI></UL>


<P>Board Rule 8195 states that &quot; . . . there shall be no standing committees . . . [but that] . . . temporary advisory committees may be formed for study and fact finding. . . &quot;</P>

<P>It is therefore recommended that the District take those steps necessary to obtain a &quot;waiver&quot; from the State to establish standing subcommittees of the Board.</P>

<P>The Board operates under and within the jurisdiction of several important policies and State statutes. The following citations will help the reader to understand the context in which elected citizens serve as members of the Santa Fe Board of Education.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<I><P>Orientation of New Board Members</I> (BP8150)</P>
<P>&#9;Each new member of the Board shall be afforded every opportunity to become oriented to the functions and responsibilities entailed by election to the Board. It shall be the duty of the Superintendent and the administrative staff to assist each new member-elect to understand the Board’s functions, policies, procedures, and the operation of the school system before he takes office.</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Meetings of the Board</I> (BP8220)</P>
<P>&#9;Regular meetings of the Board of the Santa Fe Public Schools will be held on the first (1st) and the third (3rd) Tuesday of each month. An agenda shall be prepared by the Superintendent in consultation with the president and sent to board members at least seventy-two (72) hours before the regular meeting. The time of the regular meeting of the Board of Education is 7:00 p.m. on the first (1st) and the third (3rd) Tuesday of each month. The place of the meeting is the boardroom unless otherwise specified.</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Remuneration and Reimbursement for Board Members</I> (BP8170)</P>
<P>&#9;School board members shall serve without compensation and shall not be employed in any capacity by the district during the term for which the member was elected. Board members incurring expense for board business shall be reimbursed according to state law.</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Methods of Operation: Board</I> (BP8120)</P>
<P>&#9;The Board of Education exercises legislative authority over the schools in accordance with applicable laws. It determines policy, delegates executive, supervisory and instructional authority to its employees, and appraises the results achieved in light of the goals of the school system.</P>

<P>&#9;The Board of Education shall concern itself primarily with broad questions of policy and with the appraisal of results rather than with administrative detail. The application of policies is an administrative task to be performed by the superintendent and his staff, and they shall be held responsible for the effective administration and supervision of the entire school system.</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Meetings of the Board: Order of Business </I>(BP8230)</P>
<P>&#9;Board of Education business will be conducted in a manner that generally includes the following elements in the format outlined below. The order of business or elements may be changed or amended by a majority vote of those present.</P>

</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Within the above-cited constraints and duties, the Board reviews, discusses and decides a multitude of diverse, complicated and significant issues typically over a six-day period to better &quot; . . . study and fact find. . . &quot; policy issues regarding District practices and proposals affecting:</P>


<UL>
<LI>finance</LI>
<LI>business operations</LI>
<LI>personnel</LI>
<LI>facilities</LI>
<LI>instruction and student achievement.</LI></UL>


<P>Until such time as a waiver is obtained from the State, the Board can establish &quot;temporary advisory committees&quot; to implement and pilot test this recommendation.</P>

<I><P>Suggested Number and Focus of Subcommittees:</P>
</I><P>Three &quot;standing&quot; subcommittees of the Board may be established around the areas mentioned above as follows:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Financial and Facilities: review strategies for best use of District fiscal resources and facilities.</LI>
<LI>Business Operations and Personnel: review matters of personnel and business operations including purchasing, contracting, food services, and transportation.</LI>
<LI>Instruction and Student Achievement: review curriculum, assess various program delivery systems, and monitor student achievement.</LI></UL>


<I><P>Suggested Composition of Subcommittees:</P>
</I><P>The President of the Board of Education shall appoint a Chair and one other Board member to constitute a two-member subcommittee. Membership on each subcommittee will be on a one-year basis or until the President of the Board determines that a membership change would be in the best interest of the Board and/or an individual Board member.</P>

<I><P>Suggested Subcommittee Meeting Schedule and Sequence:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</I><P>1.&#9;Subcommittee meetings may be held on the first (1st) and the third (3rd) Tuesday of each month and shall precede the meeting of the Committee of the Whole. (Subcommittee meeting schedules may need to be adjusted to accommodate Board member availability, since one Board member will required to participate on two subcommittees.)</P>

<P>2.&#9;For any agenda item submitted for Board review, the Superintendent must submit consideration and/or action to the President of the Board. The President will assign each agenda item to an appropriate subcommittee for review and discussion.</P>

<P>3.&#9;The subcommittee Chair shall establish its agenda accordingly for the purpose of study, fact-finding and determination of recommending appropriate action to the Committee of the Whole. No action can be taken by a subcommittee other than presenting a recommendation for action to the Board’s Committee of the Whole. Subcommittee recommendations will be based upon their independent and objective study of each agenda item. In this regard, it is further recommended that subcommittee Board members have access to a broad base of community expertise on a pro bono basis. These community resources can be drawn from a comprehensive resource directory that identifies individuals who have expertise in specific areas and are willing to be called upon to assist Board members to study and fact-find specific issues. For example, in the area of personnel, the Community Resource Director would list the name, telephone number, times and days of availability of each participant, along with the area of expertise/experience of that person.</P>

<P>Sample personnel areas of expertise could include:</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>recruitment</LI>
<LI>selection</LI>
<LI>assignment</LI>
<LI>assessment</LI>
<LI>salary and benefits</LI>
<LI>orientation and training</LI>
<LI>collective bargaining</LI>
<LI>job specifications</LI>
<LI>desk audits</LI>
<LI>grievance process</LI>
<LI>etc.</LI></UL>
</UL>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;These community resources would be invaluable to Board members in their quest to &quot; . . . faithfully and impartially discharge the duties of . . . office. . . .&quot;</P>

<P>4.&#9;The Board agenda item review sequence would be as follows:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>A.&#9;The Superintendent asks that an agenda item be placed before the Board of Education.</P>

<P>B.&#9;The President of the Board reviews the agenda item and assigns it to one of the subcommittees for study, fact-finding and recommendation.</P>

<P>C.&#9;The Subcommittee Chair develops each meeting agenda to:</P><DIR>

<P>1) &#9;review item</P>
<P>2) &#9;identify fact-finding questions and resources (e.g., staff and community resource expertise)</P>
<P>3)&#9;conduct study</P>
<P>4)&#9;develop subcommittee recommendation to be presented to the Committee of the Whole.</P>

</B></FONT><P>Financial executives know that change is required to compete in the marketplace, to meet increased demands for cost control, and to provide greater value to customers and stakeholders. Finance is at times characterized as overburdened by complex processes and controls. The Santa Fe New Mexico School District’s Financial Development and Operational Practices study indicates that there is a lack of planning and foresight and that drastic measures must be taken to improve the financial conditions of the district. It is obvious that personnel turnover and the following have led to this dysfunctional financial management environment:</P>


<UL>
<LI>lack of overall district strategic planning and vision</LI>
<LI>lack of the use of evaluation and accountability instruments</LI>
<LI>lack of training for staff, parents, and community</LI>
<LI>lack of technology use and business systems applications</LI></UL>

</B></I><P>As financial organizations transform their responsibilities from that of chief scorekeeper to that of value-added business partner, the need for proactive, consistent, and readily accessible information becomes linked to overall success of the business. This is, after all, a process of raising the bar for competitive success. Any organization adapting best practices undertakes to elevate its financial data to the level required for enhanced competitiveness. This is also applicable for organizations such as school districts. A best practice is defined as those practices used to achieve world-class performance in a given business function, process, or application. During the research phase of the engagement, 13 best practices from industry were identified as applicable to SFPS regarding budgeting, financial operations, and general management:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Activity Based Management (ABM) and/or Activity Based Costing (ABC)</LI>
<LI>Strategic planning drives all planning processes, especially operational and financial (capital and operating budgets)</LI>
<LI>Balanced Scorecard Approach for performance measurement</LI>
<LI>Performance indicators are aligned with business objectives, key result areas, and incentive plans</LI>

</B></I><P>Benchmarking is defined as the process for internally measuring an organization’s method, process, procedure, product, and service performance levels and comparing the results against those organizations that consistently distinguish themselves in that same category of performance. External benchmarking provides for best-practice examples and information that will lead to superior performance in specific processes and functions. Many areas are available for benchmarking analysis. Below are a few pertinent areas that are related to the budget only and another section related to financial and general management. These benchmarks are &quot;best in class&quot; measures versus &quot;average in class&quot; or &quot;worst in class&quot; for industry.</P>

</B></I><P>School districts develop their budgets based on a diverse set of formulas and allotments. Some school districts, such as San Diego, California, have specific allotments for each material category, while other school districts, such as Fairfax County, Virginia, tend to consolidate funds into a few accounts, providing them more flexibility. Appendix 11.4 details the formulas we gathered from other school districts that could assist SFPS.</P>

<P>PricewaterhouseCoopers<FONT SIZE=2> (</FONT>PwC) has developed a report that provides SFPS with expenditure benchmark data in all major categories and subcategories of a typical school district budget. The charts in the report depict data for a three-year period (i.e., Year 1 - 1994/95, Year 2 - 1995/96, Year 3 – 1996/97). These reports are located in Appendix 11.5.</P>

<P>PwC has requested SFPS staff to provide information so that expenditure benchmark data can be developed for SFPS. PwC is currently developing this information which will be added as an addendum to this report.</P>

</B></I><P>Customer and stakeholder involvement must be a part of the process and must be vigorous and inclusive. In the reengineered budget process, we recommend that many more stakeholders and customers become involved. Examples of these types of groups include: Chambers of Commerce, citizen groups, parent and teacher associations, professional educator associations, etc. This can be accomplished by briefing these groups on the District’s strategic plan and how the budget meets it. Other ways to involve customers and stakeholders include budget briefings by the Superintendent via cable television and through town hall meetings. The reengineered budget process dramatically increases customer and stakeholder involvement, which is important to any organization that wants to maximize satisfaction in its product. If this is achieved, customers will have a higher degree of loyalty and both customers and stakeholders will be less volatile in dealings with the organization. This increased interaction between the organization and its customers and stakeholders results in a more efficient and effective organization concerning its products and services.</P>

</B></I><P>Under the current process, it is unclear whether managers must prepare wish lists for all unresourced requirements (URRs) or for only a selected few. Under the new process it is recommended that Associate Superintendents and Department Directors create a list for all URRs but only forward their highest priority URRs for consideration; each URR should include a statement about how it addresses the district’s strategic plan. The departments would still maintain a complete listing of all URRs, but would only forward 10 for district prioritization. The departmental URRs would be prioritized by the BAC and approved or amended by the EBAC. The URRs from all departments could be prioritized into a district-level URR list from 1 to &quot;n&quot; or into a list of the top 10 or 20.</P>

</B></I><P>Currently there is no formal requirement for financial staff or account holders to reconcile their accounts/programs on a monthly basis with the accounting system. The purpose of conducting the reconciliation is to eliminate errors from the accounting system to ensure that funds are properly accounted for. If no reconciliation is performed, account/program managers will have reduced flexibility in executing their programs. This is due to fewer funds being available or more funds being available than there should be. Each department and all schools must be included in this monthly reconciliation. A formal record of the reconciliation should be kept for two years for historical and research purposes<FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman">.</P>

<P>During the review of the district’s current budget and last fiscal year’s expenditures, it became apparent that approximately 134 accounts out of a total of 225 accounts in the operational budget had variances exceeding 25% or $10,000. The District has provided information in an attempt to explain the variances. PwC does not feel that many of the explanations provide the appropriate rationale for the variances. Therefore, the District should have a thorough discussion concerning the variances in an effort to reduce some of the variances in order to generate funds for other, higher priority, programs.</P>

</B><P>Since the early 1980s, Fortune 500 companies and government agencies alike have been reaping the benefits of Activity Based Costing (ABC) systems. ABC is a methodology used to measure the cost of performing business and instructional processes and to trace these costs to specific products, and service processes. As a cost-reporting and management tool, ABC provides information on the resources (e.g., people, materials, equipment, facility space, etc.) used to accomplish an organization's mission. In addition to cost information, ABC also identifies an organization's processes and process boundaries; the people and organizational units involved in a process; the cost to execute single or multiple cycles of a process; process outputs (final products and services and work-in-process); and process customers. </P>

<P>Whereas traditional cost systems simply capture the cost of producing products and services, ABC calculates costs based on the relevant activities performed in producing products and services. These two methodologies differ in that the traditional method allocates cost through overhead rates and surcharges, while the ABC assigns costs based on causal relationships. By &quot;causal relationships&quot; we mean the alignment between what an organization wants to provide and produce (e.g., mission, goals, and objectives), what methods and processes they use, and what quality control standards they apply to ensure that specific data collection is helpful for the refinement and optimization of their operational processes. In short, you only pay for what you get. The figure below depicts traditional versus ABC methodologies.</P>

<FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Image11.gif" WIDTH=447 HEIGHT=313></P>
</FONT>
<P>ABC cost systems provide a more representative perspective of financial reality than traditional cost accounting systems because ABC systems trace, rather than allocate, resource costs to the activities they support. Allocation is the traditional practice of assigning some costs, such as overhead or indirect administrative and support expenses, by a certain formula, such as a multiple of direct labor costs. Allocation can be misleading because some processes consume more overhead than others do. In the private sector, this allocation problem causes managers to think that a certain product is profitable when in fact it loses money. The allocation problem may cause the organization to make a wrong decision or to make an inappropriate estimate of productivity or cost effectiveness--and mask the fact that administrative and support expenses are outstripping the direct cost of actually providing products and services to customers.</P>

<P>Using ABC information and a technique called value analysis, organizations can identify and eliminate or reduce resources going to activities that add cost and time, but not value, to the products and services delivered to customers. An example of this would be budget assistants and financial secretaries who correct errors in the accounting system that could have been eliminated if process improvements prevented errors in earlier activities. Other targets for improvement include redundant activities and outmoded regulations and procedures.</P>

<P>Another benefit of implementing an ABC system is the quantitative support it provides to process improvement and reengineering programs. ABC enables process improvement teams to capture valuable activity cost information for use in benchmarking, in process improvement evaluations, and in economic analyses to support investment justification. Activity costs can be used to target processes that offer the best opportunities for cost savings, enabling a systematic approach to process improvement.</P>

<P>We should note that ABC is not a cost <I>accounting</I> tool but a cost <I>management</I> tool. It should be used by managers, process improvement teams, and financial managers to gain control over their spending by gaining a clear understanding of how what they do on a daily basis translates into costs. As a process performance measure, cost data from an ABC system becomes a critical element to enabling process managers to achieve real, sustainable, and identifiable cost savings.</P>

<P>The figure below demonstrates the type of useful process/program management information that results from an ABC management system. The left side contains the type of information that can be found in most general ledger accounting summaries. Costs are recorded by expense category as they are programmed in the unit budget and give little indication of how the funds were actually used. However, once this data is applied to the ABC model and integrated with valuable process performance data, accurate activity costs are calculated. As a process/program manager, the information on the right-hand side is far more valuable than the roll-up of cost elements currently available. Ready access to ABC data enables managers to make decisions that have a quantifiable impact.</P>

</FONT><P>Only the creativity and resourcefulness of an organization’s personnel can limit the savings generated through the implementation of an ABC system. The process of developing the costing system will generate numerous process efficiencies--&quot;quick hits&quot;--that can be implemented almost immediately to streamline base operations by eliminating redundant and non-value-added work. Moreover, once the cost system is implemented, valuable cost information can be used as part of a continuous process improvement program to improve product quality and cost-effectiveness. Most important, process/program owners and financial managers will be in better control of how they spend their money to achieve mission goals, using ABC data for evaluating process improvement initiatives, forecasting and preparing budgets, and implementing mandated cost reductions on a more logical basis.</P>

</B><P>The development of ABC enabled an important step forward in process management. Now, processes could be managed with an accurate understanding of the cost incurred by those activities. This led to the evolution of Activity Based Management (ABM), the management of processes through the information gained from appropriately designed performance measurement systems and ABC.</P>

<P>ABC is a tool that gave decision-makers an accurate understanding of the costs incurred by activities. ABM is closely linked to ABC, but it is much more than ABC. ABM is a philosophy as well as a management approach. As a result, implementing ABM is a much larger task and challenge than implementing ABC.</P>

<P>Unlike ABC, ABM is not focused on providing data, but on changing behavior. ABM is the management of processes through the information gained from ABC and from appropriately designed performance measurement systems (see figure below). It is therefore essential that ABM implementation consider the overall system within which it is to be implemented. Management decision-making processes must typically be modified, and organizational structures may even need to be realigned. In most organizations, implementing ABM requires an adjustment in the values and beliefs of the organizational culture. It also necessitates alignment of personnel appraisal systems to ensure that individual motivations are consistent with organizational goals and objectives.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Image13.gif" WIDTH=553 HEIGHT=236></P>
</B>
<P>Unfortunately, the challenges of implementing ABM are all too often discounted. Organizations frequently hold the view that ABM is simply ABC, entailing only the implementation of a software package. This view is dangerous because it undermines the importance of any ABM initiative. ABM is a management philosophy that requires certain &quot;tools&quot; in order to operate. These tools include the cost management and performance management structures and underlying information technology support, integrated in a fashion that yields relevant information to decision-makers concerning effectiveness, efficiency, and value (see figure below).</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial"><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Image14.gif" WIDTH=546 HEIGHT=412></P>
</FONT>
<P>However, simply providing the right information to the decision-maker does not mean that the data will be used. Changing individuals’ decision-making behavior and better aligning that behavior with the needs of the organization require a number of steps.</P>

<P>First, there must be an understanding on the part of the decision-maker as to the needs of the organization. A lack of understanding of underlying personnel issues, for example, may cause decision-makers to be satisfied with the status quo. </P>

<P>Second, decision-makers must be motivated to act once an understanding of the need for change and the role that ABM can play in effecting the needed change has been gained (see figure below). If, for example, performance appraisal systems are not aligned with the needs of the organization in an ABM environment, decision-makers may be motivated to act in a direction counter to that indicated by ABC data. It is important to align individual and organizational objectives.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Image15.gif" WIDTH=533 HEIGHT=328></P>
</B>
<P>Third, a decision-maker needs the necessary information on which to act. This is where the tools of ABC and performance management come into play. When appropriately applied, the tools support taking action that is better aligned with meeting overall organizational needs. </P>

<P>Finally, the action of all levels of the organization, both instructional and noninstructional, must also be in alignment. For example, if mid-level managers are told to use ABM, but senior-level management does not openly support its use, then mid-level managers will be discouraged.</P>

<P>Any individual or organization attempting to implement ABM must recognize that results are not achieved simply by building models or implementing software. They are achieved by the following:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Understanding the business and instructional delivery needs of the organization</LI>
<LI>Recognizing how improved cost and performance information can improve the decision-making process to achieve greater value and performance</LI>
<LI>Knowing that cultural, process, organizational, and technological impediments can be overcome to allow the development of a true ABM environment.</LI></UL>


<P>The Superintendent should implement this recommendation beginning in the next fiscal year. To develop a District-wide ABC model will take approximately one year and will cost approximately $350,000 to $850,000, depending on the extent of implementation. It is also recommended that the establishment of a full-time position as the ABC model sustainer be created which will cost the district from $25,000 to $35,000 annually. <B>(Note:</B> <B>These costs are the same as those reflected in paragraph 5.4.6.2 and are depicted here merely for information and are not additional).</P>

</B></I><P>Members of the EBAC and BAC require monthly executive-level budget execution reports that are succinct and understandable to people who are not involved in budget process preparation. Currently, personnel directly involved in the budget as their daily duty are generally the only ones who understand the monthly budget execution reports, since they are basically accounting reports. That is, the reports present execution data by accounting code rather than by the name of the program and do not contain any narrative analysis. The executive-level reports should be made available to the School Board and other customers and stakeholders.</P>

<P>The Superintendent should implement this recommendation next fiscal year. There are no financial implications for this recommendation in that no additional resources are required</P>

<P>Lack of communication causes disenfranchisement of the District’s customers and, as a result, the achievement of the District’s goals and objectives are jeopardized.</P>

<P>There are several important communication points worth noting:</P>
<OL>

<LI>Communicate the budget assumptions in a concise document to all District employees who contribute to the budget preparation annually.</LI>
<LI>Redefine administrative policies such as the following:</LI></OL>



<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Process for replacing worn-out equipment (i.e., copy machines)</LI>
<LI>Process for carryover of funds between fiscal years</LI></UL>
</UL>


<OL>

<LI>Inform the District employees which programs have been funded and why, preferably at the budget staff meeting with each department.</LI>
<LI>If a budget reset is to take place, budget staff need to meet with the affected department heads to explain why, how much it will cost, and what the impact will be.</LI></OL>


<P>By improving communications with SFPS staff, the budget department will foster the team environment that needs to be developed to achieve the School District’s goals and objectives.</P>

<P>The budget document, published each year as the approved budget, is very difficult to understand unless one works closely with the budget on a daily basis. In numerous interviews, SFPS staff and board personnel stated that the document is not user-friendly. They indicated the difficulty of finding an answer quickly due to the way the information is arranged, the manner in which data is presented, and the lack of an executive summary for the nonbudget person.</P>

<P>The budget document should be both a management and financial tool. It must present both data and information. The following recommendations relate to format and presentation of data:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Include an executive summary in the front of the document that details the following:</LI></OL>



<UL>

<UL>
<LI>How the budget accomplishes the strategic plan’s goals and objectives (section on each goal and objective)</LI>
<LI>Changes in program funding levels from prior year/s and rationale</LI>

<OL START=4>

<LI>Show and discuss budget assumptions.</LI>

<LI>Discuss formulas.</LI>

<LI>Display funding in the following graphical manner and provide a narrative explaining the program and the changes from previous years and the rationale behind the changes. Also, graphically display and describe each subprogram in the same way as the major program. (Note: Not all of the District’s funding programs are depicted in the template below.)</LI>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Image16.gif" WIDTH=546 HEIGHT=412></P>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>8.&#9;Put the document on-line for all SFPS personnel, School Board personnel, customers, and stakeholders.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Overall, the budget document must give personnel more information along with the data. The document requires more narrative explanation. Currently, the published budget does not provide enough explanation. The document is very data-oriented, and the data is mostly presented in a spreadsheet format that requires the individual to search for answers instead of having easy access to them.</P>

<P>The Superintendent should implement this recommendation in the next year of the budget development process. There are no financial implications for this recommendation in that no additional resources are required</P>

</B></I><P>In order for the budget process to run efficiently and effectively, it is recommended that the finance department, or another District-designated management accountability/performance office, set up monthly communications processeseseith its internal customers (departments/divisions/schools). This communications processes should take several forms.</P>

<P>First, the internal customers need written information from Finance on the goals and objectives of the school system as developed in the strategic plan, as well as the corresponding budget assumptions.</P>

<P>Next, upon development and approval of the budget, the internal customers need to be informed in writing by Finance whether their programs have been funded and what the rationale was for the decisions that were made. As the school year progresses, the Finance Department needs to set up monthly &quot;exception&quot; meetings with their customers to review programs that are not on target (as illustrated by the performance measures) and discuss corresponding corrective actions that can be taken to get back on track. </P>

<P>Finally, it is important for customer buy-in that any budget changes anticipated during the year be discussed in person with those affected prior to the budget change actually being implemented. By communicating with customers, the Finance Department and its customers can work as a team to use finite resources in the most efficient manner to achieve the District’s goals and objectives.</P>

<P>The Superintendent should implement this recommendation immediately. There are no financial implications for this recommendation in that no additional resources are required.</P>

</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of information technology to the educational process, both in delivering and managing education activities, is recognized clearly by the Santa Fe Public School District. A framework for its efficient and effective use is being set, aiming to achieve the full benefits of its potential. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although restrained by a series of changes in the management structure of the District, the status of technology has benefited from the collective vision of previous and current administrations. It is most evident in the evolving infrastructure. Connectivity exists to all school sites and District office locations. The upgrades occurring now, coupled with a continued emphasis on hardware availability, position the District to take advantage of the ever-increasing number of tools capable of improving productivity and ultimately impacting learning. However the potential offered by the advances made to date is being lost rapidly even as new initiatives bring forth more advanced capabilities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>Many of the District’s processes that center on data collection and reporting are isolated, limiting the possibilities for discovery that occur when data is integrated. While business applications are abundant, they both create and support the isolation. Having exacted the improvements in productivity for which they were implemented initially, these systems now actually inhibit productivity growth as the expectations of their technologically savvy users far exceed their capacities. </P>

<P>As currently structured, the management of technology and data inhibits the District’s ability to build a consolidated vision and the accompanying standards and policies to support it. In some cases, independent department and school decisions about technology (hardware and software) are being made without an understanding of the need to interrelate with previous decisions and are potentially imposing an unsupportable burden on the resources of the District. Manageability is key to effectiveness. Consolidating the direction-setting responsibility for technology and formulating the policies and procedures to support the direction are key to achieving that manageability.</P>

<P>Staff development and funding issues are ongoing in the Santa Fe School District, as they are in all school districts. Recognizing that neither can be provided fully by the District, continuous outreach into the local and national communities bridges the gap. Training needs mapped out into a long-term plan to develop staff permit the identification of community resources with which to build partnerships. Funding needs mapped to long-term technology initiatives bring focus to the cost of technology-enhanced education, setting realistic expectations and providing powerful lobbying tools. The impact of technology on the District is being constrained without greater community dependence and the adoption of longer-term views for funding and staff development.</P>
<P> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increasing demand for the assistance of technology in education management and accountability as well as in instruction is evident in the District office and in the schools visited. However, without a long-term plan that formulates a clear strategic direction and delineates the steps to achieve it, the District runs the risk of spending a large amount of money on high-profile items that won’t contribute at their maximum potential.</P>

<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558574"><B>Business Systems Support</A></LI>
</B><P>The District’s day-to-day business functions are performed with the assistance of an integrated suite of applications known as CIMSIII from National Computer Systems (NCS). The system has been in use since 1987. The modules supporting the business offices include financial (FMS: general ledger, purchasing, A/P, A/R, cash disbursements, cash receipts), employee (EMS including payroll), human resource (HMS), fixed asset (FAS), and warehouse management (WHS). A student information management module (SMS) supports school offices. </P>

<P>All school sites are connected to the District, giving them access to the District’s financial and student information management applications. School offices utilize CIMSIII to enter purchase requisitions and view certain financial accounts. Elementary schools enter daily attendance data while middle and high schools can enter daily attendance (via scan sheets), grades, and student schedules (utilizing the scheduler).</P>
<P><A NAME="DATAMANAGMENT"></A></P>
<P>Additional business systems available to District offices and schools include: ACT1000, which allows posting of work orders to the Maintenance Department; SNAP Cafeteria Management, which tracks student lunch purchases as well as free and reduced lunch eligibility; TSSI, which allows staff members to record their absences and arrange substitutes; and Microsoft Office 97/98 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Access), which enables the District to share correspondence, spreadsheets, etc. among users without experiencing incompatibilities.</P>

<P>The Technology Resource Center supports each of these applications and other business-related capabilities, some directly and some indirectly. Its indirect support ensures that each application is available and running properly. Its direct involvement varies with the application or capability.</P>

<P>The TRC is involved directly with the issuance of payroll to District personnel. It performs direct deposit test transmissions twice a month and coordinates the actual direct deposit. The Systems Operator then performs the actual printing, envelope stuffing, and distribution of check stubs. Payroll issuance requires ten to 12 hours twice a month.</P>

<P>The Human Resources Department works closely with the TRC staff to post job positions on the District’s web site. While these requests are sporadic, they represent several hours per week.</P>

<P>The TRC maintains the database that houses the student data collected by the schools on 13,400 students. Since the majority of funding from the State of New Mexico is contingent on the accuracy and timeliness of submission of data from this database, a considerable amount of time is spent preparing it. Four positions are devoted full-time to the collection and verification of the student-related data (e.g., demographics, class schedules, and teacher assignments) required for electronic submission to the State Department of Education’s Accountability Data System (ADS). Each staff member works with a set of assigned schools to ensure that the membership data represented in the student information management system is accurate and in balance. In addition, responding to its own evaluation of the quality of the data collected prior to the 1999-2000 school year, the TRC assumed responsibility for the entry of selected data. Restricting the data entered by the schools, centralized yearly student registration was enacted, requiring significant involvement of certain TRC staff (on ten-month contract) prior to and at the beginning of the school year. Continuous data maintenance occurs throughout the year as well, including the collection and entry of student discipline incidents.</P>

<P>Prior to submission of ADS data (40<SUP>th</SUP>/80<SUP>th</SUP>/Dec 1<SUP>st</SUP>/120<SUP>th</SUP>/last school day), the TRC keys in outstanding student data updates, free and reduced lunch data from SNAPS, and transportation data from the transportation system. A quick validation is performed to determine that the files are built properly and a detailed validation is performed to determine that the data meets validation rules. All errors are corrected and a copy is made prior to submitting the ASCII file to the State Department via FTP. Corrections are made to the save file if errors are found by the State. Reports generated by the State when the data is accepted are distributed by the TRC as received.</P>

<P>In addition to data management by the TRC, each secondary school requires weekly printing and distribution of attendance forms, requiring three hours per week from the Systems Operator. The Operator also coordinates the printing of report cards, class schedules, and transcripts. Grades are processed every four weeks, student schedules as needed, and transcripts yearly.</P>

<P>School assignment is also handled by the TRC. This includes requests from parents for transfers between school zones.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558575"><B>Application/Report Development</A></LI>
</B><P>Numerous predefined business and student data reports are generated and distributed District-wide through the internal mail system, requiring up to four hours per day for the Systems Operator. However, the demand for custom reports is growing. Governmental agencies and private citizens request special reports. The State audit and grand jury investigation as well as increased emphasis on accountability have created a need for other new reports and different variations of existing reports. Currently consuming up to three hours per day, the data research and report production is anticipated to continue to increase.</P>

<P>Other data requests, such as the data files required by the State Department of Education for the Accountability Data System, require programming by internal staff as well as contracted services in cooperation with other New Mexico school districts. The specifications for such requests continue to evolve. Their complexity evolves also as system modifications are required to capture new data.</P>

<P>Generation of these reports requires an in-depth knowledge of AS400 Query, a tool useful only for the AS400. System modifications require RPG, a programming language no longer widely used. Due to the specialized nature of these tools, the data contained in the District’s data stores is not easily accessible by the data users without considerable training. Therefore, the District is dependent on the TRC staff to produce reports that represent the different views of data needed to operate efficiently.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558576"><B>Hardware Support</A></LI>
</B><P>The TRC maintains a complete computer repair facility and its personnel repair any computer within the District that experiences some form of failure, including school computer lab and classroom equipment. Upgrades in memory and hard disk space are performed as well as the set-up and configuration of new stand-alone and networked computers. All peripheral equipment, including scanners and printers, is maintained and repaired. Almost all equipment maintenance and repair is performed on-site and usually with a turnaround time of less than 72 hours.</P>

<P>The central hardware platform for the District is a five-year-old IBM AS/400 midrange computer, accessible throughout the District. It has a 31 GB storage capacity and uses a five-disk RAID architecture that provides fault tolerance for data integrity. The system is capable of full backup/restore on either reel-to-reel or 8-millimeter tape and is connected to an uninterrupted power supply. Two IBM line printers provide high-speed report printing. The District’s Business Office, Transportation, Food Service and Maintenance/ Warehouse Departments use Windows-based Pentium-class computers (with the exception of a few Apple Macintosh computers) that are linked to the AS400. </P>

<P>The TRC also maintains at the District office an email server, a web server and a database server. The email server is a Compaq Proliant running Netscape POP3 email services. The web server is a Digital Equipment Dec-Alpha. The Database server is a Compaq Proliant running Windows NT, recently installed to provide a search capability for staff members to access SFPS Board policies, bargaining agreements, etc. </P>

<P>Both Apple Macintosh and IBM-compatible, Pentium, Windows-based personal computers are mixed throughout the schools. In addition, all schools maintain file servers, mainly for instructional purposes.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558577"><B>Communications/Networking Support</A></LI>
</B><P>The TRC maintains all data and voice communications for the District’s business office and schools, working closely with US West, the District’s telephone provider and data line carrier. Voice communications include landline phones, cellular phones, and pagers. Provided services include maintenance and repair of all handsets, PBX stations, and internal wiring. For data communications the TRC staff monitors and maintains data connections.</P>

<P>Currently all school sites are connected to the District, giving them access to email, the Internet, and the District’s financial and student information management applications. </P>
<P>Typically, elementary school sites have two computers that have this connection. Middle schools typically have six to seven connected computers, as school counselors require connectivity for student class scheduling. The high school configuration will have ten to 14 to provide connectivity for their staff. </P>

<P>The existing wide area network consists of a patchwork of both a 56-Kb frame relay structure as well as some point-to-point 56Kb (dial-up) or T-1 data lines (high schools). All data lines terminate at the District office. Each school site has a Cisco 2600 communications router. The District office maintains a Cisco 7206 router, with a T-1 data line, to access the Internet Service Provider (ISP) in Albuquerque.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558578"><B>System Administration</A></LI>
</B><P>The District maintains backup tapes for all of its business and student data. Full system backups, which include both the computer programs and data, are updated once per month or whenever a program upgrade has been installed. All data is backed up nightly and tapes are rotated on a daily basis for fourteen days. The most current data tape is stored off-site. </P>

<P>Security is administered by the TRC for all appropriate electronic devices. Internet web site filtering is in place along with a firewall (Cisco PIX) to prevent unwanted access to District data sources via the Internet. User IDs and passwords are also maintained to ensure controlled access to CIMSIII business systems.</P>

<P>Software that manages communications between software applications and between computer platforms is also managed by the TRC. This software includes: Pro Logic, which links TSSI to CIMSIII, allowing the transfer of substitute information to the payroll module for paycheck issuance; Ralley Attachmate, which provides emulation required for a personal computer to connect to the AS/400 and translates the language used by it; Netscape Communicator, which allows access to the Internet; and Netscape and Eudora, which are used for email services.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558579"><B>User Support</A></LI>
</B><P>The District has established a centralized help desk (954-HELP) to support users in the operation of standard software applications and to receive and manage requests for maintenance. Only one position is allocated to this responsibility. It is currently vacant due to a lack of response to advertising, assumed to be the result of the low salary level ($18,000).</P>

<P>The TRC receives requests from both the District office and school users for support in the operation of the business systems software - CIMSIII, the Microsoft Office 97/98 suite of applications, as well as all other District systems and hardware listed in Appendix 11.15 Preliminary Inventory of Core Hardware and Software. Requests for maintenance and report generation (both standard and custom) are received constantly with priorities being set and tracked by TRC staff.</P>

<P>An additional support structure for schools has been established by the District that depends on teachers who have been designated and trained as Computer Site Representatives (CSRs). For a yearly stipend of between $800 and $1,500 (based on the number of students, computers, and teachers at a site), these teachers agree to provide support at their schools for hardware and software problems as well as assist in training and technology integration. </P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558580"><B>Training/Staff Development</A></LI>
</B><P>The TRC provides a wide range of training - free of charge - to all staff members within the District. A monthly calendar is published and distributed. Beginning, intermediate, and advanced instruction is offered on the Microsoft Office suite of software products to assist staff members with their daily correspondence and data analysis. Also provided are courses about email, the Internet, and networking fundamentals as well as technology integration into the curriculum.</P>

<P>A Technology Learning Center (TLC) has been equipped to deliver training for up to 24 individuals. TRC personnel offer training at the TLC according to the published schedule; they also provide on-site training several times a month. Training courses generally last about three hours and can be arranged for either morning or afternoon sessions. </P>

<P>District procedures state that teacher training in technology should be part of a teacher’s professional development plan. This policy, along with the need to ensure that Computer Site Representatives are kept up-to-date, requires the TRC to maintain a constant schedule of training activities.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558581"><B>Technology Direction</A></LI></OL>

</OL>

</B><P>The Technology Resource Center is responsible for setting the direction for technology within the District. The Executive Director is tasked with creating the yearly District-wide Technology Plan and ensuring that it is compatible with the District’s Education Plan for Student Success (EPSS). Concurrent with District planning, assistance is given to schools in the development of their site plans, which are required every three years. Also, to ensure that school purchases are in line with the District’s plan for technology, all hardware and software purchases are expected to be approved by the Executive Director. Although no standards are published for hardware purchases, this approval process helps ensure that hardware is appropriate for its intended use, that it can be supported by the TRC, and that it is compatible with the District’s direction.</P>

</B></I><P>Technology planning has occurred for the past few years. Although long-range plans existed informally, only yearly plans that tied loosely to the Board’s goals and the District’s Education Plan for Student Success were produced. No plans related to the District’s long-range technology goals were produced. Current management expects to begin a strategic planning process this year to establish a three- to five-year focus. However, to date the State Department’s requirement for a yearly plan has taken precedence.</P>

<P>A sample of the informally adopted goals includes:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Achieve a 4 to 1 student-to-computer ratio</LI>
<LI>Provide email capability to the desktop of every staff member, including teachers</LI>
<LI>Replace computer hardware on a five-year cycle</LI>
<LI>Prepare all schools for voice, data, and video</LI>
<LI>Improve data availability.</LI></UL>

<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558583"><B>Achieve a 4 To 1 Student-to-Computer Ratio</A></LI>
</B><P>Currently estimated at 5 to 1, a revised goal of a 4 to 1 student-to-<I>high-end</I> computer (i.e., capable of multimedia and Internet access) ratio has been set. Progress toward this goal is estimated to be closer to 8/10 to 1. Schools have indicated that the pace at which this goal is being met is acceptable.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558584"><B>Provide Email Capability to the Desktop of Every Staff Member, Including Teachers</A></LI>
</B><P>Email access from each desktop is rapidly becoming a reality. All principals and assistant principals have email and it is estimated that 95% of teachers have access to email. The remaining 5% include positions such as nurses and teachers who occupy temporary classrooms, which are cost-prohibitive to wire. This year’s E-rate application includes a request for funding wireless networking equipment to accommodate temporary locations.</P>

<P>The use of email is considerably less than its availability. To reduce the cost of correspondence and take advantage of the speed offered by email, the District Superintendent announced at a scheduled District meeting with principals and assistant principals that they must check their email once or twice daily. District correspondence will be delivered primarily via email. Some principals are recognizing the value of electronic correspondence and are delivering their faculty information via email.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558585"><B>Replace Computer Hardware on a Five-Year Cycle</A></LI>
</B><P>Equipment replacements occur now on a funds-available, priority-needs basis. A cycle for replacement would ensure that all equipment is technologically current and would provide an equitable allotment method. An obvious impediment is funding. While the current Mill Levy funds (SB9) provide a steady revenue stream, the current funding will last only two more years. Although the District intends to ask for another four years of funding, there is no guarantee of continual funding to achieve the envisioned hardware replacement cycle.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558586"><B>Prepare All Schools for Voice, Data, and Video</A></LI>
</B><P>The initiatives listed in the next section reflect the progress being made by the District toward achieving this goal.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558587"><B>Improve Data Availability</A></LI></OL>
</OL>
</OL>
</OL>

</B><P>Two initiatives were envisioned to improve the availability of data. A Data Warehouse was identified as a vehicle for providing data to the State Department as well as to local users. A new student information management system was identified as the vehicle to give schools better access to student data. Neither initiative was attempted due to budget constraints.</P>

<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558589"><B>Y2K Preparation</A></LI>
</B><P>Considerable effort has been expended for many months in preparation for the new millennium and possible problems created by the computer representation of dates. Both hardware and software were tested for Y2K compliance and all known offenders were either modified or replaced. Extensive contingency plans included powering down equipment just prior to the new year and bringing it back on-line in isolation in the new year to allow for any final remediation in a controlled manner. Except for a few minor difficulties encountered in bringing computer equipment back on-line, most likely unrelated to Y2K, the new year was ushered in without impacting operations.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558590"><B>Network Infrastructure Upgrade</A></LI>
</B><P>The network communications infrastructure is being reconfigured currently. The patchwork of 56Kb frame relay, and point-to-point 56Kb and T-1 data lines is being replaced. One DS-3 line (T-3, 45 Mb), a fiber optic cable which is the equivalent of 28 T-1 lines wrapped together, will feed into the District office with point-to-point (straight connect) T-1 lines terminating at 27 school sites. The 28<SUP>th</SUP> line will be used in frame relay running at 56Kb connecting the remaining sites with low volume data needs: the Warehouse and Food Services departments, Alvord Elementary, Tesuque Elementary, Acequia Madre, and the Early Childhood Facility.</P>

<P>This new data line configuration will enhance greately all communications between the school sites, the District office and beyond, by eliminating the need to dial-in and by providing increased speed. In addition, US West will relieve the TRC of the responsibility for monitoring the network’s integrity while reducing the monthly communications charges from approximately $9,000 to $6,000.</P>

<P>Plans are being formulated that could allow the telephone to share these upgraded data lines (voice over IP data lines), with the introduction of a necessary router that can dynamically allocate the lines’ usage. The result would be the elimination of the current Centrex telephone system costs and support while reducing complexity in the overall infrastructure. Although the TRC would be responsible for the telephone support, this approach creates a structure that, if properly equipped, can enable staff, including teachers, to use the computer on their desktop as a telephone.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558591"><B>AS/400 Upgrade</A></LI>
</B><P>An upgrade is being planned for the AS/400 that houses the District’s business services’ (including student data management) software applications. The upgrade will increase capacity as well as migrate from the CISC operating system to a RISC platform. The current hardware is operating at 85% capacity, which is approaching the limit recommended for its use, and the CISC (V3Rs) operating system is being phased out by the vendor in favor of the faster and more efficient RISC platform. The upgraded AS/400 will have 77 GB 8 disk RAID storage capacity as well as increased RAM and cache storage, doubling the current memory and disk space. Performance is being monitored to determine if the proposed memory and disk space is adequate. (Note: the purchase order for $110,000 is currently on hold pending the outcome of this assessment.)</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558592"><B>Student Information Management System Replacement</A> </LI>
</B><P>The District has pursued twice a replacement for the student information management module of CIMSIII. An NCS product, MicroCIMS, was purchased and attempted. SFPS did not like the product and it was eventually dropped by NCS. The software was returned and the District received credit toward other software and maintenance fees. Recently another search for a replacement was conducted. An example of software found is Open+, which runs on Windows NT, for an estimated cost of $200,000. Another NT based offering is Tremont, which is a complete software solution containing financial, human resource, and student management capabilities. Budgetary restrictions have terminated the research.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558593"><B>Library Automation</A></LI>
</B><P>A two year project began this year to convert all schools (using three different legacy systems) to the newly acquired library automation software SIRSI. Eleven schools are currently on-line and beginning to reap the anticipated benefits. Classroom searches of both local and District library collections are available. Internet access also enables evening and weekend searches, providing a readily available online Teacher and Family Resource Center. </P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558594"><B>Cafeteria Automation</A> </LI>
</B><P>The SNAP Cafeteria Management System, funded by the Board this year, completed its pilot and is now running in eight schools. Implemented as a tool to gain control over expenditures, it enables smarter purchases by tracking what students are consuming. It also records any student’s pre-payment for lunch, creating an account from which students may draw rather than paying each day. In addition, it enables the tracking of free and reduced lunch purchases and costs. Each night data is captured from cafeterias and uploaded via the District’s Wide Area Network (WAN) to the Student Nutrition Office where all federal reports required for reimbursement are produced along with other management level reporting.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558595"><B>Student Education/Career Management</A></LI>
</B><P>School-to-Work software, installed on the District’s database server, is being piloted by both high schools to maintain students’ career development plans, competencies, post-secondary choices, employment information, etc. It maintains a four-year graduation plan for a student, including courses taken, identifying course credits received and remaining. It tracks test scores, GPAs, and awards, and provides a query capability allowing the identification of students eligible for scholarships, grants, etc. based on user-defined criteria. Its import/export capability allows data from other systems to be merged as well as exports data to other systems such as student information management systems. Currently it is not integrated with the CIMSIII student information module.</P>

</B><P>A grant is being written to acquire $160,000 from the legislature to upgrade the computers and fully implement the Accelerated Reader and Math programs in four schools. Currently this software is being used successfully in a limited capacity. The upgrade will improve the performance of the software and extend its availability.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558597"><B>Hardware and Software Inventory</A></LI>
</B><P>In preparation for assessing District needs for hardware, an inventory of the hardware and software currently in use in schools and the District office has begun. This inventory also will serve to indicate how well the District is progressing toward reaching its goals. Information is being gathered that will distinguish between the number of computers in place and the number that are capable of running technologically current software programs.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558598"><B>Internet Provider Change</A></LI>
</B><P>US West is now in the Internet market and maintains an access point in Santa Fe. Access could be provided locally, using the wiring infrastructure currently being installed, and possibly reducing the current cost (point-to-point T-1 connection to Albuquerque) from $1,500 to $600 a month. Also, it may be possible to utilize an ATM switch enabling the purchase of extra bandwidth in increments, thereby increasing speed as needed, for $30 per month/extra Mb.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558599"><B>Internet Filtering Equipment Replacement</A> </LI>
</B><P>The current Internet filtering equipment (BESS) is being considered for replacement. It is old and it requires that both the software and hardware be bought from the same company, restricting the District’s choices. If US West is selected to provide Internet access, it can provide the filtering on their equipment and manage it. It is reported to be updated constantly to keep current with the daily proliferation of Internet sites.</P>

</B><P>The capability to stream video into classrooms is becoming a reality with the wiring infrastructure upgrades occurring now. Utilizing a satellite disk to down link programs along with hardware/software to compress and send video images over the network and track subscriptions, all schools that choose to subscribe could be receiving video broadcasts as early as the next school year. The District currently has 2-3 stations from which to broadcast. The estimated cost of $50,000 is expected to be covered by E-rate funds being applied for now.</P>

</B></I><P>Technology for the Santa Fe Public Schools is funded from three main sources: State allocations, Mill Levy funds, and grants. State funds are non-categorical, used to support general operations. Mill Levy funds support technology that impacts students, not administration. The 1999-2000 school year is the second in its four year funding stream. Grants are received from the legislatively funded Technology for Education Act. A per student allocation of $14.08 was received for the 1999-2000 school year. Other grants are direct legislative appropriations that result from targeted proposals submitted by the District to support capital outlay projects. </P>

</B></I><P>Substantial progress is being made toward the accomplishment of technology goals set forth by the Santa Fe School District in a very aggressive and comprehensive Technology Plan. The following observations support the elevation of this plan to a strategic and vision-setting plan that can help ensure focus and maintain continuity over a span of years.</P>


<UL>
<LI>The Technology Plan represents the goals for 1999-2000, not the goals for the next three to five years. </LI>
<LI>The Technology Plan does not contain a vehicle to quantify its goals and publicize its progress. Further, it does not appear that there is an assessment of the District’s needs and how the plan addresses them, or an evaluation of the level of expertise needed to implement the plan successfully. </LI>
<LI>Technology Plans are currently in place for each of the District’s schools, with a schedule for updating them. The District reviews the plans and uses the information in them to determine the level of funding to be allocated to each school. Plans are developed with the assistance of local planning committees, generally including nonpublic school input, such as parents and businesses. However, the District’s plan does not reference individual school technology priorities, nor are these priorities and their status published publicly to demonstrate progress.</LI>
<LI>Decisions about the direction of technology are being made at the District level without a formal mechanism for including the counsel of all stakeholders. While school input is received, the perception of schools is that the District’s technology decisions are make independent of public input.</LI>
<LI>The plans and accomplishments to date represent a significant effort and a clear vision of where technology itself needs to be directed. However, an understanding of the District’s plan for its effective use varies. An expressed need is a shared vision for its potential and a planned sequence of long-range activities to achieve it. In many instances, personalities are driving its use and students’ exposure and learning opportunities vary accordingly.</LI></UL>

</B></I><P>Schools and the District are being readied for sophisticated computing with currently initiated and planned upgrades in the technology infrastructure that can support voice, video, and data. As the vision for its use is being developed, the following observations may have an impact.</P>


<UL>
<LI>Different vendors’ hardware and new operating systems are being incorporated into an environment previously dominated by the AS/400 along with PCs and MACs without a long-term view of the potential need for interoperability. The District currently is experiencing redundant data processing and isolated data pools due to systems that cannot or have not been made to share. The risk, without a well-defined architecture reflecting its users’ need, is an increase in the incidence of current data problems along with an increase in the need for system support resources.</LI>
<LI>The AS/400 hardware supporting the District’s business systems is being upgraded to &quot;alleviate its capacity inadequacy&quot; and to replace the operating system that is being phased out by the vendor. <I>(</I>See section 7.2.3.3, above<I>.)</I>. The planned upgrade represents a substantial monetary commitment of $110,000. (Note: the replacement cost is funded through an $80,000 legislative grant and a $30,000 budget adjustment in the operational budget allocating funds previously designated for a Data Warehousing project that lost priority.) There is an obvious need to move quickly to provide adequate housing for the District’s business systems; however, a clear opportunity exists to evaluate the desirability of the current technology and upgrade plans for the AS/400 as an integral part of the District’s long-term planning. </LI>
<LI>The Transportation Department maintains its own AS/400, mostly outside of the direction and oversight of the TRC. Programming and support is provided through resources contracted by the Department.</LI>
<LI>The District has expressed that compatibility with the State Department of Education’s infrastructure is important in carrying out its responsibilities. As the District determines its infrastructure direction, the fact that the State is planning to phase out the AS/400 should be considered. The State reports that it is not integrated easily without other assistive technologies and without great expense. It costs $40,000/year to maintain and it is underutilized. Plans call for standardizing on a Unix/NT platform combination, with the recognition that Unix system administrators are few and that they are very expensive.</LI></UL>

</B></I><P>The general consensus among the users of the District’s business systems is that they are inadequate to meet the expectations of increasingly technology literate personnel as well as the continually expanding data needs of the schools, the District, the State Department of Education, and the Federal Government.</P>
<OL>

<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558607"><B>The CIMSIII Software</A></LI>
</B><P>The CIMSIII software, in use since 1987, serves basically as a tool for data collection and pre-formatted reporting, not as a productivity tool. Its users report that it is unfriendly and inflexible. It is a menu-driven system, and is not intuitive like newer technologies today, which present a graphical user interface (GUI). GUI products are accepted as being easier to use, giving the user more control over the patterns of access to data and requiring much less training.</P>

<P>The data in CIMSIII is inaccessible except to personnel trained in the use of reporting tools that are proprietary to the AS/400. Even when personnel are trained to access the data, the skills are not transferable to the desktop productivity tools used in the District for other purposes. Data from other systems cannot be integrated easily with CIMS data, although CIMS can format files for other systems. For example, the District downloads student data from CIMS to the SNAP Cafeteria Management System (PC based), but in order to produce the state required Accountability Data System reports (ADS), SNAP’s data on free and reduced lunch eligibility must be manually entered into CIMS from a report produced by SNAP. Similar difficulties exist with Transportation data. While its data resides on the same platform as CIMS (AS/400), the current data integration strategy is to key transportation data in CIMS from a report produced by the Transportation Department.</P>

<P>Capturing new data requires the expertise of specially trained staff. While the TRC has the expertise, insufficient trained resources limit the District’s ability to respond quickly to data needs. As an example of the impact, it was reported that the lack of data on services for special education students needed for submission of Medicaid claims possibly resulted in the loss of funds. In addition, federal impact aide dollars could be increased substantially if appropriate data were collected about each student.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558608"><B>CIMSII Does not Support the Way Schools Work</A></LI>
</B><P>CIMSIII does not support the way schools work. It is limited mainly to authorized office personnel because its data is not organized to allow access in a secure manner to all who need access. Security is implemented at the module level, not at the screen or field level. Since each module contains so much data, individuals with a limited &quot;need to know&quot; are excluded.</P>

<P>In addition, the system doesn’t contain many of the tools and data that teachers and administrators need to perform everyday operations as well as to plan and track student progress. In response, schools are adopting software that fills the gaps but does not integrate with CIMS. In some schools, teachers are using gradebook software (Grade Machine by Misty City Software) to store student attendance and daily assignments, finding it very useful for calculating class grades and parent conferences. The high schools are implementing InfoTracker, a tool to plan and track a student’s educational and career objectives. Teachers have expressed a desire to see student test scores and to be able to identify easily the exceptional classification of incoming students. Software products to meet these needs are being acquired; however, their impact on productivity and student learning is being compromised as redundant data is being captured in diverse and unrelated systems. </P>

<P>Reported data and data handling difficulties include: maintenance of two sets of course numbers, requiring the conversion of the state standardized 8-digit course code required for ADS to local numbers for student transcripts; student names remaining on attendance sheets all year even after the student has withdrawn; and transportation eligibility collected based on parent determination at registration rather than via the transportation system.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558609"><B>CIMSIII Does not Support the Way the District’s Business Offices Work</A></LI>
</B><P>CIMSIII does not support the way the District’s business offices work. An outside evaluation is that the District grew too fast and the systems did not keep up.</P>

<P>CIMS either lacks or has never been configured to utilize numerous controls needed to ensure data integrity. Reported, although unsubstantiated, deficiencies include a Trial Balance that does not take encumbrances into consideration; a Human Resource module that does not roll into Budget; salaries not being encumbered (<I>note that the District is changing CIMS to automatically set a flag to encumber on hire);</I> no budget reports by program/program area that compare actual to budget; overspending the budget is allowed <I>(note that the switch that prevents overspending has never been turned on as a control); </I>encumbrances generated at the time the PO is cut, not at requisition; and payroll not validated against the salary schedule keyed in by Human Resource.</P>
<I>
</I><P>As reported, some CIMS capabilities have never been used fully and CIMS does not  support some needs very well. Position control has never been used; therefore, the District cannot use it to determine the number of teacher vacancies. <I>(Note that the systems analyst learning this portion of the system was hospitalized.) </I>In addition, budget development capabilities are underutilized, limiting the tie of FTEs to the budget for payroll, and limiting the capture of historical budget data.</P>

<P>Finally, CIMSIII is an accrual-based system. Therefore, in order to report on a cash basis as is required by the state, the District must hold things out. <I>(Note that the State is considering allowing Districts that are ready to move to accrual accounting.)</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558610"></I><B>CIMSIII Technology Reinforces an Outdated Computing Paradigm</A></LI>
</B><P>CIMSIII technology reinforces the outdated computing paradigm in which data ownership and management are the responsibility of large information processing organizations staffed with personnel resources to accommodate information users. As a result, neither the District offices nor schools have control over their data and their ability to manipulate and use it is restricted. They receive only the data that has been pre-formatted in the software’s reports, unless TRC resources are available to customize the data view desired.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558611"><B>Housing of Accountability Data in Student Information Systems</A></LI>
</B><P>The State Department of Education is recommending that districts begin to house accountability data in their student information systems in anticipation of a probable requirement to include it in the Accountability Data System file transfer. Attendance data is expected in the ADS for the upcoming school year. Both of these requirements necessitate a programming effort for which resources must be identified.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558612"><B>Budget Data Collection</A></LI>
</B><P>The State Department of Education anticipates that within two years, the budget information currently being submitted manually will be collected electronically. Any analysis of CIMSIII and the District’s capacity to comply with upcoming data requirements must incorporate this expectation.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558613"><B>Performance-Based Budgeting</A></LI>
</B><P>Performance-based budgeting is expected by one-third of the state’s school districts by July 1, 2000, including all districts with schools designated as &quot;low-performing&quot; by the State. Santa Fe has four of these schools. The State Department is looking into software for statewide adoption to perform this function. The probable candidate, which operates on an NT platform, not on the AS/400, will require the District to load ADS data and budget data for the purpose of analyzing return on investment.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558614"><B>Standardizing District Financial Packages</A></LI>
</B><P>The Statewide Accounting Task Force is looking into standardizing district financial packages, a move which certainly will have an impact on the District’s reliance on the CIMSIII software.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558615"><B>Replacement of CIMSIII Software by Developer</A></LI></OL>

</B><P>National Computer Systems, the developer of the CIMSIII software, has indicated possible plans to develop a client server based CIMS, running on a Unix platform, by December 2000 to replace the current software. The District has been approached in the past about replacing the CIMSIII student information component with a PC-based product - SASIxp - which was purchased by NCS and publicized as a strategic offering. Although no plans have been announced for dropping support for the current CIMS product, the District’s planning process must include recognition of these developments. </P>

</B><P>There is no defined role to oversee data integrity and to provide data access to all of the District’s and schools’ knowledge workers.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558618"><B>Ownership of Electronic Data</A></LI>
</B><P>Ownership of electronic data by its originators is limited. The District tightly controls school level participation in data collection and validation as a strategy to improve data quality. While the strategy has been successful, the impact is a limited reliance in everyday activities on the data and the systems that house it. An additional impact is the increased reliance on the TRC staff to maintain data that originates at the school, increasing the workload of TRC staff and creating a data source that does not contain current information for school users.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558619"><B>Numerous Data Collection Processes</A></LI>
</B><P>Numerous district level data collection processes exist to capture school level data. In addition to the collection from CIMSIII to meet the state mandated reporting requirements of the Accountability Data System, individual offices collect data both manually and electronically. Due to the inflexibility of CIMSIII and to processes geared toward individual offices rather than the entire enterprise, the data is housed separately, unintentionally isolating it from shared usage. That data is never incorporated into the enterprise data store, limiting the District’s ability to make data available across departments and to the schools.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558620"><B>Reengineering District Processes around CIMSIII</A></LI>
</B><P>District program areas are reengineering processes around CIMSIII, not with it. Excel spreadsheets proliferate, each with valuable enterprise data, some with duplicate and not always consistent data. Some of this individually initiated process reengineering results from lack of knowledge of what the system can do. This lack of knowledge, coupled with the system inadequacies, is contributing to underutilization of system capabilities, unnecessary work, data fragmentation, and duplication of data and effort.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558621"><B>Enterprise Data Standards</A></LI>
</B><P>The lack of enterprise data standards, along with the fragmented data stores, is allowing data collected in the enterprise system (CIMSIII) to be referenced differently from the same data kept in separate systems, including data as critical as school numbers. Merging these data for analytical purposes cannot be accomplished without considerable manual manipulation. </P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558622"><B>Data Loss</A></LI>
</B><P>Numerous instances of data loss have been reported, including historical budgets and Average Daily Membership (ADM). With the TRC procedures in place to back up and archive enterprise data, one of the District’s most valuable resources is being protected. However, data collected outside of TRC control is subject to the procedures initiated by the individual collectors and therefore subject to loss.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558623"><B>Accountability Structures</A></LI></OL>

</B><P>Accountability structures are developing at the District that have the potential for identifying weaknesses and assisting in the determination of corrective and progressive actions. Currently their capacity to impact change is limited. The data is time-consuming to collect. The presentation is manual. The focus is static. However, within this initiative is an opportunity for the District to set the stage for creating a new level of information – the information needed by the SFPS to evaluate itself and its programs both real-time and longitudinally. A careful analysis of the processes being performed by the District along with the data needed to support them can improve the underlying data that support everyday operations, reveal strategies to incorporate appropriate data into enterprise data stores, and begin to define a rich source of comparative data designed to assist in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Santa Fe Public Schools.</P>

</B></I><P>The unanimous opinion among those interviewed is that the District’s management of technology has noticeably improved under the guidance of the current Executive Director, employed since November 1998.</P>

<P>While the complaints about lack of money, lack of time, staff development, teacher morale, and unclear procedures are pervasive, both school and District personnel express confidence in the direction being formulated, even though they are not entirely sure what it is. An opportunity exists for the District to capitalize on this positive momentum. Developing a clear, long-range vision for technology in the District and delineating the objectives, needs, assigned responsibilities, and benchmarks that can herald success will enable the schools and the office to discover what they hope the technology will yield, and to identify what resources will be required to achieve their goal. </P>

<P>The TRC is viewed as being very responsive to the calls for help, whether they are for technology purchases, computer maintenance, or software operation. However, a common sentiment throughout the District is that there are not enough people to handle the load. Also, frustration is expressed over the lack of information about when requests will be fulfilled.</P>

<P>The Computer Site Representatives (CSR) are viewed as essential to a school’s success with technology innovations and upkeep, although numerous concerns were expressed about the role. Generally it is felt that a teacher meeting the ever increasing demands of the CSR role will compromise either teaching responsibilities or support responsibilities. When technology is not responding, assistance is needed quickly to ensure that the classroom experience utilizing it is not comprimised. Yet for a teacher to respond, his/her classroom experience is compromised. School administrative offices are becoming more dependent on technology in the performance of their jobs. Isolating their support time to a teacher’s free period during the day does not reflect the needs of the office. In addition, the CSR job requires two different types of effort: Keeping the computers and networks running requires training in specific skills, while instructing teachers in incorporating technology into the curriculum is a more conceptual endeavor. <I>(As an aside, the changing of the payment schedule to year-end seems to be affecting morale and acting as a disincentive.)</P>
</I>
<P>The Technology Learning Center is viewed as serving a very important role. Yet it is already recognized that it cannot begin to serve the needs of a district that is moving rapidly into integrating technology into the entire school experience. There isn’t time for teachers to participate in training outside of their schools. The hardware on which they are trained is inevitably not the hardware they use daily. Many times the participant does not have ready access in the school to the software being demonstrated.</P>
<P>Teachers feel that training must be treated as staff development – with long-range plans laid out and personnel trained to support them locally in their technology integration efforts. Also, they feel that the District can provide an additional service by acting as a clearinghouse for training opportunities throughout the state as well as providing the mechanisms to track participation.</P>

<P>Resistance to technology out of a fear of the unknown is cited as one of the main reasons that the District and schools are not  using technology currently as effectively as they could. The use of technology in support of everyday processes is viewed as one the best tools to overcome the natural resistance of inexperienced teachers and administrators. A few of the suggestions volunteered include: district personnel using email to communicate with school personnel, principals distributing important information to staff by email, and on-line procedure manuals on the District web site. <A NAME="_Toc466792014"><A NAME="_Toc466793473"></P>

</B></FONT><P>As technology becomes more prevalent in schools across the country, expectations for corresponding improvements in education grow as well. Technology is not a panacea for the challenges facing the education community today. However, when used appropriately, it can be a tool to promote practices shown to improve student achievement and school performance.<SUP>1 (See Appendix 11.16 for references)</P>
</SUP>
<P>For schools to accomplish the transformations demanded by 21st century global competition, the application of technology should cut across all school operations. Its impact on education administrative and student service functions ultimately translates into opportunities for increased student learning. </P>

<P>A few examples demonstrate the magnitude of potential time saved from adopting and using wisely even the most basic technology. A junior high school in Richardson, Texas installed telephones in classrooms so teachers could reduce time walking through hallways to communicate. This simple change resulted in approximately 15.5 more days of instructional time each year.<SUP>3 </SUP>At River Oaks school outside of Toronto, Ontario, the principal adopted a practice of conducting all logistical communications with his staff via email, thus eliminating the need for administrative discussions in staff meetings. Consequently, biweekly meetings of 90-100 minutes were reduced to three staff meetings per year. This simple approach saved more than three hours in teacher and staff time per month.<SUP>1</SUP> While the value of such time reductions must be examined in the context of how well the time gained is utilized, the opportunities afforded by the additional time may not have surfaced otherwise.</P>

<P>This report focuses solely on the use of technology in the management and business operations of the Santa Fe School District. However, its perspective is broader than the District office itself. The technology used by and provided by the District office has an immediate impact on the operations of its schools. Therefore, those technologies supporting school administration and instruction management are included.</P>

<P>Many of the recommendations offered are applicable to the use of technology in instruction as well. However, the District’s Education Plan for Student Success (EPSS) should determine the extent to which these recommendations will be used to support the definition of curriculum content standards for technology and the movement away from traditional learning models in favor of integrating technology into instruction. </P>

<P>&quot;The quality of public education in this country increasingly depends upon our collective ability to close the gap between technology presence and its effective use in the pursuit of school improvement.&quot; <SUP>1 </SUP>Focusing on the presence and use of technology in the Santa Fe School District, the following recommendations are offered with the goal of maximizing the efficiency of District operations through effective technologies by building on the direction already started, providing a longer-term focus, and instituting a greater fiscal and educational accountability.</P>


<UL>
<LI>Establish a Technology Advisory Council</LI>
<LI>Develop a strategic plan for the use and implementation of technology</LI>
<LI>Upgrade business systems application software</LI>
<LI>Provide integrated productivity tools that enable schools to accept responsibility for data management</LI>
<LI>Develop an education Data Warehouse</LI>
<LI>Develop a gateway to education data and information</LI>
<LI>Consolidate data centers utilizing a common system configuration</LI>
<LI>Consolidate the management of data collection and reporting</LI>
<LI>Develop an infrastructure support approach that reflects the continual increase in technology usage</LI></UL>


<P>The full scope of these recommendations would require a tremendous commitment in time and money for the District. Therefore, they should be considered as goals to be attained, each with an incremental implementation leading to its full benefits. In addition, most of these goals are not unique to the Santa Fe School District. This allows for the exploration of regionalized solutions – solutions shared with other school districts. Regardless of the approach taken to achieve them, each goal should be examined carefully in light of the evolving technology direction of the New Mexico State Department of Education. The State may provide alternative approaches for accomplishing these goals. Santa Fe does not need to duplicate the efforts of others if its vision can be met through them.</P>

<FONT FACE="Tms Rmn"><P>Each of the following recommendations includes an implementation strategy/timeline and an estimate of fiscal impact. Since some of the recommendations are interdependent, suggestions for sequencing are detailed in Appendix 11-18.</P>

</B></I><P>Creating a Technology Advisory Council, in response to the general perception that District technology decisions are made independently, provides a publicly recognized forum for input on technology direction. Staffed to include representatives of all appropriate stakeholders, the council will capitalize on the expertise and talents that are needed to formulate a community vision for the use of technology as well as to identify and continually assess curriculum-based 21st century workplace skills. Also, the sharing of relevant best practices can help speed technology integration into the curriculum as well as generate ideas for overcoming resistance to the use of technology.</P>

<P>Technology available outside school walls is often several generations ahead of the technology available inside school walls.<SUP>2</SUP> However, the community is not usually aware of this difference. The collaboration of local businesses and organizations, corporations, schools of education, community colleges, K12 teachers and administrators, parents, and non-parent community members provides a framework to increase public awareness and secure support for the technology initiatives needed to bridge the gap.</P>

<P>Taking direction from New Mexico’s Council on Technology in Education, the Santa Fe Technology Advisory Council would establish, coordinate, and clearly define the responsibilities of workgroups charged with technology planning and assessment, curriculum integration and professional development, legislative recommendations, and communication and public awareness. Reporting directly to Santa Fe’s Superintendent of Schools, the Advisory Council could represent the educational technology needs and views of both administration and instruction. </P>

<P>The Superintendent should implement this recommendation immediately. There are no financial implications for this recommendation in that no additional resources are required.</P>

</B></I><P>The best method for achieving results is to develop a long-range plan with pre-defined, widely endorsed goals and objectives--ambitious but attainable, as well as an action plan, necessary resources, and a process to evaluate success. Such a plan provides a roadmap to a future that realizes the benefits of utilizing technology effectively in management, assessment, communications, and instruction.</P>

<P>A technology plan by itself is not enough. To be successful, it must reflect the policy and educational environment of the District. Therefore it is important that the plan for technology be incorporated into the District’s larger planning effort - the Education Plan for Student Success (EPSS), enabling technology goals to be woven into overall District goals for school improvement. As the District’s comprehensive long-range planning, implementation, and evaluation tool, it will ensure that technology receives a priority level appropriate to its potential for impact.</P>

<P>Also, to be successful, the plan must be a dynamic tool that presents opportunities for dialogue and professional development. It must encourage local decision making and innovation. Therefore, the processes of technology plan development, implementation, and evaluation are essential components. </P>

<P>Simply introducing computers, software, and the Internet into offices and classrooms will not necessarily increase the effectiveness of education or education management in Santa Fe. Real, sustained improvement will take time, commitment, money and vision - reflected in a dynamic plan that brings focus to the needs, directs activities, and efficiently manages the expenditures of limited resources.</P>

<P>Creating such a plan begins with an evaluation of the current plan. Upon affirmation and/or rejection of its direction by the Technology Advisory Council, the following activities are performed.</P>
<OL>

<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558629"><B>Develop a Vision for the Use of Technology</A></LI>
</B><P>A vision of how technology will impact education processes provides the focus that can ensure that technology implementation is not sidetracked. Knowing where the District wants to be in the next 3-5 years is the first step.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558630"><B>Define and Assess the District’s Technology Needs</A></LI>
</B><P>Identifying the gap between the District’s technology vision and its present situation is the next step. Closing this gap then becomes the focus of technology planning. An inventory of the technology currently in place and how it is being used provides a baseline for the plan as well as for ultimately assessing the plan’s impact. This activity involves not only a physical count of hardware and connectivity, but also a study of the school and District processes being performed and their associated data needs, along with a recognition of upcoming state and federal requirements for data capture and reporting.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558631"><B>Identify Opportunities for Reengineering to Improve Efficiency and Effectiveness</A></LI>
</B><P>Empowered with a vision, a knowledge of key business requirements, upcoming external expectations, and an understanding of current needs, resource planning for the enterprise identifies changes and improvements that can lead to increased efficiency and effectiveness. Research into cross-functional software solutions for the District and schools determines the degree to which off-the-shelf business and instructional management software can assist. It also identifies potential process and organizational changes needed to successfully utilize the software. In addition, a study of other state and district choices for technology solutions and the architecture to support them, along with general &quot;best practices&quot; research, provides a rich source of ideas from which the plan’s framework can develop.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558632"><B>Determine Strategy and Develop a Prioritized Sequence of Long-Range Activities</A></LI>
</B><P>Led by the Technology Advisory Council, the District’s technology direction is set. Ultimately a long-range, prioritized sequence of activities is defined to form a technology plan unique to the District.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558633"><B>Develop a Conceptual Design for Technical Architecture</A></LI>
</B><P>Based on an understanding of the District’s need for data accessibility and the manageability of its technology environment, a conceptual design is developed for the technical architecture desired. Incorporating the needs of all District departments and schools, this design will provide direction to the decisions that must be made about computer applications, hardware purchases, and district-wide technology standards.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558634"><B>Evaluate Human and Financial Resource Requirements</A></LI>
</B><P>A clear spending plan directed toward reaching specific goals is essential. This requires an evaluation of the level of personnel expertise needed to implement the plan successfully, in addition to the planned expenditures for hardware, software, and connectivity. The cost of human and physical resources forms the initial budget projection.</P>
<I><LI><A NAME="_Toc474558635"></I><B>Develop a Strategy to Assess and Publicize Progress</A></LI>
</B><P>Securing a positive return on rising investments in technology resources requires a heightened focus on how these resources are used. Unfortunately, it is difficult to measure &quot;use&quot; of resources in public schools. Software designed to account for program and process costs provides accountability for the flow of funds. Assessing the impact of the flow of funds requires additional strategies however. Benchmarks designed to measure progress provide a visible means of assessment. Whether adopted from a nationally recognized model for assessment, or designed as a unique model, Santa Fe’s model can be used as a tool for publicizing its successes and therefore make the case for fully funding and implementing its technology plan. The model can also serve to validate the directions chosen as well as to support modifications when the assessment reveals weaknesses in the current approach.</P>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558636"><B>Develop a Strategy for Long-Term Funding</A></LI></OL>

</B><P>As the relevance of technology in process improvement becomes even more accepted, the funding of initial investments becomes easier. However, as technology becomes more integrated into education, the challenges of obsolescence and maintenance are substantial. Ongoing and sustainable sources of revenue are required to ensure that the investments of today don’t become the burdens of tomorrow. Santa Fe’s technology plan must reflect the continual upgrading of its infrastructure – both human and technical – and provide for those future costs through alternative procurement practices and funding allocations that can sustain ongoing costs.</P>

<P>The Superintendent should begin the development of a strategic plan for technology immediately. A District-wide plan for the use and implementation of technology will require two to three months. Internal resources can develop the plan. If outside services are procured, it will cost approximately $200,000.</P>

</B></I><P>While the analysis performed as part of the strategic planning process will identify additional reengineering opportunities, preliminary analysis performed as a part of this study of the District’s management and business operations reveals the need for upgrading/replacing the current CIMSIII application software. Based on findings to date, the system that provides support for most of Santa Fe’s business operations (including student data management) does not provide the level of support currently needed by the District and will not be able to keep pace with its growing expectations. </P>

<P>The replacement of this software could have a significant impact on the current technical infrastructure of the District. A preliminary examination of available software replacements reveals that the current infrastructure may place considerable constraints on the selection. However, a decision to replace the limiting components of the architecture in order to implement a more powerful business software tool raises issues about storage of, and access to, data being maintained in the existing system. Any decision about changes in the technical architecture must be made in the context of the full perspective of the role of technology in the Santa Fe School District, as evidenced in the District’s strategic plan.</P>

<P>The Superintendent should complete the analysis of the shortcomings of the current system and begin an examination of possible replacement products and upgrade strategies immediately. This analysis should run concurrently with the strategic planning process. While the planning process identifies the business requirements, the product search uncovers the alternative architectures that can form the basis of a common infrastructure to support the District’s information technology resources. Ideally, the Activity Based Costing (ABC) model, recommended in the Financial Development and Practices section of this report, would have progressed far enough to provide information to the strategic planning process and product replacement search that identifies clearly the processes that need to be supported. </P>

<P>While the complete replacement of the current software is recommended as the best long-term solution, overcoming the current business application shortcomings can be addressed in numerous ways. Therefore, the initial step in the upgrade process should confirm the District’s direction through an examination of the options - local vs. regionalized software purchase, incremental by module vs. total implementation, student information system replacement only, state-mandated financial application vs. locally chosen, interim end-user reporting flexibility through the Data Warehouse, migration to the next generation CIMS when available, etc. Each option’s impact on the District’s infrastructure must be then factored into the design for the District’s technical architecture in the strategic planning process.</P>

<P>The amount of time required to replace/upgrade the District’s business applications (including student information management) will vary greatly depending on the approach taken. An estimate is from 18 months (student system only) to three years (complete business system).</P>

<P>The cost will vary also depending on the approach taken and the robustness of the products’ features. Tier 1 Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) products (Finance, Human Resources, Employee Management, Fixed Assets, Warehouse Management, etc.) are very robust and powerful. However, the District may determine that a Tier 2 product might be more appropriate and affordable. Preliminary replacement costs for the student information management system alone range from $300,000 to $500,000. A complete Tier 1 ERP product, excluding student information, could range from $1.5 to $2.5 million.</P>

</B></I><P>Recognition of the value of data in education accountability continues to increase. Unless the District returns the responsibility for school data management to the schools, it will experience a corresponding increase in the resources required to collect and validate it. In addition, its schools will be deprived of the benefits student data can provide.</P>

<P>While high schools and some middle schools are taking advantage of the current management software to ease the burden of extremely time-consuming tasks such as class scheduling, most of the existing capabilities are underutilized. Due to limitations in the software, as well as necessary management decisions on the part of the District, schools have not received the benefits of basic student data processing tools. Therefore, schools have little incentive to ensure their data is complete and accurate. The data they enter is useful generally only to the District for state reporting purposes.</P>

<P>The District needs to tap into the potential of management software to provide needed assistance to its schools in daily operations, and subsequently contribute to data integrity. Self-validation occurs when the data being entered serves a purpose to those entering it. Replacing the functionality of the current student information management system (SIS) will provide schools the catalyst for accepting ownership of their data. However, true self-validation will occur only when management tools extend beyond the walls of the school’s administrative office to those who need it to make informed decisions about individual student’s education.</P>

<P>Teacher desktop tools can enable more effective classroom administration and instruction preparation – providing capabilities for analyzing students’ progress, recording and averaging class grades, entering attendance, mapping out and monitoring individual education/career plans, accessing and utilizing District/State curriculum. Data integrity issues reduce dramatically when those entering the data become dependent on its accuracy.</P>

<P>Some of the Santa Fe schools have begun to introduce these capabilities to their teachers and student service personnel; however they are operating outside of the District’s student information management system. Adopting an integrated approach to incorporating these tools into the District’s student information management system will eliminate the redundancy of effort that individual schools will experience as they attempt these productivity tools on their own. At the same time, the responsibility of data management will be returned to the schools in such a way that the data is self-validating, eliminating the need to provide central resources to manage the integrity of school data.</P>

<P>The Superintendent should implement this recommendation after the strategic plan is completed and the choice of student information system is made. The plan will identify the capabilities that schools desire and a decision on the direction of the SIS will determine whether existing products can be integrated or whether replacement products are needed. Also, many student information management systems include teacher tools as an integral part of their offering.  Therefore, timelines and costs for this recommendation will vary greatly depending on the direction taken to replace/upgrade the student information management system.</P>

</B></I><P>The data stored in traditional business systems applications is optimized to meet the needs of daily transaction processing and reporting. With the increased emphasis on accountability based on longitudinal indicators and comparative success factors, traditional data stores are difficult to analyze and use. A Data Warehouse provides storage for data that has been optimized to answer the kinds of questions that lead to the identification of weaknesses and assist in the determination of corrective actions.</P>

<P>Data currently being collected from Santa Fe schools is being compiled into individual school reports which include the State’s indicators for determining high/low performing schools: student achievement, attendance, drop-out rates, parent and community involvement, and school safety. These data are being used with schools to examine options for improvement. While the value of this data to effect school improvement is not in question, the mechanisms available to make the best use of them are.</P>

<P>A snapshot of performance or lack thereof is revealing in itself. However, progress can be determined only through an examination of multiple years or instances of data. A Data Warehouse captures and presents information in a format that reveals trends and enables comparisons of a school with itself and similar schools. With a variety of tools for varying levels of technology expertise, data can be interpreted to meet very specific, new and creative requests and presented in a format customized to the needs of the requestor.</P>

<P>Data captured from numerous operational systems becomes a repository of enterprise data from which all knowledge workers can retrieve consistent current and trend data – data that has been validated and prepared for publication. Its trending/comparative capabilities can be used, for example, to analyze program funding and effectiveness in order to drive policy decisions related to access and equity, as well as to adjust resource allocations to achieve equity. Both individual student achievement data and school-based data can provide current status and progress indicators according to the District’s unique definition or standardized statewide definitions.</P>

<P>Managed and protected by the District’s technology department, the Data Warehouse captures the history currently being lost in individually engineered staff systems and releases the history stored in difficult to access operational systems. Its use is independent of the software tools that create it, making it available to a variety of data access and reporting tools, many of which are very user-friendly and require little formal training. With the integration of an enterprise Data Warehouse into its business information systems, the District takes control of its data and turns it into information that has the potential for improving education in Santa Fe.</P>

<P>The Superintendent can begin to implement this recommendation immediately after the strategic plan is completed. However, the total design of the Warehouse cannot be completed until the business systems replacement/upgrade is determined. While the process to identify the information for inclusion in the Warehouse is independent of the systems that produce it, the tools for capturing the data from source systems vary according to the platform of the systems. The completion of the Warehouse should coincide with the completion of the portion(s) of the business systems replacement/upgrade from which the Warehouse will obtain its data. If the District were to decide not to replace the business systems in the near future, the Data Warehouse could be implemented with the current system and migrated when appropriate. </P>

<P>Since a Data Warehouse is a continually evolving system, its implementation timeline should be expressed in increments. The initial phase to create a functioning environment and to define and load a meaningful set of data can be completed in approximately 9-12 months for an estimated cost of $400,000 to $500,000. SFPS resources will be required to maintain and enhance the Warehouse. Assuming that the replacement of the student information management system allows the schools to enter and maintain their own data, some of the TRC resources currently devoted to student data could be diverted to the Warehouse.</P>

</B></I><P>Santa Fe’s web site provides the beginnings of a gateway to information that could be used in education as well as report on education. If adopted by the District as its focal point for information, the site would become a powerful tool. Utilizing the existing capabilities of the Internet for public information and creating limited access capabilities for SFPS personnel through a District Intranet, a gateway to data and information can be provided that serves the needs of both the community and the school system.</P>

<P>Used as a public information tool, the site would provide an avenue to archive local communications for reference by the community on demand. Its current calendar could be expanded to include individual school items as well as individual teacher items. Packaged to direct parents to individual school communications, the site’s information could be readily available, eliminating the struggle by parents to find pertinent items. Instructions useful to parents could be expanded to answer frequently asked questions, such as school registration procedures. It could also be used as a survey instrument to collect information about the community’s satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the District and to solicit ideas for improvement.</P>

<P>Obviously, parent access is currently a limiting factor. While initially the site could not replace the traditional ways of information exchange, it could augment them by providing information retrieval after the papers sent home have been thrown away.</P>

<P>Used as a public relations tool, the site could herald the successes and accomplishments of the Santa Fe schools. Additionally, the status of technology and the progress being made could be tracked according to the benchmarks specified in the strategic plan, along with a continually updated fiscal review of needs and targeted revenue.</P>

<P>Used as an administrative tool, the site could eliminate a great deal of paperwork. As an example, the beginning of year registration process could be streamlined by allowing parents to verify on-line the information about their child contained in the student information management system. Entering only the information that had changed – and entering it for all children only once – would dramatically reduce the amount of time parents spend in the process and could reduce the inevitable and loud complaints from parents when asked to repeat the current process yearly. Integrating this changed information into the current student database presents a short-term challenge. However, if the system is replaced, additional opportunities for streamlining data capture could be explored.</P>

<P>Used as a teacher/administrator toolbox, the site would provide a primary access point to both administrative and instructional materials. The District could respond to the complaint that the procedures for performing administrative tasks are unknown by committing to on-line documentation and communication. Information about certification requirements, purchase order and contracting procedures, payroll/personnel notifications, etc. could be located easily as well as kept up-to-date. Also, as a precursor or companion to introducing instructional management tools in the classrooms, curriculum guides and teaching materials could be published, thereby ensuring that all teachers are provided the same level of access to the District’s and State’s curriculum expectations.</P>

<P>The concept of a web-based teacher toolbox has developed so considerably in Washington State’s Kent School District that its use is taught to all teachers as a part of the District’s 40-hour technology training program. Among other things, the web site allows teachers to complete otherwise cumbersome paperwork on-line, find information on their students, share lesson plans, and sign up for professional development activities. The web site has given teachers who might not otherwise use technology a reason to do so. By using the toolbox, they become more comfortable with using technology - the first step in preparing to integrate technology into the classroom. An added bonus is that the toolbox saves teachers’ time. The District has calculated that simply allowing elementary school teachers to order student lunch on-line saves each teacher 30 minutes daily, and the District $130,000 weekly. <SUP>1</P>
</SUP>
<P>Used an as internal communication tool, the site could present <I>secured</I> information to District personnel such as quarterly performance reviews, budget status reports, projected expenditures, personnel statistics, etc. Expanding on the concept utilized with the current electronic Board policies, the site could make available position descriptions to eliminate the concerns that job responsibilities are not clear. Procedures for performing internal operations could be documented and readily available. Also as a tool to foster accountability, benchmarks and critical success factors could be monitored.</P>

<P>Santa Fe’s gateway to information also can make the data contained in its Data Warehouse available to district personnel as well as the community through a common means of access. School profiles can be displayed, breaking information down to levels that answer commonly asked questions. Ad hoc queries could be performed against data currently locked in operational databases. The possibilities are almost limitless. However, to prevent duplications and public perceptions of inconsistency, decisions about data to be published should be made recognizing that the State Department of Education will be embarking on a Data Warehousing project of its own that will make data about the District more publicly available.</P>

<P>In practical terms, the District has the opportunity to connect staff, teachers, and the community to a vast knowledge base as well as to streamline its operations – all with a District-wide commitment to utilizing a common access point that can be provided through the creative and focused use of web technology. </P>

<P>The Superintendent should implement this recommendation after the completion of the strategic plan and the direction for the business systems is set. Its implementation can coincide with the business systems and Data Warehouse implementation; however, the timing will depend on the design of the Gateway and the scope and timing of the other initiatives. An estimate for the initial phase of a continually evolving system is approximately $300,000 for about six months. Enhancing the system and keeping it current will require SFPS resources beyond the student web team currently in place. Assuming the replacement of the student information management system allows the schools to enter and maintain their own data, some of the TRC resources devoted to student data could be diverted to the Gateway.</P>

</B></I><P>As is evident in Appendix 11.15, Preliminary Inventory of Core Hardware and Software, computer resources within the District are varied as well as found in various locations. The management of these resources varies as well. As the technology planning process identifies the infrastructure best suited to accommodate the District’s needs, the responsibility for the infrastructure’s management and a physical location consolidating its components needs to be addressed.</P>

<P>Physical consolidation will improve the TRC’s support capabilities and help ensure that standard practices are implemented to protect the investment in hardware, software, and data. In addition, a consolidated data center will enable the utilization of excess computer processing capacity, producing computing efficiencies that are difficult to obtain otherwise.</P>

<P>A common system configuration, even without physical consolidation, simplifies integration initiatives. This approach ensures that the core financial systems are compatible with systems that support the program areas and that their data can be shared with minimal intervention. A common configuration also enables various computer applications to be run interchangeably on any of the hardware, providing a quick recovery capability in response to a hardware failure. </P>

<P>Consolidating the management of data center resources will help define standard practices and ensure that they are enforced. Along with the responsibility for setting technology direction should come the responsibility for overseeing it.</P>

<P>The Superintendent should begin implementing this recommendation immediately and continue toward this goal as the common infrastructure is implemented. There are no known financial implications in that no additional resources are required beyond those needed to implement the infrastructure.</P>

</B></I><P>The District’s core business system is not readily adaptable to new data collections unless data is already defined in the system. As a result, some of the data collected by the District is never incorporated into it. Without a complete source of data to access additional data collections occur. Many times these collections replicate data already existing at the District due to a lack of knowledge about who has data and how to retrieve it.</P>

<P>Replacing the current system and building a Data Warehouse would eliminate many of these problems. However, the responsibility for managing the processes and ensuring that pertinent data become enterprise data needs to be designated.</P>

<P>The Superintendent should implement this recommendation immediately. There are no known financial implications for this recommendation in that no additional resources are required.</P>

</B></I><P>Effective technology usage requires the District to develop a plan for supporting both its human and technical infrastructure. While the current support structure recognizes both needs, it will be challenged significantly as the use of technology rapidly increases in the District office and schools of Santa Fe. The single technician for computer repair will not be sufficient. One teacher Computer Site Representative per school cannot provide both first-line hardware support and training in the use of technology and its integration into curriculum. The District’s training center cannot provide all needed training in technology tools as well as accept the entire responsibility for staff development in technology usage.</P>

<P>With the definition of the District’s technology vision and supporting technical architecture resulting from its strategic planning process, a redefinition of the support structure will be necessary. Without a strategic plan that defines the extent to which the District intends to utilize and support technology, recommendations woulc lack focus. Therefore, the following suggestions made by interviewees  to resolve current complaints and prepare for the future, are offered as insights into a solution that supports the District’s vision.</P>


<UL>
<LI>Increase expenditures to either further outsource or increase in-house hardware repair expertise.</LI>
<LI>Implement a Call Tracking System that records service requests, tracks priorities, and identifies when support can be expected. Use of the system can help manage customer expectations, manage workload, provide expert knowledge of problem resolutions, and track areas of constant problems that might require replacement instead of continual service.</LI>
<LI>Allocate a full-time, on-site teacher position that is responsible for hardware support and for training teachers to integrate technology into the curriculum.</LI>
<LI>Hire several trainers who circulate among schools training teachers and their classes simultaneously in the use of technology.</LI>
<LI>Give principals the responsibility for training teachers in the use of the school level management systems and productivity tools, and focusing not on the software itself but on how teachers may use the data to improve their understanding of individual students and to make better decisions about instruction.</LI>
<LI>Provide staff with non-negotiable reasons to use technology. Send all announcements via email. Require that student information and assessment data be entered and accessed on-line. Providing efficient tools will allow this to happen.</LI>
<LI>Identify technology skills expected for District and school positions and include these skills in hiring practices.</LI>
<LI>Identify a technology skills training plan and track staff completion of the classes.</LI>
<LI>Include evaluation of technology usage in staff and teacher performance assessments. </LI>
<LI>Task the District to act as a clearinghouse for training opportunities locally, statewide, and nationally.</LI>
<LI>Move away from one-shot training. Professional development with technology should focus on how to use computers, software, and other technology tools in the performance of job functions, not simply on mechanics.</LI>
<LI>Provide consultation, planning, and facilitation services to schools as they undertake professional development initiatives.</LI>
<LI>Align professional development to school improvement plans and education reform initiatives of the District.</LI>
<LI>Require the allocation of significant resources toward professional development as part of any grant or funding initiatives.</LI></UL>

<I>
</I><P>Although outside the scope of this report, additional suggestions from literature that relate specifically to providing training to teachers in the integration of technology into instruction are:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Identify exemplary technology-using teachers and place one in every school who serves as a mentor to other teachers. As incentive the teacher receives training paid for by the District.<SUP>4</LI>
</SUP><LI>Select master teachers to serve as technology mentors who are responsible for developing technology-infused projects for their classroom in which other teachers and their classes participate. Participating teachers then receive assistance from the mentor in developing their own classroom projects to be carried out with another teacher and class, etc.<SUP>1</LI>
</SUP><LI>Pay teachers at the substitute rate to attend professional development workshops during non-school days. Everybody wins. The District pays what it would have paid had a substitute taught while the teacher was receiving training. Teachers are trained and are paid for their professional development work. Students are not deprived of their regular teacher.<SUP>1</LI>
</SUP><LI>Set aside days during the summer for professional development and pay teachers who choose to attend the per diem beginning teacher rate.<SUP>1</LI>
</SUP><LI>Pay for teacher training if the teacher agrees to create a technology-infused project with a teacher who has not yet been trained.<SUP>1</LI></UL>

</SUP>
<P>In order to sustain the rapid introduction of technology into education, the Santa Fe School District must look beyond traditional methods of support. It must look beyond the District to the entire community. The community entered into a partnership with the District as it helped formulate the vision for how technology would impact education in Santa Fe. Inherent in that role is the responsibility to help achieve the vision. The role of the District then becomes one of preparing the community to accept its responsibility by seeking out community resources and partnerships to not only support the acquisition of technology, but also to provide support for its use.</P>

<P>Utilizing community resources and sharing resources among schools extend the capabilities of the District and the schools. Collaborating with state and local organizations as well as community colleges and universities to provide staff development reduces the need for the District to fund a complete program. Forging relationships with local businesses or retired technical talent to provide hardware maintenance according to District standards might stretch the District’s limited maintenance budget. A system project such as the District’s current library automation project, although requiring an initial investment in funds, provides the potential for sharing library materials rather than duplicating them. At the same time, it is reducing the amount of support expected from the District by eliminating two computer systems and standardizing on one.</P>

<P>The energy generated by the explosive growth of technology occurring today can speed the transition of the Santa Fe School District into a high performance enterprise. However, using this energy to recondition current practices will not produce the desired results. Achievement will be constrained under the old roles, rules, and relationships. An important source of potential for solving educational problems lies in a shift in focus to community-built solutions – collaborative solutions that share human and other resources – in support of public education being reclaimed as a public institution.</P>

</B></FONT><P>The October 1999 (revised) Santa Fe Public School Board Policies and Administrative Regulations manual contains 62 separate policy statements that address <I>Personnel </I>issues, such as &quot;Absences and Leaves,&quot; &quot;Drug-Free Workplace,&quot; &quot;Grievances by Employees,&quot; &quot;Paternity Leave,&quot; &quot;Sexual Harassment,&quot; and &quot;Tutoring of Students.&quot; Policies definition is the responsibility of the elected Board of Education while the responsibility of staff is to promulgate administrative regulations that implement and comply with Board-adopted policies. This same District publication contains only two administrative regulations, which describe how the Board’s policies are to be implemented. These two administrative regulations are:</P>


<UL>
<LI>AR 4105 – Background Checks</LI>
<LI>AR 4103 – Personnel Access to Networked Information Resources</LI></UL>


<P>On February 18, 1997 Administrative Regulation AR 1000 was adopted in compliance with Board Policy BP 1000. BP 1000 states that:</P>

<OL>

<LI>The Board considers policy development one of its chief functions. It is the intent of the Board to develop policies and put them in writing so that they may serve as guidelines and goals for the successful and efficient functioning of the public schools.</LI></OL>

<OL>

<LI>It is through the development and adoption of written policies that the Board will exercise its leadership in the operation of the school system: it is through study and evaluation of the reports concerning the execution of its written policies that the Board will exercise its control over school operations.</LI>

<P>The corresponding Administrative Regulation (AR 1000) states that:</P>

<OL>

<OL>

<LI>The Administration considers the implementation of regulations and administrative procedure development as one of its chief functions.

<LI>It is through the development and adoption of directives and procedures that the Administration will exercise its leadership in the operation of the school system. Ongoing evaluation and input from staff is critical in the development of such directives and procedures.</LI>

<P>While AR 1000 affirms that &quot;It is the intent of the Administration to develop administrative procedures . . .

</B></I><P>The Human Resources Department of the Santa Fe Public Schools is comprised of an executive director, three staffing coordinators, and three administrative secretaries who function as staffing assistants.</P>

<P>The Executive Director is new to her position, having come to the department as the director of certified staffing in 1998. Two of the three staffing coordinators are new to their positions this year with the third, and only experienced, coordinator scheduled to retire on January 15, 2000. A data analyst position is vacant and is not scheduled to be filled this year. The &quot;administrative secretaries&quot; are responsible for substitute teacher staffing and deployment, preparing job advertisements, preparing information for the Board of Education, interviewing, and acting as intake persons for applicants and new employees.

</B></I><P>Recruitment of teachers was done primarily by the executive director and selected principals this past year. Plans for the future will include the staffing coordinators as part of this function. Budget was, and may continue to be, minimal, allowing the staff to recruit only within the state and at selected sites in neighboring states. A recruiting fair was established by the previous administration, setting up an opportunity for applicants to come to Santa Fe on a selected Saturday in May to meet with Human Resources personnel and be interviewed by principals. This appears to be working well, with some two hundred applicants reported as being involved in May 1999. SFPS does maintain a web site and has had some success in attracting candidates from regions where recruitment is not possible.</P>

</B></I><P>Utilization of a professional services firm with a deep human resource performance capability and a commitment to utilize experienced Human Resources public school personnel from New Mexico is recommended.</P>

<P>SFPS needs a cadre of professional Human Resources personnel who can design, implement, and manage personnel functions that &quot;. . . promote the efficient progress toward the basic goals of a school district – the education of students.&quot;</P>

<P>Input from a wide variety of SFPS employees, community representatives, and parent focus group participants expressed strong dissatisfaction with the District’s personnel practices, citing:</P>


<UL>
<LI>poor treatment by office personnel;</LI>
<LI>loss of personnel records;</LI>
<LI>non-responsive services; and </LI>
<LI>substantial time delays in fulfilling personnel requests.</LI></UL>


<P>SFPS could outsource its Personnel Practices to a privately operated human resources management firm. Two factors could lead the district to make this choice. First, as indicated, the personnel services operation of SFPS is not well managed. Through the better-managed operation of an independent management company, SFPS should achieve a better-planned and responsive personnel service operation. Second, the primary function of SFPS is to educate students. By outsourcing the personnel functions to an independent firm whose services can promote the efficient and effective recruitment, selection, and assignment of qualified certified and classified personnel the District can focus more on education.</P>

<P>The Santa Fe community has substantial resources that have the capability and expertise to provide the full range of personnel services required by a school district the size of SFPS. Additionally, a rich resource exists within New Mexico of recently retired public school personnel administrators who have extensive and successful experience managing and coordinating complex personnel operations for public school districts.</P>

<P>It is recommended that the outsourcing bid specifications include a requirement to incorporate experienced public school personnel as part of the staffing provided by the independent personnel management company.</P>

<P>It is further recommended that the District clearly specify the performance expectations in quantifiable and time-sensitive terms in the following functional areas:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Staffing</LI>
<LI>Recruitment</LI>
<LI>Processing</LI>
<LI>Selection</LI>
<LI>Background checks</LI>
<LI>Selection</LI>
<LI>Assignment</LI>
<LI>Performance appraisal</LI>
<LI>Employee discipline</LI>
<LI>Development of a comprehensive &quot;plan of action&quot;</LI>
<LI>Development of a personnel manual</LI>
<LI>Development of administrative regulations.</LI></UL>

</B></I><P>There is a need to realign the steps and columns to reflect a consistent percentage change both vertically and horizontally. Movement on the schedule is obviously inconsistent and skewed to the upper end of the schedule to benefit experienced teachers. Dollar amounts, rather than percentages, have caused a distortion of this salary schedule.</P>

<P>The certified teachers’ salary schedule ranges from a beginning salary for a teacher with a B.A. and no experience at $24,658 to a maximum salary of $45,575 for a teacher with an M.A. and 29 years of experience. The schedule consists of five columns with 14 steps under the B.A., 21 steps under the B.A.+15 and 30 steps under the B.A.+45 or M.A., M.A.+15, and M.A.+45 columns. Criteria for placement on the salary schedule are printed on the reverse side of the salary schedule.</P>

<P>The dollar amount and percentage change for vertical movement on the schedule (one year experience, no change in degree status, Attachment 3) ranges from $10 or .4% from step 0 to step 1, to $1,005 or 2.8% from step 20 to 21 in the M.A.+45 column. An anomaly exists in the B.A.+15 column, where movement from step 19 to step 20 results in an increase of $1257 or 3.8%.</P>

<P>Horizontal movement on the schedule (change in degree status, but no change in experience) ranges from $249 or 1% at the 0-step to $1,005 or 2.8% from the M.A.+15 to the M.A.+45 column at step 21.</P>

<P>Diagonal movement on the schedule (moving over one column and increasing experience by one year) ranges from $349 or 1.4% moving from the B.A.-0 column to the B.A.+15 column-1, to $2,010 or 5.5% moving from the M.A.-22 column to the M.A.+15-23 column.</P>

<P>The distribution of teachers through the various cells of the salary schedule (without regard to any supplemental pay for assignment in bilingual programs or extra duties beyond the regular school day) shows that:</P>
<FONT SIZE=1>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P>&#9;&#9;54% (464.53 teachers) earn between $24,658 to $29,887</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;27% (233.82 teachers) earn between $29,887 to $35,116</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;11% (96.35 teachers) earn between   $35,116 to $40,345</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;  8% (65.35 teachers) earn between   $40,345 to $45,575</P>
</FONT>
<P>This information was taken from the District’s October, 1999 Training and Experience Report submitted to the State Department of Education.</P>

<P>The average teacher salary actually paid for 1999-00 is estimated at $31,013 for purposes of the State Department of Education Training and Experience Report. This computation was reached by applying differential pay to the base salary. The additional salary is earned for work beyond the regular school day and for work in bilingual programs. It is assumed that the Classified Salary Schedule reflects a similar misalignment as a result of similar collective bargaining practices and, therefore, PwC recommends the restructuring of the classified salary schedule as well.</P>

</B></I><P>While Supervisors, Managers, Principals and Confidential Employees are excluded from the specifics of the following analysis, it is suggested that the salary schedules of these important District position classifications also be reviewed. These suggested salary reviews should be conducted to determine if and to what extent a realignment of respective compensation would be appropriate to reflect equity among all District employee classifications.</P>

<P>According to the State Department of Education’s &quot;Average Returning Teachers’ Salaries&quot; survey, the Santa Fe Public Schools are ranked 79<SUP>th</SUP> out of the 89 public school districts in the state. Only two districts gave increases less than Santa Fe’s $100 per employee for the 1999-00 school year – Belen and Rio Rancho gave no increase. The average increase for all districts in the state was $1,498 or 4.7%.</P>

<P>For purposes of comparison, three districts have been selected as being similar in size to Santa Fe Public Schools (Farmington, Gallup-McKinley County, and Gadsden); three are included as being in close proximity and, therefore, in competition for available employees (Albuquerque, Espanola, and Los Alamos).</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">*From State Department of Education Training and Experience Report</P>
</B>
<P>As indicated by the preceding comparisons, the Santa Fe Public Schools salary schedules are not where they need to be in order to attract candidates for employment. Only in the classification of instructional assistants is Santa Fe competitive.</P>

<P>The schedules would benefit from compression (fewer steps to reach maximum salary), but the basic problem is simply insufficient funds in all salary line items of the budget. Without an infusion of considerable dollars, Santa Fe will continue to lag behind the rest of the state.</P>

<P>Of particular concern is the teachers’ schedule. While Santa Fe is a wonderful city in which to live, the cost of living is second only to Los Alamos. Not only does Santa Fe’s salary fall well short of the state average, but Santa Fe is competing for teachers with other states where <I>starting</I> salaries commonly range from $30,000 to $32,000. A quick analysis shows that 95 Santa Fe teachers (11% of total number) will be eligible to retire at the end of this year with 25 or more years of service. More will be eligible under the rule of 75 (combined age and experience). Should these teachers opt for retirement and normal attrition for other reasons stay the same, Santa Fe could be facing a crisis. Quality teacher candidates are now able to pick and choose their jobs, and salary remains one of the prime factors in selecting a district in which to start a career.</P>

<P>It is recommended that across-the-board annual salary increases be granted. The following classifications were benchmarked. Other classifications should receive similar increases.</P>


<UL>
<LI>Teachers&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;$2,500/yr &#9;=&#9;  8.1%</LI>
<LI>Instructional Assistants&#9;&#9;&#9;$  0.21/hr&#9;=&#9;  2.6%</LI>
<LI>Custodians&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;$  0.43/hr&#9;=&#9;  6.0%</LI>
<LI>School Secretaries&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;$  1.35/hr&#9;=&#9;18.6%</LI>
<LI>Maintenance and Operations&#9;&#9;&#9;$  1.35/hr&#9;=&#9;17.5%</LI></UL>


<P>It is estimated that these recommended increases would cost slightly less than $3 million per annum.</P>

<P>The estimated cost by major employee categories is projected to be:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Teachers (+8.1%)&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;$2,200,000</LI>
<LI>Instructional Assistants (+2.6%)&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;       50,000</LI>
<LI>Nurses, Guidance Counselors,&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Librarians/Media Specialists (+8.1%)&#9;&#9;     200,000</LI>
<LI>Speech and Occupational Therapists,&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Physicians, etc. (+8.1%)&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;       95,000</LI>

<P>Subsequent State of New Mexico annual percentage increases applicable to employee salaries will enable the District to maintain a competitive edge in the recruitment and retention of quality personnel.</P>

</OL>
</OL>

</B></I><P>The forecasting of human resource needs requires that the District’s stated goal and objectives serve as a basis to determine the number and mix of employees needed to deliver the types of services called for by the District’s objectives.</P>

<P>In Districts the size of Santa Fe, administrators responsible for elementary, secondary, instructional support, and business support services have the primary responsibility for determining future objectives.</P>

<P>The Office of Personnel Services is responsible for developing a human resource forecast to meet the projected objectives of the District.</P>

<P>The review of objectives is not a one-time task but rather a continual process. A systematic and consistent methodology should be designed to forecast accurate projections for each succeeding year and with reasonable trend accuracy over a three- to five-year period of time.</P>

<P>When District objectives have been established and related manpower requirements have been delineated, a more explicit projection of future human resources needs can be developed.</P>

<P>The five most commonly utilized methods include:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1.&#9;<I>Expert Estimate</I>: administrators, principals and other managers use their experience, knowledge, and judgement to estimate needs.</P>

<P>2.&#9;<I>Historical Comparison</I>: past trends, e.g., maternity leaves, military leaves, retirements, terminations, etc. are projected into the future.</P>

<P>3.&#9;<I>Task Analysis</I>: analysis of each type of position classification in terms of task performance requirements is conducted. This analysis can lead to revision of job classifications, elimination of positions, upgrading of job classifications, etc.</P>

<P>4.&#9;<I>Correlation</I>: Human Resources requirements fluctuate in relation to such variables as decreasing/increasing pupil enrollment, fiscal resources, and new programs. A correlation of these variables can be statistically formulated.</P>

<P>5.&#9;<I>Decision-making Models</I>: review of various programs and work processes to determine if they are adequately meeting the expected/established standards of performance within the prescribed timeline parameters.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>A combination of these and other forecasting strategies should be utilized by the District to &quot; . . . develop a systematic and consistent methodology to forecast human resource needs of the District.&quot;</P>

<P>The Human Resources forecasts should be provided to the Superintendent and management staff on a quarterly basis so that recruitment, replacement, and District performance can be achieved in an effective and efficient manner.</P>

<P>The availability of qualified employees has affected educational organizations in recent years in a substantial and critical way. With the current robust growth of our economy, there is more and more competition for &quot;qualified&quot; employees such as teachers. One major element of an effective recruitment strategy is knowing as early as possible the number, mix and grade levels of employees needed, e.g., math, science, bilingual, special education teachers.</P>

<P>If a school district does not have a clear definition of their needs, their recruitment efforts are poorly targeted and generally result in a less than satisfactory conclusion.</P>

<P>In today’s labor market, a major source of employees beyond the recent batch of college graduates includes:</P>


<UL>
<LI></LI>
<LI>retired persons</LI>
<LI>women reentering the workforce</LI>
<LI>retired military personnel.</LI></UL>


<P>More and more school districts are employing people on a part-time basis to meet special instructional or business operations needs (e.g., cafeteria, transportation, custodial, etc.)</P>

<P>A final responsibility of the Office of Personnel Services should be to match the school district’s future human resource needs with current supply.</P>

<P>The Administrative Regulation promulgated in response to the Board’s adopted policy should provide a methodology and a reporting schedule that:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Pinpoints employee shortage areas by classification and time period,</LI>
<LI>Highlights areas of potential overstaffing by classification and time period, and</LI>
<LI>Identifies the number of individuals that need to be recruited to satisfy the District’s quantified needs.</LI></UL>

</B></I><P>School districts across the country are suffering the effects of a shortage of qualified teacher applicants. The national Center for Educational Statistics predicted significant shortages of teachers throughout the 1990s. Unfortunately, their predictions have proven all too valid.</P>

<P>As referenced above in Recommendation 8.4.4, there is a strong possibility that &quot; . . . 95 Santa Fe teachers (11% of the total number) will be eligible to retire at the end of this [school] year . . . &quot;</P>

<P>Retirements plus other factors that will cause current SFPS teachers to leave the District at the end of the current school year (e.g., maternity, movement out of Santa Fe area, decision to change careers, etc.) presents a major challenge to the District and its ability to provide a quality instructional program.</P>

<P>School districts facing similar challenges have implemented a wide variety of recruitment strategies. The Atlanta, Georgia School District recruited math and science teachers from its sister city, Brussels, Belgium; the Chicago Public Schools recruited scores of bilingual teachers from Puerto Rico, Spain, and Mexico; the state of New Jersey created an alternative route to teacher certification which many states such as New Mexico have followed.</P>

<P>Therefore, the recruitment process to fill the anticipated teacher needs of the SFPS will be of critical importance for the 2000-2001 school year.</P>

<P>The major thrust of a sound recruitment effort is not to hire merely to fill a position, but rather to acquire the number and type of people necessary for the present and future success of the SFPS.</P>

<P>Variables that teacher applicants consider when applying to a school system include:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Working conditions: are teachers treated as professionals? Are there opportunities for career growth and enrichment? Are instructional results acknowledged and supported? Is the community a good place to live and bring up children?</LI>
<LI>Salary levels: do salary levels enable teachers to enjoy a reasonable standard of living?  Will salary increases keep pace with cost-of-living increases?</LI>
<LI>Benefits: do SFPS employees enjoy medical, dental, and insurance protections for themselves and their dependents?</LI></UL>


<P>These are the types of variables that impact the decision-making process of most teacher candidates.</P>

<P>Given that the current teacher salary schedule is lower than that offered by the three districts of similar size (e.g., Farmington, Gallup-McKinley County, and Gadsden), as well as by the three close-proximity school districts (e.g., Albuquerque, Espanola, and Los Alamos), SFPS needs to employ a recruitment strategy that addresses other recruitment variables.</P>

<P>Based upon our interviews conducted throughout the District with teachers, administrators, parents, and other community stakeholders, Santa Fe has the potential to reach out on an individual and personal basis to recruit teacher candidates.</P>

<P>When teachers were asked if they knew qualified individuals who could fill teaching positions in Santa Fe, the answer was generally a resounding &quot;Yes.&quot;</P>

<P>When teachers were asked what would be their major concern if they were to encourage an individual to come and teach in Santa Fe, the answer expressed their concern that their personal and professional reputation would be compromised if the working environment did not fulfill expectations of professionalism, growth potential, and constructive acknowledgement of performance.</P>

<P>Teachers interviewed did not list salary as the only determinant that would cause a teacher applicant not to accept employment with the SFPS.</P>

<P>It is, therefore, recommended that an aggressive recruitment policy be developed and implemented that includes a reward and acknowledgement system for teachers and other SFPS employees who successfully identify professional individuals who will accept employment with SFPS.</P>

<P>SFPS teachers and others who choose to participate in the District’s recruitment efforts want to be sure that their professional reputation will be sustained and even enhanced as a result of the positive experiences of the new teachers that they recruited.</P>

<P>Since new funding is limited or non-existent in SFPS at this time, rewarding teachers for their successful recruitment efforts needs to be carefully considered.</P>

<P>It is recommended that consideration be given to rewards that do not have a substantial cost impact such as granting a day off and/or restoring one or two sick days to each teacher who successfully recruits a new teacher to Santa Fe.</P>

</B></I><P>Section 7 of this report - Use of Technology - documents:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Many of the District’s processes that center around data collection and reporting are isolated, limiting the possibilities for discovery that occur when data is integrated. While business applications are abundant, they both create and support the isolation. Having exacted the improvements in productivity for which they were initially implemented, these systems now actually inhibit productivity growth as the expectations of their technologically-savvy users far exceed their capacities.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The current Human Resources/Position Control systems function as two independent and limited sets of information. The Human Resources systems require reconciliation to keep the information consistent across the different databases. Any changes or updates during the year must be manually input, resulting in a significant amount of resources spent attempting to maintain these separate information systems.</P>

<P>The current lack of database integration is and has been a major problem resulting in a lack of automated controls, which places the school district at risk. Extensive approvals, redundant steps, and other time-consuming practices have been incorporated into the daily functions of the Office of Personnel Services procedures.</P>

<P>Over the last few decades the Office of Personnel Services has experienced significant growth and expansion of responsibilities, without essential improvements to the systems that provide support in administering a school district work force in excess of 2,000 employees.</P>

<P>In a small school district, manual processes such as reconciling information between two systems do not take a significant amount of time. However, with more than 2,000 employees, manual reconciliation takes substantially more time. As the number of human resources responsibilities has increased over the years (e.g., affirmative action, credentialing requirements, security background checks, tests for various illegal drugs, university and experience credits, etc.), employee files and district records have increased in both size and complexity.</P>

<P>As the number of independent files and databases increases, so does the duplication of efforts and likelihood of inconsistent information.</P>

<P>Key findings of current Human Resources operations may be summarized as:</P>


<UL>
<LI>There is a lack of system-supported internal controls.</LI>
<LI>Current system limitations result in a large number of manual processes.</LI>
<LI>&quot;Islands of Information&quot; maintained in separate responsibility areas result in inaccurate information and poor customer service.</LI>
<LI>There is a lack of standardization of processes.</LI>
<LI>The current systems are unable to provide the information necessary to support effective decision-making.</LI></UL>


<P>It is therefore recommended that appropriate steps be taken to specify, select, fund, and implement an integrated Human Resources information system which can address all the major issues and problems associated with the management requirements of a complex school system.</P>

<P>A fully integrated Human Resources system would, at a minimum, include the following major functional modules:</P>

<OL TYPE="A">

<OL TYPE="A">

<I><LI>Recruiting</I>, including tracking costs, generating status reports, reconciling job opportunities by location, subject field, grade level, etc.</LI>

<I><LI>Application Processing,</I> which includes tracking number of applicants, job specifications for all open positions, tracking demographic information on each candidate, tracking applicants during the screening process, etc.</LI></OL>
</OL>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>C.&#9;<I>Background Check</I>, including tracking fingerprinting, arrest records, validation of credentials/licenses, etc.</P>

<P>D.&#9;<I>Licensure</I> (e.g., license type, effective dates, reference/file numbers, endorsements, etc.)</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<OL START=5 TYPE="A">

<OL TYPE="A">

<I><LI>Transfers</I>, which involves tracking voluntary transfers, involuntary transfers, transfer requests, etc.</LI>

<I><LI>Employee Information</I> involves capturing and recording employee information such as salary (step and column), current and past position assignments, address, date of employment, education, work history, etc.</LI>

<I><LI>Contracts,</I> e.g., pre-contract checklist status such as TB test, fingerprinting, supplemental job assignments, per diem or per hour rate, etc.</LI>

<I><LI>Substitutes, </I>which includes listing of active/approved by subject/grade level, identification of assignment options/prohibitions, history of assignments, performance appraisals, etc.</LI>

<I><LI>Organizing Modeling,</I> e.g. determine workforce turnover rate, identify critical positions, identify candidates matches for critical positions, monitor available skill sets to match position needs, etc.</LI>

<I><LI>General,</I> i.e., ability to date and maintain historical data such as hire date, salary change, promotion, retirement, resignation, transfer, form letters to employees, etc.</LI>

<I><LI>Summer School</I>: this would include staffing of teachers, generating summer school contracts/assignment authorization, maintaining multiple addresses simultaneously by employee (one for school year and one for the summer), etc.</LI>

<I><LI>Performance Evaluations</I>: this involves tracking and monitoring all employee evaluations, generating notification letters, maintaining evaluation ratings of each employee against district performance standards, etc.</LI></OL>
</OL>

<U>
</U><P>Most integrated Human Resources information systems include a &quot;Position Control&quot; module. Maintenance of an effective position control capability has been a substantial problem in the immediate past for the District. As mentioned in Section 8.3 – Findings, &quot;A cumbersome position control process is in place . . . [it] consists of a form circulated among the various offices . . . for approval . . . .&quot;</P>

<P>A position control module is usually a shared responsibility between a financial department and the personnel services department.</P>

<P>An integrated position control module at a minimum should provide a fail-safe system to control and monitor the number and assignment basis for every assigned position in the District. More specifically, this module should have:</P>


<UL>
<LI>The ability to provide necessary information concerning positions and associated salaries,</LI>
<LI>The ability to track all positions and employees through unique position control numbers,</LI>
<LI>The ability to account for all positions,</LI>
<LI>Automated controls to monitor the assignment of all individuals, </LI>
<LI>The capacity to provide information from any source (i.e., Human Resources/Position Control or Payroll) in uniform and repeatable data points, and</LI>
<LI>Automated calculation and allocation of all employee salaries.</LI></UL>

</B><P>The total cost for an integrated human resource information system as a part of an ERP implementation <B>(see recommendation 7.4.3)</B> is estimated to be $1.5-2.5 million. This cost could be pro-rated over a multiple year period; however, it would be best to implement the ERP within 18 month to three years. Greater efficiencies concerning cost can be achieved by implementing the HR system as a part of the ERP rather than implementing it alone.</P>

</B></I><P>Job descriptions provide each employee with clear direction on how each position functions in the organization and fits into the District’s mission.  Job descriptions should clearly delineate job titles, qualifications, reporting relationships, and job functions, duties, and responsibilities.</P>

<P>Each employee should possess a current job description. Job descriptions are essential components of the performance evaluation process and play an important role in disciplinary actions, such as demotion and dismissal. Job descriptions serve an equally important role when considering whether a disabled applicant or employee can perform essential job functions and to what extent &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; is a possibility.</P>

<P>Job descriptions do exist for most job positions within the SFPS. Job descriptions, however, do not always contain current statements of responsibility, chain-of-command, and job description formats vary widely. Generally, job descriptions contain the basic elements of position title, pay grade, length of work year, and reporting relationships.</P>

<P>Board policy BP4000 (adopted August 17, 1982) states that:</P>
<DIR>

<P>The personnel policies of a school district are an essential part of the program of public education in a community . . . To keep its personnel policies, and the corresponding regulations, in the highest state of effectiveness to achieve the above purposes, the Superintendent is directed to establish the procedures needed.</P>
</DIR>

<P>As indicated in Section 8.3 – Findings, &quot;A version of policies and procedures for the department was undertaken by the previous assistant superintendent some two years ago but not completed . . . No plans are in place for the further revisions of the policies and procedures.&quot;</P>

<P>Article 16, regarding Assignments, of the collective bargaining agreement between SFPS and the Santa Fe Federation of School Employees states that:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1.&#9;It is agreed that the District is responsible for determining job titles/ classifications, qualifications and requirements in accordance with District needs. To this end, the District agrees to meet with the Federation, not less than one (1) time per year, for the purpose of reviewing concerns regarding the essential requirements and qualifications related to any job title/classification.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<OL START=2>

<OL>

<LI>Each employee will be provided a copy of his/her job description when hired and upon revision. Job descriptions shall not be changed without a meeting with the affected employees, the Federation and the affected administrator.&quot;</LI></OL>
</OL>


<P>Current and accurate job descriptions are essential to a well-managed school district.</P>

<P>When entering into a demotion, dismissal, or other disciplinary measure related to job performance, an employee’s job description is a critical element. Any such disciplinary action requires an expenditure of funds, and if the district is not successful in its efforts, this expenditure is wasted. Furthermore, the Americans with Disabilities Act readily focuses on job descriptions. Discrimination complaints from job applicants or employees sustaining injuries or illnesses that are performance-limiting can result in costly judgments against SFPS.</P>

<P>At a minimum, all job descriptions should include job requirements, location of position in overall chain-of-command, relationship to curriculum or customer service, qualifications, pay grade, special features and requirements (e.g., vision, physical dexterity, and physical mobility) other responsibilities and revision dates.</P>

It should be a two-way communication, with the District receiving as much, if not more, information than it disseminates. Santa Fe Public Schools employ a myriad of techniques and practices to engage and inform the community regarding District initiatives, events, and general information. However, the effectiveness of its communication is degraded in that it does not receive much input from the community and its output content to the community is somewhat limited.</P>

<P>Critical to communication is the willingness to receive and act on feedback and remain flexible. Communication is an active ongoing process rather than a one-time event.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Image18.gif" WIDTH=541 HEIGHT=405></P>

<P>As the diagram above indicates, successful communication relies on target audience feedback, which is used to modify the follow-on messages. As members of the target audience perceive that their feedback is heard and acted upon, they become active team members and an integral part of the process.</P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">
</FONT><P>Research indicates that 90% of individuals want face-to-face communication. However, 83% of organizations use print to communicate major messages, but only 28% of organizations find it effective. Video as a communication tool is used by 60% of organizations, but 75% of organizations find the medium ineffective. In summary, organizations must use a variety of communication mediums and find the ones that are the most effective for their target audience.</P>

<P>Communications must be open and honest. Nothing can destroy the ability to communicate more than mistrust. Mistrust can be generated in many ways and we have found that in some school districts the following happens:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Intentional misrepresenting of the facts by one or both parties</LI>
<LI>Releasing of pieces of information versus all the facts</LI>
<LI>Tape recording conversations without permission</LI>
<LI>Twisting the facts to make one side look better or worse</LI>
<LI>Etc.</LI></UL>


<P>Without open and honest communications neither the communicator nor the receiver get the message the school district is trying to convey.</P>

</B></I><P>Some personnel who were interviewed stated that neither District or school administrative personnel adequately support initiatives unless so directed by the Superintendent. An example that was cited was the Back to the School at the Mall that was held in 1999. In 1998 the Superintendent directed participation by District and school administrators and a schedule for their participation was created. The event proved to be a success, as parents had access to school administrators for any questions they might have. However, in 1999, no schedule for participation was created and administrators were not directed to participate. The result was a great lack of participation and the event was not as successful as it had been in previous years.</P>

</B></I><P>Three focus groups were conducted in Santa Fe during the period of December 8, 1999 to December 13, 1999. Two of these focus groups solicited parent feedback and perspectives on the public schools. The third focused on private sector - both profit and not-for-profit business concerns about the Public School District and its economic impact on the community of Santa Fe. It is important to note that, given the small sample interviewed, the results of these focus groups can in no way be considered statistically valid. Rather, they provide more qualitative information about how parents and the business community at large feel about the quality of education in Santa Fe and the kind of relationship they think they have with the Santa Fe Public Schools.</P>

<LI><A NAME="_Toc474558699"><B>Parent Focus Groups</A></LI>
</B><P>Two parent focus groups were held to provide input to the PwC analysis of the Santa Fe Public Schools. In order to obtain a broad-based sample, each of the 28 schools in the Santa Fe Public School District was invited to participate. Each of the District’s 28 school-site parent teacher councils (PTCs) was encouraged to send a representative. Of the 28 schools, 21 sent at least one representative to one of the two focus groups. </P>

<P>The first focus group had a large percentage of representatives from those schools located in the northern Santa Fe schools zones. Fifteen parents came to the lunch time focus group on the 8th of December. They represented the following schools: DeVargas Middle, Wood-Gormley Elementary, Bilingual Early Childhood Center, Atalaya Elementary, Santa Fe High School, Alvord Elementary, Carlos Gilbert Elementary, E.J. Martinez Elementary, Acequia Madre Elementary, Gonzales Elementary, Kearny Elementary, Alameda Middle, and Ortiz Middle Schools. </P>

<P>The second parent focus group was held on December 10, 1999 with nine parent representatives. Five parents who had signed up for the focus group did not attend. The following schools were represented in this focus group: Santa Fe High School, Capshaw Middle, Ortiz Middle, Kaune Elementary, Nava Elementary, Cesar Chavez Elementary, Capital High, Turquoise Trail, Eldorado Elementary, and Atalaya Elementary Schools.</P>

In addition to Chamber leaders, other major business and civic organizations were represented, including St. Vincent Hospital, Bank of Santa Fe, Los Alamos National Bank, Bioreason Technologies, the Rotary Club of Santa Fe, Partners in Education and several small business owners. Rather than focus on curriculum and workforce development, the purpose of this focus group was to solicit input on the Community Feedback portion of the PwC analysis. The format of the business focus group was more open-ended, with dialogue and comments rather than voting. The group ended up spending the majority of the hour and a half discussing concerns and issues about the District.</P>

<P>Overall, the groups responded that they were generally displeased with the operation of the District. The results of the three focus groups can be found in Appendix 11.17.</P>

Ten Advisory Councils were created to research issues specific to the organization of the Advisory Council. Then one member from each of the Advisory Councils would meet together as the Coordinating Council with the Superintendent. The Coordinating Council served as a clearinghouse for issues and projects of the Advisory Councils. The Superintendent should appoint a member of the District staff or schools staff (where appropriate) to represent the District on each Advisory Council. The Superintendent should chair the Coordinating Council. Minutes of each Council’s meetings should be taken and communicated to the community as described earlier in this report. Additionally, the Council meetings should be open to the public and the public should be invited to share ideas and concerns. This means advertising the dates, times, and locations for all Council meetings.</P>

</B><P>The Adopt a School Program is currently grossly under utilized. Not all schools are adopted and, in many of the schools that are adopted, the program exists in name only. In other words, an organization has &quot;adopted&quot; the school but the organization is not providing any support to the school. The District should actively market this program to business leaders, as they may have the greatest capacity to provide support (mentorship, volunteers, monetary assistance, services, etc.) to the school system.</P>

</B><P>The Legislative Action Committee is a group of individuals who lobby the New Mexico State Legislature for additional funding for the District. However, during our interviews we discovered that the District does not provide the committee with a formal briefing packet that the committee could use during its lobbying calls. Additionally, an executive version of the packet could be designed so that the committee member could leave it with the member of the legislature. The briefing should include items such as:</P>

</B><P>A Community Involvement Site Coordinator is located at each of the District’s 28 schools. This individual is a teacher or administrator who volunteers to fill the position and receives a $1,000 a year stipend for his/her services. The coordinator tracks all volunteer activities in the school and is the focal point for information regarding volunteer programs in the school. The coordinators should be represented on the Superintendent’s Support Staff Advisory Council and the Coordinator of Volunteer Programs should be a special advisor to the Superintendent’s Coordinating Council.</P>

</B><P>The District’s Internet homepage could be a very effective communication medium. However, it must be kept current and provide the type of information the receiver wants. As more and more people in the community get computers and have access to the Internet, they will turn to the District’s Internet site for information. It should also be a medium that allows two-way communication. </P>

<P>The current Internet homepage contains information that is incorrect in that it is more than a year old. The site must be updated and kept current. Also, the position of webmaster, responsible for the homepage, must be established. We recommend that it be given to the Technology Resource Center and that the Director of Public Information retain responsibility for homepage content.</P>

</B><P>The Director of Public Information currently briefs community groups when they make a request. However, this is a reactive approach rather than a proactive approach. The Director should aggressively market the District and its programs to the community. This marketing strategy must be a part of the overall communications strategy and linked to the District’s strategic plan. If a more proactive approach is taken to marketing the District, an increased understanding will occur and potentially result in greater volunteer participation and community support.</P>

</B><P>Mentor programs have been established in numerous locations to assist administrators and District staff. The programs give the District a level of expertise it does not currently possess and gives the administrator or staff member a person/s from whom to seek advice and guidance. Districts cannot purchase this type of continuing &quot;consultant&quot; and it has proven to be a beneficial program for both the Districts and the mentors. Santa Fe possesses a wealth of talent in its &quot;active and retired&quot; business forces and its other experts. Many former executives of major corporations have retired in the Santa Fe area and, from our interviews and experience in Santa Fe, they appear to be very interested in volunteering their services.

</B></I><P>The District should conduct community focus groups to gather detailed information about community feelings concerning District operations and education and how the community can help the District. The focus groups PwC conducted as a part of this analysis were only the first step in gathering public opinion. Focus groups differ from Town Hall meetings in that focus groups are more two-way communication, soliciting ideas from a select group of people. Town Hall meetings are intended to provide information and solicit responses on certain topics from anyone in a certain geographic area. Additional focus groups should be conducted with the following groups to assess in what direction the District should proceed and what steps should be taken first:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Parents</LI>
<LI>Teachers</LI>
<LI>District administrative personnel</LI>
<LI>District support personnel (maintenance, custodial, etc.)</LI>

</B></I></FONT><P>The Santa Fe Public School District can make great strides in the management of its organization if it adopts the recommendations above. While PwC understands that it is ambitious to adopt all of them at once, the District’s leadership should develop a detailed plan that allows implementation to begin over a reasonable period of time but not exceeding 12 months. Completion of all recommendations may take up to three years, but the District should begin implementation of all recommendations as soon as possible. This will facilitate gaining and maintaining momentum. To ensure that all customers and stakeholders are aware of the implementation plan it would be beneficial if a citizens’ and employees’ committee were formed to monitor the execution of the plan. This will also help the District to communicate the reasons why any of this report’s recommendations were not chosen for implementation. This would serve as a &quot;report card&quot; for the District and would help to prevent miscommunication and rumors.</P>

<P>Overall, the staff and other personnel with whom the PwC team interacted were courteous, professional, and caring about making needed change. The time is ripe for change and improvement and SFPS should not allow this opportunity to slip between their fingers. This report could serve as the catalyst that brings the community and the District into a true partnership for change.</P>

<P>This information reflects expenditure patterns of over 200 LEAs. These LEAs consisted of urban, suburban and rural school districts in a proportion generally approximating national demographics.</P>

<P>The data contained herein should not be viewed as reflecting a statistically designed and stratified sample of LEAs throughout the United States. Rather, this data while reflecting a large sample of LEAs, consist of only those LEAs that utilize this particular financial reporting methodology. Therefore, the resulting data may be skewed in terms of what statisticians would consider a &quot;valid&quot; national sample.</P>

<P>Those LEAs utilizing this methodology do so for several reasons:</P>


<UL>
<LI>to communicate to various stakeholders easy to understand information on how their tax dollars are spent;</LI>
<LI>to gain management information about how resources tie to LEA mission, goals and objectives; and</LI>
<LI>to establish a performance monitoring process as the basis for a self-improvement management strategy.</LI></UL>


<P>PricewaterhouseCoopers utilizes this information to provide benchmarks to LEAs interested in comparing their resource allocation priorities and practices with similar LEAs.</P>

</B></I><P>The following is an example of the decision matrix used for determining the priority of three URRs with a discussion of each area contained in the matrix.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="Image41.gif" WIDTH=553 HEIGHT=128></P>

<UL>
<LI>Decision Criteria – Criteria on which each URR is rated.</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>Factor – The factor assigned to each decision criteria in determining the value of each URR.</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>URR Raw – The raw score (unfactored) of each URR. If three URRs are being evaluated, the total of the three raw scores for each decision criteria must equal three.</LI>
<LI>URR Factor – The raw score multiplied by the factor.</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>Total Raw – The total for all URR Raw scores.</LI>
<LI>Total Factor – The total for all URR Factor scores.</LI>
<LI>NOTE: In the matrix above the most favorable URR received the higher score. Therefore the higher the score the more favorable the URR. The result above is that URR 3 is the most favorable (factor score of 12.5). The matrix can also be set up with the lowest score as the most favorable.</LI></UL>

</B></I><P>The following questions and issues were reviewed during each of the parent</P>
<P>focus groups. Following each question are statistics of the combined</P>
<P>participant population along with a summary of comments on each question.</P>
<P>(if there were any comments).</P>
<DIR>

<B><P>1.&#9;What are the major issues facing SFPS today and in the near future? (i.e., what major concerns do you have about SFPS?)</P>
</B></DIR>

<P>This question took up a significant part of both parent focus groups. It</P>
<P>was clear the parent representatives felt like this particular forum was the</P>
<P>first that they actually were being listened to in a meaningful way. In</P>
<P>general, parents expressed the idea that the District has been too defensive</P>
<P>to hear their concerns. Parent comments have been organized into broad educational management and instructional categories. Concerns/issues highlighted are those that were expressed frequently and/or felt strongly by group participants.</P>

<B><P>Board of Education</P>


<UL>
</B><LI>It is up to the Board to set policy and create a plan that can be implemented regardless of administrative players</LI>
<LI>Most Board members need to be voted out</LI>
<LI>The current Board has no involvement with the schools. With no idea of what's happening at the site level, how can they direct policy?</LI>
<LI>Many teachers are afraid to confront the Board in fear that they may lose their jobs</LI>
<LI>The State Board of Education must also improve and should also be held accountable for the District's current fiscal problems</LI></UL>


<B><P>Administration</P>


<UL>
</B><LI>The District is simply not taking care of business:</LI></UL>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Not paying bills; PO's not being accepted in town</LI>
<LI>Pure financial mismanagement: "Who stole our money and how do we get it back?"</LI>
<LI>Decisions being made haphazardly or politically</LI>
<LI>No organizational efficiencies and systems. (e.g., lost paperwork for Acequia Madre principal)</LI>
<LI>Hard to find the right person to speak to. Can wait long period to identify person accountable and to get answers</LI></UL>
</UL>



<UL>
<LI>The Administration is only concerned with their job security:</LI></UL>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>They are overpaid to cover themselves</LI>
<LI>High duplication of efforts; feels very top-heavy</LI>
<LI>They are not working for the schools and the kids</LI>
<LI>They abuse privileges, even in spite of low District morale</LI>
<LI>Lack of communication increases level of distrust. "We feel that they are being secretive or trying to cover things up."</LI>
<LI>The Administration's job title should be: "How long to retirement?"</LI>
<LI>The Superintendent is disrespectful of teachers</LI>
<LI>The Administration tries to intimidate teachers and parents</LI>
<LI>They are under siege and operate in survival mode</LI>
<LI>The Administration seems to have no general agreement on what our children need to learn</LI></UL>
</UL>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Individual administrators should be:</LI></UL>
</UL>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>willing to take pay cuts</LI>
<LI>visit schools weekly (one woman suggested that they be rotated back into teaching every third year and receive a teacher's salary)</LI></UL>
</UL>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>One administrator was cited several times in the two focus groups for "cronyism" and lack of qualifications</LI></UL>
</UL>


<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Teachers</P>
</B>

<UL>
<LI>Pay is -- low, ridiculous, not indicative of work they do and of the contribution they make to our community</LI>
<LI>Morale is at an all-time low. Teachers are very discouraged and do not feel valued by the Board or Administration.</LI></UL>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>need professional development to feel valued</LI>
<LI>not treated as professionals</LI>
<LI>treated by Administration as "factory workers"</LI></UL>
</UL>


<UL>
<LI>Teachers should be at top of educational pay/benefit/decision-making chain</LI>
<LI>Should be paid full-time</LI>
<LI>There are not enough teachers; student-teacher ratio is too high</LI>
<LI>Have to pay for the privilege of teaching</LI>
<LI>At high school level, do not have enough time: to plan, to teach, to supervise their students</LI>
<LI>There is a lack of caring, a mean-spiritedness that has begun to set in with teachers, particularly at the middle and high school levels</LI>
<LI>They are afraid to have parents in their rooms</LI></UL>

<B>
<P>Parents</P>
</B>

<UL>
<LI>District reform and improvement cannot happen without more parent involvement</LI></UL>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>parents must be committed mentally and physically in this effort</LI></UL>
</UL>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>the big question is how to get more parents involved</LI></UL>
</UL>


<UL>
<LI>In general, there seems to be a tremendous level of apathy about education both within the District and with parents</LI>
<LI>Parents feel isolated from their children's education</LI></UL>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>they are often not being notified of a child's progress until it is too late</LI></UL>
</UL>


<UL>
<LI>Many are afraid to speak up</LI>
<LI>"We have lost confidence in our District's leadership."</LI>
<LI>Feel very discouraged</LI>
<LI>Many indicate that they have been involved in lots of efforts, offered much support to the District, and helped with many initiatives but nothing ever happens or changes(this is why so many have given up trying to help)</LI></UL>


<B><P>Kids</P>
</B>

<UL>
<LI>Bottom line is that our children are losing out</LI>
<LI>Many are slipping through the cracks and are neglected</LI>
<LI>Our kids are not being educated; we are behind even within the State</LI>
<LI>Too many kids do not speak English; they need extra attention and instruction</LI>
<LI>Children must be motivated to learn</LI>
<LI>Many are bored and lack reason to stay in school</LI>
<LI>Many drop out because of mean-spiritedness, both from other kids and from teachers (Note: at mid and high school level, discussion held about teachers bullying kids and in turn kids bullying other kids)</LI>
<LI>In upper grades, kids get away with a lot (e.g., kids are prohibited to smoke pot on campus, but routinely do so without consequences)</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>Many parents and others feel that it is very important to hear from the kids in our schools during a separate focus group</LI></UL>


<B><P>Curriculum</P>
</B>

<UL>
<LI>Outdated and inappropriate</LI>
<LI>No standards, especially coming out of elementary schools</LI>
<LI>Student performance varies from school to school and even from teacher to teacher</LI>
<LI>There seems to be a lessening of standards</LI>
<LI>The entire community needs to focus on the broader aspects of education beyond the academic (i.e., arts, physical education, music, social and leadership skills)</LI></UL>


<B><P>Supplies/Resources</P>
</B>

<UL>
<LI>Everything is connected to money</LI>
<LI>Many parents complained about lack of supplies and how teachers end up supplementing classroom materials themselves</LI>
<LI>Lack of textbooks and computers</LI>
<LI>Schools seem to operate as isolated pods in terms of resources and communications</LI>
<LI>Parents felt that more was needed of everything</LI>
<LI>There was no money for the building of Capital High School</LI>
<LI>This capital investment resulted in huge pay cuts for teachers</LI></UL>


<B><P>Programs</P>
</B>

<UL>
<LI>Parents were highly discouraged about the lack of funds for special educational programs (Note: One parent and teacher indicated that she is sure that the District is out of compliance in special education)</LI>
<LI>No enrichment programs in many schools</LI>
<LI>Must re-evaluate the qualifying process for enrichment classes</LI>
<LI>Mediation programs are also being cut, and these are key in our community</LI>
<LI>No alternatives for trouble makers--they get stuck in special education, which affects the students there and does not help the troubled kids themselves (Note: several mentions were made about children bringing weapons to schools with no consequences)</LI></UL>


<B><P>Facilities</P>
</B>

<UL>
<LI>&quot;Our schools are unsafe" was a comment aired frequently during the focus groups</LI>
<LI>Lack of basic maintenance/custodial services</LI>
<LI>Bathrooms are disgusting</LI>
<LI>Grounds are also not being maintained: trash everywhere; trees blocking safe views etc.</LI>
<LI>Lack of supervision during lunch and other free time as well as in parking lots (Note: 500 people knew about the possibility of hazing at Santa Fe High School &amp; parents felt that this should be done by a security person and not the teachers)</LI>
<LI>At Cesar Chavez, portables are not tied into main school with security and public address systems--parent had to call Fire Marshall and City to get help</LI></UL>


<B><P>Food</P>
</B>

<UL>
<LI>Milk is often outdated</LI>
<LI>Poor quality; not enough</LI>
<LI>Too hot (spicy) for younger children</LI>
<LI>Schools run out often and older kids do not get food</LI></UL>

<LI>Steve Dilge at Santa Fe High School is excellent</LI>
<LI>They must have vision and high academic expectations</LI>
<LI>They, too, must be held accountable; tend to blame District for problems at their own schools</LI></UL>
<DIR>

<P>Comments:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Should be given a chance</LI>
<LI>Many parents wanted to understand the difference between charter and pilot schools</LI>
<LI>Discussion held in northside focus group with Alvord, a pilot school, representative. She indicated that their Site Leadership Council is composed of a College of Santa Fe representative along with District, teacher, and parent representatives. Since Alvord became a pilot school, their test scores have been Santa Fe' most improved for three years.</LI>
<LI>Concern with site-based management is that the poorer schools will have a hard time recruiting people to serve on a Leadership Council and to help run the schools</LI>
<LI>Need strong leadership both at individual schools and at District</LI>
<LI>Would site-based management mean that District would have less accountability?</LI></UL>

<DIR>

<B><P>10.&#9;Do you believe that SFPS schools have the materials and supplies necessary for instruction in basic skills?</P>
</B></DIR>

<P>Response         Percentage</P>

<DIR>

<B><P>11.&#9;To your knowledge, is SFPS' system of business partnerships with individual schools and effective means of engaging the business and professional communities in the educational process?</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>

<P>Note: no vote was held. Comments were as follows:</P>


<UL>

</B></I><P>The following are comments on various areas that we obtained during the business community focus group.</P>

<B><P>State</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>The State Board of Education is corrupt. How can we trust them to do the right thing for our schools in Santa Fe? Many changes need to be made at this level also</LI>
<LI>Would like more information on how much flexibility is given to the individual districts on how they can spend their money</LI></UL>


<B><P>Financial</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>Past District administrations have overspent the budget and we are paying for it now</LI>
<LI>Pay increases are based on cronyism</LI>
<LI>Total financial mismanagement, inefficiency, ineptness</LI>
<LI>There seems to be no fiscal responsibility either with the administration or the Board</LI>
<LI>Also no checks and balances in place</LI>
<LI>There are limited ways the private sector can give monies to schools. A foundation charter and by-laws had been developed with Leslie Carpenter, but nothing further has happened</LI>
<LI>The money is not getting to the kids. We need to be ensured that the money goes to the classrooms</LI>
<LI>Huge pay inequities for teachers</LI></UL>


<B><P>Community</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>The entire community lacks a vision for our public schools. As a result the Board ends up shifting priorities based on the crisis of the week</LI>
<LI>Low expectations also exist, especially with parents. There is a prevailing attitude of "let's just get by" rather than "let's do our best."</LI>
<LI>Because most jobs in our community are service-oriented there is no need to seek higher education</LI>
<LI>The community needs to hold the Board more accountable for the fiscal problems</LI>
<LI>We have a fundamental problem with the community's ability to offer good, decent jobs. If good jobs are not here, why should students get an education? We end up losing those kids that do get an education and cannot find decent work</LI></UL>


<B><P>Teachers</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>There are great teachers in the system that want to teach. Let's help teachers get back to teaching</LI>
<LI>Morale is at an all-time low</LI>
<LI>The current 30% turnover is frightening</LI>
<LI>Teachers will do whatever the latest requirements dictate</LI>
<LI>Teachers move into administrative field without qualifications or training (e.g., how can you take a teacher and turn him/her into an accountant?)</LI>
<LI>We must treat teachers right</LI>
<LI>If we are losing good teachers, we are failing</LI>
<LI>Teachers are becoming surrogate parents</LI>
<LI>Career counselors end up making a wedge between students and parents; between kids and colleges</LI>
<LI>They do not seem to have a clue on how to help a student get into college</LI></UL>


<B><P>Board</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>Needs to take a hold of the entire situation</LI>
<LI>Sense that the Board is not clear on what their roles should be</LI>
<LI>Key question is whether or not the Board or the community should develop the District's vision for our schools</LI></UL>


<B><P>General Comments</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>The District should look at the running the schools as business</LI>
<LI>Deep lack of trust between community and District. We will need significant mending and reconciliation</LI>
<LI>Leadership has no clue how to even make salaries fair</LI>
<LI>The business community is concerned with the actions taken based on focus groups and study. Lots of input has happened in the past with no follow-up</LI>
<LI>System is so political that accountability cannot be there</LI>
<LI>We need to have pressure put on the District through alternatives - vouchers, charter schools, etc.</LI>
<LI>Schools seem to want money but not help or involvement from businesses</LI>
<LI>The biggest problem with our schools is lack of parent involvement</LI></UL>


<B><P>General Suggestions</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>Would like to see how funds can be redirected and be given better options on how the private sector can contribute</LI>
<LI>Outsourcing expertise would help significantly, creating more efficiency and responsibility. Positions suggested: finance, communications, nutrition</LI>
<LI>The facilities master plan can help to get parents more involved by making them more comfortable and feel more welcomed at school sites</LI>
<LI>Kindergarten is an entry point for both parents and students. Use this year as a way to teach parents on how to use schools and how to be parents to students. "If that's the first contact, organizationally need to implement some program that addresses taking parents by the hand to support their students through school."</LI></UL>


<B><P>Ideas for Partnerships with Business Community</P>
</B><P>Business focus group participants were asked the following question:</P>

<B><P>As a member of the business community what are you doing or could you do to</P>
<P>improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Santa Fe Public School</P>
<P>system?</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>"From bank's perspective, we would support employees helping schools in some capacity on an individual basis. For business to propose anything else to schools is a waste of time</LI>
<LI>To get the business community's attention, serious commitment is needed on part of the schools in getting things started. There is no possibility of true partnerships at this time."</LI>
<LI>Small steps must be taken until business community hears something from the District administration</LI>
<LI>Business community has low confidence/morale now in District</LI>
<LI>Schools do not know how to respond--must be a two-way street</LI>
<LI>A key question is how to get the average parent/employee involved who may be working full time or more</LI>
<LI>Employees should not be penalized by participating in helping the District</LI>
<LI>Our bank has a program in place to match time for employees to participate in the schools from field trip to classroom teaching</LI>
<LI>Mentoring or job shadowing is good and feasible at this time</LI>
<LI>The Rotary Club is putting together a resource directory to be made available to the schools--question is if they will choose to use it</LI>
<LI>Community organizations, Rotary, Santa Fe Economic Development Inc., Chamber of Commerce, Business Incubator, etc. must work together to create real change</LI>
<LI>Having business people give lectures can be very inspiring to high school students</LI>
<LI>Retirees in this community see the school system as something they are not involved with and that needs to change. This force could be energized and could be turning point for schools if they support it</LI>
<LI>We need good publicity, not just newspaper articles</LI>
<LI>Business should consider paying for TV commercials talking about success stories, parent involvement or getting a good education</LI></UL>
