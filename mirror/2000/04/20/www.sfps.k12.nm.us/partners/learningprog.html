<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="33%"><B>Community Endeavor</B>&nbsp;

<P>Since its inception in 1996, the Partners for Learning program has exploded.
The proof that the program is truly a community endeavor lies in the diversity
of our partnerships: health care, higher education, retail, legal, hospitality,
finance, manufacturing, government department and non-profit agencies.
Unique to Santa Fe Public School's Partners program is the involvement
of the Chamber of Commerce and a Business Advisory Council which have added
resources and provided direction in the area of work force development
and employability issues.

<P><B>Our Goals</B>&nbsp;

<P>The Board of Education of Santa Fe Public Schools established the Partners
for Learning Program to:
<UL>Foster Better Understanding of the public Schools system within the
Santa Fe community

<P>Strengthen and enhance learning , achievement and career opportunities
for all students&nbsp;

<P>Create a climate of involvement and interaction between organization
and schools

<P>Provide students with opportunities to develop attitudes and skills
that enhance their well being and success in the working world&nbsp;</UL>

in the Partners for Learning Program, they've invested in their community
and our future What could be more rewarding?

<P><B>Endless Benefits</B>&nbsp;

<P>Volunteers who work one-on-one with a child through our new mentoring

the future , one student at a time. Businesses that get involved find their
image enhanced within the community, and their employees rejuvenated with
the sense of accomplishment that comes form taking positive step to improve
the education of our students. All around, the partners for Learning program
is a win-win-situation.

<P><B>Extraordinary Results</B>&nbsp;

<P>Partner activities are magical. they are fun, exciting and most importantly,
ignite interest and learning in each case and every student. Each business-school
partnership is responsible for the direction their partnership takes. Partnership
steering committees decide together whether to include job shadowing, filed
trips, special reading and writing projects, and so on. The possibilities
are endless.&nbsp;

Building a Better Tomorrow</H2></CENTER>
Its amazing. Students in Santa Fe Public Schools are learning how to successfully
apply classroom lessons to the working world. Business volunteers are teaching
employment. A private foundation has funded a program to place high school
students in career-path employment. A group of CEO level business men and
women are planning curriculum changes and training programs to increase
workforce readiness in our youth. Clubs and organizations are sponsoring
character education programs. Elementary, mid and high school students
are job shadowing in technical, medical, and hospitality professions. And
it does not stop there.

<P>That's because Santa Fe Public Schools Partners for Learning program
taps the talents and resources of more than 30 Santa Fe businesses and
hundreds of volunteers. We want even more businesses and volunteers involved.
There are never enough caring people to strengthen and enhance our schools.
If you're already a partner or volunteer, keep up the good work.

<P>If your business or organization would like to become involved, or if
you would like to become a school volunteer, contact the Offrce of Business
and Community Partnerships, 505/982-2631. A better tomorrow starts today
with all Santa Feans taking an active role in improving our schools.
