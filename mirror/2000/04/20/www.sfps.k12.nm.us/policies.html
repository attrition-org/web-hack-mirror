Enrollment:</H3></CENTER>
Children who reach five years of age before 12:01 a.m. on September 1 are
required to attend school. State law requires school attendance through
age 18 or high school graduation. With special permission, a GED may be
earned at age 17.
<BR>Students are assigned to schools based on geographic location of their
legal guardian's residence. Elementary, middle and high school students
may be granted zone exceptions if the receiving school has sufficient room.
Parents may apply for Interzone Transfers by filling out an interzone transfer
form at the school they wish their child(ren) to attend.

<P>Parents of children entering school for the first time must provide
an immunization record and an official birth or baptismal certificate.

<P>The SFPS Board of Education believes regular attendance in school is
necessary for student achievement.

Testing:</H3></CENTER>
The SFPS District administers the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) at the
3rd, 5th and 8th grades. The 1995-96 scores indicate 3rd graders scored
at the 55 percentile, 5th graders at the 50 percentile and 8th graders
at the 47 percentile.
<BR>New Mexico requires a writing portfolio test at the 4th and 6th grades;
a kindergarten screening in the fall; a 1st and 2nd grade reading checklist
evaluation in the spring; and the New Mexico High School Competency Exam
(NMHSCE) for all high school students. The District continues a writing
portfolio test at 8th grade.

<P>At high school level the Differential Aptitude Test (DAT) is given at
the 9th grade; the PLAN (a preliminary test to the ACT and PSAT) and the
NMHSCE is given to 10th grade students. The Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude
Test (PSAT) and the Armed Service Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) are
available to 11th graders. The American College Test (ACT), the Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT) are available to 11th and 12th graders. Advance Placement (AP)
tests are available to students taking AP courses.

<P>Last year 85% of all 10th grade students in SFPS passed all six subtests
on their first attempt at the NMHSCE. Seven National Merit Semi-Finalists
and two Finalists were identified for the 1995-96 school year.

School Safety:</H3></CENTER>
The School Safety Department provides programs and strategies that enhance
safe learning environments conducive to the educational process.

<P>School safety officers assigned to schools assist school administrators
and teachers with enforcement. A task force of teachers, administrators
and community members developed school policies and student regulations
in the Uniform Code of Conduct for Students that will be implemented in
the 1996-97 school year. The uniform code of conduct shall be enforced
in a strict, fair and consistent fashion.
