<br><br>

Veronica C. Garcia was appointed Superintendent of the Santa Fe Public Schools in April of 1999. She is the second female Superintendent of the District and the first female native to New Mexico to hold this position.
<BR><BR>

Ms. Garcia has been a public school administrator for more than 22 years, is published nationally, and frequently is invited to speak at local, state, and national educational gatherings.
<BR><BR>

She has received the Distinguished Leadership Award eight times from the Academy for Educational Leadership, been featured in Executive Educator, recognized by Nuestras Mujeres as an Outstanding Woman Educator in New Mexico, and received the New Mexico Secretary of State Recognition for Exemplary Dedication and Service for enhancing the quality of life among all peoples in New Mexico.
<BR><BR>


Ms. Garcia was the first member of her family to ever graduate from high school. At present she has earned over 100+ hours above her master's degree and is a doctoral candidate in Education Leadership from the University of New Mexico.
<BR><BR>

Ms. Garcia was appointed principal at New Futures School in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1989. She replaced the school's only principal who held the position for twenty years. In her own style she left New Futures School in 1992 a better place by bringing in additional revenue through grants and increased the number of collaboratives making New Futures School a national model for "One Stop Shopping-Human Services Collaboration." Ms. Garcia was asked to author a chapter in the U.S. Department of Health Publication on the topic.
<BR><BR>

Ms. Garcia was appointed principal of Rio Grande High School in 1992, a very difficult school in Albuquerque's south valley. She was the second female principal at Rio Grande High School in the early 90's. When Ms. Garcia was appointed to Rio Grande High School it was a school divided. The finances in student activities were close to $180,000 in the red, the students had walked out and the school was fraught with gang violence.
<BR><BR>


When Ms. Garcia left the school finances were in the black. Student violence dropped from 17 fights per day to one fight in 20 days. She instituted a principal council that promoted campus peace and communication. She created Rio Grande Alumni-Friends that raised over $20,000 one year in student scholarships. She also established Rio Grande Raven Inc., a non-profit organization that raised money for everything from band instruments to field trips.
<BR><BR>
She left Rio Grande High School to become an Assistant Superintendent in Albuquerque Public Schools in 1995, and came to Santa Fe Public Schools in the fall of 1996 as an Associate Superintendent.
<BR><BR>
Ms. Garcia's appointment as Superintendent in Santa Fe also came at a time filled with much turmoil. She inherited a financial nightmare with significant deficits that would not permit pay raises. She has taken the bull by the horns and has met the problem with brutal honesty and under her leadership, she will bring the district back to solid fiscal responsibility. She has rolled up her sleeves and worked side by side with accountants and other business staff to balance the District's budget. After many months of contentious negotiations, Ms. Garcia actively participated with the negotiation team to come to an agreement that was ratified by Santa Fe Public Schools employees.
<BR><BR>
As an Associate Superintendent, she worked closely with all 28 school sites on a unique accountability system, implementing the New Mexico State Department of Education's Educational Plan for Student Success (EPSS). Additionally, the state has expressed a desire to use the Santa Fe Public School plan as a model for other school districts.
<BR><BR>
It is noteworthy that Ms. Garcia created and implemented a leadership academy for district administrators and principals. It was such a success that the first group has requested a follow up and there are demands to create a second group. All seminars are prepared for and taught by Ms. Garcia herself.

<BR><BR>

In every day and every way Ms. Garcia demonstrates leadership and she is confident that Santa Fe Public Schools will be a flagship school district not only in New Mexico, but also in the nation.
