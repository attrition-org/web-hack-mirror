<OL>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Ms. Tippett stated she was impressed with the diversity of the community.  She stated that it is important that the District have full day kindergarten.  She asked Ms. Garcia why the District does not recruit teachers from Mexico?  Ms. Garcia stated that Mexico has a different certification than New Mexico.  Ms. Tippett asked if the District could look at implementing the science program that was mentioned in public forum and asked if the program was implemented would the District have to eliminate Block Scheduling?  Ms. Garcia stated that the District could implement a modified Block Schedule in order for certain programs to take place.  Ms. Tippett then asked when Ms. Garcia was planning to come to the Board with a recommendation on Monte del Sol using the football field at BF Young?  Ms. Garcia stated that the District is not sure if the school could be placed on the football field.  She also stated that Monte del Sol has asked if the District could be creative and possibly move staff to other sites in order for the District to accommodate the school at BF Young.  She then stated that the staff is not ready at this time to make a recommendation to the Board because there are still other options that the District may want to consider.  Ms. Tippett thanked Mr. Brayfield for following up with the Board on the gang issue. </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Mr. Ochoa advised Ms. Garcia that her group could go and help the buildings trades program after they finish with the habitat house.  He then stated he met with Mr. Roberto Mondragon, who advised him there was a bilingual grant available and asked Ms. Garcia to inform the bilingual director to see how the Santa Fe Public Schools could take advantage of this grant.  He informed Mr. Kelly that maybe the District could look at the possibility of using the alley as a buffer.  He mentioned to Ms. Kitchelle that he supports full day kindergarten but where would the District get the money to pay for it.  He stated the District needs to make sure it is properly funded before it is implemented.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Ms. Sena informed Mr. Kenny that it was important that he reminds the Board about the Salazar issue.  She asked Mr. Brayfeild if he was serious about the gang leaders saying they support the standard dress?  Mr. Brayfield answered her with a "yes".  Ms. Sena then mentioned to Mr. Rodriguez that there has been talked about having the New Mexico culture taught in the Santa Fe Public Schools.  She mentioned that she was not sure in terms of the Mexico culture and maybe this should be brought to the curriculum council.  She stated to Ms. Garcia in terms of Ms. Haley's comments about teachers suggesting that a student should get their GED, the Board and the Superintendent need to be accountable for the student's education.  She asked Ms. Garcia if the principals and teachers could be addressed regarding that issue.  She then informed Ms. Garcia that she would love to be part of her team for the habitat house.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Mr. Martinez stated that he has received some concern that there has not been any input from the coaches regarding the renovations at Santa Fe High School.  He then stated that the full day kindergarten was not the Governor's idea because it has been out there for a long time. He then stated that he would be handing a check to the President to reimburse the District for his registration fee to the NSBA conference. He stated he wished the President had been more supportive.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Ms. Lopez stated that she has heard from a lot of people that they want school reform.  She mentioned that the District wants to work with everyone but the District needs to think of the safety issues first.  She stated that what has passed in legislation for full day kindergarten is not funded.  She mentioned there are some colleges that are trying to match up certifications with Mexico.  She then stated that she really gets upset when people talk about GED's as failing.  She mentioned that her daughter received her GED and now she is attending college.  She stated the GED program is a valuable program.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Mr. Martinez stated that the National School Boards Association Conference comes annually and many programs that the Santa Fe Public School implemented have come from that conference.  He stated that he feels it is important that at least one member attends.  He also asked if the District could find out which elementary schools the students are coming from that are dropping out at the high school level.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Ms. Evans stated she agreed with Mr. Martinez's request to see which elementary schools the dropouts are coming from.  She stated that she had problems in the tenth grade and teachers helped her out and the principals have been wonderful.  She mentioned that she does not want people to think Santa Fe High and Capital High are bad schools but that she does know that the drop out rate needs to be addressed.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Ms. Sena stated she was not sure what the media picked up that the Board was paying but stated that the Board Members could approve a $75 per diem rate to come to the meetings.  She stated that the Board Members do not receive any perks or salaries and does not think it is a big deal when they ask to get training by professionals.  She mentioned that the community has stated that the Board has made poor judgements and they do not know what they are doing but when they want to go for training the community gets unglued.  She stated that she supported Mr. Ochoa attending the conference and did not have problem with the District paying his travel and training.  She also mentioned that since she's been on the Board Mr. Martinez has not missed a conference.  She stated that all members sit on the Board and their time is strictly on a voluntary basis.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Ms. Tippett stated that she was the one who commented in June or July that the money budgeted for Board training and travel should go to the teachers.  She stated that the Board could charge the $75 per diem but thinks the money should go for some training in house and not for Board training.  She mentioned that she would love to attend a financial training in New York City but this was not the year for Board to use money.  She stated that Mr. Ochoa is an exception because next year he will become the President of the Hispanic Caucus and a voting member of the National School Boards Association.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Ms. Lopez stated that it is crucial for Mr. Ochoa to attend the conference and thanked Mr. Martinez for giving back the money for his registration.</LI></P></OL>

He stated that the Board needs to give the program the proper time to grow.  Mr. Ochoa stated that at least four of the Board Members made the commitment to the high schools to give it three years.  He stated that the PriceWaterhouse comments on Block Scheduling were a good example of people reviewing a program and not knowing what the program was about.  He stated that even if he received the information at the eleventh hour he still feels the Board should give the program the three years.  Ms. Garcia apologized for the short notice but the course catalogs and how the school develops the schedule are quite complex and the high schools will be holding pre-registration soon.

Ms. Lopez stated that the PriceWaterhouse report did not address the instructional portion at all.
