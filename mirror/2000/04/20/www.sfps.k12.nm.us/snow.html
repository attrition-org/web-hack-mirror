<LI>After discussions and with input from stateas well as county and city road crews, the General Service Department makes a recommendation to the Superintendent. </LI>

The Director calls local radio and television stations to notify them of the decision. If there is no one at the radio station, a message is left on the answer machine that is usually followed by actual contact later in the morning. </LI></UL>
