<p>First, I'd just like to say this site had poor security.  The Admin was notified 
about this hole, but I guess he/she had more important things to do than to fix it and thank me.
  This wasn't done as an act of violence or to take down your site, but merely to show what
 poor security there is out there.  Even though this is a low-level flaw, it makes 
me cringe to think the countless other of Admins who were notified of problems and simply ignored 
them or didn't know about them, and left crucial systems and vital info vulnerable to attacks.  And believe me, they
 are out there. </p>
<p>It's not completely the Admins fault either; the software and OS companies are partly 
to blame.  They knowingly come out with products that have bugs and security holes, and 
couldn't give two shits as to what the consumer is left susceptible to.  And you can't 
tell me that they didn't know about problems earlier because sometimes the problem is 
staring at you right in the face; just waiting to crash your system or for someone 
to exploit.  Sure, they'll come out with a patch for this, or a fix for that, but by 
then it could be too late, and damage done. Or worse yet, they make you wait and
pay for that fix when the &quot;new and improved&quot; version comes out.&nbsp; Just remember, they're not out looking 
after the consumer, but out after the bottom dollar.  They'll get to you once they get 
their money.</p>


<p>One last thing, CHINA LEAVE TAIWAN ALONE!!!.&nbsp; The people have chosen,
and made their choice.&nbsp; Don't cry because you can't arrest, imprison, beat,
torture, and kill them like you can to the people inside your borders.&nbsp; Oh
yes, we do know and are watching you. US Congress, don't go and do a stupid
thing by changing their trade status to permanent.&nbsp; China should be
scrutinized yearly until conditions are much better, or else it will only get
worse.&nbsp; The people's voice will be heard!!!!!!!</p>
