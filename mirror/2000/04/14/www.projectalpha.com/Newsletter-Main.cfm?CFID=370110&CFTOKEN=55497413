<font size=3 face=arial><b>Allaire Spectra demo a success...</b></font>
<p>
Project Alpha invited Allaire Corp. to speak at our March open house.  The presentation was on how to build an enterprise web site with Allaire Spectra.  The Allaire representatives gave a great presentation to a full house.  Look for more guest speakers at future events.  If you have ideas for topics you would like us to cover we welcome your suggestions.  You can e-mail your requests to <a href="mailto:katrina@projectalpha.com">katrina@projectalpha.com</a>. 
<p>
<font size=3 face=arial><b>Nepal calls...</b></font>
<p>
Rhonda Robb, our incredibly capable Project Manager, is taking a three month leave of absence from Project Alpha to travel in Nepal and India.  We will miss Rhonda and will have a position waiting for her when she returns.
<p>
We are currently interviewing Project Manager candidates and are faced with the challenge of finding an individual with the sensitivity to best represent our clients’ needs throughout the development process.   
<p>
In the meantime, Project Management will be covered by the existing development team. 
<p>
<font size=3 face=arial><b>Customer experience survey...</b></font>
<p>
Project Alpha clients will be receiving a customer experience survey with March invoices.  We really want to know what you think of us.  You can return the survey by mail, send your comments via e-mail to <a href="mailto:katrina@projectalpha.com">katrina@projectalpha.com</a> or call us at 503-273-8051.

<font size=3 face=arial><b>Remote Secretary 3.0 will be launched in March</b></font>
<p>
This has been an exciting year so far here at Project Alpha.  We have seen The Remote Secretary 3.0  develop and become a more universal application.  We are currently in the process of upgrading a few select clients to the Remote Secretary 3.0 to beta test on live sites.
<p> 
We hope to make this more widely available shortly.  Read more about the features of Remote Secretary 3.0 on page 2 of this newsletter and check it out at www.RemoteSecretary.com.   
<p>
A few new acronyms are coming your way...some you may be familiar with and some not.  We’ll be using these terms a lot around Project Alpha in the coming months.  Here are some definitions.
<ul>
<li><b>PSS</b>—Purchased Software Solution 
<li><b>RS</b>—Remote Secretary 
<li><b>ASP</b>—Application Service Provider 
<li><b>XML</b>—Extensible Markup Language 
<li><b>ALT</b>—Application Leasing Technology</ul>
<p>
I look forward to reviewing each in detail in the months to come.

<p>
We've been hearing about Java for years now, with no real results, aside from a few neat applets and other flashy gadgets on some scattered web sites.  Today, Java has finally reached a point where it can be a solid core for Internet infrastructures.  There are essentially three technological innovations that have made this possible: 
<p>
1.  <b>Java Servlet API/Java Server Pages:</b>  An API is an Application Programming Interface, essentially a methodology for utilizing a programming technology.  What the Java Servlet API does is to allow Java coded web pages to perform backend server-side duties.  These can be simple applications that reside on a web server to change text formatting, or even entire e-commerce applications (see www.homedepot.com and note the .jsp file endings - that is the Java Server Pages signature).
<p>
2.  <b>JDBC:</b>  JDBC is Java DataBase Connectivity - a universal way to access databases directly via Java.  For those familiar, ODBC (Open DataBase Connectivity) a while back gave us the ability to openly access numerous databases.  JDBC does the same for Java - universal standards. 
<p>
3.  <b>Enterprise Java Beans:</b>  with the announcement of Allaire's JRun 3.0 Beta, Allaire's Java Server will now have the ability to utilize powerful programming tools. More info at http://www.allaire.com/products/jrun/. 
<p>
The overall benefit is more and better methods to connect to your online database, perform distributed tasks over a network, make your company more efficient and, ultimately, grow your company’s profits.

<font size=5 face=arial><b>Remote Secretary 3.0</b></font>
<p>
Remote Secretary 3.0 is ready!  For those not in the know, Remote Secretary is a powerful site administration tool developed by Project Alpha.  Remote Secretary allows you to add and edit information on your web site simply using a web browser. 
<p>
If you are an existing Remote Secretary customer, Remote Secretary 3.0 can be integrated into your existing Remote Secretary, giving you added power over your site. 
<p>
If you do not currently use Remote Secretary, you are missing out on the ability to keep your site content fresh without paying web site programmers to do it for you. 
<p>
One of the compelling features of Remote Secretary 3.0 (as outlined in Chris’s article last month) is the ability to add pages to your site on the fly.  Additionally, you will gain access to over a dozen  functionality modules including on-line auctions, affiliate applications, and dynamic FAQ pages.  Remote Secretary 3.0 can be customized to manage any web site (whether built by Project Alpha or not). 
<p>
Give us a call to learn how you can upgrade or add Remote Secretary to your site.

<font size=3 face=arial><b>Information Architecture: To navigate or not to navigate...</b></font>
<p>
Information architecture is the science of determining the layout of your web site and then documenting it in a blueprint before your web developers dive in and build the site. Information architecture forms the base for all aspects of a site: form, function, navigation and interface, interaction, and design.
<p>
<b>The hierarchy - laying breadcrumb trails for the user </b>
<br>
The architecture hierarchy lays out the manner in which users can efficiently navigate your site.  A logical hierarchy will help improve your sites usability, which is the key to a successful web site…universally.  No matter what type of navigation systems we build, you'll need the solid foundation of an efficient hierarchy to do it well.
<p>
Some ideas for providing sound information architecture are:
<ul>
<li>Site search features 
<li>Global and local site maps  
<li>Guided tours 
<li>Visual effects to emphasize navigational flow 
<li>Information filtering methods</ul>
<p>
Building a user-friendly, scalable web site is like building a solid house.  A comprehensive architecture of the site (or house) is the beginning of the process, allowing for the development of a sound structure. Even though multiple web sites may share the same objective, whether it is to sell a product, provide pertinent research, etc., each site also has specific needs that are unique to their users.  That’s what we’re here for!  We help our clients develop a look and feel specific unique to them…in this case, through information architecture.

<font size=3 face=arial><b>The Viral Marketing Buzz</b></font>
<p>
As  the parent of a 2-year old, the beginning of Spring brings many good things, one of the best being the end of the “bug” season.  Just as I’m hoping to not hear the word viral until at least October, I am faced with the constant buzz in the Internet world where the term viral is being used to describe a form of marketing.
<p>
The term viral marketing was used first by venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson to describe the fast growing Internet companies they invest in, companies like Hotmail and NetZero.  The term describes the way these Internet companies exponentially grew their businesses via customer word-of-mouth.  Viral marketing techniques encourage people to pass on a marketing message to others.  Viral marketing can require active participation (such as an affiliate program that encourages people to put links on their web sites) or it can be inactive (like the following example of Hotmail).
<p>
Hotmail is the classic case of a successful viral marketing campaign.  Hotmail’s strategy was to give away free e-mail accounts and build up a large customer base that would attract advertising dollars.  Each time an individual sends a message using their Hotmail e-mail account, a small message gets tagged at the bottom (by Hotmail) that says : "Get your private, free e-mail at http://www.hotmail.com".
<p>
The results from this viral form of advertising has been exponential growth for Hotmail helping them grow their user base to over 12 million in their first a year and a half while only spending $500,000 on marketing.  Currently Hotmail signs up over 150,000 every day.  That is viral marketing in action.
<p>
Viral marketing potential is only limited by creativity.  From putting a cool logo on merchandise for a site that appeals to kids, to tagging a “send this article to a friend” link onto your newsletter and discussion lists, viral marketing strategies can be applied to almost any product or service.
<p>
So now is the time to spread your own message.  As we speak, somewhere out there is an Internet Geek, hunched over a petrii dish, working on a vaccine. <a href="mailto:katrina@projectalpha.com">katrina@projectalpha.com</a>
<p>
<font size=3 face=arial><b>Top 10 Sites</b> </font>
<p>
In the spirit of the awards season, here are the top 10 best and worst web sites according to ZDNet Best Practices.
<p>
The bad news first...
<ol>
<li>Reflect.com
<li>Levi’s 
<li>OfficeMax.com 
<li>REI.com
<li>Women.com 
<li>Boo.com
<li>Gloss.com 
<li>Neimanmarcus.com 
<li>Miadora.com and  
<li>Priceline.com.</ol>
<p>
All you have to do to get on this list is make it difficult for your customers to navigate and or purchase products.  There are many ways to do this, but asking to many survey questions (with no ability to bypass them) and focusing too much on flashy graphics seem to be two of the leading ways.
<p>
Conversely, the sites that made the best list did so by making purchasing products quick and easy, and offering services like free shipping or club programs.
<p>
And the Oscars go to:
<ol>
<li>Reel
<li>Amazon 
<li>Bluefly.com
<li>Costco.com 
<li>Williams-Sonoma 
<li>Dellaweddings.com 
<li>Living.com  
<li>MySimon.com 
<li>Brookstone.com 
<li>Wine.com</ol>
