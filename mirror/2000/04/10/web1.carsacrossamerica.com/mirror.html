<br> /*********************************************************************/
<br>This mpaa issue has gone on long enough. We as a global community cannot
afford to let america
<br>control every aspect of our live. This isn't just about copying DVD's
this is about retaining our rights
<br>to intellectual freedoms which the government of america will gladly
allow the mpaa violate. If I purchase
<br>a dvd player I should have the right to do and/or view whatever I want
on my private property. There
<br>should&nbsp; NO territorial lockout or encryption to stop me from using
*my* property to its fullest.
<p>The retarded excuse for territorial lockout given by the movie industry
is that they are able to release
<br>movies in countries at a time that would maximize there profits. The
truth is however rather different
<br>the reason territorial lockout exists on players is, so they can brainwash&nbsp;
harry homeowner with there
<br>own doctrine and minimize the possibility of foreign governments releasing
materials which can be viewed
<br>by harry homeowner that would change his/her mind about certain political
issues.
<br>I fully support 2600's stance against corparate bullies , if mpaa thinks
they can wipeout decss by taking 2600
<br>offline they got another thing coming.
