<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The internet is <b>going to hell</b>. It's
progressing so fast, it's bringing in <b>all types</b>. It's bringing in newbie
script-kiddies, it's bringing in money-hungry corporations and businesses, it's
bringing in rat bastards period. Everybody's trying to a get a piece. The
saddest thing is, <b>it's only going to get worse</b>. That's a terrible thing
for those who have been involved in the internet and the hacking scene for so
long. And with that said, we leave you with words of wisdom from The Posse..</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Ecosystems do not grow without antagonists. The internet (like it or not) has become a<br>
                       virtual ecosystem that would wither and die were it not for the intervention of hackers.<br>
                      Corporate America has entered this ecosystem like a viral fungus, growing ugly clusters of<br>
                      .com decay, spreading misinformation like wildfire and causing the natural predators to be&nbsp;<br>
                           removed from the ecosystem in which they provide a necessary function.<br>
<br>
                                     Corporate America must be removed.<br>
                                            It's us or them.<br>
<br>
                       Take a look at the concrete wastelands that Corporate America has built upon the earth<br>
                       outside your windows. Beneath that concrete there is soil wasted, soil that breeds life.<br>
<br>
                                 They are trying to do the same thing to the internet.<br>
<br>
                        Go outside and try to breathe for just a moment... That stale thickness in the air that&nbsp;<br>
                      threatens to choke you is the poison spewing from their smokestacks... Did you just cough?<br>
                     The phlegm in your throat are their poisons and do you charge them rent ? Did you charge&nbsp;<br>
                             them storage fees for acting as a receptacle for their toxic waste?<br>
<br>
                       They are destroying the world we built to escape the one they have already destroyed!<br>
<br>
                      Corporate America will trade 10 years (minimum) of your life in exchange for another $10<br>
                        in profits. Their poisons, their stifling concrete morgues, their so called "progress"...<br>
<br>
                        They never knew the rules, they followed you here to stalk you... To bilk you for $10<br>
                       they came here because you did. Then when you got in the way of their "progress" they<br>
                       fabricated losses in order to gain FBI attention. They abuse the system and steal your<br>
                                             freedoms.</font></p>
