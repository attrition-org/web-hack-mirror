<p align="left"><big>Have you ever felt that your security was lacking? Well, as I was
rummaging throught your files i saw that you had a directory called &quot;Security
Patches&quot; but, I then realized that you do not know the basics of security, and I am
sure the school board would LOVE to know that you have been using this server as your own
private file storage, to store your pirated software and your 200MB of pornography. It
must be sad to know that someone with only a highschool diploma has owned your ass, but
then you are just an ass, and on a lower note, I have a little messege for you Mr.
SysAdmin, you should recognize the syntax: You are nothing, you will never be anything,
you are stupid, now, GET THE FUCK OFF MY SERVER, bitch. After crashing your server many
times a day as a warning that you were vulnerable, I thought you may have figured out that
there's some shit you needed to look into, but apparently you're not that smart, I'm sorry
for preconceiving your intelligence.</big></p>

<p>I fight the air I'm forced to breathe</p>

<p>I drain the blood I'm forced to bleed</p>

<p>I see what you force me to see</p>

<p>Now it's my turn to live for me</p>

<p>I hide behind the screen that you don't see</p>

<p>This is where I can be me</p>

<p>You can't grasp what you can't see</p>

<p>I am here eternally</p>

<p>You can't stop me, cos I'm inside you</p>

<p>You can't kill me, cos I'm part of you</p>

<p>You can't harness me, cos I suppress in your hate</p>

<p>You can't tame me, cos you can't hide your fear</p>

<p>I'm in your nightmares</p>

<p>I'm in your fears</p>

<p>I'm in your head</p>

<p>I inhabit your tears</p>

<p>I am the shadow beneath your hate</p>

<p>I am the darkness you cannot see</p>

<p>You can't stop me, I am fate</p>

<p>After all, you're bleeding me.</font></p>

<p>-- Me</p>
