<p>0wned by d3tH</p>

<p>hello,</p>

<p>i was just thinking about something that often puts my panties
in a bunch. why is the legal drinking age 21? personally, i think
thats the hugest crock of bullshit ive ever seen. at the age of
18, a person is condsidered a legal adult. so why not give that
legal adult, adult privileges? ive been arrested twice now for
drinking. whats the problem with a couple kids going out to have
a drink? i just got one thing to say.. I havent come across ONE
decent cop yet... next time i see one, im liable to punch the
fucker right in the fuckin nose. thank you and peace out.</p>

<p>by the way, i wanna be in a group so i can be ereet... anyone
feel like admitting me, email me @ <a href="mailto:d3tH420@hotmail.com">d3tH@mad.scientist.com</a> </p>

<p>greetz to: ph33r the b33r (eye fjeer), clientel (your a funny
mother fucker), xhn, logick</p>

<p>fuck you's: all the cops that have a superiority complex...
and that stupid fuckin 1-800-collect asshole (i really hate that
guy)</p>

<p>admin: saved the old page as indexold.htm... *kisses* love ya</p>
