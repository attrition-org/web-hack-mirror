<center><b>India, a Threat to World Security</b>
<p>India's methods for achieving regional hegemony have not
<br>been limited to supporting covert terrorist activities in
<br>neighboring countries alone. Whenever it got the chance,
<br>India unashamedly invaded independent countries in
<br>total defiance to the international law. Kashmir is
<br>not the only case. The Independent State of
<br>Hyderabad, had a population of 14,000,000 and an area of
<br>70,000 sq. miles. It was over-run in 1947 by the
<br>Indian military in a "police-action" to "restore
<br>law and order" there, just as it did in Kashmir. It was later
<br>annexed in the midst of international protests. Then
<br>came the States of Junagadh and Manavadar,
<br>which had acceded to Pakistan and were formally a
<br>part of Pakistan, when they were invaded and annexed
<br>despite protests by Pakistan. The Portuguese colony of
<br>Goa followed. The independent Kingdom of Sikkim on
<br>Indo-Tibetan border suffered a similar fate. In 1971&nbsp;
<br>India organized a major insurgency in the then East
<br>Pakistani province of East Bengal, cut off the air-link
<br>between West and East Pakistan and then invaded to
<br>"restore order". During this period it took full
<br>advantage of its cold war military alliance with the
<br>Communist Bloc, while Pakistan's Western allies
<br>failed to come to its rescue. Even though its military
<br>superiority was clearly established v.v. its
<br>neighbors, India undertook a major re-armament program
<br>with the help of Soviet military after its invasion of
<br>East Pakistan. Citing imaginary security threats
<br>from already intimidated neighbors, India has regularly
<br>inducted weapons of mass destruction to its arsenal. In
<br>1974, merely three years after the immoral, illegal yet
<br>overt act of destabilization and consequent invasion of
<br>East Pakistan, India exploded an atomic bomb right next to
<br>the Pakistani border "for peaceful purposes". After
<br>introducing atomic weapons in the region it went ahead
<br>with the development of thermo-nuclear devices.
<br>Despite claiming credentials to the contrary India has
<br>consistently sabotaged efforts for a global nuclear
<br>disarmament. Its latest action of vetoing the
<br>Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty amply displays the
<br>trigger-happy, power-hungry attitudes of those who rule
<br>in New Delhi. It should be remembered here that India
<br>has repeatedly turned down Pakistan's numerous efforts
<br>(like jointly signing the Nuclear Non-proliferation
<br>Treaty, or the CTBT, or a strictly regional peace
<br>treaty) to bring peace to this region. In fact it
<br>continues to be the only hurdle in the way of peace in
<br>South Asia.
<br>India has gone ahead with a massive program to develop
<br>weapons of mass-destruction with missiles as large as ICBMs,
<br>and other weapons of similar potential, when the rest of
<br>the world is busy dismantling weapons of mass-destruction.
<br>Now the most of Asian continent and Indian Ocean is directly
<br>under the Indian nuclear umbrella. India has left no
<br>stones unturned to acquire and manufacture such global
<br>weapon systems as Nuclear Submarines and Aircraft
<br>Carriers to further its nefarious aims. Countries as
<br>far as Australia felt the heat when they were forced to
<br>re-think their defense policies in face of a growing
<br>and menacing Indian threat.
<br>Such a massive weapons program of global consequences, with an
<br>amply demonstrated desire for territory is reminiscent of
<br>the times when Adolf Hitler embarked on a similarly
<br>massive re-armament program en-route to a global
<br>war. In fact it is ironic, how the dreaded Aryan
<br>symbol, Swastika is as prominent in the Indian Flag
<br>(albeit in a different form) as it was in the Nazi Flag. The
<br>Nazi concept of Super-Man, and the racial superiority of
<br>the so-called Aryans was imported directly from India,
<br>where the non-Aryan portion of its population is (even
<br>today) outcast as being untouchables and sub-humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><b>Adolf Hitler may be dead, but the Nazism and fascism still</b>
<br><b>lives on in the so-called democracy of India.</b></center>
