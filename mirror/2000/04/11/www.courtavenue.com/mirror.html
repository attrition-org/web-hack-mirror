<h1>... fuck censorship! a focus on MPAA(sic).</h1>

<p>You know one thing I am really brassed off about, and it has been going on
since so-called "civilisation" existed. Is how censorship is controling our lives.
Governments control people by the millions through forced relegions, cults, and
conspiracies while ripping us off in the process. Enterprises and Government
work hand in hand to exploit the common people. Enterprises use Governmnet as a
tool to uphold censorship and inevitably generate revenue for them, and
likewise for the government as they reap the taxes in return(that's why the US
government won't take their finger out of their ass, and split up Microsoft
and other overbloated monopolies which are very unethical with their
business stratigies). Hmm, I know what your thinking "Isn't the idea of a 'democratic'
government suppose to let the common people control their government, not the
other way around?!?", yeah an your compleately right .... fascism is still
commonplace even today in 1st world countries.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the attention of MPAA(Motion Picture Association of
America) who are trying to control how we watch DVD's, where we watch them,
who we watch them with(does this include pets such as dust mites?!?), and what
parts we watch. For example "Are we allowed to skip their brainwashing advertisments
and other shit for which they want to control us with?". I feel paranoid when I have
a friend watching a DVD with me just incase I am breaking the law. LOL! :/.
Where does censorship end?! It's all DEEPLY psycological you know!
MPAA have restrained the right for people to write drivers for no computer
operating system other than Microsoft's very own "Windows" range, this means that
you have to loose your precious uptimes of months on your unix systems for a few
hours of entertainment(hardly seems worth it).

<h2>Shouts go to...</h2>

<p>BlazinWeed, phov0s/datawar, and other nigguhs who inspired me.

<h2>Here is the DeCSS code</h2>

<p>This version of the code is for M$ Windows and is in the form of a
".dll"(dynamic link library). It can decrypt any information stored on every
DVD CD, yes it's the code that MPAA don't want anyone just to pass it on
OR EVEN LINK TO IT!!?!? I am deadly serious. It makes you think 
"What are those mother fuckers got to hide?". You could probably find a uu
base64 decoder at <a HREF="http://www.davecentral.com">davecentral</a> for
both Windows and Linux(if your distribution doesn't come with a version
already). See for yourself... .    .</p>
