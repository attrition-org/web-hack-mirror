<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">JOINING NAMBLA was a significant step in my
evolution from isolation&nbsp;to self acceptance. I was exposed for the
first time to others with sexual&nbsp;feelings similar to mine; as heinous
as my thoughts and feelings about boys&nbsp;might have seemed to me there
were others in this world who had similar&nbsp;leanings.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">The first NAMBLA meeting I attended surprised
me because not only&nbsp;were there others like me, they were as diverse
as those of any single-purpose group could be. There was a range of social,
ethnic and political&nbsp;representations. There were people I respected:
men and women who were&nbsp;honest with themselves and others, who saw
the need for examining the&nbsp;issues surrounding the love between children
and adults from broad social, political, legal and personal perspectives
and whom I considered to have&nbsp;personal integrity. My association with
these people has helped me increase&nbsp;my self-respect tremendously.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">As my "perversion" became less perverse, I
started looking outward for&nbsp;sources of my feelings of inadequacy related
to my attraction to boys. The more I&nbsp;examined my life, the more obvious
it became to me that my feelings were not necessarily bad. What was bad
were the repressive&nbsp;measures inflicted upon children who chose to
love an adult completely and&nbsp;upon those adults who chose to so love
a child. Through this exploration, I came to&nbsp;see my repression as
but one facet of a much larger pattern of social and&nbsp;political oppression.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">There is potential for political stagnation
in NAMBLA if we lose sight of&nbsp;this broader context, stagnation which
can occur in spite of the willingness&nbsp;of some members to put their
reputations, jobs and lives on the line to&nbsp;confront the legal system
about cross-generational love and sex. The system&nbsp;arrayed against
us is strong, hence the need for sophisticated political&nbsp;awareness
and wider political support.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">When viewed in a purely sexual context, the
subject of child-adult sex can&nbsp;be quite limited. But it is very difficult
to view it solely in that context. Hard&nbsp;upon the heels of the question
of the legitimacy of children engaging in sex&nbsp;with adults or other
children comes the more important issue of the right of&nbsp;children to
have control of and consent in all areas of their lives, non-sexual&nbsp;as
well as sexual. With the dependency which we adults have fostered in&nbsp;young
people, it would be unrealistic to expect them to assume the full&nbsp;responsibilities
attendant with complete social liberation immediately. But&nbsp;if adults
would admit to prior mistakes in child rearing and undertake it&nbsp;instead
as a process for inculcating self-sufficiency and self respect, then&nbsp;such
a time would be hastened in coming.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">There are reasons for the reluctance of our
political and social institutions&nbsp;to accept the liberation of children.
Principal among these is the concept of&nbsp;children as chattel, that
is, movable property. Legally, children are not&nbsp;owned by their parents,
but nonetheless are completely subject to their&nbsp;parent's domination
and consequently, have the status of slaves.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">Children have no rights. If black people were
barred from the streets after&nbsp;10:00 PM, if women were prohibited from
frequenting video arcades except&nbsp;on weekends, if 30 year olds were
banned from having consensual sex with&nbsp;40 year olds, there would be
a vehement outcry against the obvious&nbsp;discrimination. But in their
supposed wisdom, adults have decided what is&nbsp;right, safe or harmful
for young people. Status offenses (crimes such as&nbsp;truancy, curfew
violations, running away from home and others so defined&nbsp;based solely
on the age of the perpetrator) are by definition discriminatory.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">A logical part of man/boy love should be an
acceptance by the&nbsp;boy-lover of children's liberation as opposed to
externally imposed "children's rights." Children, for example, have the
right in this country not&nbsp;to be treated as an adult in the juvenile
justice system but forfeit as a&nbsp;consequence any and all of the legal
rights adult citizens may possess.&nbsp; Children have a right not to work
at arduous or dangerous jobs (though many do) but have been denied the
right to earn a living and to live independently except at the convenience
and behest of adults. Those rights&nbsp;granted to young people currently
are those which when given still allow for&nbsp;easy maintenance of children
as second class citizens.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">From an acceptance of the concept of children's
liberation it is not a large&nbsp;step to the acceptance of the idea of
general social liberation for all people. When special cases of discrimination
against children are examined, the&nbsp;specialness of the examples diminishes.
The discrimination against&nbsp;children is similar to that experienced
by all socially oppressed and&nbsp;disadvantaged groups in this country
such as women, the aged, lesbians, the&nbsp;poor, the mentally retarded,
gay men, and the physically disadvantaged.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">Ultimately, though, it is not classes or groups
that are oppressed; it is&nbsp;individuals. It is each of us, as it is
each and every child, who is being kept in&nbsp;her or his place, made
to toe the line, to power the economic juggernaut, to&nbsp;fuel the military
machine, to obey the self-serving rules of the oligarchy.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">The liberation of the individual from control
by the oligarchy is the only&nbsp;sure way to the liberation of children.
If boys are to be free to love men in&nbsp;any manner the boy wishes, then
we as members and friends of NAMBLA&nbsp;must be willing to assume active
roles in the struggle for individual&nbsp;liberation in all of its manifestations.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">Our first role would be to become active and
open advocates of freedom&nbsp;for all people. We must become vociferous
supporters of women's&nbsp;liberation, economic self-determination for
people of color, nuclear disarmament (nuclear war being the most sweeping
violation of individual&nbsp;liberties) and other issues seemingly not
directly related to man/boy love.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">Second, we should eschew adherence to political
rectitude but in its stead&nbsp;question all authority including our own
intentions in our political&nbsp;activities. We should promote discussion
and argument on important social&nbsp;issues. This may seem to contradict
the first point, but it does not. Unquestioned acceptance of dogma or a
party line in areas with which one is&nbsp;politically sympathetic does
not provide the environment necessary for&nbsp;growth and needed new perspectives.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">Third, special groups should be allowed their
own rights of decision and&nbsp;self expression. For instance, a woman
I know took umbrage at a gay man's&nbsp;insistence that homosexual women
should be called "gay." Her comment&nbsp;was that all of the homosexual
women she knew, herself included,&nbsp;considered themselves and called
themselves "lesbian." This is not a minor&nbsp;point but reflects the overall
issue of self-determination and self-expression.&nbsp;Identities, names
or designations imposed from without are an indication of&nbsp;the attempted
imposition of external control.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">The need to become aware and involved politically
is particularly acute at&nbsp;this time. The involvement of the FBI, postal
inspectors and police in trying&nbsp;to entrap us is an example of our
government's willingness to restrict and&nbsp;deny personal freedom in
the name of what it claims to be the general&nbsp;welfare. These tactics
are historically-based. There were, for instance, the&nbsp;internment of
the Japanese in the Second World War and the quasi-legal&nbsp;and illegal
tactics used to infiltrate, discredit or destroy anti-war and social&nbsp;activist
groups in the 60's and 70's, including our government's destruction&nbsp;of
the Black Panther Party using violence and killing. This was strikingly&nbsp;similar
to the response to the earlier civil rights movement.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">Issues concerning children cry out for political
action. When will we insist&nbsp;that the government end its policy of
attempted domination of poor,&nbsp;unaligned and "colored" countries with
its attendant hideous massacres of&nbsp;children? How long will we permit
the continued erosion of social&nbsp;programs whose marginal beneficiaries
are those least able to exert political&nbsp;power: the poor, women, the
handicapped—and children? We have imposed upon our children a nightmare
of nuclear destruction because the proliferation and production of nuclear
weapons are good for business:&nbsp;when will we make this planet safe
for our children? When will we allow&nbsp;children the right to do with
their bodies what they please: to love as they&nbsp;wish, to play as they
wish, simply, to live?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">We claim to love children. What price are we
willing to pay to prove it?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">Most of the members of NAMBLA I have known
are white, middle-class&nbsp;men and thus relatively isolated from the
socioeconomic repression felt by&nbsp;large numbers of people on this planet.
We have a responsibility, because of&nbsp;our relative freedom of action,
to the ideal we espouse of complete liberation&nbsp;for children. It cannot
come about in a society where short term economic&nbsp;considerations take
overwhelming precedence over social concerns. There&nbsp;are many ways
of working for a socially responsible society. Minimally, we&nbsp;can wear
buttons or use bumper stickers to urge for social change, and we&nbsp;can
defend the positions they express. More effective and involved&nbsp;techniques
include, but are not limited to, the use of the political system and&nbsp;the
ballot box as weapons for change, involvement in local political&nbsp;organizations
and contributions of money and time to organizations whose&nbsp;goals are
the liberation of all peoples. Extra-legal activities such as tax&nbsp;resistance
or support of draft resistors (perhaps by the establishment of&nbsp;"safe
houses" or underground railways) are more dangerous but still&nbsp;effective
ways of combating a political and social system which is becoming increasingly
repressive. Whatever we do, we must begin by articulating the&nbsp;links
between a boy's right to determine what he does with his body, young&nbsp;people's
rights to greater self-determination, and all individuals' rights to&nbsp;freedom.&nbsp;
</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">But we must act. Failure to act now only signs
the death warrant for&nbsp;individual liberties and guarantees our ultimate
enslavement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>
