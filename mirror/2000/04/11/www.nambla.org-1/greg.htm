<P><B>Hi, how are you? I am 16 years old, and have been involved in a boy-man
relationship since I was 12, and I am still with the same man. My life
is far better now since meeting this guy four years ago. At first there
was plenty of sex and fooling around with each other, and today we are
great friends and continue to have great sex. I feel he sincerely loves
me, and I love him. My relationship, although frowned upon by society,
is the best thing that ever happened to me. You may use my name if you
wish. I am proud of my relationship.</B><BR>
