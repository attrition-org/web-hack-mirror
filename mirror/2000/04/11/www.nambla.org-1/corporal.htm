<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>If you chose the third response as the answer to the above
questions, you have a perfect score. It is a myth of our culture that corporal
abuse of young people by adults is the appropriate and most effective way
to teach them to be cooperative and respectful of others. Every year more
than 60,000 minors are reported to have been beaten, burned, or otherwise
physically abused by adults [Footnote 1] ~ usually their parents or guardians.
And these 60,000 represent only the ones whose abuse is severe enough to
be termed &quot;excessive&quot; or &quot;unreasonable&quot;.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Schools are generally a safer place for young people than
homes ~ at least children are not as likely to be beaten to death there
~ but corporal abuse, rationalized as &quot;discipline&quot; or &quot;motivation
to do better,&quot; still occurs in schools on an all-too-frequent basis.
In Chicago ~ where corporal punishment is officially prohibited in public
schools ~ a substitute teacher told a <I>Chicago Tribune</I> reporter that
she had turned down a permanent assignment to a school because of the way
pupils there were treated. Other teachers at the same school told the reporter
of seeing teachers there &quot;punching pupils in the stomach, throwing
them against the wall, and hitting them with yardsticks, shoes and belts.&quot;
In the same article, a teacher at another school said, &quot;Teachers will
take a yardstick and wind it with masking tape so it doesn't leave a mark.
I see teachers in the lunchroom twisting ears all the time. Maybe 50 percent
of the schools have some physical abuse.&quot;[Footnote 2]</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Illinois is not unique. It is not even the worst. That
distinction presently belongs to the state of Arkansas [Footnote 3], where
one out of every eight students is physically abused by teachers, as opposed
to a national average of one in 28. In Florida, the long-time leader in
corporal abuse of students until recent legislative changes, black students
are still twice as likely to be beaten as their white classmates [Footnote
4]. Students in private schools are more likely to be beaten than those
in public schools, with teachers in so-called &quot;Christian&quot; schools
beating students most often and most severely [Footnote 5]. </FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nancy Berla, director of a hotline project run by the
National Committee for Citizens in Education, says that from the calls
they have received it appears that paddling is applied mostly to younger
students. Of 4,000 calls received by the hotline during their first year
of operation, 70 percent were complaints of physical assaults on students
by teachers. &quot;In many schools teachers carry their paddles attached
to their belts,&quot; says Mrs. Berla. &quot;The teachers are accustomed
to using the paddle on children for petty or trivial behavior, such as
being late to class, not having the right color pencil, missing the school
bus home, talking at lunch time, or being out of their seats without permission.&quot;
[Footnote 6]</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yet young people are still less likely to be assaulted
by a teacher than by a parent or guardian. While it is not a strong one,
the movement to halt physical assaults on students by teachers and principals
is far more popular than the movement to halt all physical assaults on
the young, including those committed by parents.</FONT><BR>

<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+2>Our culture views physical assaults
on young people as acceptable within certain limits of reasonableness.
It is not the physical assault of the minor that is viewed as wrong, but
the abuse of the limited privilege to assault minors granted by this cultural
myth.</FONT></FONT></I></H4>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="colorbar.gif" HEIGHT=3 WIDTH=600></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Our cultural mythology views physical assaults on young
people as acceptable within certain &quot;limits of reasonableness.&quot;
[Footnote 7] It is not the physical assault of the minor that is viewed
as wrong, but the &quot;abuse&quot; of the &quot;limited privilege&quot;
to assault minors granted by this cultural myth.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A much stronger, more popular movement today has been
mounted around the increase in reports of sexual assaults on young people
by adults. These assaults are characterized as typical of all sexual contacts
between young people and adults because another cultural myth says that
all intergenerational sexual contact is unwanted by the younger partner,
who therefore must be forced, tricked, or bribed into participating. Both
consenting and non-consenting sexual activity involving young people and
adults are often referred to as &quot;child molestation,&quot; rather than
&quot;child abuse.&quot; The word &quot;molestation&quot; means &quot;unwanted
contact.&quot; In recent years, the word has become synonymous with &quot;sexual
molestation,&quot; in the same way that &quot;intercourse&quot; has become
synonymous with &quot;sexual intercourse.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But molestation is any kind of unwanted contact. And while
the &quot;spank me if you love me&quot; advocates may claim that young
people benefit from beatings by adults as punishment for failing to continually
please them, Edward Zeigler, who heads the psychology section of the Child
Study Center at Yale University, finds that &quot;today there is total
consensus among behavioral scientists that hard discipline is counter-productive.
It only teaches children that people who are big and strong can do what
they want.&quot; [Footnote 8] Educational psychologists G. Roy Mayer and
Tom Butterworth, in a three-year study involving 18 schools, found that
by training teachers to praise and otherwise reward students for wanted
behavior (instead of punishing them for unwanted behavior), not only did
school vandalism costs go down by an average of 75 percent, but &quot;hitting,
throwing objects, not doing assigned work and other kinds of inappropriate
behavior decreased as teachers acquired the knack of using positive reinforcement.&quot;
[Footnote 9]</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Every corporal assault is contact unwanted by young persons,
and therefore constitutes molestation, even when claimed to be justified
as discipline. Cultural myths which hold that any type of physical assault
can be &quot;reasonable&quot; or &quot;effective&quot; as discipline, or
that any amount of physical abuse, however slight, is less than excessive,
should be exploded for the benefit of all.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<H4><FONT SIZE=+1>At present there are no jurisdictions in the U.S. where
all hitting of young people by their parents is illegal. [Footnote 10]
There are also no jurisdictions where young people have the right to initiate
or participate in any type of erotic activity with adults. Is this a coincidence,
or is there a connection? Why are those who defend corporal punishment
as necessary and proper so often the same ones concerned about protecting
young people from all sexual experiences?</FONT><BR>
</H4>

<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+2>Every corporal assault is contact

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="colorbar.gif" HEIGHT=3 WIDTH=600></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Two frequently cited goals of the current anti-child sexual
molestation movement are that &quot;children should be told they have the
right to say 'no',&quot; and that &quot;children should be taught that
their bodies belong to them and that no one has the right to touch them
without their permission.&quot; Achieving these goals would be a great
help in empowering young people to deal with the problems of unwanted sexual
contacts.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There is an obvious conflict, however, between those two
goals and the lessons young people learn every day from corporal punishment.</FONT></P>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;You have the right to say 'no'. / Now go upstairs
and do your homework. DON'T SAY 'NO' TO ME! If you EVER say 'no' to me
again, I'll slap you so hard you won't know what hit you!&quot; and, &quot;Your
body belongs to you. / Now stop slouching in that chair and sit up straight
while you can still sit down!&quot; and, &quot;No one can touch your body
without your permission. / If you don't clean up this room, I'll take a
yardstick and break it on your behind!&quot; are all examples of the conflicting
messages many young people today are receiving from parents and teachers.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="colorbar.gif" HEIGHT=3 WIDTH=600></P></CENTER>

<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+2>If there is a first step towards
empowering young people, it is to abolish the privilege of adults to physically
abuse the young. While calling for the abolition of age-of-consent laws
is important and necessary, not many young people would consider legal
sex as important as freedom from the physical assaults they face on a daily
basis.</FONT></FONT></I></H4>

<CENTER><P><BR>
<IMG SRC="colorbar.gif" HEIGHT=3 WIDTH=600></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Assuming that young people are neither as irrational nor
as schizophrenic as the adults who control their lives, which message will
they believe? How long will it take them to figure out that when someone
tells them they have a right to say &quot;no&quot;, that person is lying?
That they have no such right, only a dictate from society that they must
say &quot;no&quot; to all sexual offers or be prepared to suffer the legal
consequences? How long will it be before they realize that they may not
do with their bodies as they choose, but only as those adults in control
demand? How long will it be before they realize that who touches their
bodies and how do not depend on who has their permission, but on who has
the legal authority?</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And once young people realize these things (which should
not take any longer than their next beating), how long will it be before
they, and concerned adults, begin to do something substantive to change
the status of young people in our society?</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Gabriela Mistral, Chile's Nobel prize winning poet, answers
that question in this way:</FONT><BR>
</P>

<UL>
<P><I><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;<B>Many of the things we need can wait. The child
cannot. Right now is the time his bones are being formed, his blood is
being made, and his senses are being developed. To him we cannot answer
'tomorrow.' His name is 'today.'</B>&quot;</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=+1>[Footnote
11]</FONT><BR>
<BR>
</P>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If there is a first step towards empowering the young,
it is not lying to them about a right to say &quot;no.&quot; And while
calling for the abolition of age-of-consent laws is important and necessary,
not many young people would consider legal sex as important as freedom
from the physical assaults that all of them risk facing on a daily basis.
If there is a first step towards empowerment, it is to abolish the privilege
of adults to physically abuse young people.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are several organizations addressing this issue.
One is the National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse, P.O. Box
94283, Chicago, IL 60690. Another is EVAN-G, the Committee to End Violence
Against the Next Generation, Inc., 977 Keeler Avenue, Berkeley, CA 94708,
a group whose aim is to end corporal punishment in schools and whose quarterly
newsletter, <I>The Last ? Resort</I>, is the primary source for the data
used in this article. In addition, many other groups, including the A.C.L.U.,
address the issue of corporal punishment in one way or another.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And if none of these groups seems right for you, you can
always start your own. <I>The Children's Rights Handbook</I>, published
by Youth Liberation Press, 2007 Washtenaw Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI 49194,
tells you how. Although the handbook is out of print, copies can be found
in many alternative bookstores.</FONT></P>
