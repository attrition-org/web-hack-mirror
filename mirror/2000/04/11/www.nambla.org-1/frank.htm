<P><B>Hi. My name is Frank and I am 15 years old. I would like very much
to write and voice my opinion in favor of man/boy relationships.</B><BR>
</P>

<P><B>I first met Bill, who is a boy-lover and 29 years old, when I was
11 years old. I met him at the local PAL (Police Athletic League), where
I am a member. At first I was a little scared of him because I knew what
he liked to do with boys. But after a while I started to trust him, and
he never touched me until I was 13, and it was me who started it.</B><BR>
</P>

<P><B>I enjoy sex with him a lot, and he knows exactly how to please me.
We like mutual masturbation most of the time, but usually we just do whatever
comes into our heads.</B><BR>
</P>

<P><B>Bill is the one person I can really be myself around, and I don't
think sex with him is wrong or harmful to my development. I have a girlfriend,
and we have sex very often, but sex with Bill is exciting because I have
been taught how to enjoy my body.</B><BR>
</P>

<P><B>I hope more young guys write in also. Please use my name and address
if you like.</B><BR>
