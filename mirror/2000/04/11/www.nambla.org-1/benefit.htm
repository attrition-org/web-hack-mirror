<P><B>Consensual intergenerational experiences of younger people are often
quite positive and beneficial for the participants, regardless of their
ages. In contrast, non-consensual experiences, when the wishes of the youngster
are disregarded, can be very damaging. These clearly are the lessons to
be drawn from <A HREF="#studies">recent scientific studies of sexual experiences
between men and boys</A>. Studies conducted by victimologists and people
who seek to regulate the sexual behavior of others have obscured and hidden
these facts from the public.</B></P>

<P><B>A major study of over 8,000 German youth who had been reported as
&quot;victims&quot; in criminal cases was conducted by Michael Baurmann
for the German state police agency (similar to the FBI in the US). Using
the opinions of the youth, the opinions of experts, and standard psychological
assessments, Baurmann found that none of the boys had been harmed. Boys
under 14 years of age were between 10% and 15% of the total cases studied.
However, other factors were at work in the experiences of girls. Click
here for <A HREF="baurmann.htm">the English summary of Baurmann's findings</A>.</B></P>

<P><B>The outcomes of sexual experiences between adults and younger people
primarily depend upon whether the sex was consensual. Also, sexual experiences
are powerfully influenced by expectations and the attitudes toward sex
which have been passed on to younger people by their parents and social
environment. Rigidly anti-sexual attitudes and fears can predispose anyone
to harm. Boys often approach sex with great interest and enthusiasm, so
that their <A HREF="money1.htm">consensual sexual experiences</A> are <A HREF="hertoft.htm">not
harmful</A>.</B></P>

<P><B>Once sexual experiences have become known to others, secondary harm
to youngsters can be induced by the reactions of parents, police, social
workers, lawyers and other adults, where no apparent harm results from
the sexual contact itself.</B></P>

<P>I<B>f people are not taught to despise their bodies and fear sex, if
their sexual choices are not forced on them by others, and if they are
not subjected to harsh or stigmatizing reactions to their sexual choices
and experiences, they will not be harmed by having sex, regardless of how
old or young they are or with whom they have sex.</B></P>

A massive longitudinal study of all reported victims of sex offenses against
minors in the German State of Lower Saxony during a four-year period from
1969-1972, with six to ten year follow-ups, under the direction of the
German Ministry of Justice. The total sample is over 8,000, including over
800 boys up to age 14. Violence and/or coercion were present in roughly
half the reported offenses against girls, and were correlated with negative
outcomes. <B>None of the boys experienced force or coercion</B>, and <B>no
negative outcomes were observed for any of the boys</B>. The study used
both subjective and multiple standardized objective measures. <B>It is
by far the most in-depth large study and the largest in-depth study in
this field.</B> </P>

Among the findings of this major literature review:<BR>
<B>&quot;The most important determinant in the outcome of childhood incest
or adult-child sexual encounters is the child's perception of freedom of
choice in participating.</B>&quot; Among the observed implications:<BR>
<B>&quot;The research to date points to the child's subjective experience
as the central concern. If it is the child's person which is to be protected
from being violated against the child's will, then it is the child's will
which governs the determination.</B>&quot;</P>
