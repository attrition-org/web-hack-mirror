love that dare not speak its name&quot;</FONT>?</I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>Wilde</B>:</FONT> <B><I>&quot;The Love that
dare not speak its name&quot; in this century is such a great affection
of an elder for a younger man as there was between David and Jonathan,
such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy, and such as you find
in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare. It is that deep, spiritual
affection that is as pure as it is perfect. It dictates and pervades great
works of art like those of Shakespeare and Michelangelo, and those two
letters of mine, such as they are. It is in this century misunderstood,
so much misunderstood that it may be described as the &quot;Love that dare
not speak its name,&quot; and on account of it I am placed where I am now.
It is beautiful, it is fine, it is the noblest form of affection. There
is nothing unnatural about it. It is intellectual, and it repeatedly exists
between an elder and a younger man, when the elder man has intellect, and
the younger man has all the joy, hope and glamour of life before him. That
it should be so, the world does not understand. The world mocks at it and
sometimes puts one in the pillory for it.&quot;</I></B></P>
