<P>Kepner's career as a founder of today's gay movement began at 19 years
of age when he learned that many of our cultural heroes -- such as Sappho,
Socrates, Francis Bacon, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Shakespeare,
Walt Whitman, and Oscar Wilde -- were all part of a vital gay tradition.

Kepner's own story</A>.</P>

<P>Kepner recognized that boy-lovers play an important role in gay history,
which he outlined at NAMBLA's General Membership Conference in 1986. He
said, &quot;Too many in our movement, victims themselves of prejudice and
discrimination, pass those hatreds and fears to drag queens, pedophiles,
bisexuals, leather men and women, transsexuals, and many other minorities
within our community. We talk nicely about diversity, but practicing it
is more difficult.&quot; <A HREF="kepner1.htm">His statement</A> has been
widely quoted on the internet. As a gay historian, Kepner also recognized
the importance of <A HREF="http://www.usc.edu/Library/oneigla/Breen.html">Walter
Breen's</A> work, <B><I><A HREF="http://www.usc.edu/Library/oneigla/Breen.html">Greek
Love</A></I></B> (published under the pseudonym, <A HREF="http://www.usc.edu/Library/oneigla/Breen.html">J.
Z. Eglinton</A>). </P>

<P>Although his health was fading, Kepner marched the entire parade route
for the Spirit of Stonewall march in New York City in 1994 with NAMBLA
and 10,000 others to affirm the unity of all lesbian, bisexual, transgendered
and gay people against oppression. </P>
