<P><B>&quot;In those cases where children do have sex with their homosexual
elders... I submit that often, very often, the child desires the activity,
and perhaps even solicits it, either because of a natural curiosity...
or because he or she is homosexual and innately knows it. ... And unlike
girls or women forced into rape or traumatized, most gay men have warm
memories of their earliest and early sexual encounters; when we share these
stories with each other, they are invariably positive ones.&quot;</B><BR>
