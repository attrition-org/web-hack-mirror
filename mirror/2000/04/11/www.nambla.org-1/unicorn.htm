<P><B>I support NAMBLA because they have given me a chance to philosophize
publicly by printing my column. NAMBLA gave me support after the arrest
of my man-friend. They have made me comfortable in a gay atmosphere. They
take criticism well and always rectify mistakes.</B><BR>
</P>

<P><B>NAMBLA does not lay low on the subject of youth emancipation. NAMBLA
supports youth liberation and emancipation. NAMBLA is against the draft,
circumcision and clitoridectomy, ageism and other positions pertaining
to youth.</B><BR>
</P>

<P><B>NAMBLA, in my view, is a very revolutionary organization. &nbsp;NAMBLA
puts out the <I><A HREF="bulletin.htm">Bulletin</A>,</I> which is the only
magazine of its kind in the U.S. &nbsp;Many NAMBLA members discontinued
their sex lives in order to preach the truth about intergenerational sex.
&nbsp;NAMBLA members are lovers who seek major changes in the structure
of society.</B></P>

<P><B>So how could I not support NAMBLA? They are true gay people. They
understand that gayness starts at a young age, too. Love comes in all forms,
so a relationship should not be deemed wrong unless it is provable that
the sex act was unconsensual. I believe in a sexual revolution. To quote
Che Guevera, &quot;The true revolutionary is guided by great feelings of
love.&quot; Keep up the good work, NAMBLA! </B></P>

<P><B>To the editors of the <I>N.Y.C. NEWS..</I></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B>Hello! I want to dispel the myth that children do not have the ability
to decide what they want to do with their lives. Children are people. Some
children have good ideas and others don't. Children are human. Age is an
irrelevant factor in the ability to comprehend rationally. There are totally
irrational and totally irresponsible adults out in the world.</B><BR>
</P>

<P><B>I am twelve years old. I have been gay from a very young age and
I feel that I am as much a gay person as someone walking down Christopher
St. or the Castro or any so called gay neighborhood. Some gays do not recognize
that a young person could be gay.</B><BR>
</P>

<P><B>I believe in gay liberation. Gay liberation must include all aspects
of the sexual freedom struggle. Young gays should be made to feel at home
in the gay community. The gay rights lobby denounces the &quot;lunatic
fringe&quot; groups (boy lovers, TVs, S&amp;M, etc) to gain a more &quot;respectable&quot;
look, and to collect funds from liberal politicians at election time. These
actions could destroy the gay liberation struggle by splitting the gay
movement. If we are to survive, all froms of gayness must be accepted.</B></P>

<P><B>One of the most important lessons you must learn about liberation
is that you never sell out to the people oppressing you. The time is here
where we must stay by our convictions and be ourselves, in order to show
that no matter what they do to us, our ideas will live on in other peoples
minds. We must flaunt love and fight oppression.</B></P>

<P><B>Changes are not made overnight. In order to change attitudes, we
must find a dialogue to communicate with parents and authorities. In my
life I just leveled with my mother. At first she didn't know whether I
thought I was gay or just experimenting with gayness. She is fully supportive
of my decision to be gay. Most parents are not like this, though.</B><BR>
</P>

<P><B>I am gay. I am proud. Please be supportive of young gays. It's hard
enough for adults to be gay. It is almost impossible for a gay boy to have
a good healthy open relationship because of the atmosphere of the community
towards youth. I accept all. You should too.</B><BR>
</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours in the struggle for liberation,</B><BR>
