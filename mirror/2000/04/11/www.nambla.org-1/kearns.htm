<P><B>&quot;I... have a friend facing a possible jail sentence for having
sex with a couple of 15- year-olds. I love my friend; he is a good person.
At the preliminary trial, it became evident to me that the &quot;victims&quot;
were the seducers, who had already repeatedly had sex with each other.
But in the eyes of the court, their age is the sole determining factor
to be weighed....<BR>
From tea room to drag queen, I applaud every gay subculture.... Discrimination
among ourselves is profoundly self-destructive. NAMBLA deserves to be heard
and respected.&quot;</B><BR>
