read <I>The NAMBLA Bulletin</I> fairly regularly and I think it is one
of the most intelligent discussions of sexuality I've ever found. ... Before
you start judging what NAMBLA is about, expose yourself to it and see what
it is really about, the issues they are really talking about; and deal
with what's really there rather than this demonized notion of guys running
about trying to screw little boys. I would have been so much happier as
an adolescent if NAMBLA had been around when I was 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.&quot;</B></P>
