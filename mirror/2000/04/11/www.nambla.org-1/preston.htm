<P><B>&quot;Sex between youths and adults is one of the most difficult
issues in the gay movement. When does a youngster have the right and the
power to make his own sexual decisions? How are laws against intergenerational
sex used specifically to target gay men? What are the issues that make
the romantic image of the Greek teacher and his student in times of antiquity
turn into something ugly and forbidden in the modern age? If you want to
explore these issues, NAMBLA is the organization that will supply you with
brochures, thought-provoking books and booklets.&quot;</B><BR>
