another &quot;Communications Decency Act&quot;! &nbsp;&nbsp;Suit has been
filed in Federal court to stop the tampering with communication on the
Internet. &nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation contains most of the unconstitutional
flaws of the original CDA: </FONT></FONT></P>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Though the sponsors of CDA&nbsp;II claim it is intended
to address only commercial pornographers intentionally targeting minors,
the actual language of the bill is vague and overbroad, and will sweep
in much more than explicit for-profit visual materials. The bill will censor
a wide variety of legitimate, protected expression, for adults as well
as children. </FONT><BR>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Congress's own posting of the Starr report would likely
violate this Act of Congress. </FONT><BR>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+1>What is appropriate for some 5-year-olds is not the same
thing as what is appropriate for some 16-year-olds, and this bill fails
to take account of this basic fact. </FONT><BR>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Intentionally providing a minor with &quot;harmful matter&quot;,
online or offline, is already illegal under general obscenity and harmful-to-minor
statutes. Congress cannot expand this to a ban on all online publication
(which the bill amounts to; the Supreme Court has already found that the
kind of age verification this bill, like the CDA, calls for is impractical).
