<P><B>I'm writing in response to your request for letters from boys about
our experiences with men. I am a 16-year-old black high school student
from Queens. I haven't had that much experience with men, but I've had
good relationships with two in particular. One of them is very close to
me. We've known each other since I was 10 years old. He is a school teacher
who lives out of town, but he comes to visit frequently. He is a good friend.
We can relate to each other because he listens to me, unlike most people.
Whenever I need to talk, I can always call him, because he understands
me and always lends an open ear to my problems.</B></P>

<P><B>Recently, I've met another gay man, who is in his late thirties.
I've grown to like him a lot also. He's very interested in politics, and
he inspires me because he has so much energy, puts so much into his activities,
and still finds time for his friends.</B></P>
