Anthropological Evidence on Homosexual Relations," <i>Journal of Homosexuality</i>,
Vol. 11, No. 3/4, pp. 19-34, Summer 1985. (Also published as <i>The Many
Faces of Homosexuality: Anthropological Approaches to Homosexual Behavior</i>.
New York: Harrington Park Press, 1986.)
<br>Compares data from 19 different named cultures, and many more not named,
where man/boy homosexual relationships are institutionalized, to support
the view that the kinship structures of a society largely determine the
prevalent modes of sexual expression in that society, whatever they may
be.
<p>Baurmann, M. C.&nbsp; <i><a href="baurmann.htm">Sexuality, Violence,
and Psychological After-Effects: A Longitudinal Study of Cases of Sexual
Assault which were Reported to the Police</a></i>. Wiesbaden: Bundeskriminalamt,
1988.
<br>A massive longitudinal study of all reported victims of sex offenses
against minors in the German State of Lower Saxony during a four-year period
from 1969-1972, with six to ten year follow-ups, under the direction of
the German Ministry of Justice. The total sample is over 8,000, including
over 800 boys up to age 14. Violence and/or coercion were present in roughly
half the reported offenses against girls, and were correlated with negative
outcomes. <b>None of the boys experienced force or coercion</b>, and <b>no
negative outcomes were observed for any of the boys</b>. The study used
both subjective and multiple standardized objective measures. <b>It is
by far the most in-depth large study and the largest in-depth study in
this field.</b>

<p>Best, Joel&nbsp; <i>Threatened Children: Rhetoric &amp; Concern about
Child Victims</i>. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990.
<br>A highly recommended, pioneering survey of <b>a constellation of social
problems</b> and their recent magnification. Provides thorough statistical
evaluations and analyses of the most common fears and prejudices underlying
society's concerns about child abduction, sexual abuse, and other urban
myths, from a sociological perspective. Describes media pandering to public
fears.

New Perspectives</i>. Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1981.
<br>Reviews 30 studies, most of which include child-adult contacts. Breaks
down experiences by outcome for the younger partner as: positive, neutral,
or negative. Examines relationships between several variables and observed
outcomes.
<p>Constantine, Larry L. "Child Sexuality: Recent Developments and Implications
for Treatment, Prevention, and Social Policy," <i>International Journal
of Medicine and Law</i>, 1983 No. 2, pp. 55-67.
<br>Reviews findings of the above article. Discusses implications for treatment,
prevention, and social policy. Includes proposals for legal revisions.
<br>Among the findings of this major literature review:
<br><b>"The most important determinant in the outcome of childhood incest
or adult-child sexual encounters is the child's perception of freedom of
choice in participating.</b>" Among the observed implications:
<br><b>"The research to date points to the child's subjective experience
as the central concern. If it is the child's person which is to be protected
from being violated against the child's will, then it is the child's will
which governs the determination.</b>"

prevalence, characteristics, and associated problems of non-consensual
sex in men: Cross sectional survey.&nbsp; <i>British Medical Journal, 318</i>,
pp. 846-850.
<br>Important new study. The data presented in this research report indicate
that non-consensual sexual experiences before and after age 16 are associated
with increased psychological problems, but consensual sexual experiences
are not.&nbsp; This is the first large empirical study to present data,
in English, that directly addresses the question of the significance of
consent.

<br>An unusually detailed investigation of two consensual long-term "pedophiliac"

to be non-harmful and possibly beneficial for both partners. Money is among
the most widely cited American authors on pediatric sexology and sexual

recommended reading.

<br>A critical and extensive review of the literature. Okami finds that
" ... <b>professionals in the field continue to express belief in a 'typical'
psychological profile for pedophiles ... Empirical support is equivocal
and in certain cases absent</b>(p. 306). <b>... With the exception of the
tautological diagnosis of "sexual deviate," little clinically significant
pathology was found among either "pedophiles" or "sex offenders against
minors."&nbsp; </b>(Abstract)
