<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;My own initiation came long before I was legally
adult. Though a number of males around my age offered to participate, a
woman ten years my senior was &quot;responsible,&quot; at my invitation
and encouragement. The only fault I find with that part of my sexual education
was the limit her guilt and fear put on our pleasure, the heterosexual
pressure even she felt required to put on me. What she did &quot;for my
own good&quot; caused both of us pain. If I were to improve on that experience
now, it would not be to protect children from adult seduction but to make
adults easier to seduce, less burdened with fear or guilt, less defended
by hypocrisy. ...<BR>
If we accepted sexual behaviour between children and adults, we would be
far more able to protect our children from abuse and exploitation than
we are now.&quot;</FONT></B><BR>
