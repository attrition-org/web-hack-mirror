Be Dead Today</FONT></H2>

<P><B>I am a 14-year-old boy involved sexually with an older guy I happen
to love very much. I am sick and tired of listening to all these stories
of boy-lovers and how perverted and sick they are. Well, if it wasn't for
my older friend Mark, I would probably be dead by now.</B></P>

<P><B>When I was 11 years old, my parents started to drink real heavy,
and instead of buying food they bought a lot of booze. They were fighting
all the time, and my dad always hit me for not cleaning the house. One
night I was looking at this horror movie on television and I got scared,
so I went over to where he was sitting and said, &quot;Dad, can I sit with
you?&quot; Well he called me a little faggot and then took the belt to
me. He hit me extra hard that night because the belt buckle hit me in the
lip and I had to have 8 stitches. (Dad told the hospital doctor I was in
a fight with another kid.)</B></P>

<P><B>When I turned 12, things really got pretty bad, because my mother
took my little sister and ran away. I was now all alone at home with my
dad. He got fired from his truck-driving job for drinking, and he took
out all his hatred on me. One night I stayed at the local library a little
later finishing my homework, and when I got home my dad was drunk and punched
me in the face and threw me out of the house. I guess a neighbor called
the police because they came and locked him up and took me to a children's
shelter.</B></P>

<P><B>I was only there for a short time, because it was there when I met
Mark, who was my youth case-worker. He was always so nice and gentle with
me. For the first time I was being treated like a human being. Mark asked
me if I would like to spend the Christmas holidays with him, and I jumped
at the opportunity. All during that period, Mark treated me like his son,
taking me to the movies, ice-skating, football games, and watching television
together. The last night together was very sad because Mark explained I
was going to be moved to a special school for boys who didn't have any
parents or relatives.</B></P>

<P><B>Well Mark hugged me that night and I could tell he was crying too.
I told him that night I loved him and wanted to remain with him forever.</B></P>

<P><B>I had to go back to the shelter, but a few weeks later I had to go
to this big court room, and I saw Mark sitting there smiling. The judge
asked me if I would like to live with Mark for good. I was so happy I cried.</B></P>

<P><B>Well, I was now 13 years old, and like most other guys was jerking
off every chance I could. Mark surprised me one night and walked into my
room while I had my penis in my hand. I was scared he would send me back
to the shelter, but instead he smiled and sat down on the bed and talked
to me. He held me tight afterwards and it was the most thrilling experience
of my entire life.</B></P>

<P><B>I know Mark is a boy-lover, but I also know he loves me like a son.
I am now 14, and I have a girl friend, and Mark is very excited for me.
He even gives me spending money to take my girl friend ice-skating and
to the movies.</B></P>

<P><B>Well, Mark gets these Bulletins from the NAMBLA, and he is a member.
I often look at these and other boy-love material, and I get sick when
I read about how some people treat guys who love boys.</B></P>

<P><B>Without guys like Mark, I would probably be dead today, because without
someone to love me -- well, life wouldn't be worth living. I am the luckiest
and happiest kid today because of boy-lovers like Mark.</B></P>

<P><B>No one told me to write this letter, and everything I wrote is the
complete truth. Maybe others can learn from my experience that boy-lovers
are indeed the real men of our society. Thank you for reading this, and
you can print it, if you like.</B></P>

<P><B>A very proud 14 year old</B></P>
