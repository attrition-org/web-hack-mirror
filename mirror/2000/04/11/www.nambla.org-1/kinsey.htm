<TD><B>&quot;It is ordinarily said that criminal law is designed to protect
property and to protect persons, and if society's only interest in controlling
sex behavior were to protect persons, then the criminal codes concerned
with assault and battery should provide adequate protection. The fact that
there is a body of sex laws which is apart from the laws protecting persons
is evidence of their distinct function, namely that of protecting custom.&quot;</B>

<P><B>&quot;When children are constantly warned by parents and teachers
against contacts with adults, and when they receive no explanation of the
exact nature of the contacts, they are ready to become hysterical as soon
as any older person approaches, or stops and speaks to them in the street,
or fondles them, or proposes to do something for them, even though the
adult may have had no sexual objective in mind. Some of the more experienced
students of juvenile problems have come to believe that the emotional reactions
of the parents, police officers, and other adults who discover that the
child has had such a contact, may disturb the child more seriously than
the sexual contacts themselves. The current hysteria over sex offenders
may very well have serious effects on the ability of many of these children
to work out sexual adjustments some years later...&quot;</B></P>
