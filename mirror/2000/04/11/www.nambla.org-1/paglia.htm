days, especially in America, boy-love is not only scandalous and criminal,
but somehow in bad taste. On the evening news, one sees handcuffed teachers,
priests and Boy Scout leaders hustled into police vans. Therapists call
them maladjusted, emotionally immature. But beauty has its own laws, inconsistent
with Christian morality. As a woman, I feel free to protest that men today
are pilloried for something that was rational and honorable in Greece at
the height of its civilization.</B><BR>
