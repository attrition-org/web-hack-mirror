<P><B>I am 16 years old and come from a broken home, where my father left
when I was 10 years old. When I turned 12, I started hanging around Times
Square and 42nd Street in New York City, because most of the guys would
hang around there to pick up older gay guys. Most of the time I didn't
have any trouble finding older guys who wanted to have sex with me. Pretty
soon, though, the police got to know me, and would send me to this Detention
Center, but I would always wind up back on Times Square.</B></P>

<P><B>One night two older businessmen picked me up and took me to this
motel. At first they acted real nice to me, but later in the motel they
made me do all kinds of things to them, and I started to really get scared
to death. After I let them use me, they put a cigarette to my rear end,
and it hurt pretty bad. While one guy was doing this the other raped me,
and then they dropped me off near Central Park without giving me a single
dime. I knew my mother would kill me if I went home, so I went back to
Times Square because I didn't have anywhere else to go. I was crying when
this minister came up to me and asked me what was wrong, so I told him
everything and he took me to his pad, where he gave me a bath and put some
medicine on my behind. After he gave me some food, I asked him what I had
to do in return, and he said not a thing. I guess he was the first person
who really took an interest in me.</B></P>

<P><B>I stayed with him for nearly two years, and although he was a minister
I knew he loved younger boys, because he told me one night. I finally got
my mother's permission to live with him, and he made me promise never to
hang around Times Square again. For the first time in my life I felt wanted,
and he treated me like his real son. Sometimes we would just watch television
together and do nothing but hug each other and kiss. Today I am sixteen
and have a girlfriend, and he is extremely happy for me.</B></P>

<P><B>We have sex with each other, but he never forces himself upon me.
I guess you could say I love him more than a father because he taught me
nothing is dirty or wrong when it comes to sex with someone you really
love.</B></P>

<P><B>I am sick and tired of listening to people putting down guys who
love young boys. Sure, I know what a boy-lover is, but I also know that
he is the most gentle person in the whole wide world, and I can always
go to him with all my problems and he listens and helps. I found out early
that most guys who hurt young boys are not boy-lovers.</B><BR>
