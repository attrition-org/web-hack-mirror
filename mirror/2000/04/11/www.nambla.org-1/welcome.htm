<P><B>WELCOME! &nbsp;The North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA)
was formed in 1978. It was inspired by the success of a campaign based
in Boston's gay community to defend against a local witchhunt. &nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>NAMBLA's goal is to end the extreme oppression of men and boys in
mutually consensual relationships by: </B></P>

<UL>
<LI><B>building understanding and support for such relationships; </B></LI>

<LI><B>educating the general public on the benevolent nature of man/boy
love; </B></LI>

<LI><B>cooperating with lesbian, gay, feminist, and other liberation movements;
</B></LI>

<LI><B>supporting the liberation of persons of all ages from sexual prejudice
and oppression. </B></LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Our membership is open to everyone sympathetic to man/boy love and
personal freedom. </B></P>

<P><B>NAMBLA calls for the empowerment of youth in all areas, not just
the sexual. We support greater economic, political and social opportunities
for young people and denounce the rampant <A HREF="alhonte.htm">ageism</A>
that segregates and isolates them in fear and mistrust. We believe sexual
feelings are a positive life force. We support the rights of youth as well
as adults to choose the partners with whom they wish to share and enjoy
their bodies. </B></P>

<P><B>We condemn sexual abuse and all forms of coercion. Freely-chosen
relationships differ from unwanted sex. Present laws, which focus only
on the age of the participants, ignore the quality of their relationships.
We know that differences in age do not preclude mutual, loving interaction
between persons. NAMBLA is strongly opposed to age-of-consent laws and
all other restrictions which deny men and boys the full enjoyment of their
bodies and control over their own lives. </B></P>

<P><B>NAMBLA does not provide encouragement, referrals or assistance for
people seeking sexual contacts. NAMBLA does not engage in any activities
that violate the law. </B></P>

<P><B>We call for fundamental reform of the laws regarding relations between
youths and adults. Today, many thousands of men and boys are unjustly ground
into the disfunctional criminal justice system. Blindly, this system condemns
consensual, loving relationships between younger and older people. NAMBLA's
Prisoner Program, with limited resources, works to provide a modicum of
humanity to some of these people. <A HREF="prisoner.htm">Click here</A>

<P><B>NAMBLA is a political, civil rights, and educational organization.
We provide factual information and help educate society about the positive
and beneficial nature of man/boy love.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A HREF="join.htm">Become
