<P><FONT COLOR="#804040">BOSTON, Dec. 31 - <B>Four years ago this month,
after two dozen men were indicted for sex crimes in the nearby town of
Revere, a conference was held downtown at the Community Church of Boston.
About 30 men [and boys] stayed on to talk of the difficult issue discussed
at the conference, and they decided to form an organization to promote
understanding of their kind of love and to seek a change in the law. Thus,
in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, where many of the laws on sexual
conduct date from the Puritan period, was born the most provocative name
of any homosexual organization in the United States: the North American
Man-Boy Love Association, dedicated to the proposition that state laws
establishing a sexual age of consent should be repealed. </B>...</FONT></P>
