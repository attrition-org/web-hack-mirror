<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040">&quot;Adult males in modern society who feel
fulfilled in giving concern and tuition to boys and youths are portrayed
as being interested only in boys' bodies (though this may be a small part
of the attraction) and are spurned and traduced as sexual monsters. I believe
we reap the harvest of our hysterical fear and homophobia today in juvenile
crime, drug use and delinquency. Consider the ethical training which boys
and youths gainded through <I>shudo</I> in Japan or in the system in classical
Greece, the tuition in manners, customs and humanity, the degree of civilised
values imparted to them, the ideas of loyalty, honour and truthfulness;
this highly personalised education with love and sensuality at its center
must be far more effective than any other. We in the West are bigoted fools
to dismiss it with such horror.&quot; </FONT></B></P>
