<P><B>I'm a 14-year-old boy who would like to speak out in favor of man-boy
relationships. Like most poor-income families from the Philadelphia area,
I started to hustle for spending money when I was 12 years old. Most of
the kids were doing it, and they could make an easy $20 or $30 during the
weekend.</B></P>

<P><B>Most of the time I would just hang around the big Art Museum until
I noticed a guy looking at me. Most of the men who picked me up just wanted
to have oral sex with me, or maybe have me lay on top of them. As soon
as they were finished, they couldn't wait to ditch me. It was so damn cold
and impersonal. My home life was terrible, as my stepmother didn't really
care if I came home or not. One night I went with this guy who raped me
pretty bad. He made me bleed something awful. He refused to give me a dime,
and said he had taught me a lesson.</B></P>

<P><B>I was sitting outside the Franklin Institute that night, still bleeding
and scared to death, when this man about 30 years old came up to me and
asked if anything was wrong. I just started to cry, and couldn't stop.
He was talking very gentle to me, and he asked me right out if some crazy
person tried to hurt me. Well, I guess I needed a friend because I told
him everything. He drove me to his beautiful house in New Jersey, and he
gave me a bath and put something inside to stop the bleeding. At first
I thought he was giving me a bath so he could have sex with me, but he
never tried once to grab me or anything like that. I finally asked him
if he liked to have sex with boys, and he smiled and said, &quot;Yes, but
we won't talk about that now.&quot;</B><BR>
</P>

<P><B>A week later I was back at his house watching television and playing
darts down in his cellar. That night I stayed all night with him, and I
felt so secure to have his arms around me. Yes we had sex together, and
it was beautiful. Here I am, two years later, with a much better outlook
on life, back in school, a part-time job, and someone who loves me deeply.</B><BR>
</P>

<P><B>It seems to me the so-called child molesters and criminals against
young boys are the men society calls heterosexuals, like the married guy
who raped me. Fortunately for me, I was one of the lucky ones who was saved
from the criminal element (Normal Men).<BR>
Thank God for boy-lovers. I hope you print this.</B><BR>
