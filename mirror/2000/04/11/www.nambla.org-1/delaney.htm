<P><IMG SRC="delany.jpg" HEIGHT=200 WIDTH=145 ALIGN=LEFT><B>&quot;I read
the <I>NAMBLA [Bulletin]</I> fairly regularly and I think it is one of
the most intelligent discussions of sexuality I've ever found. &nbsp;I
think before you start judging what NAMBLA is about, expose yourself to
it and see what it is really about. &nbsp;What the issues they are really
talking about, and deal with what's really there rather than this demonized
notion of guys running about trying to screw little boys. &nbsp;I would
have been so much happier as an adolescent if NAMBLA had been around when
I was 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</B></P>
