<br>
<font face="arial" size="-1"><font face="arial, helvetica, geneva" size="-1">Few organizations take advantage of the entire spectrum of political resources available to them, but with Democracy Data &amp; Communications, you can.  For grassroots and lobbying programs with more complex database requirements, Democracy Data &amp; Communications' online database management offers the convenience, adaptability, and ease of use you need to maximize your grassroots assets.  <br>
<br>

Like an in-house database, our client/server software&#151;Democracy Direct<sup>TM</sup>&#151;enables clients to view and use their data any time, day or night.  But as an outsourcing solution, it still gives you all the benefits of expert, specialized technical support.  Additionally, the database itself becomes significantly more robust and flexible&#151;you can store and correlate more detailed information, demonstrate previously unrecognized relationships among your assets, and manipulate your data for any campaign, meeting, or program you need to implement.</font><br><br>

<b>Determining Your Needs and Objectives</b><br>

The design and objectives of your government affairs efforts determine how your database needs to work.  Because we are experienced in both technology and politics, we are able to work closely with you from the start to thoroughly evaluate the assets you have and how they can best help you achieve your goals.
