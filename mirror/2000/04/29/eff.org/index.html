More information:

Attrition.org received the following e-mail from a Webmaster at the EFF.
He makes some interesting and valid points at how the EFF appeared
to be a random target with the defacers having little
or no knowledge that the site belonged to an organization that
may even be their allies. 
-------------------------------------
I'm hoping you'll post [the mirror], just to shame the bugger(s) who did it.
They should know better that to shoot at their own allies. Also just
for the record (and unlike our previous defacer, who simply moved our
index.html to index.html.bak and added a new one-liner), soulstice
(presumably with help from those [s]he's credited) has done extensive
and probably irreparable damage to the system.  (S)he/they is/are
extremely malicious.  It's looking like we're just going to have to
wipe the drives, install and compile everything from scratch, and
restore user data files from tape at this point.  The system won't even
boot except off the CD.  Fortunately this was just our staging server,
Web-wise, but unfortunately it's also our sole mail server, and
restoration of mail at eff.org is going to take a while.

I am hopeful that some reputational damage may straighten out dwids like this.
