This is the NewsPro archive file template. This will be used to generate all your monthly archive
files. It should be a basic HTML page, except you may insert the following special commands anywhere
in this file:
<Insert!Date> Inserts the month of the archive.
<Insert!News> Inserts the archived news (pretty useless if you don't include this).
IMPORTANT: The ! in the example above was inserted so that the example wouldn't be confused by
the script with the actual command. Remove the exclamation marks from the example when using
those commands.

Here is the juice:<br><br><br><br>Tustin, CA.  --  October 11, 1999 --  Building upon the success of their first joint venture with Civilization: Call to Power, Activision, Inc. and Loki Entertainment Software today announce they have joined forces to bring more PC and Macintosh games to the Linux platform.<br><br><br>Loki Entertainment Software launched the Linux version of Activision¼s popular strategy game Civilization: Call to Power in May, 1999, to strong reviews. Under the terms of the new agreement, Loki will develop, publish and support the Linux ports of five popular Activision games, including Heretic II and Heavy Gear II, over the next two years. The agreement solidifies Activision¼s commitment to the ever-growing Linux software community, and positions Loki as the foremost authority on commercial Linux games.<br><br><br>"Activision is committed to providing Linux users with quality gaming experiences," states Philippe Erwin, director of licensing for Activision.  "By extending our partnership with Loki and offering popular games like Heavy Gear II and Heretic II, we will enhance the level of quality entertainment that Linux users have available to them and contribute to the growth of the platform."<br><br><br>"We are excited to work with Activision to continually provide exciting and high-quality games for the Linux community," said Scott Draeker, Loki founder and president. "Earlier this year, people wondered if there was a market for commercial games on Linux. We have put those doubts to rest, and will now focus on expanding the gaming universe for Linux users."<br><br><br>This universe will soon include Heavy Gear II, a combat-simulation game, and Heretic II, a breath-taking third-person action game.<br><br><br>Heavy Gear II, released for Windows in June, 1999, features a state-of-the-art 3D hardware-only engine, and delivers fast-paced solo and multi-player squad combat action, photo-realistic graphics and richly-detailed battlefields. Gamers take command of an elite strike force that operates deep behind enemy lines, and leads special operations through more than 80 death-defying missions. As they attempt to undermine the opposition, players can send orders to squad-mates and use real squad battle strategies like flanking maneuvers and diversionary tactics to <br>ambush enemies.<br><br><br>Heretic II, the next Activision title on the Loki lineup, transports players to a richly animated medieval land that has been ravaged by an evil plague. Gamers embark on an epic journey across an enemy-infested continent in search of a magical cure. Heretic II combines the control and fast-paced action of a first-person shooter game with an over-the-should third-person perspective, a combination that fully immerses gamers into their character¼s experiences. Featuring 22 thrilling single-player environments and five intense deathmatch levels, Heretic II challenges players to overcome the insidious plague by solving puzzles and gathering clues.</font></p>
