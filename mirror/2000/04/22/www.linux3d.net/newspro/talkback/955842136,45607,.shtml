It is not fun working like a I dog, I tell you.<br><br>Anyway, what largely kept me from updating, along with a very busy fulltime job reviewing hardware, is the following:<br><br><a href="http://dcypher.net">DCypher.Net</a> and <a href="http://www.processtree.com">ProcessTree Network</a>, both distributed computing efforts, merged April 12. DCypher.Net is doing feeless projects and makes money from advertising while ProcessTree is going to offer fee-based computing and plans to pay participants directly.<br><br>If you want to know more, visit the DCypher.Net website. Anyone have an idea why Slashdot only posts distributed computing news that have to do with distributed.net? <br><br>After the fifth rejected posts I start to think that they not only sold out but also lost all kind of reporting ethics. Not much left of stuff that matters, just stuff that matters to ourselves.</font></p>
