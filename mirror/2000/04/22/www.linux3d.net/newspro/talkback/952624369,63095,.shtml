It allows <br>games and other applications to take advantage of powerful spacialized <br>sound effects, including distance and direction attenuation, panning and <br>reverb. With these features, gamers can, for example, determine by sound <br>the distance and direction of an explosion in a 3D-gaming environment.<br><br>"OpenAL represents a milestone for Linux and for the game industry in <br>general," said Scott Draeker, president, Loki Entertainment Software. <br>"Until now, games running on Linux have not had access to the advanced <br>3D-Audio features available on other platforms. OpenAL provides those <br>advanced features with an open-source, nonproprietary implementation <br>which is available not just for Linux, but for Windows and MacOS games as <br>well. What SGI's OpenGL has done for 3D-Video, OpenAL will do for <br>3D-Audio."<br><br>Prior to OpenAL, there was no standard way to implement 3D-Audio for <br>Linux. Because the proprietary audio libraries for Mac and Windows are <br>not compatible with Linux, Loki decided to create an audio API that would <br>be both cross-platform and open-source. Loki drew upon the previous <br>efforts of members of the open-source community and teamed with hardware <br>vendors such as Creative Technology Ltd. (NASDAQ: CREAF) to make the <br>project a reality.<br><br>Creative Technology, the leader in providing advanced PC audio hardware, <br>plans to release Linux drivers that will work with OpenAL, and which <br>natively support the advanced 3D-Audio effects which OpenAL enables. In <br>addition, Creative is evaluating MacOS and Windows implementations of the <br>OpenAL standard<br><br>"Creative is excited to be a part of the OpenAL creation and authoring <br>committee", said Jacob Hawley, Director of the Custom Engineering <br>division at Creative. "This API will help content developers provide <br>robust applications on Linux and other leading platforms, opening new <br>markets for hardware vendors such as Creative in the process. This API is <br>a win / win for everyone."<br><br>"OpenAL is another major step forward for Linux and shows how complete a <br>gaming platform Linux has become," said Dr. Michael Cowpland, President <br>and CEO of Corel Corporation. "Corel has long been a supporter of open <br>standards and cross-platform compatibility. We are thrilled with the <br>progress by Loki and Creative Labs and we look forward to including more <br>of their technology in our future releases."<br><br>Loki is already incorporating OpenAL into it's growing product line of <br>AAA Linux games. In March, Loki will release the Linux version of <br>Activision's Heavy Gear II, the first Linux game to support 3D-Audio <br>using OpenAL.<br><br>The source code for OpenAL for Mac, Windows and Linux is freely available <br>for download and is offered under the GNU Library Public License (LGPL). <br>Visit www.openal.org for more information. </font></p>
