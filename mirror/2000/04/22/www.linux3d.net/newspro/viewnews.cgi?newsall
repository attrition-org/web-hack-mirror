It allows <br>games and other applications to take advantage of powerful spacialized <br>sound effects, including distance and direction attenuation, panning and <br>reverb. With these features, gamers can, for example, determine by sound <br>the distance and direction of an explosion in a 3D-gaming environment.<br><br>"OpenAL represents a milestone for Linux and for the game industry in <br>general," said Scott Draeker, president, Loki Entertainment Software. <br>"Until now, games running on Linux have not had access to the advanced <br>3D-Audio features available on other platforms. OpenAL provides those <br>advanced features with an open-source, nonproprietary implementation <br>which is available not just for Linux, but for Windows and MacOS games as <br>well. What SGI's OpenGL has done for 3D-Video, OpenAL will do for <br>3D-Audio."<br><br>Prior to OpenAL, there was no standard way to implement 3D-Audio for <br>Linux. Because the proprietary audio libraries for Mac and Windows are <br>not compatible with Linux, Loki decided to create an audio API that would <br>be both cross-platform and open-source. Loki drew upon the previous <br>efforts of members of the open-source community and teamed with hardware <br>vendors such as Creative Technology Ltd. (NASDAQ: CREAF) to make the <br>project a reality.<br><br>Creative Technology, the leader in providing advanced PC audio hardware, <br>plans to release Linux drivers that will work with OpenAL, and which <br>natively support the advanced 3D-Audio effects which OpenAL enables. In <br>addition, Creative is evaluating MacOS and Windows implementations of the <br>OpenAL standard<br><br>"Creative is excited to be a part of the OpenAL creation and authoring <br>committee", said Jacob Hawley, Director of the Custom Engineering <br>division at Creative. "This API will help content developers provide <br>robust applications on Linux and other leading platforms, opening new <br>markets for hardware vendors such as Creative in the process. This API is <br>a win / win for everyone."<br><br>"OpenAL is another major step forward for Linux and shows how complete a <br>gaming platform Linux has become," said Dr. Michael Cowpland, President <br>and CEO of Corel Corporation. "Corel has long been a supporter of open <br>standards and cross-platform compatibility. We are thrilled with the <br>progress by Loki and Creative Labs and we look forward to including more <br>of their technology in our future releases."<br><br>Loki is already incorporating OpenAL into it's growing product line of <br>AAA Linux games. In March, Loki will release the Linux version of <br>Activision's Heavy Gear II, the first Linux game to support 3D-Audio <br>using OpenAL.<br><br>The source code for OpenAL for Mac, Windows and Linux is freely available <br>for download and is offered under the GNU Library Public License (LGPL). <br>Visit www.openal.org for more information. </font></p>

The alpha VSA-100 product we showed at Cebit had a few problems that were caused by a faulty process in the manufacturing of the silicon.  The processing flaw manifested itself in many areas, including issues with clock frequencies and RAMDAC quality.  The problem has been rectified.<br><br>3dfx is very encouraged by the state of our first silicon, known as A0 silicon, which was used on the products shown at Cebit.  It is not unusual for first silicon to have a few minor issues. The excellent state of this initial silicon is very encouraging, and none of the minor problems that have been discovered and address have delayed the shipments of the Voodoo4 and Voodoo5 products. <br><br>We have placed orders for production silicon already.  Our software development is right on track.  We are on the same release schedule as when the VSA-100 product was introduced at Comdex, which we stated would be in the Spring.  That product will include all the features that have been promised.  It will deliver real time, full scene anti aliasing.  It will support dazzling cinematic effects via our t-buffer.  It will feature 32-bit color depth, SLI implementations and astronomical fill rates.   Despite the outstanding state of this first silicon, the boards used in the Cebit demonstrations do not represent production silicon.  Shortly after GDC, we expect to be demonstrating Voodoo4 and Voodoo5 boards that are much closer to production quality.<br><br>BB<br>PR Manager<br>3dfx, Inc. <br><br></font></p>

So without any further delays please read on: <br><br><I>Previously, the Linux build of Quake 3 did not include the Rage Pro<br>workarounds such as the special translucent smoke texture and other<br>approximations.

I fired off<br>an email to Zoid yesterday asking if these workarounds could be included in<br>the current point release, and sure enought the 1.16j patch enables these<br>fixes.<br><br>So, those of you with all forms of ATI Rage Pro chips (including the laptop<br>chipsets such as the Rage Pro LT and Mobility) can now play Quake 3 under<br>Linux without having to suffer from opaque smoke trails and other visual<br>artifacts.  And yes, the <a href="http://utah-glx.sourceforge.net">Utah-GLX</a> driver will give you timedemo scores that<br>are as good as or better than the current Windows drivers.<br><br>Thanks to Carmack, Zoid and Robert Duffy for resolving this problem so<br>quickly.<br><br>-- Gareth</I> </font></p>

I wanted to post an update on how that's going. We've had the "port" done for quite a while now and it's been tested and works just great. The only problem is that, since we're a commercial add-on, we need to put WON net support into the Linux dedicated server. This is turning out to be a harder to deal with issue than I originally anticipated. Some changes to the WON libraries since we released Opposing Force, plus the basic differences between the Windows and Linux versions have been delaying the Linux dedicated server.<br>I'm still working on the Linux version when I can and I would like to get it released ASAP, but unfortunately I have to resolve these WON issues before I can get any farther.<br>On the brighter side of things, it looks like Sierra has dropped the price of Opposing Force.

Under the terms of the new agreement, Loki will develop, publish and support the Linux ports of five popular Activision games, including Heretic II and Heavy Gear II, over the next two years. The agreement solidifies Activision¼s commitment to the ever-growing Linux software community, and positions Loki as the foremost authority on commercial Linux games.<br><br><br>"Activision is committed to providing Linux users with quality gaming experiences," states Philippe Erwin, director of licensing for Activision.  "By extending our partnership with Loki and offering popular games like Heavy Gear II and Heretic II, we will enhance the level of quality entertainment that Linux users have available to them and contribute to the growth of the platform."<br><br><br>"We are excited to work with Activision to continually provide exciting and high-quality games for the Linux community," said Scott Draeker, Loki founder and president. "Earlier this year, people wondered if there was a market for commercial games on Linux. We have put those doubts to rest, and will now focus on expanding the gaming universe for Linux users."<br><br><br>This universe will soon include Heavy Gear II, a combat-simulation game, and Heretic II, a breath-taking third-person action game.<br><br><br>Heavy Gear II, released for Windows in June, 1999, features a state-of-the-art 3D hardware-only engine, and delivers fast-paced solo and multi-player squad combat action, photo-realistic graphics and richly-detailed battlefields. Gamers take command of an elite strike force that operates deep behind enemy lines, and leads special operations through more than 80 death-defying missions. As they attempt to undermine the opposition, players can send orders to squad-mates and use real squad battle strategies like flanking maneuvers and diversionary tactics to <br>ambush enemies.<br><br><br>Heretic II, the next Activision title on the Loki lineup, transports players to a richly animated medieval land that has been ravaged by an evil plague. Gamers embark on an epic journey across an enemy-infested continent in search of a magical cure. Heretic II combines the control and fast-paced action of a first-person shooter game with an over-the-should third-person perspective, a combination that fully immerses gamers into their character¼s experiences. Featuring 22 thrilling single-player environments and five intense deathmatch levels, Heretic II challenges players to overcome the insidious plague by solving puzzles and gathering clues.</font></p>

I will definately need to do something about circulation, though, the CPUs are in a bad position behind the power supply and drive bay cables where they have trouble getting cool outside air. Luckily the case allows for removal of the top so that's what I'm doing for now, with the intent to add two 50 mm fans into that top once I get my hands on suitable power tools and the money for the parts.Thanks go to Shane Jordan for pointing my nose in the right direction on the networking stuff, I got it to talk to the internet through the ISDN dialup machine that way.</font></p>

Even if you dont care about Tribes, please sign the petition, the more ports the better. I believe we are being held back majorly however when it comes to 3d rendering until we see the release of xfree 4 w/ its new direct rendering(nvidia seems to think so also, and probably game authors too). If you have any thoughts on this please <a href="mailto:dropn@linux3d.net">mail me.</a></font></p>
