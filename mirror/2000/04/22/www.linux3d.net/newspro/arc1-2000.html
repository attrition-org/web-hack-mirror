<Insert!Date> Inserts the month of the archive.
<Insert!News> Inserts the archived news (pretty useless if you don't include this).

Here it is:<br><br>Following the showing of the VSA-100 based products at Cebit, there have been a lot of questions about the status of the Voodoo4 and Voodoo5 boards. The alpha VSA-100 product we showed at Cebit had a few problems that were caused by a faulty process in the manufacturing of the silicon.  The processing flaw manifested itself in many areas, including issues with clock frequencies and RAMDAC quality.  The problem has been rectified.<br><br>3dfx is very encouraged by the state of our first silicon, known as A0 silicon, which was used on the products shown at Cebit.  It is not unusual for first silicon to have a few minor issues. The excellent state of this initial silicon is very encouraging, and none of the minor problems that have been discovered and address have delayed the shipments of the Voodoo4 and Voodoo5 products. <br><br>We have placed orders for production silicon already.  Our software development is right on track.  We are on the same release schedule as when the VSA-100 product was introduced at Comdex, which we stated would be in the Spring.  That product will include all the features that have been promised.  It will deliver real time, full scene anti aliasing.  It will support dazzling cinematic effects via our t-buffer.  It will feature 32-bit color depth, SLI implementations and astronomical fill rates.   Despite the outstanding state of this first silicon, the boards used in the Cebit demonstrations do not represent production silicon.  Shortly after GDC, we expect to be demonstrating Voodoo4 and Voodoo5 boards that are much closer to production quality.<br><br>BB<br>PR Manager<br>3dfx, Inc. <br><br></font></p>

I fired off<br>an email to Zoid yesterday asking if these workarounds could be included in<br>the current point release, and sure enought the 1.16j patch enables these<br>fixes.<br><br>So, those of you with all forms of ATI Rage Pro chips (including the laptop<br>chipsets such as the Rage Pro LT and Mobility) can now play Quake 3 under<br>Linux without having to suffer from opaque smoke trails and other visual<br>artifacts.  And yes, the <a href="http://utah-glx.sourceforge.net">Utah-GLX</a> driver will give you timedemo scores that<br>are as good as or better than the current Windows drivers.<br><br>Thanks to Carmack, Zoid and Robert Duffy for resolving this problem so<br>quickly.<br><br>-- Gareth</I> </font></p>

Here is a little extract of the PR:<br><br><br>(...)This announcement also confirms ATI's pursuit to become the Linux community's Number One graphics vendor. It builds on the company's earlier announcement of official support for the Linux OS, and release of development information for ATI's products.

Initiatives are underway for Linux development in ATI's set-top products. (...)``ATI is committed to the advancement of Linux, and offering high quality video playback is the next major step forward,'' said Henry Quan, vice president of corporate marketing, ATI. ``We are enabling the Linux community to take advantage of our industry-leading video playback technology, which is the key missing link in developing full multimedia support for ATI.(...)<br><br>You can read the entire PR <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/000221/ati_suppor_1.html">here.</a><br><br>P.S.: I am working on the ATI section here on L3D.
