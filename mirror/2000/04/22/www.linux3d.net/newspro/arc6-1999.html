I am now waiting only for the ABit BP6 board that I plan to review anymore, the rest is in place. Got myself two 366 MHz PPGA Celerons with the default coolers (to be replaced with TennMax coolers later on) and 128 MB PC100 RAM. <br><br>The box is a pretty lame midi-tower which may need some help with the breathing once I go into overclocking, for mass storage I have an IDE 36X CD ROM and an old SCSI setup I ripped out of my former 486 box, three harddisks of 1.8 GB total, a 240 as swap drive, a 540 that will house a NT system for comparision testing and a 1080, all three hooked up to an ancient ISA Adaptec 1522. <br><br>So don't expect any great disk benchmarks from that rig but it is good enough to keep the machine networked with one of the two big guys I'll have here sometime next week, my trusted K6-III/400 and an Athlon 600 that you'll also get to see some Linux scores from once the NDA expires, each running more than 14 GB in disk space. </font></p>

They may, under this Term of Services, use your stuff to their monetary gain, give it to other people as they see fit etc.<br><br>This of course if nothing any sane mind can tolerate. Hence some people called into life a <a href="http://www.sitepowerup.com/boycottyahoo/boycottyahoo.htm">Boycott Yahoo!</a> Campaign.<br><br>As a creator of original content on the web I encourage you to participate in this and force Yahoo! to surrender that clause unconditionally and apologize for this brazen attempt of theft. Don't use their search engine anymore, stop using their Yahoo! email service and take your site from GeoCities to a different free provider - and make sure to wipe the account clean. </font></p>
