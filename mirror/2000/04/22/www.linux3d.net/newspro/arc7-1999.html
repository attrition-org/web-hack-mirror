These are supposed to do duty in the SMP machine, which under the default coolers got to a maximum speed of 483 MHz.<br><br><img src="../images/news/IMAGE016.jpg" align="center"><br><br>Unfortunately it seems that this coincides with the max speed of the lesser quality CPU of the two, while I was able to get a stable 550 MHz out of the other one (under the MEGA7). Since it is hardly tolerable that I'd restrain a 550 MHz CPU to 483 MHz because the other guy in the team has no balls I decided to buy a third Celeron 366 PPGA that I hope will match the 550 as well (so yes, that means you can buy the 366 that does 483 if you want and live in Germany so I can send it to you - asking price 150 Marks + S&H).<br><br>As soon as the bloody mary runs at full throttle I'll do a review of the system (BP6 motherboard in particular, with which I am positively impressed already).</font></p>

I will definately need to do something about circulation, though, the CPUs are in a bad position behind the power supply and drive bay cables where they have trouble getting cool outside air. Luckily the case allows for removal of the top so that's what I'm doing for now, with the intent to add two 50 mm fans into that top once I get my hands on suitable power tools and the money for the parts.Thanks go to Shane Jordan for pointing my nose in the right direction on the networking stuff, I got it to talk to the internet through the ISDN dialup machine that way.</font></p>
