        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">This is the Linux version of the test. The Win32
        versions will be released separately at a later date.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Before proceeding onward, please read the
        README.EULA file. This is the End User License Agreement. It's the agreement between you
        and id regarding this test. Read it. Understand that the acts of loading or running the
        software, or placing it on your computer hard drive, RAM, or other storage, you are
        agreeing to be bound by the terms of the End User License Agreement. So it's best to know
        what you are agreeing to.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><br>
        +----------------+<br>
        | THIS IS A TEST |<br>
        +----------------+<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">We want to set the record straight from the
        outset. This is neither a demo nor an ALPHA version of the final game and should not be
        expected to behave as such. Q3Test is a test of Quake3: Arena's network technology and
        graphics compatibility. While many of the game features that you will see in this test are
        in a highly polished state, do not confuse this with being anything other than what it is
        intended to be: a test. By running this test openly on the Internet and on a multitude of
        local networks, we hope to expose problems that could not otherwise be discovered on the
        limited number of in-house systems and computer. That's why we need your assistance for
        this test.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Furthermore, it is anticipated that there may be
        revisions and additions made to the test that will make it incompatible with earlier
        versions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><br>
        +---------------------+<br>
        | SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS |<br>
        +---------------------+<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">There is no software-only version of the game.
        If your computer is not hardware accelerated with a game compatible graphics card, you
        will NOT be able to run Q3Test. Currently, 3DFX based cards are the only tested compatible
        cards. If your computer does not meet the minimum requirements, you are unlikely to be
        able to run a satisfactory game experience. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">A glibc compatible Linux installation is
        required. An easy to determine if you have glibc support is to type this:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">ls -l /lib/libc* </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">If you get a report of libc6 (you may also have
        libc5), you have a glibc based system.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The Linux version requires a supported hardware
        3D acceleration card. The following are currently supported:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">o 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics based cards<br>
          o 3Dfx Voodoo2 based cards<br>
          </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Other cards of similar make and model may work,
        but are not supported. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Other X11 OpenGL libraries may work with a
        supported hardware accelerator, but have not been extensively tested. Performance on
        untested OpenGL configurations may not produce acceptable game speed. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">For 3Dfx based products, Linux Q3Test is
        distributed with a version of Mesa 3-D specifically compiled for Voodoo support. You must
        have 3Dfx Linux Glide drivers installed however. These drivers are available from: </font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <a href="http://glide.xxedgexx.com/3DfxRPMS.html"><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"
          size="2">http://glide.xxedgexx.com/3DfxRPMS.html</a> </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Make sure that you download and install the
        glibc versions of the drivers (found at the bottom of the page).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Mirrors for this site are can be found at: </font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <a href="http://glide.mirrors.sonic.net"><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">http://glide.mirrors.sonic.net</a><br>
          <a href="http://glide.samiam.org">http://glide.samiam.org</a><br>
          </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Please follow the installation instructions
        presented there for adding the correct drivers for your 3D-acceleration card. Note that
        there are two ways to install the 3DFX drivers-one with support for a /dev/3dfx device
        that does not require root permissions in order to use the card. If you choose to not use
        the /dev/3dfx method, you will have to run Q3Test as the root user. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">NOTE: Linux Q3Test will try to load
        &quot;libGL.so&quot; before using 3Dfx drivers. This can cause problems if you have a
        software or third party OpenGL driver installed. You can specifically target the included
        3Dfx based Mesa driver by using the following command line: </font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">./linuxquake3 +set r_glDriver

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Linux Q3Test requires X11 to run. There is no
        console-based version as in previous id products such as GLQuake and Quake2. XFree86
        version 3.2 or later is required. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">There are two ways that mouse input is handled
        under XFree86:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">o By default, Q3Test will attempt to use DGA
          mouse handling. DGA support features direct reading of the mouse motion and provides more
          accurate control while playing the game. By default this support is enabled, but can be
          disabled by adding &quot;+set in_dgamouse 0&quot; to the command line at startup.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">o The non-DGA method of mouse input uses pointer
          grabbing and warps the pointer to the middle of the window on each mouse update. On
          systems with a slow frame rate and a lot of mouse user input, the motion can get
          &quot;clipped&quot; to the window boundaries. This method of input is more compatible
          however.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Q3Test uses the XFree86 VidModeExtension
        facilities if available to provide fullscreen play. This does not apply to 3Dfx
        passthrough based cards, since the passthrough cable takes over the video display upon
        activation anyway. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">When configuring your X11 server, make sure that
        you include lower resolution modes such as 640x480 and 800x600. Q3Test will auto-switch to
        these modes using the VidModeExtension if you select fullscreen from the graphics options
        menu. If the lower resolution modes are not listed in the XFree86 configuration file,
        Q3Test will be unable to switch to the desired resolution for fullscreen play. </font></p>

        +-------------------------+<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Q3Test uses the /dev/dsp sound device for sound
        support under Linux. This is the default device provided by the sound drivers included
        with the Linux kernel. Please note that at the time of this writing, PCI based sound cards
        such as the SoundBlaster Live and Diamond Monster MX series were not supported. They may
        be supported in the future. Check http://www.opensound.com/ for support in the future. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">If you do not run Q3Test as root (recommended),
        you may need to make sure the permissions for the /dev/dsp device are read and write by
        the user running Q3Test. The cheap and easy way to make this happen is to do &quot;chmod
        o+rw /dev/dsp&quot; as root. For the more security conscious, a special sound group could
        be created and Q3Test could be made setgid to the sound group to access the device. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Q3Test uses mmap() to map the sound buffers on
        /dev/dsp directly in order to provide responsive sound needs. Sound cards must be able to
        support this feature in order to work. SoundBlaster 16, AWE32 and AWE64 cards are known to
        work. </font></p>

        == INSTALLING Q3TEST ==<br>
        ========================<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">After you have installed the needed hardware
        drivers for your 3D acceleration and sound hardware, you need to install the Q3Test
        package. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Q3Test is available as a Red Hat RPM file or as
        a tar file. To install the RPM file, enter the following when logged in as the root user: <br>
        rpm -Uvh q3test-1.00-glibc-1.i386.rpm <br>
        The rpm installs the game and data files in /usr/local/games/q3test. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">[ Note: If you have not installed (or do not
        wish to install) the Linux glide drivers, you may get an error message about not having
        libglide2x.so installed. This can be ignored and installation can be forced by adding the
        --nodeps option to the rpm command line as follows: <br>
        rpm --nodeps -Uvh q3test-1.00-glibc-1.i386.rpm ] </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">If you are going to install the tar version,
        make a directory for installation, untar the file as follows: <br>
        tar xzvf q3test-1.00-glibc-i386.tar.gz <br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">This will untar the files into a q3test

        == Section 4. ==<br>
        == RUNNING Q3TEST ==<br>
        ====================<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">It is recommended that you do not run Q3Test
        using the root account or with root privileges. There are two exceptions to this: </font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">o If you are using a 3Dfx based accelerator card
          and do not install the /dev/3dfx configuration option. (You will have to run as root in
          order to access the card).</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">o If you do not have access to the /dev/dsp
          device and do not wish to change the mode of the device so that non-root accounts can
          access it.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">You will have to be running under X11 or have
        the DISPLAY variable pointed to a OpenGL glX capable X Server. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">By default, Q3Test tries to find the following
        OpenGL libraries in this order: </font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">o libGL.so.1<br>
          o libMesaVoodooGL.so.3.1<br>
          </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">You can override the library name by entering,
        &quot;+set r_glDriver &lt;libname&gt;&quot; on the command line. This may be needed if you
        are using a non-standard set up and have a different name for the OpenGL shared library. </font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">If everything proceeds successfully, you should
        have a Q3Test window on your desktop with a menu displayed (3DFX owners will get a full
        screen view). If you want to use full screen, go to the System Configuration, Graphics
        Options, Fullscreen, change the value to Yes, and hit enter to apply it. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">If you intend to connect to the Internet to play
        Q3Test, make certain that your net connection is open and working first. </font></p>

        ============================<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">When you start Q3Test, the game does not
        automatically load a map. Instead it displays the Main Menu screen. At this point (or at
        any time during the game) you may adjust and customize the video and audio settings on
        your computer, change details regarding your game character, and if desired, change the
        default controls to ones more to your liking. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">At any time during the game, press the Escape
        key to bring up the Main menu and superimpose it over the game screen. Use the up and down
        arrow keys to navigate the menu, and press the Enter key to select a function. Press
        Escape to return to the main level menu (and set any selected choices). Each Main menu
        function brings up a list of secondary menu items. If you have problems using the
        secondary menu selections, please refer to the message banner at the bottom of the screen
        for technical details. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">If a menu selection appears in gray, you cannot
        select or modify it. Choosing some options in the CONTROL CUSTOMIZATION and GRAPHICS
        OPTIONS menus will disallow other options. This is because they are either unnecessary (as
        is the case with MOUSE LOOK if you select the FREE LOOK option), or are not supported (as
        is the case with COLOR DEPTH if you chose the VOODOO OPENGL). </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The first three Main Menu options, SEARCH FOR
        LAN GAME, CONNECT TO NETWORK GAME and START NETWORK GAME are only available if the player
        is not currently connected to an ongoing game. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">SEARCH FOR LAN GAME:<br>
        If your computer is on a Local Area Network (LAN), this will show any currently active
        Q3Test servers on the network, along with the number of players currently in the game and
        the maximum number of players that can be in that game. <br>
        Example: idserver q3test1 1/8 <br>
        This indicates that the server on the LAN called &quot;idserver&quot; is currently playing
        the map &quot;q3test1&quot; and has one player in it out of the possible 8 that can be in
        the game at one time. <br>
        Use the up/down arrow keys to select a server and hit ENTER to command your computer to
        connect to that game. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">CONNECT TO NETWORK GAME: <br>
        SERVER: If your computer is connected to the Internet, you can enter the IP address of a
        server and hit ENTER to attempt to make a connection to that server. For server id's
        Q3Test server listings, go to http://www.quake3arena.com or check with your favorite 3D
        gaming web sites for other servers. <br>
        <br>
        RATE: Set the type of network connection you are using. Choices are:
        &quot;&lt;=28.8K&quot;, &quot;33.6K&quot;, &quot;56K&quot;, &quot;ISDN&quot;, and
        &quot;LAN/cable/xDSL&quot;. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">START NETWORK GAME:<br>
        To start a network game, whether on a LAN or over the Internet, select this option. The
        secondary menu screen has the following options: <br>
        <br>
        START: Launches the game using the parameters currently set on this menu. <br>
        <br>
        MAP: This gives access to the list of maps located in the Quake3/Baseq3/Maps
        directory/folder. For the purposes of this test, there are only two maps. Use the left and
        right arrow keys to toggle between the two maps. <br>
        <br>
        DEDICATED: This is either &quot;no&quot;, &quot;dedicated LAN,&quot; or &quot;dedicated
        Internet.&quot; A dedicated server (set to YES) runs the game, but does not display a
        graphic version of the game on the screen of the computer running the game. The default
        value for this is no. This means that you are running the server and participating as a
        player at the same time. <br>
        <br>
        TIME LIMIT: entering a non-zero number here sets a time limit (in minutes) for the game
        duration. If the game has not ended because a frag limit has been set, then it will end
        when time runs out. <br>
        <br>
        FRAG LIMIT: Entering a non-zero number here sets the number of &quot;kills&quot; needed to
        win the game. If the game has not ended because a time limit has been set, then it will
        end when one player in the game reaches this number of frags. <br>
        <br>
        MAX PLAYERS: This is the total number of players that may be in the game at any one time.
        HOSTNAME: This is the name of the server. In the LAN example above, the hostname is
        &quot;idserver.&quot; <br>
        <br>
        CUSTOMIZE PLAYER: Allows the player to change information about his in-game persona. <br>
        <br>
        NAME: This is the player's name as it will appear on-screen during the game. It may be up
        to 33 characters long. <br>
        <br>
        SKIN: Visor is the only model in the test. Two skins (red and blue) are available for the
        model. Use the left and right arrow keys to select one. <br>
        <br>
        EFFECTS COLOR: You can choose an identifying color for your rail gun projectile trails.
        Use the left and right arrow keys to select a color. <br>
        <br>
        HANDICAP: Better players can choose to handicap themselves to balance a match against
        players of less skill by limiting the maximum amount of health and armor that they can
        have during the game. Use the left and right arrows to select a value from 25 to 100
        points. Certain items and power ups will temporarily raise this value, but will then count
        down to the preset value. The default is 100. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">CUSTOMIZE CONTROLS:<br>
        Allows the player to change the assignment of game controls to other keyboard and mouse
        buttons. When you visit this menu for the first time, the default assignments for all
        controls are shown. To change an assignment, use the up/down arrow keys to select a game
        function. Press ENTER to activate the change process. Press the keyboard key or mouse
        input that you want to use for that function. Up to two keys/buttons may be assigned to
        each game function in this manner by repeating the process. If you inadvertently use a key
        assigned to another function, three question marks (&quot;???&quot;) appear next to the
        function that previously used that key. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">ALWAYS RUN: setting this to YES causes your
        player to move faster, but make more noise as he moves. The RUN/WALK key allows the player
        to switch between fast/noisy and slow/silent movement modes. <br>
        <br>
        FREELOOK: If YES, then you may look freely in all directions as if you were moving only
        your head by moving the mouse around. If this is Set to NO you must bind a key to mouse
        look. <br>
        <br>
        INVERT MOUSE: Selecting YES inverts the up and down view movement directions. <br>
        <br>
        MOUSE SPEED: This is set on the menu with a slide control. The faster your mouse speed,
        the greater the on-screen response to small movements of the mouse. Mouse speed can also
        be adjusted from the console. Bring the console down and type in &quot;sensitivity&quot;.
        The game will respond by printing &quot;sensitivity&quot; is: &quot;__&quot; (the blank
        indicating the number value currently assigned to mouse speed) default is &quot;5&quot;.
        Use the up arrow key to display sensitivity on the console again, enter a different number
        value and hit enter. Higher numbers are more sensitive. Lower numbers are less sensitive. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">SYSTEM CONFIGURATION:<br>
        EFFECTS VOLUME: Use the slide control to adjust game sound playback volume to your liking.
        <br>
        <br>
        SOUND QUALITY: Select either Low (16 bit sound running at 11 megahertz) or High (32 bit
        sound running at 22 megahertz). <br>
        <br>
        BRIGHTNESS: Use this slide control to compensate for differences in the way some monitors
        and video cards draw the game world. Remember that the arenas are supposed to be dark and
        foreboding places. <br>
        <br>
        GRAPHICS OPTIONS: This drops you down into another menu layer. The controls here are
        designed to help you optimize graphics and or/enhance the game's playability on your
        system. When you are satisfied with your selections, you must move the cursor to the
        bottom of the screen to the APPLY option to activate them. Pressing Escape to return to
        the SYSTEM CONFIGURATION MENU does not activate changes in the graphics settings. Changing
        anything on this menu will cause the game to restart the video. <br>
        <br>
        GRAPHICS MODE: This is a global setting for the display of the game's screen graphics. The
        settings are HIGH QUALITY, NORMAL, FAST, FASTEST, and CUSTOM. Selecting one of these
        choices affects most of the other settings on this page. If you make any adjustments to
        other settings on this page, the graphics mode changes to CUSTOM. <br>
        <br>
        DRIVER: Default OpenGL defaults to the libGL.so library. The 3DFX option applies to the
        included Glide compiled libMesaGL.so.3. <br>
        <br>
        VIDEO MODE: This is the screen resolution size. Smaller resolutions can improve
        performance speed on slower machines. <br>
        <br>
        COLOR DEPTH: Determines whether you are using 16-bit textures or 32-bit textures. Default
        means you run with the color depth currently set for your computer's desktop. <br>
        <br>
        FULLSCREEN: A YES selection allows you to choose to run with the test filling the entire
        screen. A NO selection will run the game in a window. If run in a window, COLOR DEPTH is
        disabled because you are limited to whatever has been selected for the desktop. <br>
        <br>
        LIGHTING: Allows you to chose either a LIGHTMAP or VERTEX lighting. Using the LIGHTMAP is
        recommended for best appearance. VERTEX lighting may improve game performance, but at a
        cost to appearance. <br>
        <br>
        GEOMETRIC DETAIL: Lets you adjust the number subdivisions used to define curves in the
        arena on both world geometry and items, weapons and characters. HIGH is the normal
        setting. LOW greatly reduces curve complexity. <br>
        <br>
        SCREEN SIZE: The slide control changes the amount of screen area devoted to display of the
        game. Reducing screen size can improve performance. <br>
        <br>
        TEXTURE DETAIL: This sliding control allows you to adjust the level of detail displayed.
        Unless you have an extremely fast computer, the normal setting gives the best balance of
        detail vs. game speed. <br>
        <br>
        TEXTURE QUALITY: This determines whether you wish to use 32-bit textures, 16-bit textures,
        or compressed textures. Many of the game's special effects will appear at their best only
        when defined by 32-bit textures. <br>
        <br>
        OPENGL EXTENSIONS: Allows you to enable or disable OPENGL extensions. <br>

        floating in your view at the bottom of the screen. There is an indicator for your ammo
        (far left) including the type of ammo currently in use, current health (left-center), your
        character portrait (center), armor (center-right), and Frag Count (far right). The digital
        timer in the upper right shows the amount of time you have been in this arena. When you
        have a one-use item in your inventory (such as the personal teleporter), its icon will
        appear on the right side of your display. When you are fragged, the character portrait and
        name of the foe who killed you appears in the upper right corner of the display. When you
        change weapons, icons representing the ammo of the weapons in your inventory will appear
        above your character portrait. If you have a weapon, but no ammunition for it, the

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The descriptions below are based on the preset
        default configurations for the game controls. If you have played first person shooting
        games previously (such as Quake or Quake 2), you may want to reconfigure the controls to
        match your preferences. </font></p>

        | ACTIONS |<br>
        +----------+<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">WALKING: Use the four arrow keys or the mouse to
        walk around. To walk steadily forward, hold down the &quot;forward&quot; key (the up arrow
        or center button on a 3-button mouse). Turn left or right with the left or right arrow
        keys, or by sliding your mouse in the desired direction. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">RUNNING: To run, simply hold down the left Shift
        key to increase your speed. If you prefer to always run during the game, open the Main
        menu, then the Customize Controls menu, and select Always Run. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">SHOOTING: Tap the Ctrl key or the left mouse
        button to fire. Hold the shooting key down to keep firing. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">LOOKING UP AND DOWN: The letters A and Z allow
        you to look up and down, respectively. Start walking forward and your line of vision will
        automatically readjust to the center position. You may also choose to select Free Look
        under the Controls menu which will allow you to move the mouse around as if it was your
        head movement. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">SWIMMING: While underwater, aim yourself in the
        direction you wish to go and press the forward key to go in that direction. Unfortunately,
        as in real life, you may lose your bearings while underwater. Use the jump key, (default
        is the Space Bar), to kick straight up towards the surface. Once on the surface, tread
        water by holding down the jump key. To get out of the drink, swim toward the shore and you
        can either jump up onto the land or walk straight out if it is shallow enough. There is
        always a way out of water, but you may have to submerge even deeper in order to find it. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">CROUCHING: Press and hold down the C key to duck
        and move forward to &quot;duck walk.&quot; When you release the C key, you will return to
        an upright position. It is also possible to avoid rockets in this manner. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">JUMPING: Tap the space bar to jump. You jump
        farther if you're moving forward at the time. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">STRAFING: Hold down the ALT key and the left or
        right arrow key and you will side-step in that particular direction. This is perfect for
        avoiding incoming weapon attacks. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">PICKING UP OBJECTS: To pick up items, weapons,
        and power-ups, simply walk over them. The weapon cross-hair will pulse larger briefly to
        indicate you have acquired a new weapon or supply. If you are unable to pick something up,
        it means you already have the maximum amount possible for that object. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">TALKING: To communicate with other players,
        press the T key and type in your message. Press Enter when finished and your words will
        appear at the top of the screen. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">ATTACKING: Point your weapon at an opponent and
        press the fire button. Default fire keys are the left mouse and the control key). If a
        weapon runs out of ammo, it switches to the next available weapon with ammo. If you have
        no ammo at all, you fight with the gauntlet. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">When you die, the weapon you were using (except
        for the gauntlet and the machine gun), and any active power ups drop where you died.
        Armor, ammo and one-use items like the teleporter are lost. To respawn into the game,
        press the fire key. When you re-enter the game you are once again armed with only your
        starting equipment. </font></p>

        +-----------------------+<br>
        | RAPID TRANSIT DEVICES |<br>
        +-----------------------+<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">TELEPORTERS: These devices instantaneously move
        you to a pre-selected destination. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">PORTALS: These are devices that generate holes
        in space through which you can see your ultimate destination and move to it like walking
        through a doorway. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">JUMP PADS: Jump pads throw you upwards to land
        on higher portions of the arena. You have some &quot;air&quot; control over your final
        landing point. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">ACCELERATION PADS: Acceleration pads turn you
        into a human cannon ball, launching you to distant locations in the arena. As with the
        jump pads, you have some &quot;air&quot; control over your final landing point. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><br>
        +-----------------------+<br>
        | ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS |<br>
        +-----------------------+<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">LAVA: Walking on lava is not instantly fatal,
        but even with good armor protection, it can be a relatively quick (and noisy) doom. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">THE VOID: Falling off into the infinite
        blackness of the void is a near inescapable death. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><br>
        +--------------+<br>
        | TEST ARSENAL |<br>
        +--------------+<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">MACHINE GUN: This is your default weapon. It's
        an instant hit attack and reasonably accurate even at long range. It uses bullets. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">GAUNTLET: This is either your weapon of last
        resort when you're out of ammo or a cool tool to humiliate other players. When it hits, it
        does damage and knocks a foe back. It does not require ammunition, but you have to be in
        direct contact with a foe and activating (firing) it to cause injury and knockback. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">SHOTGUN: This uses shells for ammunition. The
        spread of the shotgun blast makes it deadly in close combat, but not the best choice for
        long-range attacks. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">ROCKET LAUNCHER: The rocket launcher delivers
        heavy fire power to your Target, but travels slower compared to other attacks. Be careful
        when you use this weapon in close combat. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">PLASMA GUN: Powered by Energy cells, this
        rapid-fire weapon delivers deadly gouts of glowing energy quickly and accurately. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">RAIL GUN: The Rail Gun fires depleted uranium
        slugs at super high velocities. It hits instantly and can pass through the bodies of
        multiple opponents. But be warned, it recharges slowly and can be a liability in close
        combat. Take note of the distinctive trail of atmospheric disturbance caused by the
        projectile. The color of the rail gun's trail can be changed under the CUSTOMIZE PLAYER
        menu on the EFFECTS COLOR line. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><br>
        +------------------+<br>

        +------------------+<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Pick up these helpful items whenever possible.
        Some items take effect when picked up, others you must activate during play. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">AMMO: With the exception of the gauntlet, each
        weapon has a corresponding ammo type. The color of the ammo boxes corresponds with the
        color of the graphic weapon icons displayed briefly in your heads up display. Each ammo
        type has a maximum you can carry. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">ARMOR: There are three armor types: Green armor
        shards, yellow combat armor and red body armor. Collecting them increases your armor
        protection. The red armor and the green armor shards can increase your total armor
        protection above the maximum for short duration. The points &quot;decay&quot; back to the
        normal maximum value. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">HEALTH: There are three types of standard health
        kits: small (green), medium (yellow) and large (red) encased in crystalline shells. The
        green health can increase your total health value above the maximum. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">QUAD DAMAGE: The quad temporarily multiplies all
        your weapon's strengths. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">MEGA HEALTH: This blue health power up provides
        a temporary but significant boost to your health, taking it above your maximum level. Like
        armor, it &quot;decays&quot; back to your maximum possible health value. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">PERSONAL TELEPORTER: Grab this single-use power
        up and use it to escape from dangerous situations. Activating it immediately teleports you
        to one of the arena's spawn spots. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><br>
        =======================<br>
        == Section 9. ==<br>
        == THE GAME CONSOLE ==<br>
        =======================<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The game console (or just the console) is a pull
        down window shade that shows recent game information, including the text of conversations
        and recently executed game commands. The bottom line of the console is the command line.
        While playing Q3test, you can enter into console mode by pressing the tilde (~) key and
        exit by pressing it again. The console is where you enter all the commands to change the
        game state. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">For example, one console command is &quot;map <NAME>&quot;
        which will load a map and start it up. Starting up a map actually starts a local Server
        and a Client. For the purposes of this test, most of the console commands will be executed
        to optimize graphics. Pressing the up and down arrows in the console will change to the
        last command entered. You can backspace over the command and enter new values if you'd
        like. There is also a command-completion function. Type in the first few letters of a
        command. By pressing the TAB key, you can have the console automatically finish the name
        of the command for you. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">When you are in console mode (or when you have
        selected to &quot;talk&quot; by typing in words to appear on the screen), a blue
        &quot;voice balloon&quot; will appear over your head. Common game courtesy is to NOT shoot
        players who are in this mode. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><br>
        =======================<br>
        == Section 10. ==<br>
        == PROBLEM ICONS ==<br>
        =======================<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Q3Test has a Problem Icon that you may see on
        your screen from time to time. When you are disconnected from a Quake Server or the
        network packet flow is disturbed, you will see a Network Disconnect icon above the spot
        where your frag count is displayed. If you are not immediately reconnected to the server,
        you will need to disconnect (leave arena) and attempt to reconnect with the server by
        either using the menu commands or by typing &quot;connect&quot; &lt;server IP address&gt;
        in the console command line. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><br>
        ======================<br>
        == Section 11. ==<br>
        == KNOWN ISSUES ==<br>
        ======================<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Q. My mouse is erratic. My player is constantly
        looking up or down and I can't seem to move him. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">A. This happens with two issues. Some versions
        of XFree86 have a bug in DGA mouse handling that confuses Q3Test. You can try turning off
        DGA mouse support by entering &quot;+set in_dgamouse 0&quot; on the command line when you
        start Q3Test. This problem can also occur after a restart of the video system (such as
        after a graphic setting change). This is because some sort of event occurred to jam up the
        mouse. Restarting the video system another time and not moving the mouse during the
        restart should clear it. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Q. When I do a video restart (for example,
        selecting Apply in the Graphics Options menu), Q3Test exits with a Sig11. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">A. This is a driver related problem. On 3DFX
        hardware that is using the /dev/3dfx device and you are NOT running as root, it seems that
        the restart doesn't clear some sort of permission. Running Q3Test as root will fix this
        problem. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Q. Performance is so slow I can't play! The
        frame rate looks like one frame per second! </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">A. Most of the current drivers for Linux do not
        support hardware acceleration at any bit depth other than 15 or 16 bit color. Make sure
        that you specify 16 bit color when you run your X11 Server, such as: <br>
        startx -- -bpp 16 <br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Q. I was playing Q3Test and suddenly it quit and
        reported a signal error. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">A. This is probably a bug. Please report it. </font></p>

        ======================<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Exposure to some kinds of flashing lights is
        known to trigger epileptic seizures and/or loss of consciousness in some people. These
        triggers are all around us, a part of our day to day lives. It is possible that images on
        television or in some video or computer could trigger these kinds of reactions. They might
        even affect persons who have no past history of epilipsy or related seizures. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">If you, or anyone in your family has ever had
        symptoms that might indicate epilepsy when exposed to flashing lights, please consult your
        doctor before playing this game. Furthermore, we suggest that parents should monitor the
        use of all video and computer games by their children. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">If a player experiences the symptoms described
