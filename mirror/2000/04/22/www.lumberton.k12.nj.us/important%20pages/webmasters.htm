      Being the head of the club, it's my duty to kick out all the people who do nothing but play <font color="#FFFF80">Bust a Move</font> for every session and never do any work. We have a term for these people, here, and it's <i>plebs</i>, short for latin <i>plebians</i> which means "commoners" or "ordinary people." Within the jobs on the site, I write my bio from time to time, and maintain all of the flashy stuff -- you know, when you see it you go "ooh." Or at least, you're supposed to. I'm working on a few sites of my own, one of which is up at the moment at <a href="http://members.xoom.com/ajlvi">(members.xoom.com/ajlvi)</a>.<br>
