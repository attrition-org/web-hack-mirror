    Erm... this year ended quite... abruptly. Ah, '</font><font color="pink" face="Verdana" size="-1">well</font><font color="pink" face="verdana">,
  what are you 'gonna do about it? No real development in the past few weeks...
  however, the pizza last week was pretty good. ^_^<br>
  <br>
  A quick shoutout list: Thanks to the Big Book 'o HTML for being my 'bible'...
  Applause goes out to the eighth grade class for their graduation. They were a
  great help and all they've done will be remembered for a long time to come ...
  thanks to Ashley for his great sense of humor. He took in every joke we threw
  at him ^_^ and ... erm, ... thanks to Mr. Wilk for <strike>paying off the
  pizza in quarters</strike> and the kudos. ^_^<br>
  <br>
  Now and then, check to see if my place, <a href="http://www.ajlplace.com/" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true" onmouseover="window.status='ajlplace.com -- soon'; return true">www.ajlplace.com</a>,
  is up ... it's pretty spectacular, if they allow shameless self-promotion. ^_^<br>
  <br>
  And... if I acquire your email in some way (or if you give it to me -- the
  pop3 is alizzi@bellatlantic.net) ... watch your box -- some stuff will be in
  there soon.</font></font><font color="pink" face="verdana" size="-2">

  here we are.&nbsp; The final update of the school year.&nbsp; This is it--you
  don't hear from me <i>any</i>more.&nbsp; I thank Adam for making this design,
  and for not yelling at me when I messed up the design in FrontPage.&nbsp; Oh
  yeah, I also thank him for his humorous views of anything.&nbsp; I'd also like
  to thank Matt for....making stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks Matt.&nbsp; I really
  shouldn't, but I thank KoRn for providing the wonderful Punk Rock music.&nbsp;
  Yay.&nbsp; Well...that's it.<br>

  End of the 1999 school year (99.6.17)<br>
  <br>
  Well, first of all, it has been a banner year for our web site.&nbsp; We began
  with an index page and some old web page remnants, and constructed what you
  see in front of you today.&nbsp; I'm very proud of how much support we've had
  and the hard work of the webmasters, especially
  Tristan and Adam.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are so many people to thank though, that
  I've set up a special thank you section below.<br>
  <br>
  I'd also like to point out some of our achievements this year.&nbsp; Th</font><font color="pink" face="Verdana">e
  visual tour</font><font color="pink" face="verdana">, faculty pages,
  panoramas, newspaper, and student showcase sections all
  turned out quite well.&nbsp; I'm also extremely pleased that we are able to
  separate each school through the use of the navbar below.&nbsp; Tune in next
  fall to see what we've been up to . . . see you then</font></font></p>

Well... erm... the page appears
to be about complete. We actually <b>do</b> have a personal page that will go up, however
it's not quite complete yet. Weren't we saying &quot;by the end of March&quot; before? Oh
well...<br>
<br>
Lack of upcoming events has been updated for the remainder of the year.&nbsp; And that
date/time system in the More Options is very, very nice! Deserves my prestigious <b>Seal
of Approval</b>! (<font size="1" color="#FF8000">thanks Adam, says Mr. W.</font>) (it's the first thing we have that's worth
&quot;liberating&quot;)<br>
<br>
A new edition of the <a href="../LMS/newspaper/may99/may.htm"><i>Wildcat Roar</i></a> has been
distributed to the students and is now on-line as well.&nbsp; And... OH! We've got a
little &quot;poll&quot; of sorts coming up, and so... well, now's the time to figure out
who the better webmaster is; myself, Tristan, or Ashley. We'll have it ready for you by
next week; perhaps we could do some little surveys to determine what the students like.
See that? My master plan (of getting students to view the page) is one step closer to
completion.<br>
<br>
Well, sort of. ^_^</font></font></p>

<font size="-1" color="pink">Recoded this table system; works a lot better without the
useless Frontpage marks. I'll be doing some more fixing in a little bit; for now, it looks
like everything's in good order.<br>
<br>
The new car has been awarded to a former webmaster's sister, and the prize for number
15,000 will be just that -- fifteen thousand pennies!<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and apparently we've got a new date/time system in the <a href="../stuff%20from%20old%20web/other.htm">More
Options</a> section; dunno if it works, may be worth checking out. (May even get my <b>seal
of approval</b>...)</font></font></p>

    <font color="pink">Hmmm...an early morning update.&nbsp; I came in early, spoke
    about the navbar with Mr. W, and this is the result: A nicer, more compact bar.&nbsp; No
    longer do we have a huge, takes-up-33%-of-the-screen navigational area, but now, a quiet,
    more gentler bar.&nbsp; Enjoy, and I'll be back the end of the week.</font></font></p>

    <font color="pink" face="Verdana">Hmm... we moved the navbar from the top to the
    side. It doesn't suit my personal taste, but if I were to change it, it would be changed
    back by the time it's uploaded (*ahem ahem*) so it's not worth the effort. The pictures
    are of a different font, which makes it look even worse. (this is why I was given the
    navbar job in the past). Hopefully I'll be able to get this changed back sometime, but for
    now, enjoy.</font></font></p>
