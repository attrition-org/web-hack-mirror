challenging academics. The goal is to allow the students to learn with confidence,
fostering cooperation and collaboration to help all students succeed. Students in grades 3
and 4 are taught in a self-contained format; students in grades 5 are semi-self contained,
taught by one primary teacher and teacher &quot;teams&quot; for selected subjects.

number of subjects. Grade 7 and 8 students change classrooms and teachers with each

<p></font><font FACE="Tahoma" color="#FFFF00">Curriculum</font></p>

<p>Technology is a major focus in the Lumberton School District. Lumberton continues to
lead the majority of South Jersey school districts in incorporating technology into the
schools and into the curriculum. Currently each classroom in every school has two student
computers, as well as one teacher workstation. Additional computers will be added to
classrooms this summer. The goal is to end up with six computers for students, along with
one teacher workstation, in every district classroom.</p>

<p>Children in younger grades receive regular computer time to become familiar with how it
works, learn basic interactive programs, and e-mail partners in neighboring schools across
the country. Older students perform Internet research, develop spreadsheets, learn word
processing, and eventually develop multimedia presentations, which incorporate sound,
video and graphics. Many of the students enjoy cross-grade technology instruction through
the year.</p>

<p>All students from grades 1-8 participate in many academic specials. Children in the
Florence L. Walther School enjoy instruction in Art, Music, Library/Media Center, Physical
Education, and Health. Bobby&#146;s Run Students receive instruction in Art, Computer Lab,
Music, Library/Media Center, Physical Education, Health and World Languages. Middle School
students also add to the list Critical Thinking/Creative Problem Solving, Cultural
Diversity, Drama/Public Speaking, Family and Consumer Science, Journalism and Study
Skills.</p>
