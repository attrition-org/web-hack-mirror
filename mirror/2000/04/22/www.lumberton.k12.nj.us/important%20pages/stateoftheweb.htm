        there's not much else we need to do here -- we have just created a <a href="../updates/important%20pages/email&fac.htm">page</a>

        the time, we'd love to hear how incredible this site really is. (not
        like we don't know it already.) Counter and some other stuff (guestbook?)
        might be going up, I don't really know what's going to happen 'till
        after I get some word regarding what our server supports.

<p align="left">A special thanks goes out to Adam for redoing the index
page.&nbsp; It looks great!!&nbsp; If you haven't noticed, we have a new look
for the 1999-2000 school year.&nbsp; We are also creating pages for every
teacher in the district and have almost reached our goal.&nbsp; I'd like to
thank Brian, Leigh, and Sean for their help in creating and linking the
pages.&nbsp; To view the teacher pages, all one needs to do is click on the
faculty e-mail / web page link and go to the appropriate school.&nbsp; That is
all for now.&nbsp; Enjoy the upload.</p>
