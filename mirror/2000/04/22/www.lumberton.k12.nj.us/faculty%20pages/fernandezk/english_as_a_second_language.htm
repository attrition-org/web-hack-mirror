<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The English as a Second Language Program is recommended for students who
speak a language other than English as their primary language. This includes
students born or educated in a country where English is not the primary
language, or those who live in homes where a language other than English is
spoken. When these students are identified during enrollment or transfer, they
are evaluated with a Language Proficiency Test Instrument that has been approved
by the State of NJ Dept. of Bilingual Education. Limited English Proficient
students are classified at beginner, intermediate, or advanced levels of
proficiency. They are scheduled based on their proficiency and grade levels.</p>
<p>Students receive instruction in four skill areas: listening, speaking,
reading, and writing; and will demonstrate the ability to combine those skills
to communicate effectively. They will also receive instruction in the content
areas through the ESL curriculum or the mainstream classroom content through ESL
teacher support of the mainstream content teacher. The goal of the ESL program
is to enable the student to function independently in mainstream classrooms and
ultimately in English speaking society. The program also provides an
introduction to American culture, history, and beliefs, which may be new to
foreign students.</p>
<p>Students are exited from the program using multiple criteria which include a
passing score on the English Proficiency test, passing grades in mainstream
classes, mainstream teacher input, and ESL teacher input.</p>
<b>
<p>Grading/Scheduling</p>
</b>
<p>Students who are classified as beginning level students will be permitted a
pass/fail grade for subjects that it is impossible to assess progress or skills.
Intermediate level students should be given grades if possible, but are eligible
for pass/fail status, particularly in language embedded content areas such as
Social Studies. Advanced students should receive grades in all mainstream
classrooms.</p>
<p>Any questions about ability level of students should be directed at the ESL
teacher. I will be happy to meet with you to discuss your questions.</p>
