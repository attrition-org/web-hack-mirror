were Mr.Macanga I would be teaching LA, SS, and Study Skills. I could drive a
car and I would teach the kids. All of the kids would have to listen to me. I
would have a family and I would be smarter then I am now. Sometimes I would have
lunch duty. I would give homework to kids.</font></p>
<p><font color="#800080" face="Lucida Sans">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If
Mr.Macanga were me, he would have to go home and play video games until my
parents came home. After my parents came home he would have to eat dinner, then
do his homework. He would have to give my sister some homework then he could
watch a Turkish movie. When it's about 9:00 clock he would take a shower. Then
he would go to bed and tell my sister a story until she falls asleep.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">We were waiting to get tickets to come to America. One day my
father called us and said you can buy tickets tomorrow. Then my mother, sister,
and I were so happy. The next day my mother and my cousin went to Ankara, Turkey
to get tickets. When they were in Ankara, my sister and I stayed at my
grandmother's house. We wanted to go but my mother didn't let us.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">When they came back from Ankara I saw the tickets in my
mother's purse. Then my mother said we were going to America next week. We were
so happy. Then we were getting ready to go to America. We filled suitcases with
clothes and other stuff. My mom said we were going with my uncle to Ankara
because during the next week he was going back to his home in Ankara. That week
my uncle picked us up. That night we sleep over at his house. In the morning we
ate our breakfast and got ready to go the airport. When we got to the airport
they checked our suitcases and looked at our passports and other papers. A few
minutes later they called, &quot;If you are going to America please get ready to
get in the airplane.&quot; Then a small bus came and picked up the people who we
were going to America.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">When we got in the airplane, it was so big. On the airplane we
put the seat belts on so we could be safe. We started to fly. I was so scared.
Little while later the ladies started to serve the food, but I wasn't too hungry
and when I tasted I didn't like it. We were flying eleven hours up in the sky. I
went to sleep for about seven hours. When I woke up I was still tired and I
stood up and went to the toilet. I started to walk with my sister in the
airplane. Then after about six hours we finally got to America. I felt so happy
because I was going to see my father. Also I was scared about going to school
because I didn't know any English.</font></p>

<p>Dear Journal,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Today I'm leaving to go to the United States. I am very sad, but happy at
    the same time. I'm sad because I'm leaving and happy because I'm going to
    see my parents. Right now I'm in the car going to the airport . We're here!</p>
    <p>Wow! It is very crowded here at the airport. Right now I'm going on the
    plane. Well, got to go.... Hey I'm back. I went to sleep all that time. It
    was weird because I'm used to sleeping</p>
    <p>flat, not sitting up. When I got up eat, no offense, but the food was
    disgusting. When I saw that, I said, &quot;YUK! I don't want to eat
    that.&quot;</p>
    <p>Well I've definitely got to go now, BYE!</p>

on a plane. It was fun. I was happy because I went to see my uncle, cousin, and
my aunt. I love them a lot. I was there for 14 days.</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="4" color="#800000" FACE="Arial">On the plane, I could watch
television. I did not sleep well on the plane because I am used to sleeping flat
not sitting up. When I went on the plane they gave me disgusting food. On the
plane, I sat between my mom and my brother. My brother sat beside my cousin
