<font face="Impress BT" SIZE="4">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a non-English speaking student is assigned to your class do not be
alarmed. Language acquisition is a natural process and the student will learn
English no matter what happens in your classroom. He will learn by listening and
repeating the things he hears, and will usually learn quickly because he has to.
The student will succeed to a greater degree with your help though, There are
many things you can do to help the ESL student along.
</font></p>
<p>

<font face="Impress BT" SIZE="4">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First is to determine the student’s English skill level, this can be done
by consulting with the ESL teacher or through informal observation and
questioning. There are three ability levels you may observe. A child at the
first level may have little or no English language skills at all. He may be able
to name isolated items and actions. He may have memorized parts of
conversations. Begin by introducing objects in the classroom, verbs related to
schoolwork and expectations. Use simple conversation techniques.
</font></p>
<p>

<font face="Impress BT" SIZE="4">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second level student has acquired conversation skills and can name many
objects. He will have difficulty with complex constructions and vocabulary.
</font></p>
<p>

<font face="Impress BT" SIZE="4">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A level three student will speak, understand and read English fairly well,
but lack some grammar and comprehension skills. Academic writing is difficult
for these students. Again increasing vocabulary, reading comprehension, and
writing skills should be the focus.
</font></p>
<p>

<font face="Impress BT" SIZE="4">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point to remember is that the parents are new to this country as well
and may have difficulty with school related materials and services. In most
other countries there is very little school contact, and parents do not expect
to communicate regularly with teachers. They are unfamiliar with special
programs and school regulations.
</font></p>
<p>

<font face="Impress BT" SIZE="4">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though communication may be difficult, make an effort to contact parents when
necessary. They will be very grateful.

Adaptations in the Classroom
</font></p>
<p><font face="Impress BT">Listening is the first step in language acquisition. A new student should not
be forced to answer or participate in presentations right away. Use your judgment
as to how the student is progressing, watch how he interacts with
peers. In 2 or 3 months, most students feel comfortable enough in class to
participate regularly. Be consistent with your language, and don’t use
idiomatic expressions. Repeat instructions using simplified language the second
time. Initially assign a buddy to the student to assist with understanding page
numbers and assignments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Impress BT">The more visual your presentation is, the easier it will be for the students
to comprehend the content. Charts, maps, graphs, and pictures all enhance
understanding for ESL students. Real life items or models also reinforce
concepts. Picture cards or dictionaries will increase vocabulary.</font></p>
<p><font face="Impress BT">Simplifying vocabulary and focusing on one or two important aspects of the
content will narrow the input the student needs to understand. Reviewing at the
end of each period also gives the student an opportunity to reinforce
understanding of new content and language.</font></p>
<p><font face="Impress BT">Finally, adapt assignments to meet the student’s ability level. Have him
draw a picture, make a chart, generate a list, or give an oral summary. This
enables you to have an idea of what the student comprehends and provides the
child the opportunity to demonstrate what he has learned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Impress BT">It is also important to recognize that a child’s social language will
develop more quickly than his academic language. Just because you may see him
speaking English to his friends does not mean he comprehends the content
specific vocabulary of your class. Also remember that these students have a
background that does not include American historical, cultural, or social
references.</font></p>
<p><font face="Impress BT">This is just a general overview of some of the strategies you could use in
your classroom. If you have further questions or would like more input, please
contact me. The first few months in a new country, learning a new language is
difficult. The first priority is to provide a welcome environment and the rest
will come.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Impress BT">Criteria for Grading</font></p>
</b>
<p><font face="Impress BT">For a Limited English Proficient Student to receive a
pass they <b>must</b> complete the following requirements.</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Impress BT">Student must be attentive in class.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Impress BT">Student makes an effort to follow classroom
    instruction.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Impress BT">Student hands in assignments with the assistance
    of the ESL teacher.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Impress BT">Student hands in assignments without the
    assistance of the ESL teacher.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Impress BT">Students can orally explain content material when
    questioned.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Impress BT">Students can demonstrate comprehension of content
    through alternate means of assessment - demonstration, illustration, or oral
    summary.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Impress BT">Please use you professional judgement when grading
Limited English Proficient students. If the majority of your grades are based on
some type of performance (art, chorus, keyboarding), then even a beginning
student may have standard grades and not need a pass/fail grade.</font></p>
<p><font face="Impress BT">Remember that standard grades may be given to
alternative assessments as well. Slightly altering assignments so that LEP
students can respond to the same content that other students are answering not
only gives you a means of evaluating understanding, but the student feels less
isolated from his or her classmates. For example:</font></p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><font face="Impress BT">Answering questions instead of writing a
      summary.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Impress BT">Drawing a picture or graph.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Impress BT">List only main ideas, not details.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Impress BT">Reduce the number of steps or requirements in an
      assignment.</font></li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><font face="Impress BT">For some assignments, additional time may be required
for completion. Any major assignments (book reports, projects) should be given
directly to the ESL teacher as soon as possible so that I can direct and monitor
student progress.</font></p>
