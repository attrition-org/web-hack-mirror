goal each year in second grade is to create a&nbsp; positive, caring and
supportive environment for learning in my classroom. I want each child,
regardless of his or her ability, to experience and enjoy an ongoing series of
successes during the year. Second grade is an important year in terms of
building upon reading and writing skills and confidence. Students learn to take
on more responsibility for themselves especially in the areas of&nbsp; homework
and behavior. Cooperation, being part of a team and tolerance for the
differences among ourselves are important social concepts we discuss and
practice.</font></span></p>
