<p align="left">On a hot summer day many years ago, a boy weighing 8 pounds was born in
Philadelphia and given the name John Baily. Upon arriving home he met two more boys who
turned out to be his brothers. Tom was 18 months old and the bigger brother, Joe, was old
enough that he was getting ready for kindergarten in the fall.<br>
<br>
At the time John was just beginning to walk, the family moved to a suburban area called
Oreland, Pennsylvania. Wow, that was great! An elementary school, much like Walther
School, was across the street. There were large fields where John, his brothers and
friends spent many hours playing baseball and touch football. The school yard and
basketball court provided hours of fun for tournaments. Each year the fourth of July was a
big event and the Lions Club would have a parade that ended at the school. That would be
followed by contests, free refreshments, fireworks and the world's best birch beer.<br>
<br>
John's elementary school had one class of students per grade level. There was one bus that
brought a small group of students who lived farther away. John always thought they were so
lucky to ride on a bus. When it was time to go to junior high school, he too was a bus
student. After a few months riding the bus wasn't exciting anymore.<br>
<br>
For John's final year of junior high school he had a wonderful experience that many of our
Walther School students will enjoy. He attended a newly opened school. It was beautiful.<br>
<br>
With many new families in the community, a bigger church was built too. The church was
just two blocks away and John enjoyed being an acolyte in church throughout his high
school days. He helped the minister during the service on two Sundays every month.<br>
<br>
Some of John's best memories of high school surround his days on the football field. He
was a member of the wrestling team too. Influenced by one of his coaches, he chose to go
to college to become a teacher. Mr. Baily attended West Chester State College and believes
that it was an outstanding school for teacher training. A year after graduation, he
entered Villanova University and received a master's degree in education with emphasis on
school guidance counseling and administration. Since that time he has taken more courses
at Glassboro State College, Rutgers University and Rider College.<br>
<br>
Mr. Baily has taught students at several grade levels and coached high school football and
basketball. He has been a guidance counselor and since 1974 has had the privilege of being
principal at Walther School. Most of these years the school included grades kindergarten
through eighth. He says, &quot;Our students are super, the teachers are terrific and our
parents are a pleasure.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mr. Baily lives in Medford Lakes with his wife Cathy and two children. Mrs. Baily is a
first grade teacher who loves helping students learn to read. The family dog, Tuxie,
spends lots of time watching for Brian and Melissa to arrive home from college. <br>
