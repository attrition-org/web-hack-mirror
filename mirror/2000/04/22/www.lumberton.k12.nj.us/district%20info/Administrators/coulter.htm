<p>Janet Coulter, Principal of the Bobby&#146;s Run School, is 16-year veteran in the
Lumberton School District. Ms. Coulter began her position as Principal in May 1998 and is
the first Principal of the Bobby&#146;s Run School. She has been involved in the education
of children in Lumberton since she began in 1980 as a member of a multi-district Child
Study Team consortium that included the Lumberton schools.</p>

<p>In 1986, Ms. Coulter was hired exclusively in Lumberton as a full-time counselor, where
she developed and updated the district&#146;s guidance program. In 1995, Ms. Coulter was
appointed district-wide Curriculum Coordinator. Her responsibilities included assuring the
district&#146;s curriculum is aligned with the State of New Jersey&#146;s Core Curriculum
Content Standards, reviewing and revising school curriculum, overseeing staff development
and training, and procuring grants for the district. She held that position until her most
recent appointment.</p>

<p>Janet Coulter earned a Bachelor of Science in 1970, and a Master of Science in 1971,
both in Education, from the University of Tennessee&#146;s Martin Campus. She taught in
Tennessee for two years before relocating to Arizona where she taught first through third
grades before coming to the Lumberton area. In 1996, Ms. Coulter earned an additional
master&#146;s degree in Educational Administration from Rider University.</p>

<p>&quot;When I first came to Lumberton, we had 400 students in one school. Now we have
over 1,300 children and three schools,&quot; she notes. &quot;To see the district grow in
such a positive direction has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my job.&quot;</p>

<p>As a former teacher, Ms. Coulter&#146;s vision for the Bobby&#146;s Run School is
simple: &quot;To encourage an environment where every child succeeds,&quot; she says.
&quot;I&#146;m excited about working with the third, fourth and fifth-grade teachers who
are part of the school. Knowing them, their background and their abilities, I am confident
that success for all students is attainable.&quot;</p>
<b>

<p></b>Superintendent of Schools, Frank Logandro, notes, &quot;Janet Coulter exemplifies
what a Principal should be, by her ability to balance her empathy for, and love of,
children with her ability to be an effective leader in, and advocate for, the school
district. Janet&#146;s dedicated service to this district for the past 16 years made the
transition of opening a new school an easier one for students, parents and staff.&quot;</p>
