<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark S. Leung has been working
for the Lumberton Schools since September of 1996. He has a BS in Industrial
Engineering with a minor in Economics from Lehigh University in Bethlehem,
PA. Mr. Leung is a member of the Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE),
Tau Beta Pi (Engineering honor society), and Alpha Pi Mu (Industrial Engineering
honor society). He is currently seeking his Master’s degree in School Administration
from Rowan University in Glassboro, NJ. Before coming to Lumberton Schools,
Mr. Leung worked for five years as a management consultant for Price Waterhouse,
LLP, specializing in SAP software implementations for various Fortune 50
multi-national chemical companies. Once he began tiring of airports, living
out of his suitcase, and only seeing his new bride two days out of the
week (she worked for Price Waterhouse, LLP also), Mr. Leung decided to
look for a career change. Since he knew he loved working with kids and
sharing his knowledge of Math/Computers, Mr. Leung looked into New Jersey’s
Alternate Route to teacher certification. After completing the program,
he was given the Secondary Mathematics certification in New Jersey. After
two years of teaching, Mr. Leung was offered the position of Technology
Coordinator and he now manages the district’s computer network and oversees
the technology. On July 1, 1999, Mr. Leung was promoted to the position
of Director of Educational Technology for the Lumberton School District.</FONT>
