cultural differences. The commitment of the Board of Education to quality
programs will clearly focus on educational experiences, beginning at
kindergarten through eighth grade, that promote excellence through an active and
responsible partnership with the community, a visionary and innovative
curriculum and a dedicated and knowledgeable staff.</p>
