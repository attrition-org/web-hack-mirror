<p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the nineteenth century, Lumberton Township
included what is now Hainesport Township. This large municipality contained five schools:
Easton, Lumberton, Eayrestown, Fostertown and Hainesport. All five of these buildings are
still standing but only one is still being used for school purposes. The original
Hainesport school is still in use as a small portion of the present school. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1917 the people of Lumberton felt that the
children would have a better educational opportunity if the small one- and two-room
schools were consolidated into one four-room building. This was done at that time. The
people of Hainesport felt they would rather maintain their own school, thus the division
of municipalities. The building of the consolidated school took place in 1918 and it
became known as the Lumberton Public School building. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lumberton Township was the first school district in
New Jersey to own and operate a school bus. The Lumberton Parent-Teacher Association was
organized one year after the state association was organized. Today, the PTA is lead by
Marilynda Boyer and a group of dedicated women serving on the executive committee. The
Lumberton School was one of the first in New Jersey to provide hot lunches to the
children. These lunches were prepared by parents and brought to the school.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1940 three classrooms were added to the four-room
building. Two more rooms were added in 1952 and nine rooms were added in 1955. The next
addition was completed by 1961.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elementary school on Chestnut Street is named in
honor of Mrs. Florence L. Walther, principal and teacher in Lumberton until her retirement
in 1939. Mrs. Walther resided on East Landing Street until her death in 1957. Mrs. Walther
as principal, and her husband William Walther as District Clerk, were the real leaders in
the consolidation of the school district.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the 1990-1991 school year additions were
completed at the Walther School. Correspondingly, the 1917 wing was demolished during the
summer of 1991. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September of 1991, the Lumberton Middle School
opened its doors for the first time.&nbsp; In September 1996 a new wing housing ten
classrooms, two science demonstration rooms, and one computer lab was opened.&nbsp; While
in January 1997 the new auditorium and and music rooms were ready to be used.&nbsp; The
building now houses students in grades six through eight.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September 1998, the Bobby's Run School was opened
for third through fifth grades.&nbsp; The school was named in honor of Lumberton's first
settler, Robert Dimsdale.&nbsp; Mr. Dimsdale, a Quaker, purchased land in 1684 near what
is now Lumberton.&nbsp; He built and operated a sawmill on the property.&nbsp; The Bobby's
Run name comes from a small tributary on the Dimsdale plantation that emptied into the
Rancocas Creek near Lumberton.</font></p>
