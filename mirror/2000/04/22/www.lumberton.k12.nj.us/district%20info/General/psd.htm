<p>WHO ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM?</b></p>

<p>Any child in the district, age three to five, who has not started his or her formal
public school education, and who may show developmental problems, including communication,
physical development, social function, emotional health or an ability to learn or perform
motor skills at an age- appropriate level.</p>
<b>

<p>WHO DETERMINES IF A CHILD SHOULD BE SCREENED?</b></p>

<p>Parents who suspect their child has a developmental disability should contact the
district&#146;s Special Services office. The child will receive a free screening by
specially- trained district Child Study Team members and speech therapists.</p>
<b>

<p>WHAT IS INVOLVED WITH TH ESCREENING PROCESS?</b></p>

<p>If the screening confirms that a child has a handicap that will impede normal school
development, the Child Study team will schedule a comprehensive preschool assessment
evaluation. This child-friendly assessment will determine the nature and extent of the
disability and whether or not the child would benefit PDS. If so, the Child Study Team
will write and an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for the child, focusing on his or
her special needs.</p>
<b>

<p>WHAT IF A PARENT CHOOSES NOT TO HAVE A CHILD EVALUATED, OR NOT TO ACCEPT THE DISTRICTS
RECOMMENDATIONS?</b></p>

<p>Parents must give consent before a child can assessed. Children are placed in the
program only after a parent or guardian agrees--in writing&#151;with the decision onto
have the child evaluated or the direction of the IEP. The program was created to give
special needs preschoolers the best chance of seceding. Enrolling a child in the PDP will
not &quot;label&#146;&#146; or &quot;stigmatize&#146;&#146; a child. </p>
<b>

<p>WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THE PRESCHOOL DISABILITIES PROGRAM?</b></p>

<p>The program&#146;s goal is to prepare children to enter school with social, emotional
and preacademic readiness skills. Experience has shown that the sooner a child&#146;s
special needs are identified and addressed, the greater the chance that the child will
compensate for his or her disability. </p>
<b>

<p>WHAT ARE SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES MY CHILD WILL BE INVOLVED WITH?</p>

<p></b>Lumberton&#146;s Preschool Disabilities Program operates five half days a week. In
each class, one teacher and one aide work with no more than 12 students. Staff members are
trained in special education and early childhood education. Activities are geared toward
preschool-age children and help develop language, motor skills, self-awareness, self-help
skills, school and readiness skills, and social- emotional skills. Depending on a
child&#146;s needs, related services may include physical, occupational and speech
therapy.</p>
<b>

<p>CAN THE DISTRICT HELP SPECIAL-NEEDWS CHILDREN WHO ARE YOUNGER THAN THREE?</b></p>
