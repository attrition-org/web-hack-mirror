<p>What is the difference between Gifted &amp; Talented and Enrichment? </b></p>

<p>The Enrichment Program serves the youngest students in the district. Kindergarten
teachers may use resource support for their exceptional students. Full-class enrichment is
provided to all</p>

<p>students in grades one and two. The Gifted &amp; Talented program serves children in
grades three trough eight who have been identified with advanced academic abilities.</p>
<b>

<p>What is taught in the Elementary Enrichment Program?</b></p>

<p>Some of the topics in the enrichment program include multicultural studies and hands-on
physical science activities. </p>
<b>

<p>Are children enriched any other way?</b></p>

<p>The regular classroom continues to be the primary source of instruction at all grade
levels. Classroom teachers differentiate curriculum and use varying questioning techniques
to consistently monitor and adjust to students&#146; needs. Achievement-based grouping for
mathematics instruction is offered in grades five to eight, including Algebra for eighth
graders. Students in grades seven and eight may also be placed in accelerated classes in
Select Spanish, Language Arts, Science, and Social Studies.</p>
<b>

<p>How are children identified for G&amp;T?</b> </p>

<p>Nominations for G&amp;T may be made by parents, teachers, administrators or students,
usually in the spring. New students may also be nominated in January. The district uses
multiple criteria to determine whether a child is eligible for the program, including
examination of report cards and standardized achievement tests, teacher evaluations, group
and individual intelligence tests and a test for divergent thinking. A committee of
teachers, guidance counselors, curriculum coordinator and the building principal reviews
all information. The committee accepts students who they feel have demonstrated overall
academic excellence and have the potential to successfully meet the program challenges.</p>
<b>

<p>What if my child is denied?</b></p>

<p>If a child is not accepted into the program, the parent or a teacher may re-nominate
the child at the end of any school year.</p>
<b>

<p>How is the G&amp;T program structured?</b></p>

<p>Students usually meet with their grade-level peers three to four periods per week.
Grades three, four and five are usually pulled out of their regular instruction for the
enrichment experiences of G&amp;T classes. Grades six, seven and eight G&amp;T classes are
part of the schedule. </p>
<b>

<p>What are the students&#146; responsibilities?</b></p>

<p>Students are expected to work to their full potential in G&amp;T classes. They must
maintain honor roll marks on all report cards. They are expected to make up work missed in
their regular education program. Beyond that, behavior should be exemplery at all times,
especially when involved in out-of-district experiences, representing Lumberton schools.</p>
<b>

<p>What is taught in G&amp;T classes?</b></p>

<p>Critical thinking and creative problem-solving are emphasized in G&amp;T classes. Past
studies have included logic, environmental issues, civics, economics, national and world
history, analogies, aerospace, law and applied research.</p>
<b>

<p>Is all instruction done in the schools?</b></p>

<p>Students participate in many programs in and out of school. They often traveled to
college campuses throughout the state to present projects to peers from other schools.
Other field experiences may include trips to museums, theaters, historic sites and
scientific research sites.</p>
<b>

<p>How are G&amp;T students evaluated?</b></p>

<p>G&amp;T progress reports are issued twice per year, in February and in June.</p>
<b>

<p>How can I get more information?</b></p>

<p>Parents who would like more information about the Gifted and Talented or Enrichment
Programs should call the principal of your child&#146;s school.</p>
