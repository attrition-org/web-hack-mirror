<p ALIGN="CENTER">District Internet and E-Mail Rules</p>
</b>

<p>Students are responsible for good behavior on school computer networks just as they are
in a classroom or a school hallway. Communications on the network are often public in
nature. General school rules for behavior and communications apply.</p>

<p>The network is provided for students to conduct research and communicate with others.
Access to network services is given to students who agree to act in a considerate manner.
Parent permission is required. <b>Access is a privilege &#150; not a right.</b> Access
entails responsibility.</p>

<p>Individual users of the district computer networks are responsible for their behavior
and communications over those networks. It is presumed that users will comply with
district standards and will honor the agreements they have signed. Beyond clarification of
such standards, the district is not responsible for restricting, monitoring, or
controlling the communications of individuals utilizing the network.</p>

<p><b>Network storage areas may be treated like school lockers.</b> Network administrators
may review files and communications to maintain system integrity and insure that users are
using the system responsibly. Users should not expect that files stored on district
servers will always be private.</p>

<p>Within reason, freedom of speech and access to information will be honored. During
school, teachers of younger students will guide them toward appropriate materials. Outside
of school, families bear the same responsibility for such guidance as they exercise with
information sources such as television, telephones, movies, radio and other potentially
offensive media.</p>

<p>Parents should review the following examples of unacceptable behavior with students. <b>Misuse
of the district computer network may result in loss of access as well as other
disciplinary of legal action.
