Rogue Spear vs SWAT3
<!-- END DATE -->
</b> - </font><font face="arial" size="-1" color="white">
<!-- START POST -->
It seems the hot topic on the forums lately is about the games Rogue Spear and SWAT3.  I love both games, but I am going to break them down for you.  these are my opinions and in no way 
reflect reality, lol.  I will separate them into topics, enjoy.<br><ul>
<li><b>Multiplay</b> - Well since SWAT3 has no multiplay capabilities yet this is a no brainer, Rogue Spear wins.  I will interject my thoughts though.  SWAT3 was built for multiplayer according to Rod 
Fung (the producer of the game) and will offer many ways to play it, from co-op to team based fights.  I think it will rock, what could be more fun that shooting a friend through a wall and yelling at him 
to "GET DOWN".
<li><b>Weapon Selection</b> - I have seen people stating that SWAT3 does not have the great weapon selection Rogue Spear does, well I am glad it does not.  Rogue Spear is based on a multi-national 
organization, while SWAT3 is the LAPD.  It would be nuts for the SWAT team to have access to hundreds of weapons, but be warned, SWAT3 is easily modded and you can expect some awesome mods for it in the future.  I heard rumors of an ARMM one.  
There is no winner for this category, both have good weapons for what they are.
<li><b>Maps</b> - Rogue Spear has awesome maps, I have to say that first.  The outside and inside locations are fantastic.  SWAT3 does not really have any outside locations since they are based on an organization that mostly works in a city.  
But the maps that SWAT3 has are just as well done as the ones in Rogue Spear.  So this category is another tie, and if you doubt me about SWAT3's levels then try some of the later missions, they are large and very well done, mainly the convention center.
<li><b>Weapon Realism</b> - Rogue Spear has more realistic weapons while SWAT3 has more realistic ballistics.  SWAT3 does not seem to take into effect the affects movement and injuries have on your 
aim.  But then again a SWAT unit moves slow on purpose so that that are ultra safe and accurate with their strikes.  But overall Rogue Spear wins this category.
<li><b>Game Speed</b> - Rogue Spear is a slow game compared to others like Quake and Unreal Tourny, but it is still faster than SWAT3.....sometimes.  SWAT3 has two modes, stealth and dynamic.  Stealth is used to move your team slowly so you have 
time to think and react to your situation and environment.  Dynamic mode is for when the s**t hits the fan and you are in the heat of battle.  Dynamic mode is very close to the speed of Rogue Spear so there is once again no winner in this category.
<li><b>Environment Interactivity</b> - This is how your surroundings react to your actions.  Once again SWAT3 wins.  Bullets can penetrate certain structures, mirrors crack, bullets ricochet off metal, rounds and explosions leave marks on items and walls, flashbangs burn items if carelessly thrown near 
a flammable object, and I freaked when I shot a terrorist and I found him by following his blood trail.  Rogue Spear has a very interactive environment also but it is not as immersive as SWAT3. 
<li><b>Additional Items</b> - There is a huge number of items in Rogue Spear as well as SWAT3, but overall SWAT3's items come off more realistic.  The use of chem-lights is awesome, not to mention the fact than CS gas makes the enemy 
cough and react slower, flashbangs actually blind the suspect and he recoils from the explosion.  Rogue Spear has more destructive items while SWAT3 has better executed ones.  I have to give 
this category to SWAT3.  Here are my reasons.  You can hear the pins fall from your flashbangs and CS gas, you can see the glow of the chem-lights, you can blow doors realistically with breaching charges, and you can 
cuff hostages as well as the bad guys.  It is rather rewarding to slap some cuffs on someone as they tell you where to shove your night-stick, hehe.
<li><b>Graphics</b> - SWAT3 beats the living crap out of Rogue Spear on this one.  The lighting is done perfectly, shadows, mirrors, explosions, blood, it is all done with a high level of detail.  
You even drop your used clips on the ground after use.  The modeling of the characters in the game is superb, the mouths move, eyes look around, eyes get wide when in scary situations, and people look like real people.  
You even recoil from the rifles firing, it is visible, as is the smoke and flash of the weapon.  The stunning graphics have to be seen to be appreciated.
<li><b>Sound</b> - SWAT3 wins again.  The sounds in this game are remarkable.  People scream, insult, praise, and act like real people.  I have had people that I handcuffed warn others to run, I have also had 
others tell me not to mess up their Rolex with the cuffs.  This game rocks in the sound department.  It also supports directional sound.
<li><b>AI</b> - The AI in Rogue Spear leaves a lot to be desired.  I have shot one tango only to have another come to the same spot like it is his turn to be killed, this happens all the time.  This will not happen in SWAT3.  
The enemy will react differently each time you encounter them, some even hide in closets.  Some will be aggressive and some will not.  Each character in SWAT3 has its own AI which is independent of the other characters.  
Your team members will actually cover your six instead of following you like robots as the ones in Rogue Spear do.  Tell your guys in SWAT3 to cover you and they will take up positions to do so, and they will do it right!  Tell them to 
breach and clear a room and they do that right also, they even lean around corners.  Sometimes they take to long to fire at an enemy that is not cooperating, but usually they do better than you do.  I have also seen a terrorist use a hostage as a human shield.  SWAT3 wins this category without a doubt.
<li><b>Animations</b> - While Rogue Spear has better death and running animations, SWAT3 wins in this department also.  The reloading and holstering of weapons, throwing items, opening doors, facial expressions, and body movements are 
far superior to Rogue Spears.  I will admit there is nothing cooler than slowing Rogue Spear down after you shoot a guy and watch him spin to the floor.
<li><b>User Support</b> - RSE supports their products well but they do not allow mod creators the ability and options to be free to create mods for the game.  You can change some things in Rogue Spear but you are very limited in what you can do.  RSE has denied releasing any tools for creating custom maps.  
I know you can add items and tangos to a map, but I am referring to programs like the one released with Half-Life.  You need to release or at least have the capabilities in your software to allow your 
audience to create additions for the game and help it thrive in such a competitive field as computer gaming.  SWAT3's addon which will be out soon according to Sierra may come with a map creation program.  I think they will release this, 
this is the company that released Half-Life and that had one.  Sierra has seen how games that can have additions created by the uses make a more enjoyable and longer lasting product.  So in conclusion, SWAT3 wins this category also.</ul>
My last thoughts...I like Rogue Spear a lot and have dedicated much of my time to it.  As far as Sierra goes, I honestly have never liked them, but the release of Half-Life and now SWAT3 has redeemed them in my eyes...not as programmers but as publishers of games.  All in all I think 
SWAT3 is a superior product to Rogue Spear, but you will have to kill me or blackmail me to remove Rogue Spear from my drive and stop playing it.  I enjoy both games and recommend that any gamers who likes first person shooters do the same, both are great products.

<!-- START POST -->
I was browsing the web and came across these awesome panoramic pictures of SWAT3.  Just click one of the pictures to the right and once they load use your mouse to look at the 360 degree surroundings.  If you have purchased 
the game I recommend you try something, stand before a mirror and shoot your weapons.  You will see muzzle flash and smoke come from the weapon and you will jolt from the recoil as well.  
Not what is detail.  If you have not noticed yet when you reload you actually drop a clip on the ground where it will stay.  Another realistic addition is the facial expressions of the models 
in the game.  They actually talk and move their eyes.  I know what you are thinking..."Half-Life has moving mouths and Rogue Spear has blinking eyes), while this is true, SWAT3 has both those 
things and the eyes actually look left and right and get wide when scared.  Tell me this...have you ever had a terrorist use a hostage as a shield from your bullets in a game before?  Well they do it in 
SWAT3.  The AI is so good that your team members will actually check stalls inside bathrooms.  Ok, I will stop ranting now, check out the 360 degree shots.

Taow: Nihon is Released
<!-- END DATE -->
</b> - </font><font face="arial" size="-1" color="white">
<!-- START POST -->
As you all may have heard by now...Mother.May.I. has created a great new mod called Taow: Nihon.  This mod adds an Asian feel with ninjas and samurai warriors.  Myself and many of the 
webmasters from all the great Rogue Spear sites used this mod at the last Webmasters Brawl.  The mod ran flawlessly, I will admit there were problems getting it to work, but that was due to people not reading Mother's 
install instructions.  Due to the limitations of the code in the game some things can not be done, like the animation of swinging swords.  However you barely notice this since the 
combat is so close and furious.  There are distance weapons like throwing stars and knives, not to mention bows.  Most fights come down to steel vs steel fights.  You do have to reload, in a way...you actually restore energy to 
continue the fight, all that swinging swords gets tiring.  There is also magic in the game, you now have ninja magic for stealth.  The first time I saw this it certainty messed with my head, lol.  Mother promises 
to have more additions to the mod with new weapons and maps.  I eagerly await these updates.<br>
My conclusion...This is the most original and perfectly executed mod for Rogue Spear.  It adds a new twist to the game and the skins and sounds are top notch.  I have to congratulate Mother 
on a fine job with his Nihon mod.  For more information visit his site at <a href="http://www.mothermayi.net/mods/mods_taow_1.asp">http://www.mothermayi.net/mods/mods_taow_1.asp</a>.<br>

This has to be one of the most visually stunning games I have seen in a long time. The game play and storyline are great, now if you can just get past the fact that you play a cherub ( small fat baby with wings in pampers ), you are good to go. The bright sides though, You get to possess other people ( the possessing is well done, awesome ), and this cherub is actually pretty funny. He's got a big attitude and digs Big guns..My Favorite part of the whole demo was when you take over a Radiation workers body..and grab a sample from the core and run around people and they end up dying...Hot Potato coming through! You can get the demo <a href="http://www.messiah.com/index2.html">here</a>..give it a try before you  giggle too much.

SWAT 3 and Me
<!-- END DATE -->
</b> - </font><font face="arial" size="-1" color="white">
<!-- START POST -->
I purchased SWAT 3 by <a href="http://www.sierrastudios.com">Sierra Studios</a> yesterday evening and I have to tell you, I got no sleep last night.  This game is so good that 
when the multi-play patch comes out in January or February it will be in direct competition with Rogue Spear for the "King of First Person Tactical Shooter Games".  The graphics 
in the game are the best graphics yet in any game in my opinion.  The sounds are awesome, as is the game play.  You have to keep in mind, this game is as real as it gets.  Rogue Spear feels 
like an arcade game after you have played SWAT 3.  The lighting in the game is great, cut a closet light on and the light and shadows mimic real life perfectly.  Shine your flashlight in the 
mirror and you will have to look twice to make sure you are playing a game and not watching a movie.  When you change weapons or items, the animation of the movements is perfect.  Gone are the look and feel of textures 
laid over models like Rogue Spear, now you can actually see the holster and armor.  You actually put your weapons away and get them back out.  Death animations are done nicely also, realistic blood and 
damage from the rounds is also done great.  Here are a few things that have happened to me so far in the game, and I played each mission over ten times, and they were never the same, I never knew what to expect, here it the scoop...<br>
<b>Day 1</b>...I get a call to look into a possible sniper on a major freeway.  Going to the house I find his wife just out of the shower, she is wearing only a towel.  I cuff her and move on while she is yelling at me 
and calling me names.  I proceed to the attic, on my way up dispatch tells me he was seen in the attic window.  I proceed with caution...as I lean around the corner at the top of the stairs I see him.  He also sees me and fires a shot off from 
his hunting rifle.  I can not get a clean shot so I fire a rain of rounds through the wall towards his direction, I hear a satisfying grunt as he begins to scream for mercy.  Remember, this mission was never the same, sometimes he ran from me.  One time he was not home, and he came home as I searched the house.<br>
<b>Day 2</b>...I am issued a warrant on a hit and run suspect, his son lives with him and I am to use extreme caution.  I get to the house and proceed in the building through the den.  His son sees 
me and pulls out a pistol, as he does this his father runs down the hall (his father is unarmed).  The son fires a round at me and I hit him with three shots to the chest.  As the son screams his father turns around and runs to his dying son.  
When he gets there he grabs the pistol his son had and aims it at me, after yelling at him to drop it he eventually complies and I cuff him.  Another time I cuffed the son and he screamed "Dad, get out of the house!".<br>
You also  create an operative and that is the character you play in the game.  Mine is a male caucasian, with blue eyes, and even has my name on his jacket...it is etched across his back.  The training is done 
superb also.  A killhouse is provided along with a wealth of mission to practice.  The killhouse makes the one on Rogue Spear look like a cardboard box.  I have to tell you, go get this game, it is very realistic and my wife and I were both tripping at how good the graphics are.  Get ready for the most realistic first person tactical game you have ever played, because 
SWAT 3 is it.

I haven't returned to the console world very much ever since I got my first computer, but in this case I think I'll make an exception.  You don't have to be a avid wrestling watcher or even know a thing about who " THE ROCK " is to fully appreciate this game. This is a wrestling fans and console players dream come true, having all the wrestlers and events needed to suppress boredom. The makers of this game put a lot of time into making this, and I know a couple of friends who are gonna be seeing a lot more of me due to this release ( I don't think their girlfriends will be happy ). If you don't own a N64 make friends with someone who does,...and Mike and Vic make room on the couch!

Road rage has plagued this planet for quite some time...but never as much since 1976, or at least a few years ago, when so many people were playing Activision's Interstate ' 76. I know that there were a few people that couldn't separate the real world from that one...LIKE ME! Yes I too would sometimes think that I had a 70's sports car with twin machine guns mounted and a hellfire missile system on top and I could overtake the hundreds of cars between me and my destination. The original was fun and I'm sure this game will be as well. You can check out some of the story line <a href="http://www.activision.com/games/i82/">here</a> or just cruise for pics of the cars.

<!-- START POST -->
The mod that I am creating for Rogue Spear is finally coming all together.  I wanted to thank all the guys that have been helping test it and put it together.  
Harlech, Ronin, and Witness have been a huge help.  I also wanted to thank Mother.May.I for answer my questions.  Here is what you can expect when it comes 
out...Many New Realistic Weapons (the original weapons are included), Training Rounds, Training Uniforms, Convict Uniforms, SEAL Uniforms, SWAT Uniforms, a few 
fun multiplay maps, better sounds, a Mod Cleaner (fixes server modifications that stop you from joining), and enhanced graphics.  You can expect the mod to be released next week to the general public.<!-- END POST -->

I remember when I first played Half-Life, I was so enthralled by the game I literally was glued to my computer until I finished the game. It is one of my favorite single player games of all time, the story was so rich and my heart was racing 99% of the time trying to figure out how to get the next stage. It's appropriately titled Opposing Force, You are going to Black Mesa with your platoon ( that's right same story but you are on the military side this time! ), and have to bug out when you find out you are outmatched. You have the old character interaction such as guards and scientists, but also your fellow soldiers, medics can heal you, engineers can blowtorch open doors, etc. <a href="http://www.sierrastudios.com/games/opposingforce/">Here</a> is the official site.

 A few of <a href="http://www.janes.ea.com/">these</a> demos from Jane's. As USAF has exploded on the gaming scene, there are a few older games by Jane's that you might want to try. Most of the flight sims don't compare to USAF but you might want to give them a whirl. Fleet command looks interesting, and I personally enjoyed WW2 fighters, it is a different style and feel to the fast paced USAF but quite enjoyable.

Oni Review

<!-- START POST -->
For all the anime fans out there, I have a game for you to look at. You would think that <a href="http://www.bungie.com/">Bungie</a> would have their hands full with the release of <a href="http://halo.bungie.com/">HALO</a> (due out in march of Y2K), but they are looking to release Oni out by Christmas of '99. Oni is a 3d shooter based on the classic anime movies like Ghost In The Shell and Ninja Scroll from the anime pumping machine <a href="http://www.manga.com/">Manga</a>. With a higher emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, and built with a new engine I know that I am eagerly awaiting the game. The only downside looks to be the multiplayer aspect, even though it will more than likely be an option, the gameplay may suffer due to the animation aspect and it would be a laggy beast. Well a picture says a thousand words so to check out some of the screen shots or learn more about the game you can see for yourself by clicking <a href="http://oni.bungie.com/">here</a>.

I have been playing some great games lately and I just wanted to let everyone know what they are. The first title is as you all know <a href="http://www.janesusaf.com">USAF</a>, I will not say anything more about this 
title other than it is the best flight simulator I have played.  Another title I have been playing is <a href="http://www.shock2.com/index.html">System Shock 2</a> and this game is great, it is even spooky.  You are a 
military type individual who is assigned to an escort ship on the first "faster than light" flight into the unknown.  Well something goes wrong and you wake up out of cryo and have to piece it all 
together.  And I am always playing Rogue Spear...that is a no-brainer.  The last game I am playing is on the Playstation, it is <a href="http://www.activision.com/games/tonyhawk/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>.  I can sum this game up in one 
work..."WOW"!  The graphics, gameplay, and sound on this game are all awesome.  If you have a PSX and do not have this title then you need to get it.  I only get the best games for my PSX, some of 
my all time favorites are Tekken 3, Gran Turismo, Metal Gear Solid, Syphon Filter, and Tony Hawk.  OH, and I play Rogue Spear...did I say that earlier?

Quake 3 is still in is final stage of testing, and you can be a part of it. Just download the test at the site by clicking <a href="http://www.quake3arena.com/">here</a>. Or you can go to the site and check out the <a href="http://www.quake3arena.com/screenshots/index.html">screen shots</a>. From what I have heard Q3 has a lot of catching up to do, and that <a href="http://www.unrealtournament.net./shock/index2.htm">Unreal Tourney</a> has already got Q3 beat , just check out the site. Either one is gonna have to put up a good fight, but right now my vote is still for Rogue Spear!

DeckWraith's 2Mad Weapon Mod for Rogue Spear
<!-- END DATE -->

<!-- START POST -->
A visitor of the site sent me a great email, one of those that keep you motivated, he told me <a href="mailto:deckwraith@yahoo.com">DeckWraith</a> has put out a new mod called Mad2 Weapons.  This mod adds some incendiary weapons.  Incendiary ammo has white phosphorus in it, this stuff can burn through an engine block and the only way to put it out is to stop oxygen from getting 
to it...quite nasty when used on personnel.  The mod has seventeen weapons in all and they use the mod folder in Rogue Spear, so there is no fear of it not allowing you to join an unmodded server.  
You can direct <a href="files/rs/2madsetup.exe">download the file here</a>, or go visit <a href="http://www.surfhouston.com/2Mad/">www.surfhouston.com/2Mad/</a> for more information.
