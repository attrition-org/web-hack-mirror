<p>Speaking to a group of students in a Tehran girls school on the third day of the Ten
Day Dawn Ceremonies President Khatami said that women in an Islamic society were capable
of any achievement and that their active participation in social, cultural, political and
managerial fields had to be facilitated. <br>
</p>

<p>Khatami said women had made considerable achievements in various fields although they
did not have as many opportunities as men did.<br>
</p>

<p>Saying that Islam gave women all necessary rights he added, &quot;Nevertheless,
religious authorities can make further improvements. Changes in figh [Islamic
Jurisprudence] must take place regarding women's rights.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>Responding to a question by one of the girls regarding the generation gap, the
president said that adults must have faith in the youth and that generation gaps were
created when they persisted in imposing their views on the youth. <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The suppression of questioning creates psychological instability; our youth must
be allowed to pose their questions in a free environment.&quot; </p></font>
