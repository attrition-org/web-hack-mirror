    Mission of UNICEF:</font></strong> </p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>UNICEF</strong> is mandated by the Untied Nations General
    Assembly to advocate for the protection of children's rights, to help meet their basic
    needs and to expand their opportunities to reach their full potential. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>UNICEF</strong> is guided by the Convention on the Rights of
    the Child and strives to establish children's rights as enduring ethical principles and
    international standards of behaviourtowards children. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>UNICEF</strong> insists that the survival, protection and
    development of children are universal development imperatives that are integral to human
    progress. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>UNICEF</strong> mobilizes political will and material
    resources to help countries, particularly developing countries, ensure a&quot;first call
    for children&quot; and to build their capacity to form appropriate policies and deliver
    services for children and their families. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>UNICEF</strong> is committed to ensuring special protection
    for the most disadvantaged children - victims of war, disasters, extreme poverty, all
    forms of violence and exploitation and those with disabilities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>UNICEF</strong> responds in emergencies to protect the
    rights of children. In coordination with United Nations partners and humanitarian
    agencies, UNICEF makes its unique facilities for rapid response available to its partners
    to relieve the suffering of children and those who provide their care. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>UNICEF</strong> is non-partisan and its cooperation is free
    of discrimination. In everything it does, the most disadvantaged children and the
    countries in greatest need have priority. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>UNICEF</strong> aims, through its country programmes, to
    promote the equal rights of women and girls and to support their full participation in the
    political, social and economic development of their communities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>UNICEF</strong> works with all its partners towards the
    attainment of the sustainable human development goals adopted by the world community and
    the realization of the vision of peace and social progress enshrined in the Charter of the
    United Nations. </font></p>
