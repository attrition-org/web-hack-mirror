knew this was going to happen, didn't you? All of a sudden, one
day, everyone responsible for filling attrition.org's defacement
mirror was going to wake up and think.. 'hey, we should all get
together, and really stir up some shit' Well here it is, The Prophecy
being fulfilled. We don't have some deep political message, and
we don't care who you release from prison, we just don't have
anything better to do.. and you admins make it so easy. We dont
claim to be some elite hacking group, or to own the world, we're
just here to have fun. And fun we will have. <BR>
<BR>
Yes, that is right my friends. The top names of attrition have
finally united to make one ultimate 0wn1ng force. We are here,
and no one can stop us. To all who wish to join, you must find
us.</FONT></CENTER></P>
