<!--INSTRUCTIONS 

This is the template for messages that kTalk need to print to the 

user. Such as confirmation when a user is added etc.



This file is pure HTML, except for certain "magic comments" which are

substituted with other values when the scripts processes it.



IMPORTANT: They are shown here with the * character inside them. This is so that

kTalk does not process these examples. When actually using these, remove the *s.



<!-*-ktalk field message-*->: Here is where the message gets inserted.
