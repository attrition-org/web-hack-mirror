Rid(moduli), for being an understandable person with the balls to help
other's and not regret it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also would love to give greeting's
out to all the defacers out there doing what they have to do(don't give
a fuck on what anyone say's about you, we're all internet rebels here,
correct? then who care's, stop the flame wars)</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">I would also like to point out that
both me and ph0tek, are the FIRST *</font>
<br><font face="Courier New,Courier">.pr(puerto rico) defacers, the *.pr
TLD isn't even on attrition.org's defacement statistics, and we're proud
of that, us being Puerto Rican also made us pity such GARBAGE security
from a Puerto Rican host, shut down this bullshit, or learn some fucking
shit on how to run your server's properly, and atleast do weekly passwd
checks.</font>

<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000">Well well well,
Yes, we ARE going to bitch out against the U.S Government, and the Navy/marines
for doing warfare testing on the peaceful island of Puerto Rico, named
"</font><font color="#3333FF">Vieques</font><font color="#000000">", what
irritates me is that the U.S Government chose this island for warfare testing
not 1, 5, 10, 20, 30 or even 40 year's ago, but up to over 60 years.&nbsp;
Still till this day the Marines Warfare training(bombing, raiding, everything
in your imagination) is proceeding.&nbsp; Lately, local and even remote
Puerto Rican &amp; black and even white supporters are getting threatened
by the Marines that they will be arrested for <b>PEACEFULLY
</b>protesting
what <b>THEY </b>think is wrong(can you blame them?).</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000">The only attempt's
that our U.S government was to "offer" the "</font><font
color="#3333FF">Vieques</font><font color="#000000">"
Puerto Ricans if they would let them keep their warfare testing for a few
more year's in return for $40,000,000.&nbsp; Any stupid human could guess
that's basically a bribe to shutdown the local Puerto Rican's from even
causing the training to halt.&nbsp; Nothing else i can really say, unless
i keep on bitching on the issue, me, a minority defacer in the U.S won't
get anything done with this.&nbsp; I just hope something changes, Puerto
Ricans are human too, you treat Hawaii like king's, and Puerto Rico like
a second hand dildo.&nbsp; Give us the Respect that we deserve...or shall
we take it by force? cabron.</font></font>
