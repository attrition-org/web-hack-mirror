<u>Announcer suspended</u>
<p>
April 14, 2000
<p>
A radio announcer has been suspended after a sarcastic on-air apology to
Aborigines from other Australians.
<p>
"We feel that we must apologise for building hundreds of homes for you,
which you have vandalised and destroyed," said breakfast broadcaster
Olivia
Scott from central Queensland radio station 4RO, based at Rockhampton,
last
Friday.
<p>
"We apologise for giving you law and order, which has helped prevent you
from slaughtering one another.
<p>
"We apologise for working hard to pay the taxes that finance your welfare,
medical care, education et cetera to the tune of $10 billion a year."
<p>
Radio 4RO general manager Paul Sweeney said the broadcast showed an
appalling lack of judgment and sensitivity.

	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">

	Once more an Australian utilising their freedom of speech has been
cut down, like
	the rest of us, Olivia Scott suffers from a thing which is frowned
upon in Australia,
	it's called 'the truth'.  Now I know alot of you reading this will
be wondering what 
	the hell I'm talking about, so I'll help you out a little;

	  </p></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">	

	Australian aboriginies have, over the years, become more and more
demanding, to the point
	where over $10 billion per year is spent on their 'welfare', not
very many of them work, 
	and not very many of them want to work.  I know a few good 'black
fellahs' who have worked 
	all their life, and never exploited our welfare system, but
unfortunately alot arn't like that.

	  </p></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">	

	Recently they have been threatening our country with riots and
violence, saying all they want
	is an apology for us 'taking over their land'.  They don't seem to
remember that that was 200
	years ago, and that before them, there were other humans here,
promagnun man was arbitrarily
	exterminated, like a roach infestation, by the current
'aboriginies', but no one ever seems
	to mention this.

	  </p></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">	

	I have a strong feeling the reason no one speaks out is,
unfortunately in this trendy facist world,
	where everyone attempts to be 'politically correcter than thou',
if you ever speak out against someone
	and you happen to be white, no matter how relevant your point,
then you're instantly dismissed as a 
	racist.

	  </p></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">	

	So what has happened?  Anti-racism, ie: the word and oppinions of
white people are down trodden by
	even other white people, we have no freedom of speech in such
matters, and your average Australian's
	oppinion is ignored when it comes to sensationalistic media.  What
Olivia Scott said was true, but
	because she's not aboriginal, she must be a racist.

	  </p></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">	

	We have no mouths, but every day we're bombarded with what the
media want us to hear, and what the
	media want us to know, that's their form of ownership over this
country.  And unfortunately, alot
	of Australian's believe everything the media tells them, and
believe this is the country the media say.
	Actually, so does the rest of the world.  A friend in Canada was
talking to me recently about how brilliant
	he thought this country was, after I told him more about the place
he couldn't believe the lies he'd heard
	from the media and from our government.

	  </p></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">	

	We have no freedom of speech anymore.  But I can honestly say, we
are not sorry for what was done 200 years
	ago, because they're not sorry for making an entire species of
humans on this continent extinct.  We are not
	sorry for giving them money, for them never having to work
(legally, or morally), and for them destroying
	everything we create for them.

	  </p></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">	

	I work hard every day, 6 days a week, in an attempt to make a
living.  I don't get free money, I don't get
	free housing, I'm still quite young, and I work my arse off every
day.  But my oppinion is not important, 
	because I'm white.  I don't understand this.

	  </p></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">	

	What I do understand however is, we need the worlds attention on
these matters, our government are controlling
	the media, and the media is controlling the country.  We need
assistance.
