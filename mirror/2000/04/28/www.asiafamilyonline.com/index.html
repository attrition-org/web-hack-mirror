<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Book Antiqua">Hey buddy.

I don't know what your fucking problem is. Wiether it be that

time of the month for you or maybe your just too bored sitting

on your fat ass, but like i don't know why you wanna fucking step

up, talking shit without any backing. For fuck sakes, you email

me saying we are on windows, and we hack with frontpage, when

in fact thats a no for both. How could we hack this shit with

frontpage? Like why the fuck would I talk shit if I'm doing the

same thing? I'm not like that fagget. Stop fucking pissing people

off just because maybe your having a bad day. 'Nuff
said.</FONT></B></CENTER></P>


<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Book Antiqua">Thanks

to Sabu,n30(spell my name right :P) and everyone else who
recognizes!</FONT></B></CENTER></P>


<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Book Antiqua">Hey NAP

(New Age Pussies) wtf is your problem? Calling us a bunch of morons..

lol why do you say that? Is it out of jealousy? Or maybe cause

you ph33r worse then one of these stupid ass korean admins? Well

whatever it is, shut up. Hacking a frontpage box, then insulting

us isn't a way of trying to punk us off. Hack something worthwhile,

then maybe we'll listen.</FONT></B></CENTER></P>


<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Book Antiqua">Artech,

if your so good, why don't you re-hack this page? like you did

with warezx. And then you talking shit saying I &quot;brute forced&quot;

it when i ran a simple exploit to overflow the buffer on the serv-u

ftp. Rehacking is gay, but saying that I did it using a no-skill

technique is even worse.</FONT></B></CENTER></P>


<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Book Antiqua">Big welcome

back to #rootworm. Glad to see you back boys, bring back the old

skewl :)</FONT></B></CENTER></P>
