<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I wanted to do
this hack to express my feelings on all the wannabe's out there.
everyone know the &quot;good&quot; hacker neoh, right? it seems
as if he's just a dos kiddie and a lame person, all around. not
to mention he's still in the days of taking over chans. lame.
check out this... here's an </font><a
href="http://www.b0red.com/week1/week1.html"><font size="2"
face="Verdana">article</font></a><font size="2" face="Verdana">
he supposely wrote on the TLS handshake protocol. and </font><a
href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2246.txt"><font size="2"
face="Verdana">here's</font></a><font size="2" face="Verdana">
the RFC to it.. if you compare them, you see he just copied shit
off the RFC to make his own &quot;article&quot;. thats called
plagarism, and a lame attempt to look like he knows something.
even on his &quot;overview&quot;, he has things copied, except
for the first 2 lines. i bet this boy dont even know what a
protocol is. how lame neoh.... how lame. you should be ashamed of
yourself. bad boy. embarassed? i think it would be wise to take
down that nice article soon. &quot;:]&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana">oh yeah....neoh....dont
try to rehack this to hide the embarassment, that would be even
more lame.</font></p>
