This Web site was not defaced in the purest sense of the word. 
Coolio "poisoned" the DNS information and pointed to a defaced
University site in the country of Colombia. At no point was
the RSA web site breached or altered. However, when visitors
typed in "www.rsa.com" into the browser, they did NOT see RSA's
page.
