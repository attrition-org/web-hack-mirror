<ul>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">'rupeesaver' will limit itself only to <u>branded consumer products</u>.
  Products where prices can be well defined. Initially, consumer durables and electronics
  will be introduced and eventually 'rupeesaver' would want to become a shopping mall of
  high quality, branded products and services.</font> </p>

<ul>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">So that more and more Internet users could become the members of
  'rupeesaver'. More members would mean more demands. More demands would mean more and more
  manufacturers and dealers would want to offer their products and services to the members
  of 'rupeesaver'. In whole, making 'rupeesaver' the ideal platform for buyers and sellers
  to meet.</font> </p>
</ul>
<b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="dealer">Why</a> should manufacturers and dealers offer attractive rates to
'rupeesaver'?</font></b>

<ul>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Frankly they have no other option if they really are keen in getting
  your business. None of the participating manufacturers and dealers will know the price that
  has been quoted by their competitors. 'rupeesaver' has been programmed in a way to show
  only those offers that are the lowest for that particular brand and the model. Yes, you
  have guessed it right. To beat the competition, the manufacturers and the dealers are
  likely to quote the bare minimum. The market forces will work to 'rupeesaver' member's
  advantage. And that's the essence of 'rupeesaver'.</font> </p>
</ul>

<b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">How does 'rupeesaver' bring in authenticity to the various offers it receives?</font></b>

<ul>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">All participating dealers and manufacturers will have to quote their
  offers in writing along with their terms and conditions, if any. Our executives will
  collect the information periodically and update the same for your benefit.</font></p>
</ul>
<b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Is 'rupeesaver' bargaining on our behalf?</font>
</b>

<ul>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">No. It is just compiling the information for you. It's in the
  supplier's own interest to quote their best price. However, we will always
  look out to better the prices than those offered by other web sites and non-'rupeesaver'
  dealers. In short we want 'rupeesaver' to offer rock-bottom prices to the best
  of our abilities.</font></p>
