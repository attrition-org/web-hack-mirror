The Interpower International Power Source provides a low-cost, convenient
source of 50Hz power at the various operating voltages found around the world
(typically 220-240VAC/50Hz) which is important for testing many products that
are exported. <BR>
<BR>
At 30 pounds (13.6kg), the International Power Source is sufficiently portable
that it can be easily moved between work stations or lab positions as needed.
Output power is delivered through either a standard US 15A/115VAC socket or the
Continental European &quot;Schuko&quot;/CEE 7 socket. <BR>
<BR>
Output voltages are selected at 100V, 115V, 220V, 230V, or 240V(<U>+</U>10%).
Frequencies can be selected at 50 or 60Hz, &#177;3Hz. This flexibility permits
testing of products with varying input voltages and frequencies. Real world
power mains conditions, such as undervoltage (&quot;brown out&quot;),
overvoltage, and the effect of different frequencies, are easily simulated.
<BR>
<BR>
The power rating of the International Power Source is 1250VA. This new model is
designed to accommodate US input voltage of 115V, supplied through a cordset
rated at 20A that consists of a NEMA 5-20 plug and an IEC 60320 sheet C19
connector. It can also be configured for 230 or 240 input power by equipping it
with an international cordset for overseas applications. <BR>

overseas...</B> <BR>
<BR>
Your overseas customer expects your product to work when it is unpacked from
the box. Designing a product with your international customer in mind is good
for customer relations and gives you a competitive advantage: when customers
are satisfied with your product, they are more likely to buy your products
again and recommend them to others. <BR>
<BR>
These considerations should be addressed for the convenience of your
international customers: <BR>
<BR>
<B>Use the correct plug/socket standard:</B><BR>
There are currently nine common (3-wire) plug and socket standards used
internationally. Equip your product with the correct plug for the country to
which your product will be exported. Be sure to equip your product with the
necessary cables and connectors so your customer won't have to find adapters or
otherwise modify your product before use. Harmonized cordage is required on
products being exported to Europe. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Set your product at the correct voltage and frequency:</B> <BR>
European voltages are typically 230VAC/50Hz for Europe and 240VAC/50Hz in
Australia. Select the correct fuse type: International and North American fuse
specifications and sizes differ. Use an IEC 60127 (5 x 20mm) fuse so that your
international customer will be able to purchase replacement fuses. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Design your product to meet the correct international standards:</B><BR>
Make sure your product meets all applicable safety standards: for example,
according to EMC Directive 89/336/EEC, equipment sold in Europe after January
1, 1997 must carry the CE mark. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Test your product at international voltages and frequencies:</B> Testing at
your customer's voltage and frequency prior to shipment assures that your
equipment will work when it finally reaches your overseas customer. <BR>
<BR>
The International Power Source allows you to simulate field conditions
(high-line and low-line voltages) on prototypes. Fluctuations in frequency can
also be simulated. By testing during the design process, the manufacturer can
save costly modifications after the product is in production, and avoid costly
failures, field repairs, and/or returns. </FONT> </TD>
