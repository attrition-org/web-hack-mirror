Assemblies</FONT></B><BR>
In most cases, power cords and cordsets assembled in our shop meet the
requirements of national safety agencies. Compliance with these requirements
falls into the following three levels:</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="425"> <OL>
<LI>Third-world countries don't enforce standards. Cord assemblies should
employ components compatible with prevalent usage in a given country. Assembly
should be done in accordance with good standard practice.</LI>
<LI>Most industrialized countries have written standards which require the use
of approved components. The standards may also indicate some preferred assembly
and testing methods.</LI>
<LI>In North America, UL and CSA require both the use of listed and certified
components and periodic on-site inspections of the assembly operation to verify
that approved procedures are being followed.</LI>
</OL>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2">Where possible, we have chosen components which
meet the three levels of compliance listed above. In addition, we follow
standard assembly and testing practices and guidelines which satisfy all three
levels. Finally, we can produce detachable and non-detachable cords per UL 817
and CSA 22.2 No. 21-M1984. When an assembly meets all agency requirements, we
can mark the packaging with UL and CSA labels. <BR>

This section is an extension of the <A HREF="catalog/cords.htm">cord and
cordsets</A> section of the catalog. The standards for cords, plugs, sockets,
power inlets, and power outlets vary by nation. The information in the cordsets
section is needed to make good selections in this section, but it is not
repeated here. Additional information can be found in the <A
HREF="guide.htm">plug and socket</A> section, and the power module and inlet
section. <BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="425"> <B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Advantages of Standard
Cords</FONT></B><BR>
The cords in the International / North American Cords and Cordsets section are
the best value; use them when you can. They offer several advantages over those
in this section: First, they are less expensive than made-to-order cords.
Second, we try to maintain a good stock of the standard products so that you
won't need to wait so long for your orders to be filled. Third, they are made
with molded-on plugs and connectors. This makes them better for at least three
reasons: <OL>
<LI>They can use crimp connections which are more secure and reliable than
screw terminals.</LI>
<LI>Because these connections are surrounded by PVC, they are just about
tamper-proof.</LI>
<LI>Last, they look clean and solid.</LI>
</OL>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2">When you can't find just what you need among our
standard cords, this section will help you specify made-to-order cords and
cordsets that meet your exact needs. Here you will find more options from which
to choose. Cords of any reasonable length can be made. In many cases, higher
current ratings are available. In addition, we can prepare power cord ends in
many ways (special strip lengths, barrel crimp, ring and flag terminals) to
help you hook them up to your other primary components.</TD>

<FONT COLOR="#0080FF"><B>Standard Components</B></FONT><BR>
We use a group of standard parts to make our made-to-order cords because this
helps us do a better job for you. We keep these parts in stock, which allows us
to turn your orders around quickly, giving you a high level of service. Also,
since our assembly people work with the same parts and tooling often, they can
make consistently high quality cords for you. <BR>
