      <li>PRESENTATION OF THE INVESTMENT LAW </b></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Law N' 91- 048/AN-RM dated February 26, 199 1, and Decree N' 91-079 P-RM dated March 4,
    1991 has instituted the investment law that is presently in force in Mali. </p>
    <p>It shall abrogate and replace law N' 86-39/AN- RM dated March 8, 1986. </p>
    <p>The Investment Law shall institute a preferential tax system with a view to promote
    national as well as foreign private capital investment in the activities of production and
    service fees, and shall offer the necessary guarantees for giving security to investments
    realized. </p>
    <p><u>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Systems of Approval </u></p>
    <p>Three systems of approval shall be provided for in the present Investment Law, that is:
    <ul>
      <i>
      <li>A System</i> called system of small and medium-sized firms. It shall apply to
        investments whose amount is inferior to 100 million CFA Francs (1 million French Francs). </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <i>
      <li>B System</i>, called system of large which shall apply to investments superior or equal
        to 100 million CFA Francs. </li>
      <li>The system called <i>system of Free Zones</i>, which shall apply to new firms dealing
        mainly with exports which can sell off up to 20% of their production on the national
        market. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><u>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Advantages Granted </u></p>
    <p>Firms, which are accepted by the Investment Law, shall enjoy the following tax
    shelters: <ol>
      <li>Exemption from taxes on industrial and Commercial profits (tax on Bic) and license fees.
        The duration of this exemption shall be 5 years as far as A System is concerned and 8
        years as far as B System in concerned. </li>
      <li>Exemption from tax on land income 'and tax on &quot;*Les biens de main morte&quot;
        concerning new constructions. The duration of this exemption shall be 5 years for A and B
        Systems. The duration shall be 10 years concerning property development project firms. </li>

        companies and exemption from these fees in case of the increase of capital. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Accepted firms in the system called system of free zones, shall enjoy total and
    permanent exemption from fee and taxes relative to the practice of their activities.
    However, they shall be authorized to sell 20% of their production on the national market
    by paving off duties and taxes normally owed. </p>
    <p>Take-overs so as to discharge public firms by new promoters within the framework of the
    privatization program of public firms, can, according to the amount of investment, enjoy
    the advantages of A System or B System. </p>
    <p>The setting up of industries in the regions shall be encouraged through the extension
    of the tax exemption period on industrial&nbsp; and commercial profits and license fees.
    The Decree of implementation of the law shall specified&nbsp;&nbsp; three geographical
    zones of which Bamako District constitutes Zone I. Concerning Zone III (Koulikoro Sikasso
    and Segou Region), the period of exemption from taxes on industrial and commercial profits
    and license fees shall be extended to two years. (Mopti Toumbouctou, Gao and Kidal Region)
    this extension shall be four years.</p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Guarantees </b></p>
    <p>Foreign investment shall enjoy the same preferential rights as national investors. </p>
    <p>The right to capital transfer and its income shall be guaranteed to individual or legal
    entities that make in Mali an investment funded by a contribution of foreign exchange. In
    other words, foreign persons who proceed to investment or who hold a job in a Malian firm,
    shall have the right, subject to compliance with regulating on matters of exchange, to
    transfer, in the foreign exchange sold at the time of the constitution, of the said
    investments, the dividends, products of any nature of invested capital, products of
    liquidation or of the realization of their assets and salaries.* </p>
    <p>Disputes, which could arise between foreign investors and the Government, shall be
    settled first through an amicable procedure, or within the frame- work of bilateral
    agreements for protecting foreign investments. In case of failure, the parties shall have
    recourse to the arbitration procedure which shall be the one provided for by the March 18,
    1965 Agreement creating the International Center for Settling Disputes Relative to
    Investment among States and Nationals from other States (CIRDI), established under the
    aegis of the World Bank and ratified by Mali on January 3, 1978. </p>
    <p>Approval by Investment Law is equally worth the investment approval for granting any
    guarantee in the spirit of article 15 from the Treaty instituting the Multilateral Agency
    for Guaranteeing Investments (AMGI), signed by Mali in October 1990. </p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Appraisal Criteria of Projects at Approval </b></p>
    <p>The rate of added value, which has to be equal of superior to 35%, shall be the only
    fundamental element for appraising projects. </p>
    <p>No minimum level of investment is required for a project to be eligible to the law. </p>
