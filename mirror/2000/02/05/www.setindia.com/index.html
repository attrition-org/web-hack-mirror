The man was stopped by an Indian army patrol 10 yards from his house, 20
minutes after curfew - his house had no toilet. Just before sunrise the
next day , his battered corpse was dumped in front of his house. Permission
for a proper funeral was refused, arrangements were made for a burial in
a local park. The women blocked the entrance of the park from the Indian
Army who were trying to stop the ceremony.</font></font></font>

Indian security forces in Kashmir have systematically violated the Code
of Medical Neutrality in Armed Conflict. During the curfew the security
forces have prevented medical personnel from evacuating injured people
in need of treatment. Ambulance drivers have been the principal victims
of these actions, frequently being stopped while on duty. A number have
been fired on and beaten, in some cases the medical personnel have been
detained, tortured and killed.</font></font></font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#999900"><font size=-1>Torture
is widely practiced in Kashmir as a means of extracting information from
detainees, coercing confessions, punishing persons believed sympathetic
to the militants and creating a climate of political repression. Torture
includes severe methods, which include the psycho-torture: soldiers rape
the detainee's wife in front of his eyes.</font></font></font>
