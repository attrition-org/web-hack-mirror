<p>Faculty and Staff of the College of Biology and Agriculture: </p>

<p>The purpose of this memo is to inform you of a new program of preventive maintenance
offered by our office. This memo will discuss the details of this program and the reasons
for implementing this program. </p>

<p>We, the CSR's of the BioAg college, will perform the maintenance on all the computers
in your department. We will visit your office and/or lab(s) and run several programs on
your computer(s), and open up each computer to dust out the interior. The programs to be
run are ViruSafe virus scan, Scandisk, Norton Utilities (NU) Speeddisk, NU Windoctor, and
NU Optimizer. </p>

<p>The reason for running virus scan is obvious. </p>

<p>Scandisk corrects any hard drive errors. Sometimes the operating system leaves files on
the hard drive that are left there when a computer is not shut down properly. Scandisk can
help find and erase these files, thus improving system performance by freeing hard disk
space. </p>

<p>NU Speeddisk organizes all the files physically on a hard drive so that when a program
runs, the files are all in order so that access time is decreased and programs load more
quickly. It is comparable to Windows Defrag. </p>

<p>Windoctor and Optimizer refine the windows setup file (the registry) and other aspects
of Windows. </p>

<p>Dusting out a computer reduces the risk of short circuiting (because of moisture
build-up in the dust) in the computer, and also allows for the components to run at cooler
temperatures, thereby increasing performance. </p>

<p>If for any reason you do NOT want your computer to be involved in this program, please
respond to this message via email at <a HREF="mailto:wiggin@byu.edu">wiggin@byu.edu</a> or
<a HREF="mailto:danny@byu.edu">danny@byu.edu</a> and tell us. </p>

<p>PLEASE BACK UP ANY IMPORTANT DATA FILES ON YOUR COMPUTER. We won't run these programs
before your computer is backed up or without your consent. If you need any help backing up
your system, we'll teach you how. </p>

<p>Yours Truly, <br>

Assistant CSR <br>
