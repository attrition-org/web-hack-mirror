<br><br>Deception in Self-Humiliation by Nietzsche.<br>
Through your irrational behavior you have done your neighbor great harm and destroyed an&nbsp;<br>
irrecoverable happiness and then you subdue your vanity sufficiently to go to him, expose your irrationality to his contempt and believe that after this painful and to you very difficult scene everything has again been put to rights.&nbsp;<br>
that your voluntary loss of honor compensates for his involuntary loss of happiness:&nbsp;<br>
suffused with this feeling you go away uplifted and restored in your virtue. But your neighbor is still as unhappy as he was before, he derives no consolation from the fact that you are irrational and have admitted it, he even remembers the painful sight of you pouring contempt upon yourself before him as a fresh injury for which he has to thank you.<br>
But he has no thought of revenge and cannot grasp how you could in any way compensate him.&nbsp;<br>
At bottom that scene you performed was performed before yourself and for the sake of yourself:&nbsp;<br>
you invited in a witness of it, again for your own sake and not for his do not deceive yourself!<br>

<br>Irresponsible Hate Anthem<br>
I am so all-American, I'd sell you suicide<br>
I am totalitarian, I've got abortions in my eyes<br>
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper<br>
I am the animal who will not be himself<br>
fuck it!<br>
Hey victim, should I black your eyes again?<br>
Hey victim,<br>
you were the one who put the stick in my hand<br>
I am the ism, my hate's a prism<br>
let's just kill everyone and let your God sort them out<br>
fuck it!<br>
Everybody's someone else's nigger/I know you are so am I<br>
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers/<br>
I don't need to choose a side<br>
I better, better, better, better not say this<br>
better, better, better, better not tell<br>
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper<br>
I am the idiot who will not be himself<br>
fuck it!<br>
