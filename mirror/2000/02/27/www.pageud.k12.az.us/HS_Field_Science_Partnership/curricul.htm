<p align="center">FIELD SCIENCE PARTNERSHIP CURRICULUM</b> <b>INTRODUCTION</b> </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In May 1996, the Page Unified School District requested
funds from the Arizona Community Foundation to begin the development of a partnership with
the National Park Service at Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (GCNRA).&nbsp; At the
same time, National Park Service officials submitted funding requests to the National
Parks Foundation and the Parks and Classrooms program to provide matching funds for the
development of the partnership.&nbsp; The primary goal of this partnership would be to
increase student learning for district students while at the same time enhancing research
activities within the Recreation Area. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above mentioned entities approved the funding in late 1996 and in
February 1997, the Park Service employed an Educational Specialist.&nbsp; The position
description for the Specialist specifically identifies the program goal as a primary
function. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program is developing into an exciting learning opportunity for
students.&nbsp; Two major research projects are now in place.&nbsp; Students collect water
on a regular rotating time schedule from Lake Powell and are learning how to test that
water for various microorganisms.&nbsp; Students are also monitoring an experimental
population of endangered razorback suckers that are being raised in City of Page Golf
Course ponds.&nbsp; Future plans call for a third research project that will involve
students in the development of a Park Service policy to manage range uses within the
Recreation Area. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A request for further funding is currently under consideration by the
National Park Service.&nbsp; These funds will be used to expand the availability of
program activities to students outside of the immediate area.&nbsp; Field trips of three
to five days are envisioned, with students performing a variety of hands-on learning
activities while visiting Lake Powell and the Glen Canyon area. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This document is an effort to consolidate and identify the current
status of the curriculum in use by students in the partnership.&nbsp; This document will
become the model for development of other curriculum topics used in the project. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Field Science Partnership is currently developing two major
science projects.&nbsp; These are the Lake Powell Water Quality Monitoring Program and
rearing of an experimental population of endangered razorback suckers.&nbsp; These
projects allow students to work closely with National Park Service personnel and other
scientists from the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, Arizona
Fish and Game, Utah Division of Wildlife Resources and the City of Page.&nbsp; An outline
of each of the projects is included below. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p><u>Lake Powell Water Quality Monitoring Program</u> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Park Service has collected data since the filling of
Lake Powell in the 1960&#146;s to determine levels of dangerous bacteria that may be
present in the water near heavily used beaches on the lake.&nbsp; In the past, levels have
exceeded safety margins leading to closures of some beaches and canyons to recreation
activities.&nbsp; Student participation in this activity will allow the Park Service to
increase the number and frequency of water sampling and allow them to better predict
trends that may appear. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p><u>Razorback Sucker Project</u> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1996, the National Park Service placed an experimental population
of an endangered fish, the razorback sucker into two local golf course ponds owned by the
City of Page.&nbsp; The objective is to raise the fish to an appropriate size to decrease
the probability of predation from non-natives and release them into the San Juan arm of
Lake Powell.&nbsp; The fish were netted from the ponds and released into the San Juan
River in April of 1998.&nbsp; A new population of fingerlings replaced these in December
of 1998 and are currently being monitored.&nbsp; The students are involved in projects
that monitor the water quality, the size and health of the fish.&nbsp; Students are also
involved in mapping projects and in studying the environmental systems that effect the
ponds.&nbsp; Since the water is reclaimed from the city&#146;s water treatment plant,
students gain knowledge about water reclamation, Department of Water Quality standards and
safety standards not normally found in a high school lab.&nbsp; The need to determine
ideal release locations for future populations will allow student participants to travel
extensively within a 150 mile radius of Page, often by boat or even airplane. </p>
