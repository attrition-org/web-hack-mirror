A hacker is a person intensely interested in the arcane and recondite<br>
workings of any computer operating system. Most often, hackers are<br>
programmers. As such, hackers obtain advanced knowledge of operating<br> 
systems and programming languages. They may know of holes within<br> 
systems and the reasons for such holes. Hackers constantly seek<br> 
further knowledge, freely share what they have discovered,<br> 
and never, ever intentionally damage data.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A cracker is a person who breaks into or<br> 
otherwise violates the system integrity of<br> 
remote machines, with malicious intent. Crackers, having gained<br> 
unauthorized access, destroy vital data, deny legitimate users service,<br>
or basically cause problems for their targets. Crackers can easily be<br> 
identified because their actions are malicious.<br>

Pity the media dont know the difference.
