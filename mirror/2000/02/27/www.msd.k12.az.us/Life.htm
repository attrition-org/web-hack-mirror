<P>These are two supplemental programs that play very crucial roles in
the curriculum. Both of these programs involve the higher level thinking
skills of synthesis, analysis, and evaluation. Topics such as building
self-esteem, understanding oneself, being an independent thinker, making
good decisions, and considering the consequences of one’s behavior are
challenging issues for discussion. The focus of both subjects is to assist
all children in developing &quot;survival&quot; skills which will help
them to grow into happier, healthier and more productive adults.</P>
