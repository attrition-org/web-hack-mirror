<p><strong>The Murphy Elementary School District No. 21 of Maricopa County, Arizona is
located at 2615 West Buckeye Road in Phoenix, Arizona. According to available records, the
district was organized on September 16, 1886.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Murphy School District began in a bunkhouse on the James T. Murphy Ranch,
located just west of what is now 27th Avenue and south of Buckeye Road. In the early days,
ranchers often provided a school for their children and their workers' children. In 1886,
Mr. Murphy donated the land for a school. (see map below)</strong></p>

<p><strong>The first Murphy School was a one-room schoolhouse, with one teacher serving 48
students, ages six to eighteen. Records indicate that the first teachers included Jennie
Boatman, Winifred Hall, Ada Rebstock and Jenia L. Todd.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In 1912, a school building was built on the southeast corner of Buckeye Road
and 27th Avenue. This original Murphy No. 1 School was in continuous use through the late
1970's. In 1981, after attempts to receive historical foundation restoration funds failed,
the building was demolished.</strong></p>

<p><strong>One of the earliest principals of Murphy School No. 1 was Clyde J. Hinton, who
also taught 7th and 8th grades. he served Murphy School in the 1920's. Mr. Charles Bill
served as principal until 1940 when Mr. William R. Sullivan became principal. At the time,
Arizona law required a district to operate more than one school in order to assign the
title of Superintendent. When a second school opened in 1949, Mr. Sullivan became
Superintendent.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The second school was known as Murphy No. 2 and was eventually renamed W.R.
Sullivan School in honor of the former superintendent.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jack Lindstrom became principal of Murphy School No. 1 in 1949 and became
superintendent in 1970. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Murphy School No. 3 was opened in 1954. Mr. Sullivan recalled that the site
development for Murphy No. 3 required putting together several pieces of land. It was
built primarily because of the influx of students from the Coffelt Housing Project.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mr. Sullivan also indicated that volunteer labor from the community contributed
greatly in the development of baseball fields and other school sites.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In 1976, Dr. David M. Salopek became Superintendent. He was originally hired to
access federal funding such as Bilingual Education, Migrant Education, Indian Education,
Summer Youth Employment and Head Start. These programs are still in existence today.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In 1979, Dr. Alejandro Perez became Superintendent. He found that several
buildings in the district were beyond repair and unsafe for children. Dr. Perez developed
a five-year building program for which district voters approved a $3.9 million bond issue.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Many old buildings were demolished, new buildings were built and others were
remodeled.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The student population continued to grow. As a result, Dr. Perez recommended
the building of a fourth school. In 1985, voters approved a $5 million bond issue to build
the new school and a district field house.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In 1986, the governing board approved the name of the new school as Jack L.
Kuban Elementary School in honor of a former custodian who returned to school, obtained a
teaching degree and taught at Sullivan School for many years. At the same time, the
Governing board also renamed two other schools in the district. Murphy No. 1 was renamed
the Alfred F. Garcia Elementary School, in honor of a former Governing Board President and
community member, Alfred F. Garcia. <br>
Murphy No.3 was renamed the Arthur M. Hamilton Elementary School, honoring Arizona's House
Minority Leader Arthur M. Hamilton who attended W.R. Sullivan School as a younger and
served Murphy's legislative district in the Arizona House of Representatives.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In 1986, Dr. Robert I. Donofrio was appointed Superintendent. Dr. Donofrio has
previously served as the Assistant Superintendent, Director of the Exceptional Student
Program, Director of Federal Programs, Director of Instructional Services and as a special
education teacher at the former Murphy School No. 3.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Today, Murphy School District No. 21 is a fully integrated elementary district
offering a wide variety of programs to meet its diverse student population. Such programs
as bilingual education, migrant education, Title I, Head Start and other federally and
state-funded programs allow students opportunities to grow to their fullest capacities.</strong></p>
