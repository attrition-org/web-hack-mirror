<P>To encourage attendance and academic success, the Truancy Program implemented
a point system that focuses on rewarding students’ positive qualities.
Students earn points for daily attendance and grade improvement. Points
are exchanged for tangible items such as pencils, ink pens, notebooks,
and commodities including T-shirts, bath towels, and personal items. Not
only does the student benefit from receiving school supplies or needed
commodities, but they are instilled with the satisfaction of earning something
and taking pride in their accomplishment.</P>
