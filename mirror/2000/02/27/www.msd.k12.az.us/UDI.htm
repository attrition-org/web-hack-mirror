<P>This is a mentoring program established by United Development, Inc.
There are 20 male students involved in this program. The mentors come onto
campus every Wednesday from 1:10 p.m. to 2:10 p.m. The purpose is to provide
both educational and work related activities that support and encourage
the young men to stay in school. They also provide real work experiences
that support the student's educational goals. A Saturday program has been
established dividing activities between education and work experience.</P>
