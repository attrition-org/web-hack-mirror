<P>&quot;Running Start&quot; is for all first graders to participate in
a Reading Challenge to read 21 books in a given period of time. School
or classroom Rallies are held to recognize those students who meet the
challenge of reading 21 books. Books are given to the students to take
home and keep. For school year 1996-97, we will be serving approximately
571 students.</P>
