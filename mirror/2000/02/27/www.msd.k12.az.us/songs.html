<p align="center">WHEN YOU WISH <br>
UPON A STAR<br>
MAKES NO DIFFERENCE<br>
WHO YOU ARE<br>
ANYTHING<br>
YOUR HEART DESIRES<br>
WILL COME TO YOU<br>
IF YOUR HEART<br>
IS IN YOUR DREAM<br>
YOUR REQUEST<br>
IS TO EXTREME<br>
WHEN YOU WISH<br>
UPON A STAR<br>
AS DREAMERS DO</p>

<p align="center">FATE IS KIND SHE BRINGS<br>
TO THOSE WHO LOVE<br>
THE SWEET FULFILMENT OF<br>
THEIR SECRET LONGING</p>

<p align="center">LIKE A BOLT<br>
OUT OF THE BLUE <br>
FATE STEPS IN<br>
AND SEES YOU THROUGH<br>
WHEN YOU WISH<br>
UPON A STAR<br>
YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE<br>
(...REPEAT LAST SECTION ONE MORE TIME).</p>

<b><u><a HREF="http://members.aol.com/wdwjoe/midi/smalwrld.mid">Song #2 Click here for
sound </a>IT'S SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL<br>
</u></b>IT'S A WORLD OF LAUGHTER<br>
A WORLD OF TEARS<br>
IT'S A WORLD OF HOPES<br>
IT'S A WORLD OF FEARS<br>
IT'S SO MUCH THAT WE SHARE<br>
THAT IT'S TIME WE'ER AWARE<br>
IT'S A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL<br>
IT'S A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL<br>
IT'S A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL<br>
IT'S A SMALL SMALL WORLD <br>
THERE'S JUST ONE MOON<br>
AND ONE GOLDEN SUN<br>
AND A SMILE MEANS FRIENDSHIP<br>
TO EVERYONE<br>
THOUGH THE MOUNTAIN DIVIDE<br>
AND THE OCEANS ARE WIDE<br>
IT'S A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL<br>
IT'S A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL<br>
IT'S A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL<br>
IT'S A SMALL SMALL WORLD...</p>
