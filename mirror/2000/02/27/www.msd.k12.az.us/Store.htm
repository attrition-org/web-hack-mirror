<P>Southwest Supermarket, Circle K, Fleming Foods and Holsum Bakery have
established a mini-store on campus. Students earn Wildcat Bucks for good
attendance, completing assignments, promptness and good citizenship. Students
write checks against their account to purchase products mutually selected
by the student and their family. Students develop self-esteem, a sense
of contributing to their family and learn sound financial practices.</P>
