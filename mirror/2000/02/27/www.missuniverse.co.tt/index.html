<p align="center">here to say that world still hasn't secured their
computers, and probably never will.</p>
<p align="center">Also, Brazilians can't hack, they only FP. Also, if you have
got something to say to me, do it in English and not Portuguese, coz I fucking
hate that.</p>
<p align="center">For the rest: All you Crime Boys and OHB'ers fucking suck. I'm
on the net for 5 minutes and I get this FP site, you redeface a site 6 times:
learn first before you go showing off your lame skills. And it also sucks bad
ass that you guys can't speak English. I don't live in an English speaking
country, but I can speak it, so why can't you? Brazil isn't exactly the middle
of the world you know!</p>

<p align="center">a talk with a dumb FP'er. At least he knew English.<br>
> = him.<br>
(he did: www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/2000/02/25/www.lgenterprises.threadnet.com/ )<br>
<br>
>can u tell me something?<br>
>how i can get the fp password when you receive a 403<br>
<br>
you don't.<br>
<br>
>you can't get the password?<br>
<br>
not then.<br>
<br>
>you know where can i get good txts about fp vulnerabilities?<br>
<br>
I guess you read my text right?<br>
<br>
>i'm gonna get that<br>
<br>
Open up Windows Explorer, in the left tree directory you'll see a map called Web Folders at the bottom of the list<br>
In the case of FP98:<br>
start program, choose: open web.<br>
then type in name and hit: list webs<br>
<br>
>that trick i know<br>
>but i never founded a server who don't ask for a password<br>
<br>
:) I'll find you a .br site that doesn't as for it.<br>
<br>
>ok<br>
>it's hard.........<br>
>and some say that use an authentication scheme (ntlm) that is unsupported by frontpage<br>
<br>
sometimes that happens, but I'll find you a .br site in 10 minutes<br>
<br>
>ok.......<br>
>do it<br>
<br>
http://www.sct.ce.gov.br/<br>
This shit is too simple.<br>
<br>
>hehe<br>
>it works<br>
>did u have a scanner or something like that to find vulnerable hosts?<br>
<br>
no.<br>
Just a search engine,<br>
and that's why I think people like Crime Boys and OHB are so fucking gay and why everyone hates Brazilian defacers:<br>
one they can't hack even though they want to (no offense)<br>
and almost none can speak english.<br>
<br>
>ok<br>
>what search engine ?<br>
>altavista, lycos?<br>
># little note: they can't do ANYTHING alone for some reason. :) #<br>
just find your own!<br>
<br>
>the last question<br>
>for what u search?<br>
>_vti_inf?<br>
_vti_pvt?<br>
<br>
Something.<br>
<br>
>ok<br>
>please tell me just that<br>
<br>
_vti<br>
btw: if I see you send that .gov to Attrition, I'll be pissed<br>
<br>
>hehe<br>
>why not?<br>
>attrition is c00l<br>
>and i put a password on that host<br>
>and a gr33tz to u<br>
<br>
Coz Attrition is lame because of all the FPing Brazilians now.<br>
I hacked the Michigan USA Government website with FP! And I didn't put that up did I?<br>
www.state.mi.us btw.<br>
# otherwise Attrition rocks! I love to see all the non NT defacements #<br>
>_vti_btw ??<br>
<br>
no.<br>
<br>
>_vti what?<br>
>please dude<br>
<br>
just _vti !<br>
coz that automatically does _vti_pvt _vti_cnf _vti_inf and all.<br>
so fuck off now, coz if you're too dumb for that, leave me alone.<br>
I helped you to the best of my powers.<br>
but YOU have to figure things out by yourself to.<br>
<br>
>hehe<br>
# then the idiot grins. #<br>
>i've decided not to hack that site<br>
<br>
ok, Why?<br>
<br>
>because u get that host<br>
>and i have to find my own hosts to hack ok?<br>
<br>
right!<br>
<br>
>and no one can access that site<br>
>i put a password protection<br>
<br>
:) Nice.<br>
<br>
>i'm looking on altavista<br>
>on advanced search for: link:"/_vti_pvt/"<br>
#why in the hell do I care? #<br>
ok<br>
<br>
>did u want account on any xxx site?<br>
<br>
no<br>
<br>
