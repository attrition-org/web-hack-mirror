This is not hacking. Personally I think defacing websites is very lame..
especially this.. uhh it's not like this person who is responsible for this webserver had security if you can change the website through anonymous ftp. Has it came to you that this person may be making a fool of you.. Comments GET OFF IRC and LEARN. :)
