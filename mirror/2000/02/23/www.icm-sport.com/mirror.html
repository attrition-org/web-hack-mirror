</big><small> The Conscience of a Hacker
  </small></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Arial"><small>   January 8, 1986
   =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
   </small></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Arial"><small>   Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. &quot;Teenager
   Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal&quot;, &quot;Hacker Arrested after Bank
   Tampering&quot;...
   Damn kids. They're all alike.
   </small></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Arial"><small>   But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain,
   ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder
   what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
   I am a hacker, enter my world...
   Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
   the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
   Damn underachiever. They're all alike.
   </small></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Arial"><small>   I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain
   for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. &quot;No,
   Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head...&quot;
   Damn kid. Probably copied it. They're all alike.
   </small></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Arial"><small>   I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is
   cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I
   screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me...
   Or feels threatened by me...
   Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
   Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
   Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike.
   </small></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Arial"><small>   And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through
   the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic
   pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is
   sought... a board is found.
   &quot;This is it... this is where I belong...&quot;
   I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to
   them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...
   Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike...
   You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at
   school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let
   slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by
   sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to
   teach found us will- ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water
   in the desert.
   </small></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Arial"><small>   This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
   beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without
   paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering
   gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us
   criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We
   exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious
   bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage
   wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's
   for our own good, yet we're the criminals.
   </small></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Arial"><small>   Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that
   of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
   My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never
   forgive me for.
   </small></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Arial"><small>   I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual,
   but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.
