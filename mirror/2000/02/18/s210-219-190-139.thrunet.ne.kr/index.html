To tha young R to tha E tha B to tha E tha L<br>
Never give up just live up<br>
Fed upon America<br>
We be spittin' it up<br>
Rippin' it up<br>
For an even amount in each cup<br>
To my brothers burning bare feet on black top<br>
Whose curled 'neath tha shadows<br>
From tha gaze of tha cops<br>
Whose huntin' for 9 to 5's through factory locks<br>
Is now hunted on this modern day auction block<br><br>
Flexin' and mashin'<br>
With complex text<br>
Fast and in a fashion<br>
That snap back necks<br>
Quicker than a fed cash tha company checks<br>
Come with tha fire only Marley could catch<br>
This be tha flame in tha cellar beware<br>
Nameless cold millions gaspin' for air<br>
Those naked and wageless<br>
Now scream within cages<br>
They make you pull your shit<br>
Just to get your share<br><br>
With this mic device<br>
I spit nonfiction<br>
Who got tha power<br>
This be my question<br>
Tha mass of tha few<br>
In this torn nation?<br>
Tha priest tha book or tha congregation?<br>
Tha politricks who rob and hold down your zone?<br>
Or those who give tha thieves tha key to their homes?<br>
Tha pig who's free to murder one<br>
Shucklak<br>
Or survivors who make a move and murder one back?<br><br>
<br><hr><br>
we are the freedom fighters, born as ghosts. strike out, against the government. we have our reasons, w00w00! <br>
bye now, but this is not the first, or last time you will see me...<br><br>i am a child of the darkstar</center></body>
