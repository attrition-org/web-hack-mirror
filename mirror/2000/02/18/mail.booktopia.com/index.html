Transmission third world war third round<br>
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground<br>
Ain't no shelter if you're looking for shade<br>
I lick shots at the brutal charade<br>
As tha polls close like a casket<br>
On truth devoured<br>
A silent play on the shadow of power<br>
A spectacle monopolized<br>
The camera's eye on choice disguised<br>
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?<br>
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?<br>
A spectacle monopolized<br>
They hold the reins and stole your eyes<br>
The fistagons bullets and bombs<br>
Who stuff the banks<br>
Who staff the party ranks<br>
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord<br>
None of the above fuck it cut the cord<br><br>
we are the freedom fighters, born as ghosts. strike out, against the government. we have our reasons,
w00w00! <br>
bye now, but this is not the first, or last time you will see me...<br><br>i am a child of the
