<fontface="TAHOMA">
Through steel walls<br>
Your voice blastin' on<br>
True rebel my brother Mumia<br>
I reflect upon<br>
You be tha spark<br>
That set all tha prairie fires on<br>
Make tha masses a mastodon path<br>
To trample tha fascists on<br>
At fifteen exposed Philly's finest killing machine<br>
With boots and mad guns<br>
They tried to pacify you young<br>
Cause and effect<br>
Smell tha smoke and tha breeze<br>
My panther my brother<br>
We are at war until you're free<br><br>
You'll never silence tha voice of tha voiceless<br><br>
You see tha powerful got nervous<br>
Cause he refused to be their servant<br>
'Cause he spit truth<br>
That shook heads<br>
And burned like black churches<br>
Prose and verses<br>
A million poor in hearses<br>
Watch tha decision of Dred Scott<br>
As it reserves<br>
So long as tha rope<br>
Is tight around Mumia's neck<br>
Let there be no rich white life<br>
We bound to respect<br>
Cause and effect<br>
Can't ya smell tha smoke in tha breeze<br>
My panther my brother we are at war until you're free<br><br>
You'll never silence tha voice of tha voiceless<br><br>
And Orwell's hell a terror era coming through<br>
But this little brother's watching you too<br>
<br><hr><br>
we are the freedom fighters, born as ghosts. strike out, against the government. we have our reasons, w00w00! <br>
bye now, but this is not the first, or last time you will see me...<br><br>i am a child of the darkstar</center></body>
