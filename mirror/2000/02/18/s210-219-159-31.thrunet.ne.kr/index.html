My fears hunt me down<br>
Capturing my memories<br>
The frontier of loss<br>
They try to escape across the street where<br>
Jesus stripped bare<br>
And raped the spirit he was supposed to nurture<br>
In the name of my in the name of my...<br><br>
Born of a broken man<br>
But not a broken man<br>
Born of a broken man<br>
Never a broken man<br><br>
Like autumn leaves<br>
His sense fell from him<br>
An empty glass of himself<br>
Shattered somewhere within<br>
His thoughts like a hundred moths<br>
Trapped in a lampshade<br>
Somewhere within<br>
Their wings banging and burning<br>
On through endless nights<br>
Forever awake he lies shaking and starving<br>
Praying for someone to turn off the light<br><br>
Born of a broken man<br>
But not a broken man<br>
Born of a broken man<br>
Never a broken man<br>
