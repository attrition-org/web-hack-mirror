The movie ran through me<br>
The glamour subdue me<br>
The tabloid untie me<br>
I'm empty please fill me<br>
Mister anchor assure me<br>
That Baghdad is burning<br>
Your voice it is so soothing<br>
That cunning mantra of killing<br>
I need you my witness<br>
To dress this up so bloodless<br>
To numb me and purge me now<br>
Of thoughts of blaming you<br>
Yes the car is our wheelchair<br>
My witness your coughing<br>
Oily silence mocks the legless<br>
Now traveling in coffins<br>
But on the corner<br>
The jury's sleepless<br>
We found your weakness<br>
And it's right outside our door<br><br>
Now testify<br><br>
With precision you feed me<br>
My witness I'm hungry<br>
Your temple it calms me<br>
So I can carry on<br>
My slaving sweating the skin right off my bones<br>
On a bed of fire I'm choking on the smoke that fills my home<br>
The wrecking ball rushing<br>
My witness your blushing<br>
The pipeline is gushing<br>
While here we lie in tombs<br>
While on the corner<br>
The jury's sleepless<br>
We found your weakness<br>
And it's right outside your door<br><br>
Now testify<br><br>
Mass graves for the pump and the price is set<br><br>
Who controls the past now controls the future<br>
Who controls the present now controls the past<br>
Who controls the past now controls the future<br>
Who controls the present now?<br><br>
Now testify<br>
<br><hr><br>
we are the freedom fighters, born as ghosts. strike out, against the government. we have our reasons, w00w00! <br>
bye now, but this is not the first, or last time you will see me...<br><br>i am a child of the darkstar</center></body>
