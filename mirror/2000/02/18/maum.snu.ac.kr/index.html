<fontface="TAHOMA">
The hills find peace<br>
Locked armed guard posts<br>
Safe from the screams<br>
Of the children born as ghosts<br>
Gates guns and alarms<br>
Shape the calm of the dawn<br>
Peering down into the basin<br>
Where death lives on<br>
Where young run foaming at the mouth with hate<br>
Where burning batons beat the freezing who shake<br>
Under the toxic sunsets they dine and toast<br>
Their walls deny the terror faced by the children<br>
Born as ghosts<br><br>
Born as ghosts<br><br>
One book and forty ghosts<br>
Stuffed in a room<br>
The school as a tomb<br>
Where home is a wasteland<br>
Taste the razor wire<br>
And thought is locked in the womb<br>
The tales that tear at the myth of the dream<br>
A suffering that shocks the lives off the screen<br><br>
Born as ghosts<br>
<br><hr><br>
we are the freedom fighters, born as ghosts. strike out, against the government. we have our reasons, w00w00! <br>
bye now, but this is not the first, or last time you will see me...<br><br>i am a child of the darkstar</center></body>
