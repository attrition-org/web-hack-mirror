        When you give us an instruction, we get full particulars from you after which we make enquiries and then present you with three quotations for  venues, accommodation, meals, refreshments and whatever other requirements you may have. Once you have made your choice, we take responsibility for all the arrangements. You and the venues are presented beforehand with all the details concerning the number of people, whether they sleep in single or double rooms, details and times of meals and refreshments, equipment  that is  needed, dates and times of arrivals and departures, etc.<br>
        <br>
        We are aware that you have a responsibility to save as much money as possible. We assist you in this since  we negotiate for the lowest prizes possible and we save you and your personnel the time and effort to do all these bookings and enquiries for yourself.
