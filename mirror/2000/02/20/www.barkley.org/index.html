<font size=1>Hello Administrator, looks like we got a problem here!  Check the logs and notice what I did.  Here is a run-down, I have renamed index.htm(l) and made it index.bak.  Delete the index.htm on this site, and rename index.bak index.htm(l).  Now once this is accomplished, note how I got into the 'system.'  I will not tell you how to prevent others, but you should know how, if not, your <u>FIRED</u>.  Once you figure this out, after a hard days work, thank me while you are alone.  Say thank you cuzz.  Why?  I just renamed a file, do you know what other people do now a days?  Stealing credit cards, deleting vital information that costs money.  And all I did was rename a file, and gave you a chance to cover up your mistake.  Good luck, and have a nice day - Cuzz

In the event of my Demise<br>when my heart can beat no more<br>
I Hope I Die For A Principle<br>
or A Belief that I had Lived for<br>
I will die Before My Time<br>
Because I feel the shadow's Depth<br>
so much I wanted to accomplish<br>
before I reached my Death<br>
I have come to grips with the possibility<br>
and wiped the last tear from My eyes<br>
I Loved All who were Positive<br>
In the event of my Demise</p>Tupac Amaru Shakur 1971-1996</p>

I love Jamie.</font></center></body></html>
