Wow, I rule! I managed to fix this exploit up a bit, and there I go and I own your box! Strange how when people find an exploit, they never think about using it deeper than what they already used it for :) I wont write long, maybe tomorow I'll rehack you and post a better message for people to atleast enjoy seeing this... And hey, I might change the 'Team Escape' picture as well, since this is already the 3rd site I use it on :)<br><br>
Anyways people I'll leave you at that, tomorow I'll try to write about the 'People who get offended' bitch, as I promised :)

Peace out!<br><br><font color="white" size=1>
