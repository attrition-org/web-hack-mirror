  <p align="left"><br>
  <font FACE="Times New Roman">Peter and Robyn Bannerman took over ownership of Steinberg
  Cellars in Alexandra during May 1998 and see this as an exciting time to be involved in
  the wine trade in Central Otago as new vineyards are producing excellent, award winning
  wines.</font></p>
  <font FACE="Times New Roman"><p>Peter is the proprietor at Steinberg and is usually about
  when you require assistance or a bit of light hearted banter<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">. </font></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Robyn works part-time</font><font FACE="Times New Roman"><font size="3">.</font></p>

  Go down the stairs at the centre and you are in the cellar.</small><font FACE="Times New Roman"></p>
  </font><p align="left"><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Many new events have taken
  place at Steinberg Cellars over the last few months.<br>
  &quot;Cellars Wine Club&quot; has been set up to give club members a greater level of
  flexibility with their wine buying. We want to avoid the situation where people feel
  obliged to take their wine when the supplier says so (as is often the case) and at the
  price that they stipulate. We aim to tailor our selections to meet members needs. they say
  when they want it, how much of it they want, the mix of wines to be included and of course
  the dollar value of the selection that is to be put together.<br>
  New members are most welcome. We're very contactable.<br>
