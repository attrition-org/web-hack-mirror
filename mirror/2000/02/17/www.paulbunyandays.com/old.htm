<p>The Old Fashioned Dress Review takes you back to a time when folks dressed, well,
different than we do now! That&#146;s not to say that if they could see us they
wouldn&#146;t have a good laugh, but the costumes worn by the men, women and children
parading in the dress review are typical of years past. From the very fancy dresses of the
1890 society ladies, to the lumberjack and cowboys work wear, they all bring back memories
from your favorite movie or T.V. show! Don&#146;t miss the colorful costumes of this years
dress review, put together by chairpersons <b>Carla Coverston and Sandy Savage</b>. It&#146;s a sight for sore eyes!</p>
