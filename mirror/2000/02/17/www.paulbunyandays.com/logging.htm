<p><b>Logging Show</b></p>

<p>The Paul Bunyan Days Logging Show takes place on Sunday during the Labor Day Weekend.
Competition begins at 12:00 noon. The Logging Show is the oldest continuously run logging
competition in California, beginning in 1939.</p>

<p>Events change from year to year, but generally include the Hand Chop, Choker Set, Axe
Throw, Single Hand Bucking, Jack and Jill, Double bucking, Horizontal Chop, Springboard
Chop, Stock Saw, Big Power Saw, and Hot Saw.</p>

<p>In between events is the Block Pack, a grueling contest of strength and endurance, put
on by the famous Kangaroo Kort. The crowd loves to watch as women carry two 75 pound
logging pulleys (called blocks) around two pylons for the greatest distance. The men carry
two 150 pound blocks, and you won&#146;t believe how far some of the contestants can go!</p>

<p>Cash Prizes are awarded to winners of each contest, and the entire show is presented to
the audience by a professional announcer. The show is put together by Gina Fales, and she
really knows how to make logging shows fun! This is one event you don&#146;t want to miss!</p>
