<p><b>Car Show</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each year the Paul Bunyan Days Car Show gets better and better. Put on
by Mike Mihos, the show runs most of the day Saturday, with every kind of custom vehicle
you can imagine. If you like beautifully painted custom cars, this is a must see. The show
always takes place within walking distance of downtown, and is a great addition to the
many activities happening during Labor Day Weekend.</p>
