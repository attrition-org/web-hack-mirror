<p><b>Fiddlers Contest</b></p>

<p>There&#146;s nothing better than sitting on a lawn in front of a beautiful Victorian
Home and listening to the great sounds of fiddle music! Come and join the crowd that
always gathers when the best fiddlers in the state show off their skills. The contest is
M-C&#146;d by Jonathan Lehan, a pretty good fiddler himself, and a fellow who will keep
you tapping your toes as you listen to the many talented musicians wring out their
violins, er, fiddles! The contest starts at 12:00 P.M. on Saturday, and is fun for the
whole family.</p>
