Well people, you were hacked. Sorry if you're an innocent half-life fan simply visiting this site, but I felt the deep, unhuman urge to hack this. And it was fun enough thank you! You can still view the original site by clicking on this <a href="index11.htm">link</a>. I wont bitch on this site, I bitched enough about gaming on the <a href="http://www.starcraft.co.za">www.starcraft.co.za</a> hack, so I won't bitch again. Honestly if I'm to bitch on all the sites I'll hack today, I'll never get it over with ;)

Your the second victim to get hacked today, but a lot more are coming. As it says in the picture, "Team eScape y2k Defacing Massacre", so by tonight a lot more sites will be defaced by us :)<br><br>
Peace out!<br>
