<p>Everything brings in, heavy mental day.. today.. you
experience something.. - never done.. <u>heavy mental</u>. ... </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Information begins gathering, forming the stargate and star
pattern towards saturn.. in between the eye sockets, is where i
build my sky rocket.. you don't need any passport, all you need
is a thought, suddenly - the thought launches.. voyaging 144
billion light years past the stars, long before there exist
quasars there existed a hebrew god, suddenly.. my brain blows as
hot as flame flows from the volcanoes.. as i slowly, hold my
hands and STRETCH..- up from the sky.. why? because we almost
there.. trying to adapt to the air pressure.. now we searching
for the mental treasure (pleasure)..</p>

<p align="center">(weird huh? it's all i remember of some
reallyyyy cool track.. errr something.)</p>
