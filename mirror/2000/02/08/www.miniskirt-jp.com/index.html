altering drugs!</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">w00p, you people have no
idea how insecure this place is, fucking move on...find yourself
a new webhosting place. Granted MANY are very insecure, I have
found some running proftpd pre3! haha......well I found it
amusing....</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">So you people are wondering
why I do this (if you didn't see the last one)...I doit because
security is a major issue on the internet and these companys
don't take it seriously. They assume that because nobody has
hacked them yet they will never get hacked. HAHA Well I know
people who scan for exploitable systems all freaking day, none
stop. I think you guys are lucky I gained access to your system
before some malious hax3r. Atleast I save your old index.html :)</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">So like, learn about
security and cry to your admins about updating their fucking
systems, wouldn't you rather the box be down for one day and be
secure then it never go down and be about as secure as a 17 year
old teen with more pimples then words in the dictionary?</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">THATS WHAT I THOUGHT. FLOOD
THE ADMINS WITH EMAILS REQUESTING....NOOO REQUIRING THAT THEY
SECURE THEIR SYSTEMS OR LOSE YOUR BUSINESS...ITS FUCKING SAD. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">Yeah, I have let out my
anger...time for you to do the same.</font></p>
