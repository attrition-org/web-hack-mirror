<p>This is just some of the recent national coverage MEGABAIT
received</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><strong>The Glasgow Herald reported</strong>&quot;Scotlands
rivers are being emptied of fish stocks following a change in the
law which allows anglers to use a bait that has been outlawed for
more than a century. <br>
Conservationists now are calling for the loophole to be closed
and for the reintroduction of ban on bait made from fish eggs <br>
The 1868 Salmon fisheries act was amended in April95 to allow
fish farmers to sell salmon roe to japan and capture a share of a
12million pound market for the product.<br>
However one farmer has cashed in on the change in the law to
commercially produce a bait made from rainbow trout eggs which
fish find irresistable . More than £20,000 worth of Megabait has
been sold since April with anglers willing to pay up to £10 per
jar <br>
. The Trout and Salmon Association in Scotland has called for the
change in the law to be reversed before the bait leads to the
destruction of fish stocks in scottish rivers.<br>
Mr Michael Smith the associations chairman, said:&quot;this is
our worst nightmare come true .This man pruducing his bait
threatens fish stocks in rivers across Scotland and endangers the
whole industry.<br>
&quot;this bait is unfair .The fish find it irresistible and it
makes it too easy for anglers to catch them. The law should be
reverted back before thes bait leads to the total destruction of
fish stocks.Our fishing methods are becoming too clever by
half.&quot;<br>
Bait made from fish roe is known among anglers as
&quot;putty&quot; and is popular with poachers, who use it to
lure fish into their nets. Prosecutions for possession of the
bait were common before this years amendment to the law <br>
Trout are particularly atracted to the bait ,especially during
the autumn months when they follow salmon upriver to feast on
salmon eggs during spawning.<br>
Mr Smith hopes the change in the law will come before this years
spawning season. He added:&quot;Trout follow salmon upriver for
the extra produced during spawning .Great numbers of them follow
salmon upstream for the anual feast.<br>
&quot;On rivers like the Tay using this bait when the salmon are
spawning could seriously deplete trout stocks. The law should be
amended to stop this from happening.&quot;<br>
Some rivers including the Tay and the Spey , are subject to
by-laws which forbid the use of Megabait and no major angling
clubs accept its use by their members.<br>
However, Mr David Buchanan , of Newmill Trout Farm denies that
his product is causing a decline in fish stocks.<br>
He said : &quot;I sell Megabait because anglers want it .I have
been overwhelmed by the demand for it .It has always been a very
successful bait and I cant produce enough.<br>
