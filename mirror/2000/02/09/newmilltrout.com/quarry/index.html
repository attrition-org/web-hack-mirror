<h1>MOUSE WATER QUARRY</h1>

<p><img src="quarry1.jpg" width="481" height="231"></p>

<p>Mouse Waters production derives from fluvial glacial sediments
laid down in eskers~in sufficient volume ~and of the quality
required to match the needs of the building industry~a sector
subject to the vagaries of the economy . </p>

<p>Despite these fluctuations ,AMP is flexible enough to meet the
demand for high qualify washed concrete sand.10 mm.20 mend 40mm
grade gravel's conforms BSS 882 and washed building sand to BSS
1200.Drying shrinkage conforms to the requirements of category A
with compliance assured through daily on site laboratory testing</p>

<h2>Extraction and the Environment</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Protecting the energy of the surrounding area and its
residents demands a thorough understanding of the engineering
complexities of quarrying.Inbuilt noise reduction systems mean
negligible intrusion on neighboring property and minimal
disruption to an established rural way of life.That life style is
enhanced by the nearby golf course reclaimed from a former quarry
and by the presence of a listed monument~a roman camp.</p>

<p>All this without impacting on the finished quality of the
aggregates produced!</p>

<h2>On Site and Surrounding Safety</h2>

<p>To ensure strict compliance with all required regulations ,and
to set local minds to rest,a monthly external audit is carried
out by an independent safety consultancy .On health and safety
issues ,AMP practice a policy of rigid ,self imposed procedures
to protect staff and eliminate avoidable risk at all stages of
the extraction process.</p>

<p>By definition these safety measures apply equally to those
living and working within the immediate vicinity o Mouse Water.</p>
