<!-- BEGIN MAIN BODY SECTION -->  <h3>NASULG/CAAU/ACE Letter to OMB Regarding FOIA Issues Involved in Circular A-110
  Revision Mandated in HR 4328, the FY '99 Omnibus Appropriations Bill</h3>
  <p>April 5, 1999 </p>
  <p>F. James Charney<br>

  Washington, D.C. 20503 </p>
  <p><b><i>Re: Proposed Revision of OMB Circular A-110</i></b> </p>
  <p>Dear Mr. Charney: </p>
  <p>This letter is filed on behalf of the Association of American Universities, the
  National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, and the American
  Council on Education concerning the proposed revision to OMB Circular A-110 that was
  published in the Federal Register on February 4, 1999. These organizations and other
  representatives of the higher education and research communities have expressed serious
  concerns over the potential negative impact of the proposed rule on the scientific
  research community. This letter deals specifically with legal concerns related to the
  Freedom of Information Act. </p>
  <p><b>Interpretation of Language Referencing the Freedom of Information Act</b> </p>
  <p>Both the legislation and OMB's proposed implementing rule state that requesters may
  have access to grant data &quot;through the procedures established under the Freedom of
  Information Act.&quot; The imprecise wording of the legislation, and of OMB's proposed
  rule, in their reference to &quot;procedures established under the Freedom of Information
  Act&quot; has raised concerns regarding application of the FOIA exemptions. Will all
  existing exemptions identified in the law and accompanying court case decisions continue
  to stand without exception in agencies' interpretation of the statute? Could those seeking
  a looser interpretation of FOIA exemptions establish a legal case based on the fact that
  the law refers to &quot;procedures established under FOIA&quot; rather than directly to
  the law itself? </p>
  <p><b>Privacy Concerns</b> </p>
  <p>Does interpretation of FOIA exemption (b)(6), concerning &quot;clearly unwarranted
  invasion of personal privacy,&quot;<b><sup>1</sup></b> offer sufficient protection to
  honor assurances that have been given and will necessarily continue to be given to private
  persons, concerning the confidentiality and anonymity that are needed for certain types of
  studies? Can grantees be assured that agencies will strictly interpret this exemption to
  remove all personal identifiers from research data?<br>
  Commercial Value </p>
  <p>Exemption (b)(4), for &quot;trade secrets and commercial or financial . . . [and]
  confidential&quot; information,<b><sup>2</sup></b> is also of particular importance to
  grant recipients. Much research data that are produced under federal grants, but possessed
  only by the recipient, are maintained as highly confidential for competitive reasons. The
  mere possibility of releasing this valuable, confidential data to third parties, for other
  than a federal purpose, is contrary to present grant terms and present FOIA law.
  Presently, recipients own the data in that they may obtain all copyrights and patents that
  arise from it. [OMB Circular A-110 ¼ __.36(a) and (b)]. Awarding agencies are granted
  only a license in such rights. [Id.] Awarding agencies also have a right to obtain copies
  of any data produced. [Id. at ¼ __.36(c)(1)]. They may choose to share the data with
  third parties, however, only for a federal purpose. [Id. at ¼ __.36(c)(2)]. Does the
  legislation leave these rules in place or does it override the Circular A 110 limit to
  data retrieval only for a federal purpose? Or does it effectively broaden the definition
  of federal purpose to include any public request? </p>
  <p>OMB Circular A-110 allows federal agencies to obtain grant data - a predicate to any
  public access under FOIA procedures - for <i>disclosure</i> only if done for a federal
  purpose: no federal purpose, no disclosure. And yet disclosure of these data under FOIA
  threatens to import the basic principles of FOIA that provide that agency records must be
  disclosed, unless specifically exempted, without regard to the motive or even the identity
  of the requester or the impact on the agency. Because of these basic principles, courts
  have interpreted FOIA exemptions narrowly and resolved any doubt against the government.
  (Under FOIA, the agency has the burden of proof in court.) </p>
  <p>Third-party requesters under FOIA, at present, have <i>no</i> right of access to data
  that the agency chooses to leave in a recipient's possession. [<i>Forsham v. Harris</i>,
  445 U.S. 169, 171-72 (1980)]. The recipient thus is the sole owner of such data, unless
  and until the agency exercises its right to obtain a copy. Due to the great volume of data
  produced, the great majority of data is owned, in practice, only by the recipient. </p>
  <p>It presently is unclear to what extent these data generated by non profit institutions
  may be exempted from release under FOIA. In <i>Washington Research Project v. HEW</i>, the
  U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that there was no protection, under FOIA
  exemption (b)(4), against release of a scientific research <i>proposal</i> for federal
  grant funding. [504 F.2d 238 (C.A. D.C. 1974)]: </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It . . . defies common sense to pretend that the scientist is engaged in trade or
    commerce. This is not to say that the scientist may not have a preference for or an
    interest in nondisclosure of his research design . . . . We cannot, consistent with
    [FOIA]'s recognized mandate to construe exemptions narrowly, extend them by analogies that
    lead so far away from the plain meaning of exemption 4. Consequently, we hold that
    research designs submitted in grant applications are not exempt from disclosure under
    [FOIA].</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>[Id. at 244]. </p>
  <p>In other contexts, however, the law appears to recognize the inherently
  &quot;trade&quot; and &quot;commercial&quot; nature of research data created by
  universities, hospitals, and non profits with federal funding. [Cf. <i>Vest v. Waring</i>,
  565 F. Supp. 674, 686-89 (N.D. Ga. 1983)]. (such research efforts are not automatically
  immune from suit under the Sherman Act prohibition of actions in restraint of trade or
  commerce.) A compilation of information can be a &quot;trade secret.&quot; [<i>Restatement
  of Torts</i> ¼ 757 (1939)]. Both patent and copyright laws apply to such research, and
  are referenced in ¼ __.36 of OMB Circular A-110. Moreover, even where nonprofit
  institutions and researchers are involved, it is manifest that there is substantial
  competition both within and among grantee institutions - competition for grant funds,
  competition for public recognition, competition for nongrant resources, and, ultimately,
  competition in the commercial marketplace for products that might be developed from the
  work done by grantees. </p>
  <p>The question whether grant recipients will be able to rely on exemption (b)(4) of FOIA
  in the face of this new right of third-party access to data under the procedures of FOIA
  can only be resolved with certainty in federal courts, and not by OMB. As a result, all
  recipients will be required to operate for a period of some years without knowing the
  extent of their protection, under FOIA, regarding data they consider to be valuable and
  sensitive for commercial, or noncommercial but competitive, reasons. </p>
  <p>The uncertain application of FOIA exemption (b)(4) leaves recipients utterly in the
  dark about whether data that they treat confidentially and consider commercially valuable
  will continue to be protected from release to third parties. This uncertainty is likely to
  be a very negative consideration for all potential recipients in deciding whether to seek
  federal funding for research projects. This can only impair future research and adversely
  affect the public interest. </p>
  <p><b>Prospective Application of Legislation</b> </p>
  <p>The uncertain application of FOIA exemption (b)(4) makes critical an important aspect
  of the new right of access required by the legislation: Is it the intent of OMB that the
  circular change will apply only to data produced under awards made after OMB's final rule
  is published and takes effect? Such clarification would be important to protect existing
  data against improper and mistaken releases by agencies in response to requests made under
  FOIA. Legal precedent supports this view. Over a decade ago, the United States Supreme
  Court set out the principles governing whether implementing regulations issued by a
  federal agency may be retroactive in their effect. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[A] statutory grant of legislative rule making power [to a federal agency] will not, as
    a general matter, be understood to encompass the power to promulgate retroactive rules
    unless that power is conveyed by Congress in express terms.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>[<i>Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital</i>, 488 U.S. 204, 208 (1988)].<b><sup>3</sup></b>
  </p>
  <p><b>Administrative Burden</b> </p>
  <p>The legislation may well, in practice, do violence to the very law that it proposes to
  apply. It may bury agencies in an avalanche of new requests, requiring them to obtain <i>and
  review</i> mountains of data (<i>e.g.</i>, slogging through volumes of linear clinical
  research due to the privacy exemption in ¼ 552(b)(6)) with the same care applied to
  other, traditional agency records that the agency can limit by choice. This could grind
  agency FOIA offices to a halt and stem the flow of other important information to the
  public and press. </p>
  <p>Moreover, it is likely to be simply impossible to apply FOIA's time limits to requests
  for voluminous grant data. The very law that is being invoked to provide a door to grant
  data stands in danger of erosion, if not evisceration, by the burdens that may be imposed
  by the legislation. </p>
  <p><b>Narrow versus Broader Interpretation of FOIA </p>
  <p></b>Likewise, applying FOIA's exemptions under a traditionally narrow interpretation of
  their scope - especially relating to claims of personal privacy and commercial
  confidentiality - is more likely to harm than advance both the interests of grantees and
  the granting agency. FOIA's exemption (b)(6), for example, does not protect against <i>any</i>
  invasion of personal privacy, only one that is &quot;clearly unwarranted.&quot; But no
  invasion of privacy of individuals participating in clinical trials or studies funded by
  federal grants can be consistent with a &quot;federal purpose,&quot; even if such invasion
  cannot be shown to be &quot;clearly unwarranted.&quot; Thus agencies must, as a practical
  matter, imbue meaning into the &quot;federal purpose&quot; requirement of the Circular by
  raising the bar for disclosure where private interests - personal privacy and commercial
  confidentiality - are adversely affected. The meaning of &quot;federal purpose&quot; must
  include the purpose for which the grant was made and the program objectives of the
  granting agency; these goals militate toward a broad, rather than a narrow, interpretation
  of the FOIA exemptions when applied to grant data through the revised Circular. </p>
  <p>We appreciate your consideration of these comments. </p>
