      <p>The Commerce Department recently announced its plans to award approximately $17 million
      in grants to state, local and non-profit entities to extend the benefits of the Internet
      and other information technology services to all Americans, especially those in
      underserved communities. Applications are due by March 11, 1999.</p>
      <p>Since 1994, the Commerce Department&#146;s Telecommunications and Information
      Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP) has provided more than $118 million in matching
      grants to organizations that develop innovative, practical projects that use advanced
      telecommunications and information technology. Administered by the National
      Telecommunications and Infrastructure Administration (NTIA), the TIIAP has funded projects
      focusing on innovations in education and training, support for the creation of more
      responsive public institutions, enhancement of economic development in rural and
      disadvantaged areas, and increased public access to health care. For example, in 1997,
      Pennsylvania State University received a grant in order to develop a video
      teleconferencing system that allowed remotely located nurses to provide home health
      services to diabetics in Philadelphia County. The University of Illinois, Urbana received
      funds to increase the level of Internet access to low income communities in their area.
      The University of Tennessee Medical Center at Knoxville received a grant to develop a
      tele-medicine system that provides care for trauma patients by enabling image and voice
      communication among ambulances, rural emergency departments, and a Level I Trauma Center.
      And the University of Utah at Salt Lake City received $369,951 to implement a video
      network for communities in rural Utah that provides services, such as physical and
      occupational therapy, to children with special needs.</p>
      <p>According to NTIA, grant applicants are encouraged to consider the use of advanced
      network technologies to enhance the quality and efficiency of services delivered through
      non-profit networks. Also, they are encouraged to demonstrate an involvement in
      cross-cutting projects utilizing partnerships among five application areas-community
      networking, education, culture, and lifelong learning, health, public safety and public
      services.</p>
      <p>NTIA will hold a series of regional, technical assistance workshops to discuss the
      TIIAP funding priorities, application requirements, and lessons learned from previous
      TIIAP grantees. The workshops will be held on January 26 in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
      January 29 in Memphis, Tennessee, February 3 in Boston, Massachusetts; and February 11, in
      Chicago, Illinois.</p>
