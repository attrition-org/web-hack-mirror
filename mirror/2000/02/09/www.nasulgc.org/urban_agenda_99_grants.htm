      1999</p>
      <p>DATE: JANUARY 20, 1999</p>
      <p>INFORMATION: The U.S. Department of Education has developed a series of program
      guidelines and time frames for grant applications for new programs authorized by the HEA,
      and existing programs that received significant increases in funding. Similarly, the
      Department of Commerce has released its grant applications for the FY 99 National
      Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP). Several of
      the DoED programs and the TIIAP may be of interest to urban institutions of higher
      education. This information is also being provided by AASCU&#146;s Office of Federal
      Programs. The initiatives are as follows:</p>

      a high poverty middle school, and at least two other partners such as a nonprofit

      based on entrance exams; work with a whole grade level of students to raise expectations;
      and start with 6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> grade students and continue through
      graduation with a comprehensive range of services. Collaborations between state and
      partnership grant applicants are welcomed. The department will also be conducting
      application workshops around the country starting in March. Applications will be available
