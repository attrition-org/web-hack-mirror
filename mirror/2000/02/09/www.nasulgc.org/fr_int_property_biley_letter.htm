<p>May 26, 1999</p>

<p>The Honorable Tom Bliley<br>
Chairman<br>
Committee on the Commerce<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
2409 Rayburn House Office Building<br>
Washington, DC 20515</p>

<p>Dear Chairman Bliley:</p>

<p>I write on behalf of the Association of American Universities, the American Council on
Education, and the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges to
commend you for the introduction of H.R. 1858, The Consumer and Investor Access to
Information Act of 1999. Data and information are the foundation of scientific and
scholarly research and teaching. Preserving the ability of universities, their faculties
and students to produce, analyze, integrate, and disseminate data is essential to
sustaining the productivity of this nation&#146;s integrated system of academic research
and education. This research and education system has played a key role in U.S. leadership
in science and technology and U.S. higher education is one of our most robust industries,
drawing millions of students worldwide. </p>

<p>At the same time, universities, their faculties and students will benefit from policies
that preserve the economic incentive to produce valuable new collections of information.
As both producers and users of databases, universities have a vested interest in policies
that will protect the proprietary and information integrity of databases while assuring
that research and educational programs can effectively access and use databases and their
elements for the creation and dissemination of new knowledge. This legislation
accomplishes these objectives by responding to the needs of database producers and
consumers with effectively balanced provisions. </p>

<p>We look forward to working with you as this promising legislative initiative moves
forward. </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
