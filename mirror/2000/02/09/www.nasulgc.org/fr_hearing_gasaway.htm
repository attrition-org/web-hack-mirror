      Law Library and Professor of Law,<br>
      University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill<br>
      Concerning Promotion of Distance Education Through Digital Technologies<br>
      January 27, 1999, Washington, DC</strong></p>
      <p>I am Laura N. Gasaway, Director of the Law Library and Professor of Law at the
      University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am grateful to have this opportunity to
      present testimony on distance education on behalf of the Association of American
      Universities, the American Council on Education, and the National Association of State
      Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, as well as the organizations listed at the end of
      this testimony.</p>
      <p>Education is the principal societal function for developing our nation&#146;s human
      resources. As we move into an information age where both cooperation and competition will
      be played out on a global stage, the ability of the United States to meet its domestic and
      international challenges and responsibilities will depend critically on its educational
      capacity.</p>
      <p>For decades, distance education has expanded the reach of educational programs in time
      and space, thereby expanding the nation&#146;s capacity to educate its citizens. New
      developments in information technology and digital networks provide the opportunity to
      expand and enrich distance education. Whether it is professionals working long hours or
      parents meeting family commitments at home, the flexible nature of technology now allows
      people to access educational programs when their own schedules permit.</p>
      <p>Our institutions are using technologies in innovative ways to provide instruction via
      satellite, one and two-way video, and over the Internet. Some are combining several forms
      of advanced telecommunications and technologies. For instance, students can watch live
      lectures over cable television, submit class assignments by email and participate in
      discussion groups with students around the world. Moreover, new applications permit the
      enrichment of educational content through creative multimedia combinations. Soon, it will
      become commonplace to conduct fully interactive classes over the Internet.</p>
      <p>However, changes in copyright law will be necessary to fully exploit these new
      capacities.</p>
      <p>The basic objective of distance education legislation should be to enable remotely all
      instructional activities that are currently permitted in the classroom, provided that
      adequate safeguards exist against the misuse of copyrighted material that would harm the
      market for that material.</p>
      <p>The following changes in copyright law should be made to achieve this objective:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1. Section 110(2) should be changed to enable the display and performance of
          copyrighted works at remote locations at times selected by students. Where such display or
          performance is distributed over digital networks, such a capacity for performance and
          display will necessarily require an exemption from Section 106 rights of distribution and
          copying, since the material must be &quot;distributed&quot; over networks to a computer
          terminal or other device and since ephemeral copies are necessarily made in the course of
          transmission.</p>
          <p>The current 110(2) exemptions are based on technologies extant more than two decades
          ago. These exemptions need to be updated to accommodate the expanded educational
          opportunities supported by new technologies. Appropriate legislation should focus on the
          educational goal and reason back from that objective to accommodate the intervening steps
          necessary to realize the goal. For distance education, the goal is to deliver remotely
          through display or performance of copyrighted material the same educational content that
          can be delivered through display or performance in the traditional classroom. Since
          material delivered over computer networks will technically involve
          &quot;distributions&quot; and &quot;reproductions&quot; that fall under Section 106
          proprietary rights, the 110(2) distance education exemption must be expanded to exempt
          such distributions and reproductions that are necessary but incidental means to achieve
          the educational objective.</p>
          <p>2. The distinction in current law between types of works that qualify for a distance
          education performance exemption should be eliminated. The distinction between dramatic and
          non-dramatic works has never made educational sense and is now untenable in the context of
          new multimedia capabilities.</p>
          <p>Now that technology allows almost any type of work to be combined with other types of
          work in a multimedia presentation, a law that allows a still image to be displayed
          distantly, but does not allow that same image in motion media to be performed distantly
          undermines the educational possibilities of distance education. But the current 110(2)
          exemption limits the performance right to non-dramatic literary or musical works, placing
          significant handicaps on distance education programs. Scholarship does not draw such
          distinctions between the many and varied forms of art, music, literature, and other forms
          of information and entertainment. One cannot study modern culture or ancient civilizations
          without studying all their manifestations, but the current exemption draws educationally
          irrational distinctions that limit the quality of a distance education course for the
          student. Moreover, it adds to the cost of producing the programs, because courses prepared
          for and presented in the classroom must be specially edited in order to qualify for
          distance education.</p>
          <p>Performances allowed in a traditional classroom should also be allowed in distance
          education, and the law should be changed accordingly.</p>
          <p>3. These extensions of the 110(2) display and performance exemptions should be
          available under circumstances where the educational institution can provide reasonable
          protection against downstream reproduction and redistribution.</p>
          <p>Copyright owners have a valid concern about unauthorized copying and distribution.
          Colleges and universities, which are owners as well as users of copyrighted materials,
          share this concern. To protect against unauthorized copying and distribution, the
          extension of the distance education exemption to include all material that can be
          displayed or performed in a traditional classroom should be limited to circumstances where
          reproduction and redistribution can reasonably be prevented.</p>
          <p>Under these circumstances, there is no reason to treat performance or display in
          distance education differently from performance or display in a classroom. The educational
          benefits to society are considerable, and the risk of market harm is minimal. This
          approach also eliminates the shifting distinctions between different and rapidly evolving
          kinds of technology and between categories such as synchronous and asynchronous
          transmission, local and remote delivery of educational content, and classroom and
          non-classroom settings that currently cloud the debate about copyright and distance
          education.</p>
          <p>With this approach, the exemption would apply when the copyrighted material is
          transmitted to students at a remote location through video-teleconferencing. The exemption
          would also apply when the material is transmitted to a student over the Internet to a home
          computer terminal, if the technology used reasonably prevents downloading or
          redistribution of the work.</p>
          <p>A reasonably secure mode of delivery does not provide absolute assurance that the
          displayed or performed material cannot be reproduced or redistributed; indeed, it is
          technically possible to reproduce a classroom performance. Reasonable protection would
          mean that material is not easily reproducible or redistributable. Under these
          circumstances, digital works made available for distance education would be at no greater
          risk than digital works made available directly by publishers to consumers. In practice,
          material distributed by higher education institutions in the context of institutional
          policies governing the appropriate use of copyrighted material may foster greater
          compliance with appropriate use policies than would otherwise be the case.</p>
          <p>Legislation should specify the policy outcome-display and performance of all material
          in distance education circumstances where reproduction and redistribution can reasonably
          be prevented-without attempting to specify technology-specific means to achieve that end.</p>
          <p>4. In circumstances where access to information is controlled-e.g., limited to
          registered students through passwords or other technological controls-but the mode of
          delivery cannot provide reasonable protections against reproduction or redistribution,
          some form of exemption should be provided but might require a stronger assurance against
          market harm-for example, by limiting the conditions of performance.</p>
          <p>Thus, an institution should be permitted to perform any work in a distance education
          environment if reproduction and redistribution can reasonably be prevented. However, in a
          less secure environment where reproduction or redistribution, though unlikely, cannot
          reasonably be prevented, the institution might only be permitted to distribute a
          performance that would not have a significant market impact if inappropriately reproduced
          or redistributed. Such performances might include student performances or other
          non-commercial performances of a current dramatic work.</p>
          <p>Although we cannot specify at this time exactly how such distinctions would be drawn,
          the general principle should be that the extent of a distance education exemption should
          vary directly with degree of control over material that can reasonably be assured.
          Moreover, in both secured and controlled environments, distance education programs should
          be accompanied by institutional policies governing appropriate use of copyrighted
          materials and educational efforts to inform students and faculty about the rights of
          copyright owners, the limitations to those rights, and the circumstances under which they
          apply.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Fair Use</p>
      <p>A specific exemption for distance education must not be construed to replace or preempt
      a fair use defense to an infringement claim. Fair use provisions apply to all of the
      rights of the copyright owner, including the right to display and perform publicly. But
      beyond display and performance, a fair use defense would apply to all uses of information
      in distance education as it would in any other circumstances. For example, a student
      should be able to reproduce a portion of material made available in distance education if
      the use to which that reproduction were put met the four-factor test of Section 107.
      Similarly, if copying material onto a server for students to access is not exempted under
      Section 110(2), an instructor might still be able to do so on the basis of fair use.</p>
      <p>Licensing</p>
      <p>The availability of licensing does not obviate the need for a distance education
      exemption. The purpose of such an exemption is to promote the public benefits provided by
      distance education. While licensing is now and will continue to be an important means of
      defining the terms for use of copyrighted works, licensing cannot substitute for the need
      for a distance education exemption for display and performance of works, both for economic
      reasons and reasons of principle.</p>
      <p>Requiring licensing of lawfully acquired material that institutions may only want to
      display or perform could prove to be an economic burden on some institutions, and a
      transactional burden on all. More fundamentally, the power to license is the power to
      determine the terms of use and ultimately, the power to deny access to information, too
      great a shroud to place over distance education. We do not mean to suggest any a priori
      obligation on the part of a copyright owner to make material available, but to argue that
      a reliance on licensing to the exclusion of a distance education exemption could unbalance
      the relationship between copyright owners and educators.</p>
      <p>For distance education to be able to flourish under the new educational dimensions
      enabled by technological advances, colleges and universities need a set of statutory
      provisions that define appropriate uses of lawfully acquired material. Within statutory
      boundaries, faculty and students are then free to use such material to advance educational
      interests without having to try to manage conflicting license provisions, uncertain costs,
      differing expirations and complicated renegotiations.</p>
      <p>Licensing should remain a voluntary overlay on distance education policy that includes
      a prudently expanded 110(2) exemption and the appropriate application of fair use. The
      continuation of limitations to and exemptions from the proprietary rights of copyright
      owners will also play an important role in defining the appropriate terms of licenses that
      are negotiated.</p>
      <p>Conclusion</p>
      <p>The Constitution authorizes copyright for the purpose of &quot;promot[ing] the progress
      of science and the useful arts.&quot; The framers recognized that a limited monopoly on
      one&#146;s creative work provides a social benefit by providing an incentive for
      creativity and invention. Copyright does not establish an exclusive right to the ideas or
      information embodied in a work, however. For science and the useful arts to progress, it
      is necessary that members of society have access the information and be able freely to
      grapple with the ideas produced by creative work.</p>
      <p>The current education exemptions from the proprietary rights specified in copyright law
      recognize that educational uses of copyrighted material are a special category of use. The
      purpose of our nation&#146;s educational system is uniquely congruent with the fundamental
      purpose of copyright. That is, educational institutions directly promote the progress of
      science and the useful arts, to the benefit of society as a whole. Distance education
      technologies magnify the capacity of educational institutions to serve this public
      interest.</p>
      <p>The changes in law that we have suggested here will achieve the educational goal stated
      earlier of permitting remotely all instructional activities that are currently permitted
      in the classroom, provided that adequate safeguards exist against the misuse of
      copyrighted material. This updated exemption for distance educational uses of copyrighted
      materials supports the purpose of copyright articulated in the Constitution, and is the
      appropriate policy to further the public interest.</p>
