    <blockquote>
      <p>With welfare caseloads down by nearly half since 1993 and over 10,000 companies
      committed to welfare-to-work, President Clinton will announce today a new package of
      initiatives designed to ensure that those remaining on the welfare rolls make a successful
      transition from welfare to work. These initiatives have a new focus&#151;to increase the
      employment of low-income fathers so they can support their children.</p>
      <p>The President&#146;s $1 billion Welfare-to-Work initiative would help 200,000 more
      people work. At least $150 million is dedicated to helping fathers fulfill their
      responsibilities to their children by working and paying child support. Remaining funds
      focus on long-term welfare recipients with the greatest obstacles to employment. The
      President also will announce that his budget will contain new welfare-to-work housing
      vouchers, transportation funds, and tax credits to help those on welfare get to work and
      stay employed. These initiatives would provide parents the tools they need to support
      their children and succeed in the workforce.</p>
      <p>Welfare-to-Work Funds with a Focus on Fathers The President&#146;s $1 billion
      Welfare-to-Work initiative would help 200,000 long-term welfare recipients in high-poverty
      areas move into lasting unsubsidized employment. It is an extension of the two-year, $3
      billion Welfare-to-Work program the President secured in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. The
      initiative, as reauthorized, provides at least $150 million to ensure that every state
      helps fathers fulfill their responsibilities by working, paying child support, and playing
      a responsible part in their children&#146;s lives. </p>
      <p>Under this proposal, states and communities would use a minimum of 20 percent of their
      formula funds to provide job placement and job retention assistance to low-income fathers
      who sign personal responsibility contracts committing them to work and pay child support.
      This effort would further increase child support collections, which have risen 80 percent
      since the President took office, from $8 billion in 1992 to $14.4 billion in 1998.
      Remaining funds go toward assisting long-term welfare recipients with the greatest
      barriers to employment to move into lasting jobs. The reauthorized program also doubles
      the welfare-to-work funding available for tribes.</p>
      <p>Also, the Department of Labor will announce today the availability of $240 million in
      competitive grants from the current $3 billion Welfare-to-Work program. These funds will
      support innovative local welfare-to-work strategies for individuals with limited English
      proficiency, disabilities, substance abuse problems, or a history of domestic violence.</p>
      <p>Transportation and Housing for Families Moving From Welfare to Work The President also
      will announce today that his budget will contain $580 million for welfare to work housing
      vouchers and transportation assistance to help those on welfare obtain work and stay
      employed. The President&#146;s budget will provide $430 million for 75,000 welfare-to-work
      housing vouchers, including $144 million in new funds for 25,000 additional vouchers. This
      is a 50-percent increase over the 50,000 vouchers the President secured last year. The
      vouchers would help families move closer to a new job, reduce a long commute, or secure
      more stable housing so they can perform better on the job. The President&#146;s budget
      also increases Access to Jobs transportation funding from $75 million to $150 million,
      doubling the number of individuals and communities that can receive transportation
      assistance. This competitive grant program supports innovative state and local
      transportation solutions such as shuttles, van pools, new bus routes, and connector
      services to mass transit to help welfare recipients and other low-income workers get to
      work.</p>
      <p>Private Sector Hiring from the Welfare Rolls The President will announce that his
      budget will include $530 million to extend for one year Welfare to Work and Work
      Opportunity Tax Credits to encourage more employers to hire welfare recipients and other
      disadvantaged individuals. Already, in response to the President&#146;s challenge two
      years ago in his State of the Union Address, 10,000 companies have joined the Welfare to
      Work Partnership and hired, retained, and promoted hundreds of thousands of former welfare
      recipients. Forty-two percent of these companies are very small businesses (25 or fewer
      employees), while four percent are very large businesses (3,000 or more employees).
      Welfare Rolls Decline as More Recipients Go to Work The President will release
      state-by-state data showing that welfare caseloads are at their lowest level in 30 years
      and that the welfare rolls have fallen by nearly half since he took office. Since January
      1993, 36 states have had caseload declines of more than 40 percent and nationwide the
      rolls have fallen by 44 percent, from 14.1 million to just below 8 million.</p>
      <p>Information released recently by the Department of Health and Human Services also shows
      that the percentage of welfare recipients working has tripled since 1992, that an
      estimated 1.5 million people who were on welfare in 1997 were working in 1998, and that
      all states met the first overall work participation rates required under the welfare
      reform law.</p>
