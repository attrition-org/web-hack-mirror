        On Tuesday, October 27, the Coalition of America's Colleges and Universities launched a
        national campaign to educate the public about the true costs of obtaining a college
        education and opportunities for financing that education.&nbsp; </b></font><font FACE="Times Roman"><p ALIGN="left"><b>Nearly 1,200 colleges and universities will
        participate along with several higher education associations.&nbsp; The coalition has
        published a comprehensive resource guide and is providing up-to-the-minute information at
        the <a href="http://www.CollegeIsPossible.org">College is Possible web site</a> or through
        the Department of Education's special toll-free number for college education
        (1-800-433-3243)</b></p>
        <p ALIGN="left"><b>The campaign is in response to survey research showing that many
        parents and students vastly overestimate the price of attending college, while
        underestimating the financial aid resources available to them.&nbsp; The danger is that
        these individuals will believe college is a financially unattainable goal and will miss
        out on the opportunity for a college education.</b></p>
        <p ALIGN="left"><b>Speakers at the campaign launch included Richard W. Riley, Secretary of
        the U.S. Department of Education, America Council on Education (ACE) President Stanley
        Ikenberry and NASULGC President, C. Peter Magrath, among others.&nbsp; Magrath's comments

        &quot;College Is Possible Campaign&quot;<br>
        C. Peter Magrath<br>
        President, National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges <br>
        October 27, 1998</b></p>
        <p>It costs money to go to college. We all know that. But it costs far less than many
        people think, and that is why we are here today for the College Is Possible campaign. This
        is a campaign to educate more people about college affordability and financial aid, and
        we&#146;re pleased that over 1,000 colleges and universities have already decided to join
        this campaign.</p>
        <p>Many of those who have joined the College Is Possible network, I&#146;m pleased to say,
        are among America&#146;s public colleges and universities-- the state colleges and
        land-grant universities that are members of the National Association of State Universities
        and Land-Grant Colleges (NASULGC), and the American Association of State Colleges and
        Universities (AASCU). We are encouraging those schools that haven&#146;t yet joined the
        network to sign up now! We want them to join us in getting the message out to the public
        that college is affordable; that it costs far less than they may think; and that there are
        many places to go to find out how to get financial aid.</p>
        <p>I want to emphasize three facts: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            </font><p><font FACE="Times Roman"><b>Over half of all students attend universities that
            charge less than $4,000--the average tuition for full-time undergraduates at public
            four-year universities this year was $3,243;</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Seven out of ten full-time students receive some form of financial aid;</p>
            <p>When loans and work-study are added, financial aid covers about 40 percent of full-time
            students&#146; budgets.</b></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Universities are taking great steps to keep costs down. At public universities and
        colleges, our mission is clear--we were created to serve the public; to see that access
        and opportunity is available for all who can benefit from a college education; and to
        ensure increased access--especially to low income communities.</p>
        <p>A college education, unfortunately, is not cost free. But it&#146;s far less costly
        than many believe. And for all motivated Americans there is <u>another cost</u> to
        consider: the cost of <u>not</u> going to college.</p>
        <p>A college education is the best single investment anyone can make--enriching you
        personally as a human being and economically as a productive citizen. The message is this:
        you can&#146;t afford to miss college--and you can afford to go.</p>
