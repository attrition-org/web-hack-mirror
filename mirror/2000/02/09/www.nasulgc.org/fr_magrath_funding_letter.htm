    from NASULGC President C. Peter Magrath to House and Senate leaders on behalf of member
    insitutions urging sustaining funding for research and student financial assistance
    programs.</big></strong><p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>August 3, 1999</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Honorable Thomas A. Daschle<br>
    United States Senate<br>
    509 Senate Hart Office Building<br>
    Washington, D.C. 20510</p>
    <p>Dear Senator Daschle:</p>
    <p>I am writing to you on behalf of the 203 research-intensive public universities,
    including the University of South Dakota and South Dakota State University that comprise
    the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges. As Congress
    continues to deliberate the FY2000 budget, the NASULGC institutions urge you and your
    colleagues to sustain the federal investment in research and student financial assistance
    that has been a crucial element in the prosperity and growth experienced by our nation
    over the past fifty years.</p>
    <p>The institutions listed below have a long tradition of serving our nation, states, and
    communities as partners in education and economic development. We have always done so in
    partnership with the federal government, which has provided critical resources throughout
    the long history of public higher education. We are now deeply troubled that the current
    fiscal contraints outlined in the Balanced Budget Act will seriously weaken the
    partnership. Significant reductions in the federal commitment to research and financial
    aid programs could impair the ability of our institutions to generate the research
    advances and skilled workforce that have been linchpins in our nation&#146;s economic
    growth and development.</p>
    <p>In this era of economic prosperity and projected budget surpluses, we believe that now
    is the time to bolster the federal investment in our future. Faculty and scholars on our
    campuses are on the verge of discoveries that will help propel our nation even more
    forward in the next century. Advances in such areas as biomedical and health sciences,
    information technology, and defense technologies would be severely compromised under the
    current budget regimen. But if the budget restraints can be eased, we will have the vital
    resources to enable us as a nation to continue our economic development and prosperity.</p>
    <p>We appreciate your thoughtful consideration of our concerns and look forward to working
    with you on this critical issue.</p>
