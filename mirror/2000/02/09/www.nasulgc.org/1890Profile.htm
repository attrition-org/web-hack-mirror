    <td width="70%">Thirty-two years following passage of the <a href="landgrtAct1.htm">Justin
    Smith Morrill Act of 1862</a>, Congress passed the <a href="landgrtAct2.htm">1890 Morrill
    Act</a> creating black land-grant colleges and universities. Today, the rich legacy of the
    land-grant tradition remains prominent on the campuses of 17 public black colleges and
    universities including Tuskegee University, a private, state-related land-grant
    institution. The University of the District of Columbia and the University of the Virgin
    Islands were established under the 1862 Morrill Act.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The most striking testimonial to the resilience and value of black land-grant
        institutions is the prominence of the leaders they produce in all fields of
        endeavors--leaders such as: <br>
        <ul>
          <li>John Stallworth, former wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers and successful
            businessman, Alabama A&amp;M University.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Wiley Austin Branton, Sr. nationally recognized civil-rights attorney and confidant to
            Associate Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.<br>
          </li>

            A&amp;T State University.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Congressman Harold Ford, U.S. House of Representatives, Tennessee State University.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Wilma Rudolph, the first American woman to win three Olympic gold medals, Tennessee
            State University.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Three of the largest black universities in the nation are black land-grant institutions:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>University of the District of Columbia</li>
          <li>Florida A&amp;M University </li>
          <li>Southern University and A&amp;M College<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Alabama A&amp;M University, Florida A&amp;M University, North Carolina A&amp;T State
        University, South Carolina State University, Southern University &amp; A&amp;M College,
        Tennessee State University, Tuskegee University and the University of Maryland Eastern
        Shore offer doctorates and/or professional degrees in one or more of the following
        disciplines: <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Engineering</li>
          <li>Food Sciences</li>
          <li>Law</li>
          <li>Pharmaceutical Sciences</li>
          <li>Physics</li>
          <li>Plant and Soil Sciences</li>
          <li>Toxicology</li>
          <li>Veterinary Medicine<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Black land-grant institutions are located in 18 states, the District of Columbia and the
        U.S. Virgin Islands.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Black land-grant institutions annually enroll nearly 40 percent of all students in
        four-year historically black colleges and universities. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Black land-grant institutions are prominent among research institutions in:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>the field of animal sciences</li>
          <li>sustainable agriculture and agriculture economics</li>
          <li>toxicology and waste management</li>
          <li>conservation and environmental management</li>
          <li>business and industrial development</li>
          <li>biomedical science</li>
          <li>food and nutrition</li>
          <li>plant and social sciences</li>
          <li>international development<br>
            <br>
            These institutions have studied ways to boost the productivity of grain legumes--peanuts,
            soybeans, pigeon peas and dry beans--to help alleviate poverty in developing nations;
            synthesized a series of oxygen-carrying protein complexes that have the potential to serve
            as blood substitutes in the treatment of sickle cell anemia; and developed new composite
            alloys for use in outer space and earth-based activities.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A few of the research facilities at black land-grant institutions include a center for
        the application of remote sensing; Claude E. Phillips Herbarium; biomedical research;
        environmental technology; silicon fabrication; water resources engineering and food
        microbiology/nutrition.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Three of the top five black institutions in the nation contributing to the production of
        African American doctorates are black land-grant universities:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Florida A&amp;M University</li>
          <li>Tennessee State University</li>
          <li>Southern University &amp; A&amp;M College</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
