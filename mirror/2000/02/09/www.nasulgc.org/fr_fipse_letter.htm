      <p>The Honorable Arlen Specter<br>
      Chair, Labor, Health and Human Services,<br>
      Education Appropriations Subcommittee<br>
      184 Dirksen Senate Office Building <br>
      Washington, DC 20510</p>
      <p>Dear Senator Specter:</p>
      <p>Last week the Department of Education announced the cancellation of the Fund for the
      Improvement of Postsecondary Education's (FIPSE) 1999 Comprehensive Grant Competition. We
      write to share our deep concern for the impact this will have on the nation&#146;s
      colleges and universities. </p>
      <p>FIPSE is the single federal program designed to foster innovation in colleges and
      universities. Over the years, it has supported creative and productive projects and had an
      enormously beneficial impact. In recent years, for example, FIPSE has emphasized distance
      education, faculty development, and student-centered learning. Last year, three of the
      four Hesburgh awards -- recognition given annually by TIAA-CREF to institutions that
      implement the most effective initiatives to improve student learning -- went to projects
      that were initially funded by FIPSE. </p>
      <p>By its very nature FIPSE is a highly flexible program. It is a small grant-making
      entity with considerable autonomy to establish its priorities within a large bureaucracy.
      For 25 years, FIPSE has supported peer-reviewed, field-initiated projects that pursue
      priorities established by the FIPSE Board. The projects that receive funding are those
      with the greatest potential to improve postsecondary education. Support goes to all types
      of colleges and universities in all states. The innovative projects selected for support
      have an important multiplier effect through widespread dissemination of outcomes
      throughout the university community. Through Republican and Democratic administrations
      alike, FIPSE has pursued its work admirably and without controversy.</p>
      <p>The decision to cancel this year&#146;s competition means that 1,700 pending
      applications in hundred of colleges and universities from coast to coast will be
      discarded. Most federal grant applicants have had the experience of not getting a grant
      because their proposal did not survive the rigors of peer review. However, having an
      application rejected because the agency decides it does not have resources to fund <u>any</u>
      projects &#150; no matter how deserving &#150; is an unexpected and unfortunate outcome.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;We strongly encourage the provision of additional funding for FIPSE to permit the
      Department to reinstate the FY 1999 competition. Such a step could be taken through a
      supplemental funding bill. More generally, we ask that, in the future, FIPSE be authorized
      to adhere to its established procedures designed to make grants based solely on the
      quality of the proposals as determined by peer review. </p>
      <p>FIPSE has been an exemplary agency for 25 years. With your assistance, we believe it
      will play a similarly effective and important role in the future. Thank you for your
      consideration of this important matter. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Sincerely, </p>
