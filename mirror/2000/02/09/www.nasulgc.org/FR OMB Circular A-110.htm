  <p>Mr. F. James Charney<br>
  Policy Analyst<br>
  Office of Management and Budget<br>
  Room 6025<br>
  New Executive Office Building<br>
  Washington D.C. 20503</p>
  <p>Dear Mr. Charney:</p>
  <p>This letter is submitted on behalf of the National Association of State Universities
  and Land-Grant Colleges (NASULGC) and the American Association of State Colleges and
  Universities (AASCU) representing over 500 public colleges and universities on the
  proposed revision to OMB Circular A-110 published in the Federal Register of February 4,
  1999. </p>
  <p>It is not a simple task to balance the nation&#146;s commitment to responsible
  cutting-edge research and the public&#146;s appropriate demand for the free-flow of
  information especially when it is funded by the taxpayer. Developing a responsible federal
  data sharing policy as addressed in A-110 is of extreme importance to our member
  institutions. We, therefore, are pleased to have the opportunity to comment on proposed
  A-110 and be a part of the process to balance our joint goals.</p>
  <p>First, we register strong support for freedom of information. Without question, the
  public deserves access to research that its taxes have funded. Conducting research and
  making it of use to the citizenry is one of the primary goals of our institutions. In our
  own self interest, universities and researchers want maximum dissemination of all research
  and appropriate credit for their efforts. </p>
  <p>Secondly, we register an equally strong commitment to research integrity. Sound
  research conducted efficiently serves the taxpayer best. It is a reasonable expectation of
  the researcher and the public that federal law support responsible and reliable research.
  Further, we feel that it is a university responsibility to protect research integrity.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;You will receive many letters from research universities and associations that
  relay concrete examples of possible unintended ramifications of proposed A-110. In
  particular, we register our support for the well-documented and thoughtful letter from the
  Association of American Universities. We believe that several general points are worth
  reiteration:</p>
  <u><p>Timing concerns</u> -- The premature release of research data (that is, release
  while research is ongoing) can potentially result in under informed and faulty
  interpretations by observers; constrictions on the research process that could impact the
  quality of a research project; and delays in the research process resulting from responses
  to requests.</p>
  <u><p>Intellectual Property concerns</u> -- Because publicly disclosed information is not
  eligible for foreign patents, U.S. scientists would be put in at a unique disadvantage if
  results are prematurely disclosed. Additionally, the willingness of business and industry
  to form research partnerships with universities could decrease due to questions that would
  certainly be raised regarding the ownership of intellectual property. This problem is
  magnified because federal funding increasingly requires business and industry
  partnerships. </p>
  <u><p>Confidentiality conflicts</u> -- Some medical and psychological protocols require
  the collection of confidential data. If this confidentiality is lost, the pool of subjects
  could shrink to the point that some research projects became unreliable.</p>
  <p>We believe that these potential problems would be unintended consequences of the
  proposed A-110 revisions. This is a set of complex issues that are of great importance to
  research universities and, ultimately, the public. We, therefore, join in supporting the
  recommendation that the National Academy of Sciences study the federal data sharing policy
  issue and report back with recommendations that take into account freedom of information
  and research integrity.</p>
  <p>Thank you for this opportunity to comment and your attention to these concerns. </p>
  <p>Cordially,</p>
  <p>James B. Appleberry
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.

  NASULGC</p>
