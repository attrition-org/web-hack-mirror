    ABOUT IMPACT OF BINGE DRINKING</font><font size="3"><p><font face="Times New Roman">WASHINGTON,
    D.C. &#151; A national campaign aimed at raising public awareness of the dangers of
    high-risk and binge drinking by young people is being launched by the National Association
    of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges (NASULGC), 113 member institutions, and the
    Kellogg Commission on the Future of State and Land-Grant Universities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Full-page advertisements will appear in dozens of
    newspapers around the country starting September 10, including the <i>New York Times, USA
    Today, </i>the<i> Wall Street Journal, </i>the<i> Los Angeles Times, </i>and the <i>Chicago
    Tribune.</font></p>
    <p></i><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to the advertisements, a web site, a
    &quot;best practices&quot; brochure highlighting campus programs to combat binge drinking
    and other information have been created to focus on this public health issue.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Young people today are dying as a result of high
    risk and binge drinking. Others&#146; lives are in jeopardy. We hope that by drawing
    attention to the issue, the general public will join us in looking for ways to curb this
    horrible problem,&quot; said C. Peter Magrath, president of NASULGC. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Our campuses are working hard, but we can&#146;t
    solve the problem alone. Too many students come to us as problem drinkers. Nearly
    one-third of college students start as binge drinkers in high school, and binge drinking
    has become a destructive way of life for too many college students,&quot; Magrath said.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Binge drinking is defined as the consumption of five or
    more drinks in one sitting by a male, or four or more drinks by a female. According to a
    national survey, more than 40 percent of today&#146;s college students binge&#151;20
    percent of them three or more times in a two-week period. More than half of the students
    who use alcohol say they drink to get drunk. Alcohol is a factor in 40 percent of all
    academic problems and 28 percent of all dropouts.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The public-awareness campaign was the idea of Graham
    Spanier, President of the Pennsylvania State University and chair of the Kellogg
    Commission, a panel of NASULGC presidents and external advisors that is issuing a series
    of open letters recommending ways public universities can adapt to better serve society.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Universities throughout America have signed on to support
    the campaign and, besides the ads in national and large daily newspapers, are purchasing
    full-page ads in their local and student newspapers. Ads also will be published this fall
    in college football programs and other publications.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The national-awareness campaign is being funded through
    donations by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Barnes &amp; Noble, Inc., and through
    funds contributed by the participating institutions. The ads appearing in national and
    major city papers were developed pro bono by the Philadelphia-based ad agency Tierney and
    Partners, a True North Company.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Many of us on college campuses and in the local
    communities where our institutions are located have been focusing on the problem of high
    risk, binge drinking for several years now,&quot; said Spanier. &quot;But if we are going
    to succeed in addressing this public health issue, we need the interest and support of the
    general public.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It is not unusual for students who come to our
    colleges and universities to already be experienced binge drinkers. It may be too late for
    some of these students if we wait until they begin college to attempt to address the
    problem,&quot; Spanier said. &quot;Too many students are ending up in the emergency rooms
    of local hospitals; students are dropping out of college before graduating; and much of
    the crime involving college students&#151;including assaults, vandalism, disorderly
    conduct, and sexual assault&#151;are related to the excessive consumption of
    alcohol.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If we can reduce the amount of high-risk drinking
    taking place we can save lives and we can make our communities safer places,&quot; Spanier
    said.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Penn State took the lead role in raising the funds that
    are helping to pay for this public-awareness campaign, and University staff are
    coordinating the effort with NASULGC.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one thing comes out of this, we hope it is that
    more parents talk to their children about the dangers of binge drinking&#151;the dangers
    to their health, their academic careers, their futures,&quot; said NASULGC&#146;s Magrath.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Added Spanier, &quot;It is important to understand
    that the kind of drinking going on today is very different from what parents might
    remember when they attended high school or college. For some young people it is drinking
    with the sole purpose of getting intoxicated.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many good web sites in existence that address
    issues related to binge drinking and alcohol abuse in general. To assist the public
    awareness campaign, a web site has been created with links to many valuable resources
    around the country, at <a HREF="BingeDrink/Default.htm">www.nasulgc.org/bingedrink</a>.
    &nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I believe the vast majority of students welcome the
    chance to be responsible,&quot; Spanier said. &quot;They need our encouragement and
    support.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">Founded in 1887, the National Association of State
    Universities and Land-Grant Colleges is a voluntary association of public research
    universities, land-grant institutions, and many state university systems. Its members
    enroll more than 3.2 million students, award approximately a half-million degrees
    annually, and have an estimated 20 million alumni.</font></small></p>
