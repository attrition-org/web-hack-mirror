    Commission on Human Resources and Social Change (CHRSC) monitors a broad range of
    legislative and policy interests and seeks to exercise leadership in anticipating and
    identifying national policies and practices that may impact on the role of higher
    education in relation to human resources and social change. These interests may include: <ul>
      <li><a href="#Department of Education">Department of Education- Federal Pell Grant Program</a></li>
      <li>Patricia Robert Harris Fellowships</li>
      <li>National Graduate Fellows Program (Javits Fellowships)</li>
      <li>Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GANN) </li>

    <br>
    The Commission has worked with other higher education associations in sustaining and
    increasing the nation's investment in the Federal Pell Grants Program. It has supported
    sustaining race-based scholarships, fellowships, traineeships and other forms of student
    assistance as a means of creating greater opportunity in disciplines indicating a
    disproportionate underrepresentation of minorities. Given the underrepresentation of
    minorities in advanced degree programs and particularly in the sciences, the Commission
    has supported continuation of Patricia Robert Harris Fellowships and the National Graduate
    Fellows Program (Javits Fellowships). <br>
    <br>
    For the upcoming program year, the Commission has agreed to focus on the changing role of
    faculty in higher education with particular emphasis on framing programs and policies that
    may increase minorities in the academy. Thus, the Commission will play a major role in
    pushing for the expansion of faculty development programs in the Department of Education
    and beyond. <br>

    The Commission played a key leadership role with the executive branch in shaping
    legislation for the creation of the National and Community Service Program. A policy paper
    on the role of higher education in advancing community service was widely distributed to
    congressional and policy makers.<br>

    </a>The Commission worked with the Woods Hole scientific community in planning a national
    conference designed to create new and innovative policies and programs to recruit
    minorities in oceanography and related disciplines. The conference was sponsored under the
    aegis of NOAA. In addition, staff presented a paper on the subject at a Black History
    Celebration in Woods Hole.<br>

    The Commission has submitted comments on proposed regulations and budget mandates under
    the aegis of the National Science Foundation, primarily focusing on initiatives designed
    to strengthen relationships between higher education and secondary schools in improving
    the quality of science education. The Commission met with the leadership of Education and
    Human Resources of NSF in developing a national study on undergraduate education in
    SME&amp;T and submitted comments on the final study--&quot;Shaping the Future: New
    Expectations for Undergraduate Education in SME&amp;T.&quot; Given the pivotal role of
    higher education in sustaining strong undergraduate programs in the science, staff will
    continue to work with NSF in finding ways to implement recommendations in the study
    offering the greatest potential for change. <br>

      <li>Periodically, the Commission sponsors summer programs designed to share information and
        expertise concerning educational and social policies and practices that enhance
        opportunities for minorities in higher education. The Commission provides input at
        national and state higher education meetings, prepares congressional testimony and policy
        papers on issues of national importance to higher education and conducts research on
        issues pertinent to human resources and social change. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Commission leadership and staff served on a study Panel on Educational Opportunity and
        Postsecondary Desegregation, sponsored by the Southern Education Foundation, an
        Atlanta-based organization with more than 25 years of advocacy experience. The panel was
        charged with the responsibility of examining the &quot;legal mandate to desegregate
        postsecondary institutions as a gateway to the larger and more compelling issues of
        assuring expanded opportunities for minorities in a reformed system of public higher
        education.&quot; Thus, in an 18-month investigation, the panel studied the constitutional
        and legal ramifications of Fordice through research, hearings and extension discussions
        with national and state leaders in the civil rights and higher education community. The
        panel's final report, Redeeming the American Promise, was released in 1995.</li>
