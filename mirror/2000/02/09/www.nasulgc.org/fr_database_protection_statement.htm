<h1>Intellectual Property, Copyright Protection and Fair Use<font color="#000080"><br>
</font><img src="RWB_LINE.gif" width="590" height="10"></h1>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>

    <p ALIGN="CENTER">Position Statement</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The corporations, educational institutions, non-profit organizations
    and trade associations listed below are users as well as creators in the compilation and
    value-added transformation of databases. The Information Age and digital technology
    provide researchers and consumers across the globe with a unique opportunity to continue
    to create, maintain, and use new and innovative databases that are essential to science,
    education, business, and the overall economy. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because databases are items of commerce in their own right, and are
    critical tools for facilitating electronic commerce, research and education endeavors, we
    support Federal legislation carefully tailored to provide database publishers with
    sufficient protection against incentive-eliminating piracy. Conversely, we oppose
    legislation which would grant the compiler of any information an unprecedented right to
    control transformative, value-added, downstream uses of the resulting collection or of any
    useful fraction of that collection.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The basic information policy of this country &#150; a policy that has
    existed since the writing of the Constitution &#150; has served us extremely well. The
    policy is that the building blocks of all information &#150; facts, as distinct from the
    copyrightable manner in which they are expressed &#150; cannot be owned. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The particular legislative approach that has been considered by the
    House Judiciary Committee in the past three Congresses would mark a fundamental change in
    our nation's information policy. The problems raised by this change to commerce and
    competition were recognized by the Department of Justice, the Department of Commerce, and
    the Federal Trade Commission last year in separate letters to Congress identifying their
    concerns with H.R. 2652 considered by the 105th Congress. H.R. 354, the Collections of
    Information Antipiracy Act, is modeled on last year&#146;s bill and does not resolve these
    concerns.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We support Federal legislation that will not harm legitimate research
    activities and small businesses, but will - </p>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>prevent unfair competition in the form of parasitic copying; </li>
        <li>preserve the fair use of information;</li>
        <li>promote the progress of science, education and research; </li>
        <li>protect value-added publishers and their customers; and </li>
        <li>provide safeguards against monopolistic pricing.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We look forward to working closely with all Members of Congress to
    craft well-reasoned, targeted and balanced legislation that will punish database pirates
    without jeopardizing the thriving commerce in information long at the core of America's
    economic, scientific and intellectual life.</p>
