What Is? is not intended to constitute legal advice. What Is? is a public service offering 
general information about criminal proceedings. If you are facing 
criminal charges, you should consult an attorney. Every case is different. Only an attorney 
who is aware of your specific circumstances can give competent answers to your questions. 
If you do not have an attorney, may we suggest that you contact your 
<a href="../bardir.html">local bar association's</a> 
referral service. The topics covered in What Is? provide only very basic information and should 
not be substituted for legal advice from an attorney. </P>
