<blockquote>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Capital Division of the Tennessee Public Defenders
Conference consists of its Chief Counsel, <A HREF="mailto:DaveKeefe@aol.com">David
Keefe</A>, Deputy Counsel <a href="mailto:jtdorsey@usit.net">Jefferson  
Dorsey</a>, and 
the Administrative Assistant and Office Manager, Leigh Smith. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Capital Division is mandated to assist any attorneys--not
just public defenders--who are assigned as counsel in a capital case. 
LWOP cases are methodologically similar to death cases, and we 
therefore treat them as death cases for purposes of our mission. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Our job is to confer with trial attorneys on every stage
of trial, from earliest investigation and planning through direct appeal. We 
maintain contact with death-penalty lawyers, mitigation workers 
and other resources so we can help attorneys who are unsure 
where or how to obtain necessary resources for their cases.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We also assist lawyers in researching death penalty-related
issues, and are building a library based upon the fruits of that research 
which is available to all Tennessee defense attorneys upon request. 
We will also place drafts of selected pleadings and briefs on the 
Conference's BBS and the <A 
HREF="http://www.tncrimlaw.com/tacdl">TACDL
Brief Bank</A> web page so that interested attorneys
who are members of TACDL may download them 
at their convenience.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Capital Division publishes a bulletin, The
Fight For Life, which is sent free of charge to defense attorneys throughout the
state who are interested in capital litigation. We encourage input 
from any attorney who wishes to contribute to maintaining or raising 
the standards of practice in this area of the law. If you are not 
receiving The Fight For Life, please <A HREF="mailto:capitalpd@tncrimlaw.com">email</A>
or <a href="#ph">call</a> the Capital Division 
and we will add you to our mailing list. 
<A HREF="http://www.tncrimlaw.com/tacdl">TACDL members</A> may 
search by keyword(s) and read the <A HREF="fight.html">The
Fight For Life library</A> online.</FONT></P>
