  You have been <font color="#FF6666"><b>rooted</b></font>.<br>
  This server had low security and should have been shutdown.<br>
  We exploited your server through the <i>telnetd</i> hole.<br>
  We have secured this box, and there should be no further problems with
your 
  system.<br>
  We have also modified the logs of us ever being here ... <i>You're
welcome</i>...<br>
  We did not intend to harm you in any way, but rather wanted to help you
with 
  this insecurity<br>
  to defend you from so called &quot;<b>SCRIPT KIDDIES</b>&quot;.<br>
  The index file has been backed up by you so there should be no
problem<br>
  of recovering this site.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Shouts go to: #2600, #crontab &amp; #Pots<br>
