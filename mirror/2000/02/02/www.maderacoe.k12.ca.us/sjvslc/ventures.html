<P>The purpose of the Ventures Program is to enable participants to
engage others in creating an environment in which powerful learning
is experienced by all learners systematically and consistently. The
Ventures Program is intended for school leaders at all levels who are
in positions to bring about significant changes in their schools or
districts.</P>

<P>The Ventures Program consists of twelve core seminars and eight
special focus seminars over three years, plus an optional year of
coaching and support seminars in which the participants are expected
to implement significant change efforts in their schools or
districts.<BR>

</I></B></FONT>CSLA's Ventures Program is one of a kind. Known for
ten years as the premier support system for California principals and
school leaders, CSLA has designed this new program for senior
associates and site principals to support the creation of 21st
Century schools that are founded upon powerful learning for all
students. It combines the restructuring research and practice on the
national level with the experience from CSLA's original Foundation
Program and School Leadership Team Seminars.<BR>
