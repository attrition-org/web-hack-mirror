<P>The purpose of the CSLA School Leadership Team Development Program
is to develop the capacity of school teams to facilitate actions
within their schools that lead to powerful learning for all members
of the organization. This program offers seminars to school teams who
are willing to make a long term commitment to facilitating the
improvement of learning opportunities within their schools.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Goal<BR>
</B></FONT><I>Participants will engage in collaborative work to
redesign learning opportunities and to reconstruct existing school
structures that lead to continuous improvement in student
learning.</I></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>What the School Leadership Team Program can do
for you!<BR>
</B></FONT>Initiating and implementing whole-school change
necessitates a clear process towards specific goals. The program
seminars provides avenues for discussing implementation of a change
process, shaping the culture to support continuous improvement,
working through resistance, creating a powerful vision, developing
shared decision making, and designing a curriculum for powerful
student learning.</P>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Who Should Participate:<BR>
</B></FONT>School Leadership Teams are composed of a consistent group
of 6-12 members who are critical to the success of school
improvement. Teams are generally 5 (small elementary schools) to 12
(large high schools) members. The principal must be a member of the
team and must attend all seminars or the team does not attend. In
addition, a district office administrator must also attend all SLT
seminars (same D.O. administrator) and do intersession work. Other
team members might be teachers, counselors, co-administrators,
parents, central office staff, board members, and students (high
school teams).</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Length of Program:<BR>

days per year for a two-year period.</P>
