<p>One grade A manifesto:</p>
<p>OK, to start out with I'm going to ask you a question that most of you haven't taken the time (or had the reason) to ask yourselves.  Are computer hackers really as bad as you see them?  Now hold on,  catch your breath for a second and read on..<br>
If we take a quick moment to think,  can we really have light without darkness?  Joy without sorrow?  Freedom without imprisonment?  No,  of course not.  What would we have to compare our state of mind to, in order to decide where we are?&nbsp;<br>
   Also,  if there were no computer hackers searching for problems in the software that we all love and use so often,  why would we think of improving it?  What real reasons would there be to improve the current version of whatever you're running?  Say someone finds a tiny exploit in a new piece of software going out on the market and gaining acceptance by more and more people.  His exploiting this bug, and sending out the message that it exist does cause the bad guys ears to perk up, true.  But however, it also causes the companies to spew forth a new version of "Really Cool Program 2000,"  causing a bigger grin than the last time you used it most likely, and a more secure operating system, and now a more secure network than before.  There will always be new exploits as long as humans are imperfect,  because no imperfect being can write "perfect code."  This also brings me to the interesting point of WHY exploits exist.  Is it really the hacker's total fault your system was accessed?  Not really.  Mega companies have deadlines, and deadlines have to be met.  This can cause hasty work and problems left unsolved, so what happens next?  Out on the shelves it goes,  flaw an all.  What next?  You know what comes next.. You buy the program and run it, and complain that some malicious nobody accessed all of your "top secret" material or whatever the circumstance may be.  Now, to reflect back to my past topic, whereas if Johnny D. Programmer never made that mistake,  a new version would not have been made with possible new features, and possibly more bugs fixed.  So as you can see, the problem lies in the middle of the court (or generally on the programmer's side).  Take a look at Microsoft NT,  everyone has heard of Microsoft.  Has everyone heard that most of the networks defaced and all are windows NT and not smaller companies?  Take a look at attrition.org's statistics.   Also, as to why computer hackers even exist, is because there are always people better in the game than the rest.  There are better artists than some, as well as better basketball players.  We all can't be in the NBA now, can we?  No, we can't,  just like we can't have the Internet operating at the same level.  Should we ridicule all of those that are better?  Outlaw the professional basketball players because they make 10 mil. more than us, or even make us look bad at times?  It's foolish to think we could effect a number of people, let alone take action ourselves say we even wanted to.  How can corporate America gripe about a recent attack when they spent all of their time and money on updating hardware, such as buying new routers, and expanding clusters, etc.?  It's likely that a single thought was not processed as to whether the company needs security updates, and no folks, your average hotfix with all of it's widely known exploits (after all,  what about the little guys that could lead to a breech in the network's security)?  Expand your viewpoint, fellow citizens of the world, and fellow computer users just the same.  Heed my words,  no hackers will ever be stopped as a whole,  only bits and pieces.  Corporations will never care about it's customers, only about deadlines and profits.  It's all a list of givens.  We're stuck in a cycle, and the public has your attention diverted to a side effect of the problems they cause for you all.  Have you ever thought about if you're reading what they want to to read?  Ever hear the words "media sensationalism" come from a media broadcaster's mouth?  Didn't think so.  One final note to leave with.  It almost made me crack up laughing when I read that the attacks made were so simple that they could be "launched by a fifteen year old boy".  This goes to show you how far offbeat the government, not to forget the general public's viewpoint is.  Hackers/crackers are mainly in their young teens,  atleast all of the ones I've encountered in my short time on earth.  I myself am fifteen, and I'm a boy.  That makes me a fifteen year old boy who can launch a DoS attack and destroy the government.  Time to break out the concentration camps everybody!  heh heh.  To be serious for a second.  Hackers mainly do what they do for a while, and grow out of it and then wind up helping the community without hacking or cracking as you may call it, or whatever it applies to.  It's a foolish stereotype that because kids are kids, we're simple minded and a waste of bandwidth.  We the kids SHAPE your Internet, and however you wish to contort that is up to you.  I am not angry, nor am I saddened by our situation we're in.  That's human nature for you,  greedy on both ends.  "Fix it for me,  make it better for me or I'll throw a fit."  Well,  I don't see a fix any time soon, so you'd better not be spending many late nights typing about how your security was breached, because no one cares about YOU.  They care about your money, and that my friends, is why you have the shoddy operating systems and software you all use.  Think for yourselves, and do some research for yourselves.  The media isn't necessarily right all of the time,  and maybe I'm not either,  but that's for you to think about, and me not to care about.  I'm not going to be spending thousands on the damage caused by someone with spare time and a newly found exploit.  Have fun, and enjoy the ride known as e-commerce, the most insecure method of commerce, where hundreds apon thousands can view your credit card numbers, stored in plain text that you and I can read, right there where it can be accessed if you know what you're doing.  I won't go into how, but think about if you're really as sure as you were before you read this.   -Opiat3</p>
