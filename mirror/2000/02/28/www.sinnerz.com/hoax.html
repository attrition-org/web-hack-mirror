        Nethoaxing, a leading national provider of affordable business and 
personal internet domains for the world wide web, just announced a new 
employee design which would allow Nethoaxing to provide cheaper rates to its 
customers. In a brilliant management move, Nethoaxing laid off all of its 
unnecessary support and billing employees, which constituted the company's 
largest expenses. In their stead, Nethoaxing hired replacement top-qualified 
brown and black-coated Swahili chimpanzees. One Nethoaxing representative 
beams brightly describing the role of Toppo, a new hiree: "Toppo weighs in at 
170 pounds and has a shiny coat. That's a very important quality in this 
business." Toppo also affirmed his commitment to the company and its 
policies. "Ooo oo ieee a," he exclaimed while baring his teeth in 
anticipation, phelgm dribbling down his chin.
<br>
<br>
        "These new chimpanzees have been a great investment," Nethoaxing 
states. "Instead of wasting customer money hiring human beings to rack their 
brains, thinking of excuses for why our servers are down and why we haven't 
set up their domains after 3 weeks, we have apes whom we can hire to say 
equally meaningless bullshit for hundreds less bananas a day." Nethoaxing 
declined to comment on the situation of families of laid-off employees who 
no longer have bananas to eat.
<br><br>
        One ex-Nethoaxing employee expressed his outrage at the recent 
layoffs. "Those guys can't do this!" he said, whining pointedly. "I'm 
forever, you bastards!" he exclaimed as a 13 year-old boy stole his pocket 
protector and smashed his glasses under his shoe.
<br><br>
        "Humans may have evolved from our fellow chimpanzees. In 10 million 
years, these creatures will be our intellectual equals!" Nethoaxing affirms.  
Nethoaxing also notes that is about how long it currently takes them to 
process an order for domain setup.
