KNOXVILLE, TN, Sequoya Elementary: Riots broke out today as children and
teachers alike broke out in what was to be the most obnoxious argument on
the planet. One of the teachers said Santa Claus wasn't real, and the
children decided to attack the teacher with toy powertools from the wood
shop. "Once the kids jumped up on me, I started to beat one in the face with
a ruler, but they just overcrowded me." This teacher hit the intercom and
screamed for help as the children stepped all over her.
<br>
<br>    
The riots ended quickly as the police entered the building and riddled
teachers and students alike with shotgun shot and .9mm bullets. Sheriff
Jerome Bigsby says, "We did what was necessary. Once one of the students
came after an officer with a plastic hammer, they had gone too far. We had
to act immediately and decisively."
<br>
<br>
One of the parents, who's child survived with only mild brain damage and a
gun shot wound to the heart, spoke at a press meeting today, "What these
kids need is discipline. Just because someone put their closely held beliefs
under fire, they don't need to over react." The woman later in the day shot
a man because he criticized her style of clothing.

<br><br>
The principal also spoke out against these riots, "I think what we need is
stricter rules around the school. From this day forward, plastic saws,
hammers, wrenches, and other paraphenelia are banned from the school." When
questioned about why the teacher try to change their beliefs, he shifted his
eyes quickly and stated, "I need a bathroom break." He has been missing for
three days.
