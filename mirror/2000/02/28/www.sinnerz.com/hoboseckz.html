A local hobo, known only as "Mack," was seen groping, fondling,
and even engaging in intercourse with several geese.  When sought for
questioning he would only reply, "Goggle pant zipper king!" Whatever in
the hell that means. The witnesses was a gay couple from Vermont, Steve
& Ted, and a triplet of girls. When the gay couple were questioned they
said , "Uh, yeah, mayuhn, we was holding hands den all of a sudden this
fella here comes up and starts a-fuckin the geese and all dat" while his
partner nodded his head slowly.  The girls said, "Give us candy or we
won't answer." Obviously, we had no candy.
<br>
<br>    
So what do the police plan to do about it? "Well, next time we
get a call for a 'transient' we will beat the hell of them and throw 
them in a deep rivah, yassuh."  They will kill all hobos on this "Hobo
Holocaust of 2000."  
<br>
<br>
The local hobo was also reported to have fondled pidgeons under
the city bridges. Tim Worthy testifies, "I saw a goht dahm pidgeon
with a hobo-lookin head! I swar, thayut was the wardest thang i ever
deeyuhd see."  That is just nasty, you dirty , dirty hobo. Go to hell.
