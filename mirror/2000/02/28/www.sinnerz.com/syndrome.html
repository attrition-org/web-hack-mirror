CREIGHTON, MISSISSIPPI- In a startling change of doctrine, Reverend John D. Nixon
of Creighton Southern Baptist Church announched a new policy of tolerance toward
disadvantaged children.  "We have come to beee-lieve," Reverend Nixon bellowed, "that,
according to the bible, God does not hate ree-tards. At least not retarded children."
<br>
<br>            This controversial change occured when a member of the Crieghton congregation
gave birth to a down-syndrome child, Isaac Lucius. Mrs. Lucius, eyes tearing with joy,
tells her story. "I know Jesus wouldn't reject my baby-boy after I sold my precious
mobile home and donated the money to God. Now I have to sell my body to make ends
meet, but the Reverend says that because my body is a temple, Jesus has no objections
to a negro crack-dealer penetrating my anus. As long as I donate the earnings to
the Creighton congregation, of course."  Mrs Lucius is also proud that her son is 
now allowed to handle poisonous snakes as a test of his faith, knowing that Jesus
would protect him from being bitten. "My other two sons, Matthew and Luke, died 
of venom wounds at the devil-tempting ages of two and four. They had to have been 
evil little boys, but I know Jesus, our Savior, loves this one." 
<br>
<br>
        Reverend Nixon admits he was at first skeptical of admitting little Isaac.
"At first, I naturally thought he was an abomination from Satan! But then God came 
to me, in a vision, and said to me, 'He who shalt donate his heart, soul, and all 
of his paycheck to me, is my disciple.' I then knew that Isaac was His chosen
one."  Reverend Nixon has also just purchased a $500,000 home for his family.

<br><br>Reverend Nixon assures that nothing else in the Southern Baptist dogma
has changed. "God still hates black people, AIDS victims, democrats, and homosexuals; 
and commands us, as his children, to burn their homes and rape their families. Those
goddamn devil-worshipping atheists are still going to hell, too."  When told that
atheists do not believe in the devil either, the reverend replied, "I've got a right
to be ignorant. I'm a god-fearing American, you cocky jap-loving bastard!"
