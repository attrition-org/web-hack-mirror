I can't stand hypocrites. Even though I know at some point I have been a 
hypocrite myself, it doesn't mean I still can't dislike them.. cuz I do! So 
what is up with freedom of speech these days anyway? You hear all these 
people talk about their rights and how freedom of speech is so important, 
but when it comes to people saying something about them, the first thing 
they want to do is stop them.

Let's start with JP. Most people know of JP, the owner of antionline.com. 
People shouldn't know of him, but since he is such a media whore (that is my 
personal opinion anyways) a lot of people do. Recently, we had an article on 
the news page called "Enilno Itna Founder Admits Homosexuality." Well Mr. JP 
thought this was in reference to him and complained. And to avoid conflict,
since I really don't feel like dealing with any of this shit, I just changed it. 

It is now a tale about a man named Mr. Anonymous Asshole. I think the message 
still comes through in the article though. Now anyways how is JP a hypocrite? 
Well first off, he writes all this freedom of speech shit on  antionline.com. 
Including an article about how the owner of micr0soft.com was getting threatend
by microsoft.com. And then what does he do? He turns around and throws a fit 
over an article that doesn't even use his name! Now, being a public figure, he 
is going to have to get used to being made fun of. And for those of you who 
are interested in the original article... well it's out there on different 
mirrored sites. Do a search for Enilnoitna and you will find it. 

Then we have all these people who dislike me because of my "Burn Kevin" page. 
Well they can all fuck themselves then! These people are the ones who think 
rights are so important and are bitchin about how Kevin had his rights taken 
away blah blah blah.. then they decide they can step on mine because of a 
difference of opinion? Now I will admit some were very courteous. But a lot
were  like "FUCK YOU BITCH" and shit like that. Just another example of how people 
accept freedom of speech only when it is convenient for them. Some people
even thought I should be sued over the page! 

What the fuck is up with people. I think anyone should be able to voice their 
opinion on something. Even people who I don't agree with. A lot of people 
have written shit about SIN and we don't give a fuck. Write all the shit you
want! It doesn't stop us from doing what we do. 

The point of this little rambling is... if we are gonna have freedom of speech
well then lets fucking have FREEDOM OF SPEECH! None of these people trying to
find bullshit ways to censor people they don't like or things said they don't
like. You can only have it one way or another.. and people need to realize 
that there are gonna be those who say things that they don't agree with. 
Deal with it... or move somewhere where you don't have those rights and can
be happy wearing a muzzle.
