Uranium 235

Uranium 235 is the Uranium metal used in an atomic bomb that uses
fission to explode. It is absolutely identical in its chemical compound
to U 238, which makes up most of the composition of Uranium metal.
Uranium is not only radioactive, it is the last naturally made element on
the periodic table of elements.


Uranium 238

Uranium 238 is what over 99% of Uranium metal is made up with. It
has the same exact chemical makeup as U 235, but U 238 is useless in a reaction
for an atomic fission bomb, but if it is placed in a nuclear reactor, over time it
will change into Plutonium 239, which can be used for a fusion bomb.
Uranium is not only radioactive, it is the last naturally made element on
the periodic table of elements.


Plutonium 239

Plutonium 239 is a man made element that is used in the fusion of an atomic
weapon. It is 2 elements 'up' from Uranium on the periodic table, and is more
stable than other man made elements, since it is so close in its makeup to
Uranium. Plutonium 239 can be made in particle accelerators, but it is more
commonly made by placing Uranium 238 inside of a nuclear reactor for an
unspecified time. ( This is secret NSA government stuff, thus I can not
report this, since I dont have a security clearance! ) . Over this time the
Uranium turns into Plutonium,  and is ready to be made into a nuclear weapon.


Fission

Fission is basically the splitting of an atom into 2 atoms, and thus producing
heat and energy as the atom is split. 


Fusion

Fusion is the fusing of two or more atoms together, thus producing heat and
energy as the atoms are united.


Chain Reaction

A chain reaction is when one reaction causes another, and that causes another,
and so on. This can be in order or  exponentually ( as is the case with an
atomic bomb. )


The Manhattan Project

The Manhattan project was a project started by President FDR and several
scientists in 1939, shortly before World War II, to test the viablity of
making atomic weapons. And as we can all see, they were successful. 
You will find out more about the Manhattan Project in a few minutes.


'Little Boy'

'Little Boy' was the name given to the Uranium fission bomb that was dropped
over Hiroshima on August 6th, 1945. It released 10 kilotons of an atomic
explosion ( the equivalent to 10,000 tons of dynamite ), however, this
was only 1/10th of 1 percent of its potential power. From the sucess of this
bomb, 'Fat Man' was then sent in by the US Government. This bomb was dropped
from the now infamous Enola Gay B-17 bomber.


'Fat Man'

'Fat Man' was the name given to the Plutonium bomb dropped over Nagasaki on
August 9th, 1945. This blast was also under 10 kilotons in force ( again,
using less than 1/10th of 1 percent of its potential power). Even though this
bomb was a mile and a half off of target, it still managed to level half of
Nagasaki.


Ground Zero

Ground Zero is the term used to describe where the bomb is dropped, and where
the explosion starts, since the blast zones flow out of ground zero.


Blast Zones

Blast Zones are a set of clearly defined rings of damage that center out
from ground zero. 



A Fission Nuclear Bomb:
-----------------------

Basically, the core is cut into 2 pieces.
The separate part is the 'bullet' projectile, which is shot into
the main core to start the chain reaction.


A Fusion Nuclear Bomb:
----------------------

Basically, the core is cut into 12 or more identical pieces
that MUST be the same exact size, and have the same exact 
weight and mass. These pieces are then compressed together, 
and they start off a chain reaction. This type of core is usually
in the shape of a soccer ball, and is very hard to produce.




The Basics of Bomb Detonation
-----------------------------
'How Bombs like 'Fat Man' are detonated'

There are 2 types of atomic explosions that can be facilitated by U-235;
fission and fusion. Fission, simply put, is a nuclear reaction in which an
atomic nucleus splits into fragments, usually two fragments of comparable mass,
with the evolution of approximately 100 million to several hundred million
volts of energy. This energy is expelled explosively and violently in the
atomic bomb. A fusion reaction is invariably started with a fission reaction,
but unlike the fission reaction, the fusion (Hydrogen) bomb derives its power
from the fusing of nuclei of various hydrogen isotopes in the formation of
helium nuclei. Being that the bomb in this project is strictly atomic, the
other aspects of the Hydrogen Bomb will not be discussed further.


The massive power behind the reaction in an atomic bomb arises from the forces
that hold the atom together. These forces are akin to, but not quite the same
as, magnetism.


Atoms are comprised of three sub-atomic particles. Protons and neutrons
cluster together to form the nucleus (central mass) of the atom while the
electrons orbit the nucleus much like planets around a sun. It is these
particles that determine the stability of the atom. 


Most natural elements have very stable atoms which are impossible to split
except by bombardment by particle accelerators. For all practical purposes,
the one true element whose atoms can be split comparatively easily is the
metal Uranium. Uranium's atoms are unusually large, henceforth, it is hard
for them to hold together firmly. This makes Uranium-235 an exceptional
candidate for nuclear fission.


Uranium is a heavy metal, heavier than gold, and not only does it have the
largest atoms of any natural element, the atoms that comprise Uranium have far
more neutrons than protons. This does not enhance their capacity to split, but
it does have an important bearing on their capacity to facilitate an
explosion.

There are two isotopes of Uranium. Natural Uranium consists mostly of isotope
U-238, which has 92 protons and 146 neutrons (92+146=238). Mixed with this
isotope, one will find a 0.6% accumulation of U-235, which has only 143
neutrons. This isotope, unlike U-238, has atoms that can be split, thus it is
termed "fissionable" and useful in making atomic bombs. Being that U-238 is
neutron-heavy, it reflects neutrons, rather than absorbing them like its
brother isotope, U-235. (U-238 serves no function in an atomic reaction, but
its properties provide an excellent shield for the U-235 in a constructed bomb
as a neutron reflector. This helps prevent an accidental chain reaction
between the larger U-235 mass and its 'bullet' counterpart within the bomb.
Also note that while U-238 cannot facilitate a chain-reaction, it can be
neutron-saturated to produce Plutonium (Pu-239). Plutonium is fissionable and
can be used in place of Uranium-235 (albeit, with a different model of
detonator) in an atomic bomb.)



Both isotopes of Uranium are naturally radioactive. Their bulky atoms
disintegrate over a period of time. Given enough time, (over 100,000 years or
more) Uranium will eventually lose so many particles that it will turn into
the metal lead. However, this process can be accelerated. This process is k
nown as the chain reaction. Instead of disintegrating slowly, the atoms are
forcibly split by neutrons forcing their way into the nucleus. A U-235 atom is
so unstable that a blow from a single neutron is enough to split it and
henceforth bring on a chain reaction. This can happen even when a critical
mass is present. When this chain reaction occurs, the Uranium atom splits into
two smaller atoms of different elements, such as Barium and Krypton. 


When a U-235 atom splits, it gives off energy in the form of heat and Gamma
radiation, which is the most powerful form of radioactivity and the most
lethal. When this reaction occurs, the split atom will also give off two or
three of its 'spare' neutrons, which are not needed to make either Barium or
Krypton. These spare neutrons fly out with sufficient force to split other
atoms they come in contact with. In theory, it is necessary to split only one
U-235 atom, and the neutrons from this will split other atoms, which will
split more...so on and so forth. This progression does not take place
arithmetically, but geometrically. All of this will happen within a millionth
of a second. ( as i said in the definitions, not in order ( arithmetically)
but exponentually ( geometrically ) So, thats why im taking Alegbra II G/T! )


The minimum amount to start a chain reaction as described above is known as
Super Critical Mass. The actual mass needed to facilitate this chain reaction
depends upon the purity of the material, but for pure U-235, it is 110 pounds
(50 kilograms), but no Uranium is never quite pure, so in reality more will be
needed.



Uranium is not the only material used for making atomic bombs. Another
material is the element Plutonium, in its isotope Pu-239. Plutonium is not
found naturally (except in minute traces) and is always made from Uranium. The
only way to produce Plutonium from Uranium is to process U-238 through a
nuclear reactor. After a period of time, the intense radioactivity causes the
metal to pick up extra particles, so that more and more of its atoms turn into
Plutonium.


Plutonium will not start a fast chain reaction by itself, but this difficulty
is overcome by having a neutron source, a highly radioactive material that
gives off neutrons faster than the Plutonium itself. In certain types of bombs,
a mixture of the elements Beryllium and Polonium is used to bring about this
reaction. Only a small piece is needed. The material is not fissionable in and
of itself, but merely acts as a catalyst to the greater reaction. 


To explode, the bomb must first be imploded, compressed to a subcritical
spherical fissionable mass (a ball of normal density uranium and other metals)
with specially designed explosives. Implosion is the detonation of explosives
on the outer surface, instead of the inner surface, which causes the
detonation/shock wave to move inward. The engineers working on bombs like
'Fat Man' or 'Little Boy' had to carefully design a smooth, symmetrical
implosion setup so that the shock waves would reach each part of the core at
the same time; a very difficult task. Once the shock wave is transmitted to
the fissionable core it compresses the core and raises the density to the
point of superciticality. This leads to a great explosion, which in the case
of 'Fat Man' is equivalent to 10,000 tons of TNT. Essentially, the fissionable
mass is crushed to a great density, and once the mass has reached that
supercritical density it goes "boom!"

Next, we will go on to find out how we now know how nuclear bombs work, thanks
to the Manhattan Project.



The Manhattan Project
---------------------

Shortly before the beginning of World War II, on August 2nd 1939, Albert
Einstein wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, about news that Einstein
and several other scientists had heard. They told Roosevelt of efforts in
Nazi Germany to purify U-235 with which might in turn be used to build an
atomic bomb. It was shortly thereafter that the United States Government began
the serious undertaking known only then as the Manhattan Project, to progress
the research and production of nuclear weapons, such as an atomic bomb. 


The first ( and most complicated ) issue to be addressed was the production of
ample amounts of 'enriched' uranium to sustain a chain reaction. At the time,
Uranium-235 was very hard to extract.


First off, Uranium ore must be converted to Uranium metal, which is a long
process, and which produces more waste then metal. ( The exact ratio is around
500:1, with 500 being waste ore, and one being usable Uranium metal ). Once
you have that Uranium metal, over 99% of that is Uranium-238 , which is
useless for an atomic bomb ( unless, that is you change it to Plutonium, which
I will get to later). To add on to that, Uranium-235 ( which is what is needed
to have a nuclear reaction) has the same exact chemical makeup as U-238. Many
of the Manhattan Project's scientists called this challence as hard as
'separating a solution of sucrose from a solution of glucose.' No ordinary
chemical extraction could separate the two isotopes. Only mechanical methods
could effectively separate U-235 from U-238. Howeve, several scientists at
Columbia University managed to solve this dilemma.


A massive enrichment laboratory and plant was constructed in Oak Ridge,
Tennessee. H.C. Urey, along with his associates and colleagues at Columbia
University, devised a system that worked on the principle of gaseous diffusion.
Following this process, Ernest O. Lawrence (inventor of the Cyclotron) at the
University of California in Berkeley implemented a process involving magnetic
separation of the two isotopes.


Following the first two processes, a gas centrifuge was used to further
separate the lighter U-235 from the heavier non-fissionable U-238 by their
mass. Once all of these procedures had been completed, all that needed to be
done was to put to the test the entire concept behind atomic fission. 


Over the course of six years, ranging from 1939 to 1945, more than 2 billion
dollars were spent on the Manhattan Project. ( However, from recent reports,
the real hidden costs of this project are just being seen, and that the real
cost is in the 100 Billions to Trillions of dollars.) The formulas for
refining Uranium and putting together a working bomb were created and seen to
their logical ends by some of the greatest minds of our time. Among these
people who unleashed the power of the atomic bomb was J. Robert Oppenheimer. 


Oppenheimer was the major force behind the Manhattan Project. He literally
ran the show and saw to it that all of the great minds working on this project
made their brainstorms work. He oversaw the entire project from its
conception to its completion.


Finally, it came time to test this new weapon ( 'The Gadget' as they called
it), to see if it was either the 2 billion dollar dud, of a new weapon, with
which we could end the war. This all came to a head on Jully 16th, 1945. On
that day, at 5:29:45 AM ( Mountain War Time), a test bomb was set off in the
hot basin of the Jemez Mountains in northern New Mexico. A white blaze filled
everything from the basin to the still dark skies. 'The Gadget' had rushed in
the Atomic Age. The explosion suddenly turned a fiery orange as the atomic
fireball shot up into the sky at 360 feet per second, changing red as it
cooled. The mushroom cloud that is so characterised in the movies, formed for
radioactive material, and materialized at 30,000 feet. Beneath the cloud, all
that remained of the soil was a huge hole in the sand, and radioactive shards
of green jade, which was caused by the super heating of the sand when the
bomb had gone off.
  

The brilliant light from the detonation pierced the early morning skies with
such intensity that residents from a faraway neighboring community would
swear that the sun came up twice that day. Even more astonishing is that a
blind girl saw the flash 120 miles away. 


Upon witnessing the explosion, reactions among the people who created it were
mixed. Isidor Rabi felt that the equilibrium in nature had been upset -- as if
humankind had become a threat to the world it inhabited. J. Robert Oppenheimer,
though ecstatic about the success of the project, quoted a remembered fragment
from Bhagavad Gita. "I am become Death," he said, "the destroyer of worlds."
Ken Bainbridge, the test director, told Oppenheimer, "Now we're all sons of
bitches."


Several participants, shortly after viewing the results, signed petitions
against loosing the monster they had created, but their protests fell on deaf
ears. The government was already planing Military targets. As it later turned
out, the Jornada del Muerto of New Mexico was not the last site on planet
Earth to experience an atomic explosion.


As many know, atomic bombs have been used only twice in warfare. The first and
foremost blast site of the atomic bomb is Hiroshima. A Uranium bomb (which
weighed in at over 4.5 tons) nicknamed "Little Boy" was dropped on Hiroshima
August 6th, 1945. The Aioi Bridge, one of 81 bridges connecting the
seven-branched delta of the Ota River, was the aiming point of the bomb.
Ground Zero was set at 1,980 feet. At 0815 hours, the bomb was dropped from
the Enola Gay. It missed its mark by only 800 feet ( Which, for military
strikes, especially in 1945, was great aim.). At 0816 hours, in the flash of
an instant, 66,000 people were killed and 69,000 people were injured by a 10
kiloton atomic explosion.


The point of total vaporization from the blast measured one half of a mile in
diameter. Total destruction ranged at one mile in diameter. Severe blast
damage carried as far as two miles in diameter. At two and a half miles,
everything flammable in the area burned. The remaining area of the blast zone
was riddled with serious blazes that stretched out to the final edge at a
little over three miles in diameter.


On August 9th 1945, Nagasaki fell to the same treatment as Hiroshima. Only
this time, a Plutonium bomb nicknamed "Fat Man" was dropped on the city. Even
though the "Fat Man" missed by over a mile and a half, it still leveled nearly
half the city. Nagasaki's population dropped in one split-second from 422,000
to 383,000. 39,000 were killed, over 25,000 were injured. That blast was less
than 10 kilotons as well. Estimates from physicists who have studied each
atomic explosion state that the bombs that were used had utilized only 1/10th
of 1 percent of their respective explosive capabilities.


While the mere explosion from an atomic bomb is deadly enough, its destructive
ability doesn't stop there. Atomic fallout creates another hazard as well. The
rain that follows any atomic detonation is laden with radioactive particles.
Many survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki blasts succumbed to radiation
poisoning due to this occurance. 


The atomic detonation also has the hidden lethal surprise of affecting the
future generations of those who live through it. Leukemia is among the
greatest of afflictions that are passed on to the offspring of survivors. 


The Detination Timeline of the 'Fat Man' Bomb
---------------------------------------------

The Fat Man bomb, which was dropped on Nagasaki, Japan the morning of August
8, 1945, went through the following steps as it reached ground zero ( the
point of detination ) :

   1.The bomb is dropped out of the plane at an altitude
      of 20,000 feet.

   2.Once the bomb reaches its detonation altitude
      (1,900 feet), otherwise known as ground zero, the
      altimeter sets off specially designed explosives.

   3.The explosives all detonate at the same time,
      causing the core of the bomb (uranium, plutonium,
      etc.) to implode. 

   4.As the core is imploding, its fissionable mass
      (material) becomes supercritical, at which point a
      fission chain reaction begins. 

   5.As the fission chain reaction continues, more and
      more energy is released by fission, and eventually
      the walls of the bomb disintegrate and the bomb
      explodes at full force. 


Blast Zones
-----------

 The blast zone is the area in which the bomb does the
 most damage. You can categorize the blast zone into five
 (circular) areas depending on their distance from the
 point of explosion and the power of the bomb. The chart
 below is the blast zone for the "Fat Man" bomb dropped
 on Nagasaki on August 8th, 1945. Fat Man unleashed
 just 10 kilotons of energy, which is equivalent to 10,000
 tons of TNT; nothing compared to the 10 megatons than
 can be released by a Hydrogen Bomb.
