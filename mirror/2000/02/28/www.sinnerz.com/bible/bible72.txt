Work Experience:

10/97 - 1/97
Employer: BoH26k (Brotherhood of Hacking 2600)
Activities: yo word, I have to give mad props to these guys, they got me where 
	    I am today. For this organization I did contract work with japan to 
	    execute remote penatration attacks on their servers (see 
            'www.custodian.closet.ppp32.port-32.takioawa.jp')

embarrassment.

Employer: Wal-Mart (Wall Mart)

            host or shelf. Also alerted head security staff of intrusion attempted 
            made by client operations.

           if "Tickle Me Elmo security" is not an essential part of Wal-Mart's 
           things they should teach in training class's. We will see who laughs last 
           on that topic!
