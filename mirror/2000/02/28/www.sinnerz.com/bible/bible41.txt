       Jonny Phreak's adventures in the Sticks - cZk - 11/29/97
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Ok, one day our hero Jonny Phreak, clad in his stolen bell south shirt, his 
stolen bell hardhat, and his also stolen utility belt with his coincidently 
stolen lineman's handset, was looking for a telco man hole when some real ugly 
bicth came up to him and was all "uNF uNF whatcha doin?" and Jonny Phreak was 
like "i'm sorry, i dont talk to ugly bitches" so the ugly bitch says "blah blah 
muh daddy will keel yew yew dirty jew" and so naturaly our friend Jonny Phreak 
replied and said "HEY you get your bitchass back in the kitchen and make me 
some pie#@~" and she ran off somewhere and Jonny continued his quest.

he looked for about 20 more minutes until he found a perfect manhole but alas, 
some bitchass frum the fone comapny was down there doing some kinda shit.  
Most phreaks whould be all like "0h nooooo i pheer authority%@#~" and run away 
while pissing themselves, but not Jonny Phreak, Jonny Phreak jumped down in 
the manhole and whipped out his "Official Telco Ninja" badge and told mr. fix 
it man to get the fuck out of the hole, the bell employee neglected to do as 
he was told.  Jonny Phreak told him to get the fuck out and to do his laundry 
before he busted out the j00-jits00 skeelz on the fat bastard and once again, 
the bell employee declined and that forced Jonny Phreak to pull out his strap, 
see Jonny Phreak NEVER goes field phreaking without his trusty 500,000 watt 
tazer in his pocket and his tear gas gernade (incase those bell fuckers call 
the police and Jonny needs to vamoose into the night undetected while the piggies 
choke on thier own saliva and tears) in his backpack.  So anyway, Jonny pulls 
out the stun gun and fries the shit out of the fat bell dude and hooks up to 
one of the modules.  1-800-MY-ANI-I-----POW#@~ that ugly bitch got her dad to 
kick Jonny's ass!  well, the one blow of the rifle stock nocked our hero unconcious 
and Bubba Ray (ugly bitch's dad) tied him to the back of the truck and drove 
home to deliverance alabama, (Bubba Ray was in town for a hunting convention) 
and upon his arival Jonny began to come to, when he did he was like  "what the 
fuck?" and ugly bitch, who was guarding him was like "uNF uNF i told yew asswipe, 
yew shoulda been nicer to me" and Jonny says "HEY why dont YOU go back to 
sanfransisco, with the REST of the jews#@~" and she took great offense and 
told him that he was fuct up the ass good now cause they stole his stun gun, 
and that they were gonna wait till all the family was there and tie some sticks 
to his head and close thier eyes and spin around a few times and then go 
deer-phreak hunting.  when he heard this he was getting pissed and he told 
her to slob his nob and to get away frum him and let him sleep, she complied 
with his request and went inside like the ugly bitch that she is.

Now of course our hero Jonny wasnt gonna go out like a deer at a drunken 
alabama family reunion so he thought all night about what to do and he came up 
with something purely genious, he knew when he was back home he had to brag like 
shit about this to all his maven friends.  Well, dawn came and so did the cousins... 
Jim Bob, Cletus, BobbyBoBob, Cousin Tyler, the twins, BillyBo, and Ma Coopanhagan.  
BubbaRay had everyone gather round the spitoon and he explained the situation 
to the best he could, what with his extensive vocabulary and all.  "well this 
here fella was-a talkin dirty to muh daughter the ugly bitch so i done nocked 
him out, an we're gonna hunt 'im fer sport then were gonna take the carcass, 
and eat it what with the 0-Day new fire place i done installed muh self out by 
where the old out house was, i done made i nice conver-cinver-convershun outta 
it, outhouse t' fire puttin place."  all the family agreed and Jonny asked them 
to untie him to make it more sportsman like and they said "hhheeeeeeelllll 
nnnnnnaaaaawwwww" so he told them if they untied him he would show them all how 
to count frum 10 to 20 so they figured they could all use some more book-lreanin 
and did as he asked, he told them he would give them all some beer and GPCs he 
had in his back pack so he reached in, and while his hand was in the backpack 
he pulled the pin out of the tear gas gernade and handed it to bubba ray and 
said, here's your beer, have fun" at this point Jonny TRUCKED into the woods 
leaving bubba ray trying to figure out how to open "that there can-a beer" for 
a few secounds until it went off, sending everyone to their knees.

When Jonny got far enuff into the woods he whipped out the trusty nokia and 
dialed up the vmb for all his brudders, 1-800-LIN-NOIS and he told them to gas 
up the fone-mobile and come pick him up.  thanx to aniII [a test edition] (the 
ONLY good use of it was this) he didnt need to tell them his location or 
anything, they would just break out the skeeelz and go to work.  Joe Mangor 
jumped into the hooptie (a stolen bell van) and drove down to deliverance and 
picked up Jonny Phreak and they lived happily ever after, and NONE of Jonny 
Phreak's associates ever left home without teergas gernades again.
