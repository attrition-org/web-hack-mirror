Okay. I'm sick of people (on IRC, usually) coming to me with statements like 
this:

"Why are you being so mean to me?!"
"Why do you think you're so much better than everyone else?!"
"What did I ever do to you?!"
"Where can I get pictures of naked men defecating on small animals?!"

	Well.. maybe the last one I don't hear so much. But you'd be 
surprised what kind of morons hangout on EFNET. Anyway.. back to my point. 
For those of you that don't know me, on IRC.. and well.. most other places.. 
I tend to be kind of "harsh" in conversing with the other people who happen 
to be around. Some might even say "insulting".. if you're the type of person 
that considers comments that completely degrade and humiliate someone else 
"insulting". But come now. No need to be so conservative. 
	This is my philosophy: if you act like an idiot, i will belittle you 
for it.  This may involve your consumption of fecal matter, but usually mocks 
the fact that you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. Now, is 
that so unreasonable? I thought not. But oddly enough, some people seem to be 
"offended" by these statements. Really.. I kid you not. Is the fact that your 
mother fucks your asshole with a rusty can opener that offensive? Is a random 
kick/ban really frustrating to you?  It's all in good fun guys! I want to be 
your friend. And by friend, I mean "person that picks on you relentlessly 
until your spirit breaks and you burst into tears." 
	But I digress. I did have a point at the beginning of this text. Yes, 
I am insulting you. I think you've figured that out. So why the fuck are you 
asking me WHY I'm doing it? Isn't it obvious? Are you the type of person that 
needs to have someone explain the psychology behind why the man is having sex 
with the woman in a porn flick? I think that question answers itself, 
actually. cough.
I'm insulting you basically because:
1) You are making a fool of yourself already, so I have this to work with.
2) I can get a reaction out of you and this entertains me. 
3) YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.
	Jesus Christ people. The last one disgusts me to no end. I don't know 
anyone I mock personally, and yet I manage to get them all riled up over 
something that doesn't matter. Is it because they're stupid? yes. Are they 
emotional unstable people? yes. Do they really have a secret sexual 
relationship with their cousins and pet poodles? possibly. In this crazy 
world of ours, who can say..
	In conclusion, I'm not being "mean" to you. You never "did" anything 
to me except happen to stumble upon someplace I'd rather not have you around, 
reducing the IQ average of the channel or wasting my oxygen. So hopefully, 
"friends", I'll see you around! And remember, if you get stuck, there's 
always the clever "i'm rubber, you're glue.." insult. That one always gets 
me!
