               Quit looking at me (One more reason People SUX!)

Why does it seem that everywhere I go people feel the need to stare? It never 
fails that every fucking time my boyfriend and I walk down the street here in 
the yuppie land of Bellevue, WA that people stare. Are people that uncultured
that they have never seen someone different then themselves? Whatthefuck? Could
it be that I have several tattoos, eyebrow ring, what I wear? Who knows and who
really cares. I don't give a fuck if you wanna look at me but quit staring.
Usually it's the yuppie middle aged (but trying to look 25) hair dyed as 
blonde as you can get it b4 it falls out BMW driving woman wearing the 
diamond ring that her sugar daddy bought her with her ugly ass poodle in 
the car veck. (I HATE that kinda person).

At first I tried to ignore it thinking, "Oh that person is just an fuckup."
But everywhere I go people seem to stare. Maybe just one or two people, but 
so what. I hate being looked at, stared at, judged. If I was that concerned how
I looked I'd enter a beauty contest or a freakshow. But I'm not. I get tattoos
for myself. I pierce for myself. If people think it's kewl, then right on. If 
not then fuck off. But quit staring. 

The best ways to stop the staring I have found have been:
1)Stare back (make sure to look em dead in the eye with a kinda 'Satan possessed'
look).
2)Stare at them with a fuct looking face.
3)Give em the Satan sign. (this actually is pretty kewl. I tried it on a lil 
kid at a restaurant and unfortunately for the parents the kid starting imitating  
me giving his parents the Satan horn sign. What did the parents do? Said "Oh 
look, he's making bull horns, oh geez how nice. Now son that's enuf". What a kewl kid.)
4)Stop when you notice your being stared at and get you and your friends to 
do some imitations of that person.
5)Flip em off, plain and simple beotch.

The people that tend to stare are uncultured vecks, wanna bs, preps (fucking dorks),
frat/sorority fucks (bigger dorks), baseball hat backwards wearing fags, people
ordering a 'non-fat, no foam, no whip, light syrup latte', etc..

Well to all of you I give a giant "EAT ME, FUCK OFF AND QUIT LOOKING AT ME"
