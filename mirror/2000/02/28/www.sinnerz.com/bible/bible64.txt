	I woke up one day to the lilting tune of my alarm clock - a blast of 
noise fine-tuned to make your teeth loosen, alternating with a period of 
silence just long enough to make you think it had stopped. After posing 
several questions to my empty room, like "What?" "Huh?" and "Unf?", I managed 
to turn the alarm clock off. I swung out of bed and sat there, my eyes gritty, 
blurry, and for the most part, closed. After a few peaceful moments of 
introspection, trying to justify staying home, and grunting, I decided to 
try and get up and eat breakfast. I staggered to the door like a drunk on a 
merry-go-round, and flipped on the light. I stood there, squinting, swaying, 
and grunting softly to myself for a while, when I opened the door and 
staggered into the dining room. I turned on that light, and went into the 
kitchen to grab my breakfast equipment: one (1) large bowl, one (1) big 
spoon, one (1) gallon of 1% milk, and one (1) box of cereal (Cinnamon Toast 
Crunch). I made my way back into the dining room and arranged my gear: bowl 
in center, spoon directly to the right, milk to the far left, cereal to the 
far right. I poured myself some cereal and milk, and scooped up a big spoonful. 
Between bites, I heard the car start up across the street. As my second 
spoonful of cereal made its ponderous yet steady way up to my mouth, I heard 
something scream. Not an operatic "the murderer is in the house" scream, but 
a real scream of pain. I froze. My thoughts zipped over to the cute little 
black puppy the people with the car owned. I heard a car door open and a 
woman yell "Oh my god, you killed him!" and start crying. Another car door 
opened, and a man said "Well Jesus Christ, I didn't mean to!" "Oh god, what 
are going to do with him?" the woman sobbed. "Just get back into the car, 
honey, I'll take care of it." The woman sobbed something in assent, and got 
back in the car. The man cussed for a while, and I heard the lid being taken 
off of a metal trash can. Clang. Something heavy fell into the trash can. 
Thump. The lid got put back on. Clang. The man got back into the car, trying 
to comfort the woman, and they drove away. I sat there, spoon frozen in its 
trajectory, and mulled over the previous five minutes. I looked at the spoon, 
and after a slight pause, let it fall back into the bowl, where it landed 
with a wet splat. I got up, put the cereal back in the cupboard, the milk in 
the 'fridge, and walked over to the sink, bowl in hand. I poured the cereal 
out into the sink, creating an ever-thinning universe of whiteness, 
punctuated only by the occasional chunk of cereal. I left the bowl in the sink.
