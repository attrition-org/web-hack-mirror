	He sat in the seat, dressed in the plastic yellow suit. His earmuffs 
cutt out most of the sound of the helicopter wings beating above. This drop
was to figure out what was affecting a small village, a disease. As the pilot
waved the signal to jump, he took a deep breath, dawned his helmet, and 
jumped from the helicopter. His parachute spread, floating him towards the
ground. He was landing in a great area, right next to the village. He landed 
with a loud crash, and a puff of african soil burst into the air. He wiped 
himself off, and walked towards the village. The people were bustling about,
and greeted him as he walked around. The children followed him, curious about
his suit and his parachute. He reached the meeting hut, where the chief was.
He entered, and spoke to the chief, the fat, greasy haired chief. "Hello, I'm
 Dr. Honus from the CDC, may I ask you a few questions?" The chief opened his
 eyes. "Hi, yes you may." 
"Does this disease kill it's victims?"
"Yes."
"Have you named it anything yet?"
"The Brown Plague."
"Hmm. Interesting. What are the effects of it?"
"It really varies from person to person."
"No common effects?"
"Well, no, but it is a sexually transmitted disease."
"Strange... what exactly does it do...?"
	The chief closed his eyes. He smiled a crooked, rotten toothed grin,
and began to laugh. "What's so funny?" asked Honus. "Oh, not much... there
is one thing though, only white people may catch this disease." "What on earth?
A racist disease?" asked Honus. "Of sorts..." the chief jumped upon his table
, and screamed at Honus, "In other words, have you heard of what we do to 
strangers around here? Who disrupt our daily lives?" Honus began to get 
afraid. "No, no what do you do?" The chief looked into his hands. "Soon
 friend, soon. You will learn the ways of the blessed." Honus looked at him
 strangely. The chief raised his stick above his head, and smashed Honus in
 the temple with it. Honus dropped to the floor.
	Honus came to. He had no suit on. He had no clothes on. He was tied 
up in broad daylight, naked, in front of a crowd of africans, looking on 
angrily at him. Honus got embarrassed, because his penis had yellow puss 
filled warts on it. This was overcome soon, however, for he was more afraid
 of what was going to happen. The africans had something in store for him.
 The first man walked up to him, and grinned. "This will be long but 
pleasurable, i love visitors." He smiled again. He tore the rags from his own
 hips violently and yelled, "Visitors, we love, yes!?" The crowd behind him 
roared. He laid next to Honus, and said, "Relax, my visitor... we wish not to
 hurt you..." He leaned into Honus' torso, and inserted his penis into his 
asshole. "Now, my american friend, let us pray." The man fucked him, and 
fucked him, and Honus wondered if he would ever stop. His colon was getting 
sore, and internal blood was spilling onto the dirt. As he finished, he 
smiled, and wiped the sweat from his forehead. Honus was glad it was over 
with. The african man said, "The fun is only beginning friend, the ritual has
 but begun!" Honus looked at the smiling crowd of african men in fear, and 
they formed a line. It was going to be a long time to live.
