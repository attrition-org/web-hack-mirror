Today I sat down on my couch, and popped in a movie that I had rented 
earlyier that day. It was a movie that was recommended to me by several people 
who claimed "this is the best movie ever made". It was a cartoon by the name 
of "Ghost in the shell". Oops did I say cartoon? Oh I'm sorry I meant 'Anime'. 
This is some new breakthrough, adult type of cartoons that are imported from 
the same country's that brought us "Godzilla", "Ultraman", and many other 
puppet type bad movies. 

As I pressed the play button on my VCR, fast fowarded through the previews, 
and sat through the FBI warning, I thought I was up against the usual banter 
that a cartoon usually brings. You know the anvils, the large hammers and 
some non-depictive gore. Alas the starting credits prooved this theory wrong. 
The opening scene draws you, through a city skyline to a nipple'less naked 
woman on top of a large building. Was this supposed to be some kind of 
whacked out male fantasy? The froidian "revert to childhood" fantasys? As a 
male, I had  no attraction to this scantilly clad female cartoon, It was 
hard for me to get the visions of little oriental guys sitting around a 
drawing table asking eachother questions like "should we make her boobies 
bigger huhuh?" out of my mind.

As the movie went on, I kept on reasurring myself that there would be some 
kind of understandable plot along the way somewhere. Some kind of key that 
would release the whole story line, and bring it all together so a normal
human being could understand what was going on. Did this ever happen? No. 
With pointless slow motion camera like action sequences and meaningless 
talk/rant scenes, this movie went downhill, and never reverted to giving 
me even a slight fucking hint on what was going on. 

Mabye I did understand the plot, and was thinking that the story line was 
much more complex then it really was. Mabye all there was to it was some 
guy who "hacks" into other peoples minds (becuase by the year two thousand 
and somthing we are of course, mindless robots) and takes controll over 
them to do his dirty work (killing off world leaders, terrorism and such) 
while there are still a few people who are not robots, these people are 
used to help the police becuase "they have feelings". But still, if this 
was the plot, you didnt need any of that useless long talking scenes, 
this movie could have been done, produced, and on the shelves in a half 
hour, not the 2 hours that it took.

But still the ending was abrubted, and left me thinking "what the hell 
just happened?". I had a vision of my 4 dollars that I spent renting 
this movie with little wings flying away. I really find it annoying when 
I leave a theater, my couch or anything of that sort that includes a 
screen, and I dont understand a GODDAMNED thing that went on..Its one 
thing when you leave a live action flick and dont understand it, its 
another thing when you leave a fucking cartoon and dont understand it.

I guess I am just used to the type of cartoons where the mouse beats 
the shit out of the cat, the bird gets the last laugh, the coyotee 
always falls off the cliff, the type of cartoon that you can come 
home from a hard days work, school or what have you be, and totally 
let your brain take the last train to space. To be honest I dont
want to even begin to think when im watching tv.

Why should anyone feel as if their audience should have a brain to watch 
their mindless movies anyway? Intelligence should never be a factor that 
comes into play when your watching tv, hence the long used term "the 
boob tube". America wants charicters that are dumber then they are, 
they want shows about bums, they want jerry louis, they want the 
three stooges, they want the brady bunch, friends, judge judy, 
jerry springer, and the simpsons!

GIVE US LIFE, GIVE US IGNORANCE, GIVE US MINDLESS VIEWING PLEASURE, 
		    FOR I AM WATCHING TV!
