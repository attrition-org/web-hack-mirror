Beige Boxing fun!
-----------------


Just thought i would write a txt for the Holy Bible since i havent done so 
already. this is about a cool thing that happpened only a few nights ago.
it involved me and my firend and a cool little phreaking device known as a 
beige box. here is an account of the story as well as i remember it! 
(names edited out)

9:00pm - [Avatar] arrives at my house. late as usual. he was supposed to be 
	 here at 7:00. he informs me that he brought the stanley knife and
	 the toolkit. 

9:30pm - My printer is fixed. we decide to login and see whats happenin on
	 the net.logged on to IRC and talked to some friends for a little
	 while. long while.

10:30pm - [Avatar] checks in my room to see that i have been taking good 
	  care of our beige box. We discuss plans for the night.

10:45pm - My father arrives home from wherever the hell he went.

11:00pm - Me and [Avatar] talk about how the fone system works. He explains
	  to me why our black box doesnt work by showing what old anologue
	  exchanges were like compared to new digital ones.

11:30pm - Enlightenment is achieved. I do not have a good knowledge of
	  electronics which is part of the problem. so he explains some to
	  me and we talk about wave forms n shit.

12:00am - coast is clear. we sneak out of the house. we walk down the road
	  to the can thats lid isnt locked down. cant get it off.

12:15am - We realise that we have forgotten to bring some fone numbers with
	  us. I run back and sneak back in and get them.

12:30am - My dog escapes. i sneak back in and lock her up. We then go 
	  wandering around looking for pits.

1:30am - We finally find a good pit. But we lost the fuckn numbers again!!
	 i run back and sneak in and get them again.

1:45am - We lift the pit lid with our metal lifters. [Avatar] then gets out
	 his stanley knife and strips the wire coating carefully.
	 [Avatar] manages to strip the coating with all the wires still
	 intact. we then attach the alligator clips.

2:00am - We have a dialtone! we quickly dial the number that tells us
	 where we are dialing from. now we are ready for fun ;)

2:10am - We quickly decide on who to ring. we dial the long number.
	 it rings. a deep voice answers. It is |Banshee| heheh, now
	 was he shocked or what???? :)
	 Me and [Avatar] have a brief word with [|Banshee|] to see how
	 hes goin n stuff. the brief word lasts about one and a half
	 hours heheheheheheheehheheheh. From this converation i learnt:
	 hes really cool (already knew that)
	 he doesnt have to do jack shit till september!!!
	 hes finding linux easy.
	 Americans use Faranheit, and inches and feet.
	 He learnt:
	 Australains dont wear alligator skin suits.
	 There are cops in Australia.
	 We use the metric system.
	 Crocodiles dont roam the streets.
	 I dont personally know crocodile dundee.

4:00am - We go and get some food from the local service station and discuss
	 our success.

4:??am - We get home... end of story.


For those who read this and arent into phreaking, i really urge you to 
learn about it. its _REAL_ cool! this was not our first phreaking
experince but definitely the best one! ;)
