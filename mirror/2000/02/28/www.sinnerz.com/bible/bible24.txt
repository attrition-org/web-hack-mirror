Title: The CodeZero 0wNz m3y3 d0G
By: The Messiah


I was wandering around the web one day, when I saw a link to CodeZero's web 
page (http://www.codez.com). Apparently, they 0wN SIN. News to me. Anyway, 
here's my rebuttal of the page... hehehe. Quotes from the page are in bullshit 
tags. It's just so easy...

<bullshit>
sIn are a lame fuck wannabe w1nd0ze k0ding group, they can't hack, they rip 
all the shit they release, and they are all in other wannabe groups on the 
UnderNet. Three Months ago we had nothing on any of their members, since then 
we have been slowly assimilating more information, and we have built the 
inf0z templates below, sIn are 0wned.
</bullshit>

Messiah sez: y0y0y0. You can tell they're l33t0 by the w4y th3y t4lk... As 
for ripping shit, yahahaha- prove it. Where o where can I find the source 
code for OTP-Pack? Mmmm? Eh? On my hard drive? Dizamn. Also, why can't anyone 
spell SIN right? It's not sIn, nor SiN, nor sIN, nor siN, nor SIn, and not 
even Sin. 'Tis an acronym, therefore, it's all in caps. Not hard to do, guys. 
To top it off, you guys seem to have a problem distinguishing plural from 
singular. SIN is a group, therefore it is singular. Only one SIN. You don't 
say "the group are ready" unless you flunked out of third grade. If you want 
to say that you 0wN us, simply say this: "SIN iZ 0wN3d." Grammar, while 
appearing difficult, is actually quite simple. Also, you shouldn't say 
"The CodeZero 0wNz j00." For one, "the" is unnecessary, and adds to the 
confusion. Again, "CodeZero"  is singular, because it is referring to the 
group itself. CodeZero *is* un-stoppable, not "are".

<bullshit>
     The sIn member list is...

     Fucking Hostile     - Nealry 0wned 
     The Banshee         - Nearly 0wned 
     The Messiah
     SandWorm            - Quit sIn 
     Evil Chick          - 0wned 
     \\StOrM\\           - 0wned 
     Darkfool 
     Dustin Ashe         - Never seen him 
     Soul Tear           - Never seen him 
     Majestic Cockster   - Never seen him 
     Lord Duke           - Never seen him 
     JDKane              - 0wned 
     Blue Buddah 
     JeNnYGrL            - 0wned
</bullshit>

Um... just curious, but when did JDKane and Jen get to be in SIN? They're just 
people who hang out in #sin, and know a lot of people in SIN. Nada mas. Also, 
I like the blank spot by my name.

</bullshit>

You know, for someone who can only program in VB, he plays a remarkably good 
C programmer. Also, Port Pro and Port Nuke have been out for quite some time 
now, *before you guys released your version of them*. So *who* rips code? 
BTW, Storm's "inf0z" is on his source code, which he gives out. Wow. l33t0

Wow! You found out his first name (which he tells to everyone), the city he

Uh.... if you were to ask him his name and state on IRC or something, he'd 
tell you. This is not really info, because there's around 500,000 people 
named Mark who live in Maryland. Not too impressive...
