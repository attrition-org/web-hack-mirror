The hacking "scene" as many would call it is offically dead. No, I take that
back... it has been dead. Actually it has just changed into such a state of 
utter stupidity that the term "hacker" should be looked upon with ridicule, 
not respect. I would like to give a big FUCK YOU too all the so-called hackers 
out there. You people are shit. And I am not talking about newbies or any
of that shit. They just don't have a clue, but I'm willing to bet they turn
out like most of you idiots out there. The newbies that come around now look
up to these self-proclaimed hackers who download the latest exploits and then
attempt to hack server after server so they can leave their mark and let the
world know they '0wned' some webpage. 

When will people learn that webpage hacking takes no talent? I am saying
this to all of the people who have mirrors of their hacks on hacked.net. You 
people eat cock. I don't give a fuck who doesn't like me for this or who
disagrees with me. I am stating the facts.. the full motherfucking truth that
no one else wants to see. Hyprocrites flood the scene today. They want to
see their faces on the news, to get interviews, to be known to everyone as
elite. Elite shouldn't even be used to describe the current state of the
hacking scene. The only people out there I respect are those who write and
publish Phrack magazine.. and of course a few others whose knowledge I saw
for the little time that I was on the DC-Stuff mailing list. They have way
more knowledge then these fools who go around hacking webpages. I am so 
tempted to just start listing names of these people and/or groups, but I 
am sure they know who they are.

They complain about security. Security of any system can always be improved.
I am sure that whatever OS these 'vanity hackers' (I will call them that 
from now on) use is not 100% secure. But they feel the need to go hack a 
webpage, put their name/group all over it and call the admin an idiot. These
people have a lot to learn. They look at all the exploits on rootshell.com 
and they think the DoS attacks are for them to use on IRC. They see the new
exploits that come out as ways for them to hack more webpages. The people who
code the exploits found on rootshell.com make them so people can fix the 
problems, not provoke them.

There are very many hypocrites and a lot of them show that they are pretty
uneducated. You see the vanity hackers making statements like "Yeah there
are a lot of newbies and lamers out there, most are young kids blah blah.."
See, this is retarded because most of the vanity hackers out there are under
18. They are kids just wanting attention. They are wanting to be looked up
to, and the sad truth is that the newbies do look up to them because they see
the vanity hackers' names all over the place. A new trend I have seen is that 
the webpage hackers are trying to make a statement on their hacks instead of 
just putting 'you are 0wned ph33r'. The problem is they are trying to say that 
the media lies when it calls hackers malicious. "We are just trying to 
increase the spread of information" and bullshit like that. Fools. Now does a bank
robber rob a bank and say "HEY, I'M NOT WRONG? I AM JUST DOING THIS SO MY
VOICE IS HEARD." Face the facts fools. They are breaking the law and trying
to say that they are't wrong. "Hi I am going to deface a webpage and say that
hackers aren't bad." I am sure there are a lot of admins that see that shit
and think "WOW THANKS A LOT FOR HACKING OUR WEBPAGE.. I understand you are
just trying to help!" Someone needs to fucking smack these idiots with a bat.

People often mistake SIN and think that we are a hacking group. No, we are not.
I take that as an insult. I would say we are just a group of friends and
computer enthusiasts. Many members have interest in computer security, data
security, and programming. We all are interested in the advancing technology
of computers. Most people I would say dislike us because we aren't like other
people. People don't like things that are different. We do things are way, No
one cares what other people think as far as actions go. I know a lot of 
people won't like me just because I wrote this article. Well, in the words of
Jonathan Davis...
