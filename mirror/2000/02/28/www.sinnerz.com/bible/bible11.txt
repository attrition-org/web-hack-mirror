                     -Conclusions On Religious Fruads-

Today started off pretty shitty. It was shitty because i had to go to church.
I first off do not believe in god nor the devil. I am an athiest. When it 
comes to my views on the christian relegion i think most christians are
weak and just looking for a reason for thier own existance. I too question
why are we hear and how did we get here, but i don't beleive it was a god
that got us here. There is absolutly no reason to believe in a god. People
say the bible tells it all but if they read close enough it contradicts itself
in many situations. First off.. the bible says in the 10 commandments.. "thou
shalt not have any other god before me" or some shit like that. Well i noticed
today that christians have made jesus out to be a god. You go to church and
they tell you to worship jesus. You are only supposed to worship one god tho.
So what is a christians comment to this? They say that god and jesus are one
in the same. Now this is also a contradiction of other shit in the bible then.
The old testament said an eye for and eye. So if one man poked out your eye
you were to poke out his eye. Then along comes the new testament.. all of a
sudden god is a forgiving god. Why? Because jesus died for our sins supposidly.
Now if it was jesus that changed gods ideas then jesus was not really one in
the same with god... and if he was one in the same with god then why would god
have changed from vengeful to forgiving? And he is also "all knowing" so he knew
the future so what would be the point of being venegeful for a while then
changing? I could go on and on with more points to ponder on why i think the
bible and god are both false but im tired so im not going to. But im saying
think about what i've said.. and look a lil closer at some of the shit said 
in the bible. Don't just give in to something because its what you were told
was the right thing ya know? Anyways tis all for me. laterz.
