                         The Wonderful World of Shit


Alright I have so much to type so I am not sure where to start. This will
all get mixed up and shit probably. I just have been reading a lot of magazines
lately... music ones. I was away for 2 weeks in Orlando and New Orleans on
vacation, and me and this dude I was with picked up a couple music zines...
RIP, Livewire, and Circus (Circus sux but it had a big article on Korn!). So
Anyways I noticed as I read a lot of the letters people sent in that there
is a lot of stupid fucking idiots out there.

First I wanna start with these people who write in and bitch about someone 
else bitching about a band they like. You see people who write in and say shit
like "Kurt Cobain had so much talent" or "Marilyn Manson is such an influence".
WHAT THE FUCK IS UP WITH THAT SHIT?!?!?!?!

Ok I know there are a lot of Nirvana fans out there. Of which 90% didn't know
who Nirvana was until Kurt KABANG decided to blow his fucking head off. They
were all too busy listening too MC Hammer and Kris Kross when Nirvana started
out. Anyways... these dorks who worship Kurt write in and put shit about how
much talent he had and stuff like that. They are full of shit. I play guitar
and I have respect for musicians with talent even if I don't like the music.
Kurt played power chords mostly. He did simple shit. It takes me no time to
figure out a Nirvana song. ANYONE CAN PLAY THAT SHIT. And it's not like it 
took any talent to come up with either. He uses the most common chords that 
you hear in songs. Same with Bush, Marilyn Manson, and almost every alternative
band out thier. YES I am labeling alternative music as having NO TALENT. Am
I saying it sucks? NO. I like to listen to Nirvana occasionally.. even Marilyn
Manson.. but do these people have talent? Not hardly. Manson has more then
Nirvana tho cuz he knows how to put on a show that gets him attention. He is
a self-proclaimed fake... but I will go in to that later. The point of this
is PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT MUSIC SHOULDN'T COMMENT THAT SOMEONE IS
THE GOD OF GUITAR OR ANYTHING ELSE!!! Fuck that. You want a good guitarist 
check out Steve Vai or Dimebag Darrel.. those people are influences. Hendrix
is an influence. I play heavy music but blues is an influence to my playing.
Nirvana is not a talented band. As a band they have very little musical talent.
I can go way more into this but I have said my point... you stupid lil fuck ups
out there need to learn to not talk like you know whats up when you don't have
a clue.

Next.. in another article I read someone said how Nirvana influenced all rock
today. WHAT THE FUCK!?!?!??!?!!?!?! Are these people all on acid? They are fools.
The *ONLY* influence Nirvana had was getting a bunch of posers to try and rip
off his style of whining and writing stupid lyrics to get famous. And what happens?
IT WORKED! Yes.. all these alternative bands pop up who used to be butt rockers.
Nirvana as I said hasn't influenced anyone musically. Accept to change thier 
style. The comment I read said "Bush has a lot of talent.. Kurt influenced him".
WTF.. there it is again.. that word talent... BUSH DONT HAVE TALENT U ANAL
FUZZ BALL!!! And influenced by Nirvana? Bush doesn't sound anything like Nirvana.
I think Bush sucks shit.. but they don't sound like Nirvana. A lot of people
in rock music look down at Kurt for starting a shitty trend. Hell man... next
thing you know Garth Brooks will stick dynamite in his ass and blow himself up
and hicks will be running around all over the place. Now that would be hell on
earth.

Ok lets see.. what now? Now I wanna talk about these fucking Marilyn Manson 
dorks. Are they fools? They worship him.. WHY? He has said himself he laughs
at all the people who take him serious. No one out there has a clue what manson
is all about. Manson doesn't even know. He knows he has an image that gets him
money and attention. So anyways what do all his 12-14 year old followers say?
"Oh he teaches you to be yourself and not what's in". I am sure that is what
Manson tried too do. BUT WHAT HAPPEND? All these kids now dress like Marilyn
Manson and listen to his music only and would do what ever Manson says. These
people aren't themselves.. THEY ARE MANSON. Or are trying to be... they aren't
individuals... the fucking grocery store clerks are more individuals then those
lame fucks. I guess that says it all there...

Alright now then I wanna bitch about sell-outs. All these people who complain
about shit like 'oh Pantera is charging more for there concerts.. they have 
sold out they suck'. Ok that is not selling out.. that is wanting money.. if
i was in his place i would want the cash too man. Playing music is fun.. but
being able to pay for things is cool also. And then there are people that are
like 'oh this band is too trendy.. they suck now' WTF.. you are supposed to
like a band for the music not for what others think about them. I would like
it if Limp Bizkit was played on MTV a lot and i could see more of them. Of
course then people would say they sold out! How tho? I just don't see it. Real
sell outs are Metallica and Marilyn Manson. Metallica sold out musically. They
changed thier whole style to sell records. I think they were scared. They saw
how bands like Skid Row and Megadeth weren't doing so great when they released
new albums.. so Metallica sold out. And it worked.. they got thier cash and
all the trendys jumped right on them. Marilyn Manson didn't sell out musically.
Thier music style and lyrics are still the same. But they changed thier image
for attention.. this pissed me off. They decided to dress up like fags to draw
a crowd of shocked people. I don't see why. I'm not shocked. It's just some dude
trying to make a name for himself. 

Well fuck i forgot what else i wanted to bitch about.. but if it comes up i 
will write another article.... so for all of you lame ass posers who wanna
flame me.. go right on ahead...
