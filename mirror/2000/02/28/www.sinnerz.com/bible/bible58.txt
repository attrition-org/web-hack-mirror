	2am and I'm sitting at Denny's (the stereotypical 2 oclock in the 
morning restaurant. I've been there recently, now they're turning it into 
some cheesy market trap for old people, they're trying to renovate it and 
create a new "image"), looking over a cup of water-bled coffee as a group 
of people huddle around, chit-chatting through smoky veil of my cigarette. 
I don't try to hide my disinterest. One girl, 17 or so, has makeup smeared 
across her face; she's pregnant. Another guy is 22 or so; he lives in a dirty 
apartment feeding on drugs and his own lethargy. 
	A couple of nights ago I saw a man jump off a bridge. It was a slow 
shutter camera scene.. driving over the newly built high rise, a woman and a 
man in the shadow near the railing. My friend asks me, "was that man on the 
other side of the railing?" I didn't know. We get to the other side, turn 
around, and drive by again, this time.. slowly. The man lets go, and the 
woman puts her face into her hands. I apathetically think, "fuck. let's get 
out of here." We leave.
	In the news, a kid shoots down his fellow classmates in his own 
school cafeteria. He kills his parents. 
 	I come home, and I turn on the computer. Logging on and the boredom 
fills me instantly, completely.. compounding indifference and something else. 
It's amazing how arrogant I can be.. access to information on a million 
computers and I'm still fucking bored. 
	Whenever I'm around a group of people I don't know, I'm prone to 
saying nothing. I just sit there, observe, and see what these people are all 
about. I sit back silently and smirk; I let the drama play itself out. 
Sometimes people ask me why I don't say anything. Am I shy? A little, but 
that's not usually the reason. I can voice my opinion when need be. Silence 
is easy, it's intimidating. I'm silent because of the things I've seen and 
the things I've experienced. I'm silent because there are a million people 
out there being oppressed, there are girls being raped, there are rednecks 
hollering about how we need guns for protection when it's been proven that 
gun control reduces crime. I'm silent for everyone out there who gives a 
fuck, who's sick about talking about nothing and is ready to get down to 
something. There's no need to bitch and whine about petty mishaps to people 
who don't really care, but there is a need to shout out what you have to say 
when you have a point to make. 
	We're a nameless generation so far, the kids born in the 80's, no 
longer generation X, marketing has tried to place upon some other ridiculous 
labels: generation Y, generation next, etc. We are being hounded with slogans 
like "image is everything" and we wonder why girls starve themselves to death 
to look pretty. 
	Well, fuck slogans. I'm not going to open my mouth to perpetuate 
them, perpetuating lies and stupidity. so don't ask me why I'm not saying 
anything when you talk about your barbie-doll lives and your plastic families. 
We're a generation that has witnessed violence, committed violence, and 
offered no real explanation for it. This has united and divided us. Older 
people have looked upon us in suspicion; it seems like our country is 
destined for a return to "family values" (via the Christian Coaltion) because 
we know only extremes.
	It's time to give a fuck.. it's time to wake up from apathy. My dream 
is a literary revolution- and we CAN invoke it in this new electronic media. 
This is how we can be heard.. this is how we can carry it into our politics 
and our way of life. We're intelligent and we value our freedom, and we 
shouldn't let any assholes (whether they be religious or political) take it 
from us.
	Anyway, I think I've rambled enough for this evening. All I want, all 
I hope is to get someone out there to be shaken from his jello padded world 
and THINK. Thank you.
