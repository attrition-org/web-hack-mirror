A good friend of mine is a Christian (Methodist) and not very friendly with 
our good ol' Mr. Manson and his little musical group. Me, being 
insensitive, started singing some of the lyrics from one of the bands songs 
which went something like "You will grow, you will grow, you will grow to 
hate me.". She, my friend, enquired whose lyrics they were, I told her. She 
just said "I already hate him.".
	"Judge not, that ye be not judged." Matthew 7:1
	"...and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith,
	love, patience, meekness." Timothy 6:11

I really have a problem with the mentality of most human beings. What 
brought this on? Watching TV, something about the Columbine Massacre, two 
girls after almost being killed start giving an interview for TV. This was 
just after they'd come out of the school. I don't quite understand that, I 
really don't. Maybe that was their 15 minutes of fame, maybe you have to 
take what you can get, crisis and opportunity are covered by the same word 
in Chinese (According to Lisa Simpson).

Small irony, "Columbine High School, Home of the Rebels". The rebels there 
is referring to some people from the American Civil War. When the 
rebel  rears its head it becomes the enemy. No matter how much they don't 
like it once they are in power they no longer like the rebels, they may 
admire the spirit, and believe they still have it but those in power can 
not be rebels.
	Rebelion is inversely proportional to power.

Lets all go find someone to blame!! Placing blame on others shifts it from 
ourselves and therefore clears our conscience. We desire a clean conscience 
(Maybe supposed altruism is just a way to clear consciences), more than 
many more thing, it is just perhaps you don't know you do. Consumerism a 
wonderful way to clear a conscience. The replenishment of "stuff", old for 
new, blotting out the past by removing the reminders it actually happened. 
The entire consumerist society maybe geared to purification of tainted lives.

Good argument for guns... you can defend what is yours.
Good argument against guns... you can take what isn't yours. Two sides to 
every story.

A guy at college (A nice guy, maybe he empathizes too much? Has pretensions 
to be a great actor) said something about the death of Quentin Crisp, how 
"It was a shame.". No it wasn't a shame, in his last interviews, in fact I 
think for a long while, he showed his desire for the embrace of death. That 
is not something bad, possibly the opposite. What is a shame is that he is 
no longer there for your enjoyment, maybe even you think it is a shame the 
dead can no longer have your company. Mourning is a selfish act. ANOTHER 
RETURN TO A PREVIOUS THEME. No altruism, only egotism.

V

Terrorism. I think I'll sue. When was the last time you felt terror due to 
terrorists or terrorism? Dare I say, unless you are particularly unlucky or 
sensitive, you have never been kept awake at night in a cold sweat 
stiffened by the terror of the terrorist campaign. Modern terrorists seem 
to be very short sighted, a bomb one week in a city centre never leaves 
every city centre empty the next. People forget, outrage subsides and 
routine takes over. Never terror, never. I think it is more the fault of 
television news, it is sanitised and cleaned. No blood, limbs or other 
bodily fluid excreted in moments of absolute terror. Then again, how much 
blood can be shown when it is covered in rubble? Bombs destroy too many 
buildings, the headlines can read damage in money not dead. Do not destroy 
the material, destroy the flesh. Use guns that rip apart flesh, SMALL nail 
bombs to impale peoples trunk and extremities and bladed weapons to hack 
away at the remains. We need children covered in the blood of their 
parents, old married couples still holding hands intestines on the floor. 
We need it in shopping centres, in houses, in offices and in playgrounds, 
it has to be on TV, uncut and we need it often. We need people so terrified 
in the knowledge that anywhere, anytime they could be the next victim that 
they become little more than shells of people, jumping at the slightest 
noise and fearing the next breath they take could be their last. We need 
terrorism!
