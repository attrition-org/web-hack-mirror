After much organisation and promise, seccon finally took place on the
16th and 17th of July. For those of you unfamiliar with seccon, it 
is a security conference that was held in Sydney, Australia - the 
first of it's kind. It was unlike defcon and some of the other 
conferences though, in that it was quite a formal occasian and many
corporate people were there (more of them than us :P).

The first day mainly centred on Windows NT Security. After 
introductions and a run down on laws regarding computer crime from 
a Federal Police Member, the subject matter was NT weaknesses. 
The first talk was actually given by ph1sh, who we all know from irc :)
He basically discussed some of the weaknesses that were being exploited 
by people around the web. I helped write this speech. Then another guy 
who was from MS was talking about how secure NT5 sould be. There was a 
break at this point and i got talking to ph1sh and all that.

The discussion then moved to virii. I was going to leave for this 
but i stayed and listened to a speech by a dude called 'Quantum'. It was 
really interesting surprisingly as he detailed problems with getting virii 
to go resident and sofourth. There were a few other talks by corporate 
people as well. I had to leave early on the first day so i didn't get to 
hear all of the talks etc.

The second day was centred around the Unix based OS's. The day was 
kicked off once again with a policeman talking about investigations 
regarding computer crime, which was pretty interesting. The next 2 talks 
were about unix, its security model, and how it can be copmromised. The 
first talk was by a professional in industry (i forget his name), and 
the second was by cr (this guy from irc). Although unix security is a 
huge topic it was summarised pretty well by these 2 talkers. We then moved 
on to firewalls. This kinda sucked because all the talks were companies 
pitching their products, and being the bum that i am i can't afford any 
of them (not that i want a firewall -- im just on a standalone linux 
box with dialup access). Anyway, after this they hada contest whereby 
some of the "hackers" had to try and break the firewall. I am not 
really sure what the result was at the end of it all. Finally, there was 
a talk by John Johnson (a respected person in the security community in 
Australia) sbout the future of the IT industry and where security fit in 
and stuff. This was a good speech as he put things in perspective quite 
well. The day was rounded off by a Q&A panel of prosfessionals and hackers. 
This was very brief though, as time was running short. 

In review, i would say it was really cool to go there and meet people in 
the industry and also see what the people off irc really look like :)
Now i couldn't be bothered writing any more so that's it.
