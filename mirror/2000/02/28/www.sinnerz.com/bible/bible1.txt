                              FAQ about SIN

So you want to know a little more about SIN as a group eh... well here it is, 
all new and revised, just for you.  Read on to learn about who we are, what we
do, and various other all too exciting kinds of info on Self Induced Negativity.


Q: Is SIN a hacking group?
A: NO IT IS NOT.  We never have nor ever will be a hacking group.  We have had 
members in the past who have been known to hack or create programs relative to 
hacking, but the purpose of SIN is not to be hackers.  Do what thou will, whether 
it be hacking or jerking off all day.  We really don't care.

Q: How old are the members of SIN?
A: The ages in our group range from 15 to 28.  Age has no meaning in an 
organization such as this.  We're all cool with each other... that's all that
matters.

Q: Does every member program?
A: Most do code. Not all of us though.  All of the members provide something unique
to the group, whether it be graphics, web design, creating the innovative and 
useful programs that we are most well known for, or whatever.

Q: What are the languages SIN can code in?
A: We have (and have had) members that code in C/C++, Visual Basic, Delphi, Perl, 
ASM, Pascal and various other languages.

Q: Is SIN currently accepting members?
A: Absolutely not.  We are never "accepting members."  Each one of us have been 
invited into the group BY the group.  When people ask us, we say "no," usually 
accompanied by a nice laugh in the face.

Q: How long do you expect SIN to last?
A: As long as we are having fun and feel as though we are accomplishing something.
Most groups die because of lack of interest... but that does not seem likely in the 
near future, as far as we are concerned.

Q: There are people who question SIN and their abilities. What do you have 
as a response?
A: "HAHAHA, eat a cock."  We don't care what others think about us.  However much
you would like to think that we are weak or whatever, get real.  Nobody takes you 
seriously, and even if they did, we still wouldn't give a fuck.  Period.  We do what
we do and we do it well.  Besides, there is much more to a group than ability... we
would like to think that we have it all.  It's FUN.

Q: What is SIN all about?
A: It's about whatever we want it to be about.  Self Induced Negativity is not held 
down by absolute focus on a goal.  We do have goals, but only those that do not hinder 
others.  SIN is about it's members... each one of us are different, making SIN diverse 
and therefore we can do many things in many ways.

Q: Is SIN satanic?
A: No.  A few of us lean towards atheism.  Some of us are non-practicing christian.

Q: Is SIN a member of the Pheer Nation?
A: No, but we do have a member of the Eskimo Nation.

Q: Are you sure you guys aren't a hacking group?
A: Damn sure, Pepe.

Q: Umm... can I be a SIN groupie?
A: No.

Q: Where can I find [ex-member's name here]?
A: We don't know.

Q: What happened to [old program/file/section]?
A: It died. We buried it.

Q: Ummm... who wrote this damn FAQ? It doesn't answer any of my questions!
A: Bummer.
