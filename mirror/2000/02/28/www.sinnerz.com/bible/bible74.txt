The "Everyone else in SIN has some kind of fucked up manifesto type text, why
cant I?" Manifesto

Wierd how things work out..Another day another triumph, another hour, and
you end up with failure and nothing to show for it. Every hello has its
good bye, every high has its down, every drunken stooper has its morning
after-effects.

Life's a pisser, and I refuse to conform to what in reality is "meant to
be". Flip me a quarter but the call wont go through, yet give me an inch
and I will take a mile. Whoop's, theres where things go wrong. Too nice? I
think not, too gullible? Mabye, but thats all relied on from trust. I try
not to trust as many people as I can, its a philosophy that I myself
cannot follow. 

On one side I look at things as if life cannot be as good as it is now,
good job, wonderful friends, computers, money, my art. Yet my greedy
little self wants more, not materalistic speaking, somthing more somthing
there that will make all my wrongs --> right, tell me its not broken.
Again we bump into that ever so decaying word "trust". 

Life's a pisser but then you die. Heh thats what they say right? Fuck damn
shit, assholes. Unsecured energy, unfullfilled thoughts and destiny's that
never arize, this drives me for more, that thing that isnt there, that
destiny that truth, that trust, that energy I waste for NOTHING.

Sorry for not beliving in god. Thats a truth, thats a reality for me, feel
it when your ex-communicated from being somthing that is an honer, feel it
when you feel me, but dont feel what you have then tell me that you have
it becuase then I will just break you down, and kill what makes you, you.

Its funny how 4 really intense days can just spin your world around making
everything you worked your goddamn ass off completly and utterly
irrevalant, black and white, and no color, then having to step BACK into
that old train of thought...I just simply tell myself, give it 3 more
days, 3 more days and things will be back to the norm. But I touched what
I wanted, I touched the god that I didnt belive in, its going to be
hard...So hard.

Deshavu, salutations, and welcome back. Ive been here before, Ive been
here many times before, just keep on telling myself what I want to tell
myself, not making any difference. I was here a year ago, I was here 2
years ago, hell Ive been here since my softmore year in highschool. It
goes away, but comes back every once and a while to haunt me. Thanks for
the wake up call, but the call isnt going to go through, fuck you, eat
busy signal.

Goodbye, lateron, and hastaLavista. Lets play a game, its a game of absolute
deception, tell me one thing so I can find out the alter later. Its fun when
your the referee, but its a bitch when your the player. Next time I want to
be on the offensive side, I want to run the ball down the field and anialate
all of which oppose me.

I quit the search, I quit the rage, I quit everything that has ever meant
anything to me, I wanna sit patheticly at my computers at work, and answer
questions, surf the web and suck up massive amounts of bandwidth while
eating sandwich thinking of nothing else but what is going on at that
particular moment. I wanna grow a beard, isolate myself from the outside
world and become "Mark the creepy hermit". Kids will throw rocks at my
house and I will come out and scream somthing on the lines of "respect". I
want to rule my own empire of creation, and fuck the rest becuase I'm me
and they are them and the rest is you.
