                           The Wanna-be Invasion
                           ---------------------


As the internet allures more and more people into its web every day, more and
more self proclaimed "hackers" start appearing. Now, it is getting to the 
stage where they are everywhere, they infest chat sites, IRC channels, and
so on. "Dont mess with him, hes a hacker man." Its a phrase i have heard a 
million times, and its starting to wear a little thin. 

A hacker, as far as the internet goes, is someone that has a good
 understanding of Unix, etc. and the makeup of the networking involved. They 
are always curious as to the inner workings of the network and therefore 
know its weaknesses. The "hackers" that i have stumbled across in my earlier 
days on the internet are nothing of this sort! Dont be fooled people! These 
people come along, and think "wow! hackers r so cool. ive seen em in movies. 
I am going to be one." So they rock up to a hacking site and read (or browse)
 through a few hacker txts. Good. They now know 2 or so unix commands. So, 
now they are a hacker? Yeah right. They very quickly realise that you can't 
learn hacking overnight so ususally come to a descision such as this: "OK, 
i couldnt be bothered reading all that shit. i dont care what a few basic 
unix commands are. i know. ill get an email bomber. then ill be a hacker."
That is so fucking stupid. How can these people seriously claim to be 
hackers, huh??? Why bother lying to yourself like that?? i cant 
understand this stupid attitude. These people irritate me alot.

I remember one person in particular like this, when i was very new to the 
net. He was always on the chat site that i went to. He is still probably the 
biggest wanna be that i have ever met. he claimed to be a hacker all the 
time, and whenever the chat server went down he would claim that he hacked 
it. One day he paged me in powwow, and basically asked me how to hack. I 
shared the limited knowledge that i had, and told him about the unix basics
that i know and to learn it in more depth. He said "what the fuck is unix?". 
Now, if a hacker doesnt know what unix is, then how the hell can he be a 
hacker on the internet????? hahahah answer: he wasnt.

There was also another guy i knew. He kissed up to me for ages so i would 
tell him this simple java trick i did on him. claimed he knew C++, yet he 
didnt know java or what a loop in programming was (how can u know 'C++' 
without understanding a basic concept like loops??). so i told him it to 
get him off my back. As soon as he did, he claimed he was a great hacker 
for knowing that one java trick!!! crashing a browser isnt even hacking! 
i havent done it for ages cuz its such a waste of time.

The thing that pisses me off about people such as this, is that they claim 
to be hackers and dont even know basic knowledge and much less care about 
it. They just want to sound cool to all their classmates (they r usually 
about 14 or so). They are not interested in required knowledge and when 
it comes down to it, dont have the right mid set to be a hacker. they r not 
curious, they dont read up on things they dont know about, and dont talk to 
people who could help them. They learn a cheap trick and pose with it, and 
are arrogant to everyone else that comes in and "challenges" their ability. 
This is fuckn lame. give up now.

To quote a friend of mine "One cannot claim to be a hacker, the title is 
given to them by others." This i think is true (although the general 
uneducated public are too easily fooled into thinking someone is a 
hacker). I have an ok knowledge of unix, but i still have much to learn, 
there are so many parts of it that are still a mystery to me. But at least 
im making the effort.
