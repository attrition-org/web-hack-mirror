                            Why I love Police

w0w.  Cops are really neet dudes.  First off, Im not one of those vanity
boy, rebel punks who shouts "FUCK ALL PIGS!" in a blind rage of testoroine.
I am however, one who believes that corrupt cops are an overly abundant
commotiy.  One which we do nothing to relieve.

To understand why there are so many corrupt cops, you must first take a look
into the subculture.  Heres a profile of your average bad cop.

 1) Prior experience in the armed forces.
   a. There are many things a person is taught in the Army.  If you havent
      had first hand experience, you wouldnt know.  Its a high pressure, 
      intense enviroment.  Mistakes can be the difference between life and
      death.  Many cops retain this outlook.  They see many criminals as
      "people who are prone to mess up, threrefore a risk to you and I."
      When in reality, this is untrue and biased.  (originally jail was to
      rehabilitate people, to re-enter society.  Now it seems like its just
      to isolate people, society deems unfit.)
   b. There is a law in military code (army atleast) that if you wake
      someone up while they are sleeping.  As a joke, intended to scare them.
      If they were to kill you, as a first instinct... there would be minimal
      punishment to them.  Meaning: "you dont fuck around."  Just an example
      of what your average bad cop's mind set is.
 2) Likes guns.  Likes having guns.  Likes the power associated with guns in
    modern society.
   a. This one speaks for itself.
 3) Views him or herself as a crime fighter, who will rid our streets of
    violence and wrong do'ers.
   a. This is probably the belief that does the police officer the most harm
      Its the belief that "He will save us all."  This, is a good goal.  Id
      love to see the reduction of crime on our streets.  But at the same token,
      the people protecting us have to abide by the same standards as the
      group they are trying to protect.  Or else all you have is the appearence
      of safety, which is a far cry from true, unalienable, safety.
   b. This also leads to the belief "if you arent with me, you are against me."
      Many cops feel they that have all the answers... that if you follow
      them, they will show you a reduction in crime.  Well, thats great.  The
      free flow of ideas is great, its what we call a forum.  But if I were
      to disagree with your methods, that does not nessicarily mean I am
      against your cause.
 4) They arent too brite.
   a. This isnt a knock on them.  But Ive found most corrupt cops are... to
      put it simpley, stupid.  There are however, like everything else in this
      world, the exception.
  [there are actually many more, but these are the main ones] 

When I heard about the police in NYC who sexually assulted the Hatian immigrant,
I wasnt at all surprised.  If you understnad how police think, they way they
are trained, ect.  You wouldnt be surprised too.  I think our whole Judicial
system is in need of an overhaul.
