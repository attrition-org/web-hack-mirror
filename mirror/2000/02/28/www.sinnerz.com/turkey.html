TURKEY DAY DECLARED ILLEGAL BY EPA
<br>
<br>
WASHINGTON, D.C: Today in an hour long dispute, 
Thanksgiving celebration, or as some like to call it, 
Turkey Day, has been declared illegal by the US government. 
Gnoot Gingwhich said, "People are murderous scoundrels. 
They kill turkeys, and for WHAT!? JUST FOR A GOOD FAMILY 
TIME, AND LAUGHTER? SCANDELOUS I TELL YOU, SCANDELOUS!" 
There have been six hundred bomb threats to the whitehouse 
in the past ten minutes alone, mostly by old people who 
like to drink wine while terrorizing their infant 
grandchildren with stories from the past. Says one Bubba 
Jim Joe Jack Jesse Jacky Jimmy Joe "Pay paw" Johnson, 
"Ah yoosed tah tell mah grayund sun storahs, now these 
government hoes be comin' along like some oh dem black folk 
back in the thirties, tryin to steal mah property and whatnot..." 
Unfortunately we couldn't print his entire story as that 
would have taken up the whole "E" section.

<br>
	The EPA declared that Turkeys have the same rights 
as humans, and that even though they taste good with stuffing, 
people shouldn't be so cruel. Miss somethingorother, the 
spokeswoman for the EPA, says, "We basically banned Thanksgiving 
because no one in the EPA really enjoys having fun with our 
family. Mostly, our families are inbred cult leaders with 
genital problems." When asked why they had to press their 
personal problems on everyone else in the nation, she
replied, "Don't fuck with the Turkeys, yo, or else I'll get 
my tree-hugging homies to incarcerate your ass."

<br>
"If I see another Turkey with it's head missing... 
we'll bomb all major Turkey slaughterhouses and stores that
carry Turkey or Turkey products. These are cowardly acts, and 
they should be punished severely for even THINKING about hurting 
those poor ugly looking creatures who don't do shit except run 
around and make annoying fucking gobbling sounds. Oh what the hell 
am I saying, I think everyone should go out and cap one just for the 
fun of it." These were President Bill Klintocks words right before he 
was incarcerated by a bunch of people dressed in bell-bottoms and wearing 
"hippy looking shit," as the Vice President put it.
