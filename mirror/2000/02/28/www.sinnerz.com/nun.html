A nun in a local convent today was the latest of the WIPO Copyright
Treaties Implementation Act put forward by the World Intellectual
Property Organization. The treaty made all public bug reports
illegal without the consent of the owners of the program in question.
Due to the total lack of discussion regarding security flaws,
the number of infiltrated servers and vandalized web pages have
increased geometrically. JP of AntiOnline.com, a well-known media whore,
has estimated that a page is vandalized every 20 seconds, by hackers
running automated scripts from stolen accounts on foreign servers.
Sister MaryJoseph O'Man of the Our Lady Of Big Spikey Things Convent was the
latest casualty in this brutal war.<br>
<br>
According to police reports, two hackers broke into O'Man's
quarters last night at around 1:00 in the morning.<br><br>
"There were two of them" said O'Man. "One of them was really excited
he talked funny, like everything was spelled with 'x's. They told me
they wanted to anal box me, and that if I cooperated, they wouldn't
make me a member of the Pheer Nation. They pulled out what I guess
you could call their penises, but they weren't much. They forced me
down on my knees, and one of them just came all over my face. The one
who talked funny was looking at the other one's pecker, and then he
came right after him. They pulled up their pants and ran out of the
building."<br>
"The hackers probably bypassed the building's security system or
something. God knows how they do it. I mean, the building was
equipped with Microsloth Lock98. Microsloth says it's totally
unbreakable. They must have had the key." said an anonymous
source at the police office.<br>
<br>
Sister MaryJoseph O'Man is currenty being held on charges of
copyright violation, due to the hand-made copy of the Lord's
Prayer she had in her home.
