        In a highly organized protest occuring last 
saturday, computer hackers gathered in front of Lewis 
Junior High School to solicit the release of "Kervin", a 
pet rock confiscated at the school computer lab by 
teacher Elaine Marken. Kervin, an arrow-head shaped 
rock, was impounded nearly 6 months ago when Mrs. Marken 
found a group of teenagers trying to "crack" the 
computer's CPU with Kervin. 
<br>
<br>    
        "This is completely unfair! We know hacking is 
illegal. But we don't think smashing the rock into the 
disk drive was destructive. In the end, it would have 
exposed essential flaws in the architecture," says a 
12-year-old hacker by the nick "olos."  Olos declined to 
mention why those flaws did not exist until he and his 
friends clamped a padlock on the network card and 
motherboard in an attempt to "secure the system." 
<br>
<br>
        "Free Kervin!" shouts the predominantly male 
group gathered in front of the junior high school.  They 
are an intimidating eight people, unfazed as the other 
children toss milk boxes in their faces.  One hacker 
speaks with a megaphone: "Currently the NYC public 
school system has kept Kervin in Mrs. Marken's desk 
drawer without bail, without a trial, and has 
consistently violated its constitutional rights! This 
case affects all of us, and our rights as citizens!" 
claims hacker ringleader Emmaculate Goldspleen. 
Goldspleen runs a popular hacker 'zine, whose young
kiddie-haxor market also serves as a pool for models for 
his photography hobby. Goldspleen declined to 
comment on this subject other than this statement: 
"Little boys are very beautiful to me and my friend Mr. 
Pokey."
<br><br>
        Kervin is a modern-day political prisoner who 
has been put away for something people don't 
understand." Rumors indicate that this refers to the 
fact that 'Kervin' is involved in Emmaculate's bizarre 
masturbation routine.
<br><br>
        Goldspleen stood determined. "We must fight for
the freedom of Kervin, or all hackers everywhere are in
danger. Please send me 45.95 and a baby picture of
 yourself, and I will send you my magazine so you too 
can be a k-r4d hax0r!"
