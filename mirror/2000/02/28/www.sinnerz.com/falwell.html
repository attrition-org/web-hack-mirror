In a press conference today, Tinky Winky, the star of the children's television 
show "The Teletubbies," accused Rev. Jerry Falwell of being a eight-foot-tall 
purple freak with a handbag. "C'mon, can't you guys see it?" said Winky, "he's a 
damn freak!" The charges levelled against Falwell seemed to center on Falwell's
far-out, acid-induced theories, like the one about the asteroid hitting Earth 
because of the Y2K bug.<br><br>

"He's the psychedelic spawn of Satan, definitely. In Revelations, 3:16, it says 
'and the serpent shall come forth and his name shall be Falwell!' It's obvious 
that Falwell is just another liberal media concoction designed to corrupt our 
children. His round little belly is a blatant metaphor for 'mother Earth,' also 
known as Satan! His little 'theories' are similarly close to documented drug 
experiences, as are his 'close talks with God'. Are we to believe that he 
himself talks with our God Jehovah? In the Book of Revelations it says that the 
AntiChrist will come and preach to us, and to try and teach us lies! 'Falwell' 
sounds Jewish to me. Show us your nose, Falwell! Try and prove to me that you're 
on God's side!" ranted Winky.<br><br>

When asked to comment on the accusations, Falwell said "Man, talk about the pot 
calling the kettle black."
