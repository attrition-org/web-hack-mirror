<tt>Men with small penises worldwide are marvelling at Cyliclin, a
revolutionary pill that claims to provide relief for men whose genitals
are "underdeveloped", "disproportionate", or "imploded." Released only
shortly after Viagra(tm), the lesser known Pfister Pharmaceuticals 
introduced Cyliclin, a drug highly anticipated by inadequate-
peniied males worldwide. "This drug has been like a dream for me,"
says NYC based writer John Compton. "Do you know what it was like to
go through my teenage years with my cock in my hands, my penis forever 
hidden because of the shame I felt? Do you know how I cried my 
senior prom because my date LAUGHED at me? Laughed, I tell you!"
<br>
<br>
Makers say the drug stimulates growth nerves in the penis that
lay dormant after adolescence actually causing a man's shaft to "grow"
up to .5 inches longer than the current length in a period of 6 months.
Long time user Alex Cefalo gives his personal account:<br>
<br>
<strong>Interviewer</strong>: So Mr. Cefalo, you've been using Cyliclin for about 5
months now.<br>
<strong>Cefalo</strong>: Why yes, yes I have.<br>
<strong>Interviewer</strong>: Tell us what it's done for you.<br>
<strong>Cefalo</strong>: [pulls out two pictures] Well, you can see for yourself. This
photo is before I started taking the pill. And this is after. Notice the incredible difference?<br>
<strong>Interviewer</strong>: Uh.... no.<br>
<strong>Cefalo</strong>: What the fuck do you mean? Look, that's at least an extra 3.5
millimeters there buddy.<br>
<strong>Interviewer</strong>: Um.. It looks like you just stuck Silly Putty to the head
of your penis, sir.<br>
<strong>Cefalo</strong>: well.. um.. FUCK YOU! I don't have to take this. [storms out
of the room]<br><br>
        "He still sucks in bed," asserts girlfriend Janet Arnette. "One day I actually caught him hiding a dildo in his other hand when he climbed on top of me, intending to fool me into thinking that was his dick... It was a sad, sad day."<br>
<br>
        Mr. Compton boasts of his success. "Yesterday, a girl shifted 
her eyes and almost looked at me as I was walking down 5th street. I
tell you man, it is only a matter of time before I get laid!  Um.. I mean.. I've had sex dozens of times with many, many beautiful women! Please, don't publish that other statement. Oh god.. oh god... ! [runs off]"<br>
<br>
        Pfister states that tests of the effectiveness of Cycliclin are
still unconclusive. However, 190,000 men worldwide have purchased the
drug, making it more popular than Di-boxyl, the serum that treats
amblyopia ("lazy eye") in inbred mountain goats.</tt>
