In a press release early monday morning, AnonymousPrick.com founder J. Anonymous admitted to the accusations 
that he was indeed a homosexual. Many people had suspected that the known media whore was a "butt 
pirate" and "pillow biter" but he always denied it. Then in the last week his collection of gay
porn was found hidden at anonymousprick.com/manseckz. Knowing he was caught Mr. Anonymous decided to come clean
and admit that he had been attracted to the opposite sex ever since he was 9.
<br>
<br>
"That was the main reason I craved attention and wrote such bullshit articles on my site." stated
Mr. Anonymous. "I wanted to be known as Mr. Anonymous the hacker not Mr. Anonymous the fudge packer." That however is not all to
this story. Mr. Anonymous also has secretly been behind the attacks on several servers that are calling for
the government to FREE KERVIN. Why is this? Mr. Anonymous was not willing to comment but many believe that 
the two were actually lovers a few years ago.
<br><br>
Many of Mr Anonymous' loyal, yet ignorant followers were shocked at the news. "Sure he always acted a wee
bit faggy but I never would have thought he was actually a fairy," said SuperHackBoy, who has
now started up the HAFH or Hackers Against Fag Hackers. But Mr. Anonymous isn't too worried of this group
made up of ex-anonymousprick.com readers, after all they did learn from his site.
<br><br>
What does Mr. Anonymous plan to do with truth finally out? Well our sources tell us that he plans to write
a book about the true story of his life since he knows the media will buy it, then he is going
to move to San Francisco one of the homosexual capitals of the world and open up a spandex store.
<br><br>

In related news police phone lines have been crammed with calls coming in from parents that have
come home too find their kids dead as a result of an almost ritualistic suicide. Investigations
are looking into the matter to find out if the news of Mr. Anonymous' gay activities are behind the 
incidents. Why Mr. Anonymous? Each child found dead had their computers on and their browsers pointed at
http://www.anonymousprick.com. Coincidence? If the government does find out it was because of Mr. Anonymous'
ongoing conspiracy then the President has ordered that he be castrated, hung upside down by his
toes, and forced to listen to Michael Jacksons song "Beat It" over and over and over. All I can
say is GOD BLESS AMERICA!
