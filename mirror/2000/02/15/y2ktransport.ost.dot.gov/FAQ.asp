<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<B><U>Department of Transportation:</U></B>
<P>
<B>Q: Is the Department of Transportation responsible for the computers that are part of the transportation system?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> DOT owns and is responsible for the Federal Aviation Administration's air traffic control system computers and the U.S. Coast Guard's maritime transportation computer systems.  Other DOT systems which have been identified as mission-critical are part of DOT's internal operations.  The transportation industry, both in the public and private sector, has responsibility for their own computers.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Are the DOT computer systems ready for Year 2000?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> As of June 30, all of DOT's 608 mission-critical systems will be Y2K compliant except for 11 Coast Guard systems.  The Coast Guard systems will be made compliant by Sept. 30, 1999, well before the end of the year.  DOT's mission-critical systems will be renovated in time to avoid threats to public safety, disruption in the movement of goods, or inconvenience to the traveling public.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Is DOT involved with making the transportation system Y2K compliant?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes.  Although DOT does not have direct responsibility for the computers operated by the transportation industry and state and local government transportation agencies, the Department has conducted a continuing outreach program to industry trade associations, companies, and government agencies to increase awareness of the Y2K problem and to help in achieving compliance.  The status of specific parts of the transportation sector are discussed below.
</P>
<BR>
<B><U>Rail:</U></B>
<P>
<B>Q:  Will Amtrak and commuter railroads be affected by Y2K?</B>
<OL TYPE="a">
	<LI>How will trains be affected by the Y2K problem?
	<LI>Is it just the engine?
</OL>
<B>A:</B> Amtrak and the commuter railroads have examined both their operating systems (dispatching, signals, grade 
	crossings, etc.) and their business systems (ticketing, reservations, scheduling) and have successfully corrected 
	those few systems where a Y2K problem existed. They anticipate that trains will run as planned on Jan. 1, 2000 and 
	the following days, and that customers will continue to be able to obtain information, tickets, and reservations. 
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Are the switching systems for trains timed or date-sensitive? Or are they event-driven? Will this cause a problem in the Year 2000?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> In general, because of the design of safety-critical railroad signaling, dispatching, and telecommunications 
	systems and of the operating rules that accompany them, the railroad industry does not anticipate that Y2K problems 
	would increase the risk of collision. These systems are all event-driven.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: How will the train crossing guards be affected by Y2K?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Grade crossing signals are free of Y2K problems because they are event-driven, rather than time- or date-driven. 
	Electronic event recording systems keep track of grade crossing signal operation, but the signals are designed to operate 
	even if the event recorders malfunctioned due to a Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: How many engines in the United States might have computers or embedded chips in them?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The US railroad industry collectively owns approximately 20,000 diesel-electric locomotives. Sixty-five percent 
	of these were built before 1985 and have no on-board electronics. Only those locomotives built since 1985 have 
	on-board microprocessors. The two principal U.S. manufacturers of locomotives, General Motors and General Electric, 
	have confirmed that there are no Y2K problems associated with embedded microprocessors. The only issues reported so 
	far are associated with fault reporting systems and do not affect actual locomotive operations.
<B>Q:Is the Federal Transit Administration reviewing the Y2K readiness of transit systems?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> For its part, FTA has accelerated its industry outreach, management oversight and survey of the Y2K compliance 
	of the nation's transit systems. Transit agencies unable to meet a June 30, 1999, Y2K compliance deadline established 
	for FTA grantees were required to submit a contingency letter outlining their plans for continuation of system 
	operations while repairing or replacing non-compliant elements.
	<BR><BR>
	For additional information, see the Federal Railroad Administration website 
	(<A HREF="http://www.fra.dot.gov/doc/y2k/index.htm" TARGET="_blank" OnMouseOver="message('Federal Railroad Administration'); return true">http://www.fra.dot.gov/doc/y2k/index.htm</A>) 
</P>
<BR>
<B><U>Transit:</U></B>
<P>
<B>Q: Will subways and buses be affected by Y2K?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The answer depends on the system of each transit agency. Although there is no universal answer, most control 
	systems for bus and train systems are not date-dependent. The Federal Transit Administration has participated in many 
	meetings and workshops with the transit industry to help prepare buses and subways for Y2K.  However, some transit 
	riders may experience disruptions in service if those providers have not adequately prepared for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Do some of the subways have computers piloting them and if so, will there be a person driving them on January 1, 2000?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> All trains have operators. And, for the most part, computer systems that control trains are not date-dependent. 
	In the instance where a train system is controlled by a date-dependent system, the train operator can always manually 
	operate trains.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Has anyone made sure that buses are compliant?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Every transit service provider which receives federal funding must certify to the Federal Transit Administration 
	that it is fully able to operate next year. Any transit provider that will not be able to provide transit services, 
	due to Y2K or any other reason, will not receive FTA funds. This action is being taken to ensure the safety of transit 
	passengers and will affect the majority of transit operations. However, Y2K compliance is ultimately the 
	responsibility of the transit provider. Most bus operations are not affected by Y2K.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Do the manufacturers know what might happen?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Manufacturers are aware of the Y2K issue and are working with transit agencies to minimize any possible disruptions in service.
<BR><BR>
For additional information, see the Federal Transit Administration website 
(<A HREF="http://www.fta.dot.gov/Y2K/index.htm" TARGET="_blank" OnMouseOver="message('Federal Transit Administration'); return true">http://www.fta.dot.gov/Y2K/index.htm</A>) 
</P>
<BR>
<B><U>Automobiles:</U></B>
<P>
<B>Q: Will there be any problem with automobiles or their embedded microchips because of the Y2K Problem?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> No, according to most major auto manufacturers, Y2K will not affect the safety and performance of their vehicles. 
	In February 1999, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) surveyed major auto manufacturers to 
	identify potential Y2K-related impacts in motor vehicles due to embedded microchips. The auto manufacturers surveyed 
	were: DaimlerChrysler, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota, and 
	Volkswagen-Audi. These companies collectively manufacture approximately 90% of the cars and light trucks sold in the 
	United States. NHTSA maintains Y2K product compliance information received from these and other auto manufacturers on 
	its Internet website at 
	<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/nhtsa/whatis/y2k/" TARGET="_blank" OnMouseOver="message('NHTSA product compliance information'); return true">http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/nhtsa/whatis/y2k/</A>.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Are there any date-dependent systems in my car that will be affected by the Y2K Problem?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Auto manufacturers report that very few vehicles contain devices that process, track, or utilize dates in their 
	operation.  Global Positioning System (GPS) is the primary means of determining the location of the vehicle and giving 
	the information to the driver or an emergency-response authority. None of the manufacturers surveyed by the National 
	Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) indicated that Y2K would adversely affect the operation of their GPS 
	system or the vehicle. The manufacturers surveyed were DaimlerChrysler, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Mazda, 
	Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota, and Volkswagen-Audi, which collectively manufacture approximately 90% of 
	the cars and light trucks sold in the United States.
	<BR><BR>
	For more information on the GPS Y2K issues and a similar issue called "GPS End-of-Week (EOW) Rollover," see below or 
	see <A HREF="http://www.navcen.uscg.mil/gps/geninfo/y2k/default.htm" TARGET="_blank" OnMouseOver="message('Information on the GPS Y2K issues'); return true">http://www.navcen.uscg.mil/gps/geninfo/y2k/default.htm</A>
	or call <B>1-800-368-5647</B>. NHTSA maintains Y2K product compliance information received from these and other auto 
	manufacturers on its Internet website at 
	<A HREF="http://www.navcen.uscg.mil/gps/geninfo/y2k/default.htm" TARGET="_blank" OnMouseOver="message('NHTSA Y2K product compliance information'); return true">http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/nhtsa/whatis/y2k/</A>.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Are there concerns that ambulances will not be able to run?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Vehicle manufacturers have given assurances that ambulances will not be affected by
     Y2K-related computer problems. The manufacturers say the vehicle chassis-based computers
     and micorprocessors that control the engine, transmission, anti-lock brakes, automatic traction
     control, heating and air conditioning systems and numerous other smaller systems on the
     ambulances will not have Y2K-related problems. Emergency services that require ambulances
     will not be curtailed as a result of Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Where can I find more information on automobiles and the Y2K problem?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> NHTSA is providing a consolidated list of Internet links on its Year 2000 Internet web-site 
	(<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/nhtsa/whatis/y2k/" TARGET="_blank" OnMouseOver="message('NHTSA Y2K product compliance information'); return true">http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/nhtsa/whatis/y2k/</A>) 
	as an added source of information for the public. Those auto manufacturers who voluntarily provide product compliance 
	information on their respective Internet sites will be listed on NHTSA's Year 2000 Internet site.  
</P>
<BR>
<B><U>Traffic Lights:</U></B>
<P>
<B>Q: Will traffic lights work? Are there systems in place to prevent the lights from going down?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Traffic signals will work in a safe mode as long as power is available. If computers malfunction, signal 
	timing could operate out of coordination, causing inconvenience to motorists. In the worst case, signals could revert to 
	the emergency flash mode. A very small number of intersections may have back-up generators, but it is rare case for an 
	individual intersection to have back-up power. The only known safety issue relates to jurisdictions where traffic signal 
	control equipment is used to operate reversible lane control signs. If the control software does not recognize the 
	Year 2000 conversion, the wrong day-of-week command may be issued to the lane control signs.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Are there embedded chips in either the light itself or in a junction box?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes, signals have embedded chips in the controller cabinet.
	<BR><BR>
	For additional information, see the Federal Highway Administration website at 
	(<A HREF="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/y2k/index.htm" TARGET="_blank" OnMouseOver="message('Federal Highway Administration'); return true">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/y2k/index.htm</A>). 
</P>
<BR> 
<B><U>Air:</U></B>
<P>
<B>Q: Will it be safe to fly on and after January 1, 2000?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Safety of air travel is the most important concern of the FAA. A primary goal of the FAA is to ensure that the 
	National Airspace System (NAS) operates safely through the Year 2000 and beyond. Several steps have been taken toward 
	achieving this goal:
<UL>
<LI> All systems owned and operated by the FAA, including the National Airspace System, have been certified Year 2000 compliant.
<LI> In the highly unlikely event of system outages due to Year 2000 issues, contingency plans are being updated for each FAA system.
<LI> In addition to system contingency plans, an agency-wide contingency plan is also being developed.
</UL>
	The agency has always been committed to maintaining the highest level of air traffic safety and efficiency.  
	However, the FAA would reduce air traffic capacity before compromising the safety of the National Airspace System and 
	the public. The FAA will maintain its commitment to safety into the Year 2000 and beyond.  For additional information on 
	FAA's Y2K Program and for other related links, please visit 
	<A HREF="http://www.faay2k.com" TARGET="_blank" OnMouseOver="message('FAA Y2K Program Office'); return true">www.faay2k.com</A>.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q:  Are the airports Year 2000 compliant?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The FAA is responsible for certain systems at airports, such as ones that are directly
     involved with air safety. These systems have been certified Year 2000 compliant. The remainder of the systems, such as the ones that are involved with handling baggage
     and maintaining security for example, are the responsibility of the individual airports.
<BR>
<BR>
The FAA has concluded visits to the top 150 certificated airports, which enplane 94 percent of passengers in the U.S., and 
will contact the remaining 416 airports to assess their compliance with Federal safety regulations. The FAA is providing 
each airport with a list of that airport's systems which support Part 139 safety requirements and will require compliance 
on or before Jan. 1, 2000.
<BR>
<BR>
Based on data gathered by the FAA's Airports and Regulation and Certification organizations as of June 30, 1999, of the 
top 20 airports that account for 90 percent of U.S. international passengers, one-half are Y2K compliant. By September 30, 
1999, 80 percent of these airports expect to be compliant, with the remainder expecting to be compliant by the end of the year.
<BR>
<BR>
The FAA regulates airfield safety under the Airport Certification Program, and will take all
 measures necessary to maintain the safety of airfield operations at certificated airports.
 Certificated airports are required to comply with FAA regulations. If a certificated airport uses
 computer equipment, that equipment must be Y2K compliant or the airport must have an
 alternate means of complying with the regulation that doesn't rely on the computer.
<BR>
<BR>
If an airport operator fails to make Y2K repairs to critical equipment or to develop an alternate means of complying with 
requirements, the FAA will restrict or suspend air carrier operations at that airport as necessary to maintain safety. 
There are also many other computerized systems at airports, typically owned by the airport operator, air carriers, or 
tenants, which do not affect aviation safety but which could affect efficient use of the airport by airport users and 
passengers. Airport operators and air carriers are very aware of these potential impacts and are working to identify, 
assess, and repair all of their computer systems on the airport that could affect air transportation.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Will there be a problem with airline reservations systems?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Although the FAA does not own or operate airline reservations systems, early indications
     show that these systems are not affected by the Y2K problem (source: "Travel Industry Passes
     Y2k Test," AP Business News, February 5, 1999). February 4, 1999 was the first day most
     airline systems could book tickets for January 1, 2000, and no Y2K-related problems were
     apparent. In addition to major airlines, many car rental and other travel industry businesses that also began booking 
	 reservations have so far avoided any Y2K-related glitches.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: What about the safety of airplanes?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> FAA is responsible for monitoring the safety of airplanes, not for making the actual fixes to airplanes' 
	computer systems. The two major manufacturers of commercial airplanes, Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie, have both 
	issued statements declaring that neither company has identified any Year 2000 related issues that could affect the safety 
	or normal operation of any aircraft. Dates and times are used mostly for flight planning purposes. Engines, landing gear 
	and flight control systems are not date-sensitive and will function regardless of date or time.
	<BR><BR>
	Further information can be obtained on the Y2K activities of these companies on their web sites: 
	<A HREF="http://www.boeing.com" TARGET="_blank" OnMouseOver="message('Boeing web site'); return true">www.boeing.com</A> and 
	<A HREF="http://www.airbus.com" TARGET="_blank" OnMouseOver="message('Airbus web site'); return true">www.airbus.com</A>.

</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Are the nation's airlines ready for the Year 2000?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> On July 1, 1999, the Aviation Millennium Project, announced that major U.S. and Canadian carriers have completed 
95 percent of their Y2K remediation and implementation, with full completion expected by the end of the September. 
These airlines have spent more than $750 million on their Y2K efforts. The Aviation Millennium Project, which involves 102 
airlines, is sponsored by the Air Transport Association (ATA) and works in partnership with the Air Transport Association 
of Canada, and the Regional Airline Association (RAA). ATA members account for 95 percent of all U.S. domestic passenger 
and cargo service.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: What about power outages?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) reports that live tests of electric generators that were 
	fixed for Y2K problems have resulted in no critical failures that would have caused a shutdown of power systems.
<BR>
<BR>
If a power outage were to take place on January 1, 2000, the FAA has existing contingency plans in place to continue operations. 
These contingency plans are used routinely, such as when a major thunderstorm causes a local power outage. All Air Traffic 
Control systems have back-up generators that provide necessary power in case of an outage. For example, one Air Traffic 
Control Center has three back-up generators, although only one generator would be sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: What about fuel delivery systems?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> FAA is responsible for systems at airports that are directly involved with air safety. These systems have been certified Year 2000 compliant. 
	The remainder of the systems, such as fuel delivery systems, is the responsibility of the individual airports. Such
     systems represent an economic, rather than safety, issue to the airport. The FAA is working
     closely with the airports across the country to minimize the possibility of travel disruptions on
     January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Will international flights be affected?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The FAA does not have regulatory authority over other countries' aviation operations or
     systems. However, the FAA is currently working with the International Civil Aviation
     Organization (ICAO) and other key international aviation organizations - including the
     International Air Transport Association (IATA) - to determine Y2K status of other countries.
	 <BR><BR>
	The process through which travelers will be advised about the Y2K readiness of foreign aviation systems, airports and airlines will be announced soon.
<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. Department of Transportation is heading an international Year 2000 civil aviation evaluation process which is 
reviewing and evaluating information about the Year 2000 (Y2K) readiness of foreign air traffic service providers, 
foreign airports, and foreign air carriers flying into and out of the United States.
<BR><BR>
The process, which includes representatives from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Department of 
Defense, will also work with the U.S. State Department and other governmental agencies, as appropriate. 
It will review and evaluate all available information regarding the Y2K readiness of foreign air traffic services 
providers and airports used by U.S. airlines, as well as foreign airlines.
<BR><BR>
The evaluation process will issue individual statements on foreign nations' civil aviation systems. 
Beginning in September, travelers will be able to access information at 
<A HREF="http://www.dot.gov/fly2k" TARGET="_blank" OnMouseOver="message('Access Traveler Information'); return true">http://www.dot.gov/fly2k</A>.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Will there be a problem with security at the airports?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The FAA Civil Aviation Security Year 2000 Program Office distributed a survey to most
     large- and medium-sized hub airports. All those surveyed responded, confirming that either
     they are already Y2K compliant or will be so in the near future.
<BR>
<BR>
All new explosive detection systems are Y2K compliant. Older explosive detection systems have been modified to be Y2K 
compliant. Metal detectors do not have any date-related operations and thus do not require any Y2K repairs.
</P>
<BR>
<B><U>Domestic and International Maritime:</U></B>
<P>
<B>Q: Will it be safe to take a cruise, or is maritime safety threatened by Y2K?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Preliminary assessments by the U. S. Coast Guard and MARAD, as well as a large number of marine transportation 
	system associations, indicate that most large international companies have given the Y2K problem high level attention, 
	have assessed their Y2K issues, and have active and comprehensive Y2K programs in place. Included among these companies 
	are the large cruise lines. These programs include repair of their internal systems and equipment, and the writing of 
	business continuity contingency plans. The picture is less consistent among small and medium sized shipping companies, 
	as well as smaller cruise line companies.  There are still concerns regarding the readiness of ports both with respect to 
	support organizations worldwide, such as customs, and the public infrastructure that supports the ports, such as power, 
	water, and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Is the international maritime system prepared for the Year 2000?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Geographically, the Mid and Far East, former Soviet Union, and some parts of Latin merica lead concerns. 
	There also continues to be some concern regarding ship electronics, including Global Marine Distress and Safety 
	System (GMDSS); Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) and Electronic Chart Display Information System (ECDIS) systems 
	that interface with shore-based systems.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: How is the international shipping industry preparing for the Year 2000?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The Coast Guard also is reaching out to the industry internationally. On March 3 and 4 it convened, with the 
	UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency, a meeting of 16 international  marine transportation system trade associations at 
	the headquarters of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London. The associations represent the majority 
	of the tonnage, ports,  marine transportation industry personnel and marine insurers in the world. Participants agreed 
	upon a Year 2000 Code of Good Practice for the international marine transportation industry, and handed it over to the 
	IMO, who immediately issued the Code as an IMO Circular. As the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) was 
	represented at the meeting, and was a major contributor to the Code, they can be expected to be a strong advocate for 
	adoption by their members of the Code's practice on safe conduct of operations and contingency planning. 
	The Code can be accessed on the web at 
	<A HREF="http://www.tvontheweb.com" TARGET="_blank" OnMouseOver="message('Year 2000 Code of Good Practice'); return true">http://www.tvontheweb.com</A>. 
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Are domestic ports prepared for the Year 2000?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The U.S. Coast Guard is conducting a national readiness assessment at 48
     ports around the nation, and is working closely with the shipping and port
     industries to insure efforts are underway throughout the marine transportation system to reach readiness and to have 
	 contingency plans in place to ensure safe and continued operations.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Has the Coast Guard made a determination on the safety of ports for the Year 2000?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The U.S. Coast Guard has announced that U.S. ports will remain open on Jan. 1, 2000,
     and that the agency will collect information from vessel operators and ports to assure that the
     Year 2000 (Y2K) computer problem does not impact maritime safety.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: What effect will the Year 2000 problem have on the barge industry (oil, garbage, et al)?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The barge industry appears in large measure to be responsibly addressing the Y2K problem.  However, there is 
	still a clear possibility of disruptions. Such disruptions, if they take place, could  delay the movement of goods and 
	people. The maritime industry is complex, and internationally linked, so that disruptions around the world could be felt 
	in U. S. ports and in the U. S. economy. The barge industry reported in a recent meeting on the continuity of coal 
	delivery that they did not anticipate Y2K problems that would affect their operations.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: What is the Coast Guard doing to assure Y2K compliance in the shipping industry?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The Coast Guard is taking active steps to insure that the industry is not only addressing the Y2K problem, 
	but putting in  place and testing Y2K contingency plans. On June 14 and 15, an assessment was made of the readiness of the 
	Coast Guard, the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, and three private-sector transportation providers -- containership 
	company APL, the tanker division of oil producer ARCO, and tugboat operator  Crowley Marine Services -- for responding to 
	potential Year 2000 mishaps. Scenarios included simulations of an oil spill, telecommunications problems and the failure 
	of a port's vessel-traffic system, which controls ship movements in the harbor.  The Coast Guard will conduct at least 
	three additional tests during 1999, including one of the search and rescue system.  Though disruptions cannot be ruled 
	out, the U.S. Coast Guard will act on its authority to protect the health and safety of the public in U.S. waters.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: How will the Year 2000 Computer problem impact the St. Lawrence Seaway?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The St. Lawrence Seaway will most likely be closed for the winter, as usual, when the millennium arrives and 
	will not reopen until the end of March or beginning of April. Accordingly, any problems associated  with the Year 2000 
	would not have any direct impact on Seaway traffic on or about January 1, 2000, and similarly should not have any 
	appreciable effect on sufficient vessel availability for the 2000 Seaway shipping season beginning three months later.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: How will the Coast Guard determine whether ports and ships are Y2K compliant?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The Coast Guard will assess the ability of individual vessels and facilities to operate safely and reliably, and 
	allow those that can demonstrate that they have adequately addressed their Y2K compliance to continue operating normally. 
	Where there are concerns for safety, operational restrictions could be imposed by the local Coast Guard captain of the port.

The Coast Guard will gather and assess information on operators' Y2K preparations, and
 impose operational restrictions only if the operator's level of Y2K preparedness raises safety
 concerns. The idea is to have a consistent, nationwide approach that will protect life, property
 and the marine environment while recognizing the importance of ocean transportation to the
 nation's economy. The Coast Guard's criteria will focus on the maritime operators' efforts to
 evaluate and repair their computer systems, as well as the adequacy of their contingency plans
 to address possible Year 2000-related failures.

<P>
<B>Q: How serious is the Year 2000 problem in the maritime transportation industry?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The Coast Guard is treating the Year 2000 problem with the same heightened state of
 readiness that it would employ with other marine hazards, such as spills and severe storms.
 From a maritime safety perspective, however, Coast Guard policy-makers do not think the
 year 2000 presents an unmanageable problem. Rather, the key is to have contingency plans in
 place and then rigorously test them.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: How is the Coast Guard using the Code of Good Practice?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The centerpiece of the Coast Guard's Y2K policy is the Year 2000 Code of Good Practice that recently was 
	published by the International Maritime Organization. The document provides questionnaires for the exchange of information 
	about an organization's Y2K preparations. The information gathered by the questionnaire will be used in combination with 
	a Coast Guard risk assessment matrix to "score" a vessel and its level of Y2K preparedness. The resulting "grade" will 
	determine whether a vessel may proceed normally or have restrictions placed upon it.

<B><U>Global Positioning System (GPS):</U></B>
<P>
<B>Q: What is GPS?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> GPS is a satellite-based system that allows consumers who use electronic receivers to
     determine their location. Recreational boaters and pilots, hikers, campers, hunters, and
     fishermen are among the consumers who rely on GPS receivers. The military and businesses
     also use GPS. 
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Is Jan. 1, 2000 the only date of concern to GPS users?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Users of the Global Positioning System (GPS) should be aware of two important dates: 
     Aug. 22, 1999, the "End-of-Week" (EOW) rollover; and Jan. 1, 2000 (Y2K).
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: What is End-of-the-Week Rollover?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> The GPS EOW rollover occurs every 1,024 weeks -- about once every 20 years. 
	The GPS system calculates time by counting the number of weeks since Jan. 6, 1980 -- 
	up to a maximum of 1,023 weeks. At midnight between Aug. 21-22, 1999, the GPS week 
	"counter" rolled back to zero weeks. The Department of Defense (DOD)  says the rollover 
	will not create problems for the GPS satellites that transmit location information but it 
	could present a problem for consumers who use older GPS receivers and related applications. 
	That's because after Aug. 21, 1999, receivers could process satellite data incorrectly and 
	display inaccurate information.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: What will happen to GPS receivers that are not prepared for EOW?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Consumers who depend on GPS for geographic locations at sea, on land or in the air, 
	may experience one of the following problems with their receiver:
	<OL>
	<LI>It will be unable to locate the satellites, resulting in the receiver not working
	<LI>It will take more time than usual to locate the satellites
	<LI>It will appear to be working but display inaccurate positions, times or dates
	</OL>
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: Will the Year 2000 date change (Y2K) impact GPS?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> DOD has determined that the GPS satellites which transmit location information will 
	operate properly after Dec. 31, 1999. But if consumer GPS receivers and applications are 
	not Y2K-ready, they could process satellite data incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: What should GPS receiver owners do?</B>
<BR>
<B>A:</B> If you use GPS, check with your receiver manufacturer to find out if your receiver 
	and applications are ready for the Aug. 22, 1999 EOW rollover- and Y2K. 
	You may want to check the Coast Guard Navigation Center's web site
	(<A HREF="http://www.navcen.uscg.mil/gps/geninfo/y2k/default.htm" TARGET="_blank" OnMouseOver="message('Coast Guard Navigation Center'); return true">http://www.navcen.uscg.mil/gps/geninfo/y2k/default.htm</A>), 
	where the Department of Transportation has posted a list of receiver manufacturers and 
	contacts. You also can call the free Y2K consumer hotline (1-888-USA-4-Y2K) for manufacturer 
	contact information. You will need to tell the manufacturer your receiver's model, 
	serial number, and the firmware version or release date displayed on the startup screen.
	<BR><BR>
	Further information about Y2K issues and marine transportation can also be obtained by visiting the U. S. Coast Guard 
	website at 
	<A HREF="http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-m/y2k.htm" TARGET="_blank" OnMouseOver="message('U. S. Coast Guard website'); return true">http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-m/y2k.htm</A> 
	or by calling the USCG infoline at 1-800-368-5647. Anyone using a GPS receiver is 
	encouraged to contact the manufacturer directly to verify the readiness of the GPS receiver 
	and other electronic navigation equipment.
