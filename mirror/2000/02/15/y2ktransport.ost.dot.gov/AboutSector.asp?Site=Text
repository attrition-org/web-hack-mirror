<h3>About the Transportation Sector</h3>

	<blockquote>
	<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Times New Roman">President Clinton's Executive Order #13073
	states that &quot;The American people expect reliable service from their Government and
	deserve the confidence that&nbsp; critical government functions dependent on electronic
	systems will be performed&nbsp; accurately and in a timely manner. Because of a design
	feature in many electronic systems, a large number of activities in the public and private
	sectors could be at risk beginning in the year 2000. Some computer systems and other
	electronic devices will misinterpret the year '00' as 1900, rather than 2000. Unless
	appropriate action is taken, this flaw, known as the 'Y2K problem', can cause systems that
	support those functions to compute erroneously or simply not run. Minimizing the Y2K
	problem will require a major technological and managerial effort, and it is critical that
	the United States Government does its part in addressing this challenge.&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>

	<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Times New Roman">The order established executive branch policy
	that agencies shall: </font></p>

	<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Times New Roman">(1) assure that no critical Federal program
	experiences disruption because of the Y2K problem; </font></p>

	<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Times New Roman">(2) assist and cooperate with State, local,
	and tribal governments to address the Y2K problem where those governments depend on
	Federal information or information technology, or the Federal Government is dependent on
	those governments to perform critical missions; </font></p>

	<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Times New Roman">(3) cooperate with the private sector
	operators of critical national and local systems, including the banking and financial
	system, the telecommunications system, the public health system, the transportation
	system, and the electric power generation system, in addressing the Y2K problem; and,</font></p>

	<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Times New Roman">(4) communicate with their foreign
	counterparts to raise awareness of and generate cooperative international arrangements to
	address the Y2K problem. </font></p>

	<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Times New Roman">The order further established the <a HREF="http://www.y2k.gov" TARGET="_blank" OnMouseOver="message('Council Web Site'); return true"><strong>President's Council on Year 2000&nbsp; Conversion</strong></a>
	(the &quot;Council&quot;). The Council Chair is an Assistant to the President, and the
	Council is composed of one representative from each of the executive departments and other
	Federal agencies as determined by the Chair. The Chair oversees the activities of agencies
	to assure that their systems operate smoothly through the year 2000; acts as chief
	spokesperson on the Y2K issue for the executive branch in national and international fora;
	provides policy coordination of executive branch activities with State, local, and tribal
	governments on the Y2K problem; and, promotes appropriate Federal roles with respect to
	private sector Y2K activities.</font></p>

	<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Times New Roman">The Council Chair determined that an economic
	sector methodology would be used for discussing the Council's Y2K outreach activities. A
	lead agency was named for each economic sector (e.g., transportation, social services,
	food supply, etc.), with each agency responsible for providing information about the
	sector(s) that it is associated with.</font></p>

	<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Times New Roman">The Department of Transportation was
	designated as the lead agency for the Y2K Transportation Sector which includes the United
	States Postal Service, the Department of Interior, the Department of Treasury (Customs),
	the Department of State, and the Department of Defense as member agencies. </font></p>
