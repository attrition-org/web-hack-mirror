 ? I hear you ask well.. I got pissed at the dumb ass news reporters getting something like a lame ass DOS explaination all wrong. One BBC news reporter even went as far as saying it was a flood of email messages that hit yahoo h0h0h0h. I wish these people would leave the explaining to people in the know. As for those under the impression yahoo have fixed the problem and are not vulnerable anymore think again a concentrated + modified version of stream.c from a few OC3's would drop them again no problem. Expect more of these lame floods until ingress filtering is implemented across the board and all ISP's brought into compliance if IPV6 doesn't fix it nothing will. - BlazinWeed owns you Shouts : Pr0xy , Ep0ch ,Paint , Cybernetix ,Zeroc , WKD ,Herf , Manipulat0r , Datawar , Morbid_Engel , Zenomorph , SolarFlux Rejekt and everyone else i forgot to mention
