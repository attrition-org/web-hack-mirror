<h3><font color="#000080">Digital information at your desks</font></h3>

<p><font color="#000080">Have you ever wished the library could come to you?&nbsp; RIDER,
the DOT Library's <em>Research &amp; Information Databases and Electronic Resources</em>,<em>
</em>commences our effort to make a wide array of&nbsp; electronic information accessible
to you at your desk.&nbsp; Whether you need a corporate profile or an article on new
environmental systems, RIDER can bring access to this information to your fingertips.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Use these links to explore RIDER's elements:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080"><a href="Default.htm">Online Catalog</a><br>
    The DOT Library's Online Catalog contains over 80,000 bibliographic records, with more
    being added each day.&nbsp; You can search or browse the catalog by title, author,
    subject, or a number of other different access points.&nbsp; Search complexity can range
    from simple word searches to more complicated Boolean logic.&nbsp; All catalog records can
    be printed or downloaded to disk.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080"><a href="ncdroms.htm">Research and Reference Databases</a><br>
    RIDER contains a large number of electronic databases, with information formats ranging
    from indexes and abstracts to full-text and page image. For assistance in searching,
    consult the <em>Help </em>menu which is an element of nearly every database, or a member
    of the Library reference staff at 6-0746.&nbsp; <br>

    There will be many more digital special collections to follow.&nbsp; If you have a
    collection of documents you would like digitized, please contact the <a href="mailto:library@tasc.dot.gov">DOT Library</a> to find out how we can assist you.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#000080">Our experienced library reference staff is available to assist
you in locating any information you are not able to access on RIDER.&nbsp; Reference staff
members can help develop and refine searches and search strategies, locate information in
our print collections, and access online services such as Lexis/Nexis, Dun &amp;
Bradstreet, Westlaw, and Dialog.&nbsp; We can provide complete company reports, and full
text articles from over 5000 journals, periodicals, and newspapers. &nbsp; Lastly, if by
chance, our collections do not contain the information or resource you are seeking, we can
access the holdings of over one million libraries through our Inter-Library Loan network.</font></p>

<h3><font color="#000080">Circulation services</font></h3>

<p><font color="#000080">DOT employees may borrow circulating library materials. Books and
reports circulate for four weeks. Back issues of periodicals circulate for two weeks.
Materials in the reference collection may be used in the library only. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">DOT employees will be asked to present their employee ID when
checking out library materials. The ID serves as a library card, with a patron barcode on
the back of the ID used to check out books in the automated library system. Circulation
assistants and reference librarians at all locations will be happy to barcode your ID and
assist you with checking out materials. </font></p>

<h3><font color="#000080">Periodical routing</font></h3>

<p><font color="#000080">The Library routes periodicals to DOT employees upon request.
Please contact a library staff member for further information. </font></p>

<h3><font color="#000080">Acquisition services</font></h3>

<p><font color="#000080">DOT employees may make requests for items to be purchased for the
library collection. Please see a reference librarian. In some cases it may be preferable
to obtain the items through an inter-library loan (see below). </font></p>

<h3><font color="#000080">Inter-library loan</font></h3>

<p><font color="#000080">Inter-library loan is a service provided for DOT employees who
need materials not located in the DOT Library collection. Please see a circulation
assistant or reference librarian if you do not see what you need in the <a href="ncatalog.htm">online catalog</a>, and they will borrow the item from another
library. We can borrow books and reports as well as periodical articles. </font></p>

<h3><font color="#000080">Photocopying</font></h3>

<p><font color="#000080">Library photocopiers may be used for the duplication of
work-related materials. DOT employees may see a reference librarian or circulation
assistant to obtain a pass key.</font></p>
