<p><font color="#000080">The DOT Library is one of the largest transportation libraries in
the United States. The library holds more than 300,000 titles, including over 1200
periodical titles. The library collects materials related to all areas of transportation,
both in print and electronic formats. Each library location has a particular subject
concentration, with the Nassif technical collection being the primary source for materials
concerning general transportation, surface, and water transportation. Special topics
include: bridges, driver</font> <font color="#000080">studies, engineering (emphasis on
civil), highways and highway safety, history of transportation, land utilization, marine
engineering, mass transit, merchant marine, navigation (except air), oceanography,
pipelines, railroads, ships and shipbuilding, statistics, traffic engineering, traffic
surveys and forecasts, urban transportation, and waterways. The FAA technical collection
contains materials covering the areas of general aviation, aviation safety, airports,
airport access, human factors in aviation, aviation medicine, and selected materials in
supporting sciences such as navigation, aerospace, and engineering. </font></p>
