<font color="#000080">[T]he Act which I sign today is the most important transportation
legislation of our lifetime ... It is one of the essential building blocks in our
preparation for the future ... Transportation has truly emerged as a significant part of
our national life.&nbsp; As a basic force in our society, its progress must be accelerated
so that the quality of our life can be improved.</font></p>

is about more than concrete, asphalt, and steel -- it's about people. &nbsp; It's about
giving people the means to get to their jobs safely and efficiently. &nbsp; It's about
giving US businesses the competitive edge they need to compete and win in today's global
economy.&nbsp; And it's about giving the transportation industry -- management and labor
-- some of the highest paying jobs in our economy.&nbsp; Yes, this is what transportation
is all about -- providing opportunity.<br>
