<P><FONT SIZE=+1>THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST INDIES</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The British Virgin Islands contributes to the recurrent
budget of the University of the West Indies and is represented on the University
Council by the Minister of Health, Education and Welfare.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The University of the West Indies School of Continuing
Studies (BVI) is currently housed in facilities rented by the H. Lavity
Stoutt Community College in the heart of Road Town and which serve both
as an annex of the Community College and as the University Centre. There
is close collaboration between the H. L. Stoutt Community College and the
University Centre in the development and delivery of various programmes,
for example, the Legal Studies programme and the Teacher Education programme,
noted elsewhere in this catalogue. This collaborative relationship between
the Community College and the regional university serves to enhance tertiary
education in the British Virgin Islands and to encourage and assist those
BVI students who plan to enter the University of the West Indies.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>HOCKING COLLEGE, OHIO</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Through the facilitative efforts of a Virgin Islander
(Mr. E. Wilburn Smith) on the administration of Hocking College in Nelsonville,
Ohio, the H. Lavity Stoutt Community College and Hocking College entered
into an “Articulation, Training, and Transfer of Credit Agreement” in 1992.
As a result of this Agreement, Hocking College and the H. Lavity Stoutt
Community College have collaborated in a number of areas, most significantly
in delivery of a nursing programme. Hocking College is a fully accredited
two-year institution and is well-regarded for its technological programmes,
perhaps most notably, its programme in ceramic technology.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>UNIVERSITY OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Credits are currently transferable to the University of
the Virgin Islands in a number of programme areas and discussions continue
between the two institutions regarding further articulation arrangements
with respect to the transfer of credits.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A collaborative relationship between the H. Lavity Stoutt
Community College and Wright State University of Ohio has been developed.
A significant result of this relationship has been the opportunity for
residents of the territory to pursue post-graduate education without having
to leave the BVI through Masters in Education (M.Ed.) and Masters in Business
Administration (MBA) programmes being offered in the British Virgin Islands
by Wright State University through the Community College. Articulation
arrangements between the two institutions with respect to the transfer
of course credits are being explored.</FONT>
