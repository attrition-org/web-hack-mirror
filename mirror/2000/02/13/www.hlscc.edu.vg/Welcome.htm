<P><B><FONT FACE="Rockwell">The H. Lavity Stoutt Community College is dedicated
to providing varied educational opportunities for British Virgin Islanders
to learn more about themselves and to help to develop a national identity
that respects all persons regardless of nationality, ethnicity, race, gender
or religion; and to assist all students to achieve maximum educational
growth. The thrust of this institution, therefore, transcends an immersion
in the accumulated experiences of humankind as represented in the variety
of instructional/learning resources which are available to our students.
This institution is a symbol of national unity, a beacon of national growth,
a medium through which the present may translate the past to shape the
future, and a flag bearer for the preservation of British Virgin Islands
cultural heritage.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Rockwell">In order to ensure that these objectives are
achieved and sustained, the refining education fire of the next five years,
indeed the future, must burn the dross of nonchalance and mediocrity and
forge the spirit of cooperation, caring, and scholarship commensurate with
our mission.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Rockwell">As you peruse this catalogue I would like you
to reflect on these sentiments and remember that I am here along with a
team of dedicated faculty and staff to guide you in your educational pursuits.
Always feel free to seek that guidance whenever you need it.</FONT></B>

<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Rockwell">It is a pleasure to welcome you to the
H. Lavity Stoutt Community College.</FONT></B></CENTER>
<B><FONT FACE="Rockwell">Although still a young institution, the College
has exhibited dramatic development, both in terms of its student body and
the academic programmes being offered. The pages of this edition of the
College’s catalogue reflect this continued development, with a number of
programmes appearing for the first time. The associate degree programme
in Corporate and Trust Administration, built around the curriculum of the
British Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, is but one
of these. That the College’s reputation and creditability is of a high
order is reflected in its having been designated a regional centre of specialization
in applied marine studies under the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States
Education Reform Strategy.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Rockwell">We are proud of the College’s recent accomplishments
and we are pleased that you have chosen to join us.</FONT></B>
