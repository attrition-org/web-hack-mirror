<p align="left"><strong>Hello and greetings from <a href="mailto:%22team-echo@usa.net%22">Team-Echo</a>.
&nbsp; This is going to be a bit of a long one, but you'll understand why.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>This is about Elian Gonzales....I'm sure everyone is tired of
hearing about him, but it's the principle of the issue.&nbsp; He doesn't belong in the
United States of America.&nbsp; He belongs in Cuba, with his family who actually loves
him.&nbsp; Instead, he is stuck with some self-imposed &quot;exiles&quot; who flaunt him
like some sort of banner or poster, they shower him with gifts and tell him how evil Cuba
and it's government is.&nbsp; The boy is going to be a major head case if this keeps up.
&nbsp; And God forbid he be granted citizenship in the US, he'll be forgotten in a week
and he'll learn that his so-called &quot;family&quot; really doesn't love him, but rather
that he was just being used in their political game in Miami (a.k.a. Little Cuba).
&nbsp; Not only are his family involved, but so are the Church, which has no place in the
issue at all, and the State of Florida, which stuck it's nose in because the just want the
Latino vote and nothing more.&nbsp; Both of these groups could also care less about the
little boy.&nbsp; He belongs with his father in Cuba, where he will get the love and life
he deserves, not be used as a rally call and then be discarded after the
&quot;battle&quot; is over.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Therefore I ask that those with the authority to send him home
(yes, INS, I am talking to you....) that they do so quickly before Elian suffers anymore
mental trauma then he already has.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong><big><u><em>Shouts:</em></u></big> BusDr1v3r, Bansh33, Analognet,
sh00tR, Zenomorph, Sys-Edit, himi, The Black Priest, Fuck Shit Up, Political Genocide,
Nocx, Digital Domination,.....ummmm, fuck it, u all know who u r!!!!&nbsp; If I forgot,
I'm sorry.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong><big><u><em>Fu-Q's:</em></u></big> The self-imposed
&quot;exiles&quot; who claim to love Elian Gonzales, if you loved him, you'd send him
home.</strong></p>
