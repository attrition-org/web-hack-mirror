Hacked by aKt0r! Y0! wuzzup webadmin dude ? You guys have to take desperate security measures. You know that you are an ISP and that it is very dangerous to play with weak security. I could have done much more, worse dammage. Like get customer information , deface the other v-hosts on your boxes. But hey! I have no bad intentions. Not at all. Just teaching you a lesson, thats all. My skill is the best! Seriously guys...security is crucial. Have phun and take care...Shouts goes out to the b10zcrew. Fanmail goes to haxisrs@usa.net Webmaster dude..feel free to mail me. Dont be embarrased, get over it and face it that j00 were lame.
