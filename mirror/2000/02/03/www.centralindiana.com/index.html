<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Team-Echo.&nbsp; And today's rant is about
Elian Gonzales.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This young boy should be sent home.&nbsp; He is being
brainwashed and mistreated by his so-called &quot;loving&quot; relatives who are
&quot;looking out for his best interest.&nbsp; However, the self-imposed
&quot;exiles&quot; from Cuba are only using him as a banner to wave at Fidel Castro and
the Cuban people for their own gain.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy belongs at home with his father, his REAL
family.&nbsp; But instead, he is becoming a basket case.&nbsp; He will have mental
problems for years to come because of the way he is being used.&nbsp; He is being showered
with gifts, but, if he is granted US citizenship, he will be forgotten after the
&quot;exiles&quot; hail their victory over Castro and the Cuban government.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you people really love that little boy, set him
free.&nbsp; Send him home to his family where he can live a somewhat normal life!
&nbsp; Don't use him for your political games!</p>
