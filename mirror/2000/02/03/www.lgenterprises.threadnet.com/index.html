Ok. I know people are gonna complain cause we hacked a frontpage server and call us "lame" and 
"script kiddies". Well the thing is, frontpage was once alright to deface. When Vaccum first released his document on NT sploits, no one paid much care to the frontpage section and used net use:\\ and so forth. But when the kiddies started calling themselves "elite" for hacking frontpage, thats when everyone started to get pissed off.
Well lemme tell u something. We don't think we are elite nor are we. We learn just as u guys do everyday. We try to get ahead of the msadc kiddies and try to learn new ways of exploiting/patching systems. What's so wrong with that? Isn't that what we are trying to accomplish anyways? -->
