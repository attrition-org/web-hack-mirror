<p>Your network is a little hacked. </p>

<p>it's so easy...., and it shouldn't be.</p>

<p>Admin, if you don't know why your network is insecure, mail me
at rat112@freemail.nl and I will explain. </p>

<p>don't worry about your system and data, I did nothing with it
( only deleted some logs ), and I did not deface all the other
sites you host.</p>
