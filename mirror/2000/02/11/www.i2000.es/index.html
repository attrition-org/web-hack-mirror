<p>this one's for janet reno.. you made a threat to us, now let's
see you back it up. the media doesn't know it's head from it's
ass when it talks about the mass of denial of service attacks
which occured this past week. 'hacking' has nothing to do with
packeting. the media is confused and lead to believe that what
happened to all those sites (yahoo, ebay, etc..) was so HUGE
event. It wasn't. It was a little script kid sitting behind his
computer with a d.o.s. tool. anyways.. shouts the scene..</p>
