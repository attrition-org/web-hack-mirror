<p align="center">If you kill one it's a tragedy, if you kill a million, it's a
statistic.</p>

<p align="center">Admin: mail me and I'll tell you what's wrong</p>

<p align="center">I think you need to go to the toilet, because you talk more
shit then a five tonner taking a crap chap.</p>

<p align="center">Bastard&nbsp;<br>
Mother fucker,<br>
bastard.&nbsp;<br>
Townie scum.<br>
Swarm smile,<br>
First class prick.&nbsp;<br>
I see in his eyes,<br>
he doesn't give a fuck.&nbsp;<br>
How can he love someone else,&nbsp;<br>
He loves himself too much.<br>
His boyish charms,<br>
are but skin deep,&nbsp;<br>
he's gonna fuckin' hurt her,&nbsp;<br>
make her weep.&nbsp;<br>
He doesn't deserve her,&nbsp;<br>
he'd screw her up,&nbsp;<br>
Why can't she see this?&nbsp;<br>
Just another fuck-up.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Talkin' 'Bout My Generation<br>
My generation has mounds of technology at its finger tips,&nbsp;<br>
but most choose not to use it.<br>
My generation is plagued with fifteen year old pregnant girls,<br>
but just shrug,&nbsp;<br>
"serves them right."&nbsp;<br>
My generation has a drug dealer for each street corner,<br>
but thats just life in the 90's.<br>
My generation has facist dictators as role modals for young kids,<br>
but everone wants the power to be heard.&nbsp;<br>
My generation subjects its population to streaming TV violence,<br>
but thats just hollywood entertainment.&nbsp;<br>
My generation slowly tries to destroy its own plannet,<br>
but we won't be here when it happens.&nbsp;<br>
My generation seems determined to kill itself with tobbacco,<br>
alcohol,<br>
drugs,<br>
nuclear wepons,<br>
biochemicals<br>
and homisidal maniacs.<br>
But hey,<br>
"That's just the way it is."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Let me Breathe<br>
Every day,&nbsp;<br>
Pressure.&nbsp;<br>
Living in their shadow,&nbsp;<br>
Up to their expectations.&nbsp;<br>
No doors close,<br>
And none open.<br>
Just a continuous hallway of shit.<br>
Don’t give me your money,<br>
I don’t want it anymore.&nbsp;<br>
Don’t make me feel guilty,&nbsp;<br>
I can’t handle it anymore.<br>
Just let me fucking breathe! </p>
