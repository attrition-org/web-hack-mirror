shit then a five tonner taking a crap chap.</p>

<p align="center">Soul Mates<br>
Our understanding makes us powerful.<br>
Our knowledge keeps us sane.&nbsp;<br>
Our inteligence makes converstaion.&nbsp;<br>
Our similarities raise a smile.<br>
Our differences make our friendship stronger.<br>
Our views educate us in an un-literary world.<br>
Our honesty stengthens our trust.<br>
Our individuality makes us unique.<br>
My friend,&nbsp;<br>
my soul mate,<br>
Forever.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Nocturnal<br>
Complimentry moonlight,<br>
fuels the soul.&nbsp;<br>
The world is still now,&nbsp;<br>
and I am alone.&nbsp;<br>
The townies have staggered home,<br>
the murderers and rapests have called it a night.&nbsp;<br>
Just me alone,&nbsp;<br>
in a time with little light.<br>
No one to mock,&nbsp;<br>
no one to stare,&nbsp;<br>
a quiet,<br>
peacful world,&nbsp;<br>
where I couldn't care&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Looking down a pint glass&nbsp;<br>
One more drink,<br>
just to ease the pain.<br>
So I can be at ease again,&nbsp;<br>
and keep myself sane.<br>
It's attractivness can be sweet,<br>
can be bitter,&nbsp;<br>
or be neat.&nbsp;<br>
But for me is much more,<br>
than the occaisional treat.<br>
One more drink, just to ease the pain.&nbsp;<br>
Keep my mind ticking,&nbsp;<br>
and take away the blame.&nbsp;<br>
It's kick can be powerful,&nbsp;<br>
or subtle all the same,&nbsp;<br>
but still fuels emotions,&nbsp;<br>
still breaks away the chains.&nbsp;<br>
One more drink,<br>
just to ease the pain.<br>
Then I can go home now,&nbsp;<br>
and live with the shame.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Opposites Attract<br>
I am I.<br>
She is she.&nbsp;<br>
Two opposites.<br>
But the forces of attraction break these barriers free.&nbsp;<br>
For who,&nbsp;<br>
In a world full of clones,&nbsp;<br>
could be attracted to their mirror image?&nbsp;<br>
Not me.<br>
For I am I,<br>
and she is she. </p>
