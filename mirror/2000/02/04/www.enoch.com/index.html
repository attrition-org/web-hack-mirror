                  Russian security chief asks media's<BR>
                  help in Chechen war<BR><BR>

                  MOSCOW (AP) -- The secretary of Russia's Security Council has called on the media<BR>
                  to join the government's efforts to defeat Chechen rebels and not to allow militants<BR><BR>
                  any airtime. 

                  In an interview published Thursday in the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, Security<BR>
                  Council Secretary Sergei Ivanov claimed he was not "encroaching on the freedom of<BR>
                  speech, but there must be limits and a precise understanding of what can and cannot<BR><BR>
                  be done." 

                  "Use Chechen informers if you want. Just don't put<BR>
                  terrorists on the air," he was quoted as saying. <BR><BR><BR><BR>

<BR>
If you deny the right to media attention<BR>
you are also helping to hide the war crimes<BR>
that are being commited by russia.<BR>
<BR>
Freedom of information.<BR>
Isnt that what we are about?<BR>
<BR>
When LOU declared war on China's infrastructure<BR>
a good portion of the hacker culture put the effort<BR>
down on the grounds that shutting down the information<BR>
flow of any country would be a violation of ethics.<BR>
<BR>
Is this different?<BR>
<BR>
If we deny media attention. We do open the portal for<BR>
the verified civilian killings by Russian to continue<BR>
with even less notice from the general public.<BR>
<BR>
We know that unless there is heavy public push to<BR>
get involved in this and put a stop to the Russian<BR>
slaughter-fest our government will not get involved.<BR>
<BR>
Why?<BR>
<BR>
Because we are too ph33rful of stepping on somebodies<BR>
little toes. Why? Pure political tip-toeing.<BR>
<BR>
So damnit, do something about it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Or are you scared too?<BR>
<BR>
Oh yeah, before I forget.<BR>

P.S. Rename oldindex.htm to index.htm to fix your site<BR>
I do honestly apologize for this outrage.<BR>
<BR>
It would be pointless to try to track me down<BR>
and cost much more then the 10 seconds of work<BR>
you will need to do to rename the file.<BR>
<BR>
Please understand that I use this as a means of<BR>
getting a political message out<BR>
<BR>
And I have patched the hole that I used to gain<BR>
entry to your system in return for the headache.<BR>
<BR>
I did not view, or damage any of your data<BR>
And the only other data that I have edited<BR>
was your log file. You understand why.<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and btw, this is the sloppiest HTML I have ever done.<BR>
