This is Who We are
<p>This one goes out to all of the power hungry bastards who call
<p>themselves “authority”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“This is Who We are”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This is who We are, this is what We do...
<p>Believe it when We say, “We are not going to live for you.”
<p>Sorry, but we won’t sit and worship your God every single day...
<p>This is who we are, this is how we’ll stay.
<p>When are you going to finally realize?
<p>we are not going to live for you and your stupid fucked up lies.
<p>This is who We are, this is who we’ll be...
<p>When are you going to finally see?
<p>You can preach to me every day and night...
<p>But this is who We are and we know that we are right.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This is who We are, this is what We do...
<p>Believe it when we say, “we are not going to change for you.”
<p>Sorry, but we won’t sit here and let our life rot away...
<p>This is who we are, this is how we’ll stay.
<p>When are you going to finally know?
<p>This is who we are, it ain’t a fucking show!
<p>Now we’ve found ourselves and we know you don’t agree...
<p>But this is who we are and this is who weI’ll be.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This is who We are and we know that we are&nbsp; right...
<p>Believe me when we say, “we do not want to fight.”
<p>Sorry, but now we’ve found our way...
<p>This is who we are, this is how we’ll stay.
<p>When are you going to finally notice?
<p>we’ve found ourserlves and it is this.
<p>This is who we are, this is who we’ll be...
<p>we are not living for you, we are living for us.
