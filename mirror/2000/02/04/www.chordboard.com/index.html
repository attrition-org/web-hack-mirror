P.S. Rename oldindex.htm to index.htm to fix your site<BR>
I do honestly apologize for this outrage.<BR>
<BR>
It would be pointless to try to track me down<BR>
and cost much more then the 10 seconds of work<BR>
you will need to do to rename the file.<BR>
<BR>
Please understand that I use this as a means of<BR>
getting a political message out<BR>
<BR>
And I have patched the hole that I used to gain<BR>
entry to your system in return for the headache.<BR>
<BR>
I did not view, or damage any of your data<BR>
And the only other data that I have edited<BR>
was your log file. You understand why.<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and btw, this is the sloppiest HTML I have ever done.<BR>
