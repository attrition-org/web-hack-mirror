<h2 align="center">Contributing to<br>
            The Apache Software Foundation</h2>

    <p>
    As a volunteer-based organization, the Apache Software Foundation
    stands most in need of dedicated volunteers who can work on software,
    documentation, or administrative issues within each of the
    <a href="projects.html">ASF projects</a>, including the Foundation
    project itself.  Other ways to contribute include providing services
    or equipment for use by the Foundation, or
    <a href="#how-to-donate">donating money to the Foundation</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    In terms of software developers, there is typically a large need
    for people willing to test the various pieces of software, in various
    environments, and to track, reproduce, isolate, and fix problems
    reported by the user community.  Speaking of which, we consider the
    reporting of problems to our tracking systems to be a valuable
    contribution as well.  Directions for how you can contribute in
    these ways can be found in each of the <a href="projects.html">project
    websites</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Apache Software Foundation is also looking for new or existing
    collaborative software development projects that are in need of a home.
    This includes both projects related and unrelated to the existing
    ASF projects.
    </p>
    <p>
    Not a software developer?  Don't worry, there are plenty of other ways
    you can contribute.  Our customers, the users of our free software
    products, are part of the Apache community as well.  Organizing
    local user groups, volunteering to work on user conferences, and
    helping less experienced users on the various on-line forums are all
    ways in which you can contribute to the ASF projects.  Likewise, the
    Foundation project can often benefit from people with administrative
    experience or access to specialized communication facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you wish to provide equipment for use by the Foundation, please
    <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> before attempting to send it
    "here" directly -- the nature of our virtual enterprise is such that
    the equipment and services used to support our projects are located
    all over the world.
    </p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="how-to-donate">Donating money to the ASF</a></h2>

    <p>
    Individuals and companies can now donate funds to support the
    Foundation and its projects.  You can do so by sending a check or
    money order, payable to "The Apache Software Foundation", directly
    to our Treasurer at
    <pre>
     The Apache Software Foundation
     <sup>c</sup>/o Covalent Technologies, Inc.
     1200 'N' Street, Suite 112
     Lincoln, NE   68508
     USA
    </pre>
    Please include the name under which you wish the donation to be credited,
    either your own or the third-party if it is a gift on behalf of someone
    else, and an e-mail address to which we can acknowledge receipt.  This
    information will not be used for any other purpose.
    We will send a physical receipt by normal mail for any donations
    of US$100 or more, provided you include a return address.
    </p>
    <p>
    We are currently working on a process for making donations easier
    through the use of a secure server for credit card transactions.
    </p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="tax-status">ASF Not-for-profit vs.
                                        Nonprofit Status</a></h2>

    <p>
    The Apache Software Foundation is a private operating foundation
    that is not yet registered as a nonprofit or charitable organization
    under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.  This means
    that, for individuals within the U.S., donations to the ASF are
    <em>not</em> tax-deductible.  However, donations can potentially be
    treated by companies as a business expense, as part of the cost of
    doing business, provided that the business benefits by the continued
    existence of one or more of the ASF projects.  We are not accountants,
    so this should not be trusted as financial advice of any kind, but
    hopefully this description will be useful to those who advise you in
    these matters.
    </p>
