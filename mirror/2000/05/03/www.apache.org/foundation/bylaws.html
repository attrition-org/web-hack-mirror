</H1>

<H2>ARTICLE I</H2>

<H3>Business Offices</H3>

<P>The corporation shall have such offices either within or outside the
State of Delaware and within or outside the United States, as the
Board of Directors may from time to time determine or as the business
of the corporation may require.
</P>

<H2>ARTICLE II</H2>

<H3>Registered Offices and Registered Agents</H3>

<P><STRONG>Section 2.1.  Delaware.</STRONG>  The address of the initial
registered office
in the State of Delaware and the name of the initial registered agent
of the corporation at such address are set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation. The corporation may, from time to time, designate a
different address as its registered office or a different person as
its registered agent, or both; provided, however, that such
designation shall become effective upon the filing of a statement of
such change with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as is
required by law.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 2.2.  Other States.</STRONG> In the event the
corporation desires to
qualify to do business in one or more states other than Delaware, the
corporation shall designate the location of the registered office in
each such state and designate the registered agent for service of
process at such address in the manner provided by the law of the state
in which the corporation elects to be qualified.
</P>

<H2>ARTICLE III</H2>

<H3>Meetings of Members</H3>

<P><STRONG>Section 3.1.  Place of Meetings.</STRONG>  Meetings of the
members shall be
held at the principal office of the corporation or any other place
(within or outside the State of Delaware and within or outside the
United States) designated in the notice of the meeting.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 3.2.  Annual Meeting.</STRONG> A meeting of the
members shall be held
annually at such time as the Board of Directors may determine (which
shall be, in the case of the first annual meeting, not more than
thirteen (13) months after the organization of the corporation and, in
the case of all other meetings, not more than thirteen (13) months
after the date of the last annual meeting), at which annual meeting
the members shall elect a Board of Directors and transact other proper
business.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 3.3.  Special Meetings.</STRONG> Special meetings
of the members shall
be held when directed by the Chairman, President or the Board of
Directors, or when requested in writing by not less than ten percent
(10%) of all members entitled to vote at the meeting.  The call for the
meeting shall be issued by the Secretary, unless the Chairman,
President, Board of Directors or members requesting the meeting shall
designate another person to do so.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 3.4.  Notice.</STRONG> Written notice stating
the place, date and hour
of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less
than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the
meeting, either personally or by first class mail, by or at the
direction of the Chairman, President, the Secretary, or the officer or
persons calling the meeting, to each member of record entitled to vote
at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be
delivered when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the
member at his or her address as it appears in the membership records
of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid.
</P>

<P>Notwithstanding the above paragraph, the corporation shall not be
required to give notice of a members' meeting to any member to whom
notice of two consecutive annual meetings, and all notices of meetings
or of the taking of action by written consent without a meeting to
such member during the period between such two consecutive annual
meetings, have been mailed under the procedures outlined above and
have been returned undeliverable. Any action or meeting which shall be
taken or held without notice to such member shall have the same force
and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such member
delivers to the corporation a written notice setting forth his or her
then current address, the requirement that notice be given to such
member shall be reinstated.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 3.5.  Notice of Adjourned Meetings.</STRONG> When a
meeting is
adjourned to another time or place, the corporation shall not be
required to give any notice of the adjourned meeting if the time and
place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting
at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, any
business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the
original meeting. If, however, the adjournment is for more than thirty
(30) days, or if after the adjournment the Board of Directors fixes a
new record date for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned
meeting shall be given as provided in Section 3.4 above, to each
member of record on the new record date entitled to vote at such
meeting.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 3.6.  Waiver of Notice.</STRONG>  Whenever notice
is required to be
given to any member, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person
or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time
stated therein, shall be the equivalent to the giving of such
notice. Attendance by a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver
of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting
for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting,
to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the
purpose of any regular or special meeting of the members need be
specified in the written waiver of notice.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 3.7.  Fixing Record Date.</STRONG>
</P>

<P>(a) For the purpose of determining members entitled to notice of or
to vote at any meeting of members or any adjournment thereof, the
Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be
more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If
no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for
determining members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
members shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held. A determination of members of record entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of members shall apply to any
adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

<P>(b) For purposes of determining the members entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days
after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by
the Board of Directors, the record date for determining members
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting,
when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by the
General Corporation Laws of the State of Delaware, shall be the first
date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken
or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to
its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of
business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of
the books in which proceedings of meetings of members are recorded.
Delivery made to a corporation's registered office shall be by hand or
by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no
record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action
by the Board of Directors is required by the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware, the record date for determining members
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting
shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
</P>

<P>(c) For purposes of determining the members entitled to exercise any
rights, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted,
and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such
action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining
members for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating
thereto.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 3.8.  Record of Members Having Voting Rights.</STRONG>
The officer or
agent having charge of the membership records of the corporation shall
prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before each meeting of
members, a complete list of the members entitled to vote at such
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the name,
address, telephone number, facsimile number and electronic mail
address of each member. For a period of ten (10) days prior to such
meeting, the list shall be open to the examination of any member, for
any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours,
either at a place within the city where such meeting is to be held,
which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not
so specified, at the place where such meeting is to be held. The list
shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place of the
meeting and shall be subject to inspection by any member at any time
during the meeting. Upon the willful neglect or refusal of the
directors to produce such a list at any meeting for the election of
directors, such directors shall be ineligible for election to any
office at such meeting.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 3.9.  Member Quorum.</STRONG>  Except as otherwise
required by law, by
the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, one-third (1/3)
of the members entitled to vote, represented in person or represented
by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of members. When a
specified item of business is required to be voted on by a class of
members (if the members are divided into classes), one third (1/3) of
such class of members, represented in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of such item of business
by that class of members. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote
of a majority of the members represented at the meeting and entitled
to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the members, unless
the vote of a greater number or voting by class is required by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or by the Certificate
of Incorporation or by these Bylaws. The directors shall be elected by
a plurality of the votes of the members present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
election of directors. Where a separate vote by class of members is
required, the affirmative vote of a plurality of members of such class
represented at the meeting shall be the act of such class unless the
vote of a greater number is required by the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws.
</P>

<P>After a quorum has been established at a members' meeting, the
subsequent withdrawal of members, so as to reduce the number of
members in person or represented by proxy entitled to vote at the
meeting below the number required for a quorum, shall not affect the
validity of any action taken at the meeting or any adjournment
thereof.
</P>

<P>After a quorum has been established at a members' meeting, the
subsequent admission of new members, so as to increase the number of
members required for a quorum above the number of members present in
person or represented by proxy entitled to vote at the meeting, shall
not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting or any
adjournment thereof.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 3.10. Voting.</STRONG> Each member
(except emeritus members) shall be
entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting
of the members, except as may otherwise be provided in the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
</P>

<P>A member may vote either in person or by proxy executed in writing by
the member or his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 3.11. Proxies.</STRONG> Every member entitled to
vote at a meeting of
members or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, or a member's duly authorized
attorney-in-fact, may authorize another person or persons to act for
him/her by proxy.
</P>

<P>Every proxy must be signed by the member or his or her
attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be valid after three (3) years from
its date, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. All proxies shall be
revocable.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 3.12. Action by Members Without a Meeting.</STRONG>
Any action
required to be taken or which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of members of the corporation, may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a written consent setting
forth the action so taken shall be signed by members having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize
or take such action at a meeting at which all members entitled to vote
thereon were present and voted; provided, however, that no written
consent shall be effective unless such consent (i) bears the date of
signature by each member signing such consent and (ii) is delivered to
the corporation within sixty (60) days of the date on which the
earliest consent was delivered to the corporation.  Prompt notice of
the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than
unanimous written consent shall be given to those members who have not
consented in writing.

such Board or of any committee designated by such Board by conference
telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all
persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same

at a meeting.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 5.12. Action Without a Meeting.</STRONG> Any action
required or

association or other organization in which one or more of the
directors of the corporation are directors or officers or are
financially interested, shall be void or voidable solely because of
such relationship or interest or solely because such director or
directors are present at or participate in the meeting of the Board of
Directors or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or
ratifies such contract or transaction or solely because his or her or
their votes are counted for such purpose, if:

amendment or repeal, which notice may be by electronic means.
</P>

<H2>ARTICLE XII</H2>

<H3>Indemnification of Officers and Directors</H3>

<P><STRONG>Section 12.1. Right to Indemnification.</STRONG>  Each person
who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the
right of the corporation), by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was a director, officer or member of the corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, or other enterprise, shall be entitled to indemnification
against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and
amounts paid in settlement to the fullest extent now or hereafter
permitted by applicable law as long as such person acted in good faith
and in a manner that such person reasonably believed to be in or not
be opposed to the best interests of the corporation; provided,
however, that the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnity in connection with an action, suit or proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person only if such action, suit or
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 12.2. Advance Payment of Expenses.</STRONG>
Expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by any person who is or was an
officer, director or member of the corporation, or who is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as an officer or director of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative action, suit or proceeding, shall be paid by the
corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit
or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
person to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that he or
she is not entitled under applicable law to be indemnified by the
corporation.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 12.3. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit.</STRONG>
If a claim under this
Article is not paid in full by the corporation within ninety (90) days
after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the
claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation
to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole
or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action
(other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred
in defending any action or proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the
corporation unless such action is based on the claimant having
committed an act involving moral turpitude) that the claimant has not
met the standards of conduct which make indemnification permissible
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, but the
burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither
the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its members) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because
he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual
determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its members) that the claimant has not
met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the
action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the
applicable standard of conduct.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 12.4. Contract Rights.</STRONG> The provisions
of this Article shall
be a contract between the corporation and each director, officer or
member to which this Article applies.  No repeal or modification of
these Bylaws shall invalidate or detract from any right or obligation
with respect to any state of facts existing prior to the time of such
repeal or modification.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 12.5. Rights Non-exclusive.</STRONG> The
indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this
Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of members or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 12.6. Insurance.</STRONG> The corporation may
purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer,
member, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at
the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and
incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or
her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the
power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the
provisions of this Article or of applicable law.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 12.7. Definitions.</STRONG> For purposes of
this Article, references
to "the corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of
a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its
separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority
to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that
any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Article with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would
have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate
existence had continued, and references to "other enterprises" shall
include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include
any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee
benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the
corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or
involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with
respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or
beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he
or she reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants
and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have
acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation" as referred to in this Article.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Section 12.8. Continued Coverage.</STRONG> The indemnification
and advancement
of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to this Article shall,
unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to
a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or member and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such person.

executions may be transmitted to the corporation and/or the other
directors and/or members by facsimile and such facsimile execution
