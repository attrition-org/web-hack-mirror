   <p>The Apache Software Foundation is a membership-based, not-for-profit
      corporation.  Individuals who have demonstrated a commitment to
      collaborative open-source software development, through sustained
      participation and contributions within the Foundation's projects,
      are eligible for membership in the ASF.  An individual is awarded
      membership after nomination and approval by a majority of the
      existing <a href="members.html">ASF members</a>.  Thus, the ASF
      is governed by the community it most directly serves -- the people
      collaborating within its projects.
   </p>
   <p>The <a href="members.html">ASF members</a> periodically elect a
      <a href="board/">Board of Directors</a> to manage the organizational
      affairs of the Foundation, as accorded by the
      <a href="bylaws.html">ASF Bylaws</a>.  The Board, in turn, appoints
      a number of officers to oversee the day-to-day operations of the
      Foundation.

   <p>The Foundation is a collaborative project of the ASF. Our goal is
      to build and sustain the literal foundation upon which our open-source
      software projects are based. Like the other projects, we will need
      help to achieve this goal, and several groups have already
      <a href="credits.html">contributed their time and effort</a> to
      good effect.  However, it is often difficult to find volunteers
      to perform the essential grunge work behind the scenes.  We are in
      the process of putting together a support organization, using funds
      <a href="contributing.html">contributed</a> by the Apache community,
      that will provide the administrative assistance needed to keep the
      projects moving at full steam.
