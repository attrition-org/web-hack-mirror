<p align="justify">
<a name="1"></a>1. <b>Does REV-ER-UP really increase horsepower and torque?</b> 
<p align="justify">
- - Yes! Less friction...More power. Some vehicles dyno tested as much as 33 additional horsepower. Also, with less friction you will see an improvement of up to 20% in your fuel economy. Just wait
till you feel your added torque!
<p align="justify">
<a name="2"></a>2. <b>Can I use REV-ER-UP in my old engine?</b> 
<p align="justify">
- Yes, REV-ER-UP is very effective in rejuvenating old engines and will significantly reduce hydrocarbon emissions.
<p align="justify">
<a name="3"></a>3. <b>Can I use REV-ER-UP in my new engine?</b> 
<p align="justify">
- Yes, Fifty percent of all engine wear occurs during the break-in period. The sooner REV-ER-UP is added to the engine the less engine wear that will be incurred.
<p align="justify">
<a name="4"></a>4. <b>How long will REV-ER-UP last?</b> 
<p align="justify">
- REV-ER-UP forms a covalent bond between the metal parts and the molybdenum ions. The treatment is permanent; however, for maximum performance and friction reduction we recommend you treat the engine every 3 years.
<p align="justify">
<a name="5"></a>5. <b>Can the REV-ER-UP bond be broken from metal parts in my engine? </b>
<p align="justify">
- No. The film is permanent and can only be removed by abrasive activity. Since new petroleum based motor oils are allowed to have up to 40,000 PPM of particulate contaminates, the use of synthetic oils would extend the life of the REV-ER-UP surface. The only other source of abrasions is the normal dust particles, which can contain hard silicates that come in through the air filter and are very abrasive. Only extraneous circumstances can remove the REV-ER-UP film over time. Remember REV-ER-UP is covalently bonded to metals.
<p align="justify">
<a name="6"></a>6. <b>How long does it take before I feel the benefits?</b>
<p align="justify">
Within at least 30 minutes. Usually a decrease in engine noise is noted while the REV-ER-UP is being added to the oil. RPMs will increase, and
when driving a noticeable increase in horsepower is felt. Mileage will continue to improve slightly for at least four fill-ups.
<p align="justify">
7<a name="7"></a>. <b>There must be at least 20 oil additives, which claim to reduce friction, increase horsepower, and last for 50,000 miles. Why? </b>
<p align="justify">
- All of those products are stretching the truth. The EPA will not allow any oil additive to be used in calculating Miles Per Gallon in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) ratings simply because any effect is immediately lost when the oil is changed. Claims to last 50,000 miles are spurious, and no scientific documentation has even been offered to back up these claims by any of the oil additive purveyors. REV-ER-UP is in a class by itself - there is no competitive product, which will form a covalent bond between metals in the engine. REV-ER-UP is proven to reduce the coefficient of friction by up to 87.5%. In other words, REV-ER-UP reduces your engine's power robbing friction, which translates into power you can feel.
<p align="justify">
<a name="8"></a>8. <b>Will the use of REV-ER-UP affect my new car warranty?</b> 
<p align="justify">
- Automotive manufacturers do not specify what type of oil to use and don't have a policy on oil additives. Their warranty does require that the oil be changed at the recommended regular internals. Since REV-ER-UP is only applied to the engine parts and is not an oil additive the manufacturers warranty should remain in full force and effect. If you maintain your vehicle in accordance with the manufacturer's suggested lubrication program, then the manufacturer's warranty is in full force and effect.
<p align="justify">
<a name="9"></a>9. <b>How do I install REV-ER-UP?</b> 
<p align="justify">
- Installation is easy and can be done by your self. Please use these instructions to apply REV-ER-UP. They will appear on the new label soon. Each of these steps are important!
<p align="justify">
1. Change oil and filter! Remove dipstick and look at the color of the fresh oil.
<p align="justify">
2. Make sure the contents of the REV-ER-UP bottle is above 70° F! Warm if necessary. Shake the warm bottle well!
<p align="justify">
3. Pour into a warm engine (not hot!). Drain bottle well. Best scenario is warm engine and fresh, oil.
<p align="justify">
4. Start engine immediately and drive for 30 minutes. Keep the engine as cool as possible, as long as possible. After 500 miles, check the oil!
<p align="justify">
6. You may wish to change the oil filter and oil if it appears excessively dirty.
<p align="justify">
<a name="10"></a>10. <b>Will I experience anything unusual with my engine?</b>
<p align="justify">
You sure will. When installed as instructed REV-ER-UP will lower engine noise and vibration, lower your operating temp, and you will enjoy new found power in your vehicles HIGH RPM ranges. And an increase in your vehicles gas mileage.
<p align="justify">
<a name="11"></a>11. <b>Can REV-ER-UP be installed in a sludged and smoking engine?</b> 
<p align="justify">
- Yes, install REV-ER-UP as instructed. Drive vehicle for 500 miles. Check the oil to see if
it is dirty, if it is, REV-ER-UP has finished its cleaning process. At this point change your oil and filter and enjoy the benefits of REV-ER-UP
