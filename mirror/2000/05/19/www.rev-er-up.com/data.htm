<b>Discovery of a New Microplating Process:</b>
<p align="justify">
<img src="images/datasheet/discovery.jpg" width="104" height="80" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" alt>REV-ER-UP has discovered a process of depositing a phosphate surface in a very thin molecular layer (less than a micron) onto metals using petroleum based motor oil or synthetic motor oil in the engine as the medium for transporting these proprietary plating fluids. This is a revolutionary new process in electroplating metal.
<p>
<b>Current Electroplating Technology:</b>
<p align="justify">
<img src="images/datasheet/electroplating.jpg" width="104" height="86" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" alt>Current electroplating technology requires that the metal being plated is completely clean-oil and soil free. Normally, all ions going into solution are positively charged. They are cations. When DC power is run through the anode, electrons are pushed onto the molecules in solution. They are then a negative ion or anion. They are attracted to and electroplated to the cathode (your internal engine metal). In REV-ER-UP's new microplating process, no external electromotive force (EMF) is used. The anodes are the molybdenum and phosphate metal ions themselves, which are negatively charged.
<p>
<b>How the New Technology Works:</b>
<p align="justify">
<img src="images/datasheet/howitworks.jpg" width="104" height="100" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" alt>REV-ER-UP has discovered how to change a cation to an anion in solution and maintain it. REV-ER-UP is a solution of ions (anions). Internal metal engine parts act as the cathode. Phosphate and molybdenum are separate ions, but they co deposit onto the cathodic metal forming an ionic phosphate/molybdenum surface. The two metals used in the REV-ER-UP electroplating process are:<br><br><br>
<p align="justify">
<i>Phosphate</i>
<p align="justify">
Phosphate has been used since the 1860s when it was used for corrosion proofing of corset stays. Phosphates form an iron-phosphate surface. Phosphate reduces friction and corrosion, and is used as a paint base for car bodies, valves, and other similar metal painting applications.
<p align="justify">
<i>Molybdenum </i>
<p align="justify">
A refractory metal, similar to tungsten, chromium and niobium, with tremendous heat repellent and high temperature strength. It is an element in the periodic table and has the lowest coefficient of friction of any metal. Molybdenum reduces the heat generated by internal friction, reducing heat transfer to the engine block, thus lowering the engine operating temperature. Molybdenum is used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) equipment to dissipate the heat.
<p align="justify">
<i>Reduces Carbon Build-Up</i>
<p align="justify"> 
REV-ER-UP has a detergency effect, cleaning engines, especially older, carbon and sludge filled ones. REV-ER-UP removes carbon build-up around cylinder rings.  freeing the rings up to do the job their intended to do.   From the time REV-ER-UP is applied to an engine, it virtually eliminates additional carbon and sludge build-up, allowing old parts to do their job.
<p>
<b>Increases: Compression, Combustion, Torque, and Horsepower</b>
<p align="justify"> 
<img src="images/datasheet/increase.jpg" width="104" height="67" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" alt>REV-ER-UP's molybdenum/phosphate surface improves the seals around piston rings and valves, producing higher compression. Improved compression reduces the amount of engine oil, which is burned, lowering hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. furthermore once the conversion  of the metal is complete,   a considerable amount of your engine's power robbing friction is eliminated. In fact, In a pin-on-disk machine study funded by &quot;CAMP&quot;(Cleveland Advanced Manufacturing Program) it was determined the active ingredient of  REV-ER-UP (PHOSFAMID) Reduced the coefficient of friction on metal surfaces from  0.6 to 0.07 or, an  85% reduction in surface friction. 
<p>
<b>The ASTM Timken Bearing Test:</b>
<p align="justify"> 
<img src="images/datasheet/bearingtest.jpg" width="104" height="111" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" alt>In the Timken Bearing Test (TBT), typical engine oil will hold about 3000 psi. Engine oil, with an additive like Teflon (PTFE), will hold about 4300 psi in the TBT.  REV-ER-UP, when the microplating is completed, will hold more than 200,000 psi in the TBT. leaving the biggest competitors in the dust, and remember this bond is permanent and as hard as a diamond.
