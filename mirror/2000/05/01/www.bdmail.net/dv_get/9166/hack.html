<td>We Are sorry to inform you that "BRAC BDMAIL" had been severely HACKED.
The reason that we did it :-
<p>1. Most of the ISP in Bangladesh only bother about money, not service
&amp; security.
<p>2. There is no unity in ISP of Bangladesh regarding defaulter clients,
getting more&nbsp; telephone line from BTTB, better service, etc.
<p>3. Attention All : "You might be the next victim" if you can't provide
security for&nbsp; clients.
<p>The Hacking has been done for the grater interest of Internet users
of Bangladesh.&nbsp; We are sorry to all of BDMAIL user for this inconvenience.
<p>Thank You.
<p>If you want to send any comments pls. send it at <a href="mailto:bdmail_isp@yahoo.com?subject=Regarding HACK">bdmail_isp@yahoo.com</a></td>
