DIEEEEEE" just go to prove that some people shouldn't be allowed on the net-->

<h1>European politicains:</h1><br><h3>Listen you 
<a href = "http://users.powernet.co.uk/orion/nazicnt.htm">Nazi</a> freaks, Britain 
doesn't like you so keep your <b>filthy, money grabbing</b>,
hands to yourself. We would do a whole lot better without your increasing
strangle-hold.</h3><br>

<h1>London rioters:</h1><br><h3>What exactly are you trying to prove?
Any of you that have genuine points to make should keep pathetic thugs out
of it. By associating yourselves with these goons, you are just making yourselves look
stupid!</h3><br>

<h1>Government agencies:</h1><br><h3>Don't use real criminals as an excuse
to satisfy your voyeuristic tendancies. Peoples correspondances are there own
and are private. What makes you think that - although you need a warrant to
search someones home - it's okay to rumage through anything they send over
the net. How about actually catching muderers and rapists rather than wasting
people's money on BB tactics.</h3>
