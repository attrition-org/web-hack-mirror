<p><font color="#FF9933" face="Tahoma" size="1">Well it's the alley cat<br>
puffin on the hootie mack<br>
some think I'm a criminal<br>
yo, I ain't all of that<br>
Hit you with a baseball bat<br>
when you wanna ill though<br>
you wanna fuck around?<br>
you get bucked on the Hill bro<br>
Kick you with a steele toe<br>
real slow hits from the bong<br>
make me feel like Cheech<br>
and I'm kickin it with Chong<br>
Just like Cheech and Chong<br>
frontin with an ice cream<br>
Cypress Hill is here<br>
to give you a nice dream<br>
speak it like I roll it<br>
and you know it's rolled tightly<br>
I'm like a funky beat<br>
why you tryin to fight me<br>
pigs often cite me<br>
that's not polite gee<br>
in any hour of the day<br>
you know I might be<br>
harrased by a pig real fast<br>
the wanna Rodney King me<br>
always tryin to crown my ass<br>
ain't got know class, no class<br>
I hit their ass like the buddah that's stinkty<br>
they wanna squalk<br>
but they're just so rinky dinky.<br>
I'm the freaka the one who freaks the phunk<br>
Sen's got the Philly and he's gonna light lite the blunt<br>
Sippin that tucufoo<br>
makes me go cookoo<br>
something like loco<br>
then I turn into disnookoo.<br>
Bring in the beta<br>
yea now the phunk's risin<br>
got the beta bass<br>
and the nazal highs in.<br>
As I kick the cumpy<br>
comin straight from my sinus<br>
crazy nazal vocals can I make the hotties loco<br>
I remenber sister maggie<br>
breasts were kinda of saggie<br>
use to sell me buddah<br>
out of fucked up lil baggies.<br>
Honey'd up a 20<br>
even when I had no money<br>
she said pay me back<br>
with some latin dick sonny<br>
I never went out<br>
and I don't think I'm gonna<br>
just for some buddah<br>
she wanted me to bone her<br>
demeaning,<br>
you think you know what I'm meaning<br>
I got something for the ho's that be scheming<br>
on the buddah real<br>
take a trip to hootah ville<br>
I'll throw you out the door<br>
of the big blue seville<br>
Then I'll lite another joint<br>
cause this ain't no exploitation homes<br>
for we are the one's strollin in the ways of the buddah masters,<br>
yea stones is the way of the walk.<br>
