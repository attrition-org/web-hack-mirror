<p><font size="3">Insanity Filmworks, Inc. (I.F.) is an
independent, motion-picture production company located in the
Seattle area; Tacoma, Washington to be more specific (don't
ask). We are dedicated to making good films that are both
cinematically fulfilling as well as commercial in appeal which is
not what people think when they hear the name, Insanity
Filmworks, but anybody that makes films the independent way knows
the derivation of the name; as you have to be crazy to do it. Not
only are we crazy, but we're crazy enough to love it. As a matter
of fact it is a prerequisite if you want to work with Insanity
Filmworks and it's creator, Writer-Producer-Director, </font><a
href="bios.htm"><font size="3">Jason Francois</font></a><font
size="3"> or any of his associates. No completely sane people
allowed, unless you have tons of cash in which case we're willing
to teach you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Through our website, we hope you will come
along with us an share the trials and tribulations of our arduous
journey. To those that are experienced in the filmmaking process
it will allow for a good brush-up on the process or at least a
place to find humor in the pitfalls we may encounter. For those
of you out there that are just getting started, make sure to stop
by and take a look at our production updates for </font><a
href="damaged.htm"><font size="3">Damaged Goods</font></a><font
size="3"> and later down the road </font><a href="nutshell.htm"><font
size="3">In A Nutshell</font></a><font size="3"> where we will
attempt to lay it all out for you to peruse.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">So, Please take a look around and let us know
what you think of our website (this is scary for us) and
periodically stop back to check on our projects and our site. And
if you happen to be an interested investor or an acquisitions
person for a distributor looking for somebody to sign that
seven-figure, multiple-picture deal, Jason would love to talk
with you right away!</font></p>
