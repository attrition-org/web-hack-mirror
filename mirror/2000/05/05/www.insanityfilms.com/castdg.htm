<p><font size="3">Bring on the thespians! Yes, indeed we have a
cast and a strong one at that. To play the role of Rebecca
Stanton we have chosen the very talented and lovely </font><a
href="babb.htm"><font size="3">Angela Nicole Babb</font></a><font
size="3"> from Portland, Oregon who brings a great depth and
natural elegance to the role of the &quot;uptight executive&quot;
as she pulls the audience into a web that she may or may not be
spinning. Playing Traci, the &quot;hopeless loser&quot; we have </font><a
href="salyers.htm"><font size="3">William Salyers</font></a><font
size="3">, a local actor who brings to the role his impeccable
sense of timing and mastery of character transformation that will
have you swaying constantly between love and hate for his
character; keep in mind however, that Bill is not really a
&quot;deviant&quot;, but is an all around good guy and should not
be &quot;booed&quot; or beaten when seen in public. In the two
other speaking roles in the film we have installed a local actor;
one very multi-talented </font><a href="donovan.htm"><font
size="3">Michael Donovan</font></a><font size="3"> (a.k.a.:
Co-Producer) who is pulling a &quot;Hitchcock&quot; to make a
short, but memorable appearance as one of the two cop wanna-be
security officers who happen upon the scene shortly after a
pivotal moment and do their best to mask their suspicious
tendencies while holding on to their belief that they would make
better cops than half of the LA police force. Joining Mr. Donovan
is another seasoned, local stage actor making an important
big-screen appearance as the rookie sidekick, </font><a
href="oconnor.htm"><font size="3">Colin O'Connor</font></a><font
size="3"> whose interaction with Michael and the
&quot;suspect&quot; help to round out a small, but stellar cast.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Also, joining the cast during
the re-shoots was </font><font color="#000000" size="3">James
Lapan </font><font color="#0000FF" size="3">as the janitor in the
new opening scene. It turned out to be a great role, played
perfectly by James and very well balanced by our lovely Angela
Babb. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Congratulations to a wonderful cast and thank
you to all of those amazing actors and actresses that gave us
their time to show us what they could do. It was a pleasure.</font></p>
