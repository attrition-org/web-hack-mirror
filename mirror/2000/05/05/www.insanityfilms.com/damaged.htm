<p align="center"><font size="4">&quot;A wickedly amusing story
of a reversed kidnapping, psychological perversions and fantasies
that are better left unsaid&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><em>Damaged Goods</em> is a film
which lends itself well to both the commercial masses and those
seeking artistic vision, in a way that few films succeed at. It
is a film that takes advantage of the voyeur and deviant that
lays deep within most people and fuses it with wonderfully rich,
psychological and artistic elements.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><em>Damaged Goods</em> benefits
greatly from a sharp, simplistic structure which is rare in a
market where many small films are failing miserably in an attempt
to be complex and loosing any semblance of good story-telling.
Strong story structure and compelling characters are paramount in
this wicked little film with a ton of heart. Or is it
heartlessness?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">The premise is something that was
designed to appeal to a strong share of the film viewing audience
on many different levels. It is a film that involves the audience
in it's twisted, yet seemingly naive motives and actions,
crossing the boundaries of demographics, posing as many questions
about ourselves and the human mind as it answers. Deeply
psychological, yet amusing and easy to follow, it draws its
reader/viewer in and shows them bits of themselves in each of the
characters. Simultaneously elating and frightening, the well
&quot;drawn&quot; inhabitants of <em>Damaged Goods </em>evoke
strong emotional responses from every participant.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">The story line lays on strong
doses of sensuality, healing, and kindness as well as it's fair
share of violence, foul-mouthed rants and good old unadulterated
perversions; in a manner that will make <em>Damaged Goods</em> a
winner between both men and women alike. A definite must-see date
movie for couples of... most ages.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><em>Damaged Goods</em> is best
described as <em>Extremities</em> meets <em>War of the Roses</em>
with one hell of a twist and a few stray gunshots.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><em>Damaged Goods </em>is a
wicked, dark-comedy about a lonely executive named Rebecca who
takes her hopeless would-be rapist, Traci, hostage without fully
weighing the consequences such an action carries. A woman who,
for all appearances, is orderly and in complete control of her
life is now faced with an incredibly perplexing and frightening
question: Now what in the hell do I do? Quickly, the remaining
bit of order in her life begins to crumble as her level of self
control declines in relation to the amount of psychological
damage that her hostage, a man named Traci, is intent on
inflicting. What ensues is a sometime explosive, but always
psychological and hysterical interaction between two completely
different people as she tries to fend off work obligations, a
drinking problem and visiting family while he tries to
haphazardly free himself or better yet, win his way into her
heart. Apologies and flattery take on a shameless new meaning as
Traci tries desperately to mend what he sees as a wounded
friendship that is hard to deny exists in some twisted sort of
way: Or does it?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">The shocking conclusion is only
reached after the stereotypical molds of the &quot;uptight
executive&quot; bred from high expectations and the
&quot;hopeless loser&quot; raised on no expectations slowly
crumble away revealing two people that despite their differences,
share one common thread with each other as well as every other
human being: we are all, in some way, damaged goods.</font></p>
