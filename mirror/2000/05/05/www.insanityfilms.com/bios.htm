Producer, Director, blah, blah, blah.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Jason Francois is described by
many as a born storyteller. &quot;They used to call it exaggerating, but
once you put it onto paper and give it a title, they call it a
story&quot;. OK, so he's in no way a liar...he's just got an over
active imagination. Haunted by this overactive and sometimes
twisted imagination, he headed for Vancouver, British Columbia in
the summer of 1993 to find a focus for his excess energy and a
certificate for his wall. In Canada, he wrote and directed the
short film &quot;The System&quot; in 1993, whose main character
inspired the off-beat styled characters that have made their way
into most of Jason's finished scripts as well as the many
&quot;almost there&quot; scripts in his personal library. <em>Damaged
Goods</em> is the first of many off-beat feature films written,
produced and directed by Jason within the next few years and
follows closely to what he calls &quot;simple cinema&quot;;
adhesion to the basics of good storytelling without all of the
unneeded extras (explosions, T and A, etc.). He also has done
time as an Assistant Director on short films; most recently the
35mm short, fantasy film &quot;Mushroomers&quot;; produced by
Liquid Reality Entertainment and Directed by Carl Raimondi.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Jason also brings to all projects his lifelong
accomplishments in the visual arts as well as strong leadership
and personal skills. </font></p>
