    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>NASHVILLE, TN</strong> &#151; (<a href="http://www.businesswire.com" target="_top">BUSINESS WIRE</a>) &#151; April 4, 2000
    &#151; Dallas-based Excel Communications, Inc. has chosen telecom software developer
    Equinox Information Systems of Nashville, Tenn. to provide advanced software solutions to
    streamline its switch information management. The software investment includes the latest
    version of Equinox&#146;s switch database update utility, Switch Interface 3.0, which was
    deployed across Excel&#146;s entire network of DEX 600 switches to unify switch database
    additions, deletions, updates, and lookups. The system was deployed in less than 60 days. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;In critical switch-based operations, the amount and
    type of information in need of updating has grown exponentially. Using remote switch
    terminals to maintain databases on our scale of operation is no longer viable,&quot;
    explained Chester Kenney of Excel. &quot;With Switch Interface, we can make switch changes
    quickly and accurately, which means we have more central control over our network&#151;no
    matter how vast we grow. Another selling point was the logic built into the system&#151;it
    can determine which switch or switches are affected and limit the options available to
    lower-level users.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With Switch Interface, Excel will virtually eliminate the
    use of remote switch terminals for order entry purposes. The Equinox system provides an
    unlimited number of users access to their entire network for ANI, authcode, toll-free,
    calling card, and account code additions, deletions, updates, and lookups. Offering
    advanced features including user-level security and an intuitive user interface, Switch
    Interface will also help Excel expedite record updates, reduce time-consuming errors, and
    create an audit trail of all activities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;One of the primary advantages Switch Interface offers
    Excel is the amount of time they will save maintaining switch databases,&quot; commented
    David West, Executive Vice President of Equinox. &quot;For a new ANI, Switch Interface can
    reduce data entry time by over 70%.&quot; The system will also provide seamless
    integration for every user to simplify switch information management and configuration
    throughout the network.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Excel already relies on Equinox for its network management
    offerings in traffic analysis and call record utilities. <i>Manager</i>, an advanced
    traffic analysis system from Equinox, helps Excel provision and optimize their networks,
    manage reseller accounts, and verify routing and billing. Equinox's <i>ShowCDR</i> allows
    Excel to view, search, and report their detailed call record information.</font></p>
