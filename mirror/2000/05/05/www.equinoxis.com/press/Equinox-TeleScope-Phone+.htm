    Global Traffic Growth</b></font></h1>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>By David West<br>
    Phone+</em><br>
    April 2000</font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">You may have heard the punch line: &quot;We lose a little bit
    on every sale, but we hope to make it up in volume.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Unfortunately, many carriers manage their networks this way.
    They lose money on some of their traffic, as they hope their increasing volume will offset
    the losses. For other carriers, the situation is even worse. With no way of connecting
    costs, revenue and actual call traffic, these carriers do not even know if they are losing
    money--let alone how much--until 30 or 60 days later. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">It's easy to get caught up in the challenges of the expanding
    global market, worrying about increasing competition, lowering retail costs, acquiring new
    customers; none of these is a simple issue. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">However, a focus on increasing traffic that ignores network
    economics is a blueprint for failure. Successfully expanding and increasing your network's
    profitability, particularly in the international arena, requires carefully monitoring
    costs, completion rates and revenue. Simply acquiring more traffic is not enough. Carriers
    must successfully overcome management challenges from within their own networks to
    succeed. </font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong><small>Risk Taking </small></strong><br>
    <small>As carriers seek to increase traffic profitably, they face many risks associated
    with increasing overall network volume. Highlighted below are some of the special
    challenges increased international terminations create. </small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">At the heart of overcoming these challenges are new tools
    designed to help carriers monitor increased traffic levels in real time, allowing them to
    efficiently configure their networks and enhance profits. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">With these new systems, you can join those carriers with a
    competitive edge among the expanding global madness. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Most carriers know when they decide to buy and sell
    international termination, they set themselves up for greater rewards--as well as greater
    risks. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;We realized early on that the international market is
    very volatile when it comes to price and rates,&quot; says Tina Gaynor, vice president of
    customer support and provisioning at CapRock Communications Corp. (<a href="http://www.caprock.com" target="_blank">www.caprock.com</a>). &quot;To keep up with
    the market, you have to measure minutes and costs based on quickly changing rates.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Because the international rate per minute is under pressure,
    carriers must lower their retail costs to remain competitive. To offset the lowered rates
    and to take advantage of network capacity, many carriers respond by increasing their
    overall network volume. Without an understanding of network architecture, rates and costs,
    carriers put themselves at great risk for lost opportunity, wasted capacity and even
    worse--negative margins which mean a hard hit to the bottom line. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Fortunately, new tools are helping carriers overcome the
    burdens of increasing network traffic volume. More carriers are discovering how real-time
    data management can make their growing traffic manageable and profitable. New systems
    provide carriers timely and detailed views of their traffic, links to their customers'
    financial status, and alerts to unfavorable network conditions. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Having up-to-the-minute visibility to these carrier
    operational statistics gives carriers quick access to the information they need to take
    advantage of competitive opportunities, especially in the fast-paced international market.
    </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;The challenges of effective traffic monitoring are only
    exacerbated in the international arena,&quot; explains Russ Johnson, vice president of
    operations of Atlas Communi-cations (<a href="http://www.atlascomm.net" target="_blank">www.atlascomm.net</a>),
    a switch-based international wholesaler and reseller of telecommunications services.
    &quot;The international market not only changes month to month, day to day, but minute to
    minute. You have to be able to make strategic decisions quickly, or experience great
    losses attributed to network inefficiencies.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Gaynor agrees. &quot;Carriers must have a real-time way to
    manage their routes and margin opportunities so they can take immediate action on an
    issue--or determine whether or not they need to take immediate action.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small><strong>High-risk Danger</strong> </small><br>
    <small>In addition to the risks rapidly changing rates and costs pose, high-risk customers
    add another danger. Many carriers seek customers to sell their excess capacity. Often
    these customers are small or start-up resellers purchasing international terminations.
    These resellers enter and exit the market and frequently move among providers in search of
    the best rates. Thus, they may be more difficult to locate and hold accountable than the
    more established carriers, increasing carriers' exposure to credit risk. </small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Johnson explains, &quot;Everybody's got a better, faster,
    cheaper way of doing it [in the international arena]. Companies come and go very quickly
    in this market.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Thus, carriers need to be cautious and have a reliable way to
    track their financial position with each customer. Even prepaid accounts may pose high
    risks, as carriers must ensure that their internal systems can monitor their usage on a
    timely basis. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">New technology makes it easy for carriers to monitor these
    critical statistics by offering helpful features such as real-time visibility. A real-time
    view of profit margins and completion statistics provides carriers, resellers and even
    sales forces valuable information so they can respond to rate and network changes with
    up-to-the-minute accuracy and take advantage of competitive opportunities. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Whenever carriers anticipate changes in their traffic
    volume, they must have a way to tie together their routing, capacity and costs,&quot;
    insists Johnson. He explains without quick access to this information, carriers simply
    can't price competitively or manage the capacity internally within their network. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Another feature, route choice alarming, actively monitors and
    warns carriers when their primary route choice drops below a user-defined percentage to
    indicate network trouble, incorrect translations or inadequate provisioning for their
    current level of traffic. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">These systems can lower the danger posed by higher-risk
    customers with built-in credit monitoring functions to help locate and hold accountable
    customers who may violate their credit limits. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Users can establish credit limits for customers and receive
    alerts, either on-screen or through a pager, when a customer reaches or exceeds a
    percentage of the set threshold. </font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small><strong>Switching Can Be a Welcome Change</strong> </small><br>
    <small>Until recently, most carriers have had to rely on traffic measurements from a
    switch to try to identify trunk usage information and potential network problems. The new
    systems are a welcome change. </small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Switch statistics and other operational measurements are
    based on sampling techniques rather than actual billing records. Carriers now have
    accurate call record information at their fingertips. Switch-based reports also do not
    provide carriers important cost information and other critical details. Carriers relying
    on switch information also have had to struggle with slow and cumbersome
    reports--problematic especially during busy times, when access to this information is most
    critical. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Carriers using in-house systems to view their traffic also
    are finding relief with the new systems, as they provide greater flexibility and are
    equipped with more sophisticated alarming capabilities. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Waiting for batch-mode reports or homegrown capture of
    call records is time consuming and inefficient,&quot; reports Gaynor. &quot;The benefit of
    these new systems is up-to-the-minute information they provide--it allows you to be more
    competitive.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">The systems prove to be a cost-effective alternative to
    in-house systems, saving carriers considerable in-house labor costs and hassle. They also
    provide many inherent benefits such as a centralized source of calling or country code
    data. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">The systems can help integrate information between a
    carrier's multiple billing and rate management systems (often of varying data formats), so
    they can estimate the revenue they will collect from each customer. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">In addition, such systems can utilize a company's billing
    data, eliminating time-consuming, labor-intensive and error-prone manual data entry for
    companies with large databases like CapRock and Atlas. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Increasing traffic, especially in uncertain markets like the
    international arena, can make adjusting your network operations to the needs of new
    markets daunting. In an instant, carrier rates, cost and completion percentages, and
    amount of traffic can change dramatically. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Fortunately, with practical network systems that put the
    right information in your hands, increasing traffic can be both manageable and profitable.
