<hr>
<p>The Office of Educational Development (OED) is a corps of
medical educators and staff with professional training in
curriculum design, theories of teaching and learning, and
assessment. We contribute expert knowledge to strengthen the
centralized teaching mission of the medical school. Our activities
are organized around the three major initiatives of Curriculum
Development, Faculty Development, and Assessment, along with many
other related projects, both in the quadrangle and in affiliated
clinical sites.</p>

<p>In the general area of <b><i>curriculum development</i></b>, we
work side by side with faculty to create, implement, and monitor
new courses, introduce innovative teaching methods, and investigate
new educational technology. To expand the <b><i>faculty knowledge
base in education</i></b> and enhance teaching skills, we provide
programs for all new and experienced tutors in the techniques of
the small-group tutorial, conduct sessions on clinical teaching,
and create workshops and seminars upon faculty request. We offer
personal assistance to individual faculty who wish to improve their
teaching in tutorials, lectures, laboratories, and clinics.</p>

<p><b><i>Assessment</i></b> encompasses students' academic
performance, professional growth and development, course and
clerkship evaluation, and related activities. Recent projects focus
on the development of new performance assessment techniques, a
fourth year comprehensive examination, and uniform assessments
across multiple clinical sites.</p>

<p>Born out of the realization that physicians need and want help
with the art and science of teaching and learning, the OED plays a
vital role in strengthening the educational activities of the
medical school. Faculty from all departments and divisions work
together in the OED toward the ideal of a stimulating curriculum
that flows logically from the preclinical through the clinical
years and enriches the educational offerings at the diverse
clinical sites. Our aim is to work with the HMS faculty to provide
a sound general medical education that will serve as the basis for
the graduate education of many of the future leaders in
medicine.</p>
