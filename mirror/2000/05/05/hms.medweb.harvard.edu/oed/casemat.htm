<p>The Harvard Medical School has been developing cases for
their students since 1985. The cases are based on actual medical
records with the aim of blending cognitive and affective learning
modesin the study of a real patient's problem. We hope that the
dissemination of our cases will promote on-going creative work in
the field of case design and development.</p>

<p>Over 200 cases are available for purchase from the Harvard
Medical School, Office of Educational Development. Cases have been
developed in a number of areas from the basic sciences to faculty
development.</p>

<p>For a complete catalog (contains case abstracts, indexes of
disciplines and diagnoses, curriculum map and pricing and ordering
information) please contact Kyle Niedzwiecki at one of the addresses or
