        <p align="center"><b>Welcome back to another exciting year!</b></p>
        Medical schools have recently recognized that students need educational 
        experiences beyond those available in teaching hospitals. In answer to 
        this educational need, ambulatory sites, rehabilitation centers, geriatric 
        facilities, nursing homes, health centers, and other venues have been 
        introduced to provide a comprehensive exposure to a broad range of patients, 
        illnesses, and care. For some schools this includes clerkships as far 
        as 1500 miles away. While none of the HMS affiliated sites are quite so 
        distant, we are arranging teaching in more locales than before, and we 
        have therefore felt the need for a transportation policy. Harvard Medical 
        School policy is that students are responsible for arranging their own 
        transportation, including that to and from their clinical sites. These 
        sites, with rare exceptions, are accessible by public transportation from 
        the medical school. Students who consider themselves unable to afford 
        the cost of transportation to a clinical site should be referred to their 
        financial aid advisor. The average cost for travel to clinical sites is 
        included in the standard student budget used to assess financial need. 
        If, however, a review of the student's financial aid case reveals that 
        s/he qualifies for further assistance, adjustments in the aid package 
        may be made by the financial aid office.<BR>

        Best wishes in your clinical experiences.<BR>
