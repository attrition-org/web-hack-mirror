	mentality. rootworm will setup projects where u can be part of if you are really motivated. We want to bring back the state of mind of sharing knowlegde, where
	everyone can learn from someone else. If your code/write/hack just let us know, we'll be happy to notify people that still want to learn and teach to 
	others. Sharing knowledge is our main project. Be there.

	<IMG SRC="icon.gif" WIDTH="7" HEIGHT="9" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp; The time of being back has come now. rootworm will get the fame as it has a few years ago.
	 U can't forget rootworm. It's still alive. Idling doesn't mean dead.

	See you soon.
