<H5><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Sup everyone. p4ntera here

for yet another korean hack. Why you ask? Because simply, everything

pisses me off and I can. There is no harm done admin, nothing

was touched (well except for the index) and nothing was deleted

(well..logs :P)</FONT></I></CENTER></H5>



<H5><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Special word goes out to

my boys in Pentaguard, wkD and mad props to the guys in 4:20.

Nice to see you guys back, schooling people and showing how hacking

is really done.</FONT></I></CENTER></H5>



<H5><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">I had a arguement with a

old friend today, he was saying that I have no skill and that

ptb is just a joke. Well, dood if you think that fine. It's bad

to say that though when you were the guy who was hacking with

frontpage before. Like I say almost everyone hacked with frontpage

at the starting, but talking completely wrong shit, saying that

I still use it is even fucking worse. I asked him to scan these

sites I hacked with a cgi scanner, but he still hasn't. As I said,

it seems once people start getting a little famous they become

cocky bitches. I exclude myself from that group, I think everyone

who has emailed me asking for help has got the answer they wanted/deserved,

and none were flamed or ignored. Whatever man, if you wanna be

cool with me cool, if not, shut the fuck up.</FONT></I></CENTER></H5>



<H5><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Everyone who has asked me

how this john dough shit is going, it's fine. I wanna make sure

that you all know I <U>never</U> doubted his skills, only said

he needed a attidude adjustment. He says we are cool now which

is good, because I would rather have allies then enemies. So word

to r3p3nt from </FONT><A HREF="http://dhcorp.cjb.net/">DHC</A><FONT

 COLOR="#ffffff">, glad we got that shit worked out. =)</FONT></I></CENTER></H5>



<H5><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">People have also been asking

us why we target korean sites. Well, one reason is they are really

fucking weak. Even a 8 year old like beligerant could hack them.

;). Another reason is because we have decided to hack sites around

the world as a practice ground, until we finally reach back home

in USA. Then E-commerce will feer, the b33r. =)</FONT></I></CENTER></H5>



<H5><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">We are still looking for

members to fill some shoes, and please we only want GOOD members.

If you think you got what it takes, you know how to code and can

hack yourself a good number of *nix boxes, then email </FONT><A
