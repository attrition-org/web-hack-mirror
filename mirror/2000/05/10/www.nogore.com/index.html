<p align="center">When you get hit by a blast from the past you'll realize you
didn't become what you wanted.</p>

<p align="center">Admin: mail me and I'll tell you what's wrong</p>

<p align="center">YTCracker, whatever happens good luck.</p>

<p align="center">Now, I got some remarks about putting lyrics, that it's
supposedly stupid. Well I guess people misunderstood so I'll clear that up: you
don't read who it's from, you don't think of the song, it's the idea you take
the time to read it. Some things make you laugh, some might even make you sad.
However it may be, it's a handy break from another trip to the coffee machine or
hanging out at some convenience store.</p>

<p align="center">Artist: Dr. Dre f/ Eminem<br>
Album:  Chronic 2001<br>
Song:   Forgot About Dre<br>
Typed by: Acastro929@aol.com<br>
<br>
[Dr Dre]<br>
Ya'll know me still the same ol' G<br>
But I been low key<br>
Hated on by most these niggas&nbsp;<br>
Wit no cheese, no deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys<br>
No boats, no snowmobiles and no ski's<br>
Mad at me cause&nbsp;<br>
I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries<br>
Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks<br>
To add to the wall full of plaques<br>
Hangin up in the office in back of my house like trophies<br>
But ya'll think I'm gonna let my dough freeze<br>
Hoe Please<br>
You better bow down on both knees<br>
Who you think taught you to smoke trees<br>
Who you think brought you the oldies<br>
Eazy-E's Ice Cube's and D.O.C's and Snoop D O double G's<br>
And a group that said muthafuck the police<br>
Gave you a tape full of dope beats<br>
The bomb weed stroll through in you hood<br>
And when your album sales wasn't doin too good<br>
Who's the doc that he told you to go see<br>
Ya'll better listen up closely<br>
All you niggas that said that I turned pop<br>
Or the the Firm flop&nbsp;<br>
ya'll are the reason Dre ain't been getting no sleep<br>
So fuck ya'll all of ya'll<br>
If ya'll don't like me blow me<br>
Ya'll are gonna keep fuckin around wit me<br>
And turn me back to the old me<br>
<br>
[chorus] x2 [Eminem]<br>
<br>
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say<br>
But nothin comes out when they move they lips<br>
Just a buncha gibberish<br>
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre<br>
<br>
[Eminem]<br>
So what do you say to somebody you hate (what?)<br>
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way (YUP)<br>
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way?<br>
Then study your tape of N.W.A.<br>
One day I was walkin by wit a Walkman on<br>
when I caught a guy givin me an awkward eye<br>
And strangled him off in the parkin lot wit his Karl Kani<br>
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not<br>
I'm harder than me tryin to park a Dodge<br>
when I'm drunk as fuck<br>
Right next to a humungous truck in a two car garage&nbsp;<br>
Hoppin out wit two broken legs tryna walk it off<br>
Fuck you too bitch call the cops<br>
I'ma kill you and them loud ass muthafuckin barkin dogs<br>
And when the cops came through<br>
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house<br>
wit a can full of gas and a hand full of matches<br>
And still weren't found out (RIGHT HERE)<br>
From here on out it's the Chronic 2<br>
Startin today and tomorrow's the new<br>
And I'm still loco enough<br>
To choke you to death wit a Charleston chew&nbsp;<br>
	&lt;Record scratch><br>
Slim shady - hotter then a set of twin babies&nbsp;<br>
in a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up&nbsp;<br>
when the temp goes up to the mid 80's<br>
Callin men ladies<br>
Sorry Doc but I been crazy<br>
There is no way that you can save me<br>
It's ok go with him Hailey (da-dah??)<br>
<br>
[chorus] x2<br>
<br>
[Dr Dre]<br>
If it was up to me<br>
You muthafuckas would stop comin up to me&nbsp;<br>
Wit your hands out lookin up to me<br>
Like you want somethin free<br>
When my last cd was out you wasn't bumpin me<br>
But now that I got this little company<br>
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease<br>
But you won't get a crumb from me<br>
Cause I'm from the streets of (Compton, Compton)<br>
I told em all&nbsp;<br>
All them little gangstas&nbsp;<br>
Who you think helped mold 'em all<br>
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns<br>
Like I ain't got none<br>
What you think I sold 'em all<br>
Cause I stay well off<br>
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off<br>
What cause I been in the lab wit a pen and a pad<br>
Tryna get this damn label off&nbsp;<br>
I ain't havin that<br>
This is the millenium of Aftermath<br>
It ain't gonna be nothin after that<br>
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap<br>
You can have it back<br>
So where's all the mad rappers at<br>
It's like a jungle in this habitat<br>
But all you savage cats<br>
Know that I was strapped wit gats<br>
When you were cuddlin a cabbage patch<br>
<br>
[Chorus] x3<br>
