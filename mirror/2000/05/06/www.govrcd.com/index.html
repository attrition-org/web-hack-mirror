<h1>ABOUT OUR COMPANY</h1>

<p>Government Records Services, Inc. (GRS), a subsidiary of Tyler Technologies, Inc., is a leading provider of records management and protection services, information management services, and application software programs to governmental entities.  Leveraging the combined expertise of Tyler Technologies, GRS can offer cost-effective data processing solutions that take advantage of all current technologies.  More than 25 years of local governmental data processing experience provides us with a solid foundation of knowledge and expertise to meet all of your automation needs.</p>

<p>GRS is an acknowledged technology leader in its marketplace, as its staff pioneered in
the introduction of computerized services into local governments. As early as 1976, staff
members of Government Records Services developed large scale on-line database management
systems. This same staff introduced microcomputers into county government in 1979, two
years ahead of the introduction of the IBM PC. GRS has developed and continues to expand a
series of comprehensive and cost effective integrated electronic document imaging and
processing systems for use in the County Clerk and District Clerk offices. In many cases,
GRS' products and services are viewed by customers and competitors as the standard for
competitive measurement.</p>

<p>The Kodak-certified microfilm laboratory, together with our custom-designed recording
cameras, produce a very high quality film image of the documents filed in more than 100
counties in Texas. This high quality film image is then used to produce an archival print
of the document and/or a digital image that may then be loaded into the systems installed
at the county.</p>

<p>Long term commitment and concern for the security, accessibility and archival
permanence of the recorded documents is a hallmark of Government Records Services. </p>

<p>GRS also has a complete suite of software products to automate the different tasks of
county officials. From creating appraised values of real, personal and mineral properties
to assessing and collecting the taxes, the business of appraising and collecting taxes has
never been easier with this windows based client server suite of products. </p>

<p>An integrated judicial package will allow all of the offices involved in the judicial
process to share information so there is no duplicate data entry. This allows the users of
the system to have access to the latest status regarding a particular case, which can help
avoid costly and embarrassing mistakes.</p>
