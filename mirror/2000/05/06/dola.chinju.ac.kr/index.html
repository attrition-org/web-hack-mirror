here. Artech, if u want to resolve this shit then fine.


Even though you said that linux doesn't matter, dood I havent seen a hack
from the likes of Crime Boys (who you hate yourself). Why? Because they
can't


hack. Period.


werd: wkD, #rootworm, DHC, Artech,Pentaguard, FTG, da_pest and any of my
./niggers in ph33r the b33r.


And this Jim Jones shit, I know he didn't do it. I think im cool with him
and I don't think he would say that.


Besides they insult themselves in it, heh ;)</FONT></B></CENTER></P>
