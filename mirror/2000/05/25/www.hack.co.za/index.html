   <title>The Source Code Thief Reveled</title>
</head>
<body>
Welcome to the new www.hack.co.za
<p>My name is phonic. you might have heard of me.
<p>Part I
<br>----------
<br>You might have noticed that recently a file was added called the Cisco
<br>Auditing Tool. This tool was a pretty nice all-in-one Cisco Router
tool
<br>coded by g0ne. I was helping him work on this tool, and I happened
to
<br>have a local copy of it on the machine I admin: Station 25. I might
also
<br>add that this is a state owned box. Well, as we were working on this
tool,
<br>we were getting it ready for release. Working out a few bugs, adding
some
<br>new tools, etc. So I had the latest version of the source in a private
<br>directory on my box. Also, I had a large collection of un-released
source
<br>code.
<p>Part II
<br>----------
<br>About a month or so ago, I was asked by a friend, whose name will remain
<br>confidential, if I would mind hosting www.hack.co.za for gov-boi, aka
<br>rage. Apparently, the previous hoster stopped hosting it for reasons
<br>unknown to me, so the site was down for a while. I, being the kind
and
<br>generous person that I am so well known to be =], said ok. So for the
past
<br>month or so, www.hack.co.za was being hosted here. I helped gov-boi
setup
<br>the dns tables, etc. so that the site would work and everyone would
be
<br>happy.
<p>Part III
<br>----------
<br>Like I said earlier, the pre-release source code for the Cisco Auditing
<br>Tool was on this box. On the night of May 25th 2000, I get a phone
call
<br>from g0ne. Apparently, someone had posted the source code to packet
storm.
<br>Well, this was strange because only 3 people, myself and g0ne included,
<br>had the source. I didn't think anyone on my box would have taken it
since
<br>I thought they were all trustworthy. It turned out I was sadly mistaken.
<br>After careful examination of the box, I learned that gov-boi rooted
the
<br>box, the box I was generous enough to let him use, with a local exploit.
<br>Not hiding his work at all, this was easily found out in the logs.
<p>Part IV
<br>----------
<br>gov-boi decided that in exchange for the generosity that I extended
<br>towards him, with nothing asked for in return, he was going to go behind
<br>my back, and steal tons of source code for his web site. I imagine
he is
<br>going to quickly change the dns tables to unlink this server from
<br>www.hack.co.za once he realizes that I found out that he is a source
code
<br>thief. Now, in my humble opinion, and I could be wrong, I think this
is
<br>really fucked up.
<p>Part V
<br>----------
<br>Finally, tomorrow I have to file a report about the intrusion and hack
on this system by gov-boi.
<br>Oh, did I mention that this is a state owned box?
<p>Thank you for your time.
