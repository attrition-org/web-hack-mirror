<P><b><font size=+1>Corporate Overview</font></b>

<p>Corel Corporation's success is built on its ability to deliver cutting-edge technology 
to the desktops of computer users around the world. From its early years as a 
pioneer in the graphics software field to its current innovations in business 
and Internet software for a variety of platforms, Corel has consistently developed 
products that respond to evolving consumer needs.
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>Since its foundation by <A HREF="cowpland_bio.htm">Dr. Michael Cowpland</A> in 1985, Corel has developed products 
known for excellence and value that target emerging trends in the software industry.
<ul><!--beginning of list-->
<li>	<b>1989</b> - Corel launches the first version of CorelDRAW®, which sets the groundwork for what is now 
		an internationally acclaimed, award-winning product<br>&nbsp;
<li>	<b>1992</b> - to coincide with the launch of Windows® 3.0, 
		Corel introduces the first graphics suite—CorelDRAW™ 3—a competitively priced, 
		all-in-one solution that establishes the company as a world leader in graphics software<br>&nbsp;
<li>	<b>1995</b> - CorelDRAW™ 6 is launched simultaneously with Windows 95 
		and becomes the first major 32-bit application available for the new operating system<br>&nbsp;
<li>	<b>1996</b> - Corel releases the first graphics suite for the 
		Macintosh® user—CorelDRAW 6 Suite for Power Macintosh®<br>&nbsp;
<li>	<b>1996</b> - Corel becomes a major force in the office productivity 
		market when it acquires the renowned WordPerfect® family of business 
		applications. In subsequent years, the company carefully re-engineers this 
		world-class software into a market-leading line of powerful productivity suites<br>&nbsp;
<li>	<b>1998</b> - CorelDRAW™ 8 for Power Macintosh is released to rave reviews<br>&nbsp;
<li>	<b>1998</b> - Corel releases Corel® WordPerfect® Suite 8 with Dragon NaturallySpeaking™ 
		which brings together two award-winning products to give users speech-enabled word 
		processing<br>&nbsp;
<li>	<b>1999</b> - WordPerfect® Office 2000, Corel's most recent release of WordPerfect, 
		delivers compatibility, ease-of-use and high performance at a modest price <br>&nbsp;
<li>	<b>1999</b> - CorelDRAW celebrates its 10th anniversary and Corel proudly 
		announces that sales of this popular product have reached an impressive 10 
		million copies. In May of the same year, Corel releases CorelDRAW® 9 Graphics Suite. 
		With numerous prestigious awards and the unique honor of being used to design the new 
		Euro coin, CorelDRAW has rightfully earned its place as the world's number one PC 
		graphics suite
</ul><!--end of list-->
<p><b>Strategy</b>
<p>Over the years, Corel has developed a strong product line that includes business applications 
and professional and consumer graphics software. By focusing its technology direction to offer 
customers performance, compatibility and value, Corel has become a leader in the productivity 
applications market while remaining dedicated to providing: 
<ul>
<li>excellent software products that give users access to breakthrough technology<br>&nbsp;
<li>cross-platform solutions that meet the needs of users in a multiplatform environment<br>&nbsp;
<li>flexible software products designed to meet the needs of diverse users<br>&nbsp;
<li>exceptional compatibility<br>&nbsp;
<li>unprecedented value<br>&nbsp;
</ul>
<p>Corel has also taken strong initiatives to be part of the new sub-$1,000 
and sub-$500 personal computer market trend that is enabling consumers to purchase personal 
computers for a fraction of what they once cost. Recently, Corel entered several significant
sub-$1,000 personal computer deals, including one that will see WordPerfect bundled with an 
estimated 18 million machines worldwide.

<p><b>GraphicCorp</b>
<p>With more than one million Web images and animations, clipart images, photographs and
downloadable applications in its collection, GraphicCorp—a division of Corel—is acknowledged
in the industry as the world's leading supplier of such content to software publishers and 
hardware manufacturers. This collection adds to Corel's vast selection of clipart and electronic 
images, and puts Corel firmly in the top tier of digital content suppliers.

<p><b>Access to Breakthrough Technology</b>
<p>The Internet is changing how people work and communicate—and Corel is leading 
the way by providing software that helps consumers stay ahead in a competitive world. 
The latest versions of Corel's business applications and graphics software include powerful 
Internet technology that makes it easier than ever to publish to the Web. 

<p>As part of the company's commitment to increase its presence on the Internet, Corel launched 
<b>ClipartCity.com</b>, the company's largest online graphics offering. Corel also launched <b>Designer.com</b> 
and <b>OfficeCommunity.com</b>, two free online resources tailored to the graphics community and the 
small business community, respectively. Both sites serve as a bridge to customers, keeping 
Corel in touch with their changing needs.

<p><b>Cross-Platform Solutions</b>
<p>Most organizations rely on a variety of computer platforms to get work done. 
In response to that reality, Corel offers business and graphics products for many platforms, 
including Windows 98, Windows 95, Windows NT®, Windows 3.1x, Macintosh, DOS, UNIX® and Linux®.
<p>In recognition of the importance Linux will play into the next millennium, 
Corel is taking great strides toward advancing the platform worldwide. By cooperatively 
working on projects with two major noncommercial, open source developer communities—the K 
Desktop Environment and Debian—Corel is on track to advance development of a new Linux-based, 
user-friendly installation and graphical user interface for the desktop.
<p>Download attempts of the free Corel® WordPerfect® 8 for Linux® have reached the one-million 
mark and Corel is the driving force behind the Corel Linux Advisory Council, a forum that brings 
together leading vendors and open source and commercial Linux advocates to discuss the challenges 
and opportunities facing Linux. In addition, Corel was co-host, along with hardware systems 
manufacturer Rebel.com, of the first annual Ottawa Linux Symposium.
<p><b>Unprecedented Value</b>
<p>Corel is renowned for its comprehensive, competitively priced products, as well as 
an innovative licensing program and outstanding professional services, which include 
top-rate ongoing support services.

<p><b><i>Corel License Program (CLP)</i></b> - designed  for small, medium and large businesses, 
as well as government and academic institutions, CLP provides the most cost-effective way for 
an organization to take advantage of Corel software.
<p><b><i>Corel® Professional Services</i></b> - this team of experienced professionals is ready 
to assist companies in implementing a complete technology solution and offers help in areas such 
as Planning and Design, Development, Deployment and Support.
<p><b><i>Ongoing Support Services</i></b> - from basic to advanced levels, Corel's Ongoing 
Support Services help users get the most from their software investment.
<p>The Corel License Program (CLP) includes several flexible, easy-to-administer
licensing options that will evolve and grow with an organization. CLP provides
the most cost-effective way for an organization to take advantage of Corel
software. Corel&#146;s technical services include a range of support options
to meet the needs of individual users, small businesses and large organizations.
From electronic support services that let users access the latest news

needs of large organizations, Corel helps users get the most from their
software.
