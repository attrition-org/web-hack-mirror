How to submit a request for permission to use Corel copyrighted material.
<p>
<hr width="585" size="1" noshade>
<p>
<a name="copyright"><b>What is a Copyright?</b></a><br>
<p>
Copyright is a right granted by statute to the author or originator of certain literary or artistic productions, where the author or originator is invested, for a specified period of time, with the exclusive right to do and to authorize a number of acts. Its most important aspects are the right to make copies and the related right to prevent others from making copies of the work. In the past, copyright has been used to protect literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works in print or written form. Today, copyright protection is utilized as a primary source of protection for computer programs and other works in digital form, which, even when they exist in a form unintelligible to humans, such as object code, are considered to be literary works for the purposes of copyright law.
<p>
<a name="permission"><b>When is Permission Required?</b></a><br>
<p>
Without obtaining written permission, you may be allowed to use certain images, software or text for advertising, in books and other printed matter, on clothing or other promotional items, online and Internet locations, for public exhibitions or demonstrations, in software applications, in television programs, commercials, movies, and/or video tapes; provided the use is not disparaging. The use must fall within the definition of &#147;fair dealing&#148; or &#147;fair use&#148; as defined under Canadian and/or U.S. and other applicable International copyright law. No use should mislead the public as to Corel sponsorship, affiliation or endorsement of your products or services.
<p>
NOTE: Please read the End User License Agreement (EULA) and other product documentation which accompanies each copy of Corel software to determine what rights are granted to a licensed user of Corel product. In addition you should consult with your own copyright attorney in determining whether your intended use constitutes &#147;fair dealing&#148; or &#147;fair use&#148;, as applicable. 
<p>
<a name="images"><b>Use of Images</b></a><br>
<p>
<a name="boxshots"><b>Box Shots</b></a>  &#150; Corel does not object to third-party use of box shots of our software products in advertising, on documentation, in books and other printed matter, on video tape, in software applications, on World Wide Web pages or in television programs/commercials/movies (&#147;Your Product&#148;), so long as the use is not disparaging and falls within the definition of &#147;fair dealing&#148; or &#147;fair use&#148; under International and/or Canadian copyright law, as applicable. Provided you adhere to the following guidelines, no further written permission is required: 
<p>
<ol>
	<li>You may not disparage Corel or any of its products in your use of
	 Corel product box shots. 
	
	<li>You should not use our product(s), product name(s), corporate name, box
 shots or other copyrighted material in a way that would indicate Corel
 sponsorship, affiliation or endorsement of Your Product. 
	
	<li> The Corel product box shot(s) must not be the most prominent visual
	 element. Your Product, company name, logos or graphics should be
	significantly larger than the size of the Corel product box shot. 
	
	<li> You should use only Corel approved box shots, including the entire
	product packaging. You may NOT use portions of the graphics, artwork or
	 trade dress from the packaging, nor may you alter the box shots in any way
	 except to resize to fit your needs.
	
	<li>The copyright attribution should state: &#147;Box shot(s) reprinted with permission from Corel Corporation.&#148; 
	
	<li> If any Corel product(s) is mentioned, the full name of the Corel
	 product(s) should be used at first and most prominent mention or as soon as
	practicable thereafter, and the Corel trademark(s) should be marked as
	 they appear on the Corel product packaging. A footnote attributing
	 <a href="trademarks.htm#guidelines">trademark</a> ownership to Corel should be used.
</ol>
<p>
 All other use of box shots of Corel products requires written permission.
 Please submit your request in writing with samples, drawings or mock ups of
 the box shots showing how you wish to use them. Please follow the
 instructions on <a href="permission.htm">How to Request Permission</a>.
<p>
<!--Corel product box shots can be <a href="boxshots.exe">downloaded</a> in .EXE format.

<a name="clipart"><b>Clipart</b></a> &#150; To see if your intended use falls within the terms for permitted use, please refer to the Corel Guidelines for:<br>
<ul>
<li> <a href="standard.htm">Standard Corel Products</a>
<!--<li> <a href="studio.htm">Studio</a>-->

<p>
<a name="photos"><b>Photos</b></a> &#150; Your use of photos included in Corel products may be considered appropriate use and may not require written permission. Please refer to <A HREF="standard.htm">Corel Guidelines for the use of Clipart, Stock Photo Images and Premium Photo Images</A> to see if your intended use falls within the terms for permitted use. If you are having difficulty deciding whether your intended use is appropriate or whether you require written permission, you should seek the advice of your own copyright attorney. Corel will not assist you in making this determination. 
<p>
<b><a name="screen shots">Screen Shots</a></b> &#150; *Please Note &#150; There are certain screen shots to which the following guidelines do not apply. If you wish to use any of the following types of screen shots, you must obtain written permission.

<p>
Provided you adhere to the following guidelines*, no further written permission is required.
<p>
	 	<ul><li>For all use of screen shots, rules No.1 to 4 apply<li>
	 	If your use of screen shots in Your Product is as part of a printed advertisement, book, product packaging or other printed material or as part of an Internet/World Wide Web Page, rules No.1 to 7 apply<li>
	 	If Your Product is a video, rules No. 1 to 8 apply<li>

	 	If Your Product is a television, motion picture or advertisement (ie. commercial) production (&#147;Production&#148;), rules No. 1 to 4 and Rules 11 to 13 apply.</ul>

<ol>
<li>You may not disparage Corel or any of its products in your use of Corel product screen shots.

<li>Screen shots from our products must not be the most prominent visual element in Your Product.
<li>	If any Corel product(s) is mentioned, the full name of the Corel product(s) should be used at first and most prominent mention or as soon as practicable thereafter, and the trademark(s) should be marked as they appear on the Corel product packaging.

<li>Your Product must contain the following copyright attribution: &#147;Screen shot(s) are [INSERT COPYRIGHT STATEMENT APPEARING ON THE COREL PRODUCT PACKAGING (e.g. (c) Copyright 2000 Corel Corporation and Corel Corporation Limited)], reprinted by permission.&#148;
<li>	Trademark and copyright attribution must be in the form of a screen dedicated to same and/or a label on each product.
<li>	Your Product will provide audio and/or visual instructions to overlay the screen shots of the Corel product(s) at a minimum of every five screen shots of the Corel product(s) so that there is no likelihood of confusion as the distinctness of the Corel product and Your Product.
<li>	Your Product will not allow actual access to the Corel product, unless the end user of Your Product has a valid license to the Corel product, and there is no likelihood of confusion as to the distinctiveness of the Corel product and Your Product.
<li>	Any prominent use of screen shot(s) captured in still photos (which might be used in advertising your Production, for example) must include copyright and trademark attribution stating the full name of the Corel product(s), with our trademarks noted as they appear on our product(s), as in the following example: &#147;Screen shot(s) from [INSERT COREL PRODUCT NAME] are [INSERT COPYRIGHT STATEMENT APPEARING ON THE COREL PRODUCT PACKAGING (e.g. (c) Copyright 2000 Corel Corporation and Corel Corporation Limited)], reprinted by permission.&#148;
<li>	If applicable, any printed use of our trademarks during the filming of the Production shall include the full name of the Corel product(s), and our trademarks should be referenced as on the Corel product(s).
<li>	If any prominent references to Corel, Corel products or trademarks occur in your Production, please submit a written request providing script samples and other relevant information.
