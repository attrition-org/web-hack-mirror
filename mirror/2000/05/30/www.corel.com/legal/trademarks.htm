<a name="trademark"><b>What is a Trademark?</b></a>
<p>
&#147;Trademarks&#148; include words, logos, designs, symbols or slogans used to distinguish one&#146;s goods or services from those of others. A trademark may be registered or unregistered. A registered trademark is a trademark that has been registered at the relevant trademark office (Canada and the United States have separate trademark offices). An unregistered trademark is, not surprisingly, a trademark that has not been registered. Both in Canada and the United States, trademarks are entitled to legal protection whether they are registered or not. Registration, however, provides trademark owners with certain advantages in enforcing their rights to those trademarks.
<p>
<a name="protect"><b>Why Protect Trademarks?</b></a><p>
When used properly, a trademark identifies one&#146;s goods or services as being distinct from those of others. For example, each Corel&reg; product bears one or more trademarks that identifies it as being a product sold under license by Corel. Through such use, Corel trademarks have come to represent the high standards of quality that is associated with Corel Corporation. As a result, the trademarks of Corel Corporation are considered valuable business assets worth millions of dollars.
<p>
Used improperly, however, a trademark can become diluted or fall into generic use, losing its protected status. For example, words such as &#147;escalator&#148; and &#147;zipper&#148; were once trademarks that became generic because they were not properly protected by their owners.
<p>
As the protection of its valuable trademarks is important to Corel, we have created the following guidelines to answer common questions about proper use of Corel trademarks.
<p>
<a name="when"><b>When is Permission Required?</b></a><p>
The use of Corel trademarks almost always requires written permission from Corel. On occasion, however, permission is not required provided you adhere to certain guidelines regarding the use of trademarks. The following guidelines are provided to help you to determine if permission is necessary.
<p>
<b>1.	Referential Use</b><p>
You may use Corel trademarks or product names (but not logos) to refer specifically to Corel products provided your use is not disparaging, and provided your use does not mislead the public as to Corel sponsorship, affiliation or endorsement of your company, products or services.
<p>
Please refer to the <a href="#guidelines">Guidelines for Using Corel Trademarks</a> for specific information on proper trademark usage. For a list of Corel trademarks and their proper attribution, please refer to the Corel Trademark List.
<p>
<b>2.	Titles</b><p>
You may make referential use, but not brand use, of Corel trademarks in single volume book titles (not series, periodicals or magazines), provided that such books do not use any Corel logos or trade dress; and provided the title page or copyright page includes a disclaimer of association with Corel.
<p>
<b>3.	Product Logos and Trade Dress</b><p>
Corel logos and trade dress may never be used by third parties except under a license or by following written guidelines from Corel.
<p>
Please contact the Permissions Department to request permission to use Corel logos.
<p>
<b>4.	Corporate Logo</b><p>
The Corel corporate logo(s) may only be used by third parties who are authorized by Corel to do so. 
<p>
If you are simply referring to &#147;Corel Corporation&#148; as a <a href="#tradename">trade name</a>, no trademark symbol is required and no logo should be used. 
<p>
If you are referring to &#147;Corel&#174 products&#148;, the registered trademark symbol may appear either at the upper right or at the baseline of the word &#147;Corel&#148;, but the Corel corporate logo(s) should not be used.
<p>
If you wish to use the Corel corporate logo(s) and you are not currently authorized to do so, please contact the Permissions Department to request permission.
<p>
<b>5.	Domain Names</b><p>
Corel does not allow third parties to use &#147;Corel&#148;, &#147;WordPerfect&#148;, &#147;CorelDRAW&#148; or any other Corel trademarks or product names in an Internet domain name.
<p>
<b>6.	Linking</b>
<p>
Corel does not object to you placing a link on your Web site to the Corel Web site, provided you comply with the guidelines for <a href="linking.htm">linking to www.corel.com</a>.
<p>
<a name="guidelines"><b>Guidelines for Using Corel Trademarks</b></a><p>
The following are general guidelines for the use of Corel trademarks. If you are a party to an agreement with Corel, please consult the terms and conditions of such agreement as it may contain special provisions regarding your use of Corel trademarks.
<p>
<b>1.	Use the Appropriate &#153; or &reg; Symbol</b>
<p>
A trademark that has been registered with a trademark office in the applicable jurisdiction is noted with a &reg;. A trademark that has not been registered with a trademark office is noted with a &#153;. Corel requests that when you refer to our trademarks and registered trademarks you refer to them properly. Proper reference includes the use of the appropriate ™ and &reg; symbol at the first and most prominent reference, or as soon as practicable thereafter. For a complete listing of Corel trademarks and registered trademarks please consult the <a href="tmlist.htm">Corel trademark list</a>.
<p>
Once marked, it is not necessary to mark subsequent appearances of the trademark in the work; however, all headings, titles and subtitles in the work that reference Corel trademarks should contain the proper attribution. It is not necessary to include &#153; or &reg; symbols in table of contents or indexes.
<p>
If the character set of your project lacks special symbols and superscript characters, use the following substitute trademark notices. Note the capitalization and spacing.
<p>
	<blockquote>(R) instead of &reg;, as in &#147;Corel(R) WordPerfect(R) software application&#148;<br>
	(tm) instead of &#153;, as in &#147;Corel VENTURA(tm) desktop publishing software&#148;</blockquote>
<p>
<b>2.	Provide Appropriate Trademark Attribution</b>
<p>
Include an attribution statement when using any Corel trademarks. The statement should read:
<p>
	<blockquote>&quot;[List of Corel registered trademarks used, beginning with &#147;Corel&#148; followed by any other marks in alphabetical order] are registered trademarks and [list of unregistered Corel trademarks] are trademarks of Corel Corporation or Corel Corporation Limited in Canada, the United States and/or other countries.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>
If it is not feasible to include the attribution statement (and if it is not required by any agreement you may have with Corel), it is acceptable to use a general-purpose attribution statement in a form such the following:
<p>
	<blockquote>&quot;All other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>
<b>3.	Use Corel Trademarks as Proper Adjectives</b><p>
Trademarks are adjectives used to describe a specific person, place or thing. As a result, Corel trademarks must be used as an adjective with a generic noun at the first and most prominent use of the trademark in any document or section of a document (e.g. at the first use in each chapter of document), and as often as possible thereafter.
<p>
	<blockquote>Example:

	When installing the Corel&reg; WordPerfect&reg; program...</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="tradename"><b>4.	Trade Name vs. Trademark</b><p>
The term &#147;Corel&#148; when used to refer to Corel software or a Corel product is a trademark and its use is governed by the general guidelines set out in this section. However, when &#147;Corel&#148; is used in text only to refer to Corel Corporation or Corel Corporation Limited, it is being used as the company&#146;s trade name, not as a trademark and is not subject to general trademark usage rules. For example, it is permissible to use &#147;Corel&#148; in the possessive if it is clearly being used as a trade name rather than as a trademark, as in &#147;Corel&#146;s software products.&#148; When &#147;Corel&#148; is used as a trade name, no trademark symbol or attribution is necessary (i.e. do not use the &reg; symbol).
<p>
<b>5.	Never Use a Trademark in the Possessive</b><p>
	<blockquote>	<B>Incorrect</B>:	CorelDRAW&#174;&#146;s outstanding productivity...

<br>	<B>Correct</B>: 	The outstanding productivity of CorelDRAW&#174;...</blockquote>

<b>6.	Never Use a Trademark in the Plural</b><p>
	<blockquote>	<B>Incorrect</B>:	Choose any of the CorelDRAWs...

<br>	<B>Correct</B>:	Choose any version of CorelDRAW&#174;...</blockquote>
<p>

<b>7.	Never Include a Trademark in a Hyphenated Phrase</b><p>
	<blockquote>	<B>Incorrect</B>:	Corel&reg; WordPerfect&reg;-compatible macros...

<br>	<B>Correct</B>:	Macros compatible with Corel&reg; WordPerfect&reg;...</blockquote>
<p>
<b>8.	Never Use a Trademark as a Verb</b><p>
	<blockquote>	<B>Incorrect</B>:	Your systems administrator can jBridge your application...

<br>	<B>Correct</B>:	Use jBridge&#153; to remote software applications...</blockquote>
<p>
<b>9.	Do Not Shorten, Abbreviate or Create Acronyms from Corel Trademarks</b><p>
	<blockquote>	<B>Incorrect</B>:	DRAW

<br>	<B>Correct</B>:	CorelDRAW&#174;</blockquote>
<p>
<b>10.	Capitalize Trademarks as They Appear in the Corel Trademark List</b><p>
	<blockquote>	<B>Incorrect</B>:	Corel Ventura&#153;
<br>	<B>Correct</B>:	Corel VENTURA&#153;</blockquote>
<p>
<b>11.	Never Combine a Corel Trademark With Your (or Another Third Party&#146;s) Trademark/Product Name</b><p>
Corel trademarks are used to distinguish products manufactured and sold under license by Corel from those of others. Combining Corel trademarks with trademarks or product names of others would confuse consumers as to which company is the source of the product.
