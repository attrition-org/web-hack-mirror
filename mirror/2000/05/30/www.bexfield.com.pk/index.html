<div align="center"><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4" color="#CC0000">another 
  quality defacement by ph33r the b33r?</font></b> </div>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4" color="#CC0000">-= 
  think again =-</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" color="#3300CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">i 
  haven't been into this defacing lark for long, and the main reason for that 
  is because it is lame, to say the least.......although i think, as a ./hacker, 
  i admire ph33r the b33r in some way (at this moment in time i cannot think what 
  that is thou) but the bad things about them FAR out weigh the good....</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#3300CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) 
  Why Deface? - Probably because ther little minds cannot think of anything better 
  to do with ther lives....</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#3300CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) 
  Arguments? - Hmm..some of your defacements are away of getting a point of yours 
  across...ffs, get a job in the news media if u want to do that, don't deface 
  sites that have nothing wrong with them other than a fuck for brain admin (althou 
  people think that IS a good reason, it ain't)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#3300CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) 
  Do something useful? - Personaly, i think that you have talents other than defacing, 
  which includes your talent to break into systems...this *could* infact be used 
  in a good way (shock, horror) so USE it (u can actually make some money, instead 
  of asking mummy for milk money...i know u think &quot;well, defacement don't 
  matter as long as i back it up&quot; etc...stop when u find a hole in the system....don't 
  go any futher</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#3300CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4) 
  Shouts? - This defacer will remain anonymous as i ph33r the b33r (not) and i 
  do not want to bring any legal / g00d groups into this defacement..no offense 
  to people who know me....this haX0r will be back, giving shouts to people</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#3300CC">FINAL: 
  ph33r the b33r...wanna contact me? for my leet skillz ? i will happily werk 
  for j00, as long as i don't have to get jiGGy with any of j00 fags </font></p>
