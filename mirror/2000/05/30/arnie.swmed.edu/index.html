<li><b>Why?</b> - Sorry Admin.  We had to grab Britneys medical records to find out if her tits were real or not...RDX knew they tasted weird.  I think everyone will be happy to know we have now finally solved the mystery, just remember who told you <br>first!<i>(<b>they're plastic</b>)</i><br><br>
<li><b>Who the fuck is ./Herb?</b> - Following our departure from rootworm, a few members/associates along with some other security minded people formed ./Herb. We hope to focus around helping the administrators of various companies and organizations realize how insecure their networks actually are, and helping them to fix the problem, not just leave them shitting their pants with a rooted box.<br><br>
<li><b>Note to Admin</b> - Do not let your users set passwords which contain their actual username in them no matter what numerical combination may follow(ex. bob would be bob69.) Check the daemons you are currently running for against simple vulnerability checks at www.securityfocus.com.<br><br><br>
