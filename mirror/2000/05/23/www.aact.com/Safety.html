  <p align="left">In addition, a major portion of our training effort is focused on
  hazardous materials.&nbsp; As for ongoing safety evaluation and training, we regularly
  monitor motor vehicle accidents, work related injuries, and numerous other issues so that
  we can appropriately target the types of training our employees need.&nbsp; After
  assessing this information, we distribute monthly training updates to address problem
  areas and to enhance the programs already in place.&nbsp; We provide Hazardous Materials
  Communications/Right To Know training; Bloodborne Pathogen communication training; and
  First Aid and CPR training as required by OSHA regulations.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">Testing is provided for our drivers in all areas of training. CDL training
  is available for non-driving employees who are interested in obtaining a CDL
  license.&nbsp; In order to become a regular employee, as a freight handler (Dock worker,
  P&amp;D driver, Line haul driver), there is a requirement to have a current CDL.&nbsp;
  This commitment to safety is one more way that AAA Cooper Transportation assures you of
  the best possible service in the industry &nbsp; </p>
