<h3>Tropical Shipping Announces Alliance With AAA Cooper Transportation</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>March 7, 2000 -- Tropical Shipping is pleased to announce expanded inland
  pick up service with its alliance partner, AAA Cooper Transportation, in order
  to meet the growing needs of our customers. Now, customers are afforded
  several new shipping options when shipping to the Bahamas, Eastern Caribbean,
  Virgin Islands and Central America.</p>
  <p>In cooperation with AAA Cooper Transportation, cargo may be delivered to
  any terminal in the motor carriers' inland network located in the southeast,
  southwest, Illinois and Minnesota on a CFS/CFS basis. Customers may also
  choose to have their shipments picked up from the shipper or forwarder's door.</p>
  <p>What's more, a revolutionary new pricing system is part of the service.
  Rates will be quoted on a per cubic foot basis from the receiving terminal or
  shipper's/forwarder's door through to any of the 35 destinations serviced by
  Tropical Shipping. Until now, no motor or ocean carrier has been able to
  combine two different pricing structures under one system. The tariffs take
  into account density models used by motor carriers along with
  weight/measurement models used by ocean carriers.</p>
  <p>For more than 35 years, Tropical Shipping has been the premier ocean
  carrier servicing the Caribbean. Ranked as the leader of containerized
  shipping services to the region, Tropical Shipping owns and operates a fleet
  of 18 vessels serving 35 ports throughout the Bahamas, Virgin Islands,
  Caribbean and Central America. With its headquarters at the Port of Palm
  Beach, Tropical is known for its dependable, fixed day departure and arrival
  schedule in all of its markets. The company's on time performance actually
  competes with air cargo in some locations. Plus, it is the only maritime,
  less-than-container load (LCL) carrier with a 'guaranteed to arrive' service
  standard. Additional information about Tropical Shipping may be found at <a href="http://www.tropical.com" target="_top">www.tropical.com</a>.</p>
  <p>AAA Cooper Transportation takes pride in its long, successful history in
  the trucking industry which can be attributed to several factors including
  vehicles and routes to systems and technology. Above all, the company's
  continued success is due to one, unique characteristic: people who are driven
  by a dedication to dependability.</p>
  <p>The new team is excited about the opportunity to expand our business by
  providing customers with exceptional value in transportation.</p>
