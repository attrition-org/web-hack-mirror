Since the inception of our formal Quality Improvement Process in 1990, AAA Cooper
 Transportation has used our Quality Policy as a beacon to direct the efforts of all
 our employees toward satisfying our customers in each business transaction.
<P>
At AAA Cooper we have used our Quality Improvement Process as an avenue which allows
 us to form partnerships with our customers. These mutually beneficial partnerships
 allow all parties to openly discuss areas such as: requirements, schedules, costing
 and commitment. These partnerships are at the heart of the growth and success
 AAA Cooper has enjoyed over the past two decades. Using these partnerships,
 AAA Cooper has been able to grow and expand with our customers, while at the same time
 attracting new customers through outstanding service and innovative ideas.
