State-of-the-art Computer Services:</h3>
<blockquote>
  In addition to reliable, on-time delivery of your freight, you can also count
  on AAA Cooper Transportation for fast and accurate delivery of information
  concerning every aspect of your shipment.&nbsp; We utilize a wide variety of
  the industry's most advanced computer hardware, software, and communications
  technology to enable us to tell you exactly what you need to know, when you
  need to know it.
</blockquote>
<h3>Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)</h3>
<blockquote>
  By transmitting data electronically we have eliminated a mountain of
  paperwork, and greatly reduced the chance of data entry errors.&nbsp; To put
  it simply, EDI makes us more efficient. It saves us money and we can pass
  those savings on to you.&nbsp;<br>
  <img src="images/girl_at_computer.gif" alt="Girl at Computer" align="RIGHT" width="216" height="176"><br>
  EDI can benefit you in several ways.&nbsp; Statements and invoices, for
  example, can be electronically transmitted from our computer to yours, thus
  eliminating time-consuming, error-prone paper shuffling.&nbsp; Shipment status
  reports - including locations and condition - can be updated and transmitted
  electronically for up-to-the minute information.&nbsp; Time and errors
  associated with payment processing can be dramatically reduced by electronic
  transmission of payment information.&nbsp; And to further improve the accuracy
  of billing we are using EDI for Bill of Lading information.
</blockquote>
<h3>Imaged Documents</h3>
<blockquote>
  The ACTION System (AAA Cooper Transportation Images Online Network) has been
  established to help us meet the informational needs of our customers and
  employees for imaged data.&nbsp;
  <p>The speed of delivering documents - and the visual quality compared to
  microfilm - have been vastly improved thanks to the use of the very latest
  imaging technology.&nbsp; Signed delivery receipts and Bills of Lading are now
  scanned and stored on optical media.&nbsp; These documents can be transmitted
  to your fax machine within minutes of your request via the internet track
  option or from our customer service.&nbsp; Future use of image technology will
  apply to other critical documents as needed.
