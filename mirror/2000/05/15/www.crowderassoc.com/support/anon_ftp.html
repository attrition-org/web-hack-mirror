<P>Virtual domain account users can allow anonymous FTP access to visitors
wishing to download or upload files to your web site as if you were running your
own FTP server.</P>
<P>You can enable (and disable) ANON FTP access within <STRONG>Edit Account
Information</STRONG> within your account <STRONG>Control Panel</STRONG>. Just
check (or uncheck) the check box labeled &quot;Anonymous FTP Enabled&quot;.</P>

<P><STRONG>Security<BR>
</STRONG>Anonymous FTP will grant any and all users the ability to access your &quot;upload&quot;
directory, or any directory on your domain that has been set for <STRONG>&quot;public&quot;
read/write permissions</STRONG>. Anonymous users will have access to upload or
download files to and from your domain. You <STRONG>must</STRONG> set the
appropriate permissions for your directories to <STRONG>restrict</STRONG>
anonymous FTP access. This is needed to ensure that anonymous users will not be
able to access any existing files or directories. You can inhibit access to
specific files and directories in your UNIX web hosting account using the
<A HREF="fileman.html">File Manager</A> by disabling public read and/or write
access to the files or folders you don't want people to see (ie. cgi-local). On
NT, anonymous FTP access is only available in the &quot;anonymous/&quot;
directory.</P>
<P><STRONG>Responsibility</STRONG><BR>
 As the account owner, you are responsible for any and all files that are stored
on your domain. This would include files that were uploaded by you as well as by
anonymous FTP users. With the use of anonymous FTP, your site is susceptible of
becoming a &quot;warez&quot; site. Typically, these are sites that are used by &quot;hackers&quot;
to trade (upload/download) illegally pirated copies of software programs with
one another. As the account owner, the complete content of your account is your
responsibility. If your site becomes a trading post for &quot;warez&quot;
programs, you may face legal action that can be taken against you by the
programmers/software companies of the copyrighted software. </P>
<P><STRONG>Data Transfer<BR>
</STRONG>Any and all FTP download transfers, anonymous FTP included, will be
used in the calculation of the total data transfer for your account. If this
total data transfer amount exceeds the limit that is set for your plan,
<STRONG>you will be responsibility for any and all overage charges that occur.</STRONG>
Please Note: There will be NO exceptions made for these overage charges. Once
anonymous FTP has been enabled, it will be your responsibility to monitor the
anonymous FTP activity for your account. All anonymous FTP activity is stored
within the &quot;<STRONG>xferlog</STRONG>&quot; file. This file contains
entries for each and every anonymous FTP upload/download session. This file is
located within the /stats directory of your account. There is also a link
provided off the &quot;View your web usage statistics &amp; logs&quot; page of
your account control panel. You can also have our servers perform certain
actions when your data transfer exceeds a pre-defined limit that you can
specify. In your &quot;Edit Account Information screen look for the following
section:</P>
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="images/data_transfer_limit_options.gif" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="50"></P>
<P><STRONG>Disk Space<BR>
</STRONG>If you are going to allow people to upload files to your site, make
sure you keep track of your disk space usage via your Control Panel. Do not
allow your disk space usage to get too close to your maximum disk space
allocation or you may experience problems accessing your site via FrontPage
and/or be unable to upload or modify files. You may purchase additional disk
space if necessary in 5MB blocks.</P></TD>

</TABLE>
<P>Once you enable ANON FTP in Account Settings within your Control Panel,
files can be accessed anonymously via a web browser using the following URL
format: </P>
<UL>
<LI>ftp://ftp.yourdomain.com/&lt;FILENAME&gt; </LI>
</UL>
<P>Anonymous visitors wishing to access your site via FTP client (e.g. wsftp)
must use your domain name as the FTP hostname, userid of anonymous and password
of guest.</P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE="NOSHADE">
<H3> How to set a custom &quot;Anonymous FTP Welcome Message&quot; on our UNIX
servers: </H3>
<P>When setting up anonymous ftp access to an account, you can set up a welcome
message for people browsing the site with a web browser. You can easily
accomplish this by following these instructions: </P>
<OL>
<LI>Create a text file called <STRONG>welcome.msg</STRONG><BR>
 (Must be in lower case characters.)<BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI>Place your greeting message into the file and save the file.<BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI>Upload the welcome.msg file to the root directory.<BR>
 (Transfer in ASCII format)<BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI>Now set anonymous FTP active for your account.<BR>
 (See this page for instructions)</LI>
</OL>
<P>Please be sure to set directory permissions for the appropriate directories.</P>
<P><STRONG>Notes<BR>
</STRONG>This will only work when you link to one directory. If you link to
another directory after the initial directory the message will not be displayed.
But it will be displayed if you come back to the original directory.</P></TD>
