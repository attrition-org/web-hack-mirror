<H3>Support - Acceptable Uses Policy</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is intended for use by mature adults (and by
minors when supervised by mature adults). Our customers are expected to use the
Internet with respect, courtesy, and responsibility, giving due regard to the
rights of other Internet users. The customer is expected to have a basic
knowledge of how the Internet functions, the types of use which are generally
acceptable, and the types of use which are to be avoided. Common sense is the
best guide as to what is considered acceptable use. The following are
unacceptable uses:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><STRONG>Illegality</STRONG> in any form, including but not
limited to activities such as unauthorized distribution or copying of
copyrighted software, violation of U.S. export restrictions, harassment, fraud,
trafficking in obscene material, drug dealing, and other illegal activities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><STRONG>Net abuse</STRONG>, including but not limited to
activities such as using a non-existent email return address on a commercial
solicitation, spamming (sending unsolicited advertising to numerous email
addresses or newsgroups and/or generating a significantly higher volume of
outgoing email than a normal user), allowing spamming by third parties to
promote a web site hosted by us, trolling (posting outrageous messages to
generate numerous responses), mailbombing (sending multiple messages without
significant new content to the same user), subscribing someone else to a mailing
list without that person's permission, cross-posting articles to an excessive
number of newsgroups, or attempting without authorization to enter into a
secured computer system. We reserves the right to determine what constitutes net
abuse.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><STRONG>Tortious conduct</STRONG>, including but not
limited to posting of defamatory, scandalous, or private information about a
person without their consent, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, or
violating trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><STRONG>Misuse of system resources</STRONG>, including but
not limited to employing posts or programs which consume excessive CPU time or
storage space; permitting use of mail services, mail forwarding capabilities,
POP accounts, or autoresponders other than for the customer's own account;
resale of access to CGI scripts installed on our servers; or attempting to use a
single customer account for third party web sites by allowing more than one
domain pointer to be used to reference pages within the customer's site</P>
