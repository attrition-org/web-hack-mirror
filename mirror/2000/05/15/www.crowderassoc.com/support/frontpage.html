        <H4><A NAME="Server">Server</A> Extensions</H4>
        <P>FrontPage Extensions are CGI programs which provide the server side
          implementation of FrontPage. FrontPage communicates with the
          extensions via HTTP using a Remote Procedure Call (RPC). When the
          server sees the &quot;POST&quot; request addressed to the FrontPage
          server extensions it simply directs the request to the appropriate CGI
          program. The extensions implement authoring (uploading/downloading
          documents, ToDo Lists), administration (setting end-user, author, and
          administrator privileges), and dynamic content (browse-time WebBot
          components).<BR> <BR> Without the FrontPage Server Extensions you
          will not be able to take advantage of the <A HREF="#Bots">WebBots</A>
          that are available through FrontPage. Also, without the extensions you
          cannot author and administer your web using the tools provided as part
          of the FrontPage Editor/Explorer package.<BR> </P>

            currently on the site to install the extensions. However, if there
            are directories or files with special permissions (.htaccess) these
            will have to be removed. You can then re-establish permissions and
            password protection via the FrontPage Explorer.)</LI>

        <P>There are some issues which potential FrontPage users should
          consider:</P>
        <OL>
          <LI><A NAME="Web size"><STRONG>Web size</STRONG></A> -- This seems
            to be most critical when a &quot;searchable event&quot; is present
            in the web (Search, Discussion Forum and Table of Contents). The
            lengthy process of updating the indices for these functions can lead
            to the connection timing-out (HTTP 500 Error or 'Server has
            timed-out').<BR> </LI>
          <LI><STRONG>Disk Usage</STRONG> -- <A>You may </A>create and
            publish as many child webs as your disk storage space allows.
            However, for each child web you publish, FrontPage duplicates
            certain information into indices and hidden files. This adds &quot;overhead&quot;,
            increasing the storage space required for your files. Microsoft's
            documentation notes, &quot;FrontPage 97's optional full-text search
            indexes can take up to the same amount of disk space as your textual
            content.&quot;<BR> </LI>
          <LI><A NAME="PRECAUTIONS"><STRONG>PRECAUTIONS</STRONG></A><STRONG><BR>
            </STRONG><BR> There are several precautions which need to be taken
            to protect the FrontPage extensions on your&nbsp; site if it is
            housed on the UNIX servers:<BR> <BR> a) Do NOT use the Edit Access
            or File Manager features found in your Control Panel to set
            passwords, limit access, set file permissions or delete directories
            or files in a FrontPage web. This should only be done through the
            options in FrontPage Explorer.<BR> <BR> b) Do NOT use regular FTP
            (such as WS_FTP) to upload files to the server when FrontPage
            extensions are installed. This may corrupt the extensions, disabling
            the interactive features available with FrontPage.<BR> <BR> NOTE:
            The exception to this is when loading custom scripts to the
            cgi-local directory on your site. Instructions for uploading custom&nbsp;
            CGI scripts is included in the notice you will receive when the
            extensions are installed.<BR> </LI>

        <P>WebBots are the mechanism for invoking many of the interactive
          features built into FrontPage. These features are added to your web
          through the FrontPage Editor | Insert WebBot Component</P>
        <P ALIGN="left">Some, such as Include and Subsitution allow elements of
          the web to be entered once and included in any or all of the pages by
          inserting the Bot component referencing that element (e.g. a logo or
          navigation bar). Changes made to the &quot;master&quot; element are
          made automatically to any page containing the referencing Bot.</P>
        <P ALIGN="left">Other Bots, such as Search, Table of Contents and
          Timestamp, control dynamic browse-time features. These Bots work
          behind the scenes to keep the web up-to-date for visitors.</P>
        <P ALIGN="left">The Page Counter Bot, which is available from the
          FrontPage CD-ROM or Microsoft web-site will not work on Crowder
