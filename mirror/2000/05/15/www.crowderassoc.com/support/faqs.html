<H4> <A NAME="webhosting">What is virtual Web hosting?</A></H4>
<P>We specialize in virtual Web hosting, which means that you can find a home
for your Web site on our high performance Web servers and establish your
presence on the Internet with your own unique domain name. This is a very
intelligent and cost effective alternative to hosting your own web site
internally. Our shared hosting environment gives you the benefits of high
performance servers, high bandwidth connectivity that can seamlessly grow with
your needs, pre-installed software, guaranteed reliability and around-the-clock
support, all at a small fraction of the cost of doing it yourself.</P>
<P><A HREF="#0"><FONT SIZE="1">Back to the top.</FONT></A></P><HR>
<H4><A NAME="datatransfer">Is 500 MB/month of data transfer going to be enough
to support my web site ?</A></H4>
<P>Our experience has shown that 500 MB/month will be more than enough
bandwidth for the average Web site. Depending on the quantity and size of your
files, this could support thousands of hits per month. Note that only a small
percentage of our customers have exceeded our data transfer threshold. Should
your needs grow, however, we have cost effective plans that are designed to grow
with you. For example, most of our customers begin with our Professional plan.
Those whose sites have become quite popular have either paid $0.10/MB/mo. for
additional data transfer or have upgraded to our Corporate or Commercial plans,
which have much higher data transfer limits. A very small percentage of our
customers with extremely popular sites have found it cost effective to upgrade
to our Enterprise or High Volume plans which have high enough data transfer
limits to accommodate nearly all of our customers' needs.</P>
<P><A HREF="#0"><FONT SIZE="1">Back to the top.</FONT></A></P><HR>
<H4><A NAME="ftp">How do I transfer files to my Web site ?</A></H4>
<P>Files can be transferred to the Web server via File Transport Protocol
(FTP). If you have a PPP Internet account and need FTP software, you can
download a program for either the PC or Mac from our site. Internet providers
such as AOL, Compuserve, and Prodigy may have a built-in FTP interface. An FTP
tutorial is available for first-time users.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Microsoft FrontPage users can 'publish' their
sites to our server and should not use FTP.</FONT></P>
<P><A HREF="#0"><FONT SIZE="1">Back to the top.</FONT></A></P><HR>
<H4><A NAME="howlong">How long does it take to set up a new account ?</A></H4>
<P>Most accounts are set up and active within 24 hours! Once an account is set
up an activation notice will be sent you via e-mail including a userID,
password, and FTP hostname. You can begin uploading files to your new web site
immediately thereafter. Domain account users will be given a temporary URL to
access their site via the Web prior to the completion of either domain
registration or transfer.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>Domain Name Related Questions</H3><HR>
<H4><A NAME="www">Will I be able to access my domain name with or without the
'www.'?</A></H4>
<P>Yes, you will be able to access the domain name with or without the 'www.'
in front. For example, you can access the domain name &quot;mydomain.com&quot;
by going to &quot;www.mydomain.com&quot; as well as &quot;mydomain.com&quot;.</P>
<P><A HREF="#0"><FONT SIZE="1">Back to the top.</FONT></A></P><HR>
<H4><A NAME="domainregistration">Do you handle domain registration?</A></H4>
<P>Yes. We will contact the InterNIC once your account is activated to request
either a new domain name registration or a transfer. You do NOT need to submit a
registration or modification template to the InterNIC, as this will only delay
your request.</P>
<P>When an account is activated with a new domain name, we will automatically
send the registration template to InterNIC. The information sent on the template
is pulled directly from the order form. InterNIC typically completes the
registration within 24 hours, and propagation typically takes about 72 hours.</P>
<P>Let us know if you do not receive notification that a domain name has either
been registered or transferred within two weeks. In the meantime, refer all
concerns to <A HREF="http://internic.net/rs-internic.html">Registration
Services</A>. You can reach them by calling (703)742-4777 and selecting option
number 2, or you may write them at <A HREF="mailto:hostmaster@rs.internic.net">hostmaster@rs.internic.net</A>.
Be sure to reference your NIC ticket number when contacting either us or the
InterNIC. </P>
<P><A HREF="#0"><FONT SIZE="1">Back to the top.</FONT></A></P><HR>
<H4><A NAME="nichandle">What is a NIC handle?</A></H4>
<P>Every entity registered with InterNIC has a NIC handle. You can use the same
NIC handle as the contact for several domains. This way, if you make a change to
the NIC handle (i.e., the e-mail address), all domains using that NIC handle
will be updated as well.</P>
<P><A HREF="#0"><FONT SIZE="1">Back to the top.</FONT></A></P><HR>
<H4><A NAME="billing">Who should I contact regarding InterNIC billing? </A></H4>
<P>Questions regarding InterNIC
<A HREF="http://rs.internic.net/domain-info/billing-FAQ.html">Invoicing and
Payment Procedures</A> should be referred to Registration Services. You can
reach them by calling (703)742-4777 and selecting option number 1, or you may
e-mail them at <A HREF="mailto:hostmaster@rs.internic.net">hostmaster@rs.internic.net</A>.
</P>
<P>Customers wishing to make payment by credit card may call either
(888)771-3000 or (402)496-9788 (outside the U.S.). </P>
<P><A HREF="#0"><FONT SIZE="1">Back to the top.</FONT></A></P><HR>
<H4><A NAME="transfer">Can I transfer an existing domain name?</A></H4>
<P>Yes. Whether you place an order by telephone or via our online order form,
be sure to specify that you are requesting a <STRONG>transfer</STRONG> and NOT
a new domain. You should keep the service at your present site while waiting for
your domain name to transfer. We will provide you with a temporary IP address so
you can mirror your site on our server. All e-mail and Web pages will still be
accessed from your current site. When InterNIC receives the template, they will
generate an acknowledgment request (Ack/Nak) and send it to the current
administrative contact of the domain. Once the administrative contact
acknowledges the transfer, InterNIC will update their records. </P>
<P>It is very important that you use the same company name and address on the
template as that which is on file at InterNIC. If the company name differs from
that which is on file, InterNIC will treat the transfer as a delete/new and will
not allow the transfer to be completed.</P>
<P>If the contact information for the domain is no longer current, you will
need to prepare a fax on company letterhead, as follows: </P>
<OL>
<LI>Include company name, address and phone number in the header</LI>
<LI>Reference the domain name and NIC tracking number</LI>
<LI>Request the domain name modification in accordance with the NIC number to
the new Name Servers</LI>
<LI>Have the President or Vice-President of your company sign the request</LI>
<LI>Print the name and title below signature</LI>
<LI>Fax this letter to us, ATTN: DOMREG department with 'InterNIC' as the
subject.</LI>
</OL>
<P><A HREF="#0"><FONT SIZE="1">Back to the top.</FONT></A></P><HR>
<H4><A NAME="purchasedomain">I have purchased my domain name from another
company. How can I update the information at InterNIC?</A></H4>
<P>In order to transfer a domain name from one organization to another,
InterNIC requires that the original owner file a &quot;delete/new&quot;
template. This template consists of two domain registration templates, combined
into one e-mail. The first template deletes the registration of the original
domain name, and the second re-registers the domain name using the new owner&#146;s
information. This request must be initiated by the original owner, as the owner
is the only one authorized to make such a modification.</P>
<P><A HREF="#0"><FONT SIZE="1">Back to the top.</FONT></A></P><HR>
<H4><A NAME="propagation">How long does it take before my domain name is
active?</A></H4>
<P>Once the InterNIC announces that your domain name has been registered (or
transferred, if applicable), it usually takes about 72 hours before it visible
to all users of the Internet. All Internet providers must update their records
(DNS tables) to reflect new site locations. This process is called propagation.</P>
<P><A HREF="#0"><FONT SIZE="1">Back to the top.</FONT></A></P><HR>
<H4><A NAME="internicfee">What is the InterNIC fee for domain registration ?</A></H4>
<P>The InterNIC charges $70 to register a new domain name. This fee covers the
first two years, as they currently bill at a rate of $35 per year. The InterNIC
will send you an invoice via e-mail between three to six weeks after the domain
is registered.</P>

<H3>Microsoft FrontPage Related Questions </H3>
<P>Answers to questions you may have about using Microsoft's FrontPage on our
UNIX Servers.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><STRONG>NOTE</STRONG></FONT>: For specific
information on how to <EM>use</EM> the FrontPage software, please consult the
program's documentation or <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/">Microsoft
Technical Support</A>.</P><HR>
<H4><A NAME="Server">Server</A> Extensions </H4>
<P>FrontPage extensions are CGI programs that provide the server side
implementation of FrontPage. FrontPage communicates with the extensions via HTTP
using a Remote Procedure Call (RPC). When the server sees the &quot;POST&quot;
request addressed to the FrontPage server extensions it simply directs the
request to the appropriate CGI program. The extensions implement authoring
(uploading/downloading documents, ToDo lists), administration (setting end-user,
author, and administrator privileges), and dynamic content (browse-time WebBot
components).<BR>
<BR>
 Without the FrontPage server extensions you will not be able to take advantage
of the WebBots that are available through FrontPage. Also, without the
extensions you cannot author and administer your web using the tools provided as
part of the FrontPage Editor/Explorer package.<BR>

<H4>New Accounts</H4>
<P>Check the box on the order form indicating that you want the FrontPage
extensions. New domains that request the FrontPage extensions when the order is
placed will have the extensions installed within two days of activation.</P>
<H4>Existing Accounts</H4>
<P>To have the FrontPage server extensions installed on your existing site,
send an e-mail request to support with the following information: </P>
<UL>
<LI>Your domain name</LI>
<LI>Your userID</LI>
<LI>Your request for FrontPage extensions.</LI>
<LI>Confirmation that you have back-up of any Web pages currently on the site.<BR>
 (In most cases it is not necessary to delete files currently on the site to
install the extensions. However, if there are directories or files with special
permissions (.htaccess) these will have to be removed. You can then re-establish
permissions and password protection via the FrontPage Explorer.)</LI>
</UL>
<P>On existing sites, the installation will generally be done within 24 hours.</P>
<H5><A HREF="#0"><FONT SIZE="1">Back to the top.</FONT></A></H5><HR>
<H4><A NAME="Charges">Charges</A></H4>
<P>There is no charge for installing the server extensions. We will also

<H4><A NAME="Limitations">Limitations</A></H4>
<P>There are some issues that potential FrontPage users should consider: </P>
<OL>
<LI><A NAME="Web size"><STRONG>Web size</STRONG></A> -- This seems to be most
critical when a &quot;searchable event&quot; is present in the web (Search,
Discussion Forum and Table of Contents). The lengthy process of updating the
indices for these functions can lead to the connection timing-out (HTTP 500
Error or 'Server has timed-out').<BR>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Disk Usage</STRONG> -- <A>You may </A>create and publish as many
child webs as your disk storage space allows. However, for each child web you
publish, FrontPage duplicates certain information into indices and hidden files.
This adds 'overhead,' increasing the storage space required for your files.
Microsoft's documentation notes, &quot;FrontPage's optional full-text search
indexes can take up to the same amount of disk space as your textual content.&quot;<BR>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="PRECAUTIONS">PRECAUTIONS</A><BR>
</STRONG> There are several precautions which need to be taken to protect the
FrontPage extensions on your&nbsp;site if it is housed on our UNIX servers:<BR>
<BR>
 a) Do NOT use the Edit Access or File Manager features found in your Control
Panel to set passwords, limit access, set file permissions or delete directories
or files in a FrontPage web. This should only be done through the options in
FrontPage Explorer.<BR>
<BR>
 b) Do NOT use regular FTP (such as WS_FTP) to upload files to the server when
FrontPage extensions are installed. This may corrupt the extensions, disabling
the interactive features available with FrontPage.<BR>
<BR>
 NOTE: The exception to this is when loading custom scripts to the cgi-local
directory on your site. Instructions for uploading custom&nbsp; CGI scripts is
included in the notice you will receive when the extensions are installed.<BR>
