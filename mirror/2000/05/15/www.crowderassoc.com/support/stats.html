<H3>Support - Usage Statistics</H3>
<P>Detailed usage statistics are generated for all of our customers' accounts.
These detailed statistics can show you what domains are accessing your site, how
many &quot;hits&quot; you are getting, how much data is being transferred, what
type of browser people are using to look at your site, and more. </P><HR>
<P><STRONG>To use our built-in analysis programs on UNIX:</STRONG></P>
<P>Our UNIX web hosting customers may use one of our built-in analysis programs
to view their usage statistics, or they may use a third-party usage stats
analysis program to analyze the raw log files generated in their account.</P>
<P>Select 'Edit Account Information' in your Control Panel. Then choose which
program you want as your &quot;Preferred Stats&quot; program: </P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>MkStats v1.0</STRONG> &nbsp; (Note: MkStats analyzes only the past
90 days worth of stats. <A HREF="#*">more...</A>)</LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.mkstats.com/example/"><STRONG>MkStats v2.1</STRONG></A></LI>

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="http://www.webtrends.com/">WebTrends</A>:</STRONG>
selecting this option will allow you to download Virtual WebTrends software for
FREE. Unlike the above server-side programs, WebTrends runs locally on your own
PC.</LI>
</UL>
<P>You will not be able to view any usage statistics for your account until
approximately 48 hours after choosing one of the above programs. Also, these
programs are system-wide programs and cannot be custom configured for one
customer.</P>
<P>To view your usage statistics using the 'preferred stats' program you chose,
go to your <STRONG>Control Panel</STRONG> and select '<STRONG>View your web
usage statistics &amp; logs</STRONG>'. </P><HR>
<P><STRONG>To use a third-party analysis program:</STRONG></P>
<P>All customers have access to the raw log files. Therefore, you can use
third-party log analysis programs on your local PC to get in-depth analysis of
your web site usage. If needed, you can download the raw log files to your local
computer for analysis and use gzip to uncompress them if you need to run custom
queries against the data. We use standard GNU &quot;gzip&quot; format without
any special options. Mac users who have trouble unzipping the logs with Stuffit
Expander should try using MacGzip.</P>
<P>Note: You have access to the raw log files whether or not you choose one of
our built-in analysis programs. Therefore, you can choose to use our programs,
your programs, or both.</P><HR>
<H4><A NAME="data_transfer">Monitoring Data Transfer</A></H4>
<P>Although only a relatively small number of accounts exceed the allotted data
transfer each month, we would like to point out that several web-based
interfaces exist which allow you to monitor data transfer and be alerted when a
certain amount of data transfer is used.</P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDERCOLOR="#000066">

<P><A NAME="*">*</A><SMALL>There seem to be many questions on how MKSTATS
compiles statistics. One of the most confusing aspects of this statistical
package is why hits from past months decline as time progresses. You may have
noticed as an example, hits from a previous month was X amount. Now a month
later, those hits have dropped. The reason is as follows:</SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>MKSTATS compiles statistics for a 90 day span. This means that as
time progresses, the data early in that span begins to drop off as new data for
the current month is added. Imagine it as a sliding window, only the most
current 90 days are kept. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>For an example, let's look at this from the first of the year. When
we hit day 95 in the year, the package compile statistics for days 5-95, a span
of 90 days. Day 5 is still January, but, as you can see, the data for January's
days 1-4 have dropped off. When stats compile the next day, days 6-96, more of
the January data is being dropped. This is why the hit total for the last
trailing month (January in this example) declines.</SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>If you wish to not limit your stats to a 90 day sliding window, we
suggest switching your statistical package to ANALOG. ANALOG does not have this
behavior and will compile statistics for all the data in your gz log files. If
the data is in there, ANALOG will compile it all.</SMALL></P></TD>
