As time allows from my school and work load( it is harvest season here) I will try to update and add more pages and information.<h3>I try to make my page as informational as possible,  what the Internet really needs is content and not just a bunch of links to others sites.  So I am always looking for new ideas.  <br>Go ahead and look at my Amateur Radio Web Page to see what I have been up to:<br><h3><h2><a href="home.html">KB0YKI's Radio Zone</a></h2><h4>It includes such topics :<UL><LI>antenna building</li><LI>plans for antennas</li> <LI>a huge bookmarks page of radio, computer items, agriculture, and miscellaneous </li>  <LI>scanner radio frequency list for Northeast Missouri and Western Illinois</li></UL><hr><h3>Also don't forget to check out:<br><UL><LI> <a href="www.culver.edu">Culver-Stockton College's page</a> the school I am presently attending. <br></li><LI><a href="http://www.tristateads.com">Tri-State Ads</a> who are trying to keep our county and region strong through promotion and advertising .</h3></UL><hr></BODY></HTML>
