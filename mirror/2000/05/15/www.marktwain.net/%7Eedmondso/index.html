<P><FONT COLOR=00FF00><FONT SIZE=4>I spent almost 6 years in the United States Air Force.  After active duty, I transfered to the Missouri Air National Guard in St. Louis, Missouri.  I enjoy the military very much.  As a family, my wife and I have been around the world.  We spent a year living in Germany, which was very cool.  The time there was very educational and gave us insight and respect for other cultures.  Since joining the Air National Guard, I have been to Turkey 3 times and a trip to Denmark.  The diversity of the different cultures was enlightening.  I enjoyed learning how the people in other countries that I have visited lived, worked, and what they do for recreation.</FONT>
