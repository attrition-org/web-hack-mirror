<p align="center">No, there isn't much of anything to like about Lowell, so you shouldn't
be fooled by the picture it did show on this site.</p>

<p align="center">The high school of this godforsaken town is pitiful. The town paper
needs some new editors or something cause they always screw up on simple things like name
spellings. Not to mention all the rich kids who think they are better than other people.
Lowell is almost as queer as Dracut.</p>

actually see Lowell, rent the HBO special called &quot;High on Crack Street&quot; at your
local Video Rental Store, which tells a nice story for all members of the family about
Lowell Massachusetts.</u></em></strong></font></p>
