  killed in Valley SRINAGAR,</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Sept 5: 
  Eight Mujahideen were among 10 killed in occupied Kashmir on Tuesday. Four freedom 
  fighters were shot dead by Indian guards near the holy town of Chrar-i-Sharif, 
  a Border Security Force official claimed. He added that earlier a BSF guard 
  was killed and five others injured in a grenade attack in Srinagar. The firefight 
  erupted at Tilsar, on the outskirts of Chrar-i- Sharif, after the BSF guards 
  ringed the area to trap Mujahideen. "During the two-hour encounter, one militant 
  (Mujahid) was killed, while three others managed to escape. However, we chased 
  them and engaged them in a gunbattle at a neighbouring village and eliminated 
  all three," Singh said. Singh added that two of the four Mujahideen had been 
  identified and belonged to the Hizbul Mujahideen. It was the first major encounter 
  between the Hizb fighters and the Indian forces since the Hizb called off its 
  ceasefire on Aug 8. Four more freedom fighters were killed in three encounters 
  in the Baramulla, Budgam and Poonch districts since Monday evening, police said.-AFP 
  Two injured in Indian firing SIALKOT, Sept 5: Two villagers were critically

  son of Mohammad Shafi and Rehmat Ali (35) son of Shahdin, were sitting in their 
  homes, when the Indian bullets hit them, injuring them severely. According to 
  the latest reports, the Indian security forces continued firing on Pakistani 
  villages on Tuesday. </font></p>
