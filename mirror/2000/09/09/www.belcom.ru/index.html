<p><font color="#FFFFFF">SRINAGAR, Sept 8: A three-year-old Muslim boy
was among six killed in violence in occupied Kashmir on Friday, police
said.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Police said a suspected Kashmiri freedom fighter
barged into a house at a village about 90 kilometers north of Srinagar
and opened fire, killing a man and his three-year-old grandson. "Wasim
was sitting with his grandfather when masked gunmen forced their entry
into the house and opened fire," a police spokesman said in Srinagar. Police
said the same men re-appeared in the village two hours later and shot dead
another civilian, Mohammad Yaqoob Khan.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Security forces later sealed the village and started
house-to-house search, a police spokesman said. He said freedom fighters
shot dead Nazir Ahmed, the brother of an official in Kashmir's ruling National
Conference party in Srinagar. There were no claims of responsibility from
any freedom fighters groups.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Two Mujahideen were shot dead by security forces
in separate encounters in the Baramulla and Rajouri districts of occupied
Kashmir, the police spokesman said. Meanwhile, gunmen shot two women in
the legs in a beauty parlor in Srinagar on Friday, a day after a Mujahideen
group reportedly issued a diktat forcing Islamic dress codes on women.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The two gunmen, who raided the privately-owned
Shehnaz Beauty Parlor in Srinagar's Gunikhan district, also shot Mohammad
Mohsin Sulemani, a male worker, officials from a local police station said.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The attack came a day after the Press Trust of
India said the Lashker-i-Toiba had threatened to shoot Muslim women in
the legs if they refused to conform to Islamic dress codes, including the
wearing of veils.-AFP</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Is, this what we call human rights? killing a
three year old boy? Imagine if that boy was related to you? Would you take
this nonsense bullshit from the Indians? STOP it Indians and US stop the
cold shoulder on the issue, UN move your fat asses and work on the issue
