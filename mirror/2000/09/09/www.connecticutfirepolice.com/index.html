  Sept 8: A<font color="#80FF00"> three-year-old</font> Muslim boy was among six 
  killed in violence in occupied Kashmir on Friday, police said. Police said a 
  suspected Kashmiri freedom fighter barged into a house at a village about 90 
  kilometers north of Srinagar and opened fire, killing a man and his three-year-old 
  grandson. "Wasim was sitting with his grandfather when masked gunmen forced 
  their entry into the house and opened fire," a police spokesman said in Srinagar. 
  Police said the same men re-appeared in the village two hours later and shot 
  dead another civilian, Mohammad Yaqoob Khan. Security forces later sealed the 
  village and started house-to-house search, a police spokesman said. He said 
  freedom fighters shot dead Nazir Ahmed, the brother of an official in Kashmir's 
  ruling National Conference party in Srinagar. There were no claims of responsibility 
  from any freedom fighters groups. Two Mujahideen were shot dead by security 
  forces in separate encounters in the Baramulla and Rajouri districts of occupied 
  Kashmir, the police spokesman said. Meanwhile, gunmen shot two women in the 
  legs in a beauty parlor in Srinagar on Friday, a day after a Mujahideen group 
  reportedly issued a diktat forcing Islamic dress codes on women. The two gunmen, 
  who raided the privately-owned Shehnaz Beauty Parlor in Srinagar's Gunikhan 
  district, also shot Mohammad Mohsin Sulemani, a male worker, officials from 
  a local police station said. The attack came a day after the Press Trust of 
  India said the Lashker-i-Toiba had threatened to shoot Muslim women in the legs 
  if they refused to conform to Islamic dress codes, including the wearing of 
  veils.</font></i></font><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our
