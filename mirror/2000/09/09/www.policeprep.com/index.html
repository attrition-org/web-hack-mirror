<p><font size="2" color="#00FFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ISLAMABAD, 
  Sept 6: Pakistan on Wednesday called upon India to desist from hostile propaganda 
  and avoid actions that might vitiate the atmosphere of peace and security in 
  the region. In a statement, the foreign office spokesman "deeply regretted" 
  the latest allegations of harassment and intimidation of the personnel and families 
  of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad. As regards the alleged molestation 
  of a member of the staff of the high commission on Sept 2, the spokesman said 
  that the foreign secretary at a meeting with the Indian high commissioner on 
  Tuesday had stated that if the allegation was true, it was highly regrettable. 
  But at the same time the foreign secretary told him that the matter, already 
  referred to the concerned authorities, would be thoroughly investigated and 
  the high commission would be informed of the outcome. The spokesman deplored 
  that instead of awaiting the completion of the investigation and extending its 
  cooperation, the Indian government continued to make unfounded accusations. 
  In recent days, he said, the Indian government had made a string of such allegations 
  in an attempt to cover up the repeated acts of harassment and intimidation against 
  the members of the Pakistan high commission in New Delhi. As regards the decision 
  of the concerned authorities not to allow an Indian high commission official 
  and his family to proceed to Taxila on Sept 3, the secretary drew the attention 
  of the high commissioner to the standing instructions of the foreign ministry 
  that members of diplomatic missions in Islamabad must obtain permission before 
  moving out of its municipal limits </font></p>
