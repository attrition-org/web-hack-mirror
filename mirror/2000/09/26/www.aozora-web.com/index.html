<!-- 
• Try the official fux0r shot! 
requirements:
a.] Irish Creme Whiskey (none of the real cheap shit either...
b.] A lil bit of milk
c.] A Fresh Lemon
-
directions: 
1.] Mix drink 5/6 Irish Creme, 1/6 milk
2.] Find unknowing friend and make him take the shot, holding it in his mouth.
3.] With the shot waiting in the shooters mouth immediately make them bite and 
suck on a big piece of fresh lemon. and hold it for a sec..
-
synopsis: the lemon will force the creme shot to curdle in the shooters mouth, filling it with a bunch of weird goopy shit.
sometimes resulting in hilarious & instaneous volatile vomitting... hence, fux0r shot..

heh, well hey whattup there website viewer person thinga muh person...
you just became a statistic, but wait so you get the full effect
OoOoOhH YyOuUu GOtTs HaXoReD.. but i hope you dont be to very 
impressed with the elitile haxor lingo, cuz that shit ain't my
ponejammeh. besides i'm not a haxor, in fact i don't know what
the hell i'm doing, or how this thing got here, but that's ok because
of the size of my <a href="http://www.jps.net/testcase/nuts.mpeg">manly haxor unit</a>,
& hey i know<br>
#!/usr/bin/perl<br>
print "Hello World!\n";<br>
so you better like do that whole fearing thing all those evil haxor
fella's are always talkin bout... neways i was just sittin here
playin with my elitile auto-thinga-muh-jigger, and i said, welp
since i'm such a nice guy i think i'm gonna go share my uber-kewl
.bat funny thingy with some nbsession waiting aol'r and give them
a nifty jewel thingy so that they could play with my elitile auto-
thinga-muhjigger too because like i said, it is kewl. and then they
can spread the fux0r luv so i donts haves too. so feel luv'd i mean
i went all outta me way to install something you got force fed anyway.
well that and the fact that it just adds to the laugh that we have
when you finally figure out the conglomor4ts are the real reason this happened..
but whoa gawl damn, dont it make ya's wonders? how many lil evil
haxor guys out there that dont luv you like we do? i mean we dont hurt,
just have a lil fun, ok so we might de-virginize your fine young daughters,
but saying your in fux0r seems to make the panties moist, what can ya do?
anyway yes people spend all sorts of money, time, patience and whatever tryin to
poop on our grewve, but its only to draw your attention from how they
got through. instead of fixing the problems and creating a standard,
they want to run around and blame someone for showing that they flubbed
up. i mean hey, we didnt code this shit, and i'm sure it could have been
prevented, but what would we know.. i mean you guys are the experts right?
that is until your punk ass's get 0-day'd and you just dont want to deal..
yet upon too many a site i see to many a false assuring seal. showing that
things have been taken into consideration when really they're not.. anyway
if we're capable of finding the things that we do, ya think there might
just be a chance <i>something</i> might have slipped by <b>you</b>. which is ok, no
one is perfect, thats why we're here, to educate & inform, so theres no
need to fear. just take into consideration, the masses right now, scanning
your ip for dumb sploits found by other people so they can loot & pileage.
some are actually maliscious believe it or not and would violate you in a second,
just to gain a credit card number or something to keep their porn memberships active...
anyway we thought we'd bring your attention to it in this nifty way, but that's
just the way things are in these days and age..

-i had a member of one of the larger/popular grewps ask why they never see me on the main
evil haxor channels on irc. i dunno i guess i have 'interesting character' and they
wanted to talk to me.. well it once used to be, an invitation was customary, so hell
if you want, i'll come spit my skizmflop, but i'm warning you now, i'm just so gawd
damn lovable you may not want me to leave, but sooner or later i'll have to go pee...
heh, but as the rest of the fux0r team will agree, need twisted, perverted, de-ranged
amusement good for hours on end? well hell that's my ponejammeh... and i do hang on irc, quite a bit in fact,
just not in the uberkewl channels, but a majority of them are logged by mr. man bots anyway, &
that i can't handle, but i do visit from time to time, and jesus fucking christ why does
this keep coming in rhyme...<br>

admin: nothing harmed in anyway, just bringing your attention to a flaw which
allowed me to deface your website, might as well have been me, because i dont
hurt anything. no grudges held, don't lose your buzz, all is well. if ya think
about it i'm sure you'll see this probably could have been prevented, but who 
knows...
anyway have a nice day, and remember fux0r luvs yew...
