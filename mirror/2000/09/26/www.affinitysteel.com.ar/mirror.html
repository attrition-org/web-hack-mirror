<b>The reason behind this defacement is because I want everyone to hear this song. Have you ever heard that <a href="http://www.aperfectcircle.com/">A Perfect Circle</a> song called Rose? It's cool as fuck.

Don't disturb<br>
The beast<br>
The tempermental goat<br>
The snail while he's feeding on<br> 
the Rose<br>
Stay frozen, compromising<br>
What I will<br>
I am<br><br>
Bend around<br>
The wind silently<br>
blown about<br>
Again I'm treading so<br>
Soft and lightly<br>
Compromising my will<br>
I am<br><br>
I am<br>
I will<br>
So no longer<br> 
Will I <br>
Lay down <br>
Play dead<br>
Play your doe<br>
in the headlights shut down<br>
and terrified <br>
Your deer in the headlights<br>
locked down and horrified when<br>
Push comes to pull comes to shove<br>
Comes to step around this<br>
Self-destructing dance that never<br> 
would've ended till I <br>
Rose,<br>
I roared aloud here<br>
I will<br>
I am.<br><br>
I am<br>
I will<br>
So no longer<br> 
Will I <br>
Lay down <br>
Lay dead<br>
Play this <br>
Kneel down<br>
Gun-shy Martyr<br>
Pitiful <br>
I rose, I roared<br>

<b>Another issue plagues my mind. Welfare. I know that a lot of people need welfare, and can't get a job for whatever reason, and welfare is good for those people. But some of you people on welfare don't need that shit. I know some people on welfare and they have over $800 in their food stamp account. Plus the man and his wife both have jobs. What the fuck is that? I don't even have $800 in my fucking savings account! These people are getting a fucking free ride from the government, when all I get are bills for the IRS, because I didn't pay enough taxes. That's fucked up. There are lots of people on welfare that don't need to be. Some are healthy young men that "can't" (don't want) to get jobs. I have to work my ass off, 5 days a week, just like everyone else should (unless it's IMPOSSIBLE). I don't mean to offend anyone, I'm just trying to open the minds and hearts of people. Later.</b>

<!-- Fucks go to: dumbass Sneed, dumbass 80m (80 morons for those that don't konw), Ti|| deserves a big fuck you! He's posting false claims of things people say. He's trying to act like he's elite or some shit by talking shit about someone else. He's talking shit about pimpshiz, myself and has threightened to talk shit about others, however lame that sounds. He's taking 'documentaion' of what other people and I say, then he puts the senteces on a webpage, scrambled up so no one knows how much of loser he really is, trying to make that person look stupid. Ti|| is in this group called RTFM (Retards That Fuck Monkeys) and he's upset because he can't deface, so he talks shit about other people that can/do deface. 
And fuck everyone else that deserves a fuck, you dumb fucks. --!>
