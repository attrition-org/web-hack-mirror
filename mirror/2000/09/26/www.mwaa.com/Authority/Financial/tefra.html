  The public hearing shall also concern the issuance of refunding bonds, which 
  may be issued to refund any or all of the revenue bonds, or other bonds or obligations 
  of the Authority, the proceeds of which were used to finance the projects described 
  above. The aggregate principal amount of refunding bonds shall not exceed $1,858,050,000

  interest of the revenue bonds, or other bonds or obligations to be refunded 
  and cost of issuing refunding bonds.

  The Authority presently anticipates funding these projects through a combination 
  of Authority funds, proceeds of bonds, including previously issued bonds, additional 
  bonds to be issued on a parity with other previously issued bonds, the proceeds 
  of bond anticipation notes and short term commercial paper, federal grants, 
  passenger facility charges and the investment earnings on the proceeds of all 
  such financing vehicles. The Authority expects to issue revenue bonds or refunding 
  bonds at different times in several series of different amounts, with the timing, 
  amounts, and number of issues depending on the needs for funds and market conditions. 
  The Authority expects to issue bonds at various times over the next 3 years. 
                                                                        <b>As required by the Acts creating the Authority, the obligations will not 
  pledge the credit of the Commonwealth of Virginia or any political subdivision 
  thereof or the District of Columbia, but will be payable solely from revenues
