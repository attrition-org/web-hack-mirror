do you know what i find just completely fucking hilarious? do you?<br>
welp see, it all starts with our good friends, whom we will refer to as
the conglomor4ts. let's say an anxious to make a buck corporation decides
on a new product that they're convinced that <b>you</b>, will buy like hell
once you see just <i>how much it can help</i> <b>you</b>... so of course
like all r4ts do they scurry around in a race for the cheese, slapping together
whatever product will bring them their cheese. as long as it works seems to
be the adopted mentallity ::cough::y2k::cough:: heh. anyway, so once again we
join our r4ts as they scurry around some more to market their product, mass
advertising initiatives with promises of compatability & ease of use, which
of course is immediately snatched up by the innocent and unaware consumer who might just not know any
better and are just taking what their fed. soon the market is saturated with
a product potentially very harmful to its users due to 'minor formalities'. 
next thing you know someone actually takes a second to look at the product,
they find things of interest such as ways of personal gain and decide to further
investigate. ooops, they've found a hole which allows them to compromise the
product system in a matter of seconds and do whatever the hell they want. next 
thing you know the conglomor4ts get word one way or another and decide they better
try to cover their ass, so they release a new version of the product that's
just as fucked up as the one before it with the exception of a few flaws which
are bound to be replaced with new ones as their found and <i>reported</i> anyway.
so now the conglomor4ts are angry, i mean after all, if the bugs would quit being
found there wouldnt be any problems right? seems logical enough right? so
in order to further protect they're ass's they bring in the law and create some
laws and start busting people for 'hacking'. because after all, they can't allow
the idea that there may be <i>other</i> people out there who may try to get that idea.
so in a way to basically say 'hey your in trouble cuz yer not supposed to be
showing people that are product is all fucked up' they try to lay blame on someone
else once again to divert the attention to the fact that they flubbed up and
make everyone concentrate on the person that clowned them. for example, the mpaa shit
going on with the DeCSS scheme to allow for some extra dvd options that should be offered
with the product anyway instead of trying to limit it in order to make more money, its their own fucking faults.
i mean do you really think about busting people makes up for their slack? well that seems to be the
conclusion alot have come too.. for example, win 2k was released with over 60,000
documented bugs. thats right, i didnt typo an extra zero. then you could also take a look
back at their last products which obviously arent too grand and is still a staple in
the industry. their slack and others in the industry leave far too many victim due
to their <i>minor formalities</i>. believe it or not, many dont want to have to
worry about who has what could be very personal, sensitive information of theirs. 
now of course there are also those crusaders whom instead of running silent in the shadows
resist in these actions by leaving a big attention grabbing point somewhere where it will
not be ignored and attention is required, not a <i>minor formality</i>. there are too
many vulnerabilities on the net which allow those with a <i>genuine</i> maliscious
intent to compromise systems on mass scales. and that's only the internal, nowadays
information security is, or should be a prime concern. since the birth of the fbi's
isp based data gathering & monitoring utility known as <b>carnivore</b>, and the confirmation
of the existence of an international data monitoring & processing network known as <b>echelon</b>
now more than ever <b>your</b> attention and voice is in need. but no, do not let your head
immediately fill up with thoughts of international conspiracies and the sort (though thought never hurts)
but in doing so you might just look right past other factors, such as conglomor4ts and their spy software.
for example, comet cursor, globalescape, real networks, and many, many other slapnuts automatically
install 'spy programs' which discreetly transmit personal information from whatever machine installed on.
documentation and and app that can remove known one's on win32 can be found at <a href="http://www.grc.org">www.grc.org</a>. Ok, so we got some drama, got some suspense, lets go for some anger and disgust now when i tell
you that programs you download may not be the only thing sending off information from your machine without
your knowing or consent. see, in all copies of the microsoft windows 98, 98se and possibly a couple others.
their resides rsa keys which can be found and replaced in your registry, but they transmit info. about you,
and your machine all the time, and you never know. as a project initiated by the r.s.a. & adopted without
struggle by microsoft and so grasciously included in the operating system package <b>you</b> as
statistics have been showing, are probably using to view this right now. wanna read more? shit me too!
i can think of one link for that nsa key info which is <a href="http://www.hotmanscave.com">www.hotmanscave.com</a>.
now for some reason, call me crazy, but i dont think the's things <i>just go away</i>. escpecially if you
take into consideration the relevance of such circumstances in the future. as many know ipv6 is gonna be
adopted a little ways down the road which only heightens the need for attention to the subject. imagine it,
8x1017 to 2x1033 nodes, assuming efficiency in the same ranges as the other architecture. anything from dildo's
to microwaves could be hooked up to the net, exposing themselves to the world. then through past experiences
of social engineering my instinct is going to tell me that people arent always as inclined to be the nice guy
and report harmful flaws of systems to the proper channels as someone else might. which leads me, and should others as well,
to try and ponder the amount of undocumented <i>minor formalities</i> being used as we speak to lay victim to another
innocent soul. well it's all fine and dandy to think about it right, as long as it doesnt effect <b>you</b> right? <b><u>wrong</u></b>, you wont think its too funny when its someone you know, or even in fact is <b>you</b> and for your own good i bid you take heed to my words... 'modo cogito quid prosit rebus tuis et utinam logica falsa tuam philosophiam totam suffodiant!' an no, it ain't no español

admin: nothing harmed in anyway, just bringing your attention to a flaw which
allowed me to deface your website, might as well have been me, because i dont
hurt anything. no grudges held, don't lose your buzz, all is well. if ya think
about it i'm sure you'll see this probably could have been prevented, but who 
knows...
anyway have a nice day, and remember fux0r is your friend...
