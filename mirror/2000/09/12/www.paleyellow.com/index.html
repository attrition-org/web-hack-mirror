<H1>just got 0wned by the &obotz!!!</H1>

<CENTER>The &obotz are rookies on the scene, and I think that we deserve a little bit of props for a beautifully executed hack.  Anyhow, greetings to basically nobody, because until you get on the scene, people treat you like you were shit.  And that is just sad.  People, this is an elite brother/sisterhood that we are in... skillful hacking is all about respect, and service.  We actually are performing a service.  Granted, we're having some fun with it, but we're doing something important.  Let's end this rivalry bullshit, and make ourselves a lot stronger.<BR>
Fight for a brotherhood of hackers.</CENTER>
