<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since 1989, an estimated 
  40,000 Kashmiris have been killed by the Indian forces stationed in Kashmir.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">F</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">or 
  the last five years the people of the State have intensified their efforts in 
  order to invite the attention of the world community towards the "Kashmir Dispute", 
  though the people of the State had been fighting for their just cause peacefully 
  for the last forty eight years. Indian Government throughout these four decades 
  has been suppressing the people by illegal use of force, putting them into the 
  jails/ Interrogation centres etc. under draconian laws. Whenever any person 
  demanded holding of " Plebiscite", he has been put behind the bars. The Indian 
  Forces, stationed in Kashmir, have been given a free hand to kill any person 
  they choose. These powers have been given to them under the draconian laws like 
  "Disturbed Areas Act of 1990" and "Indian Armed Forces Act of 1990". Indifference 
  shown by world community to the miseries of people, have encouraged and given 
  a free hand to armed forces, to deal with the people, as they like. In October 
  1992, the Indian Armed forces started to intensify the killing of people immediately 
  after their arrest.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> These operations have been 
  carried out under the code name of "Operation Tiger", "Operation Eagle" and 
  "Operation Shiva". Now the armed forces have resorted to another policy of "Catch 
  and Kill" which means that no sooner a person is taken into custody, within 
  minutes he is brutally tortured and killed . The dead body is then thrown into 
  the street. In other cases, innocent civilians are arrested and taken to border 
  areas where they are shot. The Indian government then publicises that these 
  people were militants killed in armed encounters with the troops. It is common 
  practice for the paramilitary forces to walk into a quiet village/town and start 
  shooting indiscriminately, killing innocent and unarmed civilians -</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> all under the pretence 
  of crack-down operations against the Freedom-Fighters. In most cases, innocent 
  civilians are killed, women gang-raped and properties set on fire. Below is 
  a brief catalogue of the unjustified killings by the Indian troops in Kashmir. 
  This catalogue is by no means complete as thousands of killings go un-noticed 
  and undocumented. The list given below was compiled painstakingly by various 
  Kashmiri Human-rights activists, with great risks to their personal lives. </font></P>
