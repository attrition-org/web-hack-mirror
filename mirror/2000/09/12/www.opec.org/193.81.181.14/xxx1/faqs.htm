        What is OPEC?<br>
        </font>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</b>
        (OPEC) is a voluntary inter-governmental Organization
        that co-ordinates and unifies the petroleum policies of
        its Member Countries.<br>
        OPEC seeks to ensure the stabilization of oil prices in
        international oil markets with a view to eliminating
        harmful and unnecessary fluctuations, due regard being
        given at all times to the interest of producing nations
        and to the necessity of securing a steady income for
        them; an efficient, economic and regular supply of
        petroleum to consuming nations; and a fair return on
        their capital to those investing in the petroleum
        industry. <br>
        <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><a name="a2"></a>2. When
        was OPEC formed?<br>
        </b></font>OPEC was formed at a meeting held on September
        14, 1960 in Baghdad, Iraq, by five Founder Members: Iran,
        Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. <br>
        OPEC was registered with the United Nations Secretariat
        on November 6, 1962 (UN&nbsp;resolution No.6363). <br>

        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><a name="a3"></a>3. Who
        are the OPEC Member Countries?<br>
        </b></font>The OPEC Statute stipulates that: &quot;any
        country with a substantial net export of crude petroleum,
        which has fundamentally similar interests to those of
        Member Countries, may become a Full Member of the
        Organization, if accepted by a majority of three-fourths
        of Full Members, including the concurring votes of all
        Founder Members&quot;.</p>
        <p>The Statute further distinguishes between three
        categories of Membership: Founder Member, Full Member and
        Associate Member. Founder Members of the Organization are
        those countries which were represented at OPEC's first
        Conference, held in Baghdad, Iraq, in September 1960, and
        which signed the original agreement establishing OPEC.
        Full Members are the Founder Members, plus those
        countries whose applications for Membership have been
        accepted by the Conference. An Associate Member is a
        country which does not qualify for full membership, but
        which is nevertheless admitted under such special
        conditions as may be prescribed by the Conference.</p>
        <p>There are currently 11 OPEC Member Countries: </p>

        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><a name="a4"></a>4. How
        does OPEC function?<br>
        </b></font>Representatives of OPEC Member Countries
        (Heads of Delegation) meet at the OPEC Conference to
        coordinate and unify their petroleum policies in order to
        promote stability and prosperity in the petroleum market.
        They are supported in this by the OPEC Secretariat,
        directed by the Board of Governors and run by the
        Secretary General, and by various bodies including the
        Economic Commission and the Ministerial Monitoring
        Committee.<br>
        The Member Countries consider the current situation and
        forecasts of market fundamentals, such as economic growth
        rates and petroleum demand and supply scenarios. They
        then consider what, if any, changes they might make in
        their petroleum policies. For example, in previous
        Conferences the Member Countries have decided variously
        to raise or lower their collective oil production in
        order to maintain stable prices and steady supplies to
        consumers in the short, medium and longer term.<br>
        <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><a name="a5"></a>5. What
        is the OPEC Conference?<br>
        </b></font>The Conference is the supreme authority of the
        Organization, and consists of delegations normally headed
        by Their Excellencies the Ministers of Oil, Mines and
        Energy of Member Countries. The Conference generally
        meets twice a year, and in extraordinary sessions
        whenever required. It operates on the principle of
        unanimity and one Member, one vote. It is responsible for
        the formulation of the general policy of the Organization
        and the determination of the appropriate ways and means
        of its implementation.</p>
        <p>The Conference also decides upon applications for
        membership of the Organization, and on reports and
        recommendations submitted by the Board of Governors on
        the affairs of the Organization. It approves the
        appointment of Governors from each Member Country and
        elects the Chairman of the Board. Moreover, the
        Conference directs the Board to submit reports or make
        recommendations on any matter of interest to the
        Organization, and considers and decides upon the
        Organization&#146;s budget, as submitted to it by the
        Board.<br>

        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><a name="a6"></a>6. Who
        are the Heads of Delegation?<br>
        </b></font>The Heads of Delegation to OPEC are the
        official representatives of each Member Country to the
        OPEC Conference. The Heads of Delegation are therefore
        normally Their Excellencies the Ministers of Oil, Mines
        and Energy of Member Countries.<br>

        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><a name="a7"></a>7. What
        is the Board of Governors?<br>
        </b></font>The Board of Governors, or BOG, can be
        compared to the board of directors of a commercial
        organisation. The BOG is composed of Governors nominated
        by Member Countries and confirmed by the Conference for
        two years. The Board directs the management of the
        Organization; implements resolutions of the Conference;
        draws up the Organization&#146;s annual budget and
        submits it to the Conference for approval. It also
        decides upon any reports submitted by the Secretary
        General and submits reports and recommendations to the
        Conference on the affairs of the Organization.</p>
        <p>The role of the Board of Governors is discussed in
        Article 20 of the OPEC Statute (below).</p>
        <p>&quot;The Board of Governors shall:</p>

        is the Economic Commission?<br>
        </b></font>The Economic Commission is a specialized body
        operating within the framework of the Secretariat, with a
        view to assisting the Organization in promoting stability
        in international oil prices at equitable levels. The
        Commission is composed of a Commission Board, National
        Representatives, and a Commission staff, with the former
        consisting of the Deputy Secretary General, the National
        Representatives appointed by the Member Countries and a
        Commission Co-ordinator (who is ex-officio the Director

        </b></font>The Ministerial Monitoring Committee was
        established in March 1982 by the 63<sup>rd</sup>
        (Extraordinary) Meeting of the Conference. The MMC is
        chaired by the President of the Conference and comprises

        </b></font>The Ministerial Monitoring Sub-Committee was
        established in February 1993 by the Tenth Meeting of the
        Ministerial Monitoring Committee in order to monitor oil
        production and exports by Member Countries. The MMSC

        What is the OPEC Secretariat?<br>
        </b></font>The OPEC Secretariat functions as the
        Headquarters of OPEC. It is responsible for carrying out
        the executive functions of the Organization, in
        accordance with the provisions of the Statute and under
        the direction of the Board. <br>
        The Secretariat consists of the Secretary General, as
        chief executive, and a Research Division comprising a
        Director of Research, and the Data Services, Energy
        Studies and Petroleum Market Analysis Departments. Other
        departments include an Administration and Human Resources
        Department, a PR&nbsp;and Information Department, the
        Office of the Secretary General, and a legal office. <br>
        See a full list of <a href="officials2000.htm">Secretariat
        Officials</a>. <br>
        The Secretariat was originally established in Geneva in
        1961 but it was moved to Vienna in 1965. The 8th OPEC
        Conference (Extraordinary), approved the Host Agreement
        with the Austrian Government in April 1965, prior to the
        opening of the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna on September 1,
        1965. <br>

        Why does OPEC set oil production quotas?<br>
        </b></font>The OPEC Statute requires OPEC to pursue
        stability and prosperity in the petroleum market and we
        do this for the benefit of both oil producers and
        consumers.<br>
        To this end, OPEC Member Countries respond to market
        fundamentals and forecast developments by co-ordinating
        their petroleum policies. Production quotas are simply
        one possible response. If demand grows, or some oil
        producers are producing less oil, OPEC can increase its
        oil production in order to prevent a sudden rise in
        prices. OPEC might also reduce its oil production in
        response to market conditions in order to counter falling
        prices.<br>

        What is OPEC's current production ceiling?<br>

        Can an OPEC Member Country change its rate of oil
        production? <br>
        </b></font>OPEC is a voluntary Organization that aims to
        co-ordinate the production policies of its Member
        Countries through consensus decision-making.<br>
        Each Member Country retains absolute sovereignty over its
        oil production. Member Countries agree by unanimous vote
        on any such production ceilings and their allocation to
        the respective Member Countries. <br>
        <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
        <p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a name="a15"></a>15.
        Does OPEC control the oil market?<br>
        </font>No, </b>OPEC does not control the oil market. OPEC
        Member Countries produce about 40 per cent of the world's
        crude oil and 14 per cent of its natural gas.<br>
        However, OPEC's oil exports represent about 60 per cent
        of the oil traded internationally. Therefore, OPEC can
        have a strong influence on the oil market, especially if
        it decides to reduce or increase its level of production.<br>
        OPEC seeks stability in the oil market and endeavours to
        deliver steady supplies of oil to consumers at a
        reasonable price. OPEC seeks prosperity in the petroleum
        market for the benefit of both oil producers and
        consumers. OPEC has achieved this in a number of ways:
        sometimes by voluntarily producing less oil, sometimes by
        producing more when there is a shortfall in supplies
        (such as during the Gulf Crisis in 1990, when around
        three million barrels of oil per day were suddenly
        removed from the market). <br>

        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><a name="a16"></a>16.
        How does OPEC oil production affect oil prices?<br>
        </b></font>The oil and energy Ministers of the OPEC
        Member Countries meet twice every year to co-ordinate
        their oil production policies in light of market
        fundamentals, i.e. the likely future balance between
        demand and supply. The Member Countries, represented by
        their respective <a href="oilministers.htm">Heads of
        Delegation</a>, may or may not set production quotas
        during these regular Meetings and any extraordinary
        Meetings of the OPEC Conference. Given that OPEC is a
        major source of oil (see Q15, above), OPEC's decisions to
        increase or reduce production may lower or raise the
        price of crude oil. </p>
        <p>OPEC's impact on crude oil prices should be considered
        separately from the issue of changes in the prices of <i>oil
        products</i>, such as gasoline. There are many factors
        that influence the prices paid by end consumers for of
        oil products. In some countries taxes comprise 70 per
        cent of the final price paid by consumers, so even a
        major change in the price of crude oil might have only a
        minor impact on consumer prices.<br>
        <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><a name="a17"></a>17.
        How does OPEC influence world trade?<br>
        </b></font>OPEC is mostly involved in the oil market, but
        it has long been aware of the need for improvements in
        world trade. <br>
        Back in 1975, OPEC called for the creation of a new
        economic order based on justice, mutual understanding and
        a genuine concern for the well being of all people of the
        world. OPEC also called on the industrialised and
        developing countries to get together in order to solve
        the problems facing the poor countries and to look for a
        way to establish a better economic system by allowing
        more trade and more exchange of knowledge between
        developing and OECD countries. </p>
        <p>The OPEC Member Countries established the <a
        href="opecfund.htm">OPEC Fund For International
        Development</a> in 1976 in order to assist non-OPEC
        developing countries to improve their economies,
        including their trade. The OPEC Fund has so far committed
        itself to loans or grants totalling more than USD$4
        billion. The OPEC Fund has been active in many regions,
        including Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East
        and the Caribbean. The OPEC Fund has supported a range of
        different types of projects, from providing clean water
        and energy to remote communities, to building houses,
        schools, hospitals and roads and developing industry,
        farming and trade opportunities.</p>
        <p>OPEC also assists in other ways: by supporting
        developing countries' efforts to help themselves; by
        helping to remove trade barriers in individual countries
        and on an international level, for instance through the
        World Trade Organisation; and by helping the world to
        maintain a strong economic system, based on steady
        supplies of oil at a reasonable price. <br>
        OPEC cannot do this alone. It has been working hard to
        encourage other oil producers to co-operate in the oil
        market, and therefore to help preserve the balance of the
        world economy. <br>
        When these different countries finally realise that we
        all depend upon each other for trade, investment and a
        healthy life, then we shall all enjoy the full benefit of
        co-operation and improving economies, not only in the
        developing world, but in the industrialised world as
        well. <br>

        Does OPEC support environmental policies?<br>
        </b></font>OPEC supports sound environmental policies
        that are fair and equitable, based on proven needs and
        designed to address those needs. <br>
        OPEC is concerned about the environment and we want to
        ensure that it is clean and healthy for future
        generations. <br>
        OPEC also supports sustainable economic development,
        which requires steady supplies of energy at reasonable
        prices. Many countries have already introduced heavy
        taxes on oil products. In some countries, the price that
        motorists pay for gasoline is five times higher than the
        price of the original crude oil. Taxes account for 70 per
        cent or more of the final price of oil products in some
        countries. <br>
        As a result of these oil taxes, the oil consuming
        countries receive much more income from oil than OPEC
        does. <br>
        The G7 nations (US, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy,
        Britain and France) receive 70 per cent more income from
        oil taxes than the 11 OPEC Member Countries earn from
        their petroleum exports.<br>
        In 1996 G7 oil tax incomes totalled around US$270
        billion, while OPEC Petroleum Export Revenues were just
        $160 billion. Yet OPEC had to pay all of its costs from
        these revenues, so OPEC's Net revenue was more like $132
        billion, or less than half of the oil taxes levied on
        consumers by the G7.</p>
        <p>OPEC is concerned that many of the so-called 'green'
        taxes that are currently levied on oil do not
        specifically help the environment. Instead, the simply go
        into government budgets to be spent on other things.
        Taxes might lead to instability in the oil industry,
        creating problems for many countries and industries.<br>
        Industrialised countries are developing policies to limit
        the use of fossil fuels in order to reduce their
        emissions of Carbon Dioxide (CO<font size="1">2</font>).
        Many are already levying heavy taxes, particularly on oil
        products. Yet the OECD has discovered that its members
        could cut their Carbon Dioxide emissions 12 per cent by
        2010 and still maintain their tax revenues, if they adopt
        a <i>pro rata</i> tax system that levies tax on all forms
        of energy according to their carbon content.<br>
        OPEC is concerned that some countries may impose
        environmental and taxation policies that are harmful to
        those who rely on fossil fuels for a substantial part of
        their income. <br>
        Some countries with high oil taxes actually subsidise
        domestic coal production, yet coal produces more carbon
        dioxide (CO<font size="1">2</font>) than oil (carbon
        dioxide is a 'greenhouse gas' believed to contribute to
        global warming). </p>
        <p>OPEC is worried about discriminatory oil taxes because
        we are committed to providing a stable petroleum market. <br>
        We need to invest in oil exploration and development in
        order to have production capacity available as demand
        rises in the years ahead, but we also need to be sure
        that there will be enough demand for that oil and that we
        will get a reasonable price. <br>
        If we do not invest in expanding oil production capacity
        before it is needed, the world could face sudden price
        shocks, leading to serious global economic problems. </p>
        <p>OPEC is also concerned that many of the environmental
        policies now being proposed and adopted do not have the
        full support of the scientific community. There is still
        considerable debate about whether global warming really
        exists, and if it does what impact it will actually have,
        and how it can best be addressed. OPEC supports further
        research into these important issues. </p>
        <p>OPEC is also spending heavily to improve its
        environmental impact, by locating sources of higher
        quality oil and gas, by developing cleaner fuels for
        consumers, and by reducing the impact of its activities
        through safer, cleaner drilling, transportation and
        refining processes. </p>
        <p>OPEC also participates in many international meetings
        in order to remind governments and others who are
        debating environmental policies that they must consider
        the needs of developing countries, especially those that
        rely on their income from oil. <br>

        Can OPEC guarantee the security of oil supplies?<br>
        </b></font>Yes, in the right conditions, OPEC can provide
        an increasing amount of oil to meet the expected growth
        of global oil demand. OPEC currently produces about 40
        per cent of the world's crude oil, but that is forecast
        to grow to more than 50 per cent in the next quarter
        century.<br>
        OPEC has a policy of maintaining stability in the oil
        market, and its Member Countries have often done this by
        increasing or decreasing the amount of oil they produce.
        OPEC has the most spare oil production capacity, and this
        enables us to increase production at relatively short
        notice. However, because OPEC is not the only source of
        oil in the market, it cannot guarantee the movement of
        oil prices, or the availability of supplies to all
        consumers at all times. <br>
        OPEC has 77 per cent of the world's oil reserves, and
        this will enable us to expand oil production to meet the
        growth in demand. But in order to expand our output, we
        need to be sure that the oil industry will continue to be
        profitable. Oil producers invest billions of dollars in
        exploration and infrastructure (drilling and pumping,
        pipelines, docks, storage, refining, staff housing, etc.)
        and a new oil field can take 3-10 years to locate and
        develop. <br>
        If oil producers do not invest enough money and do it far
        enough in advance, then the world could face a shortage
        of oil supplies in future. <br>
        Therefore, OPEC is concerned about issues that undermine
        the prosperity of the oil industry and thus threaten the
        world's security of oil supplies. One such issue is oil
        taxation in the consuming countries. <br>
        Oil taxes reduce the incomes of oil producers, and limit
        the funds they have available for maintenance,
        exploration and production activities. <br>
        Oil taxes also limit the growth in oil demand and raise
        costs for other industries. As a result, oil producers
        and other investors are unsure of the future development
        of oil prices and profits, and they might hesitate from
        making the necessary investments. <br>
        Although OPEC does try to maintain stability and to
        invest in a timely manner, our efforts to guarantee the
        security of oil supplies can be undermined - or supported
        - by the actions of oil consumers.<br>
        <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><a name="a22"></a>22. Is
        there any need for security of oil demand?<br>
        </b></font>Yes, oil consumers need steady supplies of
        oil, and oil producers rely on steady demand. If demand
        changed suddenly it would have a major impact on the
        profitability of oil producers and the economies of many
        countries around the world. <br>
        Oil production is a long-term affair: the oil industry
        works 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, excluding
        maintenance or bad weather and other disruptions. Oil
        facilities require many millions of dollars of
        investment, and the investors try to earn a reasonable
        return on their capital.<br>
        A downturn in oil demand could force oil production to
        slow down or stop. This could physically damage the oil
        fields, reducing the amount of oil that can be recovered
        in future. The oil installations could also be damaged.
        Some facilities, such as those operating in the oceans,
        are very difficult and expensive to shut down. <br>
        When production slows down, oil producers might be forced
        to lay off staff. Downstream operators, such as gasoline
        retailers, refiners and transport companies, could also
        be forced to shed staff. <br>
        If oil producers receive lower incomes they must spend
        less money and import fewer goods from oil consumers. If
        investors are unsure about the risks and the likely
        returns from petroleum investments they may not make
        those investments. If we do not invest enough money, or
        do it far enough in advance, then the world could face a
        shortage of oil supplies and a downward spiral in the
        global economy.<br>
        However, if oil producers continue to receive reasonable
        prices and stable demand, they will maintain their
        production and invest far enough in advance to meet the
        growth of demand. <br>
        Thus the security of oil supplies relies upon the
        security of oil demand. Oil producers - and oil consumers
        - need to work together to ensure that the security of
        oil supply and demand are preserved.<br>

        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><a name="b5"></a>5. Do
        non-OPEC oil producers help support market stability?<br>
        </b></font>Historically, most non-OPEC producers have
        taken advantage of OPEC's voluntary production restraint
        by increasing their own production wherever possible. As
        a result, the market share of non-OPEC producers rose for
        a number of years, but oil prices fell and the markets
        were less stable than they could have been. <br>
        However, the situation improved in 1998 when seven
        non-OPEC oil producers cut their output, thus supporting
        OPEC efforts to restrain over-supply and help prices
        recover from a significant fall.</p>
        <p>Because it holds more than three-quarters of the
        world's oil reserves, OPEC is expected to play a growing
        role in stabilising the oil market over the longer term.
        OPEC will represent a larger share of the world's oil
        supplies and the market should therefore be more stable.<br>

        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><a name="b6"></a>6. Will
        oil remain the most important source of energy?<br>
        </b></font>Yes, OPEC forecasts that oil demand will
        continue to grow strongly and oil will remain the world's
        single most important source of energy for the
        foreseeable future. <br>
        OPEC forecasts that oil's share of the worldwide energy
        market will fall from almost 40 per cent in 1995 to less
        than 37 per cent in 2020. But oil will still be the
        world's single largest source of energy. The reduction in
        oil's market share is largely due to the stronger growth
        enjoyed by other forms of energy, particularly gas (see
        the table below).<br>
        <img src="Shares-2.gif" width="523" height="210"

        The amount of oil demanded worldwide is actually expected
        to rise, from around 70 million barrels per day in 1995

        the world running out of oil?<br>
        </b></font>Oil is a limited resource, so it may
        eventually run out, although not for many years to come.
        OPEC's oil reserves are sufficient to last another 80
        years at the current rate of production, while non-OPEC
        oil producers' reserves might last less than 20 years.
        The worldwide demand for oil is rising and OPEC is
        expected to be an increasingly important source of that
        oil. <br>
        If we manage our resources well, use the oil efficiently
        and develop new fields, then our oil reserves should last
        for many more generations to come.<br>
        <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><a name="b8"></a>8. What
        impact can OPEC have on industry?<br>
        </b></font>The economics of industry depends, in part, on
        its costs, of which a large part is represented by the
        cost of energy, such as gasoline or fuel oil. The cost of
        these oil products is affected by the price of crude oil,
        taxation and other factors. <br>
        The price of crude oil is influenced by the decisions
        taken by all oil producers, particularly the prices for
        which they are willing to sell and the quantities they
        are willing and able to supply. <br>
        If there is a shortage of oil supplies, then the price of
        oil will likely rise. This would have all sorts of
        implications for industry, such as higher transportation
        costs. Higher costs can lead to lower economic growth,
        and this will also impact on industry.<br>
        The OPEC Statute, written when OPEC was formed 1960,
        declares that OPEC is dedicated to providing a stable
        petroleum market, with steady supplies to consumers,
        reasonable prices and fair returns to investors in the
        oil industry. In pursuit of these aims, OPEC has for many
        years maintained a limit on the oil produced by its
        Member Countries. This has provided for a relatively
        stable oil industry, with reasonable prices. But OPEC is
        concerned that factors outside of its control may disrupt
        this stability. This includes taxation, which now
        constitutes the largest part of the price of oil products
        in some countries.<br>
        <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><a name="b9"></a>9. What
        investment is required for oil exploration and
        development?<br>
        </b></font>Oil exploration can cost tens or hundreds of
        billions of dollars.<br>
        The actual costs depend on such factors as the location
        of possible oil reserves (i.e. on land or in deep water),
        how large the oil field is expected to be, how detailed
        the exploration information must be, and the type and
        structure of the rock below the ground.<br>
        Exploration requires careful mapping of the surface in
        order to locate suitable sites (i.e. types of geological
        structures), deep formation surveys (e.g. with two and
        three-dimensional seismic techniques), and test-drilling.
        It is not easy to determine a typical cost of such
        activities. <br>
        OPEC has estimated that the oil industry could need to
        invest more than $100 billion in exploration and
        development between 1995 and 2000 in order to expand
        production capacity in line with the growth of demand.
        Oil demand is expected to grow from around 70 million
        barrels per day in 1995 to about 100 million barrels per
        day in 2020.<br>
        OPEC has the lowest average production costs in the oil
        industry. This is partly because some OPEC Member
        Countries have large amounts of oil in reasonably
        accessible locations. Yet OPEC still spend tens of
        billions of dollars meeting the growing need for oil.<br>

        How long does it take to discover oil and bring it to
        market?<br>
        </b></font>There is no standard answer to this question,
        but as a rule of thumb it can take 3-10 years from the
        decision to explore, through to discovery, testing,
        development and the delivery of oil from a new field. <br>
        The time required depends on where the oil is and thus
        how hard it is to discover, test and develop. <br>
        For instance, an offshore oil field in deep water can
        take much longer to discover and test, due to the
        challenging conditions such as bad weather. Drilling in
        deep water is also difficult, and it can be very
        expensive, so the explorers need time to raise the
        necessary money. <br>

        Will we ever see a repeat of the 1970s Oil Crisis?<br>
        </b></font>No. The 1970s oil crisis was a complex affair
        reflecting issues particular to that time and it is
        unlikely to ever be repeated.<br>
        Indeed, we all learned a lot from that experience. We
        know that if oil prices go too high or too low it will be
        harmful both to oil producers and oil consumers, both in
        the short- and long-term. <br>
        OPEC is dedicated to providing a stable oil market, with
        reasonable prices and steady supplies to consumers. <br>
        Consider the example of the Gulf Crisis in 1990, when
        production of about three million barrels of oil per day
        was suddenly halted, leading to a rapid rise in world oil
        prices. OPEC immediately held an extraordinary meeting
        and those Member Countries not involved in the Crisis
        decided to increase their oil supplies in order to cover
        for the shortfall from Iraq and Kuwait. As a result, oil
        prices stabilised and came down again to reasonable
        levels. <br>
        However, there is always potential for instability in the
        oil market. <br>
        OPEC continues to seek co-operation between oil producers
        and among producers and consumers. We need to work
        together to ensure stability. <br>

        What is the role of imported oil in industrialised
        countries?<br>
        </b></font>In 1996 one industrialised country, the United
        States, consumed almost 17 million barrels of petroleum
        products per day and it imported 7.7 million barrels of
        crude oil per day, or 46 per cent of its requirements.
        Forty two per cent of those oil imports came from OPEC
        Member Countries. <br>
        If an industrialised country such as the US stopped
        importing oil, many different people would be affected: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All of the oil importers (dock workers, import
                agents, etc.) would be out of work. </li>
            <li>Roughly half of the people working in the
                downstream oil industry (refining, distribution,
                retail sales) would lose their jobs. </li>
            <li>Prices would rise enormously. With only half the
                normal amount of oil being supplied, the price of
                oil would increase rapidly; let's presume the
                price of oil would double: </li>
            <li><ul>
                    <li>Many people would suddenly find it very
                        expensive to fill their cars with gas. </li>
                    <li>Many retail gas stations would close
                        (with workers losing their jobs), and
                        fewer people would buy new cars, leading
                        to further job losses. </li>
                    <li>The price of electricity would rise
                        (since many power stations burn oil and
                        gas). The cost of transporting goods
                        would be much higher, affecting
                        everything from bread and butter to
                        computers and clothing. </li>
                    <li>If people could not afford to buy so
                        much, more retail workers would lose
                        their jobs, as would farmers, factory
                        workers and truck drivers. </li>
                    <li>With more people out of work, there would
                        be less money spent on products and
                        services, and the situation would get
                        worse. It is not easy to predict how many
                        people would lose their jobs if the US
                        stopped importing oil. Presumably it
                        would be millions of people. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The impact would not be confined to the US alone, of
        course. Countries exporting oil to the US would lose a
        valuable source of income that supports many thousands of
        jobs. <br>
        And if the US economy started to suffer the problems
        outlined here, then the US could not afford to import
        many other products and services, thus creating problems
        for its trade partners around the world. <br>

        What causes low oil prices?<br>
        </b></font>Low prices of crude oil can be caused by a
        number of factors. Basically, it could be due to an
        imbalance between supply and demand - too much supply or
        too little demand. <br>
        Since 1974 OPEC Member Countries have formally adjusted
        their crude oil supplies in an effort to improve the
        balance between supply and demand. <br>
        OPEC's aim at all times is to maintain steady supplies of
        oil to consumers, while achieving a reasonable price for
        that oil. However, OPEC cannot be expected to achieve
        this on its own. <br>
        Most non-OPEC oil producers supply as much oil as they
        can. That makes it harder for OPEC to maintain stability
        in the oil market and it has meant that OPEC has lost
        market share and a lot of potential revenue. <br>
        If oil production rises faster than demand, then prices
        can fall and all of the oil producers will suffer. In the
        long run, consumers might also suffer if the oil industry
        is unprofitable and discourages investors. <br>
        <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><a name="b14"></a>14.
        What causes high oil prices?<br>
        </b></font>High crude oil prices could be due to a
        shortage of oil supplies. High prices for oil products -
        as purchased by end consumers such as motorists - are
        more likely to reflect other factors, such as taxation. <br>
        Crude oil prices react to the balance of demand and
        supply in the short term, and the rate of investment in
        the longer term. If investment is not made far enough in
        advance, oil supplies could be limited in the longer
        term, thus raising prices. Sentiment is also an important
        factor: if traders in the oil market believe there will
        be a shortage of oil supplies, they may raise prices
        before a shortage occurs. Other factors influencing the
        price of crude oil include accidents, bad weather
        (increasing demand, or halting transport of oil from
        producers), labour disputes (strikes) and other
        disruptions to production including war or natural
        disasters.<br>
        Crude oil now represents less than a quarter of the price
        of oil products in many countries. Therefore, taxes have
        more influence over the price of oil products. When oil
        taxes are raised, end consumers often mistakenly blame
        the oil producers, but it is really their own governments
        that are responsible. <br>
        OPEC seeks a stable oil market, without sudden price
        changes or excessively high or low prices. We regularly
        meet with other oil producers and with consumers in an
        effort to improve understanding and trust in the oil
        industry and to seek policies and measures that do not
        create unnecessary hardship for oil producers or
        consumers. <br>

        What happens if oil prices go up or down?<br>
        </b></font>The price of oil is very important to the
        world economy. <br>
        Oil accounts for roughly 40 per cent of all the world's
        energy. The world trade in fuels represents 7 per cent of
        total world merchandise trade and a third of the world
        trade in primary products. Energy is big business, and
        oil is a major part of that business. <br>
        The world lives on oil. Oil is the foundation for the
        plastics and petrochemical industries. Oil is fundamental
        to the welfare of the industrialised world and it is a
        major component of the farming industry. <br>
        The price of oil is reflected in most of the things we
        do. It impacts on the price of transport, the cost of
        goods and services, and the availability of many
        products, including food, water and shelter. <br>
        If oil prices are too high, then these goods and services
        become more expensive and economies experience inflation.
        Alternative forms of energy would also become more
        cost-competitive, but oil producers would eventually
        increase their supplies and prices would come back down. <br>
        If oil prices are too low, consumers would waste this
        non-renewable resource, investors would not be attracted
        to the industry and oil producers would suffer -
        especially the developing countries that produce oil,
        such as the OPEC Member Countries. If prices were too
        low, supplies would eventually fall until there was a
        price shock - leading back to inflation. <br>
        Oil prices that are too high or too low are clearly
        unhelpful for oil producers, oil consumers and the world
        at large. That is why OPEC makes quite sure that the
        market is not under-supplied with oil, forcing prices to
        go excessively high, and also that the market is not
        over-supplied so that prices go too low. It also speaks
        to other oil producers to encourage them to avoid
        over-supplying the market. It is also why OPEC talks to
        oil consumers to encourage them to adopt fair and
        equitable policies that do not discriminate against oil. <br>
        We would all suffer without steady supplies of oil at
        stable, reasonable prices. <br>
