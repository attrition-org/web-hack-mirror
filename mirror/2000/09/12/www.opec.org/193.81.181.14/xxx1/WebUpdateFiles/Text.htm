      <p><b><u>WHY YOU PAY SO MUCH FOR GASOLINE AND OTHER OIL PRODUCTS<br>
        </u><br>
        </b>Whenever the prices of oil products such as gasoline (petrol), diesel 
        or heating oil rise, OPEC is usually made the scapegoat by some sections 
        of the media, politicians and the general public. “OPEC must raise output,” 
        the cry goes up. This is based on the incorrect assumption that the Organization 
        is responsible for high product prices. The point has been made many times 
        before, but it is worth repeating: OPEC is NOT directly responsible for 
        high gasoline or heating oil prices. The following analysis shows why. 
      </p>
      <p>Most consumers believe there is a directly proportional link between 
        crude prices and the prices of products such as gasoline and heating oil. 
        If product prices go up, then it must be because crude prices are going 
        up. In other words, OPEC is perceived as being directly responsible for 
        high gasoline or heating oil prices. Nothing could be further from the 
        truth. Although there is a link between crude prices and product prices, 
        it is neither direct nor proportional, and the main reason can be summed 
        up in one word – TAXES. Of course, end users of petroleum products are 
        not being told the truth. </p>
      <p>These taxes imposed by the governments of the consuming nations vary 
        from country to country and region to region. Graphs 1-3 give a breakdown 
        of who gets what from a barrel of refined oil. <a href="Oil_Drop_EUswf.htm">Graph 
        1</a> shows that one of the regions with the highest levels of tax is 
        the European Union, where some 68 per cent of the final price is tax, 
        with 16 per cent going to refiners and marketers and the other 16 per 
        cent to oil exporters. <a href="Oil_Drop_G7swf.htm">Graph 2</a> shows 
        the situation in the G7, where 49 per cent of the price is tax, 26 per 
        cent goes to the refiners and marketers and 25 per cent to the oil exporters. 
        <a href="Oil_Drop_OECDswf.htm">Graph 3</a> gives details for the OECD 
        countries as a whole, where taxes account for 48 per cent of the final 
        price, refiners and marketers take 30 per cent and the oil exporters get 
        22 per cent. In each of these cases, OPEC and other oil exporters always 
        receive the lowest amount. </p>
      <p>A more detailed analysis of who gets what from a barrel of refined oil 
        is shown in <a href="composite_Barrel_1995-99.htm">Graph 4,</a> which 
        gives the breakdown of what is known as the ‘composite barrel’ in the 
        major consuming countries from 1995 to 1999. As in the previous graphs, 
        the price of a barrel of refined oil is split into three – the crude price, 
        the industry margin and taxes – to show who gets what. And in the vast 
        majority of cases, it’s clear that the biggest chunk of the cost of refined 
        barrel goes not to the oil-exporting countries, but straight to the governments 
        of the consuming countries in the form of taxes. Let’s take a closer look. 
      </p>
      <p>Firstly, the most obvious factor that these figures show is the huge 
        differences between what motorists pay for products such as gasoline in 
        the industrialised countries. When gasoline prices go up, OPEC often gets 
        e-mails from some consuming countries, especially the USA complaining 
        about high gasoline prices – which is ironic because the USA has the cheapest 
        gasoline in the industrialised world! Just compare, say, the cost of the 
        composite barrel in 1999 in the US ($43.9/barrel) with the cost in Japan 
        (more than double the US price at $91.4/b) or even with the average cost 
        in the European Union countries (higher still at $95.1/b!). So even in 
        the USA, where taxes are much lower than in the EU or Japan, the level 
        of taxation per barrel is still highly significant ($13.8/b). </p>
      <p>Secondly, if you’re a motorist in Europe or Japan, you have almost certainly 
        noticed that when crude oil prices fall, like they did to less than $10/b 
        in 1998-99, the price of gasoline doesn’t fall by a corresponding amount, 
        as you might expect. In fact, sometimes it keeps on rising! This graph 
        shows why: when crude oil prices fall, some of the industrialised countries 
        take the opportunity to increase taxes on gasoline, thus maintaining prices 
        at the same level or even higher. Let’s take the UK as an example. <a href="composite_Barrel_1995-99.htm">Graph 
        4</a> shows that UK prices for crude, which were $17.3/b in 1995, rose 
        to $21.1/b in 1996, then slumped to just $12.6/b in 1998, before rising 
        again in 1999 to $17.6/b. So you might expect that, if there were a direct 
        link between crude and product prices, gasoline prices would have followed 
        these fluctuations in crude prices. Not at all! Just look at the composite 
        barrel prices in the UK: in fact they rose constantly over the period, 
        from $109.1/b in 1995 to $127.1 in 1997 and further to $141.5/b in 1999. 
        The explanation is simple: every year, the UK Government increased its 
        taxation take on the refined barrel from $64.6/b in 1995 to $80.1/b in 
        1997 and then even higher to $96.1/b in 1999. </p>
      <p>Finally, if you think gasoline or heating oil is expensive, take a look 
        at <a href="The_Rip_off_Raceswf.htm">Graph 5</a>. This uses figures calculated 
        by US oil industry analysts John S Herold to show the cost of a barrel 
        of crude oil and gasoline compared to other consumer products such as 
        milk or mineral water. It turns out that gasoline is extremely cheap in 
        comparison with many popular consumer items. So, while consumers may complain 
        when the price of gasoline rises, those same consumers are happy to pay 
        prices for other products which, in per barrel terms, are way in excess 
        of what they pay for gasoline. The point remains, however, that governments 
        of some industrialized nations make from taxes at least three times what 
        oil exporters get from imported oil. Even with more crude oil in the market, 
        a significant reduction of these high taxes is what will lower the cost 
        of gasoline and similar products. We all know in whose court the ball 
        is. Think about it.</p>
