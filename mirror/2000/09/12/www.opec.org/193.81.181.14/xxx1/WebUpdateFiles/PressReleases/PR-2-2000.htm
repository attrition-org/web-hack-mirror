            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Excellencies, Ladies 
              and Gentlemen,</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&#9;Welcome to the 
              109th Meeting of the OPEC Conference, held at the OPEC Headquarters 
              in Vienna.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&#9;Among the distinguished 
              participants are two Ministers attending the OPEC Conference for 
              the first time as Heads of Delegation: His Excellency Chakib Khelil, 
              Minister of Energy and Mines of Algeria; and His Excellency Lieutenant-General 
              Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Minister of Mines and Energy of Indonesia. 
              We look forward to their contributions to our discussions. Let us 
              also remember, with gratitude, their predecessors and wish them 
              well for the future: Their Excellencies Dr Youcef Yousfi of Algeria 
              and Dr Kuntoro Mangkusubroto of Indonesia.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Excellencies, Ladies 
              and Gentlemen,</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&#9;Let us also welcome 
              our distinguished guests from the non-OPEC oil-producing countries. 
              They are: His Excellency Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos, Minister 
              of Petroleum of Angola, and his Delegation; His Excellency Dr Jorge 
              Chavez Presa, Deputy Minister of Energy Policy and Development of 
              Mexico, and his Delegation; His Excellency Dr Mohammed bin Hamad 
              Al Rumhy, Minister of Oil and Gas of the Sultanate of Oman, and 
              his Delegation; and His Excellency Viktor Kalyuzhny, Minister of 
              Fuel and Energy of the Russian Federation, and his Delegation. Their 
              presence here is a true consolidation of co-operation that was a 
              welcome feature of the oil industry at the end of the 20th century 
              which has done so much to stabilize the market over the past year.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&#9;The year 2000 is 
              special for OPEC. It marks the 40th Anniversary of the establishment 
              of our Organization, in Baghdad, Iraq, in September 1960. From humble 
              beginnings, as a group of five oil-producing developing countries, 
              our Organization today has progressed to become recognized --- and 
              respected --- as a major player in the world oil industry and market, 
              controlling more than three-quarters of the world&#146;s proven 
              recoverable crude oil reserves and more than half of world oil exports. 
              OPEC&#146;s contributions and role will continue to grow in the 
              decades to come.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&#9;OPEC is fully aware 
              of the need to keep up with a changing world. The Summit of OPEC 
              Heads of State, which is due to take place, God willing, in Member 
              Country Venezuela in September 2000, will provide an opportunity 
              to review, among other subjects, the objectives of our Organization 
              and its role in the oil industry during the 21st century. Undoubtedly, 
              recent oil market developments make the stability of the international 
              oil market an issue deserving special attention.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&#9;It will be useful 
              to remember that the annual average price of OPEC&#146;s spot Reference 
              Basket fell from US$20.3 per barrel in 1996 and $18.7/b in 1997 
              to only $12.3/b in 1998.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&#9;Output cuts undertaken 
              jointly by OPEC and some leading non-OPEC producers, and formalized 
              by the OPEC agreement of March 1999, quickly restored the price 
              to reasonable levels. Moreover, a continued firming of the market 
              until the end of the year resulted in an annual average for 1999 
              of $17.5/b.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&#9;The price continued 
              to rise this year due to different factors, some are fundamentals 
              and others are of local and speculative nature. Clearly, the price 
              extremes we witnessed in both ends in 1998 and the first few months 
              of this year are detrimental to the international oil market and 
              the world economy. In the final analysis, there are no winners from 
              this instability.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&#9;OPEC, as the leading 
              oil producers&#146; organization, has always been the stabilizing 
              force in world oil market. It has demonstrated its resolve to balance 
              the market at times of unwarranted surpluses or shortages. This 
              is in line with the very objectives of our Organization to bring 
              market stability and provide the world with adequate and timely 
              oil supplies.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&#9;However, OPEC and 
              the other oil-producing nations are not the only players in the 
              market. There are the governments of the oil consuming nations who 
              can also affect the market outcome, especially the prices of products 
              to the final consumer. Excessive product taxation in the consuming 
              countries, especially on gasoline, account for about 75 percent 
              of the final price to the consumer. In this regard, consuming countries 
              governments are called upon to co-operate with the producers and 
              lessen their tax burden on the final consumer.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&#9;Turning our attention 
              to the present oil market situation, the Heads of Delegation will, 
              at this Meeting of the Conference, carefully examine all the relevant 
              issues, with the objective of harmonizing the interests of producers 
              and consumers as quickly as possible. This will embody the assurances 
              of co-operation we have received from leading non-OPEC producers, 
              some of whom are represented here today.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Excellencies, Ladies 
              and Gentlemen,</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&#9;In closing, I wish 
              to confirm that OPEC&#146;s Member Countries remain totally committed 
              to the objectives stipulated in the OPEC Statute, namely the achievement 
              of security of supply, with reasonable prices for consumers and 
              fair returns for investors. These objectives constitute the foundation 
              upon which our Organization is built.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&#9;I thank you for 
              your kind attention, and wish you a successful meeting and pleasant 
              stay in Vienna.</font></p>
