	</p>
<p>Tripoli, 17 July 00 (OPECNA)--Continuous daily speculation 
in the futures market is the cause of the current volatility in 
the international oil market, it was stated here on Sunday.
	</p>
<p>Libyan Secretary of the National Oil Corporation Abdalla 
Salem El-Badri and visiting Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister 
Ali Rodriguez Araque said the hike in oil prices was not the 
result of market fundamentals.
	</p>
<p>The ministers, who met here along with the chairman of the 
Venezuelan Presidential Preparatory Commission for the Second 
OPEC Summit, Jorge Valero, emphasized their interest in having a 
stable oil market, free of any erratic behaviour, which was in 
the interest of producers and consumers alike.
	</p>
<p>In a press release issued today, the two sides said that, 
in order to achieve oil market stability, they would take action 
in coordination with other Member Countries of OPEC to 
"implement the understanding reached during the last Conference 
in June".
</p>
<p>	The release said Valero had briefed El-Badri on ongoing 
preparations for the OPEC Summit, to be held in Caracas, 
Venezuela at the end of September.
	</p>
<p>They also discussed bilateral relations and agreed to 
strengthen cooperation between the national oil companies of 
both countries in the fields of oil and gas.
	</p>
<p>Rodriguez is also president of the OPEC Conference, while 
El-Badri is Alternate President.
