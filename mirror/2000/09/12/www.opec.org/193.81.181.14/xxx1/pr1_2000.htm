                    Meeting of the Ministerial Monitoring
                    Sub-Committee, chaired by HE Bijan Namdar
                    Zangeneh, Minister of Petroleum of the
                    Islamic Republic of Iran, and with the
                    Membership of HE Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah,
                    Minister of Oil of the State of Kuwait; Mr.
                    Dahiru Adamu, Chargé d&#146;Affaires of the
                    Nigerian Embassy Austria; and HE Dr. Rilwanu
                    Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC, met at
                    Headquarters, Vienna, on Friday, 14 January
                    2000.&nbsp; HE Dr. Ali Rodriguez, Minister of
                    Energy &amp; Mines of Venezuela, also
                    attended the Meeting.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;The
                    Sub-Committee reviewed the Reports submitted
                    by the Secretariat on the monitoring of
                    Member Countries&#146; production and supply
                    for the period January to December 1999 and
                    on Oil Stocks, and considered presentations
                    given on the current oil market
                    situation.&nbsp; Whilst voicing overall
                    satisfaction with the level of adherence by
                    some Member Countries to the production
                    reductions agreed in March 1999, discipline
                    which has restored oil prices to more
                    acceptable levels, the Sub-Committee Members
                    urged even greater compliance by all OPEC and
                    non-OPEC producers concerned.&nbsp; In this
                    vein, cognisant of oil producers&#146;
                    responsibility to ensure the stability of
                    world oil markets in such a way as to
                    safeguard the interests of both consumers and
                    producers alike, the Members of the MMSC
                    repeated their conviction that strict
                    adherence to the agreed production restraint
                    by all concerned remained an imperative until
                    at least the end of March 2000.&nbsp; In
                    light of the continuing market volatility and
                    the remaining high stock levels, all those
                    present in the Meeting agreed to strongly
                    recommend to the Conference the extension of
                    the current agreement beyond that period.</font>
                    </p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;The
                    Sub-Committee agreed to convene again in
                    March 2000, immediately prior to the next
                    Ordinary Meeting of the Conference.</font> </p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;Finally,
                    the Chairman and Members of the Sub-Committee
                    thanked the Secretariat for its contribution
                    to the work.</font></p>
