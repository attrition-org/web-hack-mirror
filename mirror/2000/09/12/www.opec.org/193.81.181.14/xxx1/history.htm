            BRIEF HISTORY OF OPEC</strong></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">THE ORGANIZATION OF
            THE PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES is a permanent,
            intergovernmental Organization, created at the
            Baghdad Conference of September 10-14, 1960, by Iran,
            Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. The five
            Founding Members were later joined by eight other
            Members: Qatar (1961); Indonesia (1962); Socialist
            Peoples Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1962); United Arab
            Emirates (1967); Algeria (1969); Nigeria (1971);
            Ecuador (1973-1992)* and Gabon (1975-1994)*. OPEC
            transferred its headquarters from Geneva,
            Switzerland, to Vienna, Austria, on 1 September 1965,
            and moved into the present Secretariat building in
            1977.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;OPEC's
            objective is to co-ordinate and unify petroleum
            policies among Member Countries, in order to secure
            fair and stable prices for petroleum producers; an
            efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum
            to consuming nations; and a fair return on capital to
            those investing in the industry.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;The OPEC
            Conference of Ministers meets in ordinary session
            twice a year, and is responsible for the formulation
            of the general policy of the Organization.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 1990s</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the fifth Meeting
            of the Ministerial Monitoring Committee, held on
            16-17 March 1990, in Vienna, the Ministers reaffirmed
            their commitment to the November 1989 pricing and
            production agreement. On 2-3 May 1990, the Sixth
            Meeting of the Monitoring Committee, convened in
            Geneva to address the problem of over-supply in the
            oil market and the consequent deterioration in crude
            oil prices, unanimously agreed to take immediate
            collective action to cut back OPEC production by
            1.445 mb/d, the reduction to remain valid until the
            end of July 1990.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;The 87th
            Meeting of the Conference, held on 26-27 July 1990,
            in Geneva, after reviewing the oil market situation
            decided to make the minimum reference price for the
            OPEC crude basket $21/b, and that the total ceiling
            for OPEC production for the second half of 1990
            should be set at 22.491 mb/d. It was also decided
            that the Monitoring Committee should henceforth
            comprise all 13 OPEC Oil Ministers.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;On 8 August
            1990, the OPEC Secretariat issued a statement by HE
            Sadek Boussena, President of the Conference and
            Minister of Mines &amp; Industry of Algeria, in
            connection with the developments in the oil market
            following the outbreak of the Gulf crisis on 2
            August. The President said fears expressed concerning
            possible disruption of oil supply in the short term
            were the result of psychological and speculative
            factors rather than the manifestation of real market
            fundamentals. Nonetheless, OPEC was aware that the
            developments induced by the events in the Gulf were
            fraught with uncertainty as regards the equilibrium
            and stability of the international oil market, as
            well as the integrity of the Organization. OPEC would
            accordingly carefully monitor the evolution of the
            situation and assess its implications for world oil
            supply, for Member Countries' revenues and for the
            interests of both producers and consumers, and take
            whatever action was deemed necessary. HE Boussena
            stressed, however, that ensuring stability of supply
            to the market was the shared responsibility of all
            oil producers, the international oil industry, the
            consuming countries' governments and international
            energy agencies.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;On 26-28
            August 1990, informal consultations among OPEC Oil
            Ministers were held in Vienna. These discussions were
            immediately followed by a Meeting of the Ministerial
            Monitoring Committee (now comprising all 13 Member
            Countries) which decided in view of the need to
            maintain market stability and supplies to consumers,
            Member Countries would increase production &quot;in
            accordance with need&quot;. The Committee stressed,
            however, that this arrangement would be purely
            temporary, applicable only until such time as the
            Gulf crisis was deemed to be over. Thereafter, the
            Organization would revert to the terms of the July
            1990 Resolution. On 11 December 1990, in Vienna, the
            Committee held its second meeting and formulated its
            recommendations to the Conference.</font></p>

            24-25 September 1991, the Fourth Meeting of the MMC
            decided to raise OPEC's production ceiling to 23.65
            mb/d for the fourth quarter of 1991, as recommended
            by the Organization's Marketing Experts. With regard

            solidarity with the developing countries' request for
            the transfer of environmentally safe and sound
            technologies to foster efficient economic growth,
            adequate energy use, as well as to improve their
            environment and standard of living. The Committee
            expressed deep concern over the proposed energy tax
            being considered by the European Community, pointing
            out that oil was already disproportionately taxed at
            the consumption end, as a result of which consumers
            in Europe had been paying for the past three decades,
            petroleum taxes which were in some cases more than
            three times the delivered crude oil price. Any
            additional tax for environmental or other purposes,
            the Committee declared, would adversely affect free
            trade among nations, place oil at a comparative
            disadvantage in relation to all other energy sources
            and negatively affect the growth of the world

            the winter, which had led to a relatively low level
            of stock drawdown. In order to avert any further
            deterioration in crude oil prices, the Committee
            decided to reduce OPEC's overall production ceiling
            to 23.582 mb/d, with effect from 1 March 1993. Member

            contemplated by major consuming countries, would
            complicate investment decisions of oil producing
            countries in their efforts to expand production
            capacity to meet expected increases in oil demand. A
            new wave of oil taxes would have a destabilizing
            effect on the oil market and the future growth of oil
            demand and reduce oil producing countries' income and
            their ability to undertake their own share of the

            investments.</font></p>

            on production allocations and offered Kuwait an
            additional 10%, or a production level of 1.76 mb/d,
            an offer which Kuwait did not accept, insisting on a
            level of 2.16 mb/d. The effect of the June Agreement
            was that of a simple rollover. The Conference
            reiterated its commitment to the minimum reference
            price of $21 per barrel for the OPEC basket of seven
