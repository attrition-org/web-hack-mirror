So, what have I to say today? One word (or, more acurately, acronym) - MPAA. I say we replace our "democratic" leaders with the MPAA
and have done with the matter. We could save millions in court fees and get laws passed passed much faster than at present. Just think,
we could all live happily under the corporate machine, safe in the knowledge that we have no rights, purchases are merely extended leases
and free speech is in fact on loan from lawyers who now want it back. From this moment forward, you can now pay for your hard-earned 
personal memories in convenient monthly installments.<br><br>

I've copied the DeCSS source code to this server. Please download it and give it to your friends. If you deface a website, include it in
the defacement somewhere. If you email a friend, attach a copy. If you run a website, put it up for download. Lets try and avoid a situation
where mega-bucks corporations decide what we can and can't say; what we can and can't code; what we can and can't use. <br><br>

You can download <a href="decss.zip">DeCSS.ZIP</a> or <a href="decss.tar.gz">decss.tar.gz</a>. Alternatively, try the links in the frame
on the left(<a href="decss-links.html" target="_top">decss-links.html</a>). There are still <i>lots</i> of working mirrors.<br><br>

Admin: Your old index has been backed up... look for the most recent creation in your webroot. Also, I've not damaged your site at all.<br><br>
You'll note that in addition to your main server being open to attack, you have shares on all the machines in your domain that
are readable/writeable by any user with access to the LAN!!!!! That includes shares to the root of your filesystems (C: etc) and shares
mapped to your email directories.... bend over for a beating with the clue-stick. In case you haven't got the message, a compromise on
any computer on your LAN is a compromise of your entire network. I could have owned your DNS, webserver and email systems, including those
of all your clients. FIX THIS. Convenience is not worth the payoff.<br><br>
FYI, I used my LinSQL code to gain access to your site. The latest version is available <a href="linsql.c" target="_top"> here </a>. 
You can read a detailed explanation of the problem and some solutions <a href="explain.txt" target="_top"> here </a>.
