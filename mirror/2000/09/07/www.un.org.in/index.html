<br><b>NEW YORK, Sept 6:</b> Pakistan on Wednesday firmly proposed a no-war
pact and a mutual
<br>reduction in forces with India as General Pervez Musharraf told the
UN Millennium Summit his
<br>country was prepared to take "bold initiatives to change the status
quo".
<p>In his maiden speech to 152 heads of state and government, the chief
executive said he was prepared
<br>for a dialogue with India "at any level, at any time and anywhere.
Let me commit at this world forum
<br>that we desire a no-war pact; we are ready for a mutual reduction of
forces and we also seek a South
<br>Asia free from all nuclear weapons," Gen Musharraf said.
<p>His five-minute speech covered the Kashmir dispute in detail but he
also assured the international
<br>community that his regime was "sincerely committed to rebuilding and
strengthening the institutions of
<br>state to give the country a genuine and durable democracy."
<p>"Pakistan remains conscious of international concern for democracy,"
he said. "Our founding father
<br>Quaid-i-Azam envisioned Pakistan as a modern Islamic state, committed
to democracy based on
<br>equality, freedom and social justice. The people of Pakistan have never
lost faith in democracy, but
<br>autocracy in the garb of democracy led to dishonest governance and
the collapse of institutions."
<p>He said Kashmir and Palestine were two prime examples of festering disputes
where the UN charter
<br>had been defied. "Whereas the international community is seriously
engaged in finding a solution to
<br>Palestine, Kashmir cries for justice even after 52 years," he pointed
out.
<p>He said South Asia was deprived of economic progress because Kashmiri
people remained deprived
<br>of justice. "The consequence of this injustice has been four wars,
the region stands heavily militarized
<br>and nuclearized."
<p>The CE clarified that this situation was not to his country's making.
"We have been obliged to respond
<br>to the compulsions of our security and have merely acted in self-defence."
<p>He stressed that Kashmir had to be resolved as 10 million people cannot
be denied their fundamental
<br>right to self-determination. "The savage brutalities and killing of
70,000 people by 700,000 troops
<br>have only hardened their resolve. They seek honoring of the pledges
made by the UN. If the people
<br>of East Timor can be given their freedom, why not people of Kashmir?
When one party is intransigent
<br>in rejecting the use of peaceful means, the Security Council is empowered
to act. The problem lies not
<br>in the UN charter but in the lack of political will. Until we produce
that will, all talk of crisis prevention
<br>and dispute resolution will ring hollow."
<p>Gen Musharraf also spoke about corruption in Pakistan and attacked the
western countries in tough
<br>words for what he called "encouraging corruption. We have heard long
lectures on democracy from
<br>countries which have laws that actually encourage corruption by giving
ready asylum to plunderers and
<br>facilities for concealment of illicit wealth in secret accounts in
their banks," the CE said.
