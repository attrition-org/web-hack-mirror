<p>Srinagar,
<br>September 13:
<p>The Indian forces baton charged and resorted to firing at the Hurriyat
<br>Conference anti-polls team, led by Muhammad Yaseen Malik and comprising
<br>Ghulam Nabi Sumji, Advocate Bashir Ahmed Butt and Sheikh Ali Muhammad,
as soon as it reached Bejbehara, injuring a large number of people. The
troops
<br>manhandled Muhammad Yaseen Malik and his two dozen companions and tore
their clothes. They were then arrested and put in police lockup. Instantaneously
<br>life came to standstill in Bejbehara and strike was observed in protest
<br>against the inhuman treatment of the Hurriyat leaders. Thousand of
people
<br>took out a procession, chanting slogans against India and in favor
of Azadi.
<br>The Chairman of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, Syed Ali Shah
Gilani,
<br>who, along with almost 20 Hurriyat leaders, had been arrested a week
ago
<br>when he was carrying on anti-polls campaign in Kupwara, has been shifted
<br>from Uri Baramula to Nageen police station lock up in Srinagar under
tight
<br>security. Other prominent Hurriyat leaders, Muhammad Ashraf Sehari,
Ghulam
<br>Ahmed Gulzar, Abdul Ahad Waza, Musarrat Alam and Ghulam Muhammad Sinkara
are still in police custody.
<br>The president of Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Front, Pandit Bhoshan
Bazaz
<br>has lodged a strong protest against the continued detention of All
Parties
<br>Hurriyat Conference leaders and termed it the result of the Indian
Rulers'
<br>frustration at the Kashmiris' complete boycott of elections to the
Lok
<br>Sabah. A spokesman of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference while condemning
<br>the arrest and continued detention of the Hurriyat leaders, said that
the
<br>anti-polls campaign will not be affected by such ruthless measures
adopted
<br>by the Indian rulers.

<p>By CHRISTOPHER KREMMER, Herald correspondent in New Delhi
<p>India's elections - the third in just over three years - have been
<br>called the polls nobody wants, and nowhere is it truer than in the
<br>disputed State of Kashmir.
<p>When people in the Kashmir Valley voted last Sunday, about one in five
<br>polling booths recorded a zero voter turnout.
<p>Today, voters in parts of the State outside the Valley get their chance,
<br>but the spectre of violence and a boycott call by separatists
<br>overshadows the polls.
<p>The only vote separatists are interested in is a United
<br>Nations-supervised plebiscite on self determination in India's only
<br>Muslim-majority State. The scenes of violence from East Timor after
<br>completing a similar exercise have not deterred them.
<p>Despite a 10-year insurgency in which at least 25,000 people have died,
<br>New Delhi says a vote in state and national elections is
<br>all they will get.
<p>That has led to the boycott call by the umbrella body representing those
<br>in favour of independence or accession to neighbouring
<br>Pakistan, the All Party Hurriyat Conference (APHC). At 182 polling
<br>booths in the Srinagar constituency last Sunday, not a single
<br>vote was recorded, leaving 910 officials to seal empty ballot boxes.
Not
<br>even party workers cast ballots.
<p>But the massive stay-away owed as much to fear of revenge attacks by
<br>separatists against anyone who defied the boycott, as it
<br>did to support for the separatist cause.
<p>On Tuesday, the extremists lent weight to such fears, triggering a land
<br>mine explosion in Anantnag constituency which killed the
<br>candidate of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Mr Ghulam Hyder
<br>Noorani, and led to the poll there being abandoned. On
<br>Thursday, a grenade was thrown at another BJP vehicle in Doda Town,
180
<br>kilometres from the State capital, Jammu. Eleven
<br>people were injured.
<p>India has accused Pakistan of arming and training more than 1,000
<br>separatist militants who have infiltrated the State this year.
<br>Tensions between the neighbours sparked a two-month undeclared war
in
<br>the Kargil region in May, which left more than 1,000
<br>soldiers killed.
<p>"Pakistan does not want elections in Kashmir and hence it is creating
<br>hurdles," India's caretaker Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari
<br>Vajpayee, told an election rally on Thursday.
<p>This week the US State Department complimented India on going ahead
with
<br>polls in Kashmir under such trying circumstances,
<br>and rejected comparisons with East Timor.
<p>That prompted a bitter response from Pakistan, which pointed out that
<br>India is a party to the 1948 UN resolution which promised
<br>a plebiscite for Kashmir. "To deny the Kashmiris the same rights as
the
<br>East Timorese is a travesty of democratic rights and
<br>ideals," said the Foreign Ministry spokesman in Islamabad, Mr Tariq
<br>Altaf.
<p>Voting today takes place in Udhampur and Jammu constituencies, where
<br>more than 3,000 polling booths have been declared
<br>security risks. More than 150 people have been killed in political
<br>violence in the Jammu region in the past three months, and
<br>posters in the area warn people against voting.
<p>More than 500,000 Indian troops are deployed for internal security
<br>duties in Kashmir, but the elaborate security arrangements can
<br>work both ways. Last week, people in the Kashmir Valley complained
of
<br>being forced to vote by gun-toting Indian troops.
<p>In an election which has generally evoked little enthusiasm, Kashmiris
<br>caught in the cross fire of separatist and military violence are
<br>the least enthusiastic voters of all.
