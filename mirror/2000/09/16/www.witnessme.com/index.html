<p>September 18, 1999
<br>Four Kashmiris killed in cold blood,
<br>Severe Government Coercion in Indian Election polling
<p>Today in Baramulla, the government of India made true on a threat by
<br>its puppet leader in Kashmir, Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, to "use
<br>the armed forces and drag the people out of their homes and vote at
<br>gunpoint". This threat was made since the Indian government is angry
<br>about the successful people's boycott of Indian elections held thus
far
<br>to voice their demand for independence.
<p>In all most every localities, journalists saw people being dragged from
<br>their homes and voting at gunpoint. People were seen being beaten,
and
<br>dozens were arrested and taken to detention centers. In those areas
<br>where villagers resisted voting and non-violently protested, the Indian
<br>army used lethal force firing into crowds of Kashmiri men, women, and
<br>children. In the towns of Shilvath three innocent civilians were shot
<br>in cold blood and in Haigam, a 17 year-old boy was killed when Indian
<br>forces fired into another protesting crowd.

<br>The Pioneer Delhi 19 September, 1999
<br>Eight killed in J&amp;K Security men "force" people to caste vote
<p>PNS ADDS FROM SRINAGAR: At least eight persons including two ITBP men
<br>were killed and scores injured in the incidents of firing and explosions
<br>that marred the polling for Baramulla parliamentary constituency in
<br>Kashmir.
<p>Three persons were killed in Shilwat village in Sumbal Assembly segment
<br>when security forces allegedly opened fire on the residents following
<br>their refusal to cast their votes. The residents alleged that columns
of
<br>Rashtriya Rifles swooped on the village and ordered the local people
to
<br>come out of their houses to cast their votes. The residents opposed
them
<br>and raisd slogans, which enraged the forces. They opened fire and eight
<br>persons were allegedly hit by bullets, of whom three got killed.
<br>However, an Army spokesman said that securitymen opened fire in
<br>self-defence when some people attemted to snach their weapons.
<p>A 17-year-old boy was killed under similar conditions at Hiagam village
<br>in Sangrama Assembly segment. He was identified as Altaf Hussain. The
<br>residents alleged that security forces herded out all the villagers,
<br>including small boys and girls from their houses and asked them to
vote.
<br>When people resented, they were allegedly fired upon, resulting in
the
<br>death of one boy. The residents took out a massive protest march and
<br>staged dharna on Srinagar Baramullah highway. They kept the body of
the
<br>boy on the highway for more than an hour.
<p>Two person were injured in another incident of coercion of voters at
<br>Tarzoo near sopore. Reports of use of force by securitymen
<br>came from almost everywhere in the constituency. People in Langate,
<br>Kalamabad, Kulangam, Chogal, Sopore, Seelu, Pattan,
<br>Bandipora, Uri and several others places alleged that they
<br>were dragged out by security forces to vote. A team of
<br>mediapersons including this corespondent saw a BSF party led by DIG
DS
<br>Tiwana herding out people to polling booths at Palpora Qaziabad in
<br>Langate. At Kulangam, the scene was same, as jawans of Rashtriya Rifles
<br>were engaged in forcing people to vote.
<p>In village Zungam in Pattan Assembly segment, Army personnel were seen
<br>making the rounds and knocking at the doors of local residents and
<br>asking them to come out and vote. When mediapersons wanted to know
from
<br>one of the officers as to why they were coercing people out of their
<br>houses, he retorted, "Yeh Ghar main baithne Ka Time Nahi Hai" (This
is
<br>not the time to sit inside the house). A woman alleged that she was
<br>beaten up when she refused to vote.
<p>NC leader and party polling agent Ghulam Hassan Shikari was shot dead
on
<br>Saturday afternoon by militants at village Keegam in Kupwara district,
<br>police said. In a major strike to enforce poll boycott, militants
<br>attacked Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel posted at a polling
<br>station at Ajas, 40 km from here, killing two of its jawans and wounding
<br>three others, the sources said.

<p>The Asian Age Delhi 19 September, 1999
<br>Shadow of fear, spark of anger in Kashmir Valley
<p>By Yusuf Jameel
<br>Baramulla: Never before has this ancient town in the narrow Jhelum
<br>valley seen as much tension as it did on Saturday. Hundreds of
<br>gun-wielding securitymen swarmed the otherwise deserted streets -some
<br>manning drop-gates and checkpoints laid at short distances. Others
stood
<br>guard behind sandbagged bunkers. Very few of the 50,000 voters here
<br>ventured out to vote.
<p>At Khanpora, only 151 out of 2,347 registered voters
<br>had cast their vote in the first three hours of polling. The enthusiasm
<br>among the voters witnessed during the last election was missing.
<br>However, most of the voters said they had come to vote to support their
<br>neighbour, Khan-pora is the birthplace of Prof. Saifuddin Soz who is
<br>seeking re-election from Baramulla. Some, however, alleged that they
<br>were coerced to vote. "Last evening and also this morning soldiers
<br>threatened from the mosque loudspeakers that people without indelible
<br>ink mark on their fingers would be seen as a terrorist and treated
as
<br>such," said Sheikh Abdul Qayyum as he emerged out of a booth behind
the
<br>tomb of sufi saint Syed Mohammad Rufayee Qadiri or
<br>Janbaz Wali. Chaos persisted at the polling booths.
<br>Some of the voters were complaining that their names were missing from
<br>the electoral list. An ailing woman was escorted and brought in by
two
<br>other elderly women. A young man, apparently aware of their political
<br>affiliation, guided them how to cast their vote and pointed out a
<br>particular election symbol. Neither the polling officers nor the people
<br>objected to this. The shabby building of government boys middle school
<br>at Bangla Bagh had seven polling booths with 5,067 voters. Only 13
votes
<br>had been polled till 10.30 am. There were at least six checkpoints
and
<br>drop-gates along the road to neighbouring Sopore, with tight security
<br>checks.
<p>The killing of two local traders by CRPF men at Sopore in reprisal to
a
<br>militant attack which had left 26 policemen injured earlier this week,
<br>has driven up the tension rate in this apple-rich town. Not a single
<br>vote had been cast by midday, nor were any election agents present.
On
<br>the way to Srinagar, about 1,500 men and women were squatting on the
<br>highway, at Haigam, wailing "Ya Hussain, Ya Hussain." In the middle
of
<br>the crowd was the body of a 17-year-old boy - Altaf Hussain Mir - whose
<br>parents and neighbours alleged that he was shot dead by troops who
<br>descended on this predominantly Shia village on Saturday morning to
<br>coerce them to vote.
<p>"They came and began herding us out to the polling station but we
<br>resisted and they began to fire volleys in the air," said an elderly
<br>protestor. Mir had told the soldiers that he wasn't a voter. One of
them
<br>started hitting him, another shot him in the abdomen, the witnesses
<br>said. When the villagers protested, an officer told them that his
<br>juniors had been fired upon from the rear and in the melee one of them
<br>triggered off his gun.
<p>However, at the Pattan township, a large number of voters had turned
up
<br>at two main polling booths and none of them had a complaint. At one
of
<br>these, activists of National Conference were ensuring that their
<br>candidate Abdur Rashid Shaheen gets all the votes. Their counterparts
<br>from other parties looked helpless. Pattan is Mr Shaheen's hometown.
<br>Up in Tangmarg, several voters said they were using their democratic
<br>right out of their free will.
