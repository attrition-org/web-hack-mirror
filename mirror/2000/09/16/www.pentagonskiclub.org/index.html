"the youth these days" Are here because of the things the adults did, they feed our mind with their perverted shit to make a buck and say it's our fault. It's all our fault. We thought it up ourselves to beat people, or whatever. Whatever, much complained about by adults and youth alike, but if they had had brains in the first place we wouldn't be so clueless.<br>
        At least we have "rage", we rebel, against a decent life? Hell no, every day the world squirms to work they don't care about like work ants. Everyday, they are, the adults are, stress filled, hyperactive, pill taking, mindless drones
        meant to consume.<br>
        Now most of the "adults" will say: stupid rant caused by teenage angst.<br>
        Yes, because I see things I don't like, I complain. Complaining causes change, and that's what must happen.
        There shouldn't be another generation like this one. If we do it right,
        maybe there won't be a next generation saying: &quot;Our parents brought us here, not just into this world, but also this position. "the youth these days" Are here because of the things the adults did, they feed our mind with their perverted shit&quot;...</font>
