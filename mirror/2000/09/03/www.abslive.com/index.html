Please note that this defacement lists several hundred domains, claiming
them as being defaced -- more than we have listed here.  Attrition staff
noticed a discrepancy and went through to verify each page, through the
first hundred pages listed.  Of those hundred claimed sites, only these
twenty-eight were actually defaced; the others were either not defaced or
not reachable by Attrition staff.  We did not, therefore, list all the sites
the defacer claimed; rather, we listed only those we were able to verify
ourselves.
