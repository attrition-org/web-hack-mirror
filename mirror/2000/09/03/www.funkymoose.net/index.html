well. another
      site owned by the infamous leader of hackweiser, kermit the
frog. kermit
      came back to inform you that global domination is still going on, so
      attempt to secure your boxes as we blaze through boxen worldwide
      !@#$%^&amp;* h4r h4r h4r.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">another update from
the frog
      himself: bl4f (owned) - stop talking shit before kermit lays the
fucking
      smack down, he's very angry and miss piggy is rather upset
herself. you
      want to fucking step up? say it you elite front page media
wh0res.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">also, we'd like to
nicely
      ask that neon lenz stop ./rds'ing sites. we're sick of him trying to
be
      cool, plz stop before you make yourself look ridiculous (too
late).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">also, we're going to
be
      around for a long time. so don't expect our world domination scheme
      (cleverly hatched by kermit the frog) to end anytime soon. we're
coming
      for you next!</font></p>
