carnivore is fucking bullshit. it is not right, in a way it is invading our privacy rights.  this shit needs to be stopped before it starts monitoring every email network on the internet.
<br>
<br>
something i wrote with information about carnivore:
<br>
<p>The FBI has created an email sniffing system called carnivore. 
Carnivore permits access to the e-mail of every customer of an 
ISP and the e-mail of every person who communicates with them, 
this includes web based e-mail systems also, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc. 
They have gone too far with technological invasions of 
communications systems. This is a plain case of Internet spying. 
The FBI insisted that the Carnivore system is an important weapon 
in the war against Internet and other forms of crime but members 
of Congress expressed fears that it could be used to invade the 
privacy of innocent Internet users. That's right, those e-mails 
to grandma can be monitored. Were losing our privacy more and 
more, we must take a stand before we loose all of our privacy. 
Constitutional rights don't end where cyberspace begins. We need 
preserve our Fourth Amendment rights. We're basically left with 
the FBI attaching a listening advice to an Internet Service 
Provider, and simply having their assurances that they'll look at 
only those things that a court tells them they can look at. They 
are able to look at everything that's going through that Internet 
Service Provider, and we don't know what they're looking at, and 
what they're not, we have no way of monitoring it.</p>
