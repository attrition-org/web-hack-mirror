<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="3">This page has been 0wn3d.. why?
Well, because I can!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00" size="3">I thought I would take a moment
to talk about driving in America.. yes, driving.. I try not to drive more then I
have to, probably because 98.7% of everyone else on the road is a <b><i>TOTAL
FUCKING MORON </i></b>who has no business using a can opener, let alone
operating an automobile.. I swear, if murder was legal I would just be killing
people right and left..&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00" size="3">Anyway, I was watching the
Olympics and MY GOD, what had become of these games? <i><b>EVERYTHING </b></i>is
a fucking Olympic sport! &quot;Women's Air Rifle&quot; - wait a sec, that's
nothing more then chicks with BB guns.. I think I will stop watching the
Olympics until they integrate lumber jack games or or maybe Magic (the card
game)..</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00" size="3">Enough with my ranting.. it's
time I give a little back to the world.. Ladies, I am <i>single</i>! Yes, that's
right - I am available for your pleasure.. I am looking for someone between the
ages of 17 and 23, who is a total hard body, can fuck like a whore, is as pure
as snow, and has a full grasp of *nix operating systems.. financial stability it
a plus, and our dates will be a little easier if you have transportation.. I
currently live with my parents, but I can always card a hotel room.. so what do
I have to offer?</font></p>

<p align="left">The biggest hello goes out to our trainer Jim - d00d, j00 r0ck
the training class and make the job fun! Since I know you're not feeling the
love through said companies financial compensation (aka &quot;paycheck&quot;),
just forward this URL to yer boss, and I'm sure that when they&nbsp; see you
inspired one of your students to actually break into someone's server, and
deface their web page.. well, you&nbsp; should at least get some pencils with
your name on them or maybe some custom post-it notes.. if they don't.. well,
&quot;... that's nice&quot; btw, is Kelly single? Chicks dig hax0rs! </p>
<p align="left">Everyone else:</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00" size="3">All of #rsh, #bluelight, pimpshiz,
Stormii Star (you're a bad ass chick, I really like you), Moira, Ashke (you're very cool and you're
writing ROCKS!), DiscoStu, KEK (you're a very close friend), applesbliss, Hackweiser, fux0r
(you guys are funny as hell!), attrition.org, everyone from room #470 at DC8, everyone
else in our training class, that cute TL with the brown hair, and .. um.. I
think that's enough.. sorry to all those I missed!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Admin: Nothing has been harmed, I re-named
index.html (index.0wn).. I patched the vulnerability that allowed me to
compromise your system, so consider us even - I fixed <i>your </i>box in
exchange for a little web-hosting time.. if you wish to know <i>how </i>I broke
in, you can find a description of the exploit (along with my e-mail address) in
the file 0wn3d.txt (it's in your root directory).. thank you, that is all..</font></p>
