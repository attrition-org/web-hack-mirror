<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">there have been a few misconceptions about
GForce Pakistan , we'd like to clear them out in this and in a few more
of our future defaces.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">1) we don't hack for fame.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">2) we don't use canned stuff.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">3) we are not racists.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">4) we don't hate india and indians , we
just hate what they are doing in kashmir.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">5)&nbsp; we don't hate UN &amp; America
, we just hate their cold shoulder towards this major problem.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">6) we don't hack for fun.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">7) we hack for a cause (cause is to create
more global awareness on kashmir issue)</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">8) we do not really harm the computers
we break in, we leave old.html and no trojans behind us.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">9) our mission is to deliver , to convey
the message of kashmiri muslim brothers to the whole world.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">10) last but not least , we have only
6 members, their handles are given at the end and who ever except for these
members claims to be a part of GForce Pakistan is nothing but a wannabe.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Question : what is it all about kashmir
?</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Answer : In a nutshell this question can
be answered that in 1947 when british left this sub-continent they divided
it into two nations , one Pakistan and the other one is India , and at
that time indivisual rulers of different states were given a choice to
either become a part of india or of Pakistan.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At that time the ruler of Kashmir state
gave his vote for india and decided to become a part of india (which at
that time and still is a hindu state not a secular state at all) , but
the majority in kashmir was of muslims and they din't wanted to become
a part of a hindu state at all.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you think that legally it is quite suitable
for kashmir to be a part of india then the same situation arised in state
of junagarh aswell where the ruler voted for his state to be a part of
Pakistan but since majority in that state was of hindus , india took over
the place and nobody reacted to their move because the majority was of
indians.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That's what kashmir is all about --</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">why dont they do the same thing with kashmir
? why dont they again do what majority wants and not the typical ruler?</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Besides hell with the kashmir becoming
a part of Pakistan , just free them , let them go , you cannot hold on
to anything for longer , Russia was super power when it tried to take over
afghanistan but the rebels got russia crushed and burned and everyone know
what russia is today.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">kashmir kashmir kashmir it's getting on
everyone's nerves , its creating problems , several ppl are murdered over
there , several women are executed over there , some blame it on indians
some blame it on rebels , some blame it on Pakistan , why dont you just
leave them alone and free them for a change ? huh ?</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It's era of economic strength and technology
, ppl get media attention easily these days so nobody can hold anyone back
for longer period ..what we think that india should talk this matter out
peacefully and leave kashmir on their own just like bangladesh .. let them
choose what they want ..thats what this is all about. and in that way both
countries india and PAKISTAN can spend their money more on the ppl and
not more for defence and military machinery. And both nations can show
the power and talent of this sub-continent to the whole world.&nbsp;</font>
