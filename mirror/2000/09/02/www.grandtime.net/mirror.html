<!-   (biosdisk) hell i would shit in a pool if i could get away with it 

Hi kids. Despite what some people think, DHC has not quit defacing. With
over 300 defacements under our belt it would be silly to stop now. So what
have we been doing lately? Many DHC members are active programmers and have 
been doing more code-wise. Hell, even our warez kid is learning ASM. Do you
fear? Nemesystm and sinfony have been doing some work in another group
(www.ro0t.nu/csl). Also, just to clear some stuff up...when DHC was
defacing and posting information on missing children, that was not a gay
attempt to get media attention. Not too long ago, a young girl that lived
close to sinfony was kidnapped and found brutally murdered. We will
continue to try to help spread the information of missing persons. If the
media finds that interesting, so be it. I know some of you may find the
defacements with the missing persons info 'boring' or 'dumb'; we don't really
give a damn. Anyways...on to something else. Where the hell is that kid
artech? Anybody know if he got raided or what? He was stupid as fuck, but I
thought he was a nice kid.
Welp, I'm out...peace. 

	(- Greets and respect go to all the groups and people constantly 
learning and doing something productive. You know who you are. Uber
super respect goes to the gforce crew for having the balls to do what
they do. Keep it up guys =] -)

ps: No members of confess.sins.labs had anything to do with this defacement.
This was pure DHC. Peace.
