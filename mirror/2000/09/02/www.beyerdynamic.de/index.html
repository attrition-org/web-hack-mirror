<h1>
<font color="#999999">THIS IS FUCKING WAR</font></h1>
<font color="#999999">We will stop at nothing to take down what we believe
is wrong and a injustice to the world.</font>
<br><font color="#999999">Companies everywhere in the world exploit people
looking to them as net margin profit or loss, and/or as a number to be
trashed whenever they deem fit.</font>
<br><font color="#999999">THIS SHIT WILL BE STOPPED.</font><font color="#999999"></font>
<p><font color="#999999">Our group is prepared for a full scaled war.</font>
<br><font color="#999999">The lines have been drawn, the sites targeted.</font><font color="#999999"></font>
<p><font color="#999999">Our list of demands? We don't have any. Wishing
for materialistic things would just be a hypocrisy on our part.</font>
<br><font color="#999999">We wish to change your way of thinking, the worlds
way of thinking.<br>
Today we live in a society that is more or less communist (that there is
anything wrong with communism heh). Everyone works for a company, and if
it takes</font>
<br><font color="#999999">personal loss to further the company, it is deemed
fine and actually welcomed.</font>
<br><br>
Once again, this shit, if continued, will either destroy us in a war that
will insue, or make us all slaves to a higher up.
<br>We, Hackweiser, will not sit by as our fellow human beings are hurt
mentally (and sometimes physically) because of a company.
<br><br>
Admins, we are coming for you.
<br>Prepare for salvation.... for the end is near.
