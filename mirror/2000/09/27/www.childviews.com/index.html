  <p><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">" Inequitable exposures of atrocity, 
    Mythological heroes fighting to the death, Potato bag children quarelling 
    in the yard, Metal toothpicks of descending size, Extending towards a blue 
    infinity; 24 layers of material in a moon suit; Old weapons on display; HazMat 
    trucks appearing daily; Green forests hiding power plants; Rectal leakage 
    in an age of mindless motion, Propelled by ever increasingly designed tasks 
    For the already high occupancy human subject. In a recent survey, 3 out of 
    4 Americans said that they don't fully trust the motives of their government. 
    Ruled by a heirarchy with limited information And distrust in its citizens, 
    We have lost our right shoulders to a high Occupancy life of no matter, JUST 
    MATERIAL ! "</font></b></p>
