<!-- 
• Try the official fux0r shot! 
requirements:
a.] Irish Creme Whiskey (none of the real cheap shit either...
b.] A lil bit of milk
c.] A Fresh Lemon
-
directions: 
1.] Mix drink 5/6 Irish Creme, 1/6 milk
2.] Find unknowing friend and make him take the shot, holding it in his mouth.
3.] With the shot waiting in the shooters mouth immediately make them bite and 
suck on a big piece of fresh lemon. and hold it for a sec..
-
synopsis: the lemon will force the creme shot to curdle in the shooters mouth, filling it with a bunch of weird goopy shit.
sometimes resulting in hilarious & instaneous volatile vomitting... hence, fux0r shot..

well hey there website veiwer person.. where you aware to the fact that
the security of the website you are new viewing was compromised because
the admin decided to be so generous as to post his vote of yay0r in your
favor... vote for what? no not some secretary boppin conglomor4t, but the
fact that you dont like their mouse-tr4p. ya see the way things are theres
too many doors left ajar. i myself like to sit and obzerve this from a far.
but it is ok, things are sure to change, maybe these sorts of things will
make something click in your brain. hmmm, ya think we should maybe consider
these things? i mean after all our website is up for <u>the world</u> to see.
oh well anyway you should keep yourself informed, education is the only
cure for the problem in the norm. oh well anyway i dont have time to get all
emotional, my shrink told me not too. but what can i say, thats the way things
are, in these days and age...

a big fux0r yew tew: i dont know what the hell got this started, but i know some of the other
grewps have found their shit being re-tagged by lil scavenger pricks, some even going to the
extent of re-using the html and stuff from the original tag an merely changing text, i knew 
lameness could usually over-run simple logic but damn whats next? i hope you lil bastards 
accidentally slap the tip of your dick on the toilet lip at an international airport
and get a nice good case of the vietnamese dick slug and your testicles shrivel up into your
body...

admin: nothing harmed in anyway, just bringing your attention to a flaw which
allowed me to deface your website, might as well have been me, because i dont
hurt anything. no grudges held, don't lose your buzz, all is well. if ya think
about it i'm sure you'll see this probably could have been prevented, but who 
knows...
anyway have a nice day, and remember fux0r luvs yew...
