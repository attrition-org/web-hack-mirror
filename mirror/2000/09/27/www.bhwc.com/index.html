<!-- 
• Try the official fux0r shot! 
requirements:
a.] Irish Creme Whiskey (none of the real cheap shit either...
b.] A lil bit of milk
c.] A Fresh Lemon
-
directions: 
1.] Mix drink 5/6 Irish Creme, 1/6 milk
2.] Find unknowing friend and make him take the shot, holding it in his mouth.
3.] With the shot waiting in the shooters mouth immediately make them bite and 
suck on a big piece of fresh lemon. and hold it for a sec..
-
synopsis: the lemon will force the creme shot to curdle in the shooters mouth, filling it with a bunch of weird goopy shit.
sometimes resulting in hilarious & instaneous volatile vomitting... hence, fux0r shot..

why hello there.. how are you today? did you know this website's been
defaced by a fux0r that just wanted to say, hey... anyway its nothing
personal, but you'll prolly thank me later, for bringing your attention
to a flaw that was waiting anyway, not that i'm a hater. anyway hopefully
you see, the indescrepencies in information security, and realise it's
not necessarily your fault, but the conglomor4ts that fed you the shit
that allowed this to happen. anyway educate yourself and you just might
see, how this information security thing will bite you in the ass, unless
standards are made by means of rfc. anyway i'm getting kind of tired and
i'm needing some herbal refreshment so i'll quit with this little rant.
anyway take heed to my words, and remember your attention is required,
i know you dont want these little things being the reason your fired...

admin: nothing harmed in anyway, just bringing your attention to a flaw which
allowed me to deface your website, might as well have been me, because i dont
hurt anything. no grudges held, don't lose your buzz, all is well. if ya think
about it i'm sure you'll see this probably could have been prevented, but who 
knows...
anyway have a nice day, and remember fux0r luvs yew...
