<!-- 
• Try the official fux0r shot! 
requirements:
a.] Irish Creme Whiskey (none of the real cheap shit either...
b.] A lil bit of milk
c.] A Fresh Lemon
-
directions: 
1.] Mix drink 5/6 Irish Creme, 1/6 milk
2.] Find unknowing friend and make him take the shot, holding it in his mouth.
3.] With the shot waiting in the shooters mouth immediately make them bite and 
suck on a big piece of fresh lemon. and hold it for a sec..
-
synopsis: the lemon will force the creme shot to curdle in the shooters mouth, filling it with a bunch of weird goopy shit.
sometimes resulting in hilarious & instaneous volatile vomitting... hence, fux0r shot..

well holly gawd damn is that what i think it is? aww hell ya! its time to listen to a rant again.
anyway we want to see a lockdown on information
security. and no i'm not talking about spending tons of money, patience, & good
drinking time on hunting down someone simply because of the fact that they alerted
you to a call for attention by defacing your webpage. I mean who does this shit
really hurt? thats right, no one.. it's merely a nifty way to spread the luv.
but if you really want i guess i can try to hook you up with the full effect so
you dont feel short changed, but. OooOoOoOOoHHhH U g0ts Hax0r3d.. bahaha lets 
face it, you wanna read that crap probably about as much as i want to type it, so
fuck it... because that evil haxor crap is shiftin on meh lapadoo. what? cant feel my jive? whats wrong with you? go have a stiff drink and a lap dance too. your too
tense if your freakin about this, maybe you should reject technology all together
and go live butt asz naykeh swingin from the tree's with your ding-a-ling, or hell
i dunno, just do something. besides, i promise you, go to the links, educate your
selves. you may just thank me later for pointing the way, and trying to bring your
attention to the way things are, like the fact mr. man might just be watching you
with a supposedly 'harmless' tool so elegently named '<i>carnivore</i>'. or how about the fact that as you read this, if your on an m$ os, are more than likely transmitting data about yourself. but i dunno, maybe your right. maybe the conglomor4ts arent the ones with no sight. and maybe i'm the one you should be angry at. but hey oh well, atleast i tried. but i thought most people like to know, when they have been told a lie. but obla di obla dah, time to go play on the evil haxor see-saw.

admin: nothing harmed in anyway, just bringing your attention to a flaw which
allowed me to deface your website, might as well have been me, because i dont
hurt anything. no grudges held, don't lose your buzz, all is well. if ya think
about it i'm sure you'll see this probably could have been prevented, but who 
knows...
anyway have a nice day, and remember fux0r luvs yew...
