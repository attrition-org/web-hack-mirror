<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>SRINAGAR, Sept 12: At least four
Indian soldiers and two Kashmiri Mujahideen were killed in an intense gunbattle
inside an army camp in occupied Kashmir on Tuesday, an army spokesman said.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>However, police sources put the
death toll much higher.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>In an apparent suicide attack, Mujahideen
entered the camp of 34 Rashtriya Rifles at Beerwah town, 35 kilometres
north of Srinagar, after throwing grenades and firing on the army picket.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>The dawn attack by the Mujahideen
lasted several hours. Indian troops cordoned off the area and drew the
Mujahideen into an intense gunbattle.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>"Two militants were killed when
they tried to sneak into our security force camp at Beerwah. Four soldiers,
including an officer were killed, while five others have been injured,"
said army spokesman Major Bharat Shane.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>"We recovered hand grenades and
ammunition from the militants," Shane added.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>Indian army helicopters ferried
the injured from the base camp in Beerwah to a hospital in Srinagar.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>A top police official said the number
of Indian soldiers killed in the suicidal attack was higher than the army
was admitting.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>"Eleven Indian soldiers, including
an officer were killed in the firefight. There were at least six to eight
sorties run by army helicopters given the task of shifting the dead and
injured to Kashmir's main army hospital in Srinagar," he said.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>An emergency meeting was called
by army headquarters in Srinagar to discuss the attack, and matters such
as bolstering the spirit of the soldiers in occupied Kashmir amid growing
attacks by the Mujahideen.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>Lashkar-i-Tayyaba claimed responsibility
for the operation, saying that only two fedayeen (fighters) had died.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>Locals near the trouble spot fled
their homes and have not been allowed to return by the security forces.-AFP</font></font>
