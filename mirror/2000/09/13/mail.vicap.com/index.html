<br>Thats right admin, I got your system.

<p>Now go tell your admin buddies, that we are coming for their
coporations.

<p>I would suggest not hiring a security consultant, since they usually

cost alot more money then they are worth (heh)

<p>What will you tell them?

<p>Tell them.. b33rcan owns you, and lubs them, and lubs their system and

lubs domination

<p>hackweiser > corporations

<p>And it might seem like hackweiser likes to bite gH, but umm.. we don't.

There are/were other groups that sport such things as global domination,

so don't

<br>even say that =)

<p>And one more thing..

<p><u>This week is nation lubbage week!</u>

<br>so next time you see a hax0r, give him a hug =)<br>

<BR>

<br>werd to:

<br>#blacksun, seksi, tnc, herbless, mosthated and gH, all my boys in
hackweiser!#*&amp;@#

and of course, my love of my life, ivana =)</center>
