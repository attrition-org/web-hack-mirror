<b><font size=+3>Hacked
By Neon-Lenz</font></b>
<br><b><i><font size=-1>&nbsp;Guess who is in your MicroSnot Eye Eye Ass
Server ? :)</font></i></b><font size=-1></font>
<p>Another few <b>.it</b> webservers hacked by me, no fancy gfx this time.
Just plain <b>HTML</b>. Admin, nothing was damaged, i've only added this
.html, yours is backed up as .bak. For information about the vulnerability
and the fix = <a href="mailto:neonlenz@hushmail.com">neonlenz@hushmail.com</a>
<p>This is not good..., <b>TEST Group </b>one of the biggest companies,
spreaded all over Italy. But guess what admin ? Stupid move of you to host
them all on one server. And so poorly secured.., it kind of makes me feel
like stealing candy from a <a href="http://www.disney.com">2 year old</a>.
<p><b>Some hints for you, admin:</b>
<br>First of all, secure your SQL, close NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP, COMMON
error) and remove all the samples from your public directory. It is always
the lazyiness of the admin, of just deleting few unneeded samples, ticking
off few network configurations, IS that so difficult (you're getting paid!!)
? Anyway, i hope you'll understand that now, take security <b><u>seriously</u></b>.
<p><b>Hack-Courses ?</b>
<br>I've read about Ernst &amp; Young offering those hack-courses in South
Africa on Packetstorm. Pretty neat, i think that is the best way to train
people how to secure their servers, good thing! More countries should do
that ! *do you feel the hint, Admin?* ;p
<p><b>Tom Green...</b>
<br>Umm Brainstorm (ElectronicStorms) ? I saw your defacement about Tom
Green and Cancer, are you sure that he has cancer ? I saw the stuff about
the fund and stuff, it looked pretty serious. But you know Tom.., are you
sure it's not a prank ? Feedback would be appreciated bud. You might think
i'm stupid, but you know i do NOT live in The States. That's the main reason.
<p>Ok now..the old thing coming up again, <u>greets to</u> :)
<p><b>Greets to:</b>
<br>Acid Blades, Trib(unal), Herbless, Fux0r, Social Outcast (i apologize
about the NBT incident ;) ), ScorpionKTX, u4ia, Alldas, Attrition (They
are in NO way responsible for this, i just felt like adding them here,
because of their mirroring service) and other neat ppl like the Dutch Hackers
i know. The slashdot.org hack was neato, hey <b>{}</b> you r00l ;)
<p>Well i guess i've talked too much this time 8), time for me to shut
up.. signing off...
<p>-<b>Neon.</b>
<p>P.S. : m0r0n and nightman.. you guys like re-defacing right ? Well i
don't mind, keep doing it. That'll show how lame you guys really are :)
, i hope you guys are in no way affiliated with G-FORCE, because they're
l33t.
