<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To Admin:</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Nothing was damaged admin.
I've backed up your .asp to .hak. For more information on the vulnerability
and the fix, e-mail me at <a href="mailto:neonlenz@hushmail.com">neonlenz@hushmail.com</a>
- Only e-mails from the admin/webmaster will be accepted (preferrable <b>@g-group.bg</b>).
E-mails like "teach me how to deface and what is the vulnerability so that
i can re-deface it" will be deleted without a reply.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>About the Free "Hacker"
subject:</font></font></b><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I wrote this not meaning
to be offensive, it's just my personal opinion on this...</font></font></i></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>
:</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I think the "Free Kevin Mitnick,
Comrade, Shadow Knight, Dark Lord, MafiaBoy or whoever" is just a bunch
of bullshit. Anyone who considers himself a cracker/hacker/defacer should
be prepared for this. Ok it's true that .gov-guys shouldn't frame innocent
hackers (who have maybe hacked other sites/servers but not theirs). But
it doesn't mean that the so-called "innocent hackers" haven't commited
any <b>other</b> crime. Every hacker who made the first step "hacking"
should be prepared for this, there is no one to blame than him or herself.
You should be responsible for your own deeds. So if you get caught, don't
act stupid. You know what you've done, and you didn't cover up your tracks
too well. So my opinion is <b><i>"Free Nobody and Take The Responsibility"</i></b>.
Including myself, i am already prepared.....</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Let's face it, FBI won't
be tracking your ass down if you haven't commited any computer-crime before...
even if they have tracked down the wrong one. They still have caught a
"computer-criminal".....</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
