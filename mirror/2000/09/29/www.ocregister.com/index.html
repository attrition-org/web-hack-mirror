Attrition believes this is one of the first known defacements of a news site
where the defacers somewhat subtly modified articles to include information
such as the name of an alleged "informant."

While this defacement was not as seamless as it could have been, this is
the first step towards the modification of news sites in an attempt to
distort public perception of events.  Had the changed and added text in
the below articles not been so obvious, how would that effect the public
perception of the issue? 

This is one of the first known Subversion of Information (SoI) attacks 
we've seen and we hope this will be an example of how important the 
security of news sites are.

The main page of this defacement was modified as were 3 articles:

<ul>
<li> <a href="community/crimecourts/hack0s0922cci3.html">Break-in called no brilliant feat</a>
<li> <a href="community/crimecourts/hack00922cci.html">O.C. man charged in NASA hacking</a>
<li> <a href="community/crimecourts/hack0b0922cci2.html">Hacking suspect known as a 'nice kid'</a>
</ul>

NOTE: Because of the way we take our mirrors, many of the links
on these pages appear to originate via Attrition. This simply is 
the result of the OC Register using local paths to files.
