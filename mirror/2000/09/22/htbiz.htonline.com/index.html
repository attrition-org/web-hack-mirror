<p>Pretty unbelievable, this website is owned by a guy who specifically
focuses on Computer-Security and Network Intrusion.
<p><b><font size=+1>Where is this world going to ?</font></b>
<p>But anyway Admin, no damage was done to your website. I've only added
this .asp, i saw that you have back-ups in your dir. So there was no need
for me to back it up for you. Send me an e-mail <a href="mailto:neonlenz@hushmail.com">(neonlenz@hushmail.com)</a>
if you wanna know more about the vulnerability, and on how to fix it. (the
admin/webmaster only, so other guys who are reading this don't bother to
send me e-mails on the vulnerability or on how to hack it, i am only accepting
e-mails from @htonline.com or at least some proof that it his/her website).
<p>Btw Re-Defacers, don't be so lame, it's not really difficult by visiting
Alldas viewing them and re-defacing it and sending them to Attrition (just
because of Attrition is a little bit slower than Alldas archiving them).
If this happens again, i will have to patch the vulnerability myself. Which
is a shame, the admin learns more about the security of his/her own website,
by teaching them how to patch it themselves (and hey they might like it
too!).
<p>Ok finally, enough BS. Here are some greets to some cool buds of mine:
Acid Blades, Trib, D-Force and Herbless (lekker roken) ;-)
<p>Signing Off....
