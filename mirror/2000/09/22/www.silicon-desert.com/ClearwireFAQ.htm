      <ul>
        <font face="Arial"><b> </b></font> 
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">What is Silicon Desert Wireless and what 
          are they offering in the Albuquerque metropolitan area?</font></li>
      </ul>
      <dir> 
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Silicon Desert Wireless is a fixed wireless 
          (not mobile) high-speed Internet access service that is based on technology 
          and services provided by Clearwire Technologies, Inc. The product uses 
          spread spectrum and point-to-multipoint communications technologies, 
          developed by Clearwire, in place of the wires or fiber used to deliver 
          conventional wired communications services. Silicon Desert Wireless 
          is offering this service to teleworkers, small office/home office, and 
          small to medium-sized businesses in the Albuquerque metropolitan area.</font></p>
      </dir>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">How does Silicon Desert Wireless compare 
          with ISDN, DSL and T1 connections?</font></li>
      </ul>
      <dir> 
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Like our dedicated ISDN connections, Silicon 
          Desert Wireless service is always on; there&#146;s never a busy signal. 
          Unlike DSL, the service speed does not diminish with distance from the 
          network (in this case, not the central office, but the base station). 
          Unlike IDSN and T1 connections, which may be connected to the Public 
          Service Telephone Network (PSTN), Silicon Desert Wireless service, functions 
          like a private network IP connection between you the end-user and Silicon 
          Desert.</font></p>
      </dir>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">How quickly can you get me connected?</font></li>
      </ul>
      <dir> 
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">An Silicon Desert Wireless connection can 
          typically be established within 3-5 business days after order. The single 
          greatest reason an installation may take longer is if gaining permission 
          to, and installing the antenna on the roof of the property are required 
          (expected in less than 30% of installations).</font></p>
      </dir>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Is the service secure?</font></li>
      </ul>
      <dir> 
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes, very secure. Underlying the Silicon 
          Desert Wireless connection is military-grade communication technology. 
          Additionally, the service is protected by authentication, proprietary 
          signal processing techniques, and directional antennas which it make 
          both very difficult to detect the radio frequency transmissions, and 
          <u>very</u> difficult to exploit. While no communications network is 
          absolutely secure, the &#145;work-factor&#146; required to exploit data 
          sent over the Clearwire network is at least as high as that for wired 
          and satellite telecommunications networks. If desired, the end-user 
          can achieve an even levels of security by introducing encryption at 
          the application layer.</font></p>
      </dir>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Is it safe?</font></li>
      </ul>
      <dir> 
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Absolutely. The Clearwire transceiver actually 
          emits less power than a cellular telephone (sub 1 watt), and the antenna 
          will be installed at least 12 feet above ground level.</font></p>
      </dir>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">What do I need to get service?</font></li>
      </ul>
      <dir> 
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The professional installer of your Silicon 
          Desert Wireless connection will provide everything you need. The Indoor 
          Unit or access server will be connected to your router, hub or PC equipped 
          with an RJ-45 10Base-T Ethernet interface (cables are included). The 
          Outdoor Unit, an antenna and small electronic box about the size of 
          a Palm Pilot<sup>TM</sup>, is installed in the window, side or roof 
          of your building, and connected to the Indoor Unit by coaxial cable. 
          The installer will configure the equipment with the necessary IP address(es).</font></p>
      </dir>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Is the service affected by weather conditions?</font></li>
      </ul>
      <dir> 
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">No. Unlike some other wireless products 
          that operate in bands that ARE affected by weather, the Silicon Desert 
          Wireless service is unaffected by rain, snow, sleet, hail, fog or atmospheric 
          conditions of any kind, and all of the antenna options are rated for 
          wind loads in excess of 100 mph.</font></p>
      </dir>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Do you need access to the roof of my building 
          to get me connected?</font></li>
      </ul>
      <dir> 
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Probably not. In most cases, due to the 
          unique attributes of Clearwire&#146;s product, access can be achieved 
          through a side of building or window mounted antenna, helping to achieve 
          the goal of service provisioning in ones of days after receipt of order.</font></p>
      </dir>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Are you going to put an ugly antenna on 
          my building?</font></li>
      </ul>
      <dir> 
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Probably not. Clearwire has married its 
          customer premise equipment (CPE) with a family of aesthetically neutral 
          antennas that will not detract from your building&#146;s architecture 
          or appearance. We will only install an aesthetically challenged antenna 
          if you say it&#146;s okay, and then, only if necessary.</font></p>
      </dir>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Do I need any special network equipment, 
          like a router?</font></li>
      </ul>
      <dir> 
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">No. Clearwire's customer premise equipment 
          is equipped with a 10 Base-T Ethernet interface and performs the TCP/IP 
          routing functions inside; no router is required.</font></p>
      </dir>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Can I get this service outside the Albuquerque 
          metropolitan area?</font></li>
      </ul>
      <dir> 
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Presently it is available only in Dallas 
          &#150; Ft. Worth, Texas and Buffalo, New York, Albuquerque, New York 
          but Clearwire is in the process of a nationwide deployment. Check Clearwire&#146;s 
          website (<a href="http://www.clearwire.com/">www.clearwire.com</a>) 
          for up to date information on their deployment plans</font></p>
