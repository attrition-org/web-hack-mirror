        Internet through the wonders of fixed wireless technology.&nbsp; Silicon 
        Desert has partnered with Clearwire Technologies to provide IP connectivity 
        throughout the Albuquerque metropolitan area.</font> 
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Wireless Internet Access</font></b> 
      <p> <font face="Arial" size="2">Silicon Desert has partnered with Clearwire 
        Technologies, the developer of a new fixed wireless local access product 
        and service deployed in Albuquerque, to deliver quickly provisioned, fractional 
        T1 speed IP connectivity throughout the metropolitan area. Silicon Desert, 
        an authorized Clearwire reseller, bundles Clearwire's wireless local access 
        services with their secure Internet access and other value added services 
        to provide one stop shop solutions to your IP communications needs. Through 
        this partnership, Silicon Desert further demonstrates its commitment to 
        delivering high quality services at affordable prices to the business 
        end-user.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2"> 
      <p><font face="Arial">The Clearwire solution is a fixed wireless IP network 
        that operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and delivers local loop connectivity 
        to Silicon Desert&#146;s network at speeds of up to 640 Kbps. The Clearwire 
        product and service are not affected by weather and are highly secure, 
        drawing from the technology&#146;s origins in the military.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Clearwire&#146;s network consists of base station 
        infrastructure equipment and customer premise equipment or CPE. The base 
        station infrastructure equipment, owned and operated by Clearwire, is 
        positioned at existing tower or rooftop sites that afford effective line 
        of sight to the desired area of coverage. The CPE, which functions as 
        an access server, is connected to an end-user's LAN, hub, or PC via a 
        10 Base-T Ethernet interface; no router is required. Both base station 
        equipment and CPE employ Clearwire's unique T/R Module technology that 
        allows the antenna and indoor unit to be installed up to 250' apart, without 
        degraded performance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Silicon Desert and Clearwire back the service with 
        a 30-day money back guarantee, and better yet, there is no equipment to 
        buy. Call Silicon Desert&#146;s sales team at 505-275-4991 for pricing 
        information on service classes available, and to get pre-qualified on 
        the spot. If you are located within the footprint of Clearwire&#146;s 
        network (and you probably are), service, which is available in speeds 
        ranging from 128 to 640 Kbps, can usually be provisioned within 3-5 days 
        of order. And to learn more about Clearwire, the Clear Choice for Wireless
