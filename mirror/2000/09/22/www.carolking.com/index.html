   > 1) take appropriate steps to cause immediate removal of DeCSS from the

   > or appropriate to suspend this illegal activity;
   
   We do appreciate your concern regarding the DeCSS software and
   the fact that it may be used for illicit purposes.
   
   However, to the best of our knowledge, the injunction granted in
   the U.S. does not cover the distribution of the software from a
   Danish server.
   
   If you believe that the injunction does cover Denmark as well,
   please let us know, and we will remove the contents of the site
   as soon as possible.
   
   If you believe that the distribution is against Danish criminal
   law, please file a complaint with the local police department.
   They will hand over the case to the Danish National Investigation
   Center (NEC) through Interpol.
</pre>
but anyways... would you like your very own copy of DeCSS? Well, here it is!
<BR><A 
href="decss.zip">DeCSS Software!</A> <br>
And we have to make sure your ready to use it, with good old winzip + crack!
<BR><A
href="winzip80.exe">The one and only dead sexy WinZip Software</A> 
<BR><A 
href="winzip8crack.zip">The damn sexy winzip8 crack! Don't leave home without it...</A> <br>
Also if you want to register a copy but not have to download the crack just use...<br>
Name: " Fuck The Damn MPA, because DeCSS > MPA "<br>
