<P>Zee News, Propaganada against Pakistan? WIll this take us anywhere?</P>
<P>Indians, I`m sorry but you cannot change, A week back zeenews presented a program 
  on television called &quot;the Inside Story&quot;<br>
  They showed 2 guys in Kargil scence and named them Major Tariq and Brig Mohammad 
  in the eposide and claimed that they were ISI, Pakistani Intelligence agents. 
  Next day it was found that The person they claimed to be major tariq was a new 
  york journalist and the other guy Brig Mohammad was a Shereton Head waiter.</P>
<P>Now what do you think you are doing by impersonating officials, making fake 
  comments, oh lalo prad and atul baja you guys are two dumb mother fuckers, I 
  hate your fucking cocky faces, I`m fedup of the ZEE NEWS Anti Pakistn propaganda 
  and promoting hate amoung our Muslim brothers In INDIA</P>
<P>Oh and you fucking morons, mentioned that www.isical.ac.inw as hacked by Pakistani 
  ISI? You idiot's can't you read?<br>
  That page Was not hacked by Pakistani Interllegence, it was hacked by GForce 
  Pakistan, do you think our security agencies don't have anything better to do? 
  or you guys don't have eyes?</P>
