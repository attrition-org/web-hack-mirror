issue in realistic manner in UN</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>ISLAMABAD, (KLC) Sep 11, 2000:
Central leader of All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) Syed Ali Gillani
said that Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf has raised Kashmir issue
in realistic way in the United Nations. “He (Gen. Musharraf) presented
his stand vigorously and in realistic manner”, the former APHC Chairman
told Radio Tehran. Syed Gillani said, the Chief Executive apprised the
entire world community of the reality of this problem. General Musharraf
has rightly said that the people of Jammu and Kashmir continue to raise
voice for justice for the last 53 years but they are still deprived of
justice, he added. He said that it is incumbent upon the world community
to come forward and grant justice to the people of the Jammu and Kashmir.
In this way this problem has come to light to the entire world community
and now the world community is politically and morally bound to use its
influence to settling this dispute, he observed. Syed Gillani said, the
attitude of India has all along been unrealistic in connection with the
Kashmir problem. He said, Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory and
the Indian rulers had pledged to grant the right of self determination
to the people of Jammu and Kashmir. However, Indians ate their words and
that is why the people of the held State have launched freedom struggle.
The former APHC Chairman said, the people of the held Kashmir continued
to struggle for the right of their self determination since 1948. Keeping
this historic background in view, this stand of India is unrealistic that
Kashmir problem should not be taken up in the UNO. “We reject this stand
of India because it is beyond reality,” he added. To a question, Syed Gillani
further elaborated that it was India which had brought this problem to
the United Nations. “If the UN is not a forum for settling the disputes,
why then India knocked the doors of NO for its settling”, he added. He
said, this problem was thoroughly discussed in the UN and then passed a
resolution in this connection on August 13, 1948. Both India and Pakistan
accepted this resolution and the world community is witness to this resolution.
It is incumbent upon the UN to settle down disputes prevailing all over
the world. So Indian cannot ignore the responsibilities of the UN in this
regard, he concluded.</font></font>
