yupp, you were right the first time, this site has been tagged in the name of
the fux0r movement. a vote of yay0r in your favor  was made in this action which
you should be happy for as it is <b>you</b> it represents. what did you just vote
for you ask? well thats a good question, well.. the topic of today is, say it with
me now.. <i>i-n-f-o-r-m-a-t-i-o-n---s-e-c-u-r-i-t-y</i>. you see right now theres
literally virtual armies whom prey upon the <i>minor formalities</i> of such flaws
only for their own personal gain. this in part is obviously going to hurt <i>someone</i>
what with what mmmaybe senstive data that can be used to further exploit a situation
and really make the person on the recieving end get the shit end either way. such
things however could be prevented by making simple changes in the current standards.
for one, the consumer in todays market is force fed products which leave them open to
attacks of different sorts. in alot of cases said consumer <i>isn't</i> properly trained
in the area, but since they had their heads in someones ass got the responsibility anyway.
the amounts of fewls i see pumped out so hastily by community colleges and education
franchises. sure you know the one's i speak of, you see them on t.v. all the time,
promising a speedy education that will render great wealth and prosperity etc. so
what do you get? try a student body that's maybe 90% wanting to just learn whats 
necessary in order to get through and pass their tests, and then mmmmaybe the other
10% whom actually have the interest and are there for a <b>real</b> reason. the number
of people i run into with mcp's & are ignorant as hell is dumbfounding within itself.
so while they're sitting their playing quake or something the dis-attention of the
information in which they are left responsibility stay unattended and dis-attenioned.
the people whose data i'm sure dont know a damn thing about whats going on but leave their
trust in their computer guys are the ones left victim. and, are left without a voice
as they dont play part of the game and are merely the onlookers that reap the benefits.
welp, i for one don't like it, no sir i dont. so i in part take voice as the majority
and lay protest through defects. there is no one imparticular one can blame, but attention
must be brought by means deemed necessary. but though i did deface your website i am
not the one to hate, nor my kind. after all, unlike those with the genuine maliscious
intent i was kind enough to leave you such an attention getter and alert you to the situation.
i never judge, i simply obzerve...

admin: nothing harmed in anyway, just bringing your attention to a flaw which
allowed me to deface your website, might as well have been me, because i dont
hurt anything. no grudges held, don't lose your buzz, all is well. if ya think
about it i'm sure you'll see this probably could have been prevented, but who 
knows...
anyway have a nice day, and remember fux0r luvs yew...
