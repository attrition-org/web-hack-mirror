JABSource Specialty Merchandise has a catalog of over 3500 items. 
You can order any of these items on-line using a simple order form.
The order form sends an e-mail to JABSource. After one business day a confirmation
e-mail will be returned with the total including sales tax(if applicable),
shipping, and any discounts or special offers. JABSource has compiled the catalog in
three formats:<BR>
Browse the On-Line Catalog page by page <A HREF="WOPPg000.htm">with graphics</A>.
Each page averages 10 pictures (gifs) per page. If you computer and modem are of sufficient speeds
(JABSource recommends Pentium 100+ and 28.8+ modem) this is a visually splendid method of browsing.<BR>
Browse the On-Line Catalog page by page <A HREF="WOPPt000.htm">without graphics</A>. Each page includes a
link to the graphics page it you wish to see the items.  However, your browsing will be much
faster.<BR>
Or, start with a <A HREF="category.htm">Category Index</A>. View a list of different
categories of item. You only see the pages that have something you are interested in.
When you are ready to order you can click on any item number and fill out the order form.
