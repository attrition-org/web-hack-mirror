<p align="center"><small><font face="Courier New">It was never easy growing up with you, your words & actions left me confused. The way you think about things makes the mad, you tried to teach me your version of bad. I never saw the reasons for your hate, I dont think you had one any way. Now I`m older, opinionated and I`m strong, so shut your mouth and listen to this song. Your way of thinking is fucking wrong and I know I can`t change you with this song, but maybe I can make you stop to think. We`re all connected, you're just the weakest link. Conditioned to hate without a reason. (I don`t understand what you believe in) no color, no race, no religion, no creed, no reason to hate, why can't you see?
