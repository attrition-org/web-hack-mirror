guess what? this site just got tagged! yes, way!
<br>
that's right, fux0r inc. is once again serving <b>you</b> by bringing your attention to
things that are not as they seem. expanding horizons an opening eyes, but as for the admin
there is no need to cry. we dont dislike <b>you</b>, no, thats not what fux0r is, its about
disliking the conglomor4ts that force fed you the shit that made this happen... a portfolio of
protests is what is in need, showing the discrepencies in information security. a mass rfc,
that cannot be ignored. made by the valiant souls of a corp. named fux0r. we want the same as
you, to not have to worry about what is true. but in this world to much info. is exchanged, a one
cannot maintain, but as many, we feed your brain, and give you the chance to render your own index.html
once again. so do not hate us for our actions, we wish for no haste. nor pass judgment upon us when
nothing is known to begin with. we hope only for attention brought, oh and of course to find your young daughters
virgin g-spot.

fuckzyouz to:  ok some prick was trying to talk shit (until i pointed out his damn daemon acct. was still default anyways ;o) about me taggin the $doze. well i say kiss my ass, i code several lingo's on both mac&pc, can throw a server together from scrap parts, able to bust out the graphical visual flavor that make the panties moist & can verbally belittle you in a couple languages including ebonix, so i might know least a wee lil bit thingy muh stuff ya thinkerd? i know taggin a *nix box is just so k-rad and all but in most cases a nixmin dont need to be bothered by me, so i just go right along and i leave them be. if their usin, then they're atleast making an effort, which is coo by me. but this judgemental, making the grade attitude takin on by peeps in the community is annoying and a waste of my time, so don't even bother with it, i dont give a shit. this isn't for you, it's for <b><u>you</u></b> if you can dig my skizmflop?. i know many are feelin my plot, and to them right-on, but to those whom dont, then dont... oblah di, oblah dah ya know? oh, and i'm sure no one would mind seeing the little rds_toolkit in less use...

admin: nothing harmed in anyway, just bringing your attention to a flaw which
allowed me to deface your website, might as well have been me, because i dont
hurt anything. no grudges held, don't lose your buzz, all is well. 
anyway have a nice day...
