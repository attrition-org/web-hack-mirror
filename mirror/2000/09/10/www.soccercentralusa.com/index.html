  1999 Report 1 Report 2 Report 3 Report 4 Report 5 Report 6 Report 7 "We took 
  the decision yesterday. I will make you come out of your homes and vote. Don't 
  think I will let you get away this time." - Indian puppet, Farooq Abdullah. 
  They waited but no one came to vote - The Indian Express (Delhi), September 
  10, 1999. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Use the armed forces and 
  drag the people out of their homes and vote at gunpoint" - Indian pupperty Farooq 
  Abdullah. The slaughter of democracy: How the army forced people to vote in 
  Kashmir - by Chindu Sreedharan Rediff on the net. "This is not an incident that 
  I will forget in a hurry. We hear more complaints, witness more incidents. And 
  finally stumble on the mother of it all in Natnussa -- sheep being led to the 
  slaughter of democracy." "Today's poll boycott should be an eye-opener for Indian 
  rulers and they should learn a lesson from today's experience as people have 
  again reposed faith in APHC and boycotted the poll. The election drama has proved 
  a farce and government should read the writing on the wall and accept our right 
  of self determination", Hurriet chairman. -</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> "I started my journey from 
  United Nation's office at Sonawar and concluded it at the Institute of Medical 
  Sciences, Soura. All along the way, I only saw security forces, not a single 
  voter, in front of polling booths. On the way, at Madina chowk, at 8:15 a.m, 
  I observed that no voters were coming to the booth. Then, I toured Maisuma, 
  Saria Bala, Habba Kadal and Chotta Bazar areas. Only a few voters, about 20, 
  were seen around the booth at Chota Bazaar. I did not see anybody interested 
  in casting his vote in these areas." - Ram Rattan Chaterjee.</font></p>
