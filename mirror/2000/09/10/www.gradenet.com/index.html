welp, what can ya say, yer site got tagged. it was bound to happen sooner or later right?
but do not lose your buzz over it, nothing was harmed. no evil haxoring stuff or anything
so a few stiff shots, maybe a lapdance, you'll get over it i'm sure. anyway i'm going to 
take a moment to punch out a little something on a rather ignored, but important subject.
yes that's right, see today, we're going to talk about information security. to add to the
suspense of the subject, more importantly <b>your</b> information security. as you probably
know, everyday your name and the identity which you have been branded passes through many-a-machine
a day. now unbenounced to most, your information is open to people all over the world wether
you like it or not. you may read in the papers about how another local business was 'hacked'
or something of sorts and tons of data was loss due to some prick with an ego. Well take the
time to think for a moment. how many people do this sort of thing, leaving a big red flag
letting them know of their need for system attention, then try to estimate those that run
silently in the shadows. i'm speaking of the one's who <b>are</b> after sensitive data, the
one's who <b>do</b> have a genuine maliscious intent. i for one am sick of seeing the false
re-affirmation of e-standards. well the fact is, your standards, aren't exactly going to be
the same as the persons using the software. it's not always the administrators faults, yet
conglomor4ts whom know nothing of anything anyway are willing to fire whoever is easiest to
lame blame and divert the heat from themselves. as has been proved several times over, we
have alot of work to do in order to get things the way they should, and rfc should be made again,
even though i'm sure several made in the past, that better standards are in need. but in order
to get this message across, simple words will not do. so consider yourself a part of the
conglomor4t marketing control group, and you just voted a big yay0r for some consideration
in <b>you</b>. not to mention that, but you get to help spit some skizmflop with links to
<a href="http://www.williamcooper.com">www.williamcooper.com</a> & <a href="http://www.echelonwatch.org">www.echelonwatch.org</a>. anyway that about does it from me, but oh ya eh, me and broda jeoh
are throwin together a pretty humdinger of an article on some cable modem combat here before
to long so watch for it, (i would especially suggest this to cox systems people ;o) 
oh well i crave sustenance & sleep.. but in the words
of fred durst of limp bizkit, 'just think about it, you'll get it...'
