  GForce Pakistan</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Kashmiri people claim 
  that the occupation of Kashmir by India is illegal. They do not want to be part 
  of India nor do they want any Indian presence on their soil. The provisions 
  of the Instrument of Accession, if genuine, stipulated that the accession to 
  India was to be ratified by a plebiscite. Since 1947, India has occupied Kashmir 
  and has stalled, by whatever means at her disposal, the progress towards the 
  holding of a plebiscite - the original and the most universally accepted solution. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There is no doubt that 
  had a referendum had been held in Kashmir, the vast majority of Kashmiris would 
  have voted to join Pakistan. Such a a referendum, in the form of a plebiscite, 
  was promised to the people of Kashmir by the Security Council in 1948. India 
  then accepted the principle of plebiscite but has since obstructed all attempts 
  at arranging one" - Kalim Siddiqui. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1957, India further violated 
  the sovereignty of Kashmir by implementing a new State Constitution which, in 
  effect, incorporated the state into the Indian Union, in face of fierce protests 
  from the Kashmiri people, Pakistan and the UN. The new Constitution was formally 
  adopted on 26th January 1957 and it declared that "the state of Jammu and Kashmir 
  is and shall be an integral part of the Union of India". Since the adoption 
  of the Constitution, India has got itself into a state of affairs, which can 
  only be described as hypocritical and aggressive. On the one hand, India claims 
  that Kashmir is an integral part of the Indian Union. On the other hand India 
  has signed two agreements (Tashkent 1966, Shimla 1972) with Pakistan, in which 
  India agreed to resolve the Kashmiri dispute through bilateral and peaceful 
  means. Further, India is still party to numerous UN resolutions which proclaim 
  Kashmir to be a disputed territory. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is hardly an exaggeration 
  to say that the whole history of Kashmir has been of misgovernment and oppression; 
  nor was this tradition dead in this century. And the political question mark 
  still hangs over the area despite India's past political control and economic 
  effort. Leaving the legal and moral issues aside, the economic disruption caused 
  by the de facto partition along the Cease-Fire line has been deplorable" - J 
  Dupuis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> More recently, India has 
  increased her role as an oppressor in Kashmir. The deployment of 500,000 troops 
  to silence the voices of the Kashmiri people is seen as the only solution by 
  the Indian government, resulting in gross violations of human rights. These 
  crimes have been carried out as a matter of routine and some are well documented 
  by the various Human Rights agencies. </font></p>
