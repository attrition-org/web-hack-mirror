<br>
yo wassup this box was rooted and defaced by datagram.  I am now defacing
for hackweiser instead of my other group (RSH).  The reason for this
change is because the rest of the group isn't into defacing, so i don't
want to deface with that group name anymore.

<u><b>A Note About Carnivore: </u></b>The FBI has created an email
sniffing system called carnivore. Carnivore permits access to the e-mail
of every customer of an ISP and the
e-mail of every person who communicates with them, this includes web based
e-mail systems also, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc. They have gone too
far with technological invasions of communications systems. This is a
plain case of Internet spying. The FBI insisted that the Carnivore
system is an important weapon in the war against Internet and other forms
of crime but members of Congress expressed fears that it could be
used to invade the privacy of innocent Internet users. That's right, those
e-mails to grandma can be monitored. Were losing our privacy more
and more, we must take a stand before we loose all of our
privacy. Constitutional rights don't end where cyberspace begins. We need
preserve our Fourth Amendment rights. We're basically left with the FBI
attaching a listening advice to an Internet Service Provider, and
simply having their assurances that they'll look at only those things that
a court tells them they can look at. They are able to look at everything
that's going through that Internet Service Provider, and we don't know
what they're looking at, and what they're not, we have no way of
monitoring it.
