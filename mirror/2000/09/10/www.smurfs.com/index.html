<p><font color=white face="Verdana" size="2">You think your life sucks? You
think you've got it worse than the rest of the world? You think you are someone
that needs special attention and care and all that other floppy bullshit in order
to get the most out of your life? I'm sick of all these rich fucks msging me
on irc from their 900mghertz computers with dvd, 21' monitors, 0d4y software
they actually paid for, and all of these other addon necessities and whining
to me that their life is worse than everyone elses. I have friends who live
on the streets, friends who carry all there lifelong possessions in their fucking
backpack. I have friends whose parents kicked them out when they were only 11 years old.
You are trying to tell me that your life is terrible? You don't know whats terrible.
The world is all about money, commerce, and value. No one cares about anything anymore
except for some worthless piece of paper with some president's face on it. The world
is a whore. It uses all its resources in order to kill the people that started off with
nothing and die with nothing, while the people that were born into wealthiness gain
more and more greed and profit. Life is not fucking fair. Fuck the world.

The smurfs are funny little creatures. They work so hard at building a  little town
day and night and night after day that only takes some kiddie fucker one second
to ./step on it and ./kill *.* with his big toe. If the smurfs were smart they would use their
magical powers to kill that bald-headed fucknut and his cat. I mean...what kind of evil
villain has a fuckin cat as a sidekick? I mean...Inspector Faggot's arch-enemy had a cat
as a sidekick pet but at least that cat had spikes around its collar. What i would like to
see is a movie where fragglerock vs. the smurfs. That would own. This hack is dedicated
to all the fucknuts that use WinSmurf. Much klown luv...</font></p><br><Br><br>
