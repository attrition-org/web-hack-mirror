Me? I had tons of the stuff... I wonder what happened to it all? Ah well...<br><br>

Ok, today I got side-tracked. I was playing with *sprintf() formatting bugs and, well, fancied a break. Hence this page....<br><br>

So, what have I to say today? One word (or, more acurately, acronym) - MPAA. I say we replace our "democratic" leaders with the MPAA
and have done with the matter. We could save millions in court fees and get laws passed passed much faster than at present. Just think,
we could all live happily under the corporate machine, safe in the knowledge that we have no rights, purchases are merely extended leases
and free speech is in fact on loan from lawyers who now want it back. From this moment forward, you can now pay for your hard-earned 
personal memories in convenient monthly installments.<br><br>

I've copied the DeCSS source code to this server. Please download it and give it to your friends. If you deface a website, include it in
the defacement somewhere. If you email a friend, attach a copy. If you run a website, put it up for download. Lets try and avoid a situation
where mega-bucks corporations decide what we can and can't say; what we can and can't code; what we can and can't use. <br><br>

You can download <a href="decss.zip">DeCSS.ZIP</a> or <a href="decss.tar.gz">decss.tar.gz</a>. So what are you waiting for?<br><br>

Admin: Your old index has been backed up as default.old.htm - don't whinge, I've not deleted anything (apart from an old 1999 logfile
so that I could free some disk space - you had run out. Don't you pay attention to things like that?).<br><br>
I used my LinSQL code to gain access to your site. The latest version is available <a href="linsql.c" target="_top"> here </a>. 
You can read a detailed explanation of the problem and some solutions <a href="explain.txt" target="_top"> here </a>.
