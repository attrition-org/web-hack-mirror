<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="2">The Kashmir issue, the most controversial issue 
  in the history of humanity. Everyday, the Indians Slaughter countless mujahideen, 
  rape, torture and execute innocent women and children. What for? What gives 
  the bloody Indians the right to violate human rights in such a manner? The Indians 
  have violated all norms of acceptable wartime conflict and have not been reprimanded 
  for their actions. There have been repeated attempts to advocate free elections 
  to let hte people choose their destiny but the Indians have suppressed all these 
  with hostile intervention and the murder of innocent civilians. Why must we 
  bear such atrocities? All over the world, the Muslims have been targeted and 
  systematically eliminated. Kashmir, Palestine, Bosnia... what gives \anyone 
  the right to try and eradicate a people different from themselves? And what 
  has the US done to prevent this? Nothing. The US has always seen itself as the 
  moderating power of the world but it has supported Israel in its cause and has 
  remained silent on the Kashmir Issue for Too long. A Must we remind everyone 
  that almost al l the people in the world is owned by the Muslims? Is that why 
  the US kisses Saudia Arabia's ass while committing such injustices deep inside? 
  And they call Pakistan a corrupt country? Just how fucking corrupt can you get 
  when the President of hte most powerful nation in the world gets a blowjob from 
  an intern working in his office??? We have suffered throughout the ages and 
  will suffer no more. This is the era of cyberwarfare, where once again the Muslims 
  have prevailed. We will not rest till every node, every line, every bit of information 
  contained in our suppressors has not been wiped out, returning them to the dark 
  ages. Well will not tolerate anymore, and we will not fail. As I type this from 
  the confront of my home... far away in a valley the blood of innocents paints 
  the mountains red....</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF" size="2">For the vast majority of time since 
  1947, the people of the state of Jammu and Kashmir pursued non-violent methods 
  to get the referendum held. The Kashmiri people are now fighting to implement 
  what has been promised to them. They want to come out of the physiological limbo 
  of not knowing if they are Indian, Pakistani or Kashmir. They want the matter 
  sorted once and for all. </font></p>
<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="2"><u><font face="Arial">It is high time to sort 
  this issue out for the following reasons:</font></u></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF" size="2">Over 50,000 Kashmiri's have been 
  killed since 1990.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF" size="2">Over 1,000 Indian army people have 
  been killed since 1990. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF" size="2">Its time India lived up to its 
  promises. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF" size="2">The whole of South Asia is unstable 
  due to this problem, especially now that both India and Pakistan are nuclear 
  powers. Two great nations namely Pakistan and India have to spend enormous amount 
  of money on their armed forces because of this problem. When India and Pakistan 
  takes 5 steps forward the Kashmir issue takes them back 6 steps. There has never 
  been a better time to sort this problem. The cold war has ended, we are at the 
  dawn of the 21st century and the potential consequences of not sorting it out 
  are two high to contemplate. Neither Pakistan, India nor Kashmir will win in 
  the war, especially if it goes nuclear. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#00FFFF">As much as We would like 
  to talk about Pakistan's right to having Kashmir as it's province We won't. 
  We are beyond that now. We don't really care who gets Kashmir; All we want is 
  to stop the violence in Kashmir. Innocent people are killed daily by Indian 
  soldiers simply because of what these people they believe in. The Kashmir's 
  support Pakistan despite the option of independence, yet the international community 
  (as a whole) does not do&nbsp; anything about it, and pretends it's not happening. 
  (If you don't believe us, then go do a UN supervised survey, 80% of the people 
  in Kashmir will vote for Pakistan, the other 20% are Indian soldiers). Let us 
  assure you, people are dying in Kashmir as you read this. They have been dying 
  for the last 50 years and no one has done anything about it. India claims it's 
  Pakistani troops that it is so efficiently killing. oh really? That's news to 
  me. Since when did women and children and&nbsp; handicapped people join the 
  Pakistan army? Since when did the rape of innocent women and children become 
  an "effective method of stopping terrorists"?&nbsp;</font><font size="2" color="#00FFFF">We 
  are sick of this. We want the Indians to back off. I'll be damned if they do, 
  but nonetheless, we want you people to know exactly what's going on and HAS&nbsp;been 
  going on in Kashmir for the last 50 years. While you people sit in your comfortable 
  homes/offices with computer, electricity, food, water, and most important of 
  all; freedom,&nbsp; eighteen people are brutally murdered in Kashmir by Indian 
  soldiers DAILY, and that's a&nbsp;highly rough estimate as another three hundred 
  or so people go 'missing' every day. And for what? Simply because they want 
  to believe in whatever they want. They want to be able to live without fear 
  of being killed, without worrying about&nbsp;&nbsp; where to get their next 
  meal, and where to run when the Indian soldiers come.&nbsp;What are we getting 
  throgh this? Is this what 21st century is? Killing? Rape? Totutre? by those 
  Indian bastards openly? UN it's about time for them to intervence, this fight 
  has been going on for 50+ years.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FFFF">Our Demands?</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FFFF">UN work on the issue damnit!@% US try to interene in

  wanted us to post up links so that people could know more about the struggle,
