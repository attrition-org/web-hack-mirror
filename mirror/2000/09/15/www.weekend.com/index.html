- During the intervening night of 17/18th May,1990, bus #1317 carrying
27 persons holding valid permission from BSF, of a marriage party, was
stopped near Badasgam village, district Islamabad crossing about 23.30
hours by BSF patrolling party . The BSF personnel opened indiscriminate
firing upon the bus. M. Abdullah S/O Gani Malik R/O Lisser died instantaneously.
Bridegroom and eight other persons accompanying him received injuries.
Bride and her chamber-maid were gang raped by the BSF personnel . The bride
was taken away by them leaving behind chamber-maid and subsequently released
after 48 hours . The bus was removed to district Police lines; it had seventy-eight
bullet-hole marks. A case was duly registered in the concerned Police station
and an inquiry was conducted by the then DIG Kashmir and a medical report
also obtained duly proved the lady was raped. However despite the assurances
given by the Government from time to time for taking necessary action against
the culprits, Government authorities have failed to bring the culprits
on record. The normal trend of the Government during these years is to
hide the atrocities committed by the Indian armed and paramilitary forces
in order to dodge the Amenesty International and the world Human Rights
Organizations. This normal trend of dodging is still continuing.</font></font></font><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1></font></font></font>
