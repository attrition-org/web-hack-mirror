yupp you were right the first time, this website's been tagged.
you've just submitted your vote for yay0r in a movement of your
favor. for attention brought to the non-existent standards that
allowed this to happen. anyway i'm not going to rant & rave such
as i usually do. about information security and how it effects <b>you</b>.
why's that you ask? well i think i figured out i have better things
to do. you see the other night i stayed up all night and tagged <i>many</i>-a-sites,
got to the double digits, several multiples of which in fact, saw
great achievement in such a time consuming act. i sent them in as many
do an awoke the next morning to see nothing went trough, sure alldas
got one, but they didnt have that M, so what did i do? i actually
took the time to re-send them again... the confirmation page loaded,
along with my head, of the logical thoughts stupidity of the thing
that i did. i sat there one minute and not a second more, before
stood up and immediately began to pound my head on my door. omg i
thought, what the hell am i doing? alot of talk isnt really going
to help all the people whom are viewing. not to mention the fact
the thought that entered my head, of the fact that got mad for a moment
for not seeing that red, you know those colors at attrition, i think
they subliminally mess with your head. they slowly create all the
lil jerkoffs who feed on that shit, one's without a reason at all, just
to see a handle with hits.. no original idea, or even a personal vendetta,
just them clain their elitile skills which in most cases belong to
someone else only since they learned the syntax of a script try to
pass them off as their own. anyway to cut this short i'm gonna cut
this shit down a lil, not stop mind you, the common folk still deserve
the right of judgin the skizflop i spit. so all you admins out there
if it happens to you, dont even trip.. i promise not harm anything,
except maybe your logs & your index.. but it may be some time because
i'll be slowing down, i'm setting up a personal lab & beating on all
sorts of commercial software until vulnerabilities are found. i'm going
to learn new things, release code & advisories. i'm going to do all sorts
of things but then there's reality too. and over in that world i also have
things to do. oh well, i just hope people are still feelin my grewve, and
hell if are willing even work in the crew. but the goal either way is to
educate & inform, & freely release alternatives to the conglomor4t mouse
trap. so until the next broadcast from everyone's favorite fux0r, the one
bro that's been gun-ho since the placebo..<br>
<br>
-oh and might i suggest to any of the conglomor4ts responsible for the current, heh, '<i>standards</i>'
start coding around the security of your customers instead of around your time & budget. see what
you guy's may or may not know is thats where the problem in most all cases can super simply prevented
just by taking things like <i>buffer overflows</i> & file attribs. into consideration, you also
may or may not know that in what the media likes to refer to as '<i>the underground</i>' or 
whatever, programs exist and are being created for the very specific purpose of combing through
your products source code and finding these flaws. i would suggest you atleast go get yerselves
one, especially if ya cant get one of dem der clever inhouse coder fella's to make ya yer own. might
want to check out <b>slint</b> created by atstake (previously l0pht), and no i have absolutely <u>no</u>
affiliation with them, but it is a good product and those guys are more than likely more <i>clever</i>
than your guys.. anyway peace to the true and i'm through...

allowed me to deface your website, might as well have been me, because i dont
hurt anything. no grudges held, don't lose your buzz, all is well.  but you how things are mang?

about it i'm sure you'll see this probably could have been prevented, but who 
knows...
