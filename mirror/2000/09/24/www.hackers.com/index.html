</font><br><br><br><br>Hey Aaron! Remember me, right? Its OveRRidE. I informed you of a bug a while back. I found an even bigger bug, so I took the liberty of fixing it. I sent you the details (check your hdc mail).
If you allow me to keep root, Ill fix your system further free of charge. As you can see, that little bug you thought wouldnt hurt or be exploited was.
I am sorry I did this, but sometimes it takes this to show people how bad their bugs are. Again, I am sorry. I harmed nothing, just renamed index.htm and made some tmp files in /tmp. For all you seeking the REAL page, <a href="realindex.html">here it is</a>.
<br><br><br><br>Any questions from anyone, mail me at leno_2k@hotmail.com<br><br><br>Shouts to all in #code-23 on DalNET. Show up there if you need a question answered, or just wanna idle.<br><font color="red">I am for HIRE</font></body></html>
