<CENTER>&nbsp;<font face="verdana, arial" size="2">Hello all. </font></CENTER>
<p><font face="verdana, arial" size="2">&nbsp;I motion for a hacker
nation.&nbsp; All true hackers get together and unite our power.&nbsp; No, I
don't mean unite to deface, or unite to crash servers... I mean unite to combine
our intelligence, and explore more bugs, design new scripts, find our OWN
exploits.&nbsp; I am sure we can figure something out... pass messages on
through defacements... good idea.&nbsp; Just have to figure out how to keep the
hacker enthusiasts, and those pesky wanna bees...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana, arial" size="2">I have received numerous emails... (dumbasses)
about learning to hack... DEMANDS that go along the lines of TEACH ME HOW TO
HACK NOW!&nbsp; I just would like to state this for further reference that I
will never teach anyone how to hack... I will help out already experienced
hackers with programming questions, or solutions for those times when you says,
&quot;DAMN!&nbsp; There has to be another way!&quot; So if you are for real, and
not some lamer kid with a computer that deserves to be a &quot;/&lt; - Rad
h4x0r&quot; then email me.<br>
<a href="mailto:n3xus@whatthefuck.com"><font color="#99CCFF">n3xus@whatthefuck.com</font></a>
</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana, arial" size="2">And another thing about these script
bitches... <br>
Okay, you type &quot;echo I am krad &gt; to my file.html&quot; <br>
and you think you &quot;0wn&quot; someone?&nbsp; What the fuck is that?&nbsp; As
of right now, I dont even own this box... I claim no ownage, only
compromised.&nbsp; And besides, on the boxes that I &quot;own&quot; I don't
deface. I keep them and explore them.<br>
I dont want my compromise to be found unless the servers are just out right
boring... (*ahem* webmaster... Whats wrong with you? Get a decent site, with
actual interesting stuff not some shit about a party 2 years ago...)<br>
anyways, you dont 0wn shit... your momma aint shit, your daddy aint shit and
your skillz aint shit...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana, arial" size="2">Music:<br>
I love mp3z.&nbsp; Okay, who doesn't?&nbsp; I burn my cd's, yes, but thats
because i can't afford to buy cds... now, lets say perhaps Mp3z never came
out.&nbsp; Do you know what would have happened?&nbsp; At least with me?&nbsp; I
would never have started to listen to rap, techno, alternative, dance, and all
other genres that i love.&nbsp; I would have simply turned on the radio to get
my dose of music.&nbsp; But because of mp3z I actually got some taste in music
and bought 20 cds.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana, arial" size="2">I burn cd's all the time... well thats
great for you bitches at the music indusrty!<br>
Why you ask?&nbsp; Well when I play my shit, everyone who rides with me likes
it... so, they ask me who it is that sings that, and i tell them and they go buy
the cd.&nbsp; Now, lets say i didn't burn music onto a cd, again, I would be
listening to the radio.&nbsp; I have a Cable Connection, a Cd Writer, and a lot
of resources.&nbsp; But yet, i still buy cds... so go fuck yourselves riaa...
bitches...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana, arial" size="2">Ummm, thats about all i can rant about
right now...<br>
Oh!&nbsp; Fuckin turn down the gas prices... that shit costs too damn much to go
see my girl.... its like fucking $3 every fucking time i go... so fuck youz gas
prices.&nbsp; Ummmm, I fucking rock... oh, and scan this machines ports for a
little fun... </font></p>
